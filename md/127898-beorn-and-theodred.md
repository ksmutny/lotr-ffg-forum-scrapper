Hi, I have a question involging Theodred's hability and our favourite bear: Beorn.

 

As I've read recently in the forum, Biifur can target Beorn's resources because it is not targeting the hero himself, but it's "resources pool". It is the same with theodred? Or as its spelling says "choose a hero", it cannot target Beorn ?

 

What about Gaining Strength ?

 

I would say that I can use Gaining Strength on Beorn, but I can't target it with Theodred, but I'm not sure at all.

Bifur doesn´t target Beorn. Beorn targets Bifur.

 

If text says to choose or target then you cannot choose/target Beorn

Ok, my bad, the threat was not about Bifur and Beorn, but errand-rider and Beorn: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/83282-beorn-and-errand-rider/?hl=%2Bbeorn+%2Berrand [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/83282-beorn-and-errand-rider/?hl=%2Bbeorn+%2Berrand]

 

According to this... I suppose I was right... Gaining strength could work on Beorn, but Theodred don't.

You're definitely correct about Theodred because he says "choose a hero".

 

> Bifur doesn´t target Beorn. Beorn targets Bifur.

 

Beorn's not targeting Bifur either. The "to" in Bifur's ability means that the first and second half of the ability are separate effects but the second effect is dependent on the first effect's completion. The first effect simply targets the resource. I would say that the second effect targets Bifur's resource pool.

 

Gaining Strength, Errand-Rider, and Bifur all say we're adding to / discarding from a "hero's resource pool", so I assume that the resource pools are the targets and therefore they should all work.

The "first effect" doesn´t target anything: it is a cost which can be paid by anyone (unless you would argue that Beorn´s immune effect makes it so that he cannot gain that ability).

And if the target in the "second effect" had been Beorn´s resource pool then it  couldn´t trigger because of the immune effect, so for simplicity´s sake "Beorn targets Bifur" is still quite accurate enough.
