A question regarding more than one trap in the staging area:

When an enemy is revealed from the encounter deck, do the traps stack, or can I pick and choose which trap will trigger? I am leaning towards the former, but I would like to get some feedback regarding this.

I think all traps will go onto the 1st enemy revealed. Â You have no choice here.

yes, i have also played it as they stack immediatly upon the first revealed enemy. often a downfall of having several traps in the staging area at once (unless you want to stack them)
