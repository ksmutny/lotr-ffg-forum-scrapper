Hi All,

I just need some help with the guarded keyword.

I was playing Journey to Rhosgobel and drew an Athelas card from the encounter deck. As it is guarded I drew a second card. The second card I drew was also an Athelas card. Now the rules clearly state "If another objective card comes up while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place the second objective in the staging area, and use the next card of the encounter deck to fulfill the original keyword effect."

Does that mean I draw another card to guard the first Athelas card and then a second card to guard the second Athelas card?

I believe this is right (and this is where you will tell me otherwise), but I can't seem to see a FAQ response or another query on this. Any help would be appreciated.

Lee
