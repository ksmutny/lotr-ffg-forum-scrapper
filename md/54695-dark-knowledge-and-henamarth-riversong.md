So I finally got around to separating all my cards into events, heroes, attachments, and Ally stacks.

I have not gone through all the stacks yet, but I have just noticed that I only have 1 of Dark Knowledge(Attachment) and 1 of Henamarth Riversong (Ally).

 

Should I have more of these?? Will there be more cards where there will only be 1 of them?

 

I currently own all the expansion packs out and 1 core

Thank you
