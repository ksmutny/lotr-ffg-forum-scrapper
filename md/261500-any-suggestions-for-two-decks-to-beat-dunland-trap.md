Like the title says. I have all the packs up to date (apart from the new Gencon quest but that's not exactly relevant).  I've tried this quest six or seven times and never got past stage 2.

Don't rely too much on allies is great against this adventures. I already win with those fellowships in the nightmare version:

But it is one the most difficult quest in the games. You need good deck and to learn how to do. Good luck!

I beat it on regular mode with my "Dori and the Twins" fellowship:

It pairs a Noldor questing deck with the twins supported by Dori for combat.  For Antlered Crown, the key was getting as many non-item defensive support items for Elrohir in the first stage, so he can safely and repeatedly defend after being washed away.
