Card text reads: "After Aragorn commits to a quest…"

Does this action have to be done immediately after he commits? I would think that during any "action window" of the turn that takes place after he has comiited would count as a time to pay the resource and ready him,since thay all occur "after" he has committed. Or, must it occur right after he commits?

Thanks!

Since it is a Response (but not an Action), it must be used (if you want to) when the condition of trigger is fulfilled (in this case, just after Aragon is committed to a quest).  You cannot wait till the Action window to trigger his ability.

so is it wrong to commit aragorn to the quest, resolve the quest and then ready him so he can fight?
does the 2 willpower help the quest or its like i have undone my dicision to commit him?

You have to activate the Response at the moment that the trigger occurs -- at the moment that Aragorn exhausts.  So, commit Aragorn, then immediately decide whether or not you want to ready him.  Either way, he remains committed to the quest and you'll count his willpower when you resolve questing.

 

You cannot use his Response to ready him after you resolve the quest.
