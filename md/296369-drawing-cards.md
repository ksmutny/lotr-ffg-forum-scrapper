Is it mandatory to draw a card during the resource phase or can you decline to draw? This question came up during The Dunland Trap adventure. Thanks.

I had that same issue. I ruled that it was mandatory. 1.3 in the framework rules doesn't use the word 'may'. I think the designers used the draw mechanic in Dunland to key enemies abilities as they knew that you have to draw cards at least once in a game.Â

You most certainly have to draw.
