You're sponsored by FFG and got the pack before it's official release?

Oh. Last time I checked this link, it said something like "this page will become available with the release of the pack".

I wonder what additional encounter sets this quest uses...

 

bellach-trouble-in-tharbad-70.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/bellach-trouble-in-tharbad-70.jpg]

 

It states creatures, while no creatures in the quest itself.

 

There is 2 creatures that exist in the VoI set:

prowling-wolf-voi.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/prowling-wolf-voi.jpg]

 

Both belong to a two different encounter sets, which both would be extremely unthematic from my point of view to mix in with the Trouble in Tharbad, as it's an urban quest, while those two encounters are wilderness-oriented. 

 

But watching the orc synergy that might be going on there and the overall theme of pursuit, my bet would be on the set of an Orc Hound.

Yep Orc hound and the rest of misty mountain orcs. It was spoiled on the one quest card shown in the spoiler ffg released ages ago

I think the hound and other cards in misty mountain goblins work quite well thematically with the quest. Nasty Orc warriors who have come down from the mountains to help Bellach. The hound especially is like a tracking or hunting creature the spies use to help track down/outrun targets etc
