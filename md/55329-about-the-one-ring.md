 I love this game, but I was thinking if we ever are going to see something about the ring.. Finding it and later destroying it!!

What do you think?

## 2 [leptokurt on October 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=547455)

Hmmh, but if we would destroy the ring what would become of Frodo's quest? Storywise it is in Bilbo's possession during the time this game takes place, and no one knows that it is in fact The One Ring.

So how to bring The One Ring into the game?

 

For example, you could made an attachment card "The One Ring". Text would be something like:

Action: When your hero activates The One Ring, no enemy is able to attack him. Besides, he transforms into a very evil person and turns against you. Place the hero in the staging area. The hero gets a threat value of 100, an attacking value of 100, a defending value of 100 and 100 LP. Paint yourself nine Nazgul cards and place them at the top of your encounter deck. Every Nazgul gets the surge attribute. Good luck!

 

But seriously, I could see The One Ring as an attachment, but with heavy restrictions, like encreasing your threat level by 10 to get invisible for a round/phase, but giving you the advantage of being invisible (being able to attack before your enemy does without exhausting your hero, for example).

I'm kind of hoping that they leave the one ring out of the game, I don't think it is needed. Plus one of the things I love about this game is that is based on events around the core story of LOTR but not actually based on it. However it occurs to me that it might be cool to have some of the other rings...(you'd probably have to restrict them to only being able he be attached to their bearers though)

I have some hope for one of the Dwarven Rings arriving in the Khazad/Dwarrowdelf cycle, and once we have the Elf-lords I assume Narya, Nenya and Vilya will make an appearance too. 

Given the setting of this game, includign the One Ring will cause a few headaches for the designers, I assume.

Guys, you did not notice that Frodo already has a ring in this game.

His ability is designed to show he uses the ring (he gets invisible, so can't be harmed, but the threat becomes bigger as Sauron can feel it)

## 6 [Eryx_UK on October 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=547493)

The game, as I have mentioned before, is a "what if?" rather than telling stories between the two books. Give it time and I'm sure we'll see The One Ring make an apperance.

## 7 [marlow4 on October 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=547496)

Bilbo leaves the ring behind after he departs after his birthday party, so Frodo is the ring-bearer during the time period that the game takes place.

I think if we actually see it as an attachment or something like that it'll be a while from now. I don't think we'll be seeing a quest to destroy it.

The One Ring

Artefact, Attachment, Neutral, Cost: 0

Action: Use The One Ring. Stop your game immediately and do not play any further game of LotR LCG until FGG acquires the rights to produce a LCG based on the Lord of the Rings book trilogy. You may stash away your LotR LCG cards and get the "War of the Ring" boardgame out of the closet now.

 The whole Mirkwood cycle is "about" the Ring.  It's primary focus is about hunting down Gollum and getting info from him...about the ring.

Guciomir is correct. The ability of Frodo in this game closely matches what was done in the Decipher CCG with Isildurs Baine - the bearer puts the ring on and wounds become burdens (threat). From a flavour perspective they have captured the effect of Frodo having the ring without actually producing a specific card for it. Very clever.

Yes, the game is based on events between the departures of Bagginses, so at that point Frodo has already inherited the One Ring. And since his ability indeed implies its use, I hope we shall not see a card of its name.

And I also second the sentiment of having other rings, especially the three Elven rings. The Dwarven rings might have been all lost by this time.

Gath, you're correct.

As for preventing Sauron from learning of it: As of Dead Marshes, he knows who has it and where it is.

No, you're far from right here. Search for Unfinished Tales, it describes Sauron's knowledge, and it is very, very limited at this time. The Riders then make many wasteful moves before learning more, mostly from Grima Wormtongue.

Thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] does anyone know what abilities the other rings had if any? or perhaps their names even?

Three Elven Rings were individual, having separate names (Narya, Nenya, Vilya). At least in Meccg the Dwarven Rings were named one after each of the seven tribes of dwarves, not sure how many of those were actual tribes other than Durin's tribe.

## 18 [lleimmoen on October 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=547920)

Vilya

The Ring of Air was passed from Celebrimbor to the Elven king Gil-galad and later to Elrond.

Nenya

The Ring of Water was borne by Galadriel.

Narya

The Ring of Fire went from Celebrimbor to Gil-galad and later to Círdan the Ship-wright who gave it to Gandalf when he arrived in Grey Havens.

Awesome :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] so if they were to appear in the game, what kind of abilities do you think they might have? does anyone know anything about the nine rings for men and the seven for the dwarves?

## 20 [Glaurung on October 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=547937)

In Lotr Tcg from Decipher rings was quite cool cards. For example ring of fire was Artefact Play on Gandalf give him 1 more life and Ability remove burden for 3 twilight tokens. Familiar to threat and resources in this game.  Some dwarfs rings give some Attack bonus and ability to get some cards back from discard pile.

Even shadow cards use to have rings . There was some Nazguls rings also provide some bonuses to Nazguls and Witch-King.

But in this game i think rings will be Objective cards or somethings like that.

## 21 [silverhand77 on October 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=547945)

It never occured to me that you could have a ring attached to a Nazgul, I think that'd be pretty cool :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I imagine it would be some nasty effect like increasing threat or perhaps dealing an extra shadow card when it attacks. or maybe even restrict who can attack it or that which ever character does attack it must have a specific attachment like a flaming torch such as Aragorn used on Weathertop.

## 22 [radiskull on October 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=547976)

 Once the Dwarves realized what Sauron was up to, and that he could potentially influence them through the One Ring, they gathered their seven rings together and destroyed them.  They at least had the foresight to know that they would eventually be corrupted if they did not.

Ah, that explains why Gimli (at the council of Elrond) thought the one ring could be destroyed with an axe, presumably because the dwarven rings didn't have to be taken to mount doom to be destroyed, am I right?

No, this is not true. I might be behind with the rules on the game but not in the Tolkien-lore. What is true is that Dwarves were much more resilient than the Men bearing the Rings of Power. However, Sauron has recovered some of the Seven; dragons have gathered the rest within their treasure hoards.

## 25 [radiskull on October 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=548026)

Whoops, you're totally right.  Not sure where I got that idea.

 

Sauron has 3 of them, 4 of them were destroyed by dragons.

Yes. But you were totally right that Sauron was not nearly as successful with the Seven as with the Nine, and that was due to the nature of the Dwarves, even though the Rings still affected them.

Not sure if the three elvish rings will or should appear as separate cards. Like Frodo/The One Ring we could assume game designwise that these rings are incorporated in the Gandalf (and future) Elrond and Galadriel cards. I'm not a fan of high-power artifact cards that you attach to some other Hero (e.g. Brand, Son of Bain). It's the same odd feeling with the Steward of Gondor (attaching to Bilbo Baggins for example). I like the Tolkienesque low fantasy approach to the game instead of high fantasy artifact deck building (like in MtG)...

## 28 [Dam the Man on October 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55329-about-the-one-ring/?do=findComment&comment=548087)

In Meccg, Elven Rings were Short-Events whose effects lasted until the end of the turn they were used. And of course only usable for the three bearers in question. One Ring and D. Rings were items granting corruption and bonuses.
