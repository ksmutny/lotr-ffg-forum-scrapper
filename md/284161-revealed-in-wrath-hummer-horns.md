Hi guys,

If I play Revealed in Wrath at the beginning of the encounter phase and during the engagement checks Hummer horns engages me, I wouldn't receive the damage but what would happen after the end of the phase?, would I receive the damage?

Revealed in Wrath

Play only if you control a Noldor hero. Action: Choose a non-unique enemy. Until the end of the phase, treat the chosen enemy's printed text box as if it were blank (except for Traits).

Regards,

Hummerhorn's forced effect is only triggered by engagement.Â  If you blank the text for the engagement phase, you're safe.
