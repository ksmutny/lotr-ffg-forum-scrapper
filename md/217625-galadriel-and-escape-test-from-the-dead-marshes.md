Can she take it because  it is not attacking, defending, or questing? or is like a quest action?

 

 

thanks for the help.

I'd say: Yes.

Escape tests are not questing, so she'd be very good at it, in fact (running after Gollum with her dress in the swamps).

It does mean, though that you can't use her for Nenya or her own sweet, sweet ability.

Unless she has Light of Valinor, Unexpected courage or Cram on her.

Light of Valinor does nothing for Galadriel since she can't quest (Which is slightly unfortunate since she's one of the few characters who thematically should be able to have it, but never mind).

Just play one of those scenarios with textbox-blanking effects :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
