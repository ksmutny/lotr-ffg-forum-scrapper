With Boromir in play (raise threat by one to ready him) and everyone starting with 0 threat in Shadow and Flame, couldn't the player essentialy raise his threat by 9 and have Boromir do 27 damage against the balrog each turn?  Or am I reading the faq wrong about "Characters are not limited as to how many times they can participate in attacks against the same enemy, provided each attack can be legally declared, and the character is ready and eligible to be declared as an attacker."?

characters cant attack the same enemy more than once per turn….the FAQ is referring to card effects that allows this such as quick strike
