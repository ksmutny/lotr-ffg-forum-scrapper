Hello everyone,

I wondered if we could be able to play more than three gandalfs per deck since a new one is coming next month.

Here is the official answer from FFG :

> Hi Emrad,

> You can only have 3 copies of any card by title in your deck. Since both Gandalf cards have the same title you cannot include more than a total of 3 in your deck. However, you can mix-and-match if you want to play with 1 "old" and 2 "new" or vice versa.Â

I expected this, but a little part of me still wanted to believe it could have been possible to play more than 3 Gandalfs ^^

Yes you can play new Gandalf and keep him for couple of rounds. Then you play old one and reduce the threat which was added by new one (Discard him or add 2 threat in the end of the round).
