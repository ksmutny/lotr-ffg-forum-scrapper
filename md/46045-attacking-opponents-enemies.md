 when its your turn to attack, can you attack your opponents enemies or just the ones on your own side of the playing area?

Enemies engage each player individually. So the answer to your question, is only those enemies engaged against yourself.

You know this is a co-op game right?

You can talk to your fellow player and see if there is one you should engage vs having him engage and stuff like that. Might be one that your heroes might have an easier time to finish off than your friends.

 if you have a character with the ranged keyword, they can attack enemies engaged with your allies.

They can either attack during your turn on their own, or they can join an attack your ally initiates.

Thanks,

Don

also if you have a card that has the keyword sentinel on it.  you can attack if your oppenant goes undefended.

You can attack enemies engaged with your partners only with a character that has the keyword Ranged.

You can attack when it's your turn to attack or when it's your partner's turn (to add your character to his', this can be useful to attack with several characters on a big monster).

The keyword Sentinel allows you to defend vs an unopposed attack from an enemy engaged with another player. This is absolutly not the same.
