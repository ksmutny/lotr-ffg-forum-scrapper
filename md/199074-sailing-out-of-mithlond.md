I just got sea sick.  I guess I should have volunteered to be a play tester or at least a proof reader.  The explanation on the course card shows a complete or utter disregard for sailing and what the basic terms of windward and against the wind mean.

 

It will take a Herculean suspension of disbelief for me.

ooh I like Elwing's Flight. I like how it grows stronger with each copy in your discard pile. I remember Magic having a similar mechanic (forget what the keyword was called) and I really like graveyard/discard pile manipulation. I wonder how Elwing's Flight interacts with Map of Earnil? Is it still in your discard pile when you play it from there, effectively counting itself for a bigger effect, or does it not do that?

I think it was ruled that it is in your discard pile for the Shadow effect in either Carn Dum or Dread Realm that raises costs.

Is Galdor worth it? His alternate Mulligan ability seems only slightly useful to me, you can cull some of your deck. Outside of Noldor where you probably don't want too many cards in the discard I might maybe ditch 1 or 2. In Noldor deck, you could potentially ditch them all for good reasons. Either way, not that interesting. His other ability though is much more useful.

I think his abilities are quite good.  Being able to just throw some cards into the discard pile is strong if it means you have a chance at drawing a card like Steward of Gondor.

My most hated encounter card in the entire Angmar Awakened cycle was Lost in the Wilderness [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Lost-in-the-Wilderness-TLR]. If it turns up early it's essentially an auto loss. Galdor not only completely counters this card, but welcomes it. I love it.

I think that both the Sea Watcher and Elwing's Flight will be amazing in the right Elladan/Elrohir decks.

Gonna try and implement both in my Elladan, Elrohir, Arwen deck!

What Sea-watcher has to do with Elladan or Elrohir? None of them has any reliable means to put an ally on the top of your discard pile.

 

Regardless, the player cards are neat and interesting, however the encounter stuff presented is starting to feel somewhat overburdened and too complex for the sake of it to me. Time will tell, however.

I think the selective mulligan is very useful. Being able to hold onto the key cards in your hand and mulligan the rest, without having to risk losing the important stuff with a real mulligan, is huge. And the right setup can go a long way in this game.

I love the new heroes in this cycle.  They offer a lot of utility plus I'm excited about Cirdan being a powerful blue hero.  With so many weak ones, I think it's nice to have a couple heavy-hitters there.

A very small point, but I hate the fact that both Galdor and Erestor are simply "Noldor" without anything else. Are there really no fitting class/occupation for them to assign? They've even went that far recently to invent an "intrusemnt" trait for the harp solely, why leave the heroes out? 

## 17 [Fingolfin Fate on January 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199074-sailing-out-of-mithlond/?do=findComment&comment=1992146)

I had long understood the timing of the cycles and saga are independent, and as such I was not surprised to see two versions of Pippin (even both heroes) or Treebeard in very quick succession. But I am surprised now to see a hero Galdor in the new deluxe when the ally version came only three adventures ago.

 

A good hero though. Both the response and action is very intriguing. And I like how he is another Lore hero that has a one-off effect of sorts -- like Aragorn or Mirlonde in a way. But both versions of Galdor now are really dedicated to the Noldor-discard type of deck: interesting, as I would have expected one of them to be not so (Erestor is similar though).

 

Flight of the Elwing is obviously superb, from art to effect. With a sufficient drawing, I think it is best to pass on the first copy (unless you have enough Spirit resources) as the second one is already great deal: 2 resources for 2 extra willpower and two readied heroes (of either player) is just amazing.

 

And I am super excited about the other three events. Of course they will have the same cost, but what will they do? Will they all ready heroes? Giving attack (Tactics) defense (Leadership) and healing (Lore)?

 

I had already tried the Navigator. Certainly a worthy addition in an Erestor deck.

 

Undecided about the new Mithlond ally. Well, I think he is just like many Tactics cards, a reasonable design, nothing super-powerful (but she could be that too).

This!

 

Great hero, and I really like his ability.

His stats are ok, and 9 threat makes him a splurge hero still.

The second ability is also good, even without a discard deck.

I've emptied my hand often enough and wished for more cards.

The more I think about it, the more I like Galdor hero. Have to try him out soon. And I tend to agree, you really need not a dedicated discard deck to run him. Both of the abilities are useful without it. The first one can be very beneficial with it though: Elven Light, Lords of the Eldar, even Elwing's Flight now. The action would be obviously good in a money-making deck.

I think Galdors first ability is the more powerful. I dont know how often i missed one of my key Cards in a Combo deck and when drawing again i just missed the one i had in my first starting Hand. If you have 2 key Cards and are missing one  you can draw another 5 Cards and also tighten your deck in doing so.(which is always good=)

 

Second one is nice but i cant remember running out of Cards that often in my games.(if you are not playing certain mechanics that is)

> Second one is nice but i cant remember running out of Cards that often in my games.(if you are not playing certain mechanics that is)

 

I don't typically run out of cards in my hand unless I'm playing mono-tactics.  The reason I don't is because I typically design my decks in a way that I never run out of cards since running out of cards is usually bad (barring certain scenarios, of course).  With that said, having access to this hero/ability means that you can build some really effective blitz decks.  It's truly amazing.  I think it will open up a lot of interesting deck designs.

Any ideas of what Narya may do?  It definitely provides a sphere as both of the three before have.  It has to be either lore or leadership.   The three were used for preservation and not aggression so tactics is out.  Leadership would round out the spheres and fits Gandalf and Cirdan well as they are both leaders.  Cirdan mentioned that it could be used to rekindle the fire in the hearts of men when he gave it to Gandalf.  It would be easy to interpret this as a readying ability as it's one of leaderships token capacities.

 

Lore would work just as well though, with Gandalf and Cirdan both existing since at least the awakening at cuivenen or very nearly so in Cirdan's case.  That's a lot of time to pick up knowledge.  This is probably more likely as Elrond and Galadriel  both share spirit and lore when equipped, and the more powerful Noldor cards tend to inhabit these spheres. For Gandalf's sake Word of Command is basically a spell in the lore sphere and it would make sense for him to be equipped in such a was as to cast it. 

 

With what's been spoiled so far, between Gandalf's strange payment protocols and Cirdan's existence as a fulcrum for Noldor discard builds I could foresee the ring doing something similar to the Wizard pipe, except between the top of the deck and the top of the discard pile.  It would definitely be a very useful ability for both deck types, as ridiculous as the last of the Elven rings being equivalent in power to Gandalf's pipeweed piece. 

 

All of this is assuming that the final elven ring appears with Cirdan in The Gray Havens as opposed to The Flame of the West for Gandalf. It be a shame if it wasn't compatible for both of them.

The first thing that pops to mind when thinking about Narya is how it was used to kindle the hope in the hearts of men and spur them to action. That equals Leadership to me. Now, as for the effect itself I think it will not be too complex or weird or interact with the top card of anything. I think it may be more basic and straightforward. I don't think they want to make the Gandalf-Elrond deck any more powerful. I think that recursion would be very possible, since with Círdan you'll be discarding a lot of cards. Whatever it is, if it grants Leadership it will be very interesting for splashing Leadership in decks or even complementing already heavy Leadership decks with either Gandalf and Círdan.

With "Limit once per game", if I trigger it and then use the event to let another player take control of Galor, will they be able to trigger the effect as well?

## 26 [Fingolfin Fate on January 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199074-sailing-out-of-mithlond/?do=findComment&comment=1993411)

Interesting ideas about Narya. I wonder if both Círdan and Gandalf will be potential targets, or just Gandalf. This game is all about possibilities, and then you get Vilya, a Ring of Power that has also changed bearers, and it can be only attached to Elrond, whilst at the same time you can attach Steward of Gondor to any hero. There has been a lot of discussion about this, of course. But I feel they might go less with the theme and more with consistency and have Narya only attachable to Gandalf. But then again, probably not if it appears in the Grey Havens. Any implication it will happen there?

 

Thinking of the card distribution in the box, we know there will be a 2-cost event for every sphere, and judging by the two allies, there might also be a 2-cost Noldor ally for each sphere. I hope they will do the same for attachments… and I am really looking forward to see Leadership cards in this box because so far we have got very little Leadership Noldor stuff...

You mean Desperate Alliance, right. I think the official ruling is exactly so: once per player. I rather give that card a pass because it tends to get ridiculous with Aragorn, for instance.

Well, we're not getting a Gil-Galad hero or ally anytime soon, so it makes sense to restrict it to Elrond. Narya, assuming it comes in The Grey Havens, will probably attach to both Círdan and Gandalf.

Hero Galdor is awesome (and I love his art, though the coat is a little 18th Century for Middle-Earth) but he’s also pretty niche. He’s going to help those Noldor effects that really want to get certain cards into your discard ASAP. Plus once you ditch your whole hand for effect we basically get a new setup hand off a thinned deck.

 

Outside of that Noldor discard deck though…he’s kind of meh. His abilities aren’t bad but they aren’t anything all that special either. His setup ability can help you build towards larger 2 or 3 card combos by keeping one part and going fishing for the rest. He’s 8 threat with Mirlonde with whom he has some Noldor/Silvan synergy. Ally Galdor likes him (which I find thematically-consistant and mechanically annoying).

 

All-in-all he’s a solid, niche Hero—nothing wrong with that.

 

I do worry a little bit though that the Noldor-Discard deck is getting a lot of love right now.  Obviously we don’t have an exact listing of all the cards in the upcoming Deluxe and APs but that deck archetype already has 4 solid Heroes (Erestor, Cirdan, Arwen and now Galdor), not to mention a lot of released and spoiled support. I get that thematically it fits with the Grey Havens but I worry a little that we’ll start to see other things that could use some attention get passed over for more focus on this deck-type.  I mean, we now have two Galdor’s focusing on Noldor-Discard—a mechanism that barely existed not long ago.

This whole cycle feels more Hornblower than Lord of the Rings to me.

I'm personally a bigger fan of the game than the lore (I don't dislike Tolkeen, but I wouldn't call myself a fan) so the setting change doesn't bother me. If it allows for interesting, fresh mechanics then I'm okay with it. But more freedom can lead to over-complication--something that is seen a lot in the "Pirate"-genre in board/card games (I'm looking at you Pathfinder: Skull & Shackles) so I am hoping they manage to keep everything well-streamlined.

I fully expected this type of comment, and I see the reason behind it. But it actually makes zero sense to me. It is not like Gil-Galad had the only one option to give Vilya to Elrond, he could have chosen someone else, and would have chosen had Elrond not been around, probably. It was not an heirloom like Narsil. And so could Círdan, had he found a different Istari more fit.

Still, even though it makes little thematic sense to restrict Vilya to Elrond, I understand the design behind it since it is such a powerful card.

That all said, it may very well be that Narya will be for both Círdan and Gandalf.

Sure, they could have given the rings to other people.  But among the heroes that exist in the card game (or ever will exist), Elrond is the only one that ever possessed Vilya (and likewise for Galadriel with Nenya).  Meanwhile, both Cirdan and Gandalf possessed Narya at some point.

## 35 [Seastan on January 16, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199074-sailing-out-of-mithlond/?do=findComment&comment=1994261)

All the rings so far have required the hero to exhaust with them. Seeing as how we'd have to exhaust a big hero like Gandalf or Cirdan, I would expect the effect to be really powerful.

 

My guess for the effect is something like: Attach to Cirdan or Gandalf. Exhaust Narya and attached hero to move the top card of your discard pile to the top of your deck.

 

It allows for some powerful recursion, and combos well with both Gandalf and Cirdan.

## 36 [John Constantine on January 16, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199074-sailing-out-of-mithlond/?do=findComment&comment=1994299)

I think, repetetive returner would be too much even with exhaustion of someone as powerful as Cirdan or Gandalf. Just think of ednless Tests of Will, not a single treachery triggerting entire game.

 

Also, Ring of Barahir does not requires anyone to exhaust :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Yes, a good point about exhausting: for the Three Elven Rings. It will most likely be the case again. And true, exhausting Gandalf or Círdan seems on par with Elrond. It makes sense Nenya is cheaper and less powerful because Galadriel can only exhaust for her ability otherwise. It is no easy thing to design Narya, surely. I think they will try to stick to the theme in terms that Vilya is the most powerful of the three but if Narya exhausts Gandalf (or Círdan) it will have to have a very powerful effect too.

 

To recover the top card of the discard pile could be it. It is certainly immensely powerful, yet obviously not so productive as using Vilya.

I do empty my hand sometimes.

I often run alot of 0 & 1 cost cards. Some 2 cost cards, and a few 3 cost cards in most decks.

And those few really need to be worth the 3 I pay imo, as it takes a whole turn to just play one, instead of 2 or even 3 other cards. 

Card cost is a important factor to me, as I rarely play leadership.

So yea, I like his abilities.

 

The more I think about his stats, the more I am just 'ok' with those.

Would rather have seen him 3/1/1/3 with 8 threat, making him more splashable. (is that a word?) edit: google says yes, but in card game terms.

I'm the opposite. The game is fun, but I wouldn't be playing it if it weren't for the IP. I've generally avoided the invented characters and less "authentic" quests.

 

Might change my tune once I've run out of stuff to buy, though. Who knows?

Not to the topic that much but I am the same: I wouldn't be playing the game if it were not Middle-earth related. So theme definitely comes first for me, deck-building and all, but I also really like the entire design (including art), the player vs game is great.

By the way, forgot to mention, but I'm really in love with the

(those curves...)

 

1/1/0/2 is like a golden standard for a 2-costed ally, and it's nice to see 1wp on a 2-costed ally of Tactics. But the real deal is 3 attack and Ranged at the cost of two (ally on top of discard pile is easily arrangeable). 

 

Yet there is one little thing that made me cringe... her text is kinda similar with what I was trying to "rework" Horseback Archer into:

Poor guy is getting outclassed by literally every other ranged attacker on the block. I guess I'll have to do something else for him, like a response to someone rohan leaving play that grants him 1 attack until the end of the phase or something.

Yes, Horseback Archer is a poor guy. The design learning process have been great throughout the existence of the game. In the beginning there were super powerful and super weak cards. The distribution is much more interesting now. And some of the cards have developed very well (sometimes perhaps too well -- Love of Tales).

 

I think the Mithlond Sea-watcher is indeed very good. 1 willpower for 2 cost in Tactics is special. 2 hp never hurts. I am not sure the bonus is so easy to achieve even in a dedicated deck, but it is certainly achievable. Haven't tried it yet. My Elven Tactics deck usually do not run so many allies but perhaps that will change if we actually get some good ones like this guy.

Tactics has plenty of cheap defenders to chump (and go on top of your discard pile) with. Even more, Winged Guardian, Watcher of Bruinen and Vassal of the Winlord have self-discarding forced effects, Westfold Outrider can go on top of your discard pile at will. Exceedingly more ways to have an ally on the top of your deck if you're pairing Tactics with other spheres.

I can definitely see running a set of those when Elladan is around.

> I can definitely see running a set of those when Elladan is around.

It's not the first time I hear someone mentioning them and Elladan together, but I still fail to see their exact synergy.

 

My closest bet is Elven Spear, however there is also Legolas from Tactics who can have it, as well as various heroes from other spheres.

Yeah, the twin decks is exactly a type of deck where allies are more scarce (to put on top of the discard pile). I guess Eagles is a good pairing, though I always try to have Vassals and co. attached to the Eagles of the Misty Mountains. Elven Spear is a natural combo. And Protector for a defender, though different sphere.

## 48 [PsychoRocka on January 17, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199074-sailing-out-of-mithlond/?do=findComment&comment=1995905)

Maybe just cause they are Noldor (boosts power of lords of the eldar running noldor heroes and allies), elladan is in sphere with the ally and cause the brothers go great with their sister who is amazing with this ally.
My elladan, elrohir, arwen deck only runs four events; feint, sneak attack, elven light and lords of the eldar.
lords is meant to be played from your discard and is put back into your deck and elven light doesn't stay in the discard pile for long.
The deck also has galadriel and gandalf ally, both of whom go to discard at the end of the round.
Finally the best part of this is Arwen herself who can pitch an ally at any time to ensure this ally is getting the bonus. With these varying factors as well as the Derndingle ally who often falls to nasty enemy attacks at some point this deck can actually fairly reliably keep an ally on top of the discard or get one to the top by playing the copy of Light/Lords on top of it or in an emergency can simply discard an ally with Arwen.

I think putting this new ally in this deck is a no brainer and am trying to figure out what will come out for it.

 

You are right thought and Elladan and Elrohir do not directly have any effect or synergy with the new ally, I think it is more the sort of cards and decks the brothers are included in or used in conjunction with that gel with the new ally so myself and others could have explained better for sure.

I don't know, I think thats pigeon-holing the brothers a little too much. The deck I use with them has a fair few allies, I think around 18 from memory.

I get what you are saying though as you obviously need resources to fuel their abilities hence cannot play as many allies because of this but with resource acceleration like steward, arwen hero, grima hero etc and by running lower cost allies you can still very easily make effective decks with the brothers that are not light on allies. They also obviously do better in decks that are more attachment heavy but you can easily have a deck that has a good balance of allies and attachments.

Also yeah not sure about eagles for the reason you laid out yourself, you want to attach all your discarded eagles to your copies of Eagles of the Misty Mountains to buff them into monsters not put them in your discard pile..

It seems a really fun deck you have there mr Psycho, how well does it do solo? Not that I play solo much but I still try decks that way before pairing them up. And if coop, what type of deck do you play with it?

Recently I have tried Théodren, Arwen, Aragorn (Lore), having not used Théodred and even Strider for a long time. It tries to reap Elven-light as much as possible. I like to have strong allies out: Gandalf (Hobbit), Glorfindel, Gildor, Galdor, Erestor and the one-rounders Elrond and Galadriel. But the deck still needs fiddling with.

The prediction of Narya seems pretty real.

When Cirdan appeared, I wrote that Galdor will be the other for sure (like a lot of users also), so it is no surprise. His abilities are great though. I too like that mulligan thing. In lots of games I had one card i really wanted on my hand but the others were not, so had to mulligan but it was hard. Now this is solved. Also his other ability will be interesting since i often find my self with no cards at hand.

Mithlond seawatcher is like magic .... feels like she guards Valinor or something. Also the ability is great for the Noldors and can work well with Lindon Navigator who discards after quest or you discards another card.

For a first age fan like me, a card with Elwings name on is a must even if it does nothing, like Tinuviels tale, so i like it anyway but the ability is a good one and can beof a great help late in a game when you can ready three characters with it.

Can't wait for Narya ... Maybe it can boost willpower since it was a ring that inspired the others, but this is very common, and Nenya does this already in a way, so not much of a chance. Hope it is something great though

I really believe that a defensive Noldor attachment should appear in this cycle. I think it is needed

A Silmarillion fan here also. I agree with most of the above, especially Elwing.

 

Not sure about the Noldor defensive thing. You have the Protector of Lórien already. Or you mean a non-discarding one? Because then you've got Elven mail, even though it gives no extra defense strength.

My problem now is that I have Noldor stuff in three or four decks already. And more is coming I fear (and hope). I really wish for the unique allies, and another Gildor (hero or ally). He is the very first Elf we meet in the Lord of the Rings. But maybe they count the saga encounter one and think two versions are enough.

A non discarding that raises defence is what I would like. Noldor work a lot with discarding cards and eventually if they discard to do everything they will run out of cards pretty quick  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]. There might be a problem here in the future

Yes, there is that problem. But I like it that way: I mean from the designing point of view. A player must be more careful putting the deck together, not like with Outlands, for instance, where you just add all their cards in.

 

Yes, I want to see more Noldor generic stuff. I really wonder what the Tactics event Revealed in Wrath might do...

Ha, a very nice attachment, it would work well cause it does not neet itself a card to discard but can take advantage of discarding card for another action. That would be good indeed

Yes, this would be clever. But they did not go with the shield trait, unfortunately. Well, I think it is always better to have more traits than less. I like traits a lot. But it can be a problem too, to have too many, and not enough cards to support them. And not everything can make sense. Once you can have two mails, two shields is no issue

You can just use the restricted Keyword. If someone wants to hold a shield in each hand, they can, they just give up their ability to carry a weapon.

 

Mounts, however...

## 63 [John Constantine on January 20, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199074-sailing-out-of-mithlond/?do=findComment&comment=2002177)

There is a restricted keyword, the thing I was afraid is combinations of this and/or Gondorian Shield creating mountains of defense on a single hero.

 

As for mounts, I wonder how you'll perceive the global change I made to them (I really hope we get to play some time soon :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).

Not sure if anyone has mentioned or discussed this yet but just picked up another cool trick with the new Galdor Hero.

His first ability that lets you discard cards from your opening hand rather than taking a mulligan and then drawing that many cards can not only get you an optimal starting hand but for Noldor discard decks can actually set you up even more than that if you are lucky.

Say you get an opening hand that includes the new ally version of Glorfindel and any copies of Lords of the Eldar you can discard them to draw new cards and you don't really lose out on these discards because you can play both of these cards from the discard pile anyway.

I know there are already many ways to easily discard cards in a Noldor deck but with Galdor you can start the first round with certain cards already in your discard without using any effects to do so and more importantly it negates the drawback of discarding these cards to draw new ones to begin with.

## 65 [John Constantine on February 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199074-sailing-out-of-mithlond/?do=findComment&comment=2036369)

...well, that was kinda obvious. Essentially the same thing as discarding cards like Elven Light with Arwen, which are not supposed to be played from hand in the first place.
