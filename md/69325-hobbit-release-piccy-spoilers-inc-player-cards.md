1.  Gollum looks like Kreacher from the Harry Potter movies.

2.  It's still Dungeons Deep and Caverns Grim.  Guess they screwed that one up good.

3.  I just picked up my copy, but haven't opened it yet.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 Good news!  I couldn't stand it any longer and cracked my box open - even though I'm at work.  In the rule booklet and on the adventure cards it's "Caverns Dim".

 First, it's an Objective, not a Treasure.  It's automatically attached to Bilbo at the start of the 3rd adventure.

Artifact.  Ring.

Attach to Bilbo Baggins

Action:  When attempting to answer a riddle, spend 1 (Baggins) resource to discard an additional card."

Action:  Exhaust Bilbo's Magic Ring and raise each player's threat by 2 to add 1 (Baggins) resource to Bilbo Baggins' resource pool.

 

Bilbo is separate from the rest of the party at the beginning of this quest and must complete the riddle game.  He has his own quest card.

I saw on the other thread, I wish the focus was better, nevertheless, thanks!! The dwarfs look very dwarfy.

I suppose the proper adjective would be "dwarvish"

interesting rules text for bilbo: "this new version of bilbo baggins cannot be used as a hero when playing any scenario from a product other than the hobbit: over hill and under hill."

 

sounds like a 3rd bilbo might be expected in the 2nd saga expansion?!

For those that have not seen them, and sadly im not able to put up pictures of my cards, Magali Villenueve has once again done a truly amazing job!! Also, spare cloak and hood and the troll key are, in my opinion, the only disappointing art.  Have not played yet, will be doing so SOON!!

 Just finished my first try versus We Must Away… And won it by "Carrocking" the quest.  There are a lot of new mechanics going on and a few things that aren't so well explained (surprise!), but it's a fun little quest.  There's a good chance I made some mistakes along the way.  The treasures aren't gained until the end of the quest so you can't use them until you defeat this one.  I really wanted to build a dwarf deck for this quest with Thorin at the very least, but being a bit pressed for time I just grabbed my Estel deck that I've been using in Dwarrowdelf.  I'm going to try to build a dwarf deck for this, but I doubt it will be as easy.

The big news is card draw for Tactics.

The tactics card look awesome indeed.

Foe-Hammer, 0 cost, event, Response: After a hero you control attacks and destroys an enemy, exhaust a Weapon card attached to that hero to draw 3 cards.

Goblin-Cleaver, 0 cost, event, Combat Action: Exhaust a Weapon card attached to a hero you control to choose an enemy engaged with you. Deal 2 damage to that enemy. (Deal 3 damage instead if the enemy is an Orc.)
