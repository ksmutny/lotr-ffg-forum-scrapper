I must admit I've been a bit of a power gamer with this game, perhaps due to its difficulty, but I was all about pulling together the best deck and combinations regardless.

Well, now I've decided to try and be more themed.  I'm getting Legolas and as many Silvan themed cards as I can for a Silvan theme deck.  I like the thought of them all in the forest springing their Forest Snares.  The Silvan Tracker is the first to make use of this trait, so hopefully we'll see some more like that.

I'm also going to take the games a lot slower and think about the story and what's happening more, rather than just the mechanics.  I remember an article FFG did about the different types of player - well I think I'm becoming a Bilbo!

 I'm going to so Bilbo once I can get my hands on more Dwarves. 

Nowadays I am about 50/50 Bilbo/Boromir.

 I am SUCH a Bilbo.

I regularly look at my decks and think things like "Oh man, this deck would be a lot better with Prince Imrahil than Theodred, but I CAN'T change it! It's a Rohan deck!" 

I was very excited to make a Gondor deck once I got Boromir. The deck kinda sucks, but it's full of Gondor cards!

Wow.  I could have typed this.  Exactly!

 Once we started getting the song cards I created a Dwarf deck because I was able to play Lore Dwarven characters to fill it out. I couldn't win a single game. However, it looks like my dream of a stunty deck is about to come true :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I relate a lot to the first post. I think of myself as a 50% Pippin, 40% Bilbo, and 10% Boromir type of gamer. When I first get a game this doesn't show up right away, as I like to get a solid footing underneath me, win a few, get comfortable with the game mechanics... but then, not too long in to building familiarity, the curiosity factor from the Pippin in me and the love for a good theme from the Bilbo in me start to kick in. And this is exactly what keeps this particular game feeling so replayable. The fun isn't done once I've beaten a particular quest. Not by a long shot. The question then quickly starts to become more about the "how I got there" than the actual end result. There are so many different paths to take. And "not all those who wander are lost." gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

It's a story every time... not always a winning story (as in victory), but sometimes fresh ideas and tightly themed decks provide a different kind of win (no matter the outcome), and with new heroes coming out all the time, the possibilities are just going to keep getting sweeter.

I've always considered myself a Boromir player. But with Dain Ironfoot coming out, I'm very excited about making a dwarf deck(in fact, I've already pieced it together). Does that mean I have some Bilbo in me? NOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

Don't fight it. Resistance is futile. Pretty soon you'll be discarding Boromir to finish off a horde of enemies--EVEN WHEN IT WILL HURT YOUR SCOREdemonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

LOL, I've already done it. Finished off a Wolf Rider, 2 Eastern Crows, a Goblin Sniper and a badly damaged Hill Troll. In my defense, I was going to lose, so it didn't matter and I did it purely out of spite. Although, to be perfectly honest, I don't even keep track of my score anymore, I just concentrate on winning against the quest. Perhaps that's Boromir reasserting himself?

Oh, I'm definitely with you. Solid artwork gets a card into my deck no matter how useless it might be. My deck might be weaker, but it'll make the quest more nail-biting to finish!

I'm actually working on an all-Magali deck, in which all cards are illustrated by Magali Villeneuve. You can actually get up to a 45-card deck, but it's still missing a third hero (only Legolas and Eleanor at the moment). Yes, that means three copies of Nor Am I A Stranger and Second Breakfast. Yes, that means playing Legolas without any other Tactics cards, but you also get fatties like Elfhelm, Gildor Inglorion, and Haldir. Plus, she illustrated Song of Wisdom, so you'll even be able to use all of the Lore cards!

The only downside is that turns start to take a really long time as you admire the art happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Well, I've built my 'Bilbo & The Elves' deck now and successfully taken them through Mirkwood a couple of times.  The deck certainly needs a lot of things to go right for it to win, but it's been a lot of fun because of the theme.

It's Lore/Tactics with Spirit splashed in.  Mainly a Silvan deck - Legolas calling in the Elves to aid the party, with Bilbo singing merry songs to assist the party. 

Getting the Spirit cards out is obviously reliant on getting Song of Travel, but they can usually be burned with Protector of Lorien if I find myself not able to play them.

A nice little combo that came out was Bilbo having Song of Mocking to shunt damage across to Legolas who would get healed at the end of the round by a Silvan Tracker.

Heroes:  Bilbo Baggins, Berevor, Legolas

Cards:

Forest Snare x 3

Protector of Lorien x 3

Secret Paths x 3

Fast Hitch x 3

Henmarth Riversong x 3

Silvan Tracker x 3

Daughter of the Nimrodel x 3

Haldir of Lorien x 3

A Burning Brand x 3

Blade of Gondolin x 3

Song of Mocking x 3

Song of Travel x 3

Song of Wisdom x 3

Unexpected Courage x 2

The Galadhrim's Greeting x 2

Hasty Stroke x 2

A Test of Will x 3

Lorien Guide x 2

 Does someone have the link to this article that explains the player types?

 

If not, can someone summarize it here?  I'm interested to see what player type I am...

## 18 [starhawk77 on December 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57041-im-becoming-a-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=563660)

Here's the article: javascript:void(0);/*1323018934348*/ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2296] 

In short: Bilbo=thematic player, Pippin=lover of quirky combos and strange card interactions, and Boromir=power gamer (i.e., win at all costs).
