no because you would be targettting him with the effect, and his immunity doesnt allow it to work

But errnad-rider doesn't target, they "move 1 resource from the resource pool of a hero you control to another hero'r resource pool", it is considered as targeting?

mmmmm……not so sure actually, i would say it is targetting, but then again it doesnt say 'choose a hero' ..but there are cards that do target in a non obvious way.

i would wait until another confirms or otherwise as i tend to get confused haha. ill have a look at the FAQ in the meantime

Hi Richard,
A hero's resource pool belongs to but is separate from the hero. Beorn's immunity to player card effects does not extend to his resource pool. So it is possible to use the Errand-rider to move resources to or from Beorn's resource pool.
Cheers,
Caleb
