Do forced effects resolve simultaneously? If I have two copies of a card that both tell me to reveal an extra card at the beginning of the encounter phase if there are less than 2 enemies in the staging area and have two enemies in the staging area after I resolve the first copy, do I still reveal another for the second copy because "at the beginning" of the phase I had 0 enemies? Or do the enemies that were revealed count for the second copy?

I think the trigger is simultaneous. Â You have to resolve the effects one by one, but the trigger for each of them ("at the beginning of the encounter phase") was the same, so I would resolve both of those effects, regardless of how many enemies were in the staging area after resolving the first card's effect.

I thought so, that's how I played it too. Just felt like if you really read the card, that's what it said to do. Needless to say that playthrough didn't go well, lol. Thanks.
