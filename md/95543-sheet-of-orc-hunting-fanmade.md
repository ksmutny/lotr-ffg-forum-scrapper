I have just finished the Orc Hunting [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/94572-orc-hunting-fanmade/]fanmade, only i need to know if the english text of the sheet file is correct.

Can you read and correct the text? Please tell me if there are errors.

Yeah on the part where it talks about the Risk keyword, it should read,

 

"...extra large bands of orcs that roam the largely Dark Forest and Camp in strange and unknown places."

 

So change Camped into Camp because when you say "..bands of orcs that roam.." that is talking about a present/ongoing thing.  But you say "camped" right after which is past tense that means that the orcs don't camp anymore; it was something that happened in the past.  So put in "camp" to show they are currently doing it.

 

And I noticed when you say "Orcs of the Dark Forest Deck" various times on the rule sheet, you have it bold some places and not bold other places.  So I'd change it to one or the other.  

 

Other than that it looks great to me!

I would play the quest but I'm not sure my printer could handle the great art very well (besides, ink is so darn expensive I'd cost a fair amount to print it) and I don't sleeve my cards so it would be kinda weird to shuffle paper. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  And I dont even want to think about how long it would take to cut out all those cards so yeah........Post a thread later about how the quest works, the difficulty, the nastiest cards and all that stuff.

Ok, thanks for the ideas.

 

I corrected them, and i have upload the sheet of the first post.

 

PD: there are 100 cards as a total. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  Maybe too much. The idea is to play it in octgn plattform, or lots of friends print together lots of copies by, for example, printerstudio [http://www.printerstudio.com/]. (The problem is maybe shuffle the decks! <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png] )

PD2: i have tested it several times, and it is very funny! Alone, 2 players, 3 and 4. I have seen it is impossible with normal decks (you can't play allies, only one round because at the end of the round you must discard them), but with specific decks it is much more easy. The most dificult is 4 players, and the most easy is 2 players (or one). You need lots of cards and habilities to return to ready the heroes, this is the question in this scenario. But you learn lots of things here. You learn to use more usually attachments and events. There are useless cards that here are very good. And the most important cards here have the same theme like this scenario (for example, attachments dunedain...). Finally, you become a great heroe to play other combat quests!!! (this is the objective of the quest: gain experience and recognition by your folk :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png] ). Enjoy!!!

 

How about, must i correct any word more in the sheet file? Thanks

Well I don't do any of that OCTGN crap. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Thats all I could find for mistakes.

Lol, octgn is good when you can't play with friends all together. In octgn you can meet with them online, or know more players (and shuffle decks in only 1 second!!! :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] ). Thanks for the corrections!

Yeah well I am careful on how much crap I load up on my computer if you know what I mean.  I have no clue how big OCTGN is so maybe its not a problem but I'm good with the cards for now.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I added this text at the end of the text (last paragraph):

 

Limit once per round. If there are any risk locations in play, only trigger the risk keyword with the highest risk value.

Is it correct?

I have made one change:

 

First the phrase said:

"Limit once per round. If there are any risk locations in play, only trigger the risk keyword with the highest risk value"

 

One friend said that it is better:

'Limit once per round. If there are any risk locations in play, only trigger the risk location with the highest risk value".

 

...changing 'risk keyword' by 'risk location'

 

But i don't like so because it could seems that all the location is not triggered (quest points, threat etc). Other way is sure that only i'm speaking about the keyword.

 

Now I have changed by the next text:

'If there are any risk locations in play, only the risk keyword with the highest value is considered to be active'.

 

 

Is it better?

I think yes:

'Limit once per round' is no needed.

And i dont like use 'trigger' when i am talking about locations with 'passive' keywords.

 

Can you find other way to say it better?
