Hi !

I'm french and I don't speak english verywell but I have a question.

At the beginning of the quest phase, we have an action, but can you do an action after sending our characters in the quest? Before revealing the cards?

It's very important, because if we can do that, we straighten the characters before revealing the treachery and therefore resist some effects.

Yes, there is an Action Window between the commit characters step and the staging step.  Noted, however, there is no Action Window during the staging step (i.e. in between revealing multiple cards from the encounter deck).
