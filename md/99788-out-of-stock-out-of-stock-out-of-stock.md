My wife and I recently got into the LotR lcg but am thinking it must be a terrible time to have started playing.

 

Hobbit, out of stock

Khazad-dum, out of stock

Black Riders, out of stock

Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, mostly out of stock

Dwarrodelf cycle, mostly out of stock

 

The scant handful of places that do have some of the above in stock have 50%+ markups on the expansions.

 

Supposedly there was a reprint of mirkwood recently, but if so then it's not made it to distributors yet.

 

Best to just put it back on the shelf and wait a few months in the hope the situation changes?

Uhm,

 

I would go to the FFG webstore through this site.

 

The only out of stock LOTR LCG items are the core set and one of the hobbit sets (oh and the sets that haven't been released yet). The entire mirkwood cycle was reprinted and shipped out two weeks ago, local retailers may be out but check out the official FFG source, or check out http://teamcovenant.com/store/the-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-3.html [http://teamcovenant.com/store/the-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-3.html]

 

Everything is in stock again except one of the hobbit expansions and the newest deluxe expansion.

 

I picked up the full mirkwood cycle last week from my LGS, so it's definitely made it to distributors.

right, most everything was just reprinted or is about to be.

 

this is a great place to shop online:

I'm in the UK. Shipping from the US would see prices more than double on anything ordered. Mirkwood might have made it to US distributors, but it's not made it to the UK (and won't be arriving this week coming, likewise khazad-dum, dwarrowdelf etc.). This despite Isengard apparently coming out this week at the same time as the US gets it.

Try www.gameslore.co.uk [http://www.gameslore.co.uk]. On a quick glance they have some (but not all) of the sets you name in stock [including The Hobbit part 1, which is a good place to start if you just have the Core Set], and they aren't overcharging. I've always found them very reliable.

This issue comes up a lot. Might be worth having a thread or notice to this affect pinned somewhere. Anywho, check with your local game store; they often have some stock that lasts longer than the internet, and it's good to support a local gaming spot. I don't know timing for crossing the pond, but yeah; I recently got redhorn gate and road to rivendell on reprint, they come around regularly.

 

It is worth pointing out that they design every new box set with a new player in mind. If you have a core set and get the new Voice of Isengard, and get the adventure packs that come out using this deluxe expansion, then you will be very well equipped for the quests in this new cycle.
