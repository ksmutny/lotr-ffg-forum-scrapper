It stays until discarded by "discard any attachment" or "discard any condition", note you do not control the attachment so it cannot be "discard a controlled attachment" or any variation.

 Miner of the Iron Hills specifically discards "Condition" attachments, so this is a good play :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This condition is crippling in solo play and i my experience results in a loss. At this point in the game development there's just not enough player cards that can remove conditions. Fortunately there's also not many conditions. This situation makes "caught in a web" feel like an unlucky game breaker draw.

i like to put Caught in the Web onto Aragorn so I can ready him for 1 during questing and if I am in trouble, I can use him to defend (at the cost of 2 resources to ready him later).  it's not so terrible playing like that, but does somewhat alter your playing.

Does that work? If Aragorn is already exhausted he can't commit to the Quest so can't pay 1 resource to ready himself.

Presumably Aragorn would be ready during the quest phase that Caught in a Web was revealed.  The only thing to exhaust him at that time would be questing, and his ability would most likely have been used to ready him.

perhaps i should have clarified, but if Aragorn is ready at the time of attachment, you can quest with him and only pay 1 resource to ready him each turn.  If you need him to defend or attack you have to pay 2 resources to satisfy caught in the web.

There are a few cards that ready characters and even fewer to remove it. I have found the caught in the web card is annoying to say the least.
