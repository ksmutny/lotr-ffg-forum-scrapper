# [Do you use cards from Adventure Packs Scenarios that you have not played yet?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83660-do-you-use-cards-from-adventure-packs-scenarios-that-you-have-not-played-yet/)

I have APs: Hunt for Gollum (finished successfully), Conflict at Carrok (unsuccessful), Journey to Rhosgobel (unopened), Hills of Emyn Muil (unopened), Return to Mirkwood (unopened), Khazad-dum (played only the easiest scenario).  I stopped playing LotR and thought of selling the unopened packs to buy the easiest Dwarrowdelf AP but decided to keep them for now.

Considering I've got 3 unopened APs and already bought the Watcher in the Water and thinking of buying Road to Rivendell as well, should I just open the APs even if I don't plan to play the their scenarios yet (too hard for me)?  I feel like I shouldn't open the AP just to get the use the player cards without even attempting to play the quest scenarios in them (would that be cheating?)?

Do others use in their decks player cards from APs even if they haven't played (or at least, postponing to play the scenario, may be due to difficulty level to high, too hard)?

Some people feel that playing with the cards that were released after that particular quest is cheating… Others don't…

 

It is up to you…

 

I personally like to play with all cards that are at my disposal… What gives me the most fun is to try and beat the scenario, doesn't matter the card pool available….

 

But i respect every opinion…

 

PS: Rich I have also reported this guy twice…

This sort of implies power creep.  Is there one?  And, if so, is it necessary to keep up with increasing difficulty of quests?

thats a tough one- my answer would be that power creep is inevitable, but i do not think its a problem. i mean some of the most powerful cards in the game (some would say THE most powerful) are from the core set- steward of gondor, feint, thicket of spears.

i think its more a case of more powerful ways to combo cards- for instance thicket of spears was ok in core set, but it was hard to pull off a 3 tactics deck. but now with hama to recycle those cards and excellent tactics heros its one of the best combos in the game.

so i think thats the best way to describe it

I got into the game late so I ended up acquiring most of the older APs all at once when I decided to complete my collection intending to play them all in original order. While I did open them and sort out the cards I have this weird thing that I like to beat a scenario with only the cards released up until that point.

Afterwards I'll play it again with different kinds of decks using all the cards but I like to do it at least once (and not just a flukey win) with only the card pool that was available at the time. I don't view using newer cards as cheating at all and I actually think they have handled power creep pretty well (though a bit is always inevitable).

I guess it's just a weird quirk I have that I like to do it with older cards first and experiment with the more limited deck building options before trying anything else. But that's what I find fun, if you think you would have more fun dumping all your packs into one to create your ultimate deck to run wild on Passage through Mirkwood do it.

The game is designed to be fun, play it the way you want.

All the best cards are in the core set imo. So I don't think power creep has occured (Except for dwarfs).

 

Essentially the earliar stuff is too good.

Spirit Glorfindel, Light of Valinor and Asfaloth are in the best cards of the game and they aren't in core

 i agree with that- dwarrowdelf brought some of the best cards so far…especially for solo players
