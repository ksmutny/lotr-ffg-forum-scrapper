I know this has been asked way too many times, but I'm starting to sleeve my cards and have to find a different method of storing them. I usually leave them unsleeved (I know, terrible isn't it) and just stick them in a nice ultra pro clear box. But when I sleeve the cards they don't fit in the boxes any more. I know some people use binders, but that seems like a very time consuming process. Any suggestions?

I'm using BCW cardboard boxes. The entire LCG, sleeved,  just about still fits a four-lane one (I think that's sold as 5,400 cards capacity, unsleeved), but I've purchased a second one now that the card pool is growing further.

 

They're dirt cheap, although obviously paying a few quid for what is essentially a shoe box may seem excessive to some.

+1 for BCW

Here is my solution. I got to a point when I just couldn't fit everything into the core box anymore.

 

Plastic briefcase that looks like aluminium. The scenarios are to the left. The core set, Khazad-Dûm, Black Riders and the first two cycles are sleeved. Player cards are organised in deck boxes by colour. The green one for lore looks black in this photo. The brown one and the two boxes on the right hold player decks. Tokens are in a felt bag, threat trackers in the lid. Heroes and particularly cool ally cards are in the binder, sorted by sphere and names. Very pleased with this. I'm kind of an organisation freak. Thank you for sort of giving me an opportunity to show it off - almost no one here plays the game.

 

For the sake of being relevant to this thread: the ultra-pro deck boxes also hold sleeved cards!

There are mayday brand sleeves that barely cover the size of a card. They usually still fit into card boxes with those sleeves on. I've managed to keep mine stored that way.

I was wondering, I am not currently sleeving my cards but how necessary is that?  I am low on money so I can't afford to much but are should I get sleeves before I have a ton of cards or after?

## 8 [Catastrophic09 on October 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125467-storage-again/?do=findComment&comment=1308521)

I'm also curious about what sleeves you all use specifically. I've currently sleeved all my cards in Mayday Almost-a-Penny sleeves because they're cheap and I like the tight fit, I can't stand loose sleeves where my cards are moving around in them. But those sleeves are showing a lot of wear and scuffing on them and are also inconsistent with sizing, I've had 2 of 10 packs actually be too small to even fit the cards in! I'm considering switching to UltraPro Standard Pro-Fit sleeves.

 

So does anyone else use UltraPro's Pro-Fit, how is the fit and consistency??

 

As for the OP, I have a custom wooden insert that fits in my core set box, works amazing. I still keep encounter cards in their boxes and current decks I'm playing with I put in UltraPro boxes (same as Olorin93 showed) which are portable and convenient :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 9 [crx3800 on October 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125467-storage-again/?do=findComment&comment=1308851)

Ultra pro and dragon shields are the best for consistency. The Mayday sleeves are probably the best price to benefit ratio you can get for their cheap sleeves. I'd rather the sleeves take the beating than having to buy a new pack of cards.

## 10 [gandalfDK on October 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125467-storage-again/?do=findComment&comment=1308965)

I use FFG clear sleeves and I have sleeved all my cards, even the ones that I don't use anymore. The FFG sleeves are really hardy and (after using them two or three times) they play very nice, shuffle well and feel like I actually have cards in my hand. They are not that cheap so I'm thinking about removing the sleeves from the old encounter decks from the core set and all.

> I was wondering, I am not currently sleeving my cards but how necessary is that?  I am low on money so I can't afford to much but are should I get sleeves before I have a ton of cards or after?

I started sleeving, when I noticed, that Steward of Gondor was used so much, that I could start noticing in decks, when it might be next card. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Other than that, I like playing more with unsleeved cards, but I hope to play this game for several years, so sleeves are the only option.

## 12 [faith_star83 on October 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125467-storage-again/?do=findComment&comment=1310135)

Actually what I do to save money is keep all Player Cards in a Binder and just sleeve my decks. I rarely have more than three decks at once anyway. I don't sleeve (anymore) the Encounter Cards, because I don't use / shuffle them as often as I do the Player Cards.

This way involves some resleeving when I build decks, but given the small amount of time I find to play this game lately it is worth the money I save for sleeving everything.

I store decks and such in the Core-set box, and keep all the encounter cards in their respective Expansion box so they are easy to find. However, in the very near future I will buy a wooden box and get a bit crafty :-)

 

These are the sleeves I used and love...not sure they are available outside of Japan, though.

I've got everything sleeved. Started off with FFG clear sleeves but because their availability is iffy to say the least switched to Ultra-Pro clear sleeves. i now have all Quest cards and stand-alone encounter decks (i.e.the GenCon specials) in FFG sleeves ansd all other cards in Ultra-Pro.

 

Both good sleeves, the Ultra-Pro's are but have that icon on them which doesn't work for two-sided cards; it can also wear away on cards that are in heavy rotation.

## 14 [deeth82 on October 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125467-storage-again/?do=findComment&comment=1310362)

I've got everything from the Core set to Heirs of Numenor, and the AP's in-between.  I've also got the Voice of Isengard expansion, and the two Hobbit Saga expansions.  All sleeved, and in Ultra Pro 100+ deck boxes inside of a 20" metal toolbox.  I store the tokens in some To-Go Ware tins I had laying around.  In the beginning I used FF sleeves, but then the cost drove me to Mayday and Ultra-Pro, with Ultra-Pro winning out for bridging the price-to-quality gap the best.  Now all my cards have that silly reflective logo on the back, but it works out ok.

## 15 [ruferto on October 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125467-storage-again/?do=findComment&comment=1311288)

This is my collection:

 

- An album which contains one copy of every player card

- Box #1: Core and Shadows of Mirkwood, Dwarrowdelf and Against the Shadow cycles, completes (including deluxe expansions)

- Box #2: Ringmaker cycle (on the left), Nightmare and print on demand expansions (on the right)

- Box #3: Saga expansions

 

I sleeve using a colour code :

- Black: player cards

- Red: encounter card (Core and main cycles)

- Orange: heroes (Core and main cycles)

- Dark green: Print on demand expansions

- Yellow: The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill encounters

- Light Blue: On the Doorstep encounters. This is because each expansion needs a different Bilbo Bolson

- White: The Hobbit saga heroes

- Purple: LOTR saga encounters

- Light green: LOTR saga heroes

Hi,

 

I'm using the UltraPro Standard Pro-Fit sleeves on all my cards with "the Ring" backside. So Heroes, Player Cards, Mugash (and his friends) and a lot of boons, burdens. I don't sleeve the encounter cards because I just use a specific set too rarely to sleeve them. My storage goes into DragonShield boxes. 

5 boxes in total for now:

Box 1: Lore + Leadership
Box 2: Tactics + Spirit

Box 3: Core encounter + 1st cycle encounters + 2nd cycle encounters
Box 4: 3rd cycle encounters + 4th cycle encounters
Box 5: Nightmares + Boons/Burdens + Neutrals + Heroes + Fellowships + Quest Cards

All space that is left (because non of my cycles is complete (delivery on some old things tend to be pretty hard for my local game store)) is occupied by Saga expansions and the stand-alone packs.

Got 2 new saga expansions coming in, when that happens Ill probably put all my saga's into a 6th box and I need to rearrange some things. My main ideas for now are 2 cycles per box, saga's together, and organize the others in some way ....

I furthermore found myself dividers st I could find all the encounter sets pretty quickly which is pretty convenient.

And yes, the sleeved cards fit within the boxes.

How long are these boxe in length? About as long as a Core Box? And about the same height?

In other words, does one box fit into a Core Set box? (if you take the inner fitting out)

## 20 [Jban on October 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125467-storage-again/?do=findComment&comment=1311561)

Only bad thing about these boxes, the lit is just to wide to put them into the core box. But because the weight tends to be pretty high (so the core box might collapse) I just stack them within my own cupboard. The core box I use for all the rulebooks/sheets. All accesories of the game are mainly found at the top of my boxes so I find them together with my cards.

Next to that I'm pretty happy about it because they are easy to use, pretty sturdy, easily fit 2 cycles and fit sleeved cards. The dividers I use with them make it pretty nice, so never need to look for anything or use color codes.

Edit: Length of the boxes isn't any issue, but because the boxes are just to wide to close the box completely  (which would frustrate me ^^) I never thought about storing them inside.

One important thing to know before you start on the Ultra-Pro sleeves. They have a mark at the bottom om the sleeves, so if you mix with sleeves you should pay attention the marks are at the front side so you don't spoil any information. Because I only have the Ultra-Pro sleeves , I could put the mark at the backside so I don't cover any of the front side of these beautiful cards.

> OMG! Where can I buy such a box? I want that too!

I searched high and low for a good briefcase on Amazon and Ebay, but found nothing. Eventually I walked into a local hardware store here in southern Sweden and saw cases like this almost immediately. The little boxes are pretty commonplace - Ultra Pro, I think they're meant for MTG but they're perfect for sleeved LotR decks.

White (Players cards)

Clear (Quests cards)

Green (Core Set and Mirkwood Cycle)

Red (Khazad-Dum and Dwarowdelf Cycle)

Blue (Heirs Of Numenor, Against the shadow cycle and Voice Of Isengard)

Black (All Saga expnsions, GenCon scenarios)

It's not necessarily a "Plug and Play" solution since the box is designed for art supplies, so a little work needs to be done to accommodate cards.  But the dimensions are perfect for card storage once a little modification is done!

Wow, hard to compete with what borne to lose posted :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

My recommended solution is to get Magic: the Gathering Holiday Gift Boxes.

 

http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1364 [http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/arcana/1364]

 

Yes, they are made from cardboard. But they are really well done, with beautiful artwork, the boxes are sturdy and look nice on the shelves. And they come with quality plastic card dividers with classy fantasy landscape artwork.

 

To very conveniently box up all my sleeved cards (thick FFG sleeves) it takes 5 of the M:tG Holiday Gift Boxes, and there is still room for more (to give you perspective, I have all up to Nin-in-Eilph, including PoDs, just without the two last GenCon quests). 

 

There is one issue with the boxes. They come with four M:tG booster packs inside, so the price includes those boosters. Still, it is not that expensive when compared to what other storage solutions you can get. And I get a deal at my FLGS (which I am sure you can arrange for too at yours) that I get a huge discount but let them keep all the boosters. Or you could just sell the boosters, or share costs with someone who likes M:tG, and then net cost of the box would be very cheap.

 

As for sleeves, I put all my cards into FFG sleeves. 

 

http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS05 [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS05]

 

Theses sleeves have far lower wear & tear than anything else I tried. Plus they feel good in hand, shuffling is not a problem, and at the same time they are not too slippery.
