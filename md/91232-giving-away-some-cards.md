I have cards from two core sets to give away.

 

- The encounter decks from 2 core sets.

 

- Heroes from one core set.

 

- All the cards that are only once in the core set are missing.

- It lacks some cards that are twice in the core set.

- No Gandalfs.

 

- Tokens and threat counter of one core set are there. (still in the original cut sheet)

 

All comes in one core box or without it.

 

 

 

For the shipping costs I will send it anywhere.

 

I am from Austria.
