After two attempts at gencon and two more last fall in Pennsylvania my wife and I invited ten allies to our home to face the Siege of Annuminas: epic multiplayer mode.  The first game of the day ended in disaster when staging area a/b threated out due to location lock.  The second however ended in the narrowest of victories with the city only having 6hp remaining.  It really was epic and will go down as perhaps my favorite LotR lcg experience.

You have 10 friends nearby that all play LotR LCG? Consider me jealous!

Yeah, a bunch of us went to a place outside of Pittsburgh for last year's fellowship event.  As we introduced ourselves, we found out most of us came from northeast Ohio.  Before we left my wife got everyone's contact info.  The she arranged last night's get together.  She is a keeper.
