Let's say SOI is attached to my deck.  In the process of the current combat, Legolas defeats an enemy using Blade of Gondolin, and the current location, Mountains of Mirkwood, is explored.  The description of the effect in Mountains of Mirkwood indicates it is a Search effect.  Is it correct, then, to take the top 5 cards, select one to put in my hand, etc.?  That is, the Search effect does not interact with by the SOI Condition effect on the next time I *draw* cards, right?  By my reasoning, I think I get to Search and put a card in my hand, and the SOI remains attached until the next Resource phase (or other opportunity to *draw* cards).

 That's absolutely correct.
