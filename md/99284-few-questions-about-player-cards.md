Sorry, if I ask something that was discussed yet in other topic.

1. Forth Eorlingas! (morgul vale)- can those Rohan heroes attack together?

2. Fresh tracks (the long dark)- if I choose a "immune to player cards effects", does this card triggers its effects? 

3. Can I deal damage to "immune to player card effects" enemies via Gondorian Spearman or Spear of the Citadel?

4. I just want to be sure about this one. 
If some weapon- for example Dagger of Westernesse- is exhausted because of Goblin-Cleaver or something else, does it still adds its ATK and other boosts?

1. Yes

2. Can't use Fresh Tracks on an immune card

3. Can't deal damage to immune cards via any means other than standard attacks

4. weapon text is still active when the card is exhausted, so they still add their stat bonuses
