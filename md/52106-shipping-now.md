 Awesome!  That means it'll probably arrive at my local game store next week.  I've been really looking forward to this adventure pack since it's first preview earlier this year.

 I want the next one to hurry up now. It's most cost-effective for me to order two or more at a time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
