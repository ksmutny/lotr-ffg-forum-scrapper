# [YOUR campaign so far...](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/)

## 1 [Pharmboys2013 on October 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1302585)

With the release of The Road Darkens we now have 6 full quests and and a pretty wide array of boons and burdens for us to potentially earn and wanted to see the different experiences we as players are having as we continue to create our own unique journey. If you wish, follow my template.

Two-Handed Campaign
Deck 1: Gandalf - Elrond - Glorfindel (spirit)
Deck 2: Sam - Merry - Pippin

Shadow of the past
Boon: Mr. Underhill
Burden: The Ring Draws Them

Knife in the Dark
Boons: Noble Hero (deck 1) and Valiant Warrior (deck 2)

Flight to the Ford
Burden(s): Eaten Alive!

The Ring Goes South
Boons: Anduril & Glamdring (given to deck 1) Sting & Mithril Shirt (given to deck 2)
Burden: None (opted for 5 threat increase)

Journey in the Dark
Burdens: Grevious Wounds and Pursued by the Enemy
Balrog Defeated: Yes
Hero Sacrificed: Gandalf (returned to life with fortune or fate)

Breaking of the Fellowship
Boons: Phial of Galadriel (given to deck 1) Three Golden Hairs (given to deck 2)
Burden: Followed by night 
Seat of Seeing explored: Yes
Burden removed: Grevious Wounds
Prisoner(s): Glorfindel & Pippin


Pleasantly surprised by how much the different boons and burdens give an individual feel to the play through and I will be looking forward to this continuing with future saga expansions. I also hope for more tough player decisions in future saga quests like with how the balrog and defeating him was designed as well as the prisoner concept which we'll see developed in our next saga quest.

 

Edit: replayed breaking of the fellowship with the intent of making sure i cleared seat of seeing

What is the theorettical scenario in which you gain the least amount of burdens and the highest amount of boons so far?

Since I do not have TBR yet, I was just curious as I think I want to keep playing until I achieved that scenario.

## 9 [silverthorn on October 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1302860)

Probably The Ring Goes South, you're handed four (I think) boons straight away thanks to the Campaign Mode card.

## 10 [PsychoRocka on October 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1302869)

By placing enough damage on Old Man Willow and gaining Old Bogey Stories is really the only boon that is a bit harder to earn and not just instantly given. I guess playing the campaign four player allows you to obtain all four boons from A Knife in the Dark.... but at the same time would be a much harder campaign and if each player didn't get one some decks would automatically be a bit weaker than others. So really earning Old Bogey-Stories by doing plenty of damage to Old Man Willow (which is not easy! he raises threat every attack and hits hard and many times too) is the best possible situation for boons as all the others are automatically earned.

 

As for burdens you can earn none in Flight to the Ford with some trickery and if you defeat the Balrog you only have to take two from Journey In the Dark instead of four. Also you can avoid the treachery in The Ring Goes South as well as one of the ones from Breaking of the Fellowship. So yeah I think thats the best possible situation.

Only one burden from shadow from the past, two from journey in the dark and one from breaking of the fellowship is the best possible burden situation at this point.

Ooh nice catch on the seat of seeing location. Forgot about it since I don't think I've ran into it in a single one of my playthroughs of the scenario

> Ooh nice catch on the seat of seeing location. Forgot about it since I don't think I've ran into it in a single one of my playthroughs of the scenario

Yeah I got pretty luck seeing it the first time I got that far :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  I did get crushed on stage 1 twice though...

Mainly due to several copies of River Anduin appearing both times..... nasty nasty card.. especially when 2 or 3 stack over several turns! <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]

I also had The Ring Draws Them appear during stage 1 which very interestingly circumvented the skip the encounter phase effect of the quest stage card and allowed me to take out a few Uruks on stage 1 reducing threat in staging. I was also able to engage and take out another from Slopes of Amon Hens effect. I found that the toughness keyword can be pretty strong against certain tactics (Galadhon Archer did nothing and Haldirs effect was also drastically reduced, until stage 2 and 3 at least) and the best way to circumvent it is to merely bring enough attack power to the table to outright kill them, wounding them over multiple turns is not a good option.

All this rescuing of Gandalf with Fortune or Fate seems a little unfair to me. It diminishes the weight of his sacrifice!

Just thematically it's hitting me all wrong. Plus, you know they're going to have some way of resurrecting a fallen hero to represent that moment in Fangorn!

## 20 [ricedwlit on October 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1304085)

They can have a character named "Gandalf the White" - this could be either ally or objective.  Since the name is not the same all players could use this ally even if Gandalf was sacrificed to the Balrog.  Of course they'd need to put a condition the card stating something like "Cannot be in play at same time as any card name Gandalf".

I couldn't agree more. In retrospect, I think the designers should have made it impossible to bring back a sacrificed hero in this scenario with Fortune or Fate. I'm not hating on anyone who does this, by the way, I just wish it wouldn't have been an option.

An option is almost always better than lack of one. Those who want - will resurrect, those who don't - won't do it. What's the big problem?

Because in this case, an option isn't better. The ability to resurrect by simply playing a card takes away the meaning of that whole decision. Sure, I can choose not to do it, but sometimes taking away choice from players actually makes other choices more meaningful.

Says you. It's not "simply playing a card". It's devoting a deck space, drawing it, keeping it and spending buttload of resources on it while having a hell of a lot other things to worry about. I say, if players manage to bring hero that way back -0 they deserve it, and it's good we have that option in the game.

I agree that despite using fortune or fate myself during the playthrough it still felt like....i dont want to say cheating because its not...but it kind of felt like it was ruining the intent of the experience.  That being said, considering the large ramifications of having to add burdens or have dead heroes as the campaign grows from the 6 quests we have to eventually 18, i think it really inspires players to make the best decks and most powerful combos avaliable so as not to unnecessarily hamper themselves further down the campaign trail.  With only 6 quests for campaign right now the burden pool can already be pretty large if played recklessley and the potential threat increase of having dead heroes would really become annoying.  I think it says a lot that the most common decks listed for people's campaigns are ones that would be considered "top tier": Gandalf, Hobbits, Elrond, the twins...

 

Replayed breaking of the fellowship today because i wanted to explore seat of seeing and remove a burden from my pool. Failed the first attempt (this quest really gives me a hard time for some reason) and on the second I won and explored the seat of seeing, but had to burn my phial of galadriel since i had 5 enemies in play who all engaged at the start of stage 2A when they are assigned 0 encounter level.

I totally get it-- it's definitely more meaningful if you *can't* resurrect the hero.  I expected this, and was surprised when I was allowed to do it.  But I'm very happy that I didn't have to sacrifice a hero permanently, and could still minimize my burden proliferation.  I could have beaten the quest a lot more easily if I didn't have to pull off the Fortune or Fate play, so it definitely made the card more challenging to complete "successfully."

Haha love seeing someone actually saying the twins are top tier, I personally love them and think some people overlook how powerful they can be.

Good job redoing Breaking to succesfully explore the Seat of Seeing. What burden did you remove? Shame you had to use your phial but must have been very fun doing so!! Can't wait to use it to blind several enemies in play at once and counter attack with everything.

GrandSpleen, would you mind sharing your decklist with me/us? As I am also very focused on getting no boons, I love your style. But I can't seem to find secrecy work with my thematic decks..

I'm trying a new deck solo.

 

Heroes:

Denethor

Eowyn

Gimli

 

A Shadow Of The Past

Boon: Gildor Inglorion

Burden: The Ring Draws Them

## 31 [gandalfDK on October 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1305636)

Nevermind, I pulled it of myself.

Heroes:

Elrond

Gandalf

Glorfindel (sp)

A Shadow of the Past

Boons: Gildor Inglorion

Burden: Gandalf's Delay

There were only five cards left in the deck and thus I removed The Ring Draws Them. Not that it mattered, butmy new Gandalf deck was finally up and running and I even entered secrecy! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

@psychorocka I removed grevious wounds. I considered one of the treachery cards instead but they haven't been to much of an issue because they're a good target for original Frodo ringbearer's ability where as there's no way to get rid of the wounds until it's already attached. I have a decent amount of healing and 2 copies of miner of the iron hills but just didn't want the nuisance

Using phial of Galadriel was no doubt a game saving move but I was kinda disappointed I blew it so early. Got to be careful when using it too, most of the enemies had 4 atk so I took them undefended but shadow cards can still boost it so that they so damage and I think I ended up taking a point or two as damage but isn't a huge deal but it's not quite a thicket of spears save all

I do not really understand the rules of boons and burdens? When do I own them? When they remain in play at the end of the game?

## 35 [GrandSpleen on October 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1305908)

Each scenario has a Campaign Mode card.  This tells you any special instructions that you need to follow when you play that scenario as part of a campaign.  That includes the use of boons and burdens, and the campaign card will tell you when you have earned a boon or burden.

Hahah, since I was playing on OCTGN, I tried to flip the Campaign card, but it wouldn't work. So I thought: it has no back.. And I re the TftC playthrough and followed his steps on the bottom.. Thanks GrandSpleen!

> Just thematically it's hitting me all wrong. Plus, you know they're going to have some way of resurrecting a fallen hero to represent that moment in Fangorn!

 

You know, maybe the plan is to allow the players to earn a Boon, or avoid another Burden -- but only if they resurrect a hero whose name was added to the Fallen Heroes list in Journey in the Dark.

Now that would be a neat twist.  They could even make it an objective card that attaches to a hero and makes them an ally instead.

Why noble hero on Dain? He has to be ready for the bonus, so,he wouldn't usually quest, and he's a great defender.

## 44 [silverthorn on October 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1308499)

Mostly because I wanted to use Anduril on him for the bonuses and attacking after defending ability and it needs a Noble hero to use it, as well as the fact that a king of the dwarves doesn't get the Noble trait is a little confusing.

## 45 [PsychoRocka on October 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1308659)

Man Anduril, and Glamdring for quests that have orc enemies, are the absolute bomb. Anduril on Elrohir is ridiculously good.

On one of the saga quests (I think possibly Breaking of the Fellowship? But can't remember...) I had Gondorian Shield and Anduril attached to Elrohir as the two restricted attachments as well as steward and a dunedain warning. He was also receiving Arwens Buff every turn. This turned him into an 8 defense beast that could defend all attacks (or almost all attacks) for both players AND strike back with 3 attack power after one of his defenses every turn. So long as he was ready by the end of his defensive duties he could also attack a second time alongside other characters as well. If I had gotten an unexpected courage on him I would have used him to quest for 3 every round as well. Insanely insanely good.
 

Glamdring on Haldir (who already has Valiant Warrior in my campaign) turns him into 6 attack for two resources, slap a blade on him and he can take out any enemy with a combined defense and health of 8 before they even engage/attack with his ability. Also insane, plus if you're taking out any orcs you get to draw cards as well!! Sting seems GREAT, especially paired with Frodo from Road Darkens but I haven't really used it yet as I pretty much always quest with Frodo.... Need to keep him back for combat so I can actually try out his ability.

 

So yeah definitely don't overlook these attachments, although you only get x1 of them and they get shuffled into your deck rather than in your hand at the start they've very very powerful if put on the right hero and can also be fetched with anything that fetches attachments. Galadriel ally into a free Anduril or Glamdring would be EPIC value.

Shadow of the past

Score: 74

Burden: Followed by Night

Seat of Seeing used: Yes (removed Grevious Wound from my campaign pool)

Prisoner(s): Haldir and Legolas

I replayed most of the campaign quests in an attempt to get better scores and outcomes for my campaign pool. A few thoughts on my experience whilst doing so.
So far the hardest quest for me is definitely Journey in the Dark, I have not been able to replicate my single succesful victory where I also ressurected the sacrificed hero. It took several attempts to get that first win and I played the quest more times than it took for the first victory whilst on my quest to get better scores/outcomes and was just unable to beat it again.
Most of the Black Riders quests seem a fair bit easier now will all the new player cards from Road Darkens and the Ring Maker cycle but are still not a walk in the park and require good decks and strategy. I still find the first quest A Shadow of the Past, the hardest and find the other two much easier. Any difficulty decrease these three quests had in my games was balanced by the two new quests The Old Forest and Fog on the Barrow Downs. Both of these are challenging in their own ways and both very fun as well.

The Ring Goes South and Flight to the Ford are in my opinion the two easiest quests so far in the Saga and the second hardest after Journey in the Dark is probably The Old Forest or A Shadow of the Past.

I loved playing through The Road Darkens even more the second time (even with the 6 or more losses against Journey in the Dark) and got much better scores and outcomes for The Ring Goes South and Breaking of the Fellowship. Very excited for Treason of Saruman. Nervous to see how the whole prisoner mechanic works and how difficult the first quest will be without two of my precious heroes...

My favorite campaign (out of three I've run through so far) because it's the most thematically satisfying (at least in terms of big picture hero happenings).  The highlights: in Knife in the Dark, I defeated Bill Ferny by raising deck 2's threat like crazy (mostly with Fatty) until he engaged, then I dropped it back down with Aragorn.  Journey in the Dark worked out perfectly my first time through, as the Balrog came out at the very end of the game while my combat deck was first player and I laid a beat down on him, then discarded Gandalf with the Bridge the next turn as I quested to win.  After big G was gone, I subbed Merry in for Breaking of the Fellowship so that he and Pippin could become the captives.  That quest was iffy because the combat deck was the one that found Frodo, but a timely appearance by Gildor and Farmir sending his willpower boost across the table got me through. I seriously considered sacrificing Boromir to keep with theme, but enemies never bothered me that much and I couldn't bring myself to do it.  Also, I had a chance for Boromir to Fall Into Evil, but I chose Merry (then Elronded him back to my side) instead so that I wouldn't lose.

Campaign Pool:
Boons: Gildor, Skilled Healer and Phial on Sam, Valiant Warrior on Aragorn,  Three Golden Hairs on Boromir Deck1: Anduril, Mithril Shirt, Sting; Deck 2: Glamdring,

> Lore.  Sorry for not specifying that, the thought of there being another version of Pippin never crossed my mind. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Access to Spirit and threat reduction is pretty good on TRD quests, especially through Moria, but sure, Lore Pippen is much better in a vacuum.

Gandalf brought threat reduction to the Tactics deck with Galadrim's Greeting, and Black Riders Frodo offers cancellation, so I've found using a Spirit hero to be less crucial than it is in other scenarios.

## 54 [GrandSpleen on November 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343399)

While struggling with Journey in the Dark I went back and forth between Lore and Spirit Pippin several times.  The encounter deck just didn't give me much time to fish out a song, and I wanted cancellation and Power or Orthanc early.  In the end I won while using the Lore version, though.

## 55 [Bullroarer Took on November 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343425)

My struggle exactly. I feel that Pippen being the only spirit hero adds to the difficulty.

## 56 [GrandSpleen on November 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343429)

Also, the campaign card in Breaking of the Fellowship says that each player chooses a hero to be taken captive from among the heroes he controls.  Meaning Merry and Pippin need to be in different decks if you want them both to be chosen.

## 57 [Glowwyrm on November 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125065-your-campaign-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=1343491)

They were.  I stopped using the all-Hobbit deck at Ring Goes South, when I swapped Aragorn over to Sam-Pippin and ran a Gandalf-Boromir-Legolas Tactics deck.  After sacrificing Gandalf to defeat the Balrog, I swapped Merry into the Tactics deck so he could be the captive.

For condition removal, I used Sneak Attack plus Elrond (or straight up played Elrond).  Grievous Wound was an easy workaround with Warden of Healing etc. and I avoided Overcome by Grief long enough to have Elrond around to remove it.  Playing two handed (my prefered way to play) makes a big difference though, and I haven't been interested in trying them solo yet.
