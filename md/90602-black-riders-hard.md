# [Black Riders - Hard!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/)

For all you guys that are looking for some hard quests, these ones should satisfy you.  I have played the first two a bunch of times, and they can be quite brutal.  

 

There are conditions that cause you to either add a nasty enemy to the encounter deck or choose something like raising your threat a bunch/revealing another encounter card.  Lots of surges.  Just took Thorin and Co. to the Prancing Pony and had a turn 1 loss due to a Black Rider making multiple attacks.

 

I have been able to beat them a couple of times, but certainly more losses than wins, especially with a Hobbit deck.

All of the Black Riders cards are available for viewing over at LOTRLCG.  I hope to have my set by the end of the week.

 

Spurries, which heroes did you use?  I consider Spirit Pippen to be inferior to Lore Pippen, but he does give you access to some key Spirit cards.  I'm still building my deck virtually as I (cannot) wait.

I think my box will be arriving via mail while i'm away on a trip naturally. pure agony

I used Lore Pippin Merry, Sam.  Lore Pippin is wayyy better than Spirit, the +3 engagement is fine, but the card draw ability is awesome.  I do miss out on Threat reduction/shadow/treachery cancel is the only tough part, but Frodo can sort of cancel cards that come out if super nasty.

As an update, Thorin an Co. which can beat most quests, got decimated by this one my last 12 chances.  Maybe encounter deck was overly mean, but 12 is a decent sample size.

## 10 [Bullroarer Took on September 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=872267)

Maybe I got lucky or maybe I was doing something wrong, but I didn't find the quest that hard.  I used the deck the Boris posted in strategy.  Unseen Strike is a great card on this quest as it really helps drive off the Black Riders.

 

Edit:  I am only talking about the first quest at this point.  It's the only one I've tried.

@Took,

 

Ill give that deck a shot, but the dwarf power deck gets destroyed by the first quest on a regular basis.  I originally tried with a hobbit deck, but was a bit different than the one you referenced

## 12 [Bullroarer Took on September 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=872848)

Played quest 1 again this morning and beat it again handily. Just played quest 2 though and got slaughtered.

After playing through though I see a couple places where I made key mistakes. (Hail of Stones red courtesy phone..)

lucky dudes got BR already...... Actually is good time coming we will got last 2 packs of the third cycle +BR + VOI and N decks as well. 

## 14 [Bullroarer Took on September 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=872966)

Beat the second quest on my second try.  Hail of Stones was key and so is this:  Bill Ferney has got to die ASAP.

 

Even so it was really close.

## 15 [Glaurung on September 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873071)

Yes bill ferny must die asap. When i see him first time i tell my.self this guy must die or i lose. But he have 5 life Gandalf cannot shoot him.... hail of stone? Yes good idea.

## 16 [Spurries on September 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873126)

Yep Hail of Stones is great for that one.  I actually beat all 3 with a Spirit-Tactics deck that I love, I think someone on here posted it.  Eowyn, Beregond Glorfindel.  It only suffers a bit when the Witch King comes, as you need 2 WP to defend, so Beregond is out.

## 17 [Spurries on September 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873193)

Took you mind posting a recap of your quest 1?  Im using that deck and have a bunch of trouble with it.  Got to quest 3 once but failed Hide Tests hurt me.

Just got BR today. Slapped together a hobbit deck Merry, Sam, Pippen lore, and beat first scenario first attempt.u

The Hobbit cards are really powerful, Sam is really good, i hooked him up with 2 ring mail and a hobbit cloak, and he is good to go at 6 def. Merry with two blades of westernese is attacking for 8! Of cousrs most of this comes down to engaging enimes with higher engagment cost then your threat, but Pippen makes that possible most of the time. Fast hitch, obviosly rocks in this deck.

Elf stone was able to get Beorn and Gildor allies in basically for free.

Jeez maybe it was beginners luck, but the hobbits seem like they are really going to be able to hold their own on a number of quests.

As for the first scenario. I thought it was really well done, I don' think it's easy, but I would'nt say it's really hard. Although, these are only impressions after one play through.

Campaign mode seem interesting, and that's how i played it. I'll probably just stick with it now.

I guess I have trouble with the quests adding in Black Riders and performing Hide tests, with them attacking if you fail.  Mind posting a recap/details on the turns?  Maybe staying on the first stage as long as possible is best strategy?

I wouldn't mind, but I don't remember all of the details either.  Are you leaving the Riders in the staging area and not engaging them?  You have to kill them-

 

Oh no, you can't kill them!

 

Ok, you have to drive them off as soon as you can.  Save your Sneaky Gandalves for the 4 points of damage, engage, ready Sam, draw a card, play the Feint or Quick Strike you've saved (and maybe an Unseen Strike too if you don't have Gandalf) and send the Rider to the discard pile.

 

As far as Hide tests go, get a Fast Hitch on Sam and use him and Frodo to Hide.  Discard cards to the Protector of Lorien (that you've put on Frodo) or play Frodo's Initiative to make sure you don't fail.

 

I have a pretty busy week ahead and probably won't play again until next weekend.

After one play i did not really come up with a solid strategy. It seemed like readying is going to be really important to deal with the questing and any potential hide tests that came up. I was lucky to get 2 fast hitches early in the game. I put one on Sam and the other on Frodo. I would Quest with them and Pippin form7 and if a hide test came up, i would be able to ready Sam and Frodo for at 5 WP. Of course later i had some more questing power. The tactics event halfling Determination and Frodo's intuition cards were really great for a willpower boost. With the heroes i had Cram could also be useful. If you have a spirit hero. You have a lot mor readying options. I also used the Mr. Underhill Boon once and a couple of Feints on the Black Riders throughout the scenario.

I wish i could find a good way to include a spirit hero with these hobbits, but the 3 of them seem like such a good fit, i think it's going to be hard to split them up. I'm going to need to keep tweaking the hobbit deck, there are lot's of possibilities, and too many good cards to choose from.

I've never included it in a deck before because most of my decks until now haven't included a lot of allies to use.

 

Henceforth I'm calling the card Hail of Apple Cores.

Cool thanks , yea basically what Im doing, think ive been getting unlucky encounter deck, just actually beat it with a decent draw, but for your strategy of quick striking, what character do you have using that?  No one attacks for more than 4(Black Rider's defense) unless you attach the Daggers, which the deck you referenced doesnt include(although unseen strikes work fine here).

## 25 [Bullroarer Took on September 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873407)

I was using the deck I mentioned stock for the first quest.  (Sam, Pippin, Merry)  I added Hail of Apple Cores for the second.  Anyway, Merry attacks for 4, which takes care of the defense value.  Sam will ready and be attacking for 2 more.  If you have popped the rider for 4 on a Sneak Attack that will drive him off.  Or use Unseen Strike and another character.

## 26 [Tracker1 on September 24, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873788)

I finished off all 3 scenarios. These scenarios are really neat. I think they really capture the feel of the books quite well. I liked the second scenario the best. It seemed to have the most challenge.

I went with Merry, Sam and Pippin Lore (threat 20) with a real attachment heavy deck.

Here is the deck I used.

Allies: (8)

Gandalf core x2

Bill the Pony x2

Master of the Forge x3

Gildor Inglorion x1

Attachments: (25)

Hobbit cloak x3

Dunedain Warning x3

Dunedain Mark x3

Steward of Gondor x2

Celebrian's stone x2

Fast Hitch x3

Burning Brand x2

Dagger or Westernsse x3

Ring Mail x1

Gondorian Shield x1

Song of Wisdom x2

Events: (17)

Sneak Attack x3

Feint x3

Halfling Determination x3. Remove 1 and add Ranger Bow x1 after Sam gets Tireless Ranger Boon

Hail of Stones x2

Daeron's Ruins x3

Frodo's Intuition x3

Total 50

Sam with Dunedain Warnings, Ring Mails, Hobbit Cloak, SoWisdom/ Burning Brand, and at least one Fast hitch he becomes a brick wall. I had him at 9 defense on game, and if engagement cost does not work out he at 6 def. I have also added SoG and Gondorian Shield. All this and the Tireless ranger defense, Sam can safely defend for 11 when he is all primed up defending a higher engament cosy enemy.

Similarly with Merry. Two daggers and 3 Dunedain Marks, your looking at 11 attack, without engagement bonus he is at 9 atk.

Poor Pippin doesn't get anything, but his abilities are really what makes the deck work. The card draw is great too.

For questing it's pretty much Sam, Frodo, Pippin, and Merry when he gets a Fast Hitch. That's 9 WP. Sam with Celebrians stone and Bill the Pony bring that to a solid 12 each round.

These Hobbits really don't need much help from anyone else, as long as Gandalf shows up every once and awhile there all set.

I like your deck. It's my style for sure. I don't understand the bit about Gildor though. I thought you couldn't get Tireless Ranger until the end of the 3rd Quest? Or maybe you meant going forward?

## 28 [Tracker1 on September 24, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=873970)

I meant Gildor Lore ally, not the boon. I had one copy in my deck before I replaced it with Ranger Bow. You are able to select a boon like Tireless Ranger after completting the 2nd scenario, as it says on the Back of the Campaign card A Knife in the Dark.

The deck is fun, and to me it feels very thematic since most of the time you just have the 4 hobbits in play with Bill the Pony. Most of the other cards are meant to build up your heroes on the Journey. I'm really happy that I was able to take this approach, rather then having to call on heroes that don't at all make sense in the story. For fun, I'm going to run my Outlands deck through, I get the feeling they might actually struggle.

I just completed the first Black Riders quest last night and played two-handed solo.

The heroes I used were Merry, Fatty, and Glorfindel (Sp) for the first deck and Sam, Pippin, and Strider for the other.  It was definitely hard trimming down each deck to a playable size because there were so many cards I wanted to use (I really love all of the new cards.)  In the end, I ended up with about 55 cards per deck and decided just to go with it. 

 

It was a tense game, but for the most part I managed to stay under the radar of the Nazgul and quest high enough to escape the Shire and ferry across the Brandywine River.  A few cards that I found extremely helpful were Sword that was Broken placed on Aragorn, Fast Hitch and Hobbit Cloak placed on Sam, and Frodo's Intuition, the new (and only) Fellowship-sphere card of this expansion.

 

Also, I really like the idea of Campaign Mode and played with those rules last night as well.  The Gandalf's Delay burden didn't seem too horrible, and the Mr. Underhill attachment and surprise arrival of Gildor Inglorian from the encounter deck were awesome!

I completely agree that these are some of the most thematic quests we have so far and they are even more fun when you try to stay in those boundaries.  (Which is why I really wish we had an Aragorn Ally.)  I guess we could use Dunedain Wanderer...

Yes an Aragorn ally would have been great. That would have been perfect for the theme. I really thought we would be getting more of the Big name heroes as allies in these expansions. II am hoping to get all the characters as either heroes or allies from the fellowship for a solo deck, but that's probably just a pipe dream.

As for theme, the second scenario is great. You really feel like you are fighting for your life on top of Weathertop. I think they really nailed that scenario, each transition between quest cards is perfect in telling the story.

> Nice deck Tracker per usual. Just played the first scenario and Merry was swinging for 11 by the end of it haha. Sam was at 6 defense.

I tweaked the deck a bit.

I got rid of 2 healing herbs, added 2 Steward of Gondor. Also replaced 1 Ring Mail with 1 Gondorian Shield, all of which goes on Sam.

1 Gildor lore ally is back in, and when I get Tireless Ranger, take out 1 tactics event Halfling Determination it is either this or a Feint, and put in a Ranger Bow, although I just noticed it is restricted. I'll probably ditch it for Protector of Lorien instead. With Sam all decked out defending for a 11 with a burning brand the Feints are really only useful in the early game.

I'll edit the deck above

Anyway, this deck handles these 3 scenarios no problem.

I ran modified versions of this deck by removing Hobbits for other heroes, with marginal success and some loses.

I tried Sam, Merry, Glorfindel spirit. Lost second scenario

Also, Sam, Glorfindel, Aragorn lore Lost first Scenario twice.

hobbits are the way to go.

i tried this hobbit deck out on 7th level and they got smashed on the first few turns. They will get eaten up with low engagement enemies. Need to try again though.

Yea when I tried it I got rid of the herbs for Steward as well haha.  Shield is a good idea too.  I want to try one with Fatty next

I've played only normal mode, and have not tried easy, at this point I probably will not since what I consider a pretty thematic deck did just fine. I could take out Gandalf to be true to the book, then I might consider easy mode, so I guess it probably has it's place, but I'm not that hardcore on thematic deck making.

I've only tried normal mode.  I feel it has a nice degree of difficulty especially I you stay thematic.

Black Riders is difficult, but not in your face beat you to a pulp difficult like the HoN quests are.  The first two scenarios (all I've played so far) require a lot of strategic decision making, and they PUNISH poor choices and decks that aren't equipped to deal with their specific challenges (maybe I should underline that too, because there are very bad consequences).  I've only played them two handed, so I can't speak for their solo difficulty, but they required a lot of careful thought and some good luck to make it through.  And though we've all talked about using thematic decks against these scenarios, in this case,the thematic decks are strong decks.  I am anxious to try hobbits out against other scenarios to see where they really are as a deck type, but they are great against these scenarios.  And my other "thematic" deck is running Strider and Glorfindel, so I wouldn't call that a light weight either.  Overall, I like the scenarios a lot because they offer lots of strategic decision making that makes a big impact on the game.

I think that some typical powerhouse decks could struggle against these quests because there are some cards that really attack allies, so I can see why Thorin and Co. and Outlands could struggle as other posters have suggested.  I'll be interested to see what you think about them once you get them, Glaurung.

I tried my outlands deck on the first scenario. They smashed it as usual, but it felt wrong, i don't even want to try it on the other scenarios. Having 20 allies in play escorting Frodo out of the shire is not very thematic or fun at all. The second scenario might prove more difficult, but i don't really care, outlands have nothing to do with this part of the story, and basically the 4 hobbit heroes do well enough on their own.

My copy of The Black Riders has just turned up this afternoon. Luckily I have the day off, so I'm about to embark on these quests. After a brief glance, it looks like it's going to be epic.

## 44 [CaffeineAddict on September 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=876904)

I built up Tracker1's hobbit deck, and took on the quests. Won quest 1 on the first attempt, by successfully hiding from all the black riders. Felt very thematic, like the riders were breathing down your neck for the whole quest.

Quest 2, A Knife in the Dark, gave me more trouble. I've played it six times now - four of which I've managed to take out Bill Ferney on turn 1 or 2 with a Hail of Stones. I generally managed to stop additional Ringwraiths being shuffled into the deck, but kept being slaughtered on weathertop by the Witch King and the other Nazgul - in a couple of the games - in one game i was down to the last Nazgul, and got the treachery card that brings one back. I cancelled it with the one ring, shuffled and flipped up another copy.

Finally, though, on the sixth attempt, I managed to defeat all the Nazgul and win the quest. Ironically, this was the game where I didn't manage to dispatch Bill until about round 5. I wound up not travelling to the prancing pony for several rounds, building up a lot of attachments before advancing to stage 2, despite the increasing threat.

 

I haven't played quest 3 yet, but so far this expansion rocks.

Nice, I am surprised you had trouble with the riders at the end, especially if you took out Bill Ferney early on. Is your threat over 39 by that point? Remember Pippins's ability. Usually, I am able to take one rider at a time, and I usually start with the Witch king. By this point in the game you want to have Merry and Sam almost maxed out with attachments, and it's nice to have a feint and Mr. Underhill ready go. Also, there is nothing in the win conditions that says you need to travel to Weathetop, so don't at least when the riders show up. If you do you will get Slaughtered, after you exhaust the ring to travel there. You will have a lot of threat in the staging area next round, but I like to try and have a Gandalf sneak attack to help, hopefully Gildor lore ally is in play too. Frodo's Intuition can really help out to. It's best to use Gandalf to lower threat, but in a few games I have had to use him and a a hail of stones to take out Bill Ferney.

This is my favorite quest of the three. There seems to be a lot of strategic decisions to make. I like the Locations that help you out. There is one that puts a non-unique enemy under it when you travel there, that's the perfect location to have in play when the riders show up, since it will remove one of them from the staging area next round.

Awesome Quest.

I realised after the first couple of games that I had been forgetting pippin's engagement cost boost, so I had been engaging some of the spy enemies earlier than I needed to. When I said "on weathertop" I meant that part of the quest, once it comes into play, I didn't actually travel to it, as that does seem like suicide. I eventually beat the quest though - nice to have a quest thats both really thematic and difficult to beat.

 

I've played flight to the ford a couple of times now, and won both times. An decent quest, but I think on the whole I prefer the first two (with the Knife in the Dark being my favourite of the three).

 

Good job on the deck design, I've enjoyed playing it through these quests.

Let's talk Boons for a bit. After completing the second quest, A Knife in the Dark, players are entitled to take a Boon card and add it to their deck. The card doesn't count against the minimum, so you are running at least 51 cards. Here are the four Boons available:

Noble Hero, +1 WP

Valiant Warrior, +1 AT

Tireless Ranger, +1 DF

Skilled Healer, +2 HP

They all have zero cost, so it's well worth running 51 to get them. I listed them in my preferred order, but what do you think?

I gave Skilled Healer to Sam, as having him at 5 hit points permanently is pretty hard to pass up.

## 50 [CaffeineAddict on October 1, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=878801)

I gave Noble Hero to Sam, as I was using him as my primary quester. The others are all nice, but the attachment-heavy deck I was playing already beefed up the stats.

 

Not sure why it making 51 cards is relevant, though - they all have setup/permanent, so they're in play before you draw your hand, aren't they?

## 51 [Tracker1 on October 1, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=878856)

I gave Sam Tireless Ranger. I thought the defense early on would be good. I also liked the idea of the ranger trait, since there are other cards that interact well with it.

And these are permanent cards so they get attached at setup, so they don't really increase the size of the deck when you start to play.

## 52 [Bullroarer Took on October 1, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=879296)

Thanks for pointing out I get to attach them at setup. Not sure how I got that signal crossed. I can see why you want to be able to pick at enemies in the staging area with a Ranger Bow, but I too decided to get the WP boost.

## 53 [Bullroarer Took on October 2, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=880040)

I'm having a lot of trouble with Flight to the Ford. My current record is 1 win 3 losses. In those three losses what usually happens is a set of Surge cards early flooding the board and loading the Nazgul up with attachments. Maybe it's bad luck, but I think it's more likely a lack of good luck. Thread topic is correct. Quests 2 & 3 are hard.

Incidentally, all of the cards are up at www.cardgamedb.com, so our overseas fellowship members can take a look at what they've been missing. (And proxy up the quests if they so desire.)

OK got it and try yesterday with my friend. I like it. I cannot say is very difficult but is very ok. Really thematic is true.

Will try hobbits aragorn thematic deck and compagn mode as well. Sure will make some videos.

## 57 [Glaurung on October 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=882726)

Play solo. Win all quests with Aragorn lore, Bilbo, Glorifindel spirit. Quite interesting to play campaign mode. I play most hard way add burdens only. Boons I just ignore to make everything more difficult. In the end of my compaign I all burden cards in except one. Bad we need to wait for next box for some time.

I like BR is really good but is not too difficult so I spend only one night to past it.

Cannot wait for nightmare mirkwood cycle!

Don't forget that Mr. Witch-king is player card immune!  I messed this up myself on my first win against AKitD, and realized it a whole week later after we had already gone on and finished Flight to the Ford.  Now, how much do I want to go back and re-attempt that Weathertop confrontation...

Yesterday played with my wife the "shadow of the past" and "Knife in the Dark" both succesfully, yet again we had problem to win Shadow of the Past needing three attempts. On the other hand we went over Knife in the Dark pretty easily. 

 

After we win the Fight to the Ford we will try the campaign mode

I would believe it!

 

Played for the first time last night, (solo with all hobbit deck based on Tracker1's, rather cool, attachment heavy deck)... 4 Nazgul in the stage area by the 4th round - where a hide test was promptly failed... game two lasted three more rounds... before a horde of Black things on horses again found some exhausted hobbits (I think that I was incorrectly giving myself extra hide tests when Black riders were added in the Staging area or engaged me - just to make things more fun).  

 

Won the third game... this is favorite adventure/quest/theme/everything lotr lcg currently!!

Actually the first quests Is really hard compare to others....

second quest have a trick: doesn't matter what dont shuffle rhe nazguls and you will be fine.

And the last quest is not problem at all.

for solo BR is quite easy if you have a good deck and now how to play it. But is only start..... you get a burdens and maybe some heroes will die and there is a long way to Mordor. I love compaign idea just we need the second box to see the really value of compaign rules.....

The BR box set is hands down the best LotR LCG product released to date, in my opinion. It's quite possibly one of the best expansion products ever put out for any game.

> Only thing I can think of is the name of the box... The Road Darkens, I think?

Yes, I remember reading that somewhere as well.  Not much in the way of other information has been released for it yet.  I find myself wondering what new heroes will come with this next saga box that covers the 2nd half of Fellowship.  We already have two Aragorn's and two Boromir's, so I do find it unlikely to get a third of either one before we get a 2nd of another hero such as Gimli or Legolas. 

## 69 [Bullroarer Took on November 26, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=917011)

Allies. We need ally versions of the Fellowship members. (Sans Gandalf.)

## 70 [Tracker1 on November 26, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90602-black-riders-hard/?do=findComment&comment=917058)

> Allies. We need ally versions of the Fellowship members. (Sans Gandalf.)

I second that. Ally versions of some heroes would be great, but i think it is unlikely we will get many if any. It would satisfy the solo deck builder to get all fellowship members into one deck, but I think the designers lean more towards synergies between 2 or more decks, so assuming we can have 2 decks with 6 of the fellowship heroes already +Gandalf ally, and the set will probably also come with another Frodo hero, so between 2 decks you get 8 characters from the Fellowship. Which means we might see at least one member of the fellowship become an ally.

I think we also have to consider that these boxes are designed for a player to only have the Core set and probably BR. So with those sets we already have all hobbits asuming frodo will be objective hero again. We also have Leogolas, Gimili, and Aragorn from the core as well as Gandalf ally. The only missing member is Boromir, so it is possible we will see him again as either ally or hero. Ally would be cool, but I would not be so happy to see him as a hero again.

finally got around to getting black riders... I have to say that while I do not think it is overly hard the box is extremely good. I think it adds some really cool new player cards and opens a bunch of new decks as well as making some fun thematic decks actually viable for more hardcore players.

 

I would rate this as one of the better expansions and easily the best saga expansion.
