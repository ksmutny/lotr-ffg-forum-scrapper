Now that I have swept through Hunt for Gollum.  What is a good deck for Conflict at Carrock. 

Since Frodo Baggins was the new hero, is there any good deck that would utilize him?

Happy New Years BTW.

happy new year

 

carrock - defintaly a tatics game in my opinion, no questing really, however you need low cost heros, lowest you can go, so that the 4 trolls which which will wreck havoc if they all engage at once, can sit in the staging area until you have enough cards in play to take em down one by one.

carrock is basically a slow build up of resources and allies until the fight with the trolls happens, then it goes pretty quickly

as for frodo, yes he's good as he can cancel deadly attacks and add as threat, but to be honest your threat going up quickly isnt something you want in this quest so given that frodo is spirit i would say you want some galahdrims greetings and gandalfs and get that threat down quickly then you can add cards at leisure and still use frodos ability, also with spirit you can cancel SACKED! cards which can destroy your chances of winning

 

i think you want alot of buff cards- i.e. dwarven axe/ gondolin blade/ dunadain attatchments that give +1 attack and defense (dunedain mark and signal) give them to gimli and get unexpected courage on him and youve got yourself a tank, the downside to this is that would mean you having a leadership/tactics deck which will put your threat sky high to begin with.......

 

carrock can be either incredibly easy or incredibly hard, depending on your card draw, so its a bit of a 50/50 with me

so to sum up i would say - low cost heros, cards to increase stats, plenty of allies, threat reduction, and treachery cancelling, so......maybe Tactic/Spirit with elanor to cancel when revealed, gimli as tank, and im not sure about the other, you dont particularly need alot of questing here, so im thinking another tactics hero

I played today with Gimli, Denethor, and Elanor and got completely demolished.  Here are some problems I ran into.

Once the Trolls are in the staging area, threat will spike to above the 34 point

Trolls are very tough and get buffed by each other and the Carrock

I was able to use a forest trap on one of them.

Overall, they beat me to paste in short order.  Even Gimli was unable to do much damage to them.  I am open to suggestions to win since I have heard many people say this is actually a very easy scenario.

the only way i have ever won against this quest was taking the trolls down one by one, if they all engage you its pretty much game over, so that said my tactic is threat reduction. everything to keep threat low

- low cost heros, galdhrims greeting, gandalfs (sneak attack if possible so you can use again)

 

doing this i can get my threat incredibly low (and i mean well below 20) then i use a spirit deck to give me alot of questing power to ensure that it goes up no more than the 1 point in the refresh phase....doing this should ensure you plenty of time before they can engage and keep the threat down at the same time...

thats my strategy, but im sure there are others, as you can see its rather obvious weakness is needing a good start hand but remember you can always take a mulligan, an option alot of players forget about

Try Theodred - Eowyn - Legolas. Or Theodred - Eowyn - Gimli.

Generally speaking, this is very easy scenario for solo player if you use turtle strategy. Some cards can be very nasty like early sacked or early snake when you have noone to defend.  But even if they come into play, you can still win. I won game when sacked was encountered in first turn and another game when it came in second turn. Still, sacked is the most feared card and can make you lose a game easily (especially if there is a single sacked in early game or double sacked in middle game).

Anyway, a few tips:

- slowly build an army, enemy encounter deck is sending just 1 card against you each turn and you should be able to control the game during stage 1B. There are only few sacked cards in deck so you should not be drawing them frequently.

- do NOT flip to stage 2B before you are ready. In other words, do not overcommit characters to quest. Usually Eowyn + Theodred is enough. And remember that Legolas ability is optional.

- wait for Grimbeorn and buy him. Statistically you have much higher chances of finding Grimbeorn before you get sacked.

- remember that there are virtually no nasty shadow effects that can hurt you, this makes blocking / leaving attacks undefended much easier

- remember that some enemy cards are helping you . Despair is a real winner here. Same for misty mountains goblins. You can even leave them in play so they can attack you each turn while you block them efficiently. As an effect, they help you control progress during stage 1B,.

- the worst thing about sacked card is that it limits your resources. Use cards that help you with that like Theodred/Steward/Radagast. If tactic hero gets sacked while Radagast is in play, you can still play a lot of eagles and many tactic cards are not blocked. Remember that if hero gets sacked, you can use resources which ALREADY are available on him. So if you have 15 resources accumulated on theodred thanks to steward of gondor, you can choose to sack him when sacked is encountered. Theodred will not get any new resources, but existing amount of resources should be more than enough for the entire game. If you play Lore, you may consider using Iron Hill Miner (dwarf, cost 2, can remove attachment from hero when it comes into play). Another way to "unsack" a hero is to play Landroval and get the hero killed, so hero will return to play and be free! (and you can even sneak attack landroval). I used this once or twice when I was playtesting Landroval usefulness.

- when you have your army ready (a lot of allies and grimbeorn in play), you have several possibilities:

a) lower your threat to 33 or less and flip to stage 2B. All trolls go into play but they do not engage you automatically. Instead, you choose to encounter Louise and kill him in first turn. Your threat goes to 36 and 37 in next turn when all remaining 3 trolls engage you. Then you kill the trolls in 2 maybe 3 turns , but they are easy to defeat , you can block with grimbeorn or lose some cannon fodder.

b) lower your threat to less than 30 . 20-25 sounds really ok, but even 30 may be enough. Engage trolls 1 each turn and make sure that you commit enough characters to quest so threat does not go up. This way you can be killing trolls while they are isolated. Save Louise to be the last troll. This is a little bit risky strategy if you have no ability to counter frightened beast (eagles are your friend in this quest) and you need quite a lot of allies in play (so you can both quest and attack efficiently).

c) optionally, if you use elfhelm and have a lot of firepower, you may risk fighting with 4 trolls in the same turn. For example you have 36 threat and all trolls attack you. You get + 8 threat (elfhelm gives you -4), you kill Louise at first possible moment. At the end of turn you have 2 or 3 trolls still standing and 45 threat, so you still have a couple of turns to finish the job before threat goes up to 50. You can use feints instead of elfhelm.

excellent points above, and to help that strategy use longbeard map maker, then you can control how much willpower you commit to a quest not going over 1b before you're ready

## 9 [guciomir on January 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58282-good-solo-deck-for-conflict-at-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=573815)

Yeah, long beard map maker is really nice to control the progress if you have steward of gondor engine running. It is quite efficient if you play Dain + Bifur + 3rd dwarf deck as Bifur helps you to manage resources. (I know that Khazad is still not released, but since Bifur has been already previewed, I made a proxy for playtesting, used Frodo for this because of the similar stats)

Also, Faramir is rather easy card to help you manage quest progress . Wait until you see new encounter card, and either use Faramir ability, or not. Or instead of Faramir, you can use Henamarth Riversong and just take a look at the encounter card and then decide who should go questing.

I play it with spirit/leadership and is very easy to beat that scenario...just gather your forces in the stage 1, and enter to the second one with lower threath

## 11 [peterstepon on January 11, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58282-good-solo-deck-for-conflict-at-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=578291)

I tried to play this with a tactics deck and a lore deck (both mono decks).  I was hoping that my tactics would amass an army and my lore would get enough cards and forest traps to engage the trolls.  At least that was the theory.  I tried to play that way and my threat level skyrockeded and I was not making any progress on my quests.

 

Back to the drawing board.

 

Any ideas how we can win Conflict at Carrock with 2 decks???

If I remember correctly, we won it using mono Tactics and mono Leadership decks. This was the first game in which Thicket of Spears saved our bacon - twice!

I go a very different way here as i like control decks. I think tactics is a terrible way to go against this quest, as at this time tactics is very weak... it has a few aps to go b4 it comes into its own as a usable sphere imo. I think that at the time carrock came out tactics was extremely weak and best avoided.

You can easily get though this quest using a spirit lore deck.. card draw engine running off Bilbo and using dunhere to attack directly into the staging area. Then use a leadership splash for steward and marks. Mark came into the game at this time so you can get your marks on dunhere and attack for 6 into the staging area.. you have card draw off Bilbo instead of beravor, so use UC on dunhere.. keep your threat low with sneak attack gandalfs and greetings and tomb+greeting... then you can use UC to get dunhere to attack multiple times into the staging area.. killing off the trolls and other mobs with out feeling any pressure. Use Minstrels to hit your song splash (+2 quest power is awesome) and so on..

How many copies of core do you run. Also from your question about frodo you sound like you may be playing in order.. dose this mean you are using a restricted card list? Restricted means you are only using cards that were released at the time the Ap was released.. so in this case core+HFG+CatC?

I really love this quest and have played it a lot with different decks and can post some when i know your restrictions. I even have a deck made from a single copy of core + the 2 aps that owns it.. so card pool shouldn't be a problem

I guess your viewpoint is heavily influenced by your single player experience.

For two or more players it's extremely beneficial if one of the players is playing Tactics. This one player can concentrate on getting rid of all enemies, while the other player(s) deal with the questing and supporting the Tactics player.

Well the title of the thread IS - Good SOLO deck for Conflict at Carrock .. also ontop of that the player is playing RESTRICTED so he only has core+HFG+Carrock to play with, and tactics was undeniably weak back then.

I am open to any ideas on the table at this point.  I saw a video of a guy winning Conflict at the Carrock on youtube using Bilbo, Frodo, and Dunhere.  It was amazing to see how he did it. 

I think that the game might be pretty scaled for the number of players used.  At first glance, having more decks means fewer trolls per deck to fight.  But when everyone gets beaten to paste the number of decks becomes meaningless.  Having a mono deck keep it`s threat low and stealth into the fight and pick off trolls one by one might be a clever way to use a single deck.

what jhaelen was saying about 2+ player games is totlly true. I also think the best course is to split the decks into roles, and a quest / combat deck works great in 2 player.

I can selfishly recommend this thread:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/724924/as-low-as-it-gets-building-a-scenario-specific-so [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/724924/as-low-as-it-gets-building-a-scenario-specific-so]

 

In this thread you can find three things:

1. A dissection of Conflict at the Carrock, which should help you build a good deck in general

2. A deck that I have built specially against that scenario. You might be missing some cards, but I think it is only a small margin.

3. A session report

 

Maybe this is helpful to you.

 

For 2 decks, I can recommend:

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/662483/hammer-and-anvil-a-strategy-template-for-two-playe [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/662483/hammer-and-anvil-a-strategy-template-for-two-playe]

 

There you can find a strategy template for two complementing decks, maybe you even want to use some sort of deck from the first threat as a new Anvil for the Carrock.

Good luck.

wow, interesting deck.. i wish this entire forum would just mobe to BGG btw... anyway.. I'm going to give this a shot as it is like the exact oposite of how my deck runs.. the scroe is a litle high, due to the weak mshowing for spirit... but still looks like a real solid plan. I love the way you break down the quest... good bad ugle trecheries for example.. THIS is the real key in that thread.. it is encounter deck breakdown that enables you to win imo... either way looks fun! I Do think Gloin / plate / self preservation is one of the best resource engines in the game, even better than steward in some ways. Add some songs and you can pay for any card every turn.. as ur running tactics mocking makes it even better.. I think people think og gimli to fast when thinking of double plate.

cool stuff

I included a Song of Travel in later versions, which makes Gloin all the more awesome...

And I guess concerning the score, I made some wrong assumptions. Now playing in juicebox's tournament, I see people playing more "reckless" decks, only needing to win 1 out of 10 games (and maybe even playing more) with a stellar score. That deck was built with the "vision" of a "real" tournament where you better not lose a game. And that deck probably wins 10 out of 10 times against Carrock with a solid score (I have not played 10 games, but didn't lose one).

Hope that clarifies and glad you like it.

I'll post my deck, but there is probably a better combo (i'm only using cards from core, HFG, and C@TC)

 

Spirit/Leadship

Theodred, Eowyn, Dunhere

A test of will 2

The Galafhrim's Greeting 2

Ever Vigilant 2

A light in the dark 2

Gandalf 2

Mustering the Rohirrim 3

Eomund 2

Lorien Guide 3

Sneak Attack 2

Snowbourn Scout 3

Steward if gondor 2

The favor of the Lady 2

For Gondor! 2

Celebrian's stone

Northern Tracker 1

Unexpected Courage

Westfold Horse Breaker 3

Song of Kings 3

Dwarven Tomb

Faramir 2

Hasty stroke 2

Valient Sacrafice 2

Fortune or Fate

Dunedain Mark 3

I believe this deck could easily get you a negative score with cards from the other sets. I got a 24 score, and felt like i could have dragged the game out longer to drop my score lower, with fairly little risk to victory. I see a lot of suggestings on tactics deck... but i think it would be too hard to keep your threat down... and even the best tactics deck is going to buckle if all 4 trolls engage.

With this deck, the trick is to keep your threat as low as possible. The sneak attack gandalfs and Greetings help to do this. I am sure there is some sort of alteration of this deck that could get card draw... that would probably be ideal.

So you keep your threat super low. This deck is also a good quester due to to eowyn and various allies. In 2B, questing is vital... the threat is already 8, + what ever you are unlucky enough to draw. One of the lands can easy add an extra 6... so, you will be needing 12+ will power in this part of the quest...

Then theres the trolls. I did this by damage boosting dunhere. Since my threat stays as far bellow 34 as I can get it, i use him to slowly widdle down the trolls. In my second victory, i used the gandalfs for direct damage with dunhere to kill one of the trolls... my threat was lower than starting, and i felt confident enough to go with the damage. If you have grimbeorn and enough allies out  When a troll is low enough of if you can get a combind 12 attack, engange, and then gang up on him. Sacraficing eomund comes in handy here if you want to risk it without grimbeorn. Basically, it takes a little longer, but if you can fly under the radar with that low threat, and widdle down the trolls, you can eventually win. Best of luck

Yes!  I tried a variant of this deck and I found the mission a cakewalk.  Thanks so much for the idea!  I did not have 2 core sets or some of the other decks so I improvsed with some Dunedain marks cards to buff my heroes ( Just out of curiosity, can you put more than one of the same attachment on a character?  I was not sure but the book does not say anything on the matter).  Sneak attack with Gandolf is great for keeping threat low and/or attacking a troll.  Having the big giant join you and putting self preservation on him makes him practically invincible against the trolls.  Just fighting one troll at a time makes this scenario very easy, once you have enough allies and attachments in play.  Forest snare makes catching trolls easy if you don't want to spend time calculating how much damage to do to kill a troll.

I heard some say that this scenario can be as easy as Passage through Mirkwood.  I was sceptical, but now I see why.

Actually this deck can win against almost all quests quite well(KD quests as well). But Anduin (core set) and RTM is almost impossible to win.

I do not like that deck much personally. Glorfindel is a terrible choice imo for a hero for a solo player.. his threat is off the chart insane, his ability of healing is pretty average considering other healing options and his attack / quest power? Who cares.. as you are most likely only using him for questing anyway. I just think he is a really terrible choice. Apart form that I think the deck is pretty good, a very standard deck, prob one that mops people have build at some point, the only thing is that it has little outs for surprise moments. This is teh kind of deck that you quit mid game after some ravaging encounter card, as there was nothing the deck could do to stop it.

i have to agree here, glorfindel is too expensive for his ability, and i think his use will decrease more given the new secrecy keyword

Who cares.. as you are most likely only using him for questing anyway. I just think he is a really terrible choice. Apart form that I think the deck is pretty good, a very standard deck, prob one that mops people have build at some point, the only thing is that it has little outs for surprise moments. This is teh kind of deck that you quit mid game after some ravaging encounter card, as there was nothing the deck could do to stop it.



Yes i also think same about Glorfindel before. He is expensive. But then i start to use him more and more and i find him quite good. With UC he is for quest and for the kill. Actually this deck strategy based a lot on Glorifindel. He have SOG +all songs and 2 UC. Bilbo and Frodo equip with Boots, Protector, FH and BB on Bilbo. Then your heroes can quest, defend and attack. +Gildor and Haldir helps a lot. I didn put Zigil miner or Tracker cose is to powerful and broken all idea of the game(as i say before never use Beravur, Trackers or Will of the west..... now i think i add Zigil Miner too).

In My logic i always build up decks for play whole game. Not against a certain quests! Is boring for me cose if you build up deck special against certain quest you will have so big advantage so you will win for sure. Glorifindel in this case really important hero for his a good status  he can quest good , attack strong and also his healing ability very useful( special with Bilbo cose he is really fragile).In different quest you use him different. But he is really solid hero and can be use for many purpose. I didn like dwarfs to much anyway! Actually i didn like them at all.......

And my solo scores with this deck is the best for now!!!

Yes sure why not build up different decks all the time. There is a many options.

Anyway i wait for the tournaments system. And then i will builid up my deck according system.

I use to play card games for many years. This is third Lotr card game for me. I use to play Lotr tcg from decipher as a sport 10 years before. Was number 1 in my country and also play a worldcup. So i really wait and hope for the good tournament system for this game.

What is this "tournament system" you talk about?

Also, where do you live?

 FFG has mentioned that they would like to have some sort of official organized play system in place.  The last we heard, it was in the works.  I believe that is what Glaurung is referring to.

Yes i mean that. When i start to play this game(since May 2011) i read some article where designers explain about tournament system for this game. There will be tournament system for 2 player game. Players come to play and declare them self as a team. Maybe there will be some special tournaments pack or some..... They was not sure about this....... But there is rules: deck should be 50 cards minimum and no more then 3 copies of the same cards and 2 players as a team. The

From the begin game has awful balance for now is much better with all erratas and some rules changes . KD bring game to whole another level. In my opinion this is right way. So maybe soon is time to invite the TS. Or maybe after second cycle?

That sounds very nice, but is already very similar to what I do (and probably most others) when trying a championship with friends.

They announced that before the first cycle was out? Is there any update so far?

 

Also, on an unrelated note, do anyone knows when the Dwarrowdelf cycle starts? I know it is January, but when? Do they have an exact day to release expansions (i.e. like with previous expansions)?

 Can't you only use 1 Gandalf per deck?

 You can use up to 3 copies of any card in your deck.  Gandalf (and Faramir, and Celebrian's Stone, and Landroval, etc.) is unique, so the restriction is that you can only have one copy of Gandalf in play at any time.

Only if you use those premade mono decks from the coreset. That's because they include only 29 cards, thus having 3 Gandalf's is too much (but no one would stop you doing that anyway gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]). If you start building "real" decks, you will have 50+ cards which can include up to 3 copies of Gandalf and any other existing card, like radiskull said.

 Ok. Yeah i'm way past the core set starters. I just thought in the rules it meant you can only use one per deck. Thanks for the clerification guys. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I 've played several games of Conflict with the following deck on various minor variations and, every single time save the first where I made a terrible mistake and was extremely unlucky at the exact same instance and lost, I finish it with a negative score. I own a single CS, THfG and CatC:

Heroes:

Eowyn

Frodo Baggins

Beravor

Allies (20):

Lorien Guide [3]

Northern Tracker [2]

Wandering Took [2]

Daughter of the Nimrodel [3]

Gleowine [2]

Rivendell Minstrel [3]

Faramir [2]

Gandalf [3]

Events (22):

A Light in the Dark [2]

A Test of Will [2]

Dwarven Tomb

Hasty Stroke [2]

Stand and Fight [3]

Strength of Will [2]

The Galadhrim's Greeting [2]

Will of the West [2]

Radagast's Cunning [2]

Secret Paths [2]

Sneak Attack [2]

Attachments (8):

Unexpected Courage

Protector of Lorien [2]

Steward of Gondor [2]

Song of Kings [3]

I believe this version to be the definite one.

There is no such thing as a negative score. 0 is the best you can get.

How did you manage to kill the trolls?

How many rounds did it take you?

How did you lower your threat?

I believe you can get a negative score if your threat + rounds score is lower than your VP total.  Highly unlikely, but possible, I think.  You can't have negative threat though.

Yeah, sorry. Did confuse that. 

Ah, I guess Serazu is playing the old scoring system. Right. Shouldn't  FFG start printing new rulebooks.

1. With Beravor + Unexpected Courage and Gleowine I have godly draw. Before long I have amassed my whole deck in my hand.

2. With 2 copies of Will of the West I manage to play again and again and again Gandalf and my events.

3. Gandalf + Sneak Attack + Galadhrim's Greeting + Will of the West and my threat sinks to very low numbers, even zero.

4. With such a low threat I pick the trolls one by one and destroy them.

5. Did the scoring system change? Where can I find the new ruling?

Serazu you are playing old score breaking strategy. Now it is no valid anymore because the scoring changed. You add 10 points for every finished round (check FAQ). This was a brilliant move from FFG because many players were stalling the game and bringing threat to 0 (which sometimes was taking VERY long time).

Yeah, I was one myself I have to admit. Smart move. I 'll look into the FAQ.

The fact remains of course: the deck I posted works like a charm vs. Carrock.

I just beat it using a mono-spirit deck. 

 

Use the following

Frodo Baggins 1

Dunhere 1

Glorfindel 1

 

Arwen Undomiel 2

Kili 3

Northern Tracker 3

Pelargir Shipwright 3

Fili 1

Vassal of the Windlord 2

Gandalf 2  (OHAUH)

Defender of Rammas 2

The Riddermark's Finest 2

West Road Traveller 1

 

Ancient Mathom 3

Light of Valinor 3

Song of Battle 3

Spear of the Mark 1

Rivendell Blade 2

Dagger of Westernesse 2

Unexpected Courage 2

 

A Test of Will 3

Elrond's Counsel 3

Hasty Stroke 3

Resourceful 3

Unseen Strike 2

 

Since threat is so low you can keep trolls in staging area and snipe with Dunhere when loaded and drop gandalf into play.
