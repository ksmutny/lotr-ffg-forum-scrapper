A reshuffle question has prompted my own reshuffle question! 

In the rules under Victory X it says that these cards are placed by your threat dial, rather than the discard pile - so do you not reshuffle these cards if you get through the Event Deck?

Leave the cards with victory points out. I have never in any of my games run through the entire encounter deck, been close once in scenario 2 but beat it before that happened so it is not much of an issue.

 The enemies and locations that grant you victory points are not shuffled back in the encounter deck (the encounter deck depletes quickly with several players). You keep them close to you until the game ends.
