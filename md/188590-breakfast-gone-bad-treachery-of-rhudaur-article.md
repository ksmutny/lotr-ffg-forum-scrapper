The second breakfast article for Treachery of Rhudaur is up! Not a single encounter spoiler but a cool read nonetheless! Very excited for this AP!

That is some amazing art. This could be my favorite pack art-wise so far, although I suspect the 2 last ones are gonna be really awesome.

Agreed, that art is fantastic. I really like what they seem to have done with this scenario and how they tie this new adventure into Tolkien's existing lore on the kingdoms of Arnor. This is shaping up to be my favourite cycle so far!

Is it me or the art is always getting better? I can,t wait to see the AP player cards... although the new Noldor Lore hero with all the drawing and discarding... is most intriguing....

I love it when we get spooky themed APs close to Halloween! I remember we got Dead Marshes back in the day around Halloween and Stone of Erech as well. Anything to enhance my experience of Autumn and all it's glory.

Looks like it will be a really great quest!  I have a special appreciation for the quests that are in dungeons, ruins and cities...I really love that they've found so many interesting ways to do scenarios in such varied environments.  Plots in Steward's Fear, saving villagers in Amon Din, rescuing allys and finding gear in Mt. Gram, clues in Treachery of Rhudaur, using a torch in Moria... all such neat mechanics in cool environments.  

 

Also, that bit about the hawk symbol recurring throughout the art is a pretty awesome way to really marry up the lore/story with the art.

I wonder what those clues will actually be and what will they mean to the scenario. The fact that they didn't show a single card makes me all the more intrigued.

I quite enjoyed this part of the article, myself:

 

At times, the developers of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/] pause amid their endless march toward the fires of Mount Doom.

 

Go, go Saga Box development!
