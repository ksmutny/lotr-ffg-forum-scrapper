# [OCTGN Unofficial Set - Thugs to the Rescue](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100494-octgn-unofficial-set-thugs-to-the-rescue/)

## 1 [MyNeighbourTrololo on March 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100494-octgn-unofficial-set-thugs-to-the-rescue/?do=findComment&comment=1001783)

Good day, good sirs! I'm proud to present you an OCTGN exclusive "Thugs to the Rescue" custom player card set, featuring new Thug character trait and Mischief event trait and their full support all-around with some stuff for outside of trait machinations and synergies. This set contains 10 new heroes, 20 new allies, 10 new attachments and 14 new events to boost your options in a fight against the Dark Lord. 

 

Promotional stuff aside, this was inspired by a "Creative Artwork Cards" thread from the FFG forums, when I did a few thugy allies for the sake of it and I started to get ideas one after one until they overwhelmed me and this "expansion" was a result. Here's the pictures:

I'll be honored if you'll check it out. I'll be even more honored if you'll install it and give it a spin. And I'll be happiest person in the world if you would leave any comments and/or suggestions about it, regardless of what it is: unfitting art, balance problems, misspelling or bad wording and etc.

 

Here is the set iself:

Wow! You must have put a lot of work into this. Nice job!

Why yes, I had. Thank you. Took me plenty of time.

Hi

looks good, i totally love "lust of wealth" cant wait to put it on Thranduil:) But sholdent it be resouces instead of cards that trigger it with Beravor or Gleovine its extremly powerfull i think on the other hand errand rider makes it bonkes also. Northen mercenary has a typo in the name. I also like that Dale has made an apperance in the set. All in all good work but proably needs to be playtested and louse some of its power, just my to cents.

Hi. I limited lust of wealth to once per phase, we'll see if it's gonna be enough. Cards are some sort of wealth, because without them - you'll be stuck with a pile of resources.

 

Thanks for the typo, will edit as soon as I arrive home. 

 

Not probably - it needs to be playtested for sure, I doubt even professional game designer can release balanced product without playtests, and I'm nowhere near that :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

Thanks for your response.

I'm not sure why anyone would ever play Stalking It...

 

Otherwise there are tons of great cards in there. I'd love to have the time to playtest them all and give you feedback... if only.

 

Maybe I should just go through and help you fix all the typos I find at least.

About Stalking it... the wording is "Put Into Play", so if you're afraid of some nasty "When Revealed" effect from monster - you search for it and deal with it without any when revealed, as monster technically never revealed. It's a planning action, so if there is some really strong adversary you never want to deal with - you can search for it and immediately slap it with Forest Snare.

These are first two I came up with when you asked the question.

 

I'd be very greatful, thanks.

Nicely done trololo!

laying low is my favorite.

I can really see that card happening in the real game, but with any character.

The way the card lets you "pay" by exhausting characters instead of using recourses is just great.

And so I think it's cost of 1 is spot on too.

Great card. Make it happen FFG! Or face my utter helplessness in any influence whatsoever!

Note that you pick a player to reduce his threat by 2 for each character you exhausted, so you can potentially reduce 3 people's threat by 2 each or one playes by 4 and another's by 2, aside from straight single player 6 threat reduction - all given if you exhausted maximum of 3 charaters to pay for this ability.

Updated, with some new cards and fixes/reworks to the old ones.

There was some wierd issue with imgur which led to the display of outdated images. Fixed now.

Looks really good and balanced.

Thanks. I'm actively tasting it, I think there is some overwhelming cards in need to be toned down and underwhelming waiting to get boosted.

Any plans to make the other two Stewards Fear villains into heroes? The redeemed trait is something I never thought of.

I'm sure you'd do a better job than me so I won't suggest anything. I did like how you keep the same type of action for the Hand. So you could use threat for the Daughter and top of deck cards for the Bane.

And of course, awesome job on all these cool cards.

The main problem of turning villians into heroes is art. There is high resolution art of Hand on the internet. But I haven't seen any of Daughter or Bane.

You dont need so high resolution. Reduce first the template and after put on the image. The enough resolution you need is about the final job image... normally less then 500píxels.

A Saruman hero with the Redeemed trait could interesting as well.

Redeemed Saruman would be a re-written history. Saruman ally we have right now is the Saruman before the exposure, as Grima is.

Yes, I understand it would be a fictional character, just thought it would be interesting.

Here is a couple of quick redeemed Saruman concepts I thought of.

Very impressed by the amount of work put in here. Some really good ideas.

Trololo if I put in the effort to play test this and give feedback (which will involve paragraphs!) would you read it? (It would be a week or two from now at the earliest).

 

 

Edit: Is the Tattered King a neutral sphere hero?

Yes, I would.

 

Yes, he is neutral.

These are both very cool. I especially like the second version. Fits perfectly (as I'm sure was planned) with wormtongue. I'll keep my eye in this thread, it's pretty interesting.
