Has anyone had much success with the secrecy keyword yet? I've always enjoyed playing secrecy decks but have never really been able to get them to ring. Recently it seems there has been some decent secrecy support so I've started experimenting again.

I'm finding that ironically, it seems to have become more viable as a cooperative play deck. I can usually get a pretty good resource curve going, quest pretty well, and find that Merry (who I thought woukd be the key) is much more potent and consistent at reducing threat in multi.

I am struggling with secrecy decks in solo, primarily because I can't seem to find a good way to deal with enemies, and Merry's threat reduction is shakier and more costly (exhausting a hero is steep price in solo.

Anybody else been experimenting with secrecy? It feels like it really should work but I just can't find that sweet spot.

I have been using a Hobbit Secrecy deck (with Spirit Glorfindel) against all of the recent scenarios, with quite a bit of success.

Yeah, I've used a similar deck to the one Dan posted, and it is very strong in both solo and multiplayer.  Leadership secrecy decks tend to focus on big allies and can be really strong because of Timely Aid.

 

I've also made a few spirit/lore secrecy decks with Glorfindel and Pippin.  This one [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112151-the-no-engagement-deck/] uses Mirlonde as the third hero and relies on scyring and traps to take out the enemies.  I also made one with Frodo [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126764-hobbits-and-elves-solo-secrecy-companion-deck/] that focuses on Hobbit Pipes and threat reducing events to keep you in secrecy and draw a ton of cards. 

 

I've tried a few decks with Merry, but have found for the most part found that his ability is often not worth the loss of 2 willpower. It's just easier to stay in secrecy with Glorfindel and events like Elrond's Council.  I've also thought about combining Merry, Glorfindel, and Frodo with Song of Earendil to make a multiplayer deck that soaks up all the threat, but haven't had a chance to try it out.

I've had a lot of success with a Nori based dwarf secrecy. It is my favorite way to play dwarves.

I've had success with a Sam/Galadriel secrecy deck full of big allies. You get out two of them with Timely Aid and Sneak Attack, then Galadriel's Mirror grabs you a Very Good Tale every round.

I'm sure your deck is solid dan, but it's really not a secrecy deck.   It has 3 copies of Timely Aid and Rescourceful and that's the only secrecy cards I see.   That's really not making much use of the Secrecy keyword, IMO.    It really hardly counts....

 

## 7 [Ecthelion III on October 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1848004)

Secrecy isn't all about the keyword. It's also about engaging enemies when you want to and getting benefits when you do.

## 8 [Teamjimby on October 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1848014)

My version of Dan's deck has Celduin Travelers and Ithilien Lookouts.  A great starting hand is Timely Aid into some big ally, then play a Traveler/Lookout, and now you have 2 allies costing 7-9 for a Very Good Tale.

That's the whole point. Secrecy is not supposed to be found in every card of the deck. I mean, you still need the Tests of Will, Runes, allies and attachments and whatnot that every deck needs, or else the deck would be terrible. The idea behind secrecy is to start at 20 or less threat, play a few key secrecy cards early on, and then function like a normal deck. If the majority of the cards in the deck had secrecy, it would be a pretty bad deck.

I'm also playing these and even Rivendell scout. With Faramir and a bunch of absurdly cheap allies, you get great questing numbers. Otherwise, it's a similar setup but with spirit Merry instead of Glorfindel, and fewer combat oriented cards, since it gets played in 2 handed with a Dunedain deck.

okay, sure, but we have how many secrecy cards and you're telling me that only 2 of them are playable?

## 12 [Gizlivadi on October 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1848888)

Kinda. I mean, most of the secrecy cards are playable, but it's only a handful that are essential to this deck. Timely Aid and Resourceful are cards the deck depends on to be successful, while the other secrecy cards you don't really need them. The 1 cost events and most of the other secrecy cards are cool and useful, but they're not essential (except for Noiseless Movements in a secrecy Haldir deck). I do think the deck would benefit from Ithilien Lookout though, as he is an extremely good card in secrecy. But as I said, in this specific deck, as well as most secrecy decks, you only need a couple secrecy cards, the rest of the slots being used for must-have cards every other deck uses. For the Secrecy Dunhere deck you need Resourceful and a couple other Spirit secrecy cards (Out of Sight works great for those enemies that do get through), but you don't need to fill the deck with secrecy cards. In fact, in this deck you only need secrecy for the first couple of turns; after you've set up you don't care if your threat is above 20.

## 13 [Denison on October 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1849028)

I have so many high cost allies in my version of this deck (Sam/Merry/Pippen) that I threw in Taking Initiative.  38 of the cards trigger it in round 1. Helps draw into Timely Aid and might even ding an enemy in setup. In my most recent game it took out a scout sentry in Massing, in which I cruised to an easy win.  The deck includes 18 secrecy cards. Most of the other cards are 1x unique allies, which definitely ups the fun/variety factor.

Thanks guys....wow...some great ideas. Dwarf secrecy? Now that's thinking outside the box.

I guess I've mainly been focusing on the lore aspect of secrecy running encounter deck manipulation. Testing it against nightmare Khazad Dum (new favorite deck tester) it does alright until a big enemy slips through.

I guess I'm interested experimenting with secrecy with two caveates....1. No Glorfindel....I am so sick of playing this elf and refuse to believe that the game is only beatable with him and 2. I want to make secrecy a prominent theme....not just turn 1. There are a lot of powerful secrecy cards out there......"Risk Some Light" is one nobody has mentioned much....it's just finding the right combination to tie them together in a fun and interesting way.

I have found what is awful for secrecy is 1st round doomed and big enemies. I feel like if you can figure these out, there is a viable archetype under the surface.

## 15 [mjd83 on October 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1849137)

Interested to hear more about secrecy Haldir deck? Please say it doesn't involve Glorfindel? I tried this with Mirlonde, Haldir, and Merry....but found Haldir is less effective without leadership or tactics to boost his combat. Really, it's tough to findicate much attack at all with spirit and lore.

## 16 [Teamjimby on October 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1849149)

I'd suggest trying Frodo, Pippin, and either Merry or Mirlonde.  With Hobbit Pipes and lots of threat reduction you can get some insane card draw.

## 17 [Gizlivadi on October 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191203-secrecy-deck-strategy/?do=findComment&comment=1849151)

It does utilize Glorfindel. And no, you can't replace him with Merry because it uses Tactics Merry to get the bows on Haldir. Still, if you're tired of Glorfindel, maybe just don't run Light of Valinor? He's much more balanced without it. In any case, the deck focuses more on Haldir and getting him to snipe enmies in the staging area. It's a pretty cool deck.

I wonder if Elrond + Merry would make a viable secrecy deck.

Well, I don't know if you count this, but I saw a two-hero Outlands secrecy deck (timely aid and resourceful anyway) at GenCon using only Hirulin the Fair and Theoden.   It was pretty boss.

The Sam/Galadriel deck I posted about earlier only has 2 heroes. But the only card with Secrecy is Timely Aid.

Relies pretty heavily on Gandalf to lower threat though...

I've also used an Outlands Secrecy deck with Hirluin and Sam [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111997-leadership-outlands-secrecy/].  You get 2 extra willpower compared to Theodred and Sam can reliably use Hobbit Cloak to defend for 4.  The thing I really liked was that you could play Bill the Pony and Rivendell Scouts for free and use them for a Very Good Tale.  This is also the only deck where I've successfully used Taking Initiative.

To try to give myself a new challenge, rather than restricting the decks our group can make, I've been restricting myself to 2 heroes. If my friends like outlands, then I've just been having fun with secrecy and other "threat less than engagement cost" cards or whatever related stuff, like reusing those 20-or-less event cards. I've enjoyed Sam+Pippin and Sam+Merry, just swap the green cards for the red cards depending on how much fight help my friends need. It's possible to make 3 heroes work with secrecy to start with 20 or less, but I've been enjoying tinkering with any random two heroes, like Imrahil + Bifur for some cheap purple expendables and some expensive greens for free. I'm gonna try pure green damrod and mirlonde soon, too.

Thanks to the outstanding community here contributing advice, I think I finally crafted a solo secrecy deck that is both potent and thematically satisfying.

I decided to go with the Haldir angle. Yes, I unfortunately do need Glorfindel, but by making it an all elven secrecy deck, he goes from being a crutch to a thematic inclusion.

I decided to drop out Merry and get access to tactics through one of my oft overlooked and forgotten all time favorites, my old friend the Rivendell minstrel. The other cool part about this decision is the replacement with Mirlonde allows me to play on the rivendell/lorien theme. There is not a single non thematic card in this deck, as I've purposely left out power includes like quick beam because I can't stand the thought of ents in Moria and frankly don't think I need him. This deck is all about fixing enemies in the staging area and destroying them with Haldir while questing with strong wp ally support.

The other nice thing is that about a third of the deck is either secrecy or secrecy related cards, so it actually feels like a secrecy deck and not just a dash of secrecy thrown in. I think I've covered all of my bases except the use Glorfindel, and I've even found a way to minimize the pain of using him by making him thematic. This was all based on the suggestions people made on this thread so Thanks!

Time to go up against my favorite deck tester (and some of my favorite quests to date BTW), the nightmare Khazad Dum quests.

I'm sure there will be some fine tuning, but I'll report back how my secrecy experimenting is going.

Hi you all.I'm a long time player of meccg but i play this game right from the start.I got every expensions up to date and waiting for The Land of Shadows now.This is my first post but a long time follower of this Forum.I only play Dwarf/Hobbit decks because i don't get much time to build new decks so i stick to 2 decks and modify them.So@Duke:Could you please post the decklist of that Dwarf/secrecy deck?With Hobbits secrecy is logic but Dwarves sounds too cool.

I have made a dozen version s of the deck, but that is one. I call it a secrecy deck, but really Resourceful is the only secrecy card. The deck is really about drawing crazy cards off LoD and Ori, then playing lots of dwarves to drop below 20, using we are not idle, zigil miner, and resourceful to generate resoures. You want to chump block and use WotW to recycle and repeat. Once you are rolling, hail of stones is amazing, killing enemies in staging area and erebor battle master finishes off bosses. The deck is slow, but has a very high potential. For instance, it completely owns the Battle for Laketown quest.

I forgot to day that Hidden Cache would be a perfect card for this deck.I think it's o.k. raising it up to a 53 card deck with such a good card draw.

I am currently building a deck with Galadriel, Sam and Bilbo. It has a starting threat of 26, but it's easy to get it below 20. Decksize is at 64 atm, but with 3 card draws each turn (as a solo player) that really doesn't matter. Galadriel's Mirror could give you even another card draw. I'm posting the deck once I have it optimized. So far it includes 13 secrecy cards, but I'm probably going to increase the deck size for some more.
