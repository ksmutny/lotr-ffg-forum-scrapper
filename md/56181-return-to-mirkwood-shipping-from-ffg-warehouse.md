That means it should be in local game shops in 7 to 10 days - just in time for a Thanksgiving weekend of gaming!

Dain II is coming with reinforcements!

Ironic side note: The Game of Thrones: The Kings of the Sea reprint is "on the boat"

If they want the big box in stores for Christmas retail, this early push on return to mirkwood makes sense.  I can't wait!

Dain is in RtM?  I thought you meant he was the other Dwarf in KD in the previous thread.  I'm a little surprised that we'll see 3 dwarves in a row.

Me to, surprised to see three dwarves in a row. But whatever, is there a link?

If I'm going to be building dwarf decks, then I say bring on the dwarves. Dwarves riding on eagles that are riding on rhinos that are riding on motorcycles equipped with lasers. Yeah, the Balrog is scared and rightly so. When the Fellowship encounters him in the books/films he's not actually chasing them, he's running away from the heroes we sent in after him. You can see that he is practically begging Gandalf for assistance on that bridge. Unfortunately for him, Gandalf doesn't speak Balrog.

Marlow - those parts must have been in the Unfinished Tales.  It's a shame Tolkien did not get them in the trilogy as it sounds very exciting
