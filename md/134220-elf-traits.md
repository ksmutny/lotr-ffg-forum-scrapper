We know from the latest article that Noldor will be a focus in upcoming packs next to the Rangers. This got me thinking about traits.

If we do see a Cirdan hero (it fits the area, and would be a reason to give us Narya), will he have the Sindar trait? Legolas and Celeborn are traited Silvan, which has always bugged me a little. I would rather they made Cirdan a Noldo than Silvan - I'm finding it hard to believe they're creating a new elf trait for him at this point. I realise you can't have too many traits floating around. Has Matt, Caleb or someone else ever addressed this?

Now, for the love of the sweet almighty god, please DO NOT create another trait they will not develop in ages. They got a good position on the elf traits - Noldor and Silvan are perfect divercification and regardless of thematic issues need not fall apart.

Yes, I noticed it too, as did Master of Lore (he wrote an article about it). They probably won't, and if they make a Cirdan hero, my bets on him being a Noldo. Celeborn was made a Silvan I guess, becausr he is their leader. A part of the people playing this game will come from the movieside (the not all that interested in lore-side), so I guess that's why they choose to do so. Also, given the tineframe of our game, it's quite hard to develop a Sindarin trait.

## 4 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1438565)

They will not split the traits not because of people coming from the movieside, but because it will serve no good purpose gameplay-wise. I come from movieside and when I first arrived I didn't even knew there was things such as Noldor or Silvan, I thought there were just elves.

## 5 [Solaufein on February 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1438571)

They could always give him two traits, one meant just for flavor, and one to time him to whatever elves they want him in on.

## 6 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1438575)

Well, they haven't, fortunately, done things like this yet and I hope they will never do.

## 7 [GrandSpleen on February 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1438782)

I agree that we should not get another elf trait, lore be damned.

Don't be a fool, just because some of us can't stand Tolkien's terrible writing doesn't mean we're not interested in the lore. I definitely consider my self from the movieside, but just because I won't put myself through the torture of reading the most dry, boring, awful writing this side of Moby D*ck doesn't mean I don't like learning about 2nd Age stuff or the history of the characters.

 

 

PS. It's super dumb I have to censor a famous book title.

There's just one but. There wouldn't be a Second Age if it weren't for that 'stupid writing'.

Thanks for the heads up, good read! Here's [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2015/01/31/anticipating-angmar-awakened-the-heroes/comment-page-1/] the article in question if anyone else missed it. I'm also excited about new hobbits.

Doesn't make the writing any less awful.

"Roaring he swept back over the town.  A hail of dark arrows leaped up and snapped and rattled on his scales and jewels, and their shafts fell back kindled by his breath burning and hissing into the lake."

Evocative! This is a scene I thought BotFA did well, despite the changes.

 

For the record, Galdor could be an ally in the upcoming cycle - and Lindir too, for that matter. I'd dearly love to see some elf-magic, FFG!

Tolkien and Moby **** insulted in the same thread? Oh hell no, Queequeg, hand me my harpoon! 

## 16 [JsBingley on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1440915)

Trait doesn't mean theme-deck, so Sindar could be like Esgaroth, Dale or Bree, it just a trait and won't appear in other place in the textbox.

 

Yes, I have the same question about the trait of Cirdan, Narya was not with hero Gandalf, then it must be with Cirdan. This makes Cirdan more likely to appear in this game. If he has a trait, it should be Teleri.

 

Many attachment and card effort said "Noldor or Silvan", so I guess there won't have Teleri trait, but I like to see it under the name of Cirdan. He can be like Galadrial, support Silvan greatly but with a Noldor trait.

It shouldn't be Teleri. Cirdan never went to the Valar and thus never saw the light of the Trees. Therefore he's a Sindar. At first he is part of the Teleri but he is part of the group of the Teleri that stay behind. Collectivly all Elves who didn't see the light of the Trees in Valinor are weaker and he is one of those, but then one of the greater. Celeborn was too and I thought Legolas also.

Boat cards? Like the idea, but Boat cards.. If there ever will be some, I'll at least be suprised!

## 20 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1441797)

Well, a boat can be an attachment, like mount.

Oh God, what I have started...?

 

> Also, would Cirdan be the only Elf with a beard?

 

Yes, in-lore I think that's the case. The Time 3 is because according to HoME they can only grow it during the third cycle of their life (I think? Feel free to correct me).

## 27 [gandalfDK on February 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1443054)

Yeah, I thought that too.

Don't know, have yet to read those books. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 28 [Distractionbeast on February 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134220-elf-traits/?do=findComment&comment=1443129)

Yes, bearded Elves were rare because they do indeed grow beards only in the third stage of life, and not many around middle earth were that old.  Cirdan I think is the only one ever confirmed to be bearded.  This is why the art on Lore of Imladris feels so weird to me.

 

Of course, Tolkien doesn't go into much detail about this aspect of the Elves, but we know that:

 1. Dwarf women are bearded
 2. Dwarves were created with some foreknowledge of the nature of Elves/Men
 3. Galadriel is getting pretty old
 4. Galadriel seems awfully relieved that she can leave Middle-Earth with the others finally

I think maybe Galadriel's a little self-conscious...   :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Cirdan is Silvan for the purposes of this game since Silvan is a catchall for all non Noldor elves. The only thing that bugs me is that the light of valinor can be attached to Silvans and Noldor when it should be the very definition that seperates them

Excited to see the Noldor trait developed though. I'm guessing their theme will be threat reduction.
