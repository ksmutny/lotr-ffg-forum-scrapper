Hi All,

Can you play burning brand on a non-lore dwarf hero with Narvi's belt? I don't think so as Narvi's belt only gives attached hero the resource icon of your choice for that phase and not the round. But I just want to check in case you can exhaust Narvi's belt and give the dwarf hero access to Burning brand to defend cancelling out any shadow effects. But then how would it attach in the first place!?! Probably answered my own question, but just checking.

Thanks

 Yes you can. New FAQ.

Hero needs to be lore only the moment you attach BB.

So you have to exhaust the Narvi's Belt in the Planning Phase to give the Lore resource icon to that hero and then attach the Burning Brand to him, and it will stay until discarded by other game effects.
