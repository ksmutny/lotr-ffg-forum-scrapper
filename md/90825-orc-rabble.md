A quick question about orc rabble from Siege of Cair Andros. On the card its says:-

 

Forced: When Orc Rabble is dealt a shadow card, it gets +2 Attack until the end of the phase.

 

There are several cards which deal extra shadow cards, am I right in saying Orc Rabble gets +2 attack for every shadow dealt to it? Or is it just the first one? I have been assuming its every card, which at one unlucky stage resulted in Orc Rabble having +12 Attack!!!

You are correct that it gets +2 Attack for each shadow card dealt to it.

Yeah, this is an evil card and all by itself is a good justification to include shadow cancellation in your deck for quests where it shows up. It will still get the initial +2 from the first shadow card, but if you can cancel shadow effects it won't cascade...

I actually just made it today. I'm really bored. Anyway, back on topic, does anyone else find the Orc Ravager from Nightmare Cair Andros even more annoying? With the Rabble, you can just defend with a chump blocker, but the Ravager can stick around indefinitely swinging for 3. Enemies can really pile up in that quest.

yah its because of the shadow cards that to this day, I have never beat this quest with more than 2 players. I mean, when there are 3 or more attacks being made every turn, the chances are astronomical that you will loose a hero in the first 2 turns.
