So here's a daft idea for an ap

The ap comes with three objective type cards which are Nazgul heroes.

Quest card 1 causes you to replace your deck heroes with the three nazgul. From this point on you are playing as the bad guys. The allies in your deck are considered to be controlled or possesed (to explain good guys with bad guys) and maybe certain cards have to be discarded, eg Istari (so you would deck build around this).

Then, the encounter deck gets to feature a load of good guys against you, and if you draw an encounter card of an ally you have in play, the ally is discarded (converted/possessed).

Just a novel way to get us playing the bad guys for a change :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
