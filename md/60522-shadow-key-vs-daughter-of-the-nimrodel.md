Shadow Key is an objective with a "Forced" response: "At the end of each round, attached hero suffers 1 damage".

Daughter of the Nimrodel can exhaust to heal a hero.

The last step in the turn sequence in the rulebook is green, which means players can take actions.

My question is:

Can I use the Daughter's healing action *after* the Shadow Key's damage is dealt, and then refresh the daughter?

Or is the damage dealt *after* the refresh step?

 The refresh step is the final phase of the round.  I would say that "at the end of the round" effects happen *after* the refresh step is finished.

yeah, i would look at it this way- whats the largest chunk you can break the game into ? - rounds......so, if it says at the end of the round, then it pretty much comes after all the smaller chuncks such as phases an actions....its the very end of all things done in a round

 How about the Silvan Tracker?  I imagine he could be used as his ability is a Response and occurs when the characters ready.  Of course it would have to be Legolas with the Shadow Key to benefit.

readying occurs AFTER the start of a new round. So the "at end of round" condition triggers b4 that...

As for Daughter.. no.. you can not tap it after this condition triggers and before the refresh phase.. BUT there is plenty of time before the end of round to trigger her ability.

 Refresh is the last phase of the round, but looking at the flow chart the Refresh still occurs before the end of the round, so yes Silvan Tracker wouldn't heal after the damage.

But still, being one round behind on your healing is not too big of a deal.
