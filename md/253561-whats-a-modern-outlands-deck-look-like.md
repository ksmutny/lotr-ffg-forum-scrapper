I have always loved the scene in RotK when the soldiers are arriving at Minas Tirith from the outlands of Gondor.  But i have always resisted the Outlands deck out of principle (and partially because I am so angry that the Knights of the Swan are so lame.)  Recently I thought what the heck, I'll give it a go.  Surprisingly I actually didn't feel too dirty afterwards!

I haven't really kept up much with the meta though.  Have the Outlands been developed much in the last two years?  What does a modern outlands deck look like, if there is such a thing?

This is a good one: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1708/agressive-deck-series-1-outlands-3.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1708/agressive-deck-series-1-outlands-3.0]

Completely crushes 90% of quests.

I think the only explicitly Outlands card that has been released since the Against the Shadow cycle has been Prince of Dol Amroth [http://ringsdb.com/card/12146], which has always felt like a bit of a win-more card to me.

I've been having fun with an Outlands / Harad mashup lately:

But I think a lot of modern Outlands decks use Erestor, like Seastan's example. What they really need is a faster start, and nothing is faster than Erestor.

This deck is pretty absurd!  Was just gold fishing with it and regularly getting down 5 allies on turn one.

Started with the 13nrv build I feel like I upgrade it with my Galadriel version. I have a multiplayer one (http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5318) [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5318] and a solo one (http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5741/erestor-outlands-for-solo-1.0) [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5741/erestor-outlands-for-solo-1.0]

Prince of Dol Amroth is in fact really low. Fun, thought but help you only when you can win without as Authraw says.
