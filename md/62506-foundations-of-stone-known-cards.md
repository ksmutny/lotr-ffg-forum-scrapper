Just got a look at the GTM #146 for April. It had an add for Foundations of Stone featuring a really cool piece of artwork with an Aragorn like figure who was holding a glowing sword and peering around a corner. It also had some cards on there. One was the Nameless Fear.

Another was a treachery card titled Lost and Alone which had a great picture of a hobbit crouching in the dark and had an effect that had something to do with shuffling a HERO into your deck and then I assume you could put them back into play when you drew the card. Pretty crazy!

The last card was a partially obscured Tactics event. I saw half of the picture which seemed to be a dwarf putting the beat-down on an orc's face. I couldn't see all the text but it seemed to have something to do with if you deal X damage to an enemy, play the card and double that amount of damage. It might be for dwarves. All the art was really great!

That eased the pain of my LFGS NOT having Road to Rivendell... a bit.

I've never been one for spoilers in the past, but with the Dwarrowdelf cycle I just can't seem to help myself! Some of these things sound amazing too - is there anywhere online I could find this???

I don't think so, you have to find a hard copy of Game Trade Magazine

Spoiled player cards for this game have really become an addiction. I should consider there is something wrong with me.

And? Scan any chance? I would have bought it myself had I lived where it is being sold.

I had to buy it off ebay in the end, hopefully it shouldn't take too long to come, then rest assured a scan will be posted here!

Yes, well done, and you got me there, I could have bought it on e-bay myself. Hopefully the admiration you get from the fellow gamers when you post the pics will refund your efforts. Cheers.

Yes, that is the only payment that means anything to me lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] Actually, it was only £2, so hardly broke the bank...

Well, with the possible Hobbit deluxe on the possible horizon, this seems somehow like yesterday's news now, but the magazine arrived today, so - ta-daa!

Until I can get my scanner working again, I've only got my camera (which isn't exactly good for this sort of thing), but you get the general idea.

The card to the left of the box, Lost and Alone, reads "When revealed: Each player ... shuffles a hero he controls into ... When he draws that hero, he ... " Shadow: If attacking enem... defending player must disc..."

The Elder Nameless Thing has of course been seen already. The Tactics Event on the far right isn't exactly spoiled:

"...als X damage to ... al an additional X ... once per phase.)" It also has a quote from The Fellowship of the Ring, ending with "legs apart" - whatever that could involve!!!

So there we are, then...

Now someone needs to check out GTM 144 and 145 to see if there's any previews of Dwarrodelf 3 & 4!
