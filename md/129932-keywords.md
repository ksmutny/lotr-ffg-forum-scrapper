How would you translate ,,Doomed" and ,,Surge"?,,Doomed" is in game more like ,,cursed [http://click.thesaurus.com/click/nn1ov4?clkpage=the&clksite=thes&clkld=0&clkdest=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesaurus.com%2Fbrowse%2Fcursed]",,,threatened" [http://click.thesaurus.com/click/nn1ov4?clkpage=the&clksite=thes&clkld=0&clkdest=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesaurus.com%2Fbrowse%2Fthreatened],,,ill-fated [http://click.thesaurus.com/click/nn1ov4?clkpage=the&clksite=thes&clkld=0&clkdest=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesaurus.com%2Fbrowse%2Fill-fated] "etc.And ,,surge" is more like ,,wave", ,,   efflux" or     ,,intensification" etc.

Thank you and Merry  Christmas!

are you asking what it does or what would be a thematic comparison to the effect?

if your asking what it does, doomed X means raise your threat by X and surge means reveal an additional encounter card

thematically, threatened would be a good one for doomed and I think surge is a good description for what it does.  think about it.  The enemies, locations or treacheries are Surging out of the encounter deck.
