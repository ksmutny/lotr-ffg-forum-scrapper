The second.  50 card minimum does not count heroes.  They are separate from the player deck.

The heroes are not inclueded in the 50 card minimum, as the heroes is not a part of the player deck, unless a card effect specifies to the contrary

the effects on the locations that are travel effects only effect you when you travel there- thrors map makes it the active location but you are not travelling, so no
