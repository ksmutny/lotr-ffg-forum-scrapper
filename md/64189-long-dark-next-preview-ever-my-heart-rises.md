I'm dying to stick Ever My Heart Rises attachment on Thalin. His best use is questing to deal damage to revealed enemies so I never use him for combat. This would be a great way to get him involved in questing and combat. Of course, it would work just as well, if not better, on Gimli.

I am not fond of these situational cards. Right now there must be like two thirds of quests where this card is useless. What is the overall consensus, do you fellow players keep your decks the same or do you build and rebuild them for each scenario?

 I pretty much rebuild for every quest.

I don't like scenario dependent cards since I don't rebuild between games.  However, only one of the three cards is scenario dependent.  Erebor Battle Master is an unbelievable killing machine.  i can't wait to roll him out in my dwarf deck.

We've been using the same decks for a whole cycle but also a side deck of like 5-10 cards to switch out in between games for certain quests. That way it's mainly the same decks but I can switch in like a couple extra healing cards for Rhosgobel or take ally Arwen out if we're on the first two quests of the Dwarrowdelf cycle, etc. So I don't mind this card as it can join cards like that or Bombur that are useful only during certain quests in the side deck.

I have always kept the same deck(s). Or picked a different deck for different scenario. I now see the "side-board" of sorts may be a vital option.

I know only one card is situational - but it was the title of the thread. 8) And I agree, the dwarven ally seems so strong; certainly too strong in comparison to the other two Tactics dwarves.

I fear he might be too strong. Dáin gives each dwarf already an attack bonus of one and this guy basically does the same, only that he focuses the bonus attack points on himself. He has already 4 attack points from the start if you play with three dwarven heroes, and as I usually have around 5 or more dwarven allies around when I play… and he isn't even unique!

The Ring Mail is the card I like the most. It is solid, but not overpowered. And I like that they start to give us attachments for allies.

I have a favorite themed deck (dwarves, elves and hobbits) that I just continue to modify if I want to when the new packs come out.  I am loving these new dwarf cards!

I love the new tactics cards, definitely going to put them to good use in my Spirit/Tactics deck.

 That new dwarf ally really does seem powerful, but the more I look at him, the more I detest the artwork. It looks like it belongs in Warhammer or Rune Age or some other Tolkien knock-off. It doesn't seem to fit with many of the other cards.

 Me, I usually rebuild between each quests, and try to optimize my deckto beat the quest at hand. However, there are staple cards for each sphere that are rarely excluded, and this one might say it's more of a core deck with a few modifications :-)

I basically got into this game because of the dwarves… wasn't that interested until I heard about the Kazad dum expansion, and that caused me to pick up the core set, and every expansion in between, just so I could be ready to take down moria… lol. As you can imagine, i'm more than pleased with these three cards. I've found pure dwarf decks to be very difficult to run and more luck dependant than my other decks  (have far more luck with my rohan builds). I'm really looking forward to the next set. I doubt we'll get a dwarf hero… but that would be awesome too. Hoping for a Thorin or Balin in the hobbit pack.

I share your affinity for Dwarves Captain Poe! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yea, I am looking to rework my decks to abuse this. When teamed with Lore, it is easy to boost one of them to sufficient attack to kill almost anything. (A couple record keepers and a hammersmith and you are looking at an attack of 7! That is easily achievable third turn) Of course, getting attack strength is not necessarily game breaking since you still need to deal with the defense somehow. If this guy could attack the staging area then we would have a different story.
