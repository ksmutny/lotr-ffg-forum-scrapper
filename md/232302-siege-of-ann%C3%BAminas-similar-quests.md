For anyone who has attended GenCon: wich quests do you think are similar to Siege of Annúminas? I mean, in terms of objetives, pacing, dificulty, or combat / questing / location intensity.

 

I just want to try and tune some decks for Fellowship 2016, that are both appropriate and useful.

 

Thanks!

Battle of the Pelennor Fields is similar in a damageable objective, a location that gives each round more eamage to that objective and goddamn high difficulty. The separate quest stages are handled in Foundations of Stone, Breaking of the Fellowhsip and Escape from Mount Gram. Orc enemies are everywhere, and that's why Dwalin's underrated.
