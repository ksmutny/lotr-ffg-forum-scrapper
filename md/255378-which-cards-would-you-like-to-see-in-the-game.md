Since the game is about to die, or so it seems people think :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Which cards would you like to see before its end?

For example The Horn of Rohan [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Horn_of_Rohan]

Ooh, The Horn of Rohan is a good one.

For me, it has to be Thranduil [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Thranduil].

Yes Thranduil.  I can't understand why they've waited so long!  And still no news of him on the horizon or anything.  Basically the only major character left who has no representation at all in the card game.

I'd bet we will get Thranduil in the next deluxe/cycle, with it being set at least partly in Dale, it fits to see Mirkwood in the Northern Rhovanion cycle. 

As for me, I'd love to see hero Saruman, hero Radagast, and non-generic Palantiri.

The Horn seems like it would be a great fit!  Especially since it has an already established effect.  I'd really like to get hero versions of Rumil and Orophin that had abilities that synced well with hero Haldir (one of my favorite hero to use).

I fully agree with Thranduil! I have quite hopes we will see him in the next cycle (that is if there is a next cycle :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] )

Spirit Celeborn ally (with gift-giving ability).

It's not so much a specific card, but rather a mechanic. I'd like to see more attachments similar to Dark Knowledge, which have a cheaper resource cost but you take negative stats as a cost for either an ability or boosting different stats.

Adding the requirement that you must have the stat to spend (can't attach if willpower is already 0 etc) adds some value to heroes with stats that are often considered 'wasted'.

I'm really hoping in the next cycle we get a Spirit version of Dain Ironfoot that will support the dwarf deck milling archetype.

Wouldn't that be interesting? You've got me thinking up some ideas now...

Maybe, "Action: Once per phase, you may discard a card from the top of your deck to ready a Dwarf character." I think either would be interesting.

Could do Dain as a Tactics hero too. "Response: After an enemy is declared as an attacker, exhaust Dain and discard 3 cards from the top of your deck to cancel the attack."

I think either could be a really fun hero to play with. I don't know how competitive they'd be against the global stat boosts of LdDain.

Saruman hero.

Do we know for sure the setting of the next cycle?

We pretty much do.

Thranduil hero and Meneldor ally

Turin and Isildur.

Normal player cards, not boons, for some of the most iconic named armor and weapons from The Hobbit and LotR -- Sting, the mithril shirt, Orcrist, Glamdring, the Arkenstone, the Phial of Galadriel, and Anduril. Maybe even a playable version of The One Ring!

Would also be nice to see normal player cards for the individual palantiri that make an appearance -- the palantir of Orthanc and the palantir of Minas Tirith.

As well as the other remaining one in Emyn Beraid or the Tower Hills, under the care of Círdan.

I definitely agree than some more cards for an eagle deck would be awesome, may be even an eagle hero?

Hero Bofur! Because then we'll have all of the living dwarves from the Hobbit as Heroes. 

I'd like to see a Grimbeorn Hero too, along with a little more development for the Beorning trait. It probably doesn't need too much, but it would be nice if it ended up about as fleshed out as the Eagle trait. 

I also want to see Dale get developed into a full-fledged faction. 

Edit: Now I'm trying to figure out who they could use as Heroes for the Dale trait. We could easily get another version of Brand. Any reason we couldn't also get Bain (his father) or Bard II (his son)? Are there any other possible options that I'm missing?

That would be nice. I'd also like to see ally versions at least 2 of Balin, Oin, Nori, and Ori. That way it would be possible to play a single deck with each member of Thorin's company. Ally versions of all 4 would be best, for maximum versatility, but I'd really like to be able to put a dwarf deck together with 10 of the 13 named dwarves as allies, 3 as heroes, and the rest of the deck filled up with attachments and events.

Brok Ironfist the second? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Saruman & Radagast as my obvious choices. I love the idea of playing a two-handed White Council deck; Gandalf and Saruman on the same side would be a fun possibility. I'd be curious to see if FF opts to reinforce the Saruman/Doomed and Radagast/Creatures relationship or take them in a different direction. If hero Radagast is similar to his ally version it would be good to see some non-Eagle Creatures introdued to support that.

Thranduil, yes, but also Gildor. A powerful and fairly important character who certainly deserves a hero version.

Echoing some other voices, more Dwarves - hero Bofur, Tactics Dain, Balin ally, etc. Rather strangely, Dwarves lack good Tactics heroes, Gimli being the only one I play with any regularity. I would also be delighted to see Dis (Thorin's sister). I think the game has done a good job of dealing with the lack of female characters in the books, with the majority of FF-created heroes being women, but might as well take what you can from the source material. While I realise Tolkien wrote that Dwarven women rarely went abroad, I think a little license is worth taking here, and perhaps could be dealt with thematically by special abilities/restrictions.

Lastly, more Hobbits! Heroes and allies both. I'm surprised I don't hear this requested more. It seems there's a good chance of Spirit Sam arriving in the last Saga box, but even though I welcome that (and wouldn't mind seeing Lore Frodo or Spirit Bilbo) what I would really like is new hobbit heroes. We're limited to six at the moment (five if playing the LotR campaign) and as someone who chiefly plays two-handed theme decks, that's frustrating - especially considering Fatty is pretty poor and Bilbo overcostly. Plenty of options in the lore, with various Tooks and Brandybucks, Farmer Maggot, Tom Cotton & sons, etc.
