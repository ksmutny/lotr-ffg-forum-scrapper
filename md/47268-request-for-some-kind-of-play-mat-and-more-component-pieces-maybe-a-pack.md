I would love to see an official play mat for this game - in theory it could be cloth. The game is fairly strictly laid out so the mat design could be the ME map with rectangular boxes set out where you are mean't to put each deck or individual cards.

Along with the play mat, there could be more component pieces provided - damage, progress and resource tokens.

And finally, why not have a small box to keep your tokens secure? I've attempted one myself, it's ok but I'd much prefer an officially made one. Some images of it are below -

This could all come in a box like the Adventure packs. Not seen it happen for the other product lines, but here's to dreaming lol.

I would also love to have a play mat for the game, that would be awesome! My Bilbo side loves the idea!

I bet there will be playmats at Regionals, once they have them for this game.  Both Warhammer and AGoT have them.

I'd much rather like to see a set with fewer component pieces, i.e. just the (player) cards.

They do have a lot of beautiful art that would work nicely on a playmat. I like those large, thin mousepad style mats, though those aren't that important to me.

If we're on the topic of dreams about seperate supplies, I'd love to see their tokens colored/shaped for this game as an option instead of the cardboard ones - fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp [http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=86&esem=2&esum=127]
I've always loved the weight and feel of those type of tokens <3 They're like candy!

Though yeah, honestly you don't need tokens at all, you can just grab glass beads, dice, or whatever generic thing you have for other games.
