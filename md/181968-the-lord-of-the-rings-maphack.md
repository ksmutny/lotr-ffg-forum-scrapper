Based on the map of Middle-Earth, I marked the rough locations of all the quest so far to record my plays.

 

It seems we have a lot of place to explore, Shall we have the Iron Hill cycle? Shall we have a naval battle against the Umbar pirates? How about the blue mountain and Cirdan?

 

I just don't want to see the main series end with the ending of Saga.

 

Cheers for the great game!

Thanks for sharing this. It is very interesting to see what we have yet to explore. I can easily see exploring Mordor or Harad.

Very nice! 

I also think a Forochel cycle would be interesting.  I think if they borrowed a few things from LOTRO they could have a pretty interesting story up there.

Ok so I was thinking about this game ending and thought that it has to end sometimes.  I mean, they've come up with some marvelous, unique ideas over the years but if you have two unique quest, the game starts to become a bore.  also, I don't think people are going to keep buying and buying as the game progresses.  you also notice how the quests and player cards get better deeper in.  that can't go on much longer. also, the more new cards that come out, the more likely it is that every one of the original quests will have cards that absolutely trump them.  heres how I think about it:

as the game gets bigger, less people will continue to buy the new set, and people who come into the game feel overwhelmed because there are a freakin TUN of sets to buy and they don't what to spend a literal fortune on a game.

in short, the game can't go on for much longer.  but I think thats a good thing.  we already have 60 + quests and with angmar cycle and rest of lotr saga that's almost 80.  there are so many great quests (as well as a lot of not so fun ones) that if you play 1 quest a day, (many people play it less) you can last 2 1/2 months without playing one quest twice!

Yeah SaurontheGreat. I left the game for about 6 months. Recently pulled my collection back out. I am behind 2 sagas and about 10 adventure packs. I need to drop about $200 right now to catch back up. I don't have the money to spend all at once so I will try to slowly build it back up. It is a discouragement though to feel so far behind. Love this game though...my favorite of all time. Will still be playing it long after the sets stop coming out.

Cool map by the way. Good work!

Yeah, the problem of the ever-increasing buy-in is a problem for all the LCG's. I also don't know much about game retail, but I've also heard it mentioned that it can be problematic for store owners to either have to stock a ton of expansions for these games or choose what to stock, how to explain it to customers, etc. Anyway, the idea of FFG releasing ready-made decks or at least a pack containing the best cards for a particular trait/deck type (i.e. a "Dwarf" pack, a "Noldor" pack, etc.) has been mentioned before and could help with this problem, but I don't know if they would release something that could potentially be viewed as competing with their own products.
