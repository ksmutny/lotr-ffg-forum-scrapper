 I just recently found LoR:lcg and am loving it...

 

but my quick question isn't about the game, but about the site - what are the points for?

 Great Question Mike the Turtle! I don't know either, and I am curious. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I will join you in asking the same question to the more experienced Fantasy Flight community members. I do believe it has something to do with promotional stuff when you accrue enough points.  I see Gimli is your avatar...you a huge fan of dwarves? I certainly am! Happy gamming!
