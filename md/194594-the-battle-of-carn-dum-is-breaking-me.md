I don't think I've ever come across a quest that has beaten me so bad and so consistently as this one. I've tried at least a half dozen different decks, ones that I generally consider quite powerful, and I just get my head stomped in each and every time. 

I think my record is five progress tokens on the first stage.

 

Any tips? Because I just don't have any handle on this one and it's driving me crazy.

I have 5 successful playthroughs up on my channel (some with minor mistakes).
