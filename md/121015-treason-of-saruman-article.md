So when might we be getting an official ToS announcement article?

 

I really want to see some new cards spoiled :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hopefully shortly after the Nin-in-Eilph spoiler we get any day now!

I have a hard time imagining that we'll get an official release article until after the road darkens is released so likely in October (since Darkens should come out in late september)

 

Possibly worth mentioning that even though we were told that the title of the 2nd LOTR saga expansion was titled "the road darkens" at Gencon 2013 we didnt see the annoucement article for that until I think February of this year...also worth noting they didnt reveal any box art or player cards for it at that point like they did for treason of saruman this year so maybe they're farther along in development

They have a tradition of announcing products way before we even get the previous ones, so I think we may get an announcement pretty soon.

One can only hope.

Can't wait.

 

They also said it was expected early next year, meaning the saga schedule has (hopefully) been cranked up a notch!
