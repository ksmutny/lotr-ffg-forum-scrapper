Hi folks,

after playing Drowned Ruins with the option to add some of the Grotto-locations to the victory display by using Leave no Trace. We thought about adding the whole Grottodeck into the victory display will ruin the scenario.

Is it possible to add a Grotto-location via Leave no Trace Â in the victory display? If yes, does this count as having an underwater location in the victory display?

Adding the two normal Underwater locations via Leave no Trace in the victory display makes this scenario much easier.
