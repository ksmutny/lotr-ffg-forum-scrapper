I probably enjoy making custom stuff too much for my own good. However, I dare say these changes would bring proper revitalization for those old cards, while also placing them on good terms with the currently developing ranger(and sometimes hobbit) engagement cost manipulating and utilizing theme:

Nice!

I always loved these cards anyway, and I try to fit them in decks sometimes but they just don't compare to some of the more recent cards. These changes would be very welcome indeed!

Yeah some of these are actually really great and way more playable . I especially like the two events

I find it kinda funny how those two events work so well together (which was completely unintentional from my part), because Fresh Tracks makes sure the enemy's engagement cost is higher than your threat, and also brings it closer to death, making that additional card draw from Taking Initiative more probable.

They do combo together quite well!
Taking Initiative is definitely my favourite of the four. Love the reduced cost mechanic you included, I hope we see more of that in future player cards.

I just copied with they did with Take No Notice and In the Shadows. judging by recent Halbarad and Shiriff allies, they're still providing slight support for this ranger/hobbit engagement cost stuff, but they are yet no signs of other upcoming stuff for this in the spoilers. None that I'm aware of, at least.

Tweaked Son of Arnor a bit so he is more like his former self.

In one of the printed ads for the game, Son of Arnor was actualy a Doom 2 card!

Actually he was a Doomed 3 card and was called Dead Marsh Hunter!

And there was Dain instead of Gloin, who could spend damage tokens on him as resource tokens.

Thorin, not Dain.

Yes, those pesky dwarven names got mixed in me head.
