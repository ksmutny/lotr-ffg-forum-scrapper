 Core set quest 3, two players, high possibility to reveal 2-3 locations each turn. Without northern tracker its nearly impossible for us to quest successfully…

And do we have treefolk ally cards in any expansion pack?

Snowbour Scout, Denethor, Secret Paths, Lorein Guide, Power in the Earth, Strength of Will, Legolas. Thats for the core set. Much more in the expansions.

 

I'm not quite familiar with the term, if treefolk are elves, then yes, but if they are ents, then no.

 If you are playing 2 player games and reveal 2-3 locations a turn, you maybe doing something wrong……..

1. its possible to get more than 2 locations if one location has surge…

2. tree folks are trees in human forms…

3. legolas only put quest tokens on current quest, not locations…

4. what are dale scout& bombur in a fashion?

5. asfaloth is what i need, thank you rich, i will buy this pack.

There are only two locations in Escape from Dol Guldur with surge and both have pathetic 1 threat. There are a couple of 3 threat locations that can be drawn (2x Necromancer's Pass), but if 2 players can't come up with 7+ willpower between the two of them, issue one to improve would be: more willpower.

1. Yes, but then it is not highly possible each turn……..just once or maybe twice a game. There a re 41 cards and 11 locations.

2. No we haven´t seen Ents yet.

3. Legolas puts quest tokens on an active location first. Locations always act as a buffer. This is also somewhere in the FAQ on the FFG homepage.

4. Dale Scout is an ally who lets you transfer quest tokens from one location to another. Bombur can reduce the threat of an location by one.
