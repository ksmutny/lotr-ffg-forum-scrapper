So I know not many people have it, but I figure I'd throw it out there because it's pretty vague. Can you use Frodo's response to cancel (for example) the Hide 2 triggered by revealing a Black Rider from the encounter deck; and then subsequently shuffle him back into the encounter deck? Is it really :that: powerful?

...cool. Can anybody tell me where to direct my rules questions for FFG?

Well, it is impossible to answer a question about an expansion that is not out. But for questions, there is a link at the bottom of every page of this forum (Rules Questions).

For posterity (and Rich!):

I figure he wouldn't mind me posting it here since the card has already been spoiled by FFG anyway
