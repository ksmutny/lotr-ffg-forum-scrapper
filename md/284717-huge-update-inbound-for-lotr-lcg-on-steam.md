Something had to change, since they'd wandered into a system that made it hard to find anything to spend money on.

Yah I didn't find anything too pricy but I also bought in and had ample valor points. I think if you didn't buy in and just played as a free-to-play player it may have not felt very F2P at all. At least now people are making fewer purchases for more content.

I like these changes. The Pathfinder adventures cards game did run to serious economical problems because people were playing it without paying a dim... And the development of the game ended too early because it was not sensible to make new content to it (without getting development money back). They did try to change the economy mode later, but it was too late for that.

Now FFG at least know that they have steady income with each expansion. (If the game is popular enough) Also many country seeks and destroys games that has loot box systems... So putting on the market new game with that system would just lead to attacks by government official and lawyers. So more likely than not they would have had to change the economy mode in anyway sooner or later. So it is better to do before the real release.

In competitive environment you have to spent money, so that you don't lose to players that have all the new cards and you don't. In coop, you can easily play without ever using any money, because it does not matter if other players have better cards. You will get them sooner or later. Sometimes many year later. In competitive card game it would have been real pain, to loose all the time to opponents that does have those new cards, so there is a pressing reason to sink money to the game. And the game does not live a long if it does not make profits to the developers. You have to play salaries, earn something to the share holders and so on. Now there is change to that.

I think it is a fun game, and I'm glad they are making these changes to steer it away from a freemium game with microtransactions. It will definitely make more sense this way to call it a Living Card Game similar to the physical editions. With it coming out on Switch it seems like they could easily just sell it for $30 or $40 and people would buy it based on the license alone.

Do you think that the digital game will be good for the tabletop long term?

I really don't know. The digital game will probably draw attention to it, and I highly doubt it to steal players from the card game. That said, it will add confusion, and draw frustration from some.

Hard to say... it is so different that it is almost completely different game. If player goes from tabletop to it, he is completely lost for a while. Same with moving from digital to tabletop. Everything you learn in digital is done completely different way in the tabletop version.

there was/is huge outrage in the Steam about how bad the digital is. Expect to see huge outrage in here a Little bit later when people from digital come to here and tell why the tabletop is so awfull compared to digital ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

in reality these two does not impact each other. The tabletop can Outlive the digital or vice versa. Maybe we will get Lotr 2.0 that has same rules as digital version some day who knows... but all in all They Are so different that They don`t touch each other in anyway except use same graphics.

The best time would have been the design stage. Or maybe in alpha or private beta. Not months after people have already spent a decent amount of money on the product. It's "out" in every meaningful sense.

This is a private beta haha. You can only enter of you pay. I'm just saying it would be worse if it was full release and they were making big changes.

It's early access. Beta's, especially private ones, don't usually charge for playing but send out limited amounts of invites instead.

Imo this is the fatal flaw in the understanding of AE. If everyone is allowed access for a (smaller or larger) fee it feels like a full release. No matter how many info boxes might pop up. And if the game doesn't live up to the expectations, improves or doesn't even have a good communication between fans and developers it is doomed (most likely).

But that's not the intention of AE. Developers want feed back (and finical security), because some stuff is best checked by many people. Stuff like the monetisation. For me their initial plan sounded perfectly fine (even though I wasn't happy with some details) and I am sure they were happy with their idea, too. However it seems it didn't work out so it had to change. More or less exactly what you want from AE. This isn't "Oh no they didn't even had that figuered out, game is dead", it's "hey they noticed something they/the community aren't happy with and try to change it for the better". The game is IN development right now. Not just for content. Technical issues and yes even fundamental design decisions are tested and subject to change. 
How should the monetisation have been tested "in alpha" or "private beta". Most likely the shop wasn't even working at this point. No way you could have tested if thousands of people would invest enough money with the planned system, so you needed a public test. With real people, having the option to spend their money.

This got a little longer than expected and maybe reads like a rage, but for all the disappointments that happend with AE, I hate to read that decisions like this one are a bad thing during AE, shouldn't happen or that AE is a meaningful release (a I said: for me the greatest misconception the gaming-community can't get rid of) as FFG, in my oppinion, are doing a great job with the AE (giving weekly updates, streaming, patching). This is independant from the success of the game. The core idea is set and they try to optimise it. If the game fails (low sales, no players etc.) so be it. Many "great games" never were a success or even got studios closed. So just because your game may fail, doesn't mean the development process failed too.

The private betas I'm involved in are invite-only and involve signing NDAs. This is a public beta period. Anyone with a credit card can participate.

Getting rid of the gambling aspects (the palantir) makes sense; not only does it not feel like an LCG, it would open them up to a lot of potential regulation.

This is a great move in my opinion, 50% of the reason that I haven't got involved in this digital version of the game was because it had the micro-transaction / loot crate stank on it and I just can't be bothered with business models like that.  Besides, the vast majority of games with that model fail miserably so I'm not really sure why the industry continues to try this.  It works.. sometimes... that is not a great track record to base your game on.  I'm not suprised they are changing it and I definitely support the change.   That said I think it will backfire on them horribly.  

The issue here is that the LCG community, aka, the people who play Lord of the Rings the Living Card game are the target audience here and they have already largely rejected this Lord of the Rings the Hearthstone clone game concept and on steam the only people who are going to try playing it are the ones who can do it for free.  You stick a 30 dollar price tag on this thing and the general gaming community won't give it a second look.

That said the other 50% of the reason I haven't tried this game and probably never will is that I don't understand the point of creating a card game based on a successful card game, but then changing the gameplay to be something completely different related only by the art work used.  Look, I'm a fan of Lord of the Rings the Living Card game... its the game I want to play, if your going to make a digital version of the game and you want me to buy it,.. do that.. make a digital version of THAT game... don't make a "Lord of the Rings The Living Card Hearthstone".  If I want to play Hearthstone... I will play Hearthstone.

I just don't get it, who is doing marketing research over there?  This is a somber, happy community that loves Lord of the Rings the Living Card game... just bloody make it for us and I will mail you my credit card, but ... whatever this game is.. its not Lord of the Rings the LCG on a computer... so hard pass until that is addressed.

Yeah it's a rushed and poorly implemented idea. The UI looks bad (reminds me of HearthStone a lot) and the gameplay doesn't interest me knowing that there is a more complex and strategic version of that game. It would be cool if they just made a 1:1 client where you can upload your physical cards via some barcode in the product to also have the online multiplayer experience but what they are currently doing is a no no from me..

It's an improved 2.0 version of the game.

The game is going to be more microtransaction-based than before, now that valor won't be used to buy most new content. They're just dropping the soft loot crate mechanic where you earned free crates constantly (and couldn't buy them with real money).

The two views here are not mutually exclusive.

You can applaud their willingness to change based on feedback while still faulting them for the initial lack of vision.  The original design was painfully unoriginal - from the visual design to the gameplay changes to the monetization model, it was little more than copying a bunch of other games.  Recognition of the limitations of that is good, but it doesn't make the original design decisions any less bad.

Personally, the changes have me willing to buy into the game.  Lump purchases with a set amount of gameplay is a lot more appealing to me than having to grind the same scenarios every day to fill my collection.  My only concern at this point is whether there will be enough content to justify the cost.  Designs like they started with cover for a lack of content by giving you a monetary motivation to play it repeatedly.  Take that away, is there enough to make it worth the purchase cost?  Remains to be seen, IMHO, but I'm at least interested now.

You mean compared to the physical game?  Uhm... no, no it's not.  At all.  At best it's an entirely different game.

I assumed he meant 2.0 of the online version.  The online version improves absolutely nothing in any way shape the paper version.  It's  hallowed out,  empty shell of a game right now.  There is some potential for improvement here but I think it would require an overhaul the developer/publisher will not want to invest it so I don't think this game has much of a future.  It's clear that they have realized this at this point and are probably just hoping to cut it's losses.  After all, if it was successful, they wouldn't be making alterations like this.  I just don't think what they are doing right now is going to be enough to shift the opinion of this community nor enough to capture the PC gamers on steam.  Card games in general don't do particularly well on Steam, you can count on one hand the amount of successful ones that didn't insta die over the last decade and there have been a metric ton of them.

You assume wrong. The framework of the digital game is far better than the tabletop one, it just lacks content. Compared to the original core set it's an incredible improvement.  

Even as a F2P product it was light on stuff to do, as a pay-only experience it needs at least 5x the quests, twice as many heroes and a much bigger card library to even resemble a basic budget digital product.

I...  huh.  If you prefer your games stripped down, dumbed down, and playable in 10 minutes while you're waiting for the bus then sure, I guess I can see where you're coming from.  To each their own.  But maybe let's see where the digital is 7 years from now...

The attack/defence/health system is better, limiting number of characters each side is better, two card draw is better etc. There are lots of ground-level improvements to the design.

These are not design, though they are elements of it.  These are actually good examples of what makes it worse - the game is dramatically simplified, with far fewer interesting decision points and moving parts.  That may be more to your liking, but they're most certainly not improvements.

Yeah, there is no universe where the digital version of this game is better than the physical. It is an entirely different beast that shares the same namesake and art, nothing more.

That's not to say it's a bad game, I am enjoying it as I find more time to get into it. I like the mechanics and the game is an interesting challenge. However let's not try to say it is something it is not; I could play "Passage Through Mirkwood" with just the core set 50 times and enjoy it each time. I go through the first quest in the digital with each new deck I make but I do not enjoy it as much. It's more of a "well as long as the app doesn't screw me over this should work" feeling.

We will have to agree to disagree.  To me the game mechanically has absolutely no depth, no thematic flavor, tactically and strategically it's practically barren and it lacks the core feature of Lord of the Rings The Card game which is that it's supposed to be a multiplayer cooperative card game.  

I also take offense to the idea that a publisher takes a beloved card game franchise, markets it as "the digital version of the game" to get you excited and then changes every single thing about it to make the development of the game easier and cheaper for them which coincidently if you are wondering why they didn't just make an honest version of the paper version of the game, that is why.  Simply put, they don't have the development budget or chops to pull it off.   What's worse is that from a design perspective, there is nothing original in this game, so even standing on its own as a game its totally uninspiring and content won't fix that, the problem is at the design level of the game.

Remove the Lord of the Rings theme and make it a generic fantasy game and none of us would even be having this conversation because no one would touch this game with a ten foot pole, it would be known as a Hearthstone clone and might even be getting sued by Blizzard for so blatantly ripping off their game.  The only reason it's even in anyone's radar is because of its use of the Lord of the Rings Living Card Game IP.  The worse part about it is that the digital game has already failed right out of the gate (its why they are scrambling to fix it somehow) and the result will be that not only do they lose their asses on digital product, but it will have a negative impact on the paper game because people who try the digital version of the game will realize it sucks and assume the paper version must then also suck.

Nothing positive will come out of this digital release, most likely it will be the final nail in the coffin of the paper version which is sad really.  Had they made an honest digital version of the paper game, it would have most likely given the paper version a second life.

I, unfortunately, don't see any positive outcomes of the current situation.

The most likely one: the game fails. And with it, the possibility of other FFG card game ports, along with the only shot to see a good LotR LCG digital adaptation (which is already come ot pass, due to game not being anything like the tabletop version).

The less likely one: the game succeeds. And with it, the thought that watering down their games is the way to go reinforces. And istead of stuff like Android Netrunner or Call of Cthulhu card games, we'll see empty husks, resembling their tabletop counterparts in the name and the art.

Although I agree that the digital game isn't anywhere near as good as the tabletop game, this I would consider an ignorant and prejudiced claim of someone who never gave it a fair shot (either that or you don't know much about Hearthstone other than how it looks). The similarities to Hearthstone are rather superficial in a way that is pretty obvious if you actually have played both games even if you completely ignore the asymmetry and scenario setup.

Hmmm programmin complex scenario based card games is really hard. Scenario rules can change the game so that it is almost different game than the normal. It is good with Humans... it is bad with computers.

the Pathfinder Adventures is the best example how the scenario based card game is almost carbon copy of the real tabletop game... and ques what. It is full of bugs. The basic idea is tha you find the Villain and corner it and kill down. Those scenarios works really well! But special scenarios where there is something different Are buggy like a ****. For example scenario where you try to save people from the Flood and moster... was a long time very buggy. Or scenarios where there only is one location... that scenario is still very buggy. Because the scenario powers change the game so much that normal game engine does not behave nicely any more. You have to completely rewrite those scenarios. It is like makin whole new game just for some scenario rules... that takes time, and resources and money.

it is no wonder that The digital game is almost completely different than the tabletop version. It is easier, it is more cost effective and it definitely is easier to squash bugs from that code. Simple games like Magic and other games that use same rules in every game Are simpler to make. So Android Netrunner could be possible to make carbon copy or L5R but games like Arkham horror Lcg will definitely be allmost completely different in digital format than tabletop version, unless the company is really crasy and wants to burn money... pity but true.

i think that the digital Pathfinder adventures is a better game than LOTR, but it has a cost of making it uneconomical to the company.

so this game is totally different than the real one, but it is still quite good card game! And it is different because of very good reasons...

I guess you could probably make something that follows the same rules as the physical game but has different cards and quests, so you don't have to struggle with implementing horrible things just because they were in the original game. But I expect people would still call that dumbed down anyway.

I don't get the Hearthstone grumbles at all. The game clearly doesn't play anything like Hearthstone. It's actually quite difficult to make a comparison of the game flow to any other game I've played.

Game being full of bugs is a result of bad QA, inexperienced team, and questionable development strategy. Game can be complex and still run fine. Looking at LotR LCG Digital right now, I see little to no reason to play it instead of logging into Hearthstone and knocking a few of the PvE thingies for free. And I don't even like Heartstone, and a long time tabletop LotR LCG fan.

People prefer different things.

But one thing I've noticed people like to do is compare the depth of the current state of the tabletop game to the early-access core set of the digital game. Obviously the game with a 7-year head start on the card pool is going to be deeper.

Thinking back to the core-only days of the tabletop game, bow much content did I actually get for the $40 I paid? Well, Passage through Mirkwood was a really easy quest meant to teach you the game, and I only played it once. And since Escape from Dol Guldur was impossible as a solo player, it left me with only 1 enjoyable quest to play. On the player card side, the deckbuilding was very shallow, as nearly half the cards were overpowered staples (Eowyn, SoG, ToW, Hasty Stroke, Feint) and the other half were overcosted for what they do.

Meanwhile, the $8 buy-in to the digital game gets you 5 playable quests, with future one-off encounters being free once they get released. You get more total player cards, and way more playable player cards because they use the gameplay data to buff the underplayed cards until they become useful.

Having been around for the core-only days for both games (well, the core for the digital game isn't even done yet), there's no comparison. The digital core set provides much deeper content for a fraction of the cost of the tabletop core set.

I won't necessarily speak for anyone else, but my comments on depth have to do with the rules, not the content - and I think that's what most people are referring to.  LOTR requires you to allocate resources across at least 3 different tasks; the digital game simply lacks this, in the name of simplifying the experience.  There are any number of other places where the game has been simplified.  Whether you call it "streamlining" or "dumbing-down", the result is the same.

This isn't necessarily surprising, but it's also worth considering what it will be two (or, again, seven) years down the road.  Software engines tend to have very smooth difficulty curves right up until they hit a cliff.  Over time you're likely to see a lot of very same-y scenarios, because expanding the engine for new ideas is going to be rather hard.  Maybe they'll surprise me, but I doubt it - when a game is behind schedule like this it usually indicates a lot of technical debt which will make that sort of thing even harder than it would be otherwise.

I mean, if you list all the things you have to think carefully about in the physical game and say "these are the necessary components and if you don't have them your game is bad" then yeah, the digital game is bad. But I can do it the opposite way round and you'd be forced to conclude that the physical game is bad.

I think some aspects of the digital game are great; 'attacking' side-quests, fate and threat events. I'd really like to see a 'Return to ...' series that incorporates some of those ideas, along with a campaign aspect.

I don't believe I actually said it's bad.  What I have said is that it lacks the depth that the physical game has.  This is pretty much indisputable - it's a far, far simpler game, with far fewer decisions and far more forgiving allocation of resources (generically, not just resources resources).

That doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad game, per se - simple has its own elegance, if it's good.  But saying the digital game is an improved 2.0 of the physical is like saying Elder Sign is an improved edition of Arkham Horror.  Sure, the basic outlines are the same, and they reuse the art, but the games pretty much have nothing at all to do with each other otherwise.

I'm reserving judgement on whether or not the game actually turns out to be good.  I'm skeptical.  Everyone's been focusing on the business model change, but the original business model has heavily informed the design of the game.  It's not easy to shift gears from "Give them minimal content that we expect to replay dozens of times to grind for Valor" to "Give them enough content in a box to justify the price tag".  Maybe it all works out and turns out to be a good game, but so far it doesn't look promising.

I would say the reason the business model is important is because it is the qualifier for trying the game.  As people have pointed out, many (myself included) are judging the game before trying it and while that may seem unfair, with twitter, youtube and endless content providers I don't need to buy and try the game to know if it works for me or not.  That perhaps was true 10 years ago but today you can know everything about a game from watching the lets play videos, tutorials etc.  Im not going to discover anything about the game I don't already know about before I try it.

Setting aside for a second the games mechanics, as a business model is the primary reason I haven't bought into it.  To me it seemed pointless to buy a game to which I saw all of the content available for it in a 1 hour video.  It simply didn't have enough value and there was nothing for me to explore.  It was setup as a grindfest to get cards, one that was made difficult to try to get you to buy into microtransactions and simply put the answer on that is a flat, NO, there is just too much of that sort of thing out there already and simply put, the game is not good enough to invest in microtransactions (very few games are).  At least with this new business model there is a chance I might give it a try but they still need to make the game more interesting.. closer to the paper version.  Until that happens, the answer is still no.

I'll say it again. They should have made a 1:1 adaptation that allows you to import your physical cards via the proof of purchase codes. It would boost the physical game's sales too. This game would have the biggest appeal to the original fanbase anyway. What was the point to change the rules/mechanics completely.

No. Just no. If tabletop cardgame was just released alognside it, then it might've been an interesting business strategy. But considering circumstances, by allowing players import their physical collection they would be setting themselves up for an investment with no return, and no sane person does that. Releasing newer packs with codes that give you goods in digital game might've work in current circumstances, since it would entice physical card game players to try out the digital version, and provoke digital players to buy physical stuff. But just giving everything away immediately on release would just spell financial disaster.

Well actually, I do dispute parts of this. In the digital game, there are actually more decisions to make than in the tabletop game. I do see your view expressed frequently though, so I'll expand on what I mean:

In the digital game, Sauron gets a chance to act after every card you play or action you make. This means in addition to deciding *what* to do, there's a whole parallel set of decisions you need to make, namely the priority of your actions. And this will shift over the course of a round as new information becomes available.

Imagine the planning phase of the tabletop game where it mattered what order you played your allies and attachments. Imagine the quest phase where the order in which you commit your characters to the quest mattered. Imagine that the order you defended and killed enemies mattered all the time, not just every once and a while. It adds an incredible number of decisions to the game.

Some math:

Let's assume I have 6 characters on the table. Each round, a character will quest, attack, or defend, and you get to decide what they do.

In the tabletop game, the order you perform these actions either normally doesn't matter, or is determined for you (questing always comes before combat, defending always before attacking, etc.). This means that there are 6 characters * 3 actions = 18 possible ways this turn could go. So I'm essentially deciding on one path out of 18.

In the digital game, action order is critical. I have to decide which of the 6 characters I use first, then which of the remaining 5 I use second, etc. In total there are actually 6!*3 ways the game could go, where 6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1. So when I play a turn of the digital game I'm deciding on one path among over 2,000.

Granted, the board state in the tabletop game tends to have more characters on it, but the way the decision points scale in each game, you only need a small number of digital characters to dwarf the decision points of a huge tabletop game.

The problem is that people see the phase structure of the tabletop game as more complex than the digital game (it is) and therefore conclude that there must be more decision points. But this is in fact the opposite of what happens. By limiting certain actions in the tabletop game to certain phases, you actually end up with fewer player decisions, not more.

Your math on the tabletop side is off.  There are 150 possible ways to allocate 6 characters to 3 different tasks.  That also ignores that there's a lot more to allocating those resources than just what they do - the order you defend or attack in matters in the tabletop.  Even just 2 or 3 enemies engaged and the combinations balloon quickly, and that's before you consider shadow effects which can throw it all off, encounter effects which will change engagement, etc.  LOTR isn't just about resource management, it's about risk management.  I believe that you will always have something to do with your characters in the digital game, because questing can effectively be done at any time; how many times have you held someone back from questing in case an enemy showed up, but none did?

The digital game also gives you many more resources to work with.  No resource matching and twice the card draw make it easier to both get and draw cards, and the smaller deck size is going to make everything you do more consistent.  Hence, easier to manage.

Even if your math was right, you can't just count the number of decision points and call it a day.  The impact of those decisions and the thought that has to go into them is, if anything, even more important.

Yes you're right my math is off, sorry about that. But both calculations are off by the same factor. Without ordering it's 3^6, with ordering it's 6!*3^6, so the point still stands. There's an extra factor of n! possibilities.

I'm well aware of how interesting combat can be in the tabletop game, especially with the surprises the encounter deck can pull out with its shadow effects. I think it's one of the best things about the tabletop system actually.

As for the resource system and number of cards drawn - I don't see the clear connection between this and game depth. One of deepest experiences I get with the tabletop game is when I play with my favorite hero, Erestor, where I'm drawing 4 cards a turn. Another pet card of mine is A Good Harvest where I can play cards without a resource match. So I think this is highly subjective territory. Maybe it's also worth pointing out that there's an option to only draw 1 card per round in the digital game if one desires that challenge.

Do not forget a character's power, so in some cases you even have 4 possibilities. And as the number of enemies and obstacles increase so do your options as to what to deal with first. The questions are not only 'Who do I act next with?' and 'Will I fate up, attack an enemy/obstacle, guard or use the special power?' but also "Which enemy/obstacle will I attack?".

This still Early access... only crasy enough people (like me) Are there now as a labrats testing early beta version of the program aka EA.

Most changes we get at this moment Are balance changes, card changes, some bug fixes etc. There is very Little new content at this moment, so not much to play with. These Numbers seems quite valid at this point.

When the game is released and there is the co-op multiplayer, I Expect to play the game much more! 

So stay away of this piece of Goram untill it is ready ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] unless you Are brave or pritty indeed.

And Yes, the game is allready quite nice. Too easy IMHO but that it is why we Are still in EA... a lot of things to do, to make the game better.

New adventure packs can't be purchased with the grindable in-game currency (which the expensive founders packs give loads of), so yes, you will need to spend actual money going forward.

There's nowhere near enough content to justify spending money on it, and very little suggestion that will change. Tiny deck library, one short 5 quest campaign (plus a single "hard" quest I can't be bothered to try), a handful of new cards released over 2/3 months. Disappointing as the actual game part has a lot of potential.

Well, sure compared to the actual card game the content is closes to non existent. But you have to start out somewhere. We started the physical game with a box of 3 quests. One ment to be played as a tutorial, one with great replayability and one to hard for many people to enjoy. With the player cards given to you, there weren't many "viable" decks, and in true solo even less. Was that content worth 40$?

The digital game is at the same point. There are few player cards and even fewer quests. But everyone should be able to complete them (as there are 3 difficulties). And we have more to come. Getting a ton of in game currency means you won't have to worry about getting new valour cards any time soon. And the more heroes and quests release, the easier it will be to farm up the valour points (for doing decent with a hero in a quest).

So yeah. There isn't too much content at the moment, but it's the same with any new game that is based on an ever growing cardpool and you can get in for iirc 8$ and get the first five quests (+the new "encounter", a "ultra-hard" quest, think like a POD quest) and player cards prior to the recent update. What is (imo) a really good deal, netting an absolute minimum of 3 hours of gameplay (for playing the quests once and listing to the story with it's complete voiceover). Than you can obviously improve your score or increase difficulty. Worth it in my opinion.

You shouldn't be comparing it to the tabletop game, there is no point, it doesn't competes with the tabletop version. What you should be comparing it to is other digital card games on release.

I am sorry, but I just don't know/play an other digital cooperative card game.

I was trying to make the general point, that most coop games, which fokus on a scenario design and a growing card pool, will suffer from "a lack of content" in the very beginning. 
And to support this argument, I think looking at the beginnings of the LotR LCG is completly reasonable.

Obviously Calvadur is right, especially since it's just in Early Access plus the game, like the LotR physical card game, is designed to expand over time, judging the game by its starting content is nonsensical. However, for me, if I need to pay for each expansion, I'll stick with the physical card games.

It's not reasonable when you take into account what market the game is breaking into, and who, justified or not, gonna be it's competitors. And competitors are gonna be other digital card games, which have a lot more cards (both on release and especially currently), and infinite replayability (live opponents), not to mention some games have pve as well (Hearthstone, Shadowverse, TES Legends, etc). You're not gonna get far by trying to compare the game to it's tabletop counterpart. It's two different markets.

I even add to John Constantine point that:

- There is also an ongoing competition in the card game digital market, with the beta of Magic Arena, who know a big sucess, the developement of Artifact, the next Valve project. There is many card games and LoTR seem to have many issues right now that may cause his early death.

- The LOTR physical game core set is really a bad deal. It is mandatory for playing the rest of the game. But there is only one interesting scenario when you buy the game, almost no deckbuilding possible. I think LOTR get lucky to offer a cooperative version in a time where the cooperative offer was small (it is not longer true), and it get it first expansion release quite quickly as far I remember (I start the game with the first AP, so I was quite early but not enough for this point ^^) so this was also quickly forgiven by dedicated players. But it shouldn't be taken in example for any further game.

Let's stick with hearthstone (i am most familiar with, from the games you mentioned) and play it through:

What is the core of Hearthstone: Short (about 10-15 minutes I'd say) 1 vs. 1 battles. Does this, in any way, compete with the gameplay of the LotR LCG? No.

What about the solo content of Hearthstone? Appart from the recent Dr. Boom riddles, they always give you AI-Opponents with stronger cards/heropowers to combat the horiffic AI and create a challenge. Partially you can create a deck to beat them, partially you have an "on the go" deck building. Could this appeal to someone interested in the LCG?  Quite possible.

I thinks it is totally fine to ignore the PvP aspects of other games as the LCG never was meant to directly be played against other people (we got this mode with the fellowship event, but come on that isn't PvP).
So if we compare to HS we just have to worry about the PvE part. And at the moment there is much more in HS. Though you have to grind or pay quite some money to get the adventures (Meaning you coud also get the mithril pack for the LCG). And then you are still stuck with mostly basic cards and have to play a game mode you didn't care about in the first place to grind cards or pay even more to get them quick.
After some tinkering you finsihed the adventure (in hard mode) and then? Do many people come back to replay them? I don't. The content is more of a riddle to solve and once that's done you are done. HS asks the question, if you can come up ith a deck for a specific task, and while you are free to do that in the LCG, many people like to come up with a deck that can beat as many quests as possible. Or is as thematic as possible. Hearthstone doesn't offer anything in this regard at all. The modes with "random" deck aren't what a LotR LCG player looks for, as "complex" dedicated deck building as a core aspect of the game.
Summing up: Hearthstone might have more "pure content" at the moment. But it puts PVP first. If you enjoy that part of the game, you will have a nice collection to get the most fun of the PvE. If you don't you have a huge paywall for this content or have to grind a mode you don't like.

Intro: The Lotr LCG. Quite small at the moment there will be at least 16 quests upon full release (I'd argue 1 quests in normal mode easily offers as much content as 3 bosses in a HS adventure in normal mode). All with multiple phases and their own story (something HS only as the absolute minimum of to have a setting for the SP content). You are encouraged to beat the quests in as many ways as possible and as good as possible. New cards you also get either for money or with ingame currency, which you get for playing a game mode you actually want to play.

To bring this to an end: The LCG and Hearthstone can easily co-exist like the hawk and raven. Even though both are birds one doesn't push awy the other. Same goes for the card games. The LCG wants to cater to other players than HS. Sure there are players interested in both and as HS exists much longer they might stay there/don't participate in the AE because of a lack of content (and I repeat the content you get for just picking up the shire pack is great). But once the game has a full release with triple the content they might reconsider it.

One last thing: IF you should have to compare the LCG to HS, you would have had to compare the physical LCG to Magic: The Gathering. And magic outclassed LotR by a huge margin and many other card games did too. Even I house products did. But it became a hit, despite inital lack of content.

 

TL;DR: The LCG caters to other player than other popular digital card games, putting PvE over PvP, therefore trying to find it's own niche. The inital "lack of content" is impossible to prevent as other games are much longer on the market, but will (obviously) go away with time and can't really be an argument against the game.

Tiny deck library, one short 5 quest campaign (plus a single "hard" quest I can't be bothered to try), a handful of new cards released over 2/3 months. Disappointing as the actual game part has a lot of potential.

Just think what it was like when the physical game was released and you only had the core set: a very poor entry point to the vast, amazing game we have now.

It doesn't compete in a gameplay, it does compete as a digital card game for people with limited time. LotR offers small gameplay time and it's pay to play now, HS offers all of it's PvE content for free gated only by your progress within it, and it rewards you if you do it.

It's fine to ignore their PvP aspect. It's not fine to ignore their existance. Why tabletop LotR succeeded? It offered a possibility to play a card game alone, without the need for a human opponent. Digital card games eradicated the requirement of a physical human opponent due to internet, there is not much need for a game like digital LotR like there was/is a need for game like tabletop LotR. LotR's super bad tabletop core set experience worked because there was no alternative. This won't happen with the digital version. People who play digital have too much free alternatives that are free, offer much more game time and replayability. And most outsiders will just shrug the game off as "yet another HS clone", like I keep seeing in the comments. Not to mention the divide within the tabletop fans. Steam numbers don't lie. The players you think it is supposed to cater to barely exist.

Yes and no :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don't like Heartstone at all... But I like the Digital LOTR lcg even it does not have anything common with the tabletop version. And I really think that tabletop version is much better than the digital one. But still the digital version seems to be the second best solo / coop digital card game around.

I think that Pathfinder adventures is best, but it is so full of bugs that you really have to like to play it. Next comes the LOTR DLCG and third seems to be Legendary DXP... So no much competition around at this moment.

All in all LOTR DLCG will have more content in the release than the tabletop game did have. But it "suffers" from more simpler game play. To some people it is a good thing to some bad thing. But it is what it is. Enjoyable solo/coop digital card game.

I see where you are coming from, but I have to disagree.

Players always have to choose what to play thats right. But by offering a different gameplay than an other game you are as unqiue as you can be. I think, I wrote enough why I don't think the singleplayer content HS offers satisfys LCG players.

To say ignoring the PvP aspect would be fine and in the same breath saying you can't ignore the existenz is something I don't understand.

You make good points why the physical game is a success. But I don't agree with the other points. The LCG is for people who don't want to compete with someone else. And the LCG wants to offer this. Sure there will be more people who want to play HS and the DLCG, but go for HS. 
I don't know how much money FFG makes with the digital game and I don't know how much they need to make. An other example: For Honor, it had disappointing results, but got supported and is still alive today. Sure no hit or CoD/Battlefield, but not everything can become a mass phaenomenon. I expect the same fate for the DLCG. Also if FFI doesn't make it work, their first game was a bust. Not really what you want image wise.

LotR LCG doesn't make a good job making itself look different from HS, especially to outsiders. It lost it uniqueness when they decided to dumb it down. And it's obviously not LCG players they are trying to please with what they're doing, hence all the dumbing down going on to cater to the "wider" audience, which is too preocupied playing HS and other digital card games.

I'll rephrase: "You may ignore the pvp aspect, but you can't ignore that this game exists as a persistent alternative available whenever the subjects want it, and unlike tabletop competitive card games, it doesn't require a live opponent nearby to play, hence rendering all the advantages and enticement tabletop LotR had nonexistent for the digital LotR".

But do people want it? Witcher, a very well known and loved franchise with the very well known and loved Gwent card game released a solo card game spinoff Thronebreaker, a fully fledged polished game with plenty of content, and even they admitted it didn't did as well as they expected it to be. LotR LCG has no name on PC, doesn't distinguish itselff enuff from other games, takes a lot of money for virtually no content. For Honor failed because at one point they were pay to win which is like a self-signed death sentence, but they still alive because at core it's a very good and engaging game that buried itself early and now tries to crawl out. 

I don't see any good outcome of what is LotR DCG rite nao. It succeeds - they think dumbing down tabletop stuff is ok and we never see any proper port of anything. They don't succeed - they are scared off the digital realm and either withdraw entirely or start doing even less risky and more dumbed down stuff. And in case you didn't know, LotR DCG currently holds 50 or less people playing it on steam per day. Games with such low online are considered dead.

There's no way the digital game survives long enough to grow to the same extent on current showing. Initial reception of the product has been very different to that of the core tabletop, and it's a very different marketplace with waaay more competition.

It's a shame. Had the potential to be far better than the original with a decent library of player cards and quests. But no one will be playing it in 2021 when they might have that in place.

This is a little rambly, but...

While I can certainly appreciate the desire to defend the online version, trying to justify why it's not competing with everything else out there is obviously misplaced.  Trying to argue that there will be more content, or that you can't judge the game now, is obviously misplaced.

Why?  Because the numbers don't lie.  You can type until your fingers fall off about why there's no comparison, but actual players obviously ARE comparing, and are finding it lacking.

IMHO the problem is that in the computer space, when you're talking about solo play experiences card games are very, very limited compared to what else is out there.  The value proposition for the previous model put the price point about the same as a major AAA game title like Assassin's Creed.  You've got to have something REALLY strong to compete with that.

So who are you going to attract?  People who really like card games.  And of those, people who really like solo games.  And of those, people who aren't already happy in one of the many other options out there.  And of those, people who will look at the content and think it's not a massive ripoff.

You can't compare the price point of the physical and digital versions because that's not how people think.  When you put something physical in their hands, it inherently increases their estimation of the value compared to software, even if the software costs dramatically more to produce.  That's just the way it is.

But really, all the justifying in the world about how awesome it is and you can't compare this or expect that is just tilting at windmills.  At this point it seems pretty obvious that the game's a big miss with players, and tweaking the sales model isn't going to change that.

Overall I agree with you but I'll always caution anyone who says numbers don't lie. They can be among the most misleading things in existence and that's not counting the ability of the people/systems giving you the numbers to lie. In particular, it's worth noting that a short singleplayer game will not have a high concurrent player count no matter how worthwhile or not it was for however long it lasted. 

 

 I don't play the digital anymore and I imagine most players who have, including the players who love the game don't play it all that much, simply because they've already beaten it. It's not even challenging enough to warrant replaying much.  Although not many people are playing now, it's quite conceivable that were people not running out of content to play or where feeling sufficiently challenged that the content they had lasted longer that a whole lot more people would still be playing.

 

I feel more inclined to defend the potential of the game than the actual game. I still firmly believe that with the same basic ideas/systems they have here they could make an amazingly satisfying and challenging game.  I have to admit though, I don't actually see the game taking this trajectory.  I stopped back in to try this supposedly extremely difficult challenge scenario they released and I beat it on hard on my first try with a perfect score. I feel that this is somewhat telling of some deeper issues with the design. In theory if I was incredibly enthused about it I could intentionally give myself handicaps to make it more interesting but even then that's not the way I personally like to play. I don't feel it's my job to make the game challenging.  There are a few other philosophical choices throughout the design I simply find baffling. Honestly though, even with all decisions I consider poor design, I would still find this game quite defend-able if there was simply more content and harder content. That said, it isn't there. And due to their strange priorities, it doesn't look like it's going to be there anywhere near in time.

 

As for who it'd appeal to, hard to say given what is there now. But I would point out that there are plenty of people out there like me who simply like challenging strategy games and don't particularly care whether the challenge comes from another player or an AI with an unfair advantage so long as it is possible to think your way to an advantage of your own.  This doesn't take a complex system or a good AI. I like card games as I find that deck building tends to allow for a decent amount of depth and expression.

Yes, the nature of the game is one that will lend itself to a lower concurrent player count.  But that doesn't mean that it's meaningless.  Trends can be especially important, because it's only comparing the game to itself.  What's the trend for LOTR?  A pretty big spike when it initially went early access, and then it fell off a cliff.  It's not really hard to interpret that - the initial hype and advertising got the attention of a number of players who were excited to try it, but it didn't stick with many of them.  Why didn't it stick?  Lack of content is definitely an issue, but the question then is can they produce content fast enough to keep people playing?  It went to EA on Aug 28.  The 29th shows 290 players.  Two weeks later it's at about 70.  Losing 75% of the players in two weeks is pretty awful.  If 75% of your players get bored with the content in less than two weeks and leave, how much content do you have to produce to keep them playing?  Is there any realistic possibility of doing so?  Now it's peaking in the 20s, though it did get a nice spike from the new announcement - almost back to the "Only lost 75%" mark, but not quite.

The other component to the drop (or not) is new players.  Even if your players only stay active for 2 weeks, if you're bringing in new people at an equal rate to replace them your numbers don't drop.  It looks like the initial hype, likely driven largely by existent physical players, got the bulk of the people it was going to get.

So yes, there are caveats in the numbers.  It's certainly more complicated than simply citing a number and saying you're right.  But none of the numbers we have are consistent with the game being well-received, either by new players or by the people who should have been the most excited about it.

Agreed with the above, if the online LCG fails to capture and hold onto the paper lcg players, the chances of it being successful is slim to none.  It needs them and that part of the game community has spoken loud and clear, the answer is no, this is what the numbers show and though I agree that numbers are not conclusive evidence , there is no other evidence of any kind to suggest anything otherwise.

That said there is still time for the devs to deal with the reality of their enterprise and make adjustments but to this point there attitude suggests they are moving forward with the game as planned in a defiant act of willful ignorance, the situation has all the makings of an indie developer about to learn a hard lesson in listening to their community.

Latest 24 hour peak is 30.

I'm one of the cardboard players and while I wish this had the depth of the tabletop, I still think the digital edition is 'okay' -ish right now, despite the lack of content. Right now, since it is so dumbed down, it feels like a game I'd piddle with on my phone or iPad rather than my tower. I don't see myself ever dipping into expansions for the digital edition.
