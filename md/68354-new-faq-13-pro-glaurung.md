Well, new FAQ posted, both Beravor and Protector of Lorien getting nerfed.

I think Zigil MIner got the biggest shaft.  Only max of two resources now; neither of which are guarnteed even if you have Imaldris Stargazer.  And you're still losing the top two cards

 Thanks for the heads up. Plenty to digest here, but I will just observe that POL isn't nerfed that hard - the restriction is per phase not per round, so you can still get a +9 WP boost in time to take effect when questing is resolved.

I note also that some previous rulings have been reversed, eg on Lost and Alone (hero is not dead for any purposes including player elimination).

 Well, my primary deck used to pretty heavily rely on beravor, Protector of Lorien and Zigil Miner, so I'm sad to see them get a power-down, but on the other hand…they probably did need it. Ah well, glad I moved to a glorfindel/frodo/aragorn deck and a dwarf deck recently!

## 6 [impaulm on July 31, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68354-new-faq-13-pro-glaurung/?do=findComment&comment=666646)

 Well there goes some of my strategy too… I think these changes are smart and make sense. With a couple Zigil Miners you can still take in a lot of resources, and Will of the West and Stargazer prevent any really needed to cards to be discarded, or at lest unavailable.

It's actually nice to see Beravor evened-out some. Bilbo gets a little more powerful.

JJeagle means that you discard three during the resource phase, another three during the planning phase and then the last three at the beginning of the quest phase.

I think that someone at Fantasy Flight is tearing his or her hair out right now.

Indeed:

Action: Discard a card from your hand to give attached hero +1 Defense or +1 Willpower until the end of the phase.

However, it now becomes useful to add a second or even a third PoL on the same hero.

Well we all saw the ziggy nurf coming form the day it was spoiled… Ot is a very very heavy nurf though… going from pulling a max of 18 a turn (witch was just bonkers) (3x Ziggy+ stargazer) to each card pulling a max of 2 and more than likely 1 resource… … even I think that is a little harsh.

at 1 resource Ziggy is not nurff'd.. but executed.. no one will ever use him.. his only real function now is to thin your deck into the graveyard and there are many other cards that do this a lot better. I am all for card adjustment.. but this ISN'T fixing the card.. it is just making it completely irrelevent as if it was nvr printed in the first place..

Ziggy was a disgrace to game design when it was made and this "fix" is just as sloppy … extremely disappoint.

Beravor.. well we all wanted this and it is here… I agree completely…

Protector.. well with out Beravor this card is not really as silly.. but I see nothing wrong.. +3 for 3 cards isn't bad at all still and not stupid.. this is how you fix a card… (see ziggy rant)

Enemy attacking outside of combat phase has no change to how I play.. but yes.. if yo ufollow the rules strict it used to mean no shadow card.. common sense made this a non-issue. but good to see it confirmed.

All in all this is a really good rules update.. apart form ziggy… They needed to do it as the new treasure cards are obiously needing a rule re-rwrite.. "we want a new card.. lets change the base rules to allow it.." I'll let that thinking speak for itself… … .

The only thing I really missed was that I think the Range Attack ordering to allow the same character to untap and attack the same character twice needs to be affirmed and the rules spelt out.. and I would also have like more explicit rullings on attachments and how the yare paid and who controls them,… (see the argument over black orcs and tentical attachments)

Still all in all good update.. well done FFG..

Two unneeded errata, and Zigil Miner getting hit way harder then it had to. Neat.  Not to mention that it's game over if one of the player controlling the Dol Guldr captive loses his other heroes, but you're still in the game if the only hero you have left is Lost and Alone? And it looks like shadow cards from attacks outside of combat phase stay around.  All in all, I'm very disappointed.

Eh, I don't know about that. Additional resources are always good. FFG designed a deck around Love of Tales, for goodness' sake. It'll take more thoughtful deck construction, and possibly a few more recursion cards like Erebor Hammersmith, but I think Zigil Miner can still have a place if you aren't running leadership. One or two additional resources every round is still a helpful effect.

i never used him, either, but he still has his uses. while the article about the FAQ might have been trying to smooth things over when they stated, "it now adds up to a maximum of two resources per use, keeping it more in line with other cards that provide resource acceleration," it doesn't make him useless. you still have an ally, should you need him for other things, otherwise, you can still generate resources on par with other resource generation engines in the game.

what gets me is how they didn't realize how broken this would get in the first place? is any play testing done, whatsoever? some of the other cards i can understand but Ziggy looked broken from the outset.

for A Game of Thrones LCG, they do if they reprint the expansion, otherwise, I'm not aware of any pure reprints. I don't think most gaming companies do this (of course, some do).

Yeah, I'm very frustrated and disappointed with shadow cards staying around as well as having to still resolve an attack from an enemy that was returned to the staging area. Seriously? I can't attack an enemy in the staging area except by card effects, why should "disengaged" enemies get the privilege? And Zigil Miner  was cut at the knees. He's still around, but much less effective.

This isn't what the new rule adjustment is saying. If you push a card into the staging area, then it dose not attack. All this rule is saying is that if teh card makes a legal atatck out side of the combat step.. say thoug the use of Ambush, then it is also delt a shadow card.. just like a normal attack.

Golden_Nightingale said:

Well not really.. I mean ANY card can be used.. but the question is .. is it of any use.. will it evr see play over anything else.. Like Dark Knowledge.. sure you can use it.. but dose anyone use it? Ziggy has been so baldly stuffed that it is now a completely irrelevant card that no one will ever use. They had a ton of options… even a strait up banning would have been better than what they did. They still haven't made a "restricted" list so they could have started there, they could have made it a single copy a deck, they could have made him unique so only one goes on the table. They could have done a lot of things to "fix" this card..

Think about what this card dose now.. it discards 2 cards to gain at the most 2 resources, and in all truth most likely you will only ever be pulling 1. With SoG, Resourceful, the other resource engines and not even counting the Hero and Song splash cards.. why would ANYONE ever play this card now.. 1 resource is just no worth it. It has discard sure, but when you stack that vs the new "draw a card" leadership guy or the 2 discard to block / attack allies… well again.. if your looking for a discard effect… there are better options.

Ziggy wasn't fixed… he was simple made unplayable.. they ****** up twice with this guy…  really terrible.

Unneeded errata? The Beravor + Protector of Lorien + Unexpected courage combination was obviously broken.  the win-loss ratio of decks built around that engine was way to high.

 I think they should've compromised with Ziggy, and let him give the player 2 resources if one of the discarded cards you correctly named had a listed cost of 2 or higher. As it is now, BOTH discarded cards have to have the same cost to get 2 resources. I think I may house rule it using my compromise idea.

I welcome all these changes. I use Ziggy myself, but not his ability, as my decks consists mostly of low cost cards. The guy can give you 2 WP for a cost of 2 resources, if you have Dain, and there are only few spirit dwarfs to play. I think he is still worth his money, and his ability can help in crucial momants, like when you really need to play some card combos, but you lack one resource to do it. I mean how often did I sit there with four resources and front of me and Gandalf in my hand?

## 34 [HilariousPete on August 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68354-new-faq-13-pro-glaurung/?do=findComment&comment=666850)

I also like all the errata, including that of Zigil Miner. He still can be used (combo with Gildor or Stargazer) to create 1 or more probably 2 resources. Even if you don't use such combos, if you know your deck well, chances are good that you get 1 res. And this is just the value it should be. Leadership is the sphere which should excell on resouce generation. Not Spirit. The combos with Zigil were better than Steward of Gondor. Now Zigil is more like Horn of Gondor: a nice addition, but not as good as the card of the sphere which focuses on that theme. (And spirit has got more of such cards: Ancient Mathom is IMO the best non-hero card to make you draw cards. It should be in the Lore sphere. And Stargazer manipulates the draw deck. It should be in the Lore sphere too, like Gildor.) Zigil is still a good character (cost 2, every stat 1) and with Dain he's even better.

## 35 [Emrad on August 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68354-new-faq-13-pro-glaurung/?do=findComment&comment=666860)

I don't really understand all this rage about the new game text of Zigil Miner.

Sure it comes from Totally Broken Land and goes down to a blue Steward of Gondor, but it's still way enough to want to play it. Stargazer + 2 Zigil Miner will still consistently provide 3-4 ressources per turn, plus making some cards accessible in the graveyard without drawing them.

With all that, you still have a ally body that can quest, and a great one if Dain is play… if that's your definition of "unplayable", you sure have high standards of card playbility :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

you can consistently pull 1 a turn, to pull 2 you need to have two cards in a a row with the same value… this is at a cost of 2 card discards. This is unplayable imo.. as yes yo u"can" play him.. like you can play any card.. like you can say play dark knowledge… but no one ever will.

> Zigil is still a good character (cost 2, every stat 1) and with Dain he's even better.

The comments about him as a 2:1/1/1 have nothing to do with this conversation. If your running him as a quester with Dain or w/e then you are NOT using his ability you are talking about completely ignoring his ability.. How is this not killing the card?

Because it was heavily overpowered and now it's "only" a standard card. Better than Wandering Took, better than WRT, better than Lórien Guide. This is perhaps how the card was supposed to be - otherwise his stats would have been 0/0/1. A player only uses his ability if he desperatly needs moe resources - that's how I played him even before the errata.

In some of my solo decks, I've chosen to play Leadership only because of Steward of Gondor. The errata'd version of Zigil in combination if Stargazer provides an alternative. You can modify 5 cards with Stargazer. Chances are good that you have 2 cards with matching costs. The cost of discarding 2 isn't that high - either you have some cards granting you additional draws (then you'll want to have Will of the West anyway) or you don't, and then you usually see only half of your player card deck, and some additional discarding doesn't matter.

Additionally, you have to keep some characters ready and not quest with them because you don't know if and how many enemies will be added to the staging area. And when no enemy is added, you sit on your ready characters. With Zigil Miner, you cna keep a character with 1 or 2 attack strength in reserve, and if he isn't needed, you can use him to  generate resources.

His stats have to do with this conversation. When talking about "killing a card", everything has to be considered. Zigil Miner is 1 card. With its stats AND text box.

If Dain is in play, I still prefer Zigil Miner over West Road Traveller, because he has equal cost and equal willpower strength. But additionally, he has 2 attack strength, has his ability to help me when resources are needed, and has the Dwarf trait (Legacy of Durin, Lure of Moria etc.).

And when no enemy is added, you sit on your ready characters. With Zigil Miner, you cna keep a character with 1 or 2 attack strength in reserve, and if he isn't needed, you can use him to  generate resources.

I think this is really bad thinking. Your talking about discarding 2 cards for an effect that requires a 2nd card to function properly. So in stargazers case you are sacrificing a 2 drop and then neither stargazer or ziggy can quest to be able to use his effect and then you are saying you need to cycle your entire discard pile back into your deck to get back all those cards that you lost though ziggy.  That is stupid expensive in relation to SoG or Resourceful or Gloin etc etc.

The comments about him as a 2:1/1/1 have nothing to do with this conversation. If your running him as a quester with Dain or w/e then you are NOT using his ability you are talking about completely ignoring his ability.. How is this not killing the card?

 

 

His stats have to do with this conversation. When talking about "killing a card", everything has to be considered. Zigil Miner is 1 card. With its stats AND text box.

If Dain is in play, I still prefer Zigil Miner over West Road Traveller, because he has equal cost and equal willpower strength. But additionally, he has 2 attack strength, has his ability to help me when resources are needed, and has the Dwarf trait (Legacy of Durin, Lure of Moria etc.).



no they do not have anything to do with it. ANY card can be played as a body to be used as a blocker or a small quester.. Keen Eyed Took for example.. can be played like this.. BUT it is the card ability that makes it unique and decides if a card has value to a deck construction idea. We are talking about his ability not his function as a blocker or an ally as this hasn't been changed at all. You could compleatly blank his text box and what you are saying would still be true. No one is saying that his "body" has chnaged and become worthless.. we are talking about his ability

Comparing Zigil Miner to Dark Knowledge, that indeed has nothing to do with this conversation.

Saying that in addition to a nerfed resource-generating engine you also still have a decent ally body, that is perfectly relevant.

not really.. my comparison was just to illustrate that there are cards in the game and that is one of them were the effect has no meaning as there are cards witch make it redundant or its cost makes it not viable.

Your right though… Keen Eyed Took is the more "correct" example.

 As a weaker player, I needed all the help I could get. Even with a massive card draw deck and UC on Beravor, I couldn't consistently win with PoL. Zigil Miner was also one that I only used occasionally and to little effect, seeing as I had no peeking cards available to me. To me, these changes just made a hard game even harder and I'm not happy about it. I'm totally with Booored in regards to Zigil Miner. I didn't even get chance to use him properly. I agree with jingmelingpa (sp?) who said that making him take two resources if one of the cards matched the named number.

At the end of the day, there's no tournament and I can play how I want, but the game will always have the bitter taste of either "well it used to be played like this" or "well I still play it this way, even though it's technically wrong now." I guess experienced CCGers have been dealing with errata for years, but it's really turning me off.

EDIT: I like how Rule Clarification 1.10 still refers to unlimited PoL action in the same document where they errata'ed that card. Is that an oversight, or is it to show consistency between FAQs?

Cool cool. Agree with everything. Pol, Beravur and Zigy get what they deserve.

I use to play Baravur with this errata already for last 6 months anyway.

Agree with Pol too. Now this combo is broke and game will be more interesting.

What about new Glorifindel? threat value 5? Is crazy powerful too! I think he will get his correction when tourny system come.

i hope not -some cards are meant to be powerful - glorfindel isnt broke….he's just an interesting take on a hero. if we start throwing cards down the drain justs because they are more powerful than others, then whats the point in playing at all?

the whole point of glorfindel is his low threat….get rid of that and you have a handsome fella with a sword- nothing more

i would be very dissapointed if they errated glorfindel

 I decided to put my cards where my mouth was. I built a deck that incorporated Beravor, Unexpected Courage, Zigil Miner, and Protector of Lorien. The idea was to build it as I would before this new FAQ. Then I played Passage Through Mirkwood using the new errata. Granted, this is supposed to be a fairly easy scenario. I got two PoL on Frodo, but never needed to discard more than three cards. I never got UC out, so Beravor only ever used her ability once per round anyway. I got Zigil Miner out on the very last round but had Steward of Gondor anyway so didn't need Zigil Miner's resources. So basically, none of the new changes affected my game at all. It's probably different for more advanced scenarios, but considering I hardly ever use Lore anyway, this FAQ isn't really going to affect me as much as I complained it would.

And I realized that Gildor Inglorian gives me peeking abilities to use in combo with Zigil Miner, so I was wrong about that too.

(1.27) Bypass the active location
The only time an active location does not act as a buffer for progress to be placed on a quest is when card text specifically instructs the players to “bypass” the active location.

 

So it mean when i have a tool and exhaust a hero to put token on the quest card(Flight from Moria quest) if there is a active location token will be placed on  active location? Right?

Yes. Unless the card explicitly bypass, Current Location always "soaks" Progress.

In your case the quest card explicitely states "Exhaust a hero to put a progress token on Escape from Darkness". There's no much room for interpretation here. The golden rule applies and the card text overrules the lack of the "bypass" keyword. So no, the progress token would be placed on the quest card. Note that this is not about "progress" or "quest cards" in general, but specifically about "Escape from Darkness".

I played last night and I still think Zigil Miner can be super powerful, especially when combo'ed with Stargazer or Gildor. When using 3 copies of unique cards that you want out fast, like Vilinor, Asfaloth, Vilya etc, Miner can plow those extras out of your deck once you have them already. He can sift the deck and give one or two resources a turn doing so. If you take one Miner, Beravor, and your standard draw, that is going through five cards a turn. You might not have them all in your hand but the cards you need are there, most likely with enough resources to pay for them.

I find this to be pretty nice.

Okay, now I am a bit confused myself, as "Makeshift Passage" (TWitW) which is works similar as "Abandoned Tools" includes the phrase "bypassing any active location".

Can someone explain the new ruling on action windows during the quest phase?  I always thought you could play events and take actions prior to committing characters to quest ala the green area in the rule book. 



I believe the intent of the update was to reinforce the Turn Sequence charts in the rulebook.  As you accurately noted, there is a player action window at the beginning of the Quest Phase in the Turn Sequence charts.  However, the language in the rulebook (Pg. 14) stated that a player could "take actions and play event cards at the end of each step."  The new language simply reflects the way everyone has been playing it all along.

Yeah, I'm very frustrated and disappointed with shadow cards staying around as well as having to still resolve an attack from an enemy that was returned to the staging area. Seriously? I can't attack an enemy in the staging area except by card effects, why should "disengaged" enemies get the privilege?

 

This isn't what the new rule adjustment is saying. If you push a card into the staging area, then it dose not attack. All this rule is saying is that if teh card makes a legal atatck out side of the combat step.. say thoug the use of Ambush, then it is also delt a shadow card.. just like a normal attack.



The best way to look at it is that if the attack is initiated, it will resolve, regardless of where the enemy ends-up being located. The key will be to use displacement cards (like ALitD) after engagement checks are made and before shadow cards are dealt.

Thanks for clearing that.

That means it's better to keep locations in the staging area.
