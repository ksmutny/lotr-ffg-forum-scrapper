We have seen spoiled already several permanent boon titles that will stay with the hero throughout campaign mode. Do you think there will also be boon attachments such as armor and weapons (reminiscent of Hobbit treasures)? I definitely think Sting would be an awesome boon card.

 

With all of these permanent boon attachments, the heroes are going to get pretty buffed out pretty quickly through the campaigns. That suggests that burdens will have to balance out these "level ups" or the quests will have to get increasingly difficult (or a combination of both).

I hope Sting and all those cool objects will be attachments so we can use them in other scenarios.

i agree, i hope that most are saved for real cards, otherwise we lose a key point where it would be perfect to release a card, rather than in a random one in a later AP

 

personally i was a little dissapointed that we didnt get the items on the treasure cards as real cards

 

as for the balancing, it depends how numerous boons/burdens are....have ffg actually said? i dont feel there will be all that many, just enough to signify key events in the books...though by mordor we may be a little 'heavy' with burdens haha

I feel you on wanting to play with some of these iconic weapons in other APs. So you think any of the boon cards will be weapon/armor attachments?

i dont think i'd like if they gave us weapon or armor attachments, i think it'll be more in the vein of general attachments.  or at least i'm hoping, mostly because the hobbit attachments like glamdring and orcist were both restricted which kind of throws off deck assembly if you need certain attachments on characters.  and like everyone else i would want to use awesome items like anduril on quests outside the saga expansions

i would also want less epic attatchments as real attatchments. sort of like the real early feel of the books, such as pipes, walking sticks and so on. pretty much like spare cloak.

We got hobbit cloak, we have also good meal and second breakfast, and I sure hope we'll have Barrow-blades.
