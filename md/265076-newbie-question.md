Is there a set that involves The Dead Men of Dunharrow? I find them awesome but they don't seem to get a lot of attention....

There's a scenario in the Flame of the West scenario pack called the Forbidden Door which involves them. I've never played it so can't review it.

There's also a standalone ("print on demand") adventure called the Stone of Erech which involves the Dead Men. I have played this and can tell you that it's excellent. One of the best created actually.  

Hope that helps!

Huh?

The quest is called Passing of the Grey Company. I've no idea where you got 'The Forbidden Door' from.

Quest card 1 in Passing of the Grey Company is called The Forbidden Door, so I suppose that is where it comes from. As to the quality of Passing of the Grey Company, I have played it twice and don't remember much about it, so I guess it is probably an average quality quest.

Apologies I checked Hall of Beorn and got the wrong quest name. It is definitely in the Flame of the West saga though.

If you're playing in campaign mode then you have the chance to earn the Army of the Dead boon, which is an obective ally you then have with you for the following quest.

The answer lies in playing the "Passing of the Grey Company" quest.

Edit - answer provided above.
