Do the scenarios/expansion scenarios come with difficulty ratings? If so, is they any way to know the ratings before buying expansions?

Are there any expansions that should be left alone if you want to play solo?

the ones up until the most recent do- but they are useless and are not worth finding out. here is a rough guide….also non should be avoided solo, i have managed them all, but i would say return to mirkwood is certainly not a fun solo quest. (you need to be patient to play this game solo…and be winning to lose during the process of getting better at it) also remember that all quests vary in difficulty depending on how many players you have - here are the solo diff ratings that i think:

Easy:

emyn muil

dead marshes

hunt for gollum

the long dark

Medium:

conflict at the carrock (though gets easier when you figure out the 'win formula'

foundations of stone

redhorn gate

watcher in the water

the first two of the khazad dum quests

the middle hobbit quest

Hard:

journey to rhosgobel

return to mirkwood

last of the khazad dum quests (though can be really easy at times)

road to rivendell (because of 1 card…sleeping sentry)

the 1st and 3rd hobbit quests

shadow and flame (though with hama and feint it gets easier)

 

rich
