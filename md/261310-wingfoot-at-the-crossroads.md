Wingfoot:  Attach to a Ranger hero. Response: After attached hero commits to a quest, name enemy, location, or treachery. If a card of the named type is revealed during this quest phase, ready attached hero.

My question is about using the card on the Journey to the Crossroads quest.  On this quest at the beginning of the quest phase you reveal an enemy from under The Crossroads.  Now say I exhaust my ranger hero naming enemy.  During this quest phase an enemy has been revealed, so do I effectively ready immediately?

How are you going to commit to the quest before the beginning of the quest reveal?

According to the wording as I read it, I don't have to:

1.  An enemy is revealed from under The Crossroads.

2.  I commit the ranger hero to the quest naming 'enemy'.

3.  The named card type has been revealed during this quest phase.  I ready the hero.

It's the funny wording of the second sentence of Wingfoot that makes this awkward but possible.  (I think.)

I don't think it would work here.  Your hypothesis is that the "If a card of the named type is revealed..." clause is a binary yes/no.  And therefore, if it has already become a "yes", you would be able to ready the attached hero.

That's a plausible interpretation, but would be contrary to the standard response-based interpretation that would allow Eleanor/Merry to ready multiple times.  I don't think both of those scenarios can simultaneously exist.

That the point. Wingfoot work this way: when you reveal the named type you ready. Since you have reveal it before to go to the quest it is too late for ready?

The point is that you can either read the second sentence as if (i.e. yes/no) or as when (i.e. a response to a trigger).  If you read it as if, then Bullroarer Took's scenario would be valid.  If you read it as when, that would allow you to ready Merry/Eleanor more than once.  Both scenarios can't be true at the same time because they are different interpretations.

The card literally says "if" which is why I said it's plausible that you could retroactively consider enemies that were revealed.  But, thus far, the community has played it the other way.

Maybe responses do not have retroactive effect

I think it has to be effectively a response to newly-revealed cards because the other interpretation doesn't specify a time when the readying happens. If it were truly a passive effect that, once a specified card type has been revealed, constantly readies the character every time it's exhausted, then you'd be able to use some character powers infinitely which is obviously not going to be right. And it isn't a once-only effect because I think it has been clarified in the past that Ranger Eleanor can cancel multiple treacheries per round with Wingfoot.
