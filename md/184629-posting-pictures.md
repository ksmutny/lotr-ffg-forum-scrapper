Had a few pictures I thought I might post to the forums, but can't figure out how to do it. Is a way this can be done?

I upload them to my Facebook account as private images (so only I can see them), then copy the image into the forum, using Copy Image from the rightclick menu. There's probably an easier method but that's how I do it.

Thanks, I will try that.

 

Looks like your pictures are custom-designed cards for a campaign mode of the Against the Shadow cycle. Those look really cool.

That was my Shadows Over Gondor expansion I designed not too long ago. The overview thread is here (https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177568-shadows-over-gondor-custom-campaign-pack/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177568-shadows-over-gondor-custom-campaign-pack/]). I made OCTGN materials for it if you're interested.
