After discarding a hero to the Great Bridge, does the Balrog also lose Archery 4 and/or Regenerate 4 if he has Fiery Whip and/or Flaming Sword attached?

Because the Great Bridge doesn't mention they have to be a printed keyword, I'd say yes. But the attachments themselves would remain attached and The Balrog would still get the attack or defense boost.

Thank you! That's what I thought... I just always prefer to clarify!
