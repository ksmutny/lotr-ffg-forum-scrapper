Just to make sure I'm playing right:

 

I can defend with more than one Hero and/or Characters against an single Enemy I am engaged with, but if there is damage, ONE of the Heroes or Characters must take ALL of the damage inflicted??

 

for cards that read literally Pay X to get...something, like an ally from the discard pile, that X is whatever number I determine it to be? then I take say that ally for the COST that I alone determine??

 

Is this right?

Only 1 character(hero or ally) can defend against 1 enemy.  There is 1 card called Stand Together that lets you defend with multiple characters.

 

For bringing allies back with Stand and Fight, you have to pay the ally cards cost, so bringing back a Northern Tracker to you hand would cost 4.  X is generally defined on the card.

You can defend with only one character, you can defend with two or more only by using cards (I don't remember how is it called, it's tactics event).

You mean Stand and fight! card? You determine the cost, e. g. you pay 1 resource to play one-cost ally, or 2 resource to play 2 cost ally...

You can attack with multiples though.
