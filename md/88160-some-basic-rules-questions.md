 1. If an Enemy engages a player, is it still considered to be in the Staging Area? Will contribute its Threat the next time the players quest?
    
     

 2. Do Location texts (for instance "Players cannot receive resources from card effects") apply as long as the card is in play, or only if it is in the Staging Area?
    
     

 3. Do Enemy texts apply as long as the card is in play, or only until it engages a player?

1. no. once engaged it doesnt contribute threat next round

2. it depends on the location. some say 'whilst in the staging area' some say 'after you travel to X' and some have nothing

if its nothing then it means in play, i.e everywhere until you explore it

3. as above it depends on what it says. usually its safe to assume that if it doesnt specifically say then its all the time until you kill them
