# [Solo House Rules - Semi-official list?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59594-solo-house-rules-semi-official-list/)

Some of the quests seem very difficult to pull off solo, especially if you only have 1 core set. 

I'm wondering if there is (or can be created) a semi-official list of quest-specific  "house rules" which could help solo players have a success rate equivalent to 2-player.

First we'd need to find out what the success rates "should" be for each quest when played 2-player.  We'd probably want to consider 3 classes of players: newbies (10 or fewer games), intermediates (10-100), and experts (100+).  Or something like that.  Then we would need to rate each quest in terms of the average success rates for each class of player when played 2-player.

For example, considering the core set quests when played with 3 players, we could find out some stats like this:

Quest 1 - newbies win 50%, intermediates win 80%, experts win 95%
Quest 2 - newbies win 15%, intermediates win 50%, experts win 70%
Quest 3 - newbies win 5%, intermediates win 20%, experts win 50%

Then we'd find out what the stats are for solo play.

And then we'd come up with rules that would bring the solo stats up on part with the 2-player difficulty.

Has anyone taken this approach before?  Anyone interested in proposing a list of solo tweaks that we can start trying out?

hi

i neither agree with house ruling or find the need to change solo play, however i would probably point you in the direction of boardgamegeek.com if you havnt already, i think they have a special downloads section for varients so you may have more luck there

the problem i see with you plan is that most solo players either

1.already play with thier own house rules or

2. find solo play fine

so it may be difficult to find people to do the neccesary calculations you need

also the 2nd difficulty has to regards with my recent post on player opinions on difficulty- for instance i have played well over 100games- i would condsider myself well versed in the games rules and methods- however i do not have a good win rate, for reason which can be seen in my thread on this forum. there are also others in my position.

likewise there are intermediates who have a greater win rate than people like me, so overall it may prove difficult to figure these things out

I read somewhere that there is a file containing "Optional Solo Rules" somewhere. 

Do you know where that is?

 Yeah man; indeed, solo play is hard in many scenarios (harder than multi-player, but I still just try.  Gives me a great challenge. If I want the game to be easier then I play with other people.  Just some thoughts.
