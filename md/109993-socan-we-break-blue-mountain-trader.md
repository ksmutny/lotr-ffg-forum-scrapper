# [So...can we break Blue Mountain Trader ?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109993-socan-we-break-blue-mountain-trader/)

Anyone else think this card must be broken in some yet-to-be-discovered way ?
 

The closest I can get is the following :

 

Pass to player with horn of gondor equipped.

He gives you a resource and passes trader back.

You discard it which triggers the horn.

 

Use stand and fight to get it back again ? Repeat ?

 

Admittedly this isn't quite there yet (it's zero balancing up to the stand and fight part, after which you are one resource down), but something along these lines ?

 

Do your best !

As it have been pointed out endlessly here, he just lets you rearrange all your resources as you wish. Works best with cards like Lay of Nimrodel, Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire.

Or as someone on the BGG has mentioned - bounce him between players to buff Harbor Master's defense to absurd numbers.

Stop this nonsense, it does not works that way. Add and move is two different terms, and moving resources does not triggers harbor master.

Sounds like what a grumpy old man says. :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png]

 

 

Blue mountain trader costs 2 however.  So even if you do discard him and trigger horn, the players as a group are still down one resource.  He can arrange resources quite nicely on the table.  So what?  It's a nice ability but when you compare it to other cards like asfaloth, Steward of Gondor, Faramir, ect., its not amazingly powerful.  Rearranging resources does not seem super game breaking to me.  At the end of the game, in fact at the end of most planning phases, usually the player(s)

have spent most of their resources,  I usually build my decks in a way so I don't end up saying "darnit! I have all these resources on Aragorn but none on Legolas!"  I design decks so I will be able to pay for the cards in my hand just fine.(dont we all?)  I think blue mountain trader is a handy little fellow, but rearranging resources, rearranges resources, it doesn't win the game.  

 

I might be wrong though...

Still better than spreading lies about trader triggering harbor master.

 

The problem with trader is that one player can go monospirit and all other can even go trisphere without any multisphere mechanics and they will always have required amount of resources of required sphere any time trader is present. And thats some serious sheet.

I can see a potential problem in multiplayer if a person plays Steward of Gondor on a character and other resource enhancements. I am sure at one time or another we have had a hero who simply has 10-15 resources on him with nothing to spend it on. The trader would be a VERY powerful card to allow the character to disperse his excess onto the other players in a single round which would be an extremely powerful effect. Maybe not 'broken' but really strong.

To move a resource, it needs to be removed from one pool and added to another.  I haven't seen an official ruling on this, but I know it works this way for damage.  Damage moved is damage added and dealt.

 

So, I'm pretty sure Harbor Master is pretty much X defense while BMT is in play (X is equal to whatever number you can think up).

Well, it's not like there are a lot more other topic that adress the "move ressource" ruling with official answer from Caleb :

 

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1044315/harbor-master-and-errand-rider [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1044315/harbor-master-and-errand-rider] is one of them.

 

Or you can use the search function at the top of the forum.

 

That being said, stop spreading false rumor, it has been denied early when the ally was spoiled.

 

I was thinking about posting a large post about blue mountain trader, like I did for desesperate alliance (http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1033236/desperate-alliance-underestimate-combo-card [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1033236/desperate-alliance-underestimate-combo-card]) because there is a lot of things possible with him !

Blood of Gondor, Gondorian Fire, Lay of Nimrodel, Hirluin, Elrond, Desesperate Alliance, Steed of the March, Ellandan, Elrohir, Parting Gifts, Gaining Strengh, Boromir II, Visionary Leadership, Gloin I, Aragorn I, Balin, Hail of Stone, and my special Nor Am I a Stranger/Mutual Accord/Sword of Morthond where you can add Ever My Heart Rise, Ring Mail, Dwarrowdelf Axe.

That's should be most of them.

 

 

EDIT : Oh, I see why there is so much post for this nonsense now : http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1196970/resolved-1000-defense-harbor-master [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1196970/resolved-1000-defense-harbor-master] with yet anothers official response from Caleb...

No offense to Caleb (He's still the man), but this answer is a stretch at best.  It feels like it's straight out of left field.  Oh well, I'll add that to the list and roll with it.  Might I recommend a LotR LCG dictionary to be published alongside the FAQ?  Harbor Master is crying silently over this one too.  He almost had his big break...

Well, while there was situations where I could say this, but not in this situations. His arguements are pretty reasonable, and I can't see how they're "stretch" at all in this case. Harbor master is still strong, and with future resource adding stuff (and I'm sure there will be), he'll grow even stronger.
