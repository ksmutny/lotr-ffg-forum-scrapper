It may be a dumb question, but this cards gave me some thought. I'm a Brazilian player, using the translated cards from portuguese release from Galápagos Games. The Objective Gollum says, in it's original text:

 

"Damage from undefended attacks against you must be dealt to Gollum."

 

In our Portuguese version, it says something like "Damage from undefended attacks against THE PLAYERS must be dealt to Gollum." I mean, they used plural on this phrase.

 

Since in English the word "you" can be used both for one person or more, singular or plural, I ask: that effect is suffered in any undefended attack, or only the player guarding Gollum?

 

Don't know iof I made myself clear: in a 2-player game, Player 1 is guarding Gollum. Player 2 is attacked and do not defend. That damage goes to Gollum? Or only if an attack against Player 1 (which is guarding Gollum in this example) is undefended?

I've always played it that "you" means the player guarding Gollum -- so only undefended attacks against the player guarding Gollum would result in undefended damage going on Gollum.
