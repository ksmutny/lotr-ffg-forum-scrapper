So we get 'limited edition' Star Wars sleeves pre- launch of the game itself...but are now waiting over 9 months for the LOTR related LCG sleeves.

I understand marketing decisions...has there been a manufacturing issue perhaps?

Or is this FFG making a shrewd ploy to cash in on the current Star Wars hype post release of Star Wars The Old Republic MMO and upcoming release of their games (and assuming there is a bigger Star Wars consumer demographic than LOTR).

Hmmmm...

Come on FFG, give us an explanation!
