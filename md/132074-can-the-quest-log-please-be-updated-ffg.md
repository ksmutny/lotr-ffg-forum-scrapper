This is getting pretty stupid now, I JUST got my hands on Anterlered Crown yesterday because I live in Australia and I've just gone on to the quest log to log my single game and victory and I can't because it isn't on the quest log yet even though its been several weeks since it was released.

The Old Forest also got released as a POD quest a fair while ago, Fog on the Barrow Downs was just released as a POD. Can we PLEASE have these two quests as well? People want to log their entire saga experience and those two quests are part of the saga. 

I bet Erkenbrand hasn't been added either which is ridiculous because people probably want to play old quests with him but can't.

Log it on the paper while you're waiting.

I'm so far behind on the quests that I don't tend to run into trying a quest that doesn't exist. But I do run into using heroes that aren't up there. The way I generally handle that is to put duplicate heroes in the log (For example, I put Legolas, Haldir, Haldir, when I had a Legolas, Haldir, Galadriel deck and Galadriel wasn't released) and then I write a note about who the duplicate is supposed to be. When the hero is released, I go back through my logs looking for duplicate hero pictures and edit them.
