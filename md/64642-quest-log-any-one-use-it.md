Just got into LoTR LCG and love the online quest log, any one else use it?

Yes, but mostly for solo-play because the possibility to log multiplayergames is really impractical.

I use it. Gives me a nice way to keep track of high scores and successful builds. I don't think it's particularly helpful as a comparative tool, but it's quite handy for gauging your own progress.

 I used it when I first started playing, but the extra time it took just wasn't worth the minimal benefits I felt I was getting from logging my quests. Especially because you need to log all losses to really make the comparison statistics valid, which is a really pain in the neck.

Thanks for the Request Doom,

As a side note, I just got into LotR(LCG) , so this was really cool to see.

Gives me a good reason tro come here whenever I play, I have it bookmarked on my i-pad, so when i finish a game, just drop in and post.

I've been using it for all my games.  I don't worry so much about the results of having multiple people in my multiplayer games, I assume that as more people play and record, the results will move towards their 'expected' values anyway.

I use it. The only major drawback is that it does not take into account your failures so there's no real reason to post those.

I keep a seperate spreadsheet to keep track of my win/loss ratios

Feel free to add me!

 I use it, but only post my wins.  I'm only really interested in what high score I have achieved and which Heroes I used to do it.

 I use it to keep track of my improvement, or the other way round, every time I finish a game.

 After a few days i had tracked all my games, 11 loss 3 win. 

I realize tracking losses does not help at all.

So im only tracking wins now.

 I know that this is a bit late, but I am new to the game as well and one of the main reasons why I started looking at the forums was because of the Quest logger. Feel free to add me!

I have used it since getting the game and find it useful for keeping track of what quest I have completed. Feel free to add me.

 I used it a whole bunch when I was playing a whole mess of solo games while my wife was out of the country. Now I just add something occasionally.

Used it a few times. Got bored serio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/serio.gif]

I log every quest, no matter if win or loss. Maybe FFG will improve the log one day (haha) so we have some useful statistics.

 

Everyone may feel free to add me

 I don't use it - too much trouble for not enough functionality.

(also, this wasn't a rules question…)

 I use it, feel free to add me ;-)

 I just started using it… some notes:

 

1. It doesn't ask for all the data it probably should, like number of rounds, etc.

2. It doesn't let you see other people's scores… it'd be nice to see how you did in a scenario compared to the average, or compared to the best, etc.  I realize it's an honor system right now, but it'd be nice to see some averages, at least.

3. When playing with more than one player, it doesn't care about the other players… just you.  So if you win a scenario with two other people, you're just entering it for yourself… if your friends want their scores entered, they have to do it themselves.  This is good/bad… you can get something entered with one person, but if all three enter the same game, it probably looks like three different games to the system.

Still, the idea is strong, and I can see the potential in it… just needs a little more development.

I just came to the forums to open a thread about this. Instead let me give this a little *push*.

It's a shame to see the potential wasted.
