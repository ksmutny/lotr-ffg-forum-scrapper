Guess Thranduil will have to wait for a while. Also, does FFG have a fetish with non-canon Lore silvan elves?

Fetish ****, you know? I like to bind, I like to be bound...

 

Wow, that's some strange-ass ability over there. Does he reduces the enemy's threat by his attack and discards the enemy if it's threat reaches 0? Seems too crazy to be true. Or he has really low base attack. Looks more like he deals damage to that enemy if it's threat is reduced to 0.

I hope that they have Magali do the art for Thranduil when he gets a card. He deserves Magali and not that Skyrim-Santa stuff that the Spirit Theoden artist was on. In my opinion, the art for this game is generally good, but has gone all over the place, from absolutely amazing to borderline bad. I hope they give Thranduil to Magali.

I find all of the non-Magali art presented to be quite awesome and fitting the theme more than Magali's because it's rough, while Magali's art is somewhat "polished" and "soft", always being handsome.

The art on Stasis is cool.

 

How about we go back to discussing Argalad though?

I'm guessing his ability deals damage (or discards?) an enemy in the staging area based on his attack strength.  Reminds me a lot of Haldir.  I'm already scheming a deck with him and Haldir that uses Keeping Count.  Haldir racks up a few kills, then Argalad starts one-shotting enemies (and doesn't add resources to his copy of Keeping Count).

based on what can be seen, seems it says he can target enemies in play (not just staging area)

I thought about that and concluded that it would be unnecessary/redundant to include "in play" (because you can't target cards that aren't in play), so therefore it would have to be "in the staging area".  But I guess they do typically include that phrase, like on Gandalf.  If it's any enemy, this could be quite strong.

I mean, I don't think "in the staging area" fits in the space that can't be seen in the card text

I think it could fit.

 

Action: Exhaust

the staging area

Here's my guess:

 

Action: Exhaust Argalad to choose an enemy in

the staging area. Until the end of the phase, that

enemy gets -X [T], where X is Argalad's [A].

If this reduces the enemy's [T] to 0, deal

Y damage to that enemy (Limit once per round).

 

I'm guessing Y is 1 or 2.  But it could be X, which would be pretty bonkers.

If you change "the" to "a" it makes it line up better from line one to two, but would be weird if it could target enemies in other people's staging areas :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Currently any card we have that can discard an enemy specifies that it must be a non-unique enemy (Straight Shot, Helm Helm, O Elbereth). In the case of O Elbereth the "non-unique" was added afterward by errata because of how broken it was (you could just discard the Balrog from play, etc). So I highly doubt the ability will allow you to discard or auto-destroy the enemy.

We also see that "the" on line 4 lines up with "Limit" on line 5. I am trying to make it work but it's not fitting right:

 

Action: Exhaust Argalad to choose an enemy in
the staging area. Until the end of the phase, that
enemy gets -X tttt, where X is Argalad's aaa. 
If this effect reduces the enemy's tttt to 0, deal 1
damage to the enemy. (Limit once per round).

 

On the other hand....

 

Action: Exhaust Argalad to choose an enemy in 
the staging area. Until the end of the phase, that
enemy gets -X tttt, where X is Argalad's aaa. 
If this effect reduces the enemy's tttt to 0, deal 1
damage to Argalad. (Limit once per round).

Hmm, you might be onto something.  That would be pretty disappointing, but maybe that would be more balanced.  The ability basically gives Argalad the option to battle quest with him and the ability to commit him to the quest after staging.  That's nothing to sneeze at.  Damage to him would prevent him from getting out of hand.

 

But if that is his ability, he might go straight in the bike spokes.  Although it also depends on his stats.  So much speculation...

Also, he is Silvan, the people of Lembas and Silvan Tracker, so it's not like there wouldn't be ways of mitigating the drawback. I think everyone likes direct damage to enemies, but it does seem like it'd be mighty powerful to have it in an inbuilt hero ability in combination with Thalin... I guess we'll see!

If he indeed does have high attack and can reduce an enemy's threat, he'll be a great replacement for Haldir in a thematic silvan deck.

The fact that he has to exhaust to do it means his other stats (will and defense) are relatively meaningless.  He isn't questing if you are keeping him standing to use his ability, and to make his ability worth it his attack has to be higher than his will power. 

 

Of all the elf heroes, only Legolas has a WP of 1.  Due to Argalad's ability, I can see him being a 1 WP.   Maybe sharing stats with Legolas completely: 1/3/1/4 with 9 threat.  

 

Or maybe they don't want his starting STR to be that high, so he is another 2/2/2/4 10 threat.   (I really hope not).

 

I really want a 0/3/0/4 with 7 threat (or 0/2/1/4) to make different secrecy decks than hobbits!

It's possible his ability does something to the enemy that is beyond strong and his base attack is 0.  So his ability would be useless until you attached weapons to him, but once you did, he'd be stronger than most heroes kind of thing.

The trouble is his ability of negating threat is only marginally better than just questing for that amount in the first place.   It has the exact same outcome.   This just allows you to decide to do it after cards are revealed.   Which is handy for sure, but if his STR is worth anything, then you'll likely want him to be standing to help kill said enemy instead of just neutralizing his threat.

 

Granted, it does give you options.  which is better than just over questing.    I'm still hoping for lower than a 9 threat wise.

So,if I'm not wrong there are already ( including Argalad ) 4x Lore Silvan Heroes, 1x Tactic Silvan Hero, 1x Leadership Hero and 0x Spirit Silvan Heroes.

I know you agree it's good, but I wanted to emphasize: I have found the ability to adjustaquest really great in a wide variety of scenarios, primarily for tempo control. I've had many a quest where Galadriel's draw/threat lowering ability was actually quite secondary to her role as 4 willpower only-when-needed (once Nenya is available). Same for Eowyn's power.

So, no matter what the rest of his text says, I'm stoked about this Argalad character, especially for multiplayer, when staging becomes really likely to reveal a new enemy. I'm guessing it's going to be 2 for the ATK stat. 1/2/1/4?

I'm excited about Entangling Nets.  Seems generally more useful than Ithilien Pit, and it's another trap that could help the Dunedain stay engaged with enemies.  Not to mention more Straight Shot shenanigans.

Maybe the first trap that actually combines well with other traps (Ithilien Pit, Ambush).  Beorn and his Bear Trap are excited about some nets.

I was pretty certain the hero would be Thranduil. Now that it isn't, it would make perfect sense to have him in Leadership. So he may still arrive this cycle if we get two more Silvan heroes within the packs (unlikely but possible). Strange we haven't seen him yet, really.

Or they are waiting for the next cycle, which would take place in Mirkwood and north-east of ME in general

I think Thranduil will make his first appearance in the deluxe box that focuses on Silvan, which will probably be next.

True, no deluxe was about Silvan, after we have had Dwarves, Gondor, Rohan, Dúnedain and Noldor (broadly speaking); however, Silvan right now is probably the most developed trait in the game. Still, I wouldn't mind… I like them a lot. And I now want Thranduil Leadership -- and very different from Celeborn, which I am sure he will be (the latter I mean).

I loves me some Silvans, but they're already such a powerful archetype. I wonder how they could be seriously developed a la a deluxe/associated cycle while avoiding power creep.

Yes, silvan seems to powerful for now. I think the next deluxe expansion and cycle is in Dale, and maybe Mirkwood. Do we have any silvan allies in the enters play synergy who is from Mirkwood? No, everyone is from the Galadhrim Realm. Which means that maybe Thranduil starts a new silvan strategy for he Mirkwood ones.

Remember that the final pack in each cycle has featured a big time iconic character who ends up being pretty powerful: Dain, Elrond, Theoden, Erkenbrand, and Arwen. Theoden is clearly the weakest in game, but he is a major player in the lore. I think there is still real possibility that Thranduil is released in the final pack.

> Magali is overrated. Great, but overrated. There, I finally said it.

 

Man, I agree that this game is graced by many excellent artists (and for those who rush to condemn T. Baracchi  on the grounds of Spirit Theoden: you 're unfair; he's great) apart from Magali. Her husband, Al. Dainche for instance is equally talented, yet no praise is heard of him.

 

On the other hand, calling someone overrated, while sporting her art on your avatar at the same time, is a serious contradiction on your behalf.

How is it a contradiction? I, for one, enjoy Magali's art as the next guy, but she recieves so much praise here that I indeed agree she is being overrated. She's good, but not that good to worship her as some people do. And overrated doesn't means bad, or even not good, overrated means rated above it's actual value. It's not a sinister term.

I would argue that you underrate her sir.  get on our level and then you wouldn't think she is over rated.  Just appropriately rated.     I do agree with Serazu, there are plenty of other artists that do great but as far as consistency goes (and my awareness of who they actually are), Magali sets the bar.  She is definitely the only artist that I actually remember the name of though, mainly because of conversations at Covenant about this games art and Megali and the heroes she's done.

How is it contradictory? I never said her art is bad, nor did I say that I dislike her art. On the contrary, I like most of the stuff the puts out (including the elven brothers). But her fanboys here seem to act like (a) all the best artwork in this game comes from her, and (b) every piece of art she makes is the best, both of which are not true. They seem dazzled by the fact that a piece of digital art can have golden light shining through things (leaves, hair, clothes), dramatic poses, pretty faces and photorealisitc textures. Guess what, those things are actually not that incredible. Do I like her art? Sure, I still think she's one of the best artists in this game. Is she overrated by the community? For sure.

And there you have it. It's the community and the developers that hype her up. Or do you think she chose to illustrate the majority of the heroes (mainly females and elves)? Obviously not. I long for the day that we see a hero illustrated by Owen William Weber or Illich Henriquez, but so long as players and the art director keep hyping her up, all of our female and elven heroes will be illustrated by Magali.

I don't really think she is overrated.  The reason she gets mentioned so much is because her art is consistently good.  Just because something gets mentioned a lot does not make it overrated.  It's possible it warrants it.

 

Really, how you rate something is completely and entirely subjective so the discussion as to whether her art is overrated or not is sort of silly.  Some will think she is overrated, some will think she is underrated, and some will think she is appropriately rated.

@Openthwindowpane - the trouble with your choice of words is it doesn't get the words "the" and "Limit" to line up like they are on the card.  Damage to Argalad does.

No one working on this game actually cares about the contents of the books, if they've read them at all.

There is one reason I wouldn't mind him damaging himself -- the fact it wouldn't make me want to boost his attack, which is hard to do in a Tactics less deck I am imaging Argalad in (with Celeborn and Galadriel). Also, it would mean that his attack is actually higher to begin with, my guess would be 3, and that again would fit great within the deck in mind.

Finally, there is a space between the traits and text, right, so we can expect Argalad to be ranged. If all these are correct, I imagine him to be one willpower and one threat lower version of Haldir, or same threat with 1/3/2 -- making total sense to leave him out of questing.

It would have been a thematic disappointment not to deal with Corsairs from Umbar in this game.  Pirates may not be stereotypical "high fantasy", but they're absolutely canonical.

The Lord of the Rings isn't a civilisation. It is a novel. A novel in which travelling over the sea is essentially a one-way ticket and otherwise forbidden by literal god-figures.

Passing over the sea, the call of the sea, the arrival of hope/doom by sea etc. are all strong recurring thematic elements in the narrative. To append a sea-faring adventure on treasure island to the IP is to reveal a complete lack of respect for the source material.

The game is called Lord of the Rings, but it's not actually restricted to what have been in the novel, but rather to the universe in which the novel existed, which included pirates and stuff.

The Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings are novels set in a civilization imagined by Tolkien to provide a background for his invented languages.  The Lord of the Rings game is set in this civilization, and except for the saga expansions are explicitly not set in the novels.  FFG also has a right to use material from the appendices, though sadly not the Silmarillion.

 

The one-way ticket you refer to is only relevant to completely crossing the sea to seek the undying lands (after they were removed from the circles of the world). There is no prohibition at all against traveling by boat in the sea, and we know from the text that the Corsairs (i.e. Pirates) of Umbar did so.  We also know from the Council of Elrond that after Elrond said they could not send the ring over the sea (i.e. on a one way trip), Glorfindel counseled to "cast it into the deeps", Gandalf responded that "There are many things in the deep waters; and seas and lands may change."  Both Galdor and Elrond add that Sauron would expect them to go that way -- clearly, a sailing to trip to "the deeps" was plausible.

 

Moving to the appendices we know that both elves and men sailed east as well as west before the fall of Numenor, and that the Numenoreans were particularly notable for their sea power.  But even after the fall, the Corsairs were not the only ones to sail on the sea.  Cirdan attempted to rescue Arvedui by ship, and in the shipwreck that followed he wrote "even the mariners of Cirdan were helpless", implying that the mariners were highly skilled, impossible if their sailing was confined to one-way trips overseas.  The kingdom of Gondor was also naval-minded, Tarannon was the first of the ship kings who built navies, Earnil I built a great navy and took Umbar, which withstood a seige of many years "because of the sea-power of Gondor", and at Gondor's peak strength they ruled the coast all the way to Umbar, with the kings of Harad doing homage.  In the civil war Castamir took the fleets and established the Corsairs of Umbar, but we know that the Corsairs were not the only one that subsequently sailed, because from then until Aragorn's time they were "a threat to its coastlands and all traffic on the sea", an odd description indeed if traffic on the sea was forbidden by the Valar and not practiced except for one-way elven trips.

 

In Telumehtar's time Gondor acquired sufficient naval strength to storm Umbar and kill Castamir's descendants, though it was soon lost again during the wainrider crisis.  Against the witch-king, Gondor's army was sent north under Earnur with a mighty fleet, "so great in draught and many were his ships that they could scarcely find harbourage, though both the Harlond and the Forlond also were filled."

 

Between the Hobbit and the LOTR (i.e. the very time period of the game), Thorongil [Aragorn] was "a great leader of men, by land or by sea".  His final action for Gondor was a raid on Umbar with a small fleet for a night attack, burning many ships and personally slaying the Captain of the Haven on the quays before withdrawing his fleet "with small loss".  A night attack by ship requires substantial nautical skill, and losing ships in the retreat requires battle with ships.

 

We know also from "the fleet with black sails" that the ships of Umbar possessed sails as well as oars, and the free men of Pelargir using the Corsair fleet had sufficient skill to use the western wind to come quickly to the fields of Pellenor.

 

In fairness, after the fall of Numenor there's little evidence of sea traffic away from the coasts, but given the geography there's no practical reason to expect it -- there were no longer any accessible lands that required leaving the coast, excepting the elves' one-way trips.  But that's a function of geography, not a Valar ban on the high seas or the lack of the ability to do so.  Cirdan's mariners obviously had to be capable of high sea voyages, and Gondor and Umbar alike were descendants of a people which had routinely sailed across the high seas in both directions.  We've already seen that Earnur's armada included ships of great draught, and that the Corsairs had masted ships with sails.  At Pelargir the Corsairs main fleet included "fifty great ships", according to Gimli, to go with innumerable lesser ships.

 

Long story short, the world of the Lord of the Rings was absolutely, positively, peopled by those who had the skill and technology for high seas journeys, should they have a reason to do so.  Even if you confine yourselves to the text of LOTR only, and there's no reason why you should, the sea-longing is restricted to elves, the one-way journeys are restricted to the elves, and the ban of the Valar only applies to crossing the sea completely, not traveling in it.  Meanwhile, pirates (corsairs) are most certainly present, and have great masted ships that employ sails.  Further, the Silmarillion says that after the destruction some Dunedain believed that its summit remained above the water as an island and some would even sail to try to find it.  This is perfectly in line with the premise for the new cycle.

 

You are free not to like the theme of the new cycle, but please stop claiming it "reveals a complete lack of respect for the source material."  It is firmly grounded in the source material, which has pirates, ocean-capable ships, sailing, and even legends of surviving bits of Numenor poking out of the water.  Exploring the world of Middle Earth is supposed to be one of the reasons for the games existence, and I'm happy to see that the creators did not let some silly prejudice against pirates keep them from exploring an interesting part of Middle Earth.

Its not disrespectful if everything ties in with the lore as close as possible...

we know for a fact that the corsairs of umbar are still a very real problem in the third age, hell Aragorn and co, the Grey Company and the Oathbreakers take out a fleet in the books we just don't get many details about it....

 

we also know that numenor sank but there are mountain peaks that survived.... there could very well be temples and ruins on those islands....

 

ooop was going to write more but the previous post just appeared and is far more informative and thought out than anything I would have written so basically the above post!

Cirdan returned from the other side. How "one-way" could the trip be?

> Cirdan returned from the other side. How "one-way" could the trip be?

Cirdan never went to Valinor. None of the Teleri who went to Valinor left again as I recall, with the possible exception of the War of Wrath. While some who went to Valinor returned in the First Age, and Glorfindel returned presumably in the Second Age after his heroic sacrifice at the Fall of Gondolin, the trip is very clearly one-way by the time of the Third Age, with the exception of Gandalf's resurrection.

 

The more pertinent point however is that the trip to Valinor is only one of many possible voyages across the sea, as dalestephenson just explained at length.

If i remember correctly, the Telleri of Valinor did not take part on War of Wrath, only Noldor and some Vanyar (it is Vanyars only "trip" on middle earth after they left for Valinor during the year of the trees)

I think that everyone who has ever read "The Silmarillion", "Unfinished Tales" and "The Book of Lost Tales" will agree with you Dalestephenson ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I just want to add that there are also "The Western Isles" off the coast of Lindon. They are:

 

- Tol Himling ( also known as Himring ) - which was the realm of Maedhros [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Maedhros], the eldest son of Fëanor [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/F%C3%ABanor] during the First Age in Beleriand.

 

- Tol Fuin -( Isle of Night ) - It was originally the land of Taur-nu-Fuin ( lands full of dread, evil spirits and orcs who served Sauron during First Age ) but only it's highest parts survived destruction of Beleriand. It was mentioned that during the Second Age there used to be a small Numenorean colony but after the isle was abandoned.

 

- Tol Morwen - One of the few locations in Beleriand which was not drowned, it was the site of the Stone of the Hapless [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Stone_of_the_Hapless] and the grave of Morwen Eledhwen [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Morwen]. Mariners of Númenor [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/N%C3%BAmenor] and later Arnor [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Arnor] visited it on their voyages to pay respect to the hero Túrin Turambar [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/T%C3%BArin_Turambar] buried there.

 

My point is that we are still waiting for any news about two more adventure packs in the Dream-chaser cycle so I wouldn't be surprised if they used any of these Isles in their pack ^^

Start with reading Sillmarillion , then Unfinished tales and then lost tales. You will discover a new world and some of the greates heroes in Tolkien world like Feanor, Turgon, Turin, Finrod, Beren, Luthien and my most loved one ... Fingolfin.

Also some great enemis that will make Smaug or Shelob to look like puppets

I take it no one else has noticed that Argalad means "without radiance"...

(Also, Fingolfin is a B.A.)

Yes...

Turgon, Fingolfin, Echtilion, Rog (only in lost tales) and Azaghal is some of my favouties. Oh, and Voronwe of course.

 

Read the Silmarillin! It´s great!

Prior to reading your post, I kind of agreed that this new cycle wasn't for me. Not that it was bad or irreverent, just that the pirate theme was a little out of the realm of why I like LOTR. But you have changed my mind.

And yes -- I have read the Silmarillion and all those subsequent canonical works. But I guess the maritime stuff didn't stick with me excepting Arvedui's loss in the Ice Bay of Forochel. Thank you very much for compiling that information. Well done!

@PocketWraith: I think Thingol (Elwe?) is the only one who had seen Valinor and returned (except for the Noldor who came back).
He set out to lead the elves (together with Finwe and 1 other whose names escape me) but he got lost along the way and fell in love with Melian, the Maia ....

Man, I think I'll go read the Silmarillion for the x-th time. 

Cirdan vowed to keep the Havens there so that any Elf could always sail west. I'm not sure but I recall he even wants to leave on the last ship west.

If I remember well, Thingol was one of the ambassadors that went to Valinor, saw what it was like and returned to convinced the other elves to travel there.

 

When the migration started he was leading a large group of Teleri who went on a slow pace and lost Tol Eressea and eventually decided to stay in Beleriad than wait for it again to return to carry them

Where are new pack spoilers? 

 

By the way, I had that really stupid dream. In my dream, a neutral version of Aragorn got released, he had 3wp,4atk,2def and 5health, and there were five resource icons printed IN HIS TEXT BOX, fifth one being NEUTRAL :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

One of the weirdest dreams I had prolly.

Neutral Aragorn's resources can be used to pay for spirit/Lore events, leadership allies, tactics weapons and armor, and Mounts of any sphere.

Finally got to spend some time in The Drowned Ruins.  An interesting quest that encourages turtling and lots of allies.  And lots of willpower.  I did challenge me before I realized that because you start with so much threat in the staging area and your tendency is to try to gain control of the staging area ASAP.  Then you realize that's not really possible.   So I think that there is something of a 'trick' to this one and once you realize it the difficulty drops.  Still I am all for the two sided locations which definitely add an interesting twist.
