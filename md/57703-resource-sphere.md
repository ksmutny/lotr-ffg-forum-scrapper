 So when you attach a card like Song of Kings  do you get and extra resource during the refresh phase??

 

I am thinking no, but just wanted to double check.

No, you still only get one resource, but you can now spend that hero's resources to pay for cards from two spheres (original and Leadership from Song of Kings IIRC).
