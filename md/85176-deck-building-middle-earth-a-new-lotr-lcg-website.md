Hello,

i am posting on behalf of a gamer friend who has spent several weeks coming up with a new website centered around deck building in the Lord of The Rings LCG.

It will be regularly updated as the new packs come out, and is designed to not only give newcomers to the game help in coming up with deck ideas, but also help struggling veterens in building new decks that make the best use of the current card pool. It uses an innovative method of deck ratings to give clear advice on how best to approach deck-building strategies.

Here is the link

Thanks for linking, Rich!

 

I''ve only got some time to skim through the site. Looks promising, and I'm anxious to see the offered decks. My only complaint so far is the font which makes some of the texts hard to read (or I am getting old).

I agree with leptokurt about the font.  Good website though!!

Your pointless rant has hardly been missed on this site. So why don't you keep to your beloved cardgamedb. I actually go there to see the pictures of the cards that didn't reach my store yet, and I am thankful for that, but otherwise the site has little to no content as towards the strategy and deckbuilding. And I don't think I'm in a minority there since I hardly see any comments posted on the site… criminally un-populated perhaps for a reason?

Rant -yes, unhelpful - yes, pointless - dunno. I truly wished that booored would take the time to dress his words in more polite clothes so people would actually listen to what he has to say.  I think he is right though that bloggers could reach a bigger audience if they shared a general forum where players can find them.

Yeah. "Booored" is quite good at using offensive, and what often appears to be egocentric comments towards other players. However, he does often make some valid points through all that pessimism. 

The site looks good; good work! Though, I do agree with others here that the font is very hard to read in places. The letter "e" appears as an "o," and the number three, though I can tell is there, is hard to decipher.

I could also use a better language, of course. And I wasn't here to defend the page or anything, I just find quite a few "new" stuff in there that isn't on cardgamedb. I think that sentence about it having "all that stuff" was completely off.

Boored, if your going to say something like that, dont say anything at all.   Cardgame db is only good for the pictures of cards.  You dont know what your talking about buddy.

And it seems the font issue has been fixed now. Looks much better.

Agreed. Boored can sound bad but he always look on the deep of root. Comand guys we all different to each other from different countries so there is some different expresion from different people.

Very usefull and interesting for a new player like me. Helped a lot to bring new ideas for my games.

 

Though I disagree with some of the authors comments ( I do not find Erebor Battle Master that bad) and also I believe some others are missing (Veteran of Naduhirion is not mentioned while it is a good attacking card imo) , I really liked it and will continue reading it anytime I need some tips and ideas !!!

Added a feadreader on my browser, I hope it works cause I have never used something like it and I'm not sure I made it right

great- hopefully it should work. have you managed to subscribe using the button now? if so another test update can be put on so you can see if it works

PS- thanks for commenting on the website itself, im not the author, i only help with some of the website aspects, so the author will be replying to you soon :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

A test update is on my feed so I guess it is working. Thanks. But shouldn't the feed also let me know when there are new posts (like the authors answer to my comment)

## 23 [richsabre on June 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85176-deck-building-middle-earth-a-new-lotr-lcg-website/?do=findComment&comment=805654)

great. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

unfortunatly it wont as the website doesnt support feed updates on anything but blog posts. therefore when the author posts new content, they will release a blog post saying 'new update' just for the purpose of letting subscribers know the actual site has been updated and what, and where

its a bit of strange way to do things i know, but most of these sites are designed around blog hosting, not a fully functioning website

thanks for setting the feedreader up, it seems like it should work now, but this thread will be updated at the start anyways, so you will have some indication of whether its working or not

UPDATE #2 New Solo deck - The Scout

http://lordoftheringslcg.weebly.com/the-scout.html [http://lordoftheringslcg.weebly.com/the-scout.html]

This deck is meant for solo play, and it uses elements from (or is a solo alternative to) the Wanderer which is mostly meant for cooperation with other decks (the Scout and the Wanderer cannot play together due to Glorfindel featuring in both). The main strength of the deck comes off the encounter deck manipulation.
Denethor has grown tired of Elrond and other Elven Lords always having their merry social gatherings and never inviting him; and he decided to have a council of his own. At the time he wasn’t particularly keen on large cooperation, since others would usually only thwart his schemes. Thus he had to work in secrecy. He also wanted to keep things out of the family for a change but he took advantage of his son Boromir having had previously made friends with Glorfindel. The Elf has been highly renowned and Denethor was in desperate want for such alliances. To make the party all the more cheerful, the Steward of Gondor invited a Silvan lass Mirlonde, renowned more for her looks rather than her skills. Though Denethor wanted to make things private, he couldn’t prevent Gandalf from sneaking in for some free drinks, which is why he usually showed up in the White City despite his pretences of giving (ill-news) advice and shedding (weird) light on foreign affairs. The number of guests (to Denethor’s fright) has grown over night as many were trying to take advantage of Gondor’s hospitality. Most of the usual suspects were present: the notorious Henamarth Riversong, the ever dreamy Gléowine, a couple of Mirkwood Runners, very thirsty from all that running with messages, they couldn’t wait to part with Thranduil’s authoritative rule; and even two Silvan Refugees were let in for a bowl of hot soup. In the end, the skinny Elves together with Ithilien Trackers (having had long suffered from Faramir’s cruel herbal diet) have pillaged many a pantry before the night grew old. Arwen was sent as her father’s spy but her presence was a bit undermined. And Glorfindel brought with him his two pals in mischief, the infamous feast crashers Haldir and Gildor. And when even the Elven smiths got dizzy from all the Southern wine (quite unlike the clear liquid they were used to been served in Imladris after closing hours), Wardens of Healing had to be called for, long before a battle was begun.

Love the site Rich really cool!

I like th eCategories you have listed and like the idea behind each deack so far.

Suggestion (you probably allready thought about it but just in case):

Wouldn't it be cool to use those categories to "rate" each Scenario?

How important is this and that category in this or that scenario, like.

That would be an awesome strategy help for deck-builders.

Thanks and Great work!

Thanks ghostwolf- that is a great idea! i shall pass along your compliments and idea to the author, and we shall see about getting up a scenario table with ratings

My pleasure. You could even take this a step further, with the category-ranking system you could then match Deck you create to Scenarios where the "should" excell, and what scenarios to stay away from or what to beware of when you play them.

UPDATE #3

quest strategy guide subsection 'The Quest Begins'

http://lordoftheringslcg.weebly.com/the-quest-begins.html [http://lordoftheringslcg.weebly.com/the-quest-begins.html]

thanks to Ghostwolf's suggestion a new section has been added that gives players strategy advice on selected quests. So far there is Journey Down The Anduin and Escape From Dol Guldur [http://lordoftheringslcg.weebly.com/the-warm-up.html]

"This is to provide players with basic strategy against some selected quests. The overall idea is not to build decks to defeat specific quests, but to have several decks ready and choose the appropriate when facing a scenario. Below are the quests in question and some ideas that should help one succeed. The detailed description of the quest will often try to touch upon all the strategic categories of deck-building.

The Warm-up
The Warm-up for the readers here consists of Journey Down the Anduin (solo) and Escape from Dol Guldur (coop). Dol Guldur solo is a strange quest design as it has a maximum of two heroes facing a minimum of four encounter cards on the first round of the game. It can be won but in the majority of the trials, a re-shuffle will be needed after a round or two (caused by the premature end of the game). Anduin coop, on the other hand, can become quite easy even for skilled begginers, using only the core set material."
