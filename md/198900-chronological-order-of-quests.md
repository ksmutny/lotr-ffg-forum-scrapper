# [Chronological order of quests?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198900-chronological-order-of-quests/)

Does anyone know what the chronological order of the quests are if you wanted to play them all in order, or at least know a link to someplace that does?

Pretty much order of their release.

Just look at the boardgamegeek page for the core set and it shows all the cycles in their order. The only wonky things are the release of the saga expansions but they are on a different timeline anyway and also follow order of release.

It could be important to know for someone playing progression mode of say, Fog on the Barrow Downs, precisely what cards were available at the time of release. Is there no such list of dates for each expansion?

This [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S-YTNTGxn_i1xSvzdD_vt2N7yWD2giQAn7TxR-dWHOk/edit#gid=0] is my own personal list, but I've listed it below as well.  The method for my listing is that (for the most part) I listed the date of its initial release as confirmed by the FFG News articles.  Initial release is defined as regular release OR (if applicable) GenCon/Fellowship Events.  I believe most of these dates are accurate, but feel free to correct anything.

 

Notes:

 

1. Regular

2. Saga Expansions

3. Nightmare (NM) (Regular)

4. Nightmare (NM) (Saga)

5. GenCon/Fellowship Event scenario release date

I made a google sheets link [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1S-YTNTGxn_i1xSvzdD_vt2N7yWD2giQAn7TxR-dWHOk/edit#gid=0] for prettier view but its not color coded or anything.  I made it so anyone can update it so hopefully it remains accurate.  I don't really have an intention of keeping it up to date.

Technically, The Hobbit quests (all 6 of them) happen about 60 years before the rest of the deluxe and adventure pack cycles (Which is set in the 19 years between Bilbo's birthday party and the start of LOTR), and which is then followed by the LOTR Saga boxes.

Do you mean chronological by order of release/publication, or chronological in the sense of when the quests would fit in Tolkien's timeline?

Yes, I mean in order of where they would have happened in the books.

Some people tried to figure that out a while back: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75663-play-chronology-quests-timeline/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75663-play-chronology-quests-timeline/]

 

Of course that doesn't account for more recent quests, but in the rulesheets IIRC it at least implies that the same group of heroes from Against the Shadow moved onto Rohan afterwards for Voice of Isengard/Ringmaker and then up into Arnor for Lost Realm/Angmar Awakened, so it's just a straight progression at that point.

Equally the speculation in that thread may not be in line with what the designers actually intended, but I don't think the designers have ever commented on exactly where in the 17 year period any specific quest is supposed to happen.
