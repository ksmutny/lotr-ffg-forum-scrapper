 No wonder I have been having such a hard time, facing the hill troll eight times and hummerhorns thrice should not happen in a normal game, huh?

I just realized I did that with the hill troll last week. Doh!

Yep the only time you shuffle victory cards back in is in the 'Nightmare Varient' and even then you only do so when resetting the encounter decks for each new quest.

I'm surprised you are getting through the whole encounter deck that often in the game in the first place - presumably you are playing spirit in there to keep your threat down and to regurgitate the player deck infinitely?

 I've never once kept track of victory points, so it was just recently that I also realized that I was doing the same thing.

(With a four player game, you can end up going through an encounter deck pretty quickly.)

I know, right. At first, I was having such a hard time accomplishing any of the levels, especially the second and third, but with the addition of some of the new cards and/or the help from my wife in cooperative games I managed to get through the levels. Next time it will be a bit easier though without the extra addition of the victory pointed cards.
