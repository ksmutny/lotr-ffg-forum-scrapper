So, I am currently trying to formulate one deck that can be played across the entire scenario existing story arc of the four quests thus far in the Hunt for Gollum. IE: THere will be no retuning of decks in between scenarios. Is there such a deck?

I have beaten (and am confident of beating on regular basis) all 4 expansion quest with a single deck. I shall provide it if you care.

 That's kind of a boring concept man...won't you get bored of it?

I have been working on a deck for the entire of the core quest line solo... I call it TRICORE. It can crush the 1st two quest with ease in solo mode, but I have yet to even try the 3rd quest yet. It only uses a single copy of core.

I am curious as to what this deck is.... and how many copies of core it needs.

I have been working on something similar. I am needing to buy my 3rd core to pull it off, as my main deck is all spirit rohan, but would love to see what you have come up with.

I've been running a Lore/Tactics deck (Glorfindel, Beravor, Legolas) pretty successfully through the first three scenarios

I'm doing the same thing for soloing Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.  In fact, I had a thread going a while ago asking if most folks build a primary deck (One Deck to Rule Them All - forget who should get credit for that phrase) to play through multiple scenarios or scenario specific decks.  The majority of respondents said one deck.  Maybe that just means that the type of person who builds a versatile deck to take on all comers is also the type that responds to forum questions...dunno.

Mine is Aragorn, Imrahil and Eowyn.  Aragorn and Imrahil have the versatility to fill multiple roles on the same turn.  Eowyn is a questing specialist.  I added Lore in to have a chance at JtR.

I beat HfG without fail, usually win CatC (~75%).  I've won HoEM the one time I've played it and expect to win it most of the time.  JtR is the tough one.  I've only won 3 times out of the ten - dozen I've played.  Really 2 as I missed that the pesky bats and birds can only be attacked by Ranged or Eagles in the first win...I somehow only picked up the defense constraint.  I hope to improve against JtR with some new cards in the next couple packs.  Come on Healing as a secondary theme in Leadership!

Durin - it certainly is NOT boring to play that way.  You have to build a deck  that can handle just about anything thrown at it.  You end up with less power combos and more thought in your play I believe.  Certainly it is fun to throw together different decks and try them against scenarios (I do that some too), but I prefer this challenge.  It's even harder with just one core set!

I'm hoping that FFG will introduce campaign rules that link the scenarios together better.  The results of one driving impacts in the other such as card availability, resources, etc.

 Yeah Woz, I suppose it really just depends on what you want to build.  I have my doubts though...especially with the JTR quest where you almost have to have a ranged hero. It would be interesting to see if we can come up with this deck, but once we do...then what?

I believe having all cards three times is what makes a difference. So yes, sadly, three core set gives you advantages. I think they should have had all cards thrice in the core, especially if they have them so later on.

I'm guessing this deck will struggle with the Journey to Rhosgobel quest? There isn't any Eagles or many Ranged people.

It looks like this quest will need a fairly specialised build to beat, particularly in Solo...

The Forest snare can trap the bats and flocks.

Given,,, but there are only three of them and the trick is how to draw into them reliably!

You forget about Haldir he is also Ranged + direct damage from Gandalf.
