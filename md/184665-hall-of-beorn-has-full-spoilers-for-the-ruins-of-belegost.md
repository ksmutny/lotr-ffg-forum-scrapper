There seems to be an error on all the quest cards...

 

It is always the same that shows up... All of them show the first part (1A, 2A, 2C, 3A, 3C, 3E, 4A) and not the other side....

 

 

Keep up the good work, Beorn

Reference to Aule, wow, is that even legal for FFG?

 

Anyway, thanks for this Dan, as always, and this quest looks like the best POD in a while (not a big fan of Barrow Downs sadly.)

 

Oh, and that gem! I want gems as player cards!

Yep, there was a bug handling the new C-D and E-F quest stages in this quest. This is fixed now.

Aule is mentioned in Appendix F of LOTR:

 

"...these are the descendants of the Naugrim of the Elder Days, in whose hearts still burns the ancient fire of Aule the Smith..."

 

Mine those appendices, FFG!

I am a big fan of first age ... i love it more than anything in Tolkien word ... Reading the name of Aule on a card, Morgoth as well as that of the three volcanos at Thangorodrim makes me soooooo happy :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] If there could be an attachment named after Azaghal would be perfect , **** those legal rights

Love the art, can't wait for it

That's a strange and interesting choice of enemy, given that all other enemies are regular orcs, goblins and trolls...

And it looks somewhat like a goblin with a dash of alien to me. Goblin, afflicted by the nameless virus? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

The term Nameless appears for creatures of old, a bit unknown to the outer middle earth that live mostly underground. Most of them live since the first age. I think in two towers Gandalf speaks of them at some point.

As for the orc, it looked female to me too, but if i remember correctly, orcs had no gender

Orcs have no gender? Is there a source for that? I always just assumed that female orcs were kept hidden as slaves in caves or working hand or something like that.

Let me look at it, basically I will look at the lotr wiki cause I have not with me the sillmarillion where I think there is a mention about that, but maybe I am completely wrong  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

EDIT: ok, from lotr wiki

 

> In The Silmarillion the wise Elves of Eressëa believed that Melkor had created the orcs before the First Age by breeding Elves he had captured and corrupted, by means of torture and mutilation. It's possible that female Orcs have the same appearance as male Orcs and thus few can tell them apart
> 
>  

 

 

So propably there were existed but were nearly the same. But  all were created by Melkor (and Sauron after), so no reproduction, that is what I remembered and though there were no female orcs  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Of course there were female orcs.

 

Silmarillion is both, History and Lore of Arda but from an elvish point of view. So elves thought orcs were made by Morgoth out of elves, but that does not mean they were right. Like in other similar chronicles when some fact is unknown because there are not witnesses the chronicler resort to legend to fill the emptiness. In this case elves tried to explain the origin of their enemies, an origin that had not verifiable explanation for them. They used the true fact that some of their kin were captured by Morgoth for sure, never to be seen, and linked this tragedy to the existence of the fallen creatures.

 

Tolkien discarded or tried to remake this previous idea about the elvish origin of the orcs though the legend remained as the official report after all. But orcs should be different beings with their own reproduction and of course, women. Indeed there are some scarce mentions to orc children in the books and notes by Tolkien.
