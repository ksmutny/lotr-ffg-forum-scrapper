Shortly: After i defend with a character which gets killed, can i defend again with other charecters against other enemies, or are the remaining attacks consired undefended?

You declare a defender for each attack separately as you choose to resolve it. If one of your defenders dies this makes no difference. (Unless hypothetically there was say a shaodw effect which said "If this attack destroys a character, the defending player cannot declare defenders until the end of the round." But no such effect exists)

So when a character gets killed while defending, were you always treating any remaining enemy attacks as undefended?  Man that would just blow you out of the water any time you chump block.

I bet you've gotten really, really good at defending! This game just became a lot easier for you.

Oh one question came up in my mind: If i defend with an ally example and then shadow card would kill that ally before resolving the attack, could i use another character to defend? I think i couldn't do so but i just want to be shure of this.

You can't... in that case, the attack would become undefended.

Like GrandSpleen said, there is no chance to declare a new defender. The steps for combat are:

 1. Choose an enemy
 2. Declare a defender
 3. Resolve shadow effects
 4. Determine combat damage

Once you resolve the shadow effect, the next step is determining damage, which will be undefended in this case.

I sense an opportunity for some cards:

 

Event:

Response: After a character defending an enemy attack dies when resolving a shadow effect, exhaust another character to have it replace the defeated character as defender.

 

For Ally/Hero

Response: Exhaust to replace (as defender) another character who has died when resolving a shadow effect while defending an enemy attack.

I once made a custom hero that said "Response: After an enemy's shadow card is revealed, exhaust [hero] to declare it as a defender against that enemy." It could replace the defender if it was killed or just work like Stand Together (both defending at the same time).

Or allow you to declare a defender when a shadow effect makes undefended suddenly not such a good idea.

There already extists allies that can take undeffended damage.
