Does anyone know the title (from FoTW rules insert)?What player cards do you think that will be?What scenarios?What mechanics? etc.

The Fires of Doom!

 

Ally Aragorn, Spirit Hero Eomer, lore hero gollum.

 

Shelob's lair, Battle at the gate, climing up doom and dropping the ring in.

We already have Shelob's Lair?  Battle at the Gate and Mt. Doom sound right and maybe Sam in the Tower rescuing Frodo.  Doubt we get Scouring but hopefully as a GenCon or gamenight quest.

Also if I recall correctly Gandalf says to the hobbits that the entire quest was training them for the scouring (or rather liberation) of the shire.  I think the movies dropped the ball here since this was the climax for the hobbits, so I do hope FFG includes it.

And now a serious post

I believe we will get Eomer hero, i find leadership more possible than Spirit

I cannot think of a second one right now, maybe Gwaihir hero would be an outsider

i have a crazy idea stuck in my mind though, Fellowship hero will be Sam with Frodo a kind of objective ally. I think it is more thematic and this way Sam will be included somehow since we got an ally version of him lately and after all he carried the ring for a while

Why Eomer?  Because to this point, if you play with core + saga, you have access to cards for every major character *except* Eomer.

## 15 [Noccus on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228555-last-saga-box-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=2384677)

Sam. Has to be Sam.

While Spirit would make the most sense as he needed enormous willpower to get up that mountain, the box will include a leadership and tactics hero. So that would make him tactics.

With the second one anyone's guess is possible really, but leadership Eomer would be logical imo.

We just dont have a spirit version of Eomer.  We got a Tactics Theoden and Spirit Theoden, so why not add a spirit Eomer for Spirit Rohan?

Like many, I predict Sam witl be neither, as he'll be of the Fellowship sphere with the Ring-bearer trait.

I've been thinking that all along...there has to be a non-frodo ring bearer given how all the cards reference the trait, not frodo, the way the hobbit sagas just referenced Bilbo by name.

And Sam was briefly the ring bearer during Return of the King, so it definitely fits. Maybe we'll get 2 ring bearers, a new frodo, and a Sam?

## 19 [donkler on August 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228555-last-saga-box-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=2384763)

It would be pretty cool if we got a Sam Ring-bearer. Then you could go back and play through the whole campaign with him instead of Frodo.

also no Spirit Aragorn yet. i could see a Spirite Eomer, but here are my predictions:

Fellowship Sam Gamgee

Spirit Aragorn

Leadership Eomer

Reminder that in the books Sam was perfectly willing to let the Ring go to the Enemy when Frodo died because it's a servant's place to die at the feet of his master.

 

He only didn't go through with it because he realised Frodo wasn't actually dead.

 

 

Wake me up when we have ally Elladan and Elrohir.

Personally, I hope that the battle at the Black Gate and the destruction of the Ring are both rolled into one epic climactic quest. After all, the point of the battle was to distract Sauron from the Ringbearer, and it only ended when Frodo's quest succeeded. It'd be interesting to, say, divvy your heroes up between two separate staging areas (one with Fellowship Aragorn, the other with Fellowship Frodo), where success at the Black Gate makes it easier to climb Mount Doom and destroy the Ring.

 

That might be a pipe dream, but this is a speculation thread!

I suspect that they'll be two separate quests where how long it takes for you to get the ring into the hot molten magma is how long you have to survive at the Black Gate.

Ally Elladan and Elrohir would be great.

 

The description of Sam's choices is a bit uncharitable.  He actually made the decision to abandon Frodo and bear the ring to the doom before returning to die with the body, but reversed himself when he heard the Orcs discovering the body.  His intent in returning was to *attack* the Orcs and recover the body -- being a realistic sort, he figured that even invisible they would get him in the end and the ring would be lost, but that was the probable outcome, not his actual goal.  His goal was to recover Frodo.

 

Nor did his priorities change when he discovered Frodo wasn't actually dead.  The goal, as before, was to recover Frodo, even if (like before) the probable outcome was the end of everything.  He had the presence of mind not to wear the ring in Mordor, and the strength of will to avoid claiming the ring.  After recovering Frodo it was he who provided both the planning and drive to get them to the Crack of Doom.  And he was the only person in the history of the Middle Earth to ever give the ring away, knowing what it was.

 

It took a miracle for the choices of Master Samwise to result in Frodo's rescue instead of loss of the ring -- but a miracle was what Gandalf had hoped for the whole time.  Consider that Gandalf allowed and approved Frodo to carry the ring from the Shire to Mordor with the burden and attachment to it growing with each step -- yet Gandalf knew at the very beginning that Frodo did not have the strength of will to even cast the ring into his own harmless fireplace, and that Gandalf could not make him do so without breaking his mind!  A fool's hope was all there was, a hopeless journey.  The benevolent hand of fate was working overtime for Frodo and Sam on that journey.

 

If Sam had abandoned Frodo, it seems likely to me that knowledge of Frodo's possession of the room would have been forced from him, and Sam would have no chance of reaching Sammath Naur against a forewarned Sauron.  In letting his heart overrule his head, he took the only path that actually would have preserved the quest.

and this brief period can turn itself into a quest idea, where Sam is searching for Frodo, then protecting him...

I wonder how they're going to handle the Battle of the Black Gate. Will it be its own quest, or will it be combined with Mount Doom? Both options have potential problems.

 

If Morannon is a distinct quest (either before or after the Mount Doom quest), then it hurts the continuity that the developers have been emphasizing in campaign mode, where a saga box generally follows the same group of heroes. The desire to preserve that continuity was likely a significant factor in why the designers chose the battle with corsairs as the second quest in The Flame of the West, even though (as the announcement article mentions) that "never played out on the foreground of The Return of the King." They might also have to include an extra Fellowship Aragorn, since all saga quests have fellowship heroes, Frodo wouldn't fit, and they don't assume players have earlier saga expansions (except for campaign mode). It would be interesting to have Mount Doom (likely including Gorgoroth) as the second quest, and the longer it takes to destroy the Ring, the longer players have to survive in the third quest (the battle of Morannon). This would feel like an anti-climactic conclusion, though. Also, any such arrangement would need to work well when the quests are played individually, while ideally feeling closely connected in campaign mode.

 

If, on the other hand, the battle of Morannon and Mont Doom are combined in one quest, there are a few complications. Perhaps something like Flies and Spiders would work, with one staging area for the Ringbearer and another for all the other players, maybe using two different encounter decks. However, the quest needs to be playable in true solo, so there needs to be an option to deal with either the battle or Mount Doom in an abstracted way. Flies and Spiders worked well in solo because the first player was doing the most interesting stuff, while the other players were treading water until the first player rejoined them. (Breaking of the Fellowship tweaked this formula: it worked decently well in solo, but was better with more than one player, where the other players could support the first player.) If the quest is designed so that the focus is on the Ringbearer in true solo, many players would be disappointed if the epic battle is abstracted.

 

They could also try something like Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim, with the Ringbearer in a separate area (like the Riddle area, and perhaps immune to player card effects), and some encounter cards that give players a choice: either make the battle more difficult, or do something (perhaps some form of test) that risks damaging the Ringbearer but can make progress towards destroying the Ring. If the designers choose this option, I would want them to allow players to switch heroes before this quest. Perhaps in campaign mode the first player would control Fellowship Aragorn (and technically also control the Ringbearer, but the Ringbearer's in his own area with special rules). This option would disrupt the continuity between saga quests a bit, since it wouldn't include a role for the heroes that have been supporting the Ringbearer (unless you teleport them to participate in the battle of Morannon), but it seems like a decent compromise.

 

I like this last option, since the game does a better job of modelling an external struggle (like the battle of Morannon) than an internal struggle--which Frodo ultimately lost. Tolkien wrote about Frodo's failure in letter 192:

> And surely it is a more significant and real event than a mere 'fairy-story' ending in which the hero is indomitable? ... In this case the cause (not the 'hero') was triumphant, because by the exercise of pity, mercy, and forgiveness of injury, a situation was produced in which all was redressed and disaster averted. Gandalf certainly foresaw this. [a reference to when he says to Frodo: "Do not be too eager to deal out death in judgment. Even the very wise cannot see all ends. My heart tells me that Gollum has some part to play yet, for good or ill before this is over. The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many."]
> 
> ...
> 
> Frodo deserved all honour because he spent every drop of his power of will and body, and that was just sufficient to bring him to the destined point, and no further. Few others, possibly no others of his time, would have got so far. The Other Power then took over: the Writer of the Story (by which I do not mean myself), 'that one ever-present Person who is never absent and never named' (as one critic has said).

 

It's tricky to try to recreate some of Tolkien's central themes in game form, since a cooperative game often becomes a challenging puzzle to solve. There can be moments of eucatastrophe, like revealing Eagle of the Misty Mountain when the situation seems hopeless in The Battle of Five Armies, but those tend to be exceptions. If the designers manage to design this quest (or these quests) so that Aragorn and companions can make life easier for the Rinbearer by making it more difficult for themselves, I'll be pretty happy. If they can somehow reflect that destroying the Ring is not simply a question of willpower or power gaming, that would be wonderful.

I would love to see a Sam Ring-bearer.  They have left the design space open.  However, I don't know if they have really left space open for themselves in the format of the boxes.  A Sam Ring-bearer in this box would mean that players picking up only this box and the Core Set would have no Frodo Ring-bearer.  I think we'll either see both a Sam and a Frodo Ring-bearer in the last box (2 fellowship heroes), or only Frodo.

They could give us a two sided ring bearer with Frodo on one side and Sam on the other....

That's true and I would love to see him as a hero in the near future but I don't think it will be in the Saga Box because that's not the right place storywise to put him. Maybe he will be the hero of a normal adventure pack in the upcoming Harad cycle (probably the 6th pack where most of the prominent heroes have come out in the last cycles).

I'd love to see another hero version of Elladan and Elrohir (without abilities explicitly tied to each other), just because it would open up deckbuilding with the existing two heroes.

From the Black Riders rulebook:

 

>  
> 
> The Lord of the Rings: The Black Riders features Frodo Baggins, a hero who belongs to the Fellowship sphere. This new version of Frodo Baggins is the only hero with the Ring-bearer trait included in this box. Future Saga Expansions may include different heroes with the Ring-bearer trait, but for now the players must use Frodo Baggins when playing the scenarios in The Lord of the Rings Saga Expansions.

 

It looks like it was their intention from the start to include other ring-bearers, and Sam for the Cirith Ungol quest seems like the only logical choice.

I think the destruction of the Ring almost has to be combined with another quest (Battle at the Black Gate makes most sense, I think).  Otherwise, what would you even be doing during the quest?  The only enemy to fight is Gollum, so would the entire rest of the quest just be exploring locations and avoiding treacheries representing corruption by the ring?  Combining it with the Black Gate would fit because that was the entire point of the battle!  It wasn't "we need to hold off until Frodo destroys the Ring" (it would have made more sense to stay in Gondor if they'd wanted to do that).  Rather, by challenging Sauron directly, they forced him to empty Mordor and give Frodo a clear path to Mount Doom.  This could be represented by the Ring-bearer having his own separate stages which get more difficult based on how many enemies are in the main party's staging area.

 

Not to mention, if we combine the two then we'll have room for the epic climax of the entire trilogy:  the Scouring of the Shire!

... at think that will be a stand-alone, kind of gencon type of quest. There is something anti-climatic about doing gutter-alley politics in back-country after destroying The One Ring in the Land of the Ennemy, especially from the point of view of the mechanic of this game.

I love the Scouring of the Shire, but it is more of a denouement than a climax.  So my guess for quests would be:

 

1) Rescuing Frodo from Cirith Ungol (Sam as ringbearer)

2) Crossing Gorgoroth

3) Combined Morannan/Mount Doom

 

#1 you really *need* to have Sam as the ringbearer and Frodo as the objective.  We did make it successfully past Shelob in Land of Shadow -- but then, Sam and Frodo also thought they had made it past Shelob before Frodo was struck down.

 

I really really want Scouring of the Shire as a print-on-demand quest, though.

I don't know...I think Crossing Gorgoroth would fall flat for many of the same reasons as Mount Doom as a standalone quest, not to mention what events really happened that would make Gorgoroth stand out on its own?  It was nothing but the purest of pure travel.  To me, it would be like if the first Hobbit saga box had started with the troll quest, then had an entirely separate quest devoted just to traveling from the trolls' cave to Rivendell.

I would love to see cards that make these heroes more playable. I think we would've seen them already if they were being planned though. Weren't they at helms deep? Did they come with Aragorn after helms deep? I can't remember.

I believe they arrived with the Grey Company and joined Aragorn through the Paths of the Dead.

To be clear, I'm not particularly expecting Elladan/Elrohir allies in the final saga expansion, and certainly not new hero versions.  They came with the Grey Company, bear counsel from Elrond, and help out with healing in Minas Tirith, but aren't really major characters.  But I would like to see new versions of Elladan/Elrohir in both ally and hero form, to make the current Elladan and Elrohir not so joined at the hip.

 

For that reason, I wouldn't really want to see a Kili/Fili effect for the ally versions, since it would be a wasted effect for a Elladan ally in an Elrohir hero deck.  I would like to see some sort of ability that keys on the other being active, so that the ally versions have synergy with each other as well with the hero versions.

It is, and it will be interesting to see how the quest deals with that.  Besides the orc troop they travelled with, they were actively being shadowed by Gollum and had a near encounter with a warrior/tracker combo specifically looking for them.  There's no shortage of potential enemies on the plains of Gorgoroth, and a particular problem faced by Sam and Frodo was that the roads that made it much, much easier to travel, were much, much more likely to have enemies on them.

Ok, so there were a bunch of potential encounters.  They almost ran into the trackers.  They were nearly found out by the orc troop.  However, actual combat did not occur, and furthermore, would have been disastrous if it had occurred!  When reading the story, it's not that it's tense because getting caught will be more dangerous; rather, it's tense because getting caught means utter failure!  Will we force only secrecy decks to play this quest?  Or will we simply suspend every last shred of disbelief and assume that starting a massive battle just down the road from Barad-dur, with the Ring in hand, won't doom all of Middle Earth to darkness?

 

I know the natural response to this is that the entire game is full of changes from the books (hence why we can even select different heroes/decks in the first place), but I feel this would be a change on a much larger scale.  It's one thing to say that a different fellowship set out from Rivendell, or that the party escaped Moria before the Balrog showed up, or that a legion of dwarves helped defend the Hornburg.  These are all deviations from the books, but they all fit within the overall feel of the story (even something like Thorin and Balin helping out could fit within some sort of alternate timeline).  Fighting one's way across Gorgoroth, however, does not, in my opinion, fit with the feel of the story.  The whole reason the fellowship was formed was because the blood of Numenor was spent and the elves were waning!  A Last Alliance-esque fight into Mordor was simply not an option.  Otherwise, what was the point in even going to the Black Gate?  Why not simply charge through Minas Morgul and catch up to Frodo and Sam, sweeping all enemies before them?

 

From a narrative standpoint, the crossing of Gorgoroth was certainly not boring.  However, it was exciting, not because of what happened, but because of what almost happened; because of what didn't happen.  This works in a book, but I don't really see how it could be translated into gameplay without either vastly changing the nature of game or doing irreparable harm to the narrative.

JJ48 - large scare changes just now bother you? What about all that combat in the Dead Marshes that didn't happen, or the combat along the Paths of the Dead that didn't happen, or the fighting of Black Riders in the Shire that didn't happen? This game has multiple aspects and quests have to be designed to include them all as a matter of pure gameplay. If that departs from the book, then so be it, but don't pretend like Gorgoroth is the first time it's happened

## 55 [dalestephenson on August 26, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228555-last-saga-box-speculation/?do=findComment&comment=2386594)

I think Sam and Frodo alone absolutely, positively constitute a secrecy deck.  Is that the only possible approach that could have worked?  Possibly not.  If the two had engaged the tracker and Uruk and slain both (not a certain outcome), the end result would have been two dead orcs off-road, instead of one dead orc and one deserted orc.  I doubt this would've made any appreciable difference to Barad-Dur.

 

Remember, Frodo was actually caught by the enemy, and intelligence concerning him and the shortish "great elf warrior" was taken to Sauron, and including a *very* valuable artifact.  As the Mouth of Sauron showed, they *knew* there were spies lose in Mordor, and they *suspected* those spies were personally known to the captains of the invading host and their mission was of great importance to the captains.  The spies were hunted, it just wasn't a huge priority, because as long as Sauron recovered the ring from this upstart Aragorn and his pitiful army it didn't really matter what the spies saw or did.  It never entered Sauron's head that the spies could actually do anything to really harm him, let alone destroy him.

 

"Fighting" across Gorgoroth would involve encounters with small groups of orcs, not the mighty armies that were assembled to oppose the armies of the west.  Before Frodo left, Aragorn came to the conclusion that the group going should be Frodo, himself, Gimli, Sam, and possibly Legolas.  That group would be no secrecy deck, but would still certainly try to sneak across Gorgoroth rather than fight their way across -- though they would do better against any enemies they did encounter.  A tracker/warrior orc pair would present less of a threat to the three hunters than to two frightened hobbits.

 

At any rate, we've already seen the Frodo part of the fellowship do a "just travel" quest across the dead marshes, and the risk of self-drowning was turned into actual undead enemies.  Surely using enemies that we know existed and even saw in action in Gorgoroth is at least as thematic.

Please re-read my post.  The point is that most of the changes so far have been things which could have happened, or at least which wouldn't feel completely out of place happening.  Fighting through Gorgoroth isn't just different from the book, nor is it simply unlikely.  It's the complete opposite, not just of what happened, but of the fundamental premise for building a fellowship to begin with!

If the enemies have suitably high engagement levels, then it's perfectly within reason.

Here's how I'd approach it at least:  2 saga heroes:  Frodo and Sam use one staging area, all other heroes use another.  The goal is to keep Frodo and Sam from being caught by keeping enemies out of their staging area (optional engagement, card effects, etc).  At the end of any turn if any enemies are in their staging area, all players are eliminated.  It preserves the macro-feint tactic and allows gameplay which mirrors the books as closely as possible in this format.  The ringbearer has the option of fighting, but if they can't silence the enemies in one round, they're position is given away.

That sounds about right (or possibly 1 saga hero + 1 of your other heroes).  I'd say we could combine that and Mount Doom with the Black Gate for a good, epic experience.  Initially, it would be the Captains of the West struggling to keep orcs from spilling over to Frodo's group, and then towards the end it would be Frodo's group struggling to beat Gollum and destroy the Ring before the captains are defeated!

I'd love a Sam ringbearer, but I feel like we'd need a Frodo ringbearer in the box then too. And maybe a Fellowship Aragorn as well? I don't know how many Fellowship heroes they'll actually want to include in the box, since they can't be used outside of the Saga quests.

 

I personally think it's more likely we'll see a Burden or Objective card in the first quest that grants a hero the Ring-bearer trait. I'd love it if it changed the hero's sphere to Fellowship and then you could use it to go back and start with any hero being the ring-bearer, not just Frodo, although that might be a game-balancing nightmare. There would be a certain poetry in having the two "regular" heroes in the last box being Frodo and Sam, though.

JJ48, I suggest remembering the Black Riders quests.  Which are awesome.

 

In the books, Frodo & company do not fail any Hide tests.  Nor is it plausible that Sam, Frodo, Merry, and Pippin would defeat a Black Rider they met on the road.  But pretty sure that happened in some peoples' games.

 

They can make this work, there is plenty of material and they have hit home runs with chapters that had less to go on.
