Just stumbled upon this post on Imgur:

Never seen this guys art before and I LOVE his depiction of both Glaurung and Balrogs. It is pretty obvious to me he is a MTG artist as well as his depiction of Glaurung is strikingly familiar and very similar to a bunch of dragons that were released shortly before I stopped playing MTG.

That one of Glorfindel fighting the Balrog has become my new phone screen  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Hope you all enjoy these are much as I did!

Amazing art. Wish we had some of these in the game.

Thanks for linking; these are amazing! That Glorfindel/Balrog one has great colouring. Also, Fingolfin... meh, who needs armour?

That's some unique Tolkien representation in art.
