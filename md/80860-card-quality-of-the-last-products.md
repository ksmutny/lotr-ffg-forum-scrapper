Hello there,

 

did some of you also recognized a warping of the cards since the last 2 or 3 adventure packs or am I alone with this notice?

 

Thanks for your answers

Mine have been fine…. What exactly do you mean by warping?  Colour that's not quite right or print that's misaligned or actual physical warping of the cards?

It is a physical warping. All the cards of an adventure pack have a strong curve along the longer side of the cards.

I had that problem with some sets of the Dwarrowdelf cycle. It was quite unpleasant and shuffling became a pain. Try to put some heavy books on your cards when you're not playing. It doesn't solve the problem completly, but it helps.

Same with me: The core set and the whole mirkwood-cycle is ok. Recently some packs of the last dwarrowdelf-cycle have this problem. I would like to know if there are any changes on the card quality.

I didn't have any problems with the recent sets (FoS, SaF, Hobbit 1, HoN).

 

 

 

Edit: I should have added that I have the German version. Don't know if that makes a difference.
