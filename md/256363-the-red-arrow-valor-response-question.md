It says...

"Valour Response: After attached hero quests successfully, add The Red Arrow to the victory display to search the top 5 cards of your deck for an ally and put it into play."

I pick an ally and put him in play, but what do I do with the other 4 cards? Put them back in same order? Shuffle back into deck? All similar examples I've found say one or the other. Closest FAQ I found was 1.21...

"Whenever a player searches through a deck, that player shuffles the deck after searching it unless a card effect says otherwise. Players do not shuffle or change the order of a discard pile after searching it."

But I didn't really search my deck -- I just "searched" the top 5 cards. So what do I do with these 4 cards?

Searching a deck doesn't have to mean searching the entire deck. Searching the top five cards of your deck is searching your deck. You shuffle.
