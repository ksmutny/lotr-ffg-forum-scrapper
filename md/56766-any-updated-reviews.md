I was looking for some updated reviews for this game, but could only find core set reviews. I noticed that this is a trend for LCGs. They get a review when the game releases and rarely a second look review after being out for a while and receiving expanded content during that time. 

So rather than ask is it worth buying, I would just like to know what has changed.

What issues did you have with the core set? 
If any, what issues have been resolved and what issues still exist?
Has the game felt balanced after 6 packs?
Have the packs made anything worse or feel underwhelming?
Is there a defining OP deck(s)?

Thanks

My only concern with the core set was the limited ability to deck build, which is not so much the case now, but that means for someone to buy in with all packs, you're looking at close to $100.

I recommend you go to Amazon and check out the reviews for the core set and expansion adventure packs. Lightdarker has done fairly extensive reviews of the core set and the AP's. He hasn't finished the Return to Mirkwood one but the others are done. Also download the Cardboard of the Rings podcast they talk about the different expansions and provide their opinions on them.

Some thoughts on this: The Core Set offers very little in the department of deck building, especially if you play with 2 players as I normally do (it's basically impossible with 3 or 4). Now, with 6 additional adventure packs, you really have the possibility to create a unique deck, try out some combos etc. The balancing isn't that great, however. Several of the player cards from the packs just plain suck (I'm looking at you, Keen-Eyed Took and To the Eyrie) while others like Ancient Mathom are very strong. The best cards still remain in the Core Set: Unexpected Courage, Northern Tracker, Steward of Gondor, and, of course, Gandalf. Eowyn and Beravor are also still the two best heroes in the game.

In general, the new quests are a mixed bag: They do scale better than the ones in the Core Set (with the exception of the last one, Return to Mirkwood), but they feel more bland and boring to me. I also dislike that a lot of them are very location- and thus questing.heavy. Here is what I think about each of them:

Hunt for Gollum:
Rather location-heavy with very few new enemies thrown in. A bit boring and unexciting.

Conflict at the Carrock:
The best one in my mind. Features a very challenging and exciting fight at the end and interesting mechanics to get there.

A Journey to Rhosgobel:
I like that you don't have much time in this scenario. I dislike its extremey deadly treachery cards as there are very few ways to deal with them. You basically just have to hope you don't draw too many. Also, the third stage of the quest is very ant-climatic. This feels like the most volatile and luck-based quest of them all.

The Hills of Emyn Muil:
The most boring of the bunch. Only one single quest card that isn't even exciting at all. You basically only quest all the time and collect locations - yawn.

The Dead Marshes:
Though I think the quest is slightly more interesting than Emyn Muil, this is the one I like the least because it's designed terribly. Basically, you have to catch Gollum which is represented via Escape Checks that use Willpower. Questing is arguably the most important part of the game anyway, but now you need even MORE willpower. But the really bad part is losing Gollum. It's very possible to lose him if you are not careful. Now, a lot of the cards still require you to make Escape Checks which doesn't make sense thematically at all. But the really bad part is that you have to find him again which means going through the entire encounter deck again. And if you reveal him as a shadow card or for an Escape Check, well, bad luck, please go through the encounter deck AGAIN. And again. And again... You can literally play for hours if you get unlucky - many hours of total boredom. Also, the final quest stage doesn't make sense if Gollum isn't there, and it is totally unclear rules-wise what happens there.
Either, the players should lose the game immediately if Gollum escapes, or there should have been a few cards (locations) that enable you to find him back from the discard pile. As it stands, it's just terribly designed.

Return to Mirkwood:
While the first 5 scenarios scale better than the ones from the Core Set, this here is like Escape from Dol Guldur again. Solo players will have to be EXTREMELY lucky, a party of 4 players shouldn't have a problem at all. There are 4 stages in the quest, but they don't feel all that different or innovative. It's an ok scenario, but I somehow expected a bit more.

 

As far as my experiences go, the best decks are ones that abuse the best cards from the Core Set the most. The Spirit/Leadership Rohan deck basically builds itself and is probably the best one for solo playing. I even managed to win Dol Guldur solo once with such a deck. Tactics still suffers from an inability to quest. Generally, I would have liked an additional hero or two that are really good at questing, but Eowyn and Glorfindel remain the only ones with 3 or more.

So, in conclusion, the possiblitiy for real deck building is now there, but it doesn't go so far to employ totally different strategies; the game doesn't really allow that as you always need to cover questing, defending and attacking, no matter what you do. It's especially interesting for 2 or more players where I feel you can get more creative. The new quests offer variety, but aren't all that great in my opinion (with the exception of Carrock and, partly, Rhosgobel and Return). The balancing could definitely be improved.

Trantor: thank you for you detailed opinion. I agree with everything you say actually. I do think the game is still worth hanging on with until at least Dwarondelf arrives. I love this game. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Good Trantor. I agree with you.

I really hope they will make second cycle more balanced and more interesting then first one.

That was exactly what I need to see Trantor. Thanks a ton buddy! (can I call you that?)

I have decided it is better for me to stick to my Raid decks for the WoW TCG and the new dungeon decks. I was torn having to decide between the two games, however, I have a ton of WoW TCG cards and don't feel like investing in a 'iffy' co-op LCG...especially after having spent all that money on the Warhammer one that still suffers from major issues.

Trantor, you are not right about difficulty for solo Return to Mirwood. Quest is totally manageable if you play solo. I am currently 3-3 and really, I got lucky only in one game.  I even won a game which was very unlucky for me (1st turn attercop). Hard, but you can win it and you don't need "extreme" luck
