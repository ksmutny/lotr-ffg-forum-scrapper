If both the 1A quest card and the nightmare card have the setup text which happens first?  In some scenarios it doesn't make sense to have the nightmare set up come first.  However, in some scenarios it doesn't make sense for the 1A quest card set up to come first.

 

Nightmare Encounter at Amon Din (Example for Nightmare set up coming first not making sense)

 

Nightmare Set Up instructs players to place 1 villager token on Rescued Villagers (this cannot exist unless players have already completed the setup on the 1A quest card).

 

Nightmare Assault on Osgiliath (Example of 1A quest card set up coming first not making sense)

 

Nightmare Set Up instructs the players to add Palace Remains (a unique location to the staging area).  However, the setup on the 1A quest card instructs the players to search the encounter deck for unique location(s) so if you resolve the 1A quest card first you can pull the Palace Remains out first as one of your unique locations basically negating the impact of the Nightmare set up card.  But it seems the intent is to have Palace Remains + additional unique locations depending on the number of players.

I think you start the Nightmare process right after the set up of the regular quest cards. That's what I do most of the time, and everything works.

 

And remember LOTR LCG rule of thumb : ''If it screws the players, that's how it's played".  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

Pretty positive you do the setup for 1A first then the nightmare set up and the Assault on Osgiliath example is an oversight/mistake. Nice catch though!

Okay, so the order is...

 

1. Remove cards you are supposed to remove.

2. Add cards you are supposed to add.

3. Follow set up on 1A

4. Follow set up on Nightmare

 

For the sake of including here because it is relevant, where would you put resolving set up on player cards (in the case of campaign)?  That happens before you do any of the set up for the scenario right?  Because players would have already drawn their hands.

wait hang on. Resolving set up on player cards..? Oh right for campaign... do you mean like the permanent boons and boons that are added to your deck?

I imagine this would happen before you do the setup for the scenario like you suggest so that you can potentially draw one of the boons that get shuffled into your deck in your opening hand.

Has there been a definitive ruling on this? It seems a bit weird to me. I am just about to play Nightmare Dead Marshes and the instruction to put the Mere of Dead Faces into play is on the nightmare card. Having this follow the setup in 1A is strange because it might be revealed by 1A or discarded in an Escape test. Also it would not place an initial 2 resources on Gollum.

No.  It seems to me that the correct order to do these set up effects is contingent upon which scenario you are doing.  I just choose whichever one is harder at this point.  Because sometimes it is easier to do 1A first and sometimes it is easier to do the Nightmare setup first.
