So, we've had a few threads on which are the best cards (and the associated problems with defining which is 'best') but how about a much simpler question - Who's your favourite (and explain why) 1 Hero out of the 12, and one player-deck card (let's leave out Gandalf for a minute, or else this could get boring.)

Picking favorites is difficult for me.  After thinking about it though, I think I would have to say Eleanor is my favorite hero right now even though she's not my most played.  She has lower stats, which gives her a smaller threat cost.  I like her ability.  I also like that her best stat is defense, so if she isn't used to cancel a treachery card she can be used as a defender in relative safety.  I really like the art on her card.  Finally, the fact that she is a character from Middle Earth Quest, and doesn't appear in the books anywhere makes her very intriguing.

My favorite player card right now is probably Faramir.  He's my favorite character from the books, and he is a very good ally in the game.  I especially like the fact that if he has strengths in both questing and combat.

Favorite hero: Aragorn. Mostly because he was the only hero from the core set to allow playing multiple sphere. Dunhere is slightly taking over the title of favorite since the introduction of Dunedain Mark...

Favorite card: Hemanarth Riversong. The ability is especially strong when playing solo and he's got good stats for a 1-cost ally. Northern Tracker would probably be my second pick.

My favorite hero is Denthor with Dark Knowledge attached.  Not because of effectiveness, I just love the way mechanics reflect theme.

It was interesting as I was reading the posts, I kinda agreed with all of the above. I would not say Elanor is my favourite (outside the face) hero right now but she certainly works nicely. Same as Denethor, it is good they are left ready for either defense or their ability. Dark Knowledge is great on Denethor, yes, especially if you combine him with Gloin. And cards like Strength of Will or Common Cause are nice additions for Eleanor, too. Henamarth rocks. I so wish he were also Ranged as he's got the bow at hand but that would have been too powerful, surely. Northern Tracker, Faramir, both great allies. I really like how Gondorians work great For Gondor! with all their good defense and readiness (excluding the citadel guard, haha).

So I really like For Gondor! now, it is a hard choice but I will give it my point as an event. Ally goes to Henamarth. Attachment to Dunedain Mark. Hero to Dunhere. All would change in a moment/game though.

Hero: Legolas

Ally: Winged Guardian

Event: Feint

Attachment: Protector of Lorien

What? Thought I was going to go with a Tactics attachment, didn't you? I know, I broke the pattern.

Interesting. The Tactics sphere has not been much praised as of yet. I posted mine some days (or more than a week) ago and indeed my vote would be completely different now. Especially I would not go with Dúnhere and Dúnedain Mark anymore. It is a nice combo in the Anduin quest but not that useful in other quests - I have not played Carrock yet though where again it might become more prominent.

Legolas is a great hero to have. And the only Tactics one I have played in a month or so. I have tried Gimli and Thalin repeatedly and never found much liking of them. I am really looking forward to play Boromir. Not only I love the character from the book but if he is as previewed he shall be super strong - and even thematically fit.

To underline this topic, the favourite cards just totally depend on quest, strategy and deck-building. Protector of Lórien, for instance, is a great card as long as you can draw a big hand. You probably need to play Beravor and have Unexpected Courage in your deck to make this card useful enough. Of course there is Bilbo Baggins and even Gléowine can help but I feel Courageous Beravor makes Protector really shine.

Son of Arnor I like just about any time. Just yesterday it got me rid of the Hunters with Threat 10, Attack 10 without them attacking at all. It is some card. And For Gondor! just makes it even stronger as you get rid of the biggies in one go, using even your weakest Allies.

Both Dúnedain Signals are very powerful but you just need to use them at proper time.

Favorite Hero: Legolas, his art is amazing and I like his versatility in being good at fighting but also helps the quest. Perfect for his character

Favorite Ally: Haldir, I know he's not out yet but he's so freakin sweet (I like anything Magali Villeneuve does!)

Favorite Attachment: Dunedain Warning, I've waited so long for an attachment to help defense!

Favorite Event: Strider's Path, when I play it and Aragorn's questing, I get way too excited (It's the Bilbo/Pippin player in me)

Bonus!: Favorite Location: Carrock, it's picture is beautiful! I love picturing an epic fight on top of it!

Favorite Hero: Frodo, at first sight inconspicuous but he really shines while playing. He can take the most punishment of all Heros (for a price though).

Favorite Card: Fortune of Fate, for most people dead weight in the deck and its use is rather situational but it does what no other card can do. Whenever I played it (in the more difficult scenarios this card will be used more often) the feeling of relief was bigger than with any other card. Its like great, we are not doomed anymore, we're back in the game!".

Yes to the MV illustrations. Awesome. And also to mr Zweifel (sorry if I'm misspelling it now) and many other locations. The Hunt has some beautiful artwork.

Strider's Path as well (also by mr Z) and it is some card, probably best Lore event in game right now.

Haldir, again my sympathy. It is great Lore gets something like this.

Frodo, yes again, he is great in combo with Gloin, let the attack undefended and see wheter it makes you rich or if things go bad, you still survive.

Fortune or Fate. Interesting, I see where you coming from. But I am yet to find a place for it in my deck.

Which leads me to this last point for now. Boromir. It is the hero I am most looking forward to. And moreso since I have heard about his abilities. They just seem super awesome. The one that readies is already wonderful but the one that deals damage is intriguing and one can immediately think of Fortune or Fate. Spirit is definitelly a sphere to combo with Boromir.

My favorite hero is Eowyn.  I play solo, so having to commit several characters to any one thing can really bring a game down.  Her high wisdom makes it possible to quest efficently while saving my other heroes for attack and defense early in the game.

My favorite ally is Northern Tracker.  Sure, he is spendy, but his ability is amazing for dealing with the many lands that come up in Journey down the Anduin, and Hunt for Gollum (they come up because I choose them because I use this guy).  On top of that he has good stats, so his surviviblity is good. I would even say I like him more than Gandalf honestly.  The grey wizard is great, dont get me wrong, but he is a one turn bomb.  Nothern Tracker sticks around and ends up helping me more in the long run.

My favorite attachment... I think I would have to say Forest Snare.  Again, because I play solo, I dont like having to over commit to any one thing.  And when something nasty comes out (**** troll), I have to kill it fast... unless I have a Forest Snare handy.  With that on the big nasty, I can pelt him to death at my leasure.
