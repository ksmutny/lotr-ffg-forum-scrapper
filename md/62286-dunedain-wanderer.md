It looks like he's starting to skin a dead deer.  Nothing offensive.

 That wanderer just lost his vegan edge.

Cardgamedb.com is starting to put up pics! I really like the Wanderer art actually! Pretty sweet!

Yeah, quite a few really nice art pieces in this pack. Magali's brilliance goes without saying, but I also really like Lure of Moria. The map reflection in the axe blade produces a pretty neat effect.

the blades probably my favourite so far

song of earendil's nice- it will make a nice book mark for me

lure for moria, wanderer, elladan, out of the wild are all great

i cant really tell what the end comes is, i can tell that a dwarf is lying dead but its hard to see it, probably just the quality of the picture

i dont particularly like bombur or hail of stones

from what ive seen so far i think redhorn has better art....though im going to wait for cardgamedb to get them all up first

ps just seen the other pictures - the location cards are very tasty as always....

Yeah, locations are in general my favourite. Even if they are nasty I am not that angry to have them reveal when they look so nice.

I really like Lure of Moria. And the Song. Yes, Magali's usually that good.

I am not particularly fond of having bad guys on player cards but I see why on Hail of Stone. It is quite ugly though understandable.
