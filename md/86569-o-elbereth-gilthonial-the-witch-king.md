Does anyone know if you can use O Elbereth! Gilthonial! on The Witch-King to put him at the bottom of the encounter deck before his forced effect triggers and sends him back to the staging area? Can player card effects "override" forced encounter card effects?

The Witch-king

Type: Enemy

Encounter Set: The Massing at Osgiliath

Threshold: 40

Threat: 6 Attack: 6 Defense: 6 Hit Points: 11

Nasgul. Captain.

Players cannot play attachments on The Witch-king.

While The Witch-king is in the staging area, each character gets -1 Willpower.

Forced: After The Witch-king attacks, he returns to the staging area unless the defending play

O Elbereth! Gilthonial!

Type: Event

Sphere: Spirit Cost: 4

Secrecy 4.

Response: After an enemy attacks you, put that enemy on the bottom of the encounter deck. If your threat is lower than that enemy's engagement cost, set your threat equal to the engagement cost of that enemy.

FAQ

Forced Responses

Forced responses resolve immediately when their specified prerequisite occurs, and before any response effects that also can be triggered off the same prerequisite.

How I would resolve it, Resolve any “after x attacks” forced events would happen before the normal response window.

1) Witch-King attacks

2) Defend, shadow card, deal damage...

3) Player choice, raise threat? No. Return Witch-King to staging area

4) do response here.

But I see no reson why you can't play O Elbereth! Gilthonial! then. It does not require the enemy to be enaged with you, and should work even when the Witch-King is in the staging area.

i agree, there is nothing to say that the enemy must still be engaged with you

I see no reason why you can not play this card. Then pop Aragorn (Lore)... seams a good idea in fact to deal with the king. The King gose to the staging area before you can play the response, but there is nothing talking about the staging area... so yeah.. I call legal on this one as well.
