I've looked everywhere and I can't find anything. Have I missed a release date for the second Hobbit set?

I doubt its been released yet. Its generally bad for business to type up your next movie while the current one is in the theater. They'll wanna focus as much as they can on the hobbit part 1 for the next few weeks.

If i had to make a guess… same time next year.

I believe he is refering to the second Hobbit expansion to this game.

 

@ The_Big_Show: Expected Q1 2013; It is already at the printer…

 

You can see that info in the upcoming page at the top of the forum

I preordered mine on amazon and it says it'll ship in early January but i'm really not sure that's true. We'll see I guess.

this is being listed on amazon.co.uk now, and it has a release date of december 22nd.

…sounds a bit too good to be true, though

£20!!!  Wow.  Thats about $6.50 off the US price.  I always thought stuff in Britan was more expensive than in the US.  Then again this page does look suspect.
