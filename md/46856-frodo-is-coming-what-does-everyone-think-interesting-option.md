Frodo Baggins
7 threat
2 willpower
1 attack power
2 defense power
2 health

Hero / Hobbit

Response : After Frodo Baggins takes damage, cancel all damage taken and increase your Threat by the amount of damage that was inflicted. Limit once per phase.

 

Interesting especially with Spirits threat reduction abilities.

I guess good as a continous defender against weaker foes, but  tough with the threat increase. Gandalf and The Galadhrim's Greeting will be working overtime with this one. Although I don't know what else is on that pack(The Carrock, right?) he doesn't really jump out at me. Thank you for the preview, though.

I can see how he will fit in. You can essentially keep him alive, even against Hill Trolls, Ufthak etc., as long as you have a way of reducing threat again. He's like a cannon fodder ally who just won't die.

And 7 threat is the joint-lowest we've seen from a hero so far, probably until Sam Gamgee shows up.

 I think he's quite amazing as Spirit can easily reduce the total threat. And he's quite cheap too. Far better than Eleanor for the same price in my opinion.

How are you going to keep him alive against a Hill Troll? He can't heal until he takes damage. Only works if you put a Citadel Plate on him. And if you are going to heal all 6 damage that the Troll dishes out, you might as well block him with someone else and earn less threat.

Another card for the 'after = when?' debate, probably. But the way I interpret his ability is that he can choose to cancel any amount of damage coming his way by transforming it into Threat. This is a Response which can be immediately activated upon receiving the damage, i.e. before he dies. He would be utter rubbish otherwise, as any damage higher than 1 would kill him outright.

I really like that they kept the formula for counting Threat Level = Will + Attack + Defense + Hit Points.

Hope they won't change that as Bilbo's preview suggested. His threat seemed FAR off. (To me.)

 If the actual wording is that he "cancels" damage, then it can´t be after the fact right? Then it would say "heal", and would of course be a lot less useful with his low HP.

## 11 [Titan on May 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46856-frodo-is-coming-what-does-everyone-think-interesting-option/?do=findComment&comment=469323)

Interesting argument. He does say cancel as opposed to heal. But it sounds as though he has to wait to be damaged to cancel said damage. As a response, would it not need to be triggered by suffering the damage? I don't think you can survive if you take damage up to or beyond your hit points. But as was said, clarification will probably be needed.

The art of this card is wonderful.

Titan@ : Frodo's abilitie is not to heal the damage but to cancel the damage so this makes him the best defender for spirit sphere against the troll.Now i can feel safe from the troll if the grey wizard has a more important task in Meaddle-Earth and he is not in my hand.

I get the different keyword. But then it is the after/when argument all over again. Cancel when I see it coming or after I've received it? The wording of the spanish card then leaves that open to interpretation. If it is before received, then yes, quite useful.

 When looking at the rules(Hit points and damage on pg20) it says "For each point of damage dealt to a character or enemy, one damage token is placed(...)". That might mean he gets incoming damage, but before that damage is actually translated to tokens, it´s canceled. At least then it works the way I hope it´s supposed to.happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Doesn't matter. The key word is cancel, so it is simply as if the damage never existed. If that damage is enough to kill frodo, you simply cancel it and take threat instead. Thats' different to heal as you can only heal damage after it has been applied, if in applying the damage you die, you don't get the opportunity to heal.

Yeah, I agree with Pumpkin. He defends and would take X damage. You can take that damage maybe if it were only 1 and he'd have 1 life left and no increase to threat dial, or if it were 2+ wounds you can ignore those wounds and increase your threat dial by that much. Either way, I see it as if wounds would be applied to him, you can ignore those wounds by increasing your threat dial.

Then quite frankly, the wording on the card stinks. How about "if Frodo would take damage" as opposed to "after Frodo takes damage"? It's difficult for me to believe that proffesional game designers make such elementary mistakes. I looked at other spanish heal cards and they do use a different keyword than cancel, so I must accept what others are saying. Good card, terrible wording.

## 18 [Hahma on May 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46856-frodo-is-coming-what-does-everyone-think-interesting-option/?do=findComment&comment=469412)

Yeah, I'm sure the wording could be better, but the mechanic seems fine to me. I'm sure he'll be helpful in a lot of situations to avoid huge wounds for another hero by defending with him or going undefended to use ready characters for combining for an attack or whatever. It may be worth it to increase your Threat dial in those situations, especially if you have that card in your hand that can reduce your Threat dial.

It will most likely be like game of thrones where the card goes in to a moribund state before it dies and goes away. Within that window you cancel the damage using Frodo's ability, so the damage no longer exists and you increase your threat equal to the amount of damage canceled. Pretty much makes Frodo one of the best defenders in the game.

 I guess it really depends on the way you see it - that's the problem with language and its nuances and double-entendres...

you could use "after" in the sense of "when", because first you receive the damage and then, immediately and subsequently, you cancel the damage...

"when" can be used in the same sense - whenever Frodo receives damage, afterwards cancel it etc. ...

 

what is important for a card game, is to use a coherent and unified terminology - not to many erratas - and to avoid redundancies and therefore too long card texts (as was the case in the beautiful and still best ccg in the galaxy MECCG...)

 

anywhooooooo, GREAT card, reminds me of LOTR CCG by Decipher where you could "avoid" the damage by assigning burdens :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] CAAAAN't wait for the expansions...

 The french version says "When…".

But it's a response so it's obvious he doesn't take any damage when using it. It's not an action.

## 22 [Titan on May 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46856-frodo-is-coming-what-does-everyone-think-interesting-option/?do=findComment&comment=469603)

I don't know what makes it so obvious. By their nature (and the rulebook definition) a response is something that is triggered by an occurrence and happens immediately after said occurrence. The keyword cancel would seem to contradict this, as it suggests that something is being pre-empted before it happens. I guess it is as Toqtamish said, the character is in a moribund state and can still be saved. He takes the wounds and then they are canceled. Seems a bit counter-intuitive to me, but it is what it is.

## 23 [Bohemond2 on May 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46856-frodo-is-coming-what-does-everyone-think-interesting-option/?do=findComment&comment=469609)

If we look at other cards with cancel effects, I see the functioning as obvious as well.

When you draw a shadow card, "The active player flips that enemy’s shadow card faceup and resolves any shadow effect that card might have."  Suppose you draw Hummhorns, " deal 1 damage to each character the defending player controls. (2 damage instead if this attack is undefended."  In response you play Hasty Stroke, "Response: Cancel a shadow effect just triggered during combat."

Is the damage from the Shadow card applied?  The rules state that their is no time between revealing the shadow card and resolving it.  Do you only resolve Hasty Stroke after applying the damage?  Of course not.  I think everyone agrees that that by using the word "cancel" Hasty stroke keeps the card from ever resolving, even though the game has no  resolution phase for shadow effect. Frodo works the same way, he keeps damage from being dealt.  I do hope that the language on the English card will help clarify this, since so many people find it unclear.

Well how many times did the Frodo's companions think he was gone for?  happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] Got stabbed by the Cave Troll with the spear (or so they thought) but had the Mithril shirt on to save him. Then he got stabbed by the Nazgul sword and nearly died and then he got bitten by the spider and thought dead by Sam but was just paralyzed. So perhaps it's like he's thought to be a goner by taking the wounds but can still be saved by not giving the wounds and increasing the Threat. Being Frodo and close to death many times, it seems like a natural ability for him.

But that's just it, Hasty Stroke is clearly worded to just cancel an effect before it is applied. Frodo is nowhere as clear because of the "after he takes damage" part. Not arguing about the end result, it's become clear to me the designers intended him to work as you say he does. Just inconsistently worded, that's all. 

And Hahma, yes, good analogy. One thing is obvious, the designers have taken pains to tailor effects to the character's traits.

I think we should wait until we see the English text before we parse language to precisely.  Especially since the Spainish and French text apparently have important differences, and we all seem to agree about how the card should function.

I'm inclined to agree with Toqa on this. The wording on the card is not the greatest but I think that Frodo would be hit, by the troll for instance, but his response triggers before the damage tokens are applied to the card are instead changed into threat.

Also the other thing about the card is the fact that this is a translation from the spanish. It's interesting that the French version states that When Frodo takes damage, rather than after. Hopefully the English version of the card has less ambiguity to it.

That's also how it works in CoC, i.e. when a card would leave the game you get a 'last opportunity' to avoid that fate by playing a Disrupt.

And as I already pointed out in a different thread, there is no difference between 'when' and 'after'. They're used interchangably (in CoC).

It's interesting that they don't use "disrupt" anywhere in LOTR.  Instead they chose to use the word "cancel" in conjunction with a response (e.g. Eleanor's ability, or the Hasty Stroke event).  Maybe they didn't want to have the confusion that arises with CoC (actions, disrupts, disrupts of disrupts etc). Of course, then we get into discussions like this one.

Yeah, well. I looked up the CoC card which was used as an example (Enraged Gug) to explain this 'last opportunity' and it wasn't even a Disrupt. It was a Response, triggered by being wounded. So, even if the wounds/damage received would cause the character to be destroyed/dead, it could use its response before leaving play.

And in Frodo's case, the response happens to cancel the wounds/damage, thus avoiding destruction/death.

Wow Frodo is pretty impressive!

It seems pretty strong if this is "once per phase" and not "once per round". He's pretty much unkillable though maybe once he comes he will be needed for certain situations. Its also possible there will be something in the game that will kill a hero in a way other than damage.

Its cool to see such stronger cards coming out, but I also wonder if some core cards will become obsolete simply because they're not strong enough to match up to new scenarios.

Maybe Bilbo had higher threat because they valued his ability to merit it? Though his other stats seem to counterbalance it already and I would think Frodo's ability would also seem valuable.

 I'm there with you... if the power curve is too high at the beginning... then lots of cards become obsolete, or some have to be banned... nobody wants that... ccgs/lcgs are anyway quite complex to follow - there is so much meta-information, such as faq, clarification rules, banned, restricted lists, etc. etc. ... try starting with MtG now :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
