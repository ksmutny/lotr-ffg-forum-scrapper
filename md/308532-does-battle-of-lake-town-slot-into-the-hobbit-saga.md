I'm still relatively new to the game, and wasn't around for most of the PoD's initially.

I've learned that The Old Forest and Fog on the Barrow Downs can be played as part of the LotR Saga Campaign.


Is the PoD Battle of Lake-Town intended to slot into the Hobbit Saga, presumably between Lonely Mountain and Five Armies?

Officially no, do my player groups always put it there, yes and exactly where you said.

One more quest to use the Lonely Mountain Treasures, if nothing else.

That’s what we did and it definitely helps against Smaug
