# [Escape from Dol Guldur - Losing both heroes if 3rd is prisoner](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279827-escape-from-dol-guldur-losing-both-heroes-if-3rd-is-prisoner/)

I was playing Escape from Dol Guldur today, 2-handed solo. 

Eowyn was prisoner.  A nasty Shadow effect killed the 2 remaining heroes in her deck.  The 2nd deck still had all 3 heroes.

At that point, it was unclear how many "players" there were in the game: 1 or 2? 

If 2, then I'd need to keep revealing 2 encounter cards per turn, right?  And any bad cards which referred to the number of players would always evaluate to 2?  And the "heroless" player's threat would keep increasing?

Also, what happens to any allies controlled by that player?  Do they still fight on, or are they eliminated because there are no unimprisoned heroes left to support them?

When a player has only the imprisoned hero left, that player is eliminated -- and since that prevents the other player from rescuing the prisoner, the game is over.

I'm pretty sure the players would continue play, just like with Lost and Alone in Foundations of Stone. Of course in solo, it would be impossible to win, given players have no way of making progress.

It's in the FAQ:

Q: If all of a player’s heroes (except for the captured hero) are destroyed during the Escape from Dol Guldr [sic] scenario, is that player eliminated from the game? A: Yes, the player is eliminated, and the players (as a group) have lost.

It does make me wonder how the Lost and Alone would work, though, since in that case you are not eliminated.  I guess you would continue to engage enemies, take their attacks undefended (why not?) and use allies for quest/attack?

Huh, I remembered a ruling in a thread somewhere that you could continue play, but maybe that's just my imagination.

Yeah it seems pretty clear to me that you would not be able to continue, there is no game state where you'd keep raising your threat by one and drawing cards until your partner saves your last character and saves you from the void of emptiness you've been chilling in. That doesn't feel right. That's just my take on it however
