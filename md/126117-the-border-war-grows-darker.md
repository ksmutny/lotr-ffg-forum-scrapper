OMGZ! I am so excited for this! This is my second favorite deluxe expansion. Khazad Dum has been my favorite (in part because it was the first, and I was so excited when it was released), and the nightmare scenarios for that are amazing. I can't wait for these!

Oh man these nightmare quests will prove to be the hardest released I believe. Can't wait for the challenge.

My body is not ready.

 

I never asked for this!

 

Toughest nightmare quests in the game are incoming.

I'm really liking the art on the Haradrim cards.

That looks amazing! Cannot wait to get that!!!!

Just play hobbit nightmare, past all 3 quest from the first attempt and mu admit it was do boring to be honest. Nightmare dont make it more interesting and hard…. Just make it longer and annoying in my opinion.

HON nightmare looks really amazing. Cannot wait to see Steward fear Nightmare!!!!

Hmm, did I miss something? I don't remember FFG annuoncing the HoN Nightmare decks. 0.o Anyway, it's cool and I believe those are the toughest quests to date.

Wow, those Nightmare decks are coming in at high speed! And again, such great art!

Yes, it is a big nod.

 

Sorry for my english if it is not so clear.

Love this, can't wait to get my packs! It's time for the Gandalf deck to truly prove its quality...

 

The Harbor Brute is nasty. That dude's been hitting the Middle-earth equivalent of 'roids.

man, going to pick them up but they are going to be sooo hard.  To this day i still struggle mightily against into ithilien and siege of cair andros.  Art is really great as to be expected, the nightmare cards always give off a much more vicious vibe, especially in the illustrations

I forgot to mention that I love that they fixed the weirdness around the "drop the scroll" and "let Celador die" strategies.

I agree Ian, this will be a good chance for the Gandalf/Elrond deck to really show how powerful it is. As of now, I don't think there is a nightmare quest that that deck cannot steam-roll, save Escape from Dol-Guldur. It's pretty ridiculous how powerful it is. Hopefully these nightmare quests prove to be a challenge for it.

I wonder if they deliberately put this out on Halloween... it's certainly the scariest thing I saw all day.

Was same for Khazad-Dum nightmare decks.  FFG never announce just release. Anyway I'm very happy to see HON nightmare! It looks Blast! 

 

Sounds like in the future we all get new cycle and Nightmare card for them straight away! And i like it.

What nod are you guys talkin' bout'? 

 

Also, I hope those Brutes are not replacing Thugs completely, because that's gonna be INSANE! :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

Insane for the most of the players, still too easy for Glaurung. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Glaurung's lifeforce grows witheach failed quest and fallen hero. It is all a ruse.

I wonder what card belongs with the art in the Into Ithilien nightmare mode card, it's my favorite so far.

Probably I was just reading too much into it.  The original Harbor Thug has the "Thug" trait, but he is the only character in the game to do so, and no cards interact with it-- so I forgot he even had that.

 

When I saw the Thug trait on the nightmare enemy, I immediately thought of trololo's Thug set for OCTGN [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/100494-octgn-unofficial-set-thugs-to-the-rescue/] and assumed that FFG putting a meaningless Thug trait onto this card was a nod to that set.

 

Maybe it is!

Really? no other thug cards in the game?

## 27 [MyNeighbourTrololo on November 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126117-the-border-war-grows-darker/?do=findComment&comment=1319738)

Well, all I see is Harbor Brute just being a Harbor Thug 2.0...

not that I could find using two different databases!

Speaking of no cards interacting with the trait...
