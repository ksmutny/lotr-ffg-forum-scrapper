# [Good Lore/Tactics decks?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53822-good-loretactics-decks/)

## 1 [Creature on the Loose on September 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53822-good-loretactics-decks/?do=findComment&comment=533844)

I just scrolled thru Cardgamedb.com and didn't see too much in the way of a Lore/Tactics deck built from just one core set. I've tweaked my Leadership/Spirit deck based on an idea listed there, but I am now trying out the infamous Journey Along the Anduin and have gotten bootstomped by a certain Hill Troll in back to back games (thought I had a shot in the second game, but a surging Wolf Rider revealed a second HT and I just scooped).

I plan on getting more cards (likely the adventure packs and the big-box expansion, not a second core set) so I know the pool will grow, and along with that, my options. In the meantime, does anyone have a suggestion for a decent Lore/Tactics deck that I could run?

And on a side note, a question about Steward of Gondor: Once attached, can I conceivably use it twice in a turn? If I use it at the end of the combat phase, can I use it again after I refresh during the action window at the end of the refresh phase? Dumping four resources onto an Aragorn that has Celebrian's Stone on him seems pretty naughty.

Thanks for the help!

Not sure how that latter use is any different from just using it early next turn (Planning Phase)? But Refresh Phase has a green window, so go for it.

Yeah, I don't see why you couldn't do it, but since it already refreshed it would not refresh again, so it would be exhausted for the whole next turn. It's really not any different than just exhausting it at the beginning of the next turn.

I use Glorfindel, Beravor, Legolas as my heros in a deck designed to be a "One Deck to Rule them All" to be able to beat the first three expansion scenarios. So far it's doing an ok job. I worked Carrock the other day with this. I use one core set with three expansions. In the tactics cards I focus mostly on the eagles with Radagast in there. I also include Song of Kings and a handful of the important Leadership attachments.
