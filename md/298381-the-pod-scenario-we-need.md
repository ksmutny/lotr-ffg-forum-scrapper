The PODs have given us some of the most unique scenarios from grand sieges to murder mysteries to dungeon crawls. Now with what appears to be the darkest cycle on our hands, I think that next years GenCon POD should be a total juxtaposition. 

Here's the image! The year is somewhere between 2978 and 2988 (certainly within the timeframe of the game). The setting Farmer Maggot's Fields. Your quest: help Farmer Maggot stop rabbits and crows and pesky young hobbits from stealing his crops! And the big bad at the end of the scenario is young Frodo Baggins!

Sounds like one of the side quests in Journeys in Middle Earth...
