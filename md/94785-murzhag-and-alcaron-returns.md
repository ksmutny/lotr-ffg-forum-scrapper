You kill one captain, and he is discarded to the encounter discard pile. If you return to shuffle the discard pile to encounter pile (because empty of cards during the game). You can revealed Murzhag (or Alcaron).

Is it possible? Or there is any rule that avoid it?

This is how the scenario is set up.

Not sure if it is intentional but it does seem a bit against the spirit of the scenario.

I look at it as one of those moments when the evil villain, thought to be defeated, jumps out again to terrorize our heroes one last time!  We can thank every action movie ever made for that.

Did anyone ever made it through the whole encounter deck? :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

I just set them aside when I defeat them. I think it was an unintentional mistake made by the designers. It makes no thematic nor mechanic sense to shuffle them back into the encounter deck. It seems the designers made a couple blunders with this last quest of the cycle (the other being Murzag's forced effect). Kind of sad...

Yes also have this problem since my deck was almost finish i understand they will shuffle back….In 3 4 players game is possible for sure meet them 2 times. But last stage say if you kill Nazgul you win so doest matter i other captain still in play but anyway is quite weird to meet them again. 

Anyway this kind of mistakes is not new for this game so everything alright actually...
