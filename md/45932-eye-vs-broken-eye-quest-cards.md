Curious if this is a misprint or something common: on the quest cards I've got with the 'Eye' icon, about half of them have little white lines (almost like broken glass) running through the 'pupil'. None of the other quest cards have a difference like this. Curious if this is something that will be utilized in future quests or if it's just a misprint. Anyone else have this?

That would be a print quality issue as the list of encounter deck cards that FFG posted today has only the one Sauron's Eye.

 It is one of the mysteries of Middle Earth, something that will never be uncovered by mortal men. The uncertainty will haunt us until the great Fantasy Flight releases us from the shackles of ignorance. 

 

As far as I can tell nobody knows why some of the Sauron's Reach cards have a broken eye symbol.

Theoretically they could use this missprint to justify another set of encounter cards that sync with the "Broken eye" in future expansions!
