There actually are quite a few interesting topics beside these two... though I suspect either could be just a sarcasm.

what a good way to put it. That's exactly what will happen with most of the visitors if we don't pull ourselves together and stop taking everything posted as a personal attack. Focus the energy on the game and the news and stop all the Infighting...;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

This is becoming silly.

 

There's plenty of good discussion to be had.

I personally think there's a lot of good discussion in the threads in between people talking about people not getting on too.

I feel like you're right and we actually shouldn't be discussing it - there isn't much to be said on it.

Guys, guys....he didn't say "discuss", he said "DISCUS".  It's a subtle play on words, meant to disentangle the existential angst and ennui over the absurdity of human existence in a posthumanist environment of rapid change and rootless anomie in a digital universe.  The "discus" is a deconstructed anti-establishmentarian symbol of the rapid exchange and return of egoless drift.

 

Either that, or it's just a typo.
