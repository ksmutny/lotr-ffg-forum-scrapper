 Do the Hummerhorns enemy card use their ability if a player chooses to engage them before the Hummerhorns engage the player with the required amount of threat?

Thanks in advance!

yes it will hit 4 5, even if you choose to fight it

As stated in the rulebook, it does not matter who engages who. When an enemy is engaged the player is said to have engaged the enemy AND the enemy is said to have engaged the player, regardless of who initiated it.
