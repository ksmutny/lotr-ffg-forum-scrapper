I just started creating my own custom cards with Strange Eons, but I'm having trouble finding art for the cards. 

Does anybody have some great sources where much LOTR art is displayed that can be used for the custom cards?
I did try Google (still trying), but I can't really find what I'm looking for. Alas, I'm no great artist.. 

Any tips would be welcome! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Try DeviantArt, either typing keyword related to middle earth or medfan ones.

Otherwise, try Google.

I have a bit of creating custom lotr cards background, and I'll tell you that most of what you'll find on deviant art when searching specifically - is boobs. Lots of boobs. Most precious and fitting pieces of art I found was the ones through long chain of reference through "looks like" section.

Yeah, +1, exactly the same, I make fancards and most of the art I found was through "looks like" function, it is quite hard to find it though...

 

(Except when I was making touhou fancard... in this case I used danbooru... lots of boobs too)
