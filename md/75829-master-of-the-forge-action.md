Hey all. Was just wondering if someone could clarify for me: if you use master of the forge to search for an attachment and do not find one, do you still get to shuffle your deck? Or do you have to get an attatchment to then shuffle? I would think its the former, but I would just like to be sure. Thanks!

You have to shuffle the cards, even if you do not get an attachment on the 5 cards….

From the official FAQ 1.3:

(1.21) Search Effects
Whenever a player searches through a deck, that player shuffles the deck after searching it unless a card effect says otherwise. Players do not shuffle or change the order of a discard pile after searching it.
