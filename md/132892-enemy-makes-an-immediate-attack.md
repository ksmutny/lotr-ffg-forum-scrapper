when an enemy makes an attack due to a when revealed effect or a shadow card does it get dealt a shadow card?

From the FAQ:

 

 

(1.26) Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase If an enemy attacks outside of the combat phase, it is still dealt a shadow card at the beginning of the attack. Then follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 “Combat” in the rules. Any shadow cards dealt to the attacking enemy are discarded after the attack resolves.

Regarding immediate attacks:

Does the enemy get to attack again during the combat phase?

I'm new to the game and have the black riders expansion. The black riders have hide 2 and then if player fails hide check the black rider makes an immediate attack. I find this comes up during the quest phase during the card draw but also during set up as I understand we have to resolve card effects during set up as well (please advise if I'm off on this).

Also, the first quest (can't recall the name) seems pretty hard with all the hide checks and all the locations that come out. Keeping up with questing and hide checks has been a real challenge when playing 2 player. Love this game!

Yes, the enemy will make another attack in the combat phase.

Yes!

Yes, you have to resolve hide tests during set up.

Double argh!

Thanks for the quick replies!

Just to clarify, it seems I was wrong.  If a card with Hide X is "revealed" during the set up, then you must do the Hide test.  However, I don't think any cards with Hide X are "revealed" during set up as most of the stage 1A cards I looked at say "add" them to the staging area which is different. 

 

Basically, as a general rule of thumb, if a card with Hide X is "revealed" you must do the Hide test. It does not matter when it happens (it could happen in the refresh phase due to some card effect) as long as the card is being "revealed".

The first Black Rider doesn't require a Hide test, because the rules of Hide say

 

>  
> 
> When an encounter card with the Hide X keyword is revealed

 

and the Quest card says

 

>  
> 
> Add 1 Black Rider to the staging area

 

without mentioning "revealing" it.

 

Note that the second and third quest cards explicitly say "reveal", so it is only the Black Rider during Setup that doesn't trigger his Hide keyword.

Ok this helps... Thanks again all.

Just to clarify - if an enemy makes an additional attack during the combat phase (say due to their shadow card they were just dealt), do they get an additional shadow card for that additional attack?  (Assuming it is not mentioned in the shadow effect.)

It is generally accepted that, yes, they would get dealt a new shadow card for an additional attack.

 

FAQ 1.42 "Additional attacks by an enemy":

 

> When an enemy makes an additional attack, discard all of its previously dealt shadow cards before dealing it a new shadow card.

 

It is generally accepted that this means that enemies that make additional attacks are dealt shadow cards for them, although, this has been discussed at length in another thread and some think that this ruling does not necessarily mean they would be dealt a new shadow card (unless they were directed to by card effect).  The thread referenced is here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194002-do-additional-attacks-receive-shadow-cards/?hl=%2Badditional+%2Battack].

That's the way I'd been playing it for awhile now but the distinction earlier of "out of the combat phase" seemed only specific and didn't directly address additional attacks inside the combat phase.
