Hey all,

My buddy and I got our butts handed to us last night running what I thought were pretty solid decks given the scenario. Unfortunately it was his turn to buy the expansion so I have no way of examining the encounter deck we played against to brainstorm ways to beat it.

Hall of Beorn doesn't have the encounter set up yet. Does anyone know anywhere else I can look to find the cards, besides just having my friend take pics and sending them to me?

I was gonna say cardgamedb but they arenâ€™t up there yet either

There are these. I'm not sure of the quantity of each specific card though.

I would have liked to see some kine as enemies, but so far they only seem to appear on locations.
