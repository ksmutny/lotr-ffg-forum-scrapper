Anyone else like the regular art better?

That original card was such a masterpiece. It's one of my favorites in the game along with hero arwen and alt art boromir. 

 

Really like alt art celeborn too. 

 

Another good old pic of galadriel is on keen as lances.

It’s the reason I actually had her as one my Heroes for so long, I just loved looking at her! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

That and she's awesome. I don't know why she doesn't seem get mentioned as much as other heroes as one of the top tier.  She controls your threat so well, and once you've played with her a bunch and then you stop you get frustrated with only drawing one card. Plus if you get nenya and unexpected courage on her you can do both threat and questing boost.

I don't know why but I kind of got a little HBO GoT daenerys vibe from the alt art.

I don’t even watch the show but I’ve got the same feeling for some reason. I think it might look like some of the art for her in the GoT FFG Games.

Scarlett Johansen.

Magali is a very talented artist, and I love much of her art for this game, especially when she draws elves. The objective ally version of Arwen is one of my favorite pieces of art in the game. I'm not a big fan of the original version of hero Galadriel, however. To me she looks too young and Hollywood-beautiful (wearing makeup that calls attention to itself), rather than ageless and classically beautiful. I prefer Magali's depiction of Galadriel in The Favor of the Lady and The Door is Closed! I'm not in love with the alt-art version (her face seems a bit impassive, and again she seems a bit young rather than queenly), but I like her hand raised as a sign of farewell, suggesting that her thoughts are with the heroes as they journey into danger.

I was really hoping we'd get art depicting Galadriel throwing down the walls of Dol Guldur, but, alas.

I wish Magali would do more Star Wars and Netrunner

 

I actually prefer the alt art Galadriel

It's pretty tough to do better than Magali. 

I also commented that the alt-art Galadriel looks like Scarlett Johansen. I swear she was the base for this new Galadriel and also for Imladris Stargazer.

Scarlet Johansen is a good muse
