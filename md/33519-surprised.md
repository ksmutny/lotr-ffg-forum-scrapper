I can only say that I was not expecting a cooperative LCG. Stunned.

My goodness, FFG just keeps it coming one-two punch! So many new games in the pipeline.

For me, cooperative also means "playable solo!", which this one is, being a 1-2 player game.

What surprises me on this one is that it is yet one more game FFG is putting out in a summer already filled with new offerings can you imagine the kind of sales FFG might be getting come Christmas time this year?

 I'm pretty pumped for this.  I really hope they have demos or something about it at GenCon!

This is beyond awesome!!!  I am Tolkien fanatic, and have boatloads of the old 1990s Middle-Earth CCG which was also playable solo but not co-op.

And co-op, now that is just too awesome!

This may be my 1st and only LCG!

Another LCG! between this and Warhammer Invasion how am I going to have the money/time to get other games.

I would get into the other LCGs but his one seems better IMO, and I like to start with it instead of trying to catch up on years of packs. I will definatley keep an eye on this one.

I have been hoping for a fantasy based coop RPG for a long time!  I can't wait to see more info...

## 8 [guest530780 on August 3, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33519-surprised/?do=findComment&comment=337215)

The product info says monthly 60-card add-ons, which (I think) is about on par with FFG's other LCG's.

And with two core sets it's playable by 4 players, another good selling point.

With all of FFG's game announcements it is becoming increasingly difficult to decide about my planned game purchases.

This is awesome and exactly what I needed. I recently got back into WoW tcg and got bored of it fast again. Warhammer invasion has lost its appeal to, but this. I am a HUGE tolkien lore fan and the fact that this can be played solo and is cooperative is awesome. This will be great for a rainy day and I can even get the fiancee to play since its not competitive.

I think we can all agree this was expected to happen, an LOTR card game was going to happen.  But something on this scale and with this magnitude we could never have expected or seen.  I for one am buying game with out a doubt.  Ive been on the fence about a few games like dragonsheart and dungeonquest but this.....this is going to be in my game collection asap.

 Toq: As a WoW TCG player and a lover of its lore you may find the Warhammer game to your liking in both style and game play.

Now, not having PLAYED the LotR LCG, I'm totally unjustified in that conclusion. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Also, no offense to Nate.

## 13 [Toqtamish on August 4, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33519-surprised/?do=findComment&comment=337701)

already play the warhammer game. have since it came out. As I said, its lost its appeal however.

## 14 [thorondor on August 4, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33519-surprised/?do=findComment&comment=337787)

i already guessed that LOTR would be the next LCG, and i am glad its true.

though it will be very hard to top the old MECCG!

 

@frog: still playing meccg? wanna get some infos, then just me a line at thorondor@gmx.at
