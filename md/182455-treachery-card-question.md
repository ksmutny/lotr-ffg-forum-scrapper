Do these resolve immediately as in theres no playing cards from my hand to stop events? This is my first time playing and what happened was I had Gloin questing and pulled a treachery card for the staging area that said "+1 damage to all exhausted characters" this would kill Gloin because he already had 3 damage. However I had a card in my hand and the resources availible that would ready Gloin and relieve him of the damage. Is this playable or is he dead?

 

Thanks,

Welcome to the game! I will try to answer your question.

 

There are several limitations on when you can play cards.

1. Allies and Attachments can only be played during the planning phase.

2. Events can be played during any phase.

 

On various Allies, Attachments, and Events you may notice there are Actions and Responses. These are different.

1. Actions can only be triggered during a valid window for player actions.

2. Responses interrupt the flow of the game, and the only restriction is that they must be triggered immediately after the condition specified on the card. If you continue on with the game in any way then it is too late to go back and trigger the response.

 

So when are the valid window for player actions? This is something that took a while for me to learn, and when you are starting out it helps to have a reference handy. There is a chart at the end of the rulebook but it isn't very detailed. I've been using this: http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf]

 

As you can see the staging step is all red, meaning no Actions can be triggered while the cards are being revealed. The only thing you can do is trigger appropriate Responses, like Eleanor or Test of Will. A passive effect, like the one on Thalin, will also work.

 

Now, there are exceptions to these rules, like when an enemy makes an attack as part of its "when revealed" effect (this opens up the opportunity to perform actions), but generally the cards themselves will let you know.

 
Again, welcome to the game and to the community!

Thanks to both of you for the responses. Been getting crushed with just the core leadership deck, but enjoying it non the less. So hopefully as I start more deck building the victories will come.

That's the only way to do it! And remember : "LOTR LCG is the game where you learn to lose." (Sean from COTR)

and also i found i git hammered with core single sohere decks but much better with constructed multi sphere decks and even better still when your card pool expands from extra expansions.

so enjoy losing, but also look forward to getting better too.

such an awesome game, welcome!

it has such a steep learning curve. some decisions i made in early days i would never risk now and ive only been playing about four months.

truly awesome game (but so hard at first)
