On this Khazad-dum quest.

 

Goblin Swordsman as a shadow card is added to the staging area.

 

Am I right in thinking the engaging phase is already over and he was revealed in the combat phase. Therefore he won't be able to attack until next round, but I can attack him as a target in the staging area (Dunhere)?

 

Many thanks on helping me resolve this one.

You are correct.
