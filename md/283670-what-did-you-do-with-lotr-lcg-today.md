# [What did you do with Lotr LCG today?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/)

I'm sort of trying to create a thread similar to those on car forums. Basically, you state what you have done with the game. Did you play? If so, what quest and how did it go? Did you buy new expansions or adventure packs? Did you buy new sleeves? Did you re-organize your cards or working on a new storage/organizer solution? Anything that you did related to the game, you can share in this thread. I'm looking to create a thread that hopefully gets updated daily so we have something to read about every day. I'm curious to find out what you all do with Lotr LCG.

To start off, last night I built the encounter deck for the 2nd Khazad-dum quest, The Seventh Level.

This morning I ordered the On the Doorstep playmat from FFG. It should arrive next week. I might even hold off on playing the 2nd Khazad-dum quest until it arrives, since I'm using a Dwarf deck for the quests :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I replay the rhovanion deluxe in solo with a mono tactics deck. I still try to figure out how to build this deck so it work for the best. I plan to play against harder quest (cycle 7 and/or nightmare) later.

Which heroes are you using in your mono tactics deck?

With my limited card pool, my mono tactics deck has Beregond, Eowyn and Legolas, though I have not been able to test the deck yet. Once I'm done with the Khazad-dum quests, I'll give the mono tactics deck a try with the core set quests.

Eowyn / Hirgon / Theoden. Mablung could sneak instead of Theoden if I feel I need more resources than starting willpower. I don't really have faith in a Beregond/Eowyn/Legolas deck in solo, since tactics ally lack also willpower. You need to be very lucky ^^.

I was playing my Stereotypical Eagles Deck as an extra run for the solo league.  Since it had taken 21 and 20 tokens for the first two quest, I started at 24 tokens for Return to Mirkwood -- not good enough, since I threated out.  32 tokens -- Attercop did me in.  40 tokens -- victory!

Next play will be with 36 tokens.

I've always found the best tactic in normal Journey in the Dark (nightmare stops this strategy entirely) is to win before the Balrog ever even appears. Make sure you cancel any copies of Fool of a Took that appear even if you have to use Ho! Tom Bombadil!

The part that is worse than the balrog is the 2 burdens that neutralize 2 of your 3 heroes.  Losing 2 thirds of your core strength is brutal

Grievous Wound and the other one?

Good strategies for those: Repeatable healing can negate grievous wound and the other condition can be avoided by never chump blocking in this quest.  Condition removal is a good alternative as well.

Yeah I thought burdens were not considered condition attachments, that makes things a lot easier!  Finally killed that Balrog though, what a tough and long series of failures to do it though, thanks for clarifying that for me!

You need to be really powerful at questing in order to do that. But since it even prevent you for gain any burden it definitely worth a shot :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

I’m still exploring my card pool, building new decks and testing them out. I’m planning on having a solid deck list before shelving the game a little bit, since I’ve been playing it for months, neglecting my other games. Problem is, I’m about 30 decks in, and still not seeing the end of it. The replayability is probably infinite.

Also planning on reading the rules reference this afternoon.

I finished my extra run with the Eagles deck.  Finished with 74 tokens.  Apparently with enough help from the Valar anything is possible.

Trying to explore a different part of the card pool this week! I am playing with Arden/Galdor/Ramrod

I am trying to build a deck that cycles fast (then uses will of the west) , but giving me a little bit of control more than Erestor does.

I started by playing coreset and mirkwood cycle nightmare decks. Dol guldur seems unbeatable. I am trying hard to beat conflict at the car rock nightmare ATM. Needs a bit of luck.

I'm taking a vaguely thematic pair of decks through The Lost Realm and Angmar Awakened cycle:

Aragorn/Halbarad/Elrohir and Erestor/Arwen/Elladan

Tonight I got through The Treachery of Rhudaur without too much sweat, picking up a clue for each deck and loading up an excessive 25 damage on Thaudir in the final stage. Now for the hard stuff: Carn Dum and The Dread Realm...

Closest finale so far was a replay of Deadman's Dike (after I realised a play error on the previous win) which ended with one deck at 1 card remaining in it's deck ?

I have no doubt I will most likely struggle with willpower with my mono tactics deck. I'm hoping Eowyn plus a few unique allies will be enough to successfully quest every round.

---------------------------------------------------

Not today, but last Saturday I ended up playing the 2nd Khazad-dum quest, The Seventh Level. I am using a tri-sphere Dwarf deck with Dain, Bifur and Gimli. I got the deck from RingsDB and tweaked it to remove non-thematic cards like Steward of Gondor, Daughter of Nimrodel, etc... It was a really fun play through. I won on my first try, but just barely. The 2nd stage of the quest does a good job of simulating a horde of Goblins/Orcs coming at you while you try to make your escape. There was a stretch of 2-3 rounds where I had 3 engaged enemies and not enough bodies to block them. Dain can block at least twice because I had Erebor Record Keeper in play and I had Veteran of Nanduhirion to block the 3rd enemy. However I only had Gimli to kill off the enemies. Thankfully I had Feints and Sneak Attack on my hand and somehow, managed to fend off the enemy. Some attacks I took undefended and Dain would have been dead, if he didn't have Self Preservation on him. I was extremely lucky to not  have faced the Cave Trolls as they all showed up as Shadow cards.

At 47 threat, with 3 engaged enemies, I used Sneak Attack to bring in another Veteran of Nanduhirion to block an enemy, instead of Feint, so I would have one more attacker in addition to Gimli. Using Sneak Attack triggered Legacy of Durin and the card I drew was Gandalf! I was so happy since I was worried I was going to threat out, not to mention the horde of enemies kept coming. I now realize that I would have drawn him anyway in the next round but during that time, I was ecstatic LOL. With Gandalf in play, I was finally able to win the game.

Played a tense game of Nightmare Drowned Ruins last night, thought I might lose from threat but managed to pull out a victory in the end. Had two copies of Guardian of the Golden King engaged with my combat deck at the end and because the first player's deck was empty they were invulnerable to damage!! Luckily I was only a turn away from potential victory.

There are some REALLY nasty treacheries in the Nightmare version of this quest! Corrupted Flora is potentially the worst!

Also made some minor deck changes to both my decks. Have been using proxies of the new Warrior Sword as well as Swift and Strong. Swift and Strong can be banana's strong in the right situations and it gives one **** of an offensive combat boost.

My On the Doorstep playmat arrived yesterday, but I was so busy I didn't even get to unpack it. Hopefully I will have time to play tonight. I'm thinking I might replay the 2nd Khazad-dum quest a few more times, before I move to the 3rd quest. I'm equally curious and scared, to see how I would fare if the Cave Trolls showed up as enemies on the 2nd quest :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I did playtest my mono tactics day several day ago. I need to make some change but he his interesting. Now I'm testing for the solo league, with the objective to claim a 0 valor point and perfect tiebreaker record (like the previous time but without wasting my shot against nightmare this time ^^).

I unpacked the On the Doorstep play mat and played a few games on it, though the games I played weren't Lotr LCG. Either way, it makes exhausting/tapping cards really easy because of the play mat surface. The graphic/photo on the play mat is not as detailed as I would like. It looks good when looking at it from farther away, not too much when looking at it up close, but that seems to be a common complaint with play mats. It is still a lot better playing on it, than playing on a bare table or a table cloth that causes the cards to snag when trying to tap them.

Looking to get back into playing Lotr LCG this week.

Started playing the 2nd Khazad-dum quest last night; The Seventh Level. After setup I turn the quest card to 1B and reveal Watchful Eyes. Okay so I attach this to Dain who has Book of Mazarbul, which turns out be a mistake. (I should have attached Book of Mazarbul to Bifur my quester, since he won't be attacking, which means I could also have attached Watchful Eyes on him and not have to reveal an extra card at the end of the combat phase.) Anyways, I already made the mistake and attached Watchful Eyes to Dain. During the quest phase, the encounter deck revealed an enemy, which meant that Dain had to block, which meant that I revealed another card from the encounter deck at the end of the combat phase. The card I revealed was another Watchful Eyes. **** Sauron was not taking any chances last night LOL. Anyway, before I got to decide who to attach it to, I got interrupted by my 2 year old who wanted me to read to him. And so I had stopped there and never got to finish the game last night. I left the game on the table as is and will continue tonight.

Finally finished that game from Monday night. I probably played 1 turn Tuesday night before being interrupted again. Anyways, on turn 3, because of Watchful Eyes on Dain, I revealed the Orc Horn Blower. That guy, sucks! He then proceeded to fill the staging area with locations and from that point on, I could barely keep up. I stopped playing when I was at 48 threat and another Watchful Eyes showed up, which meant all 3 heroes would have had it. I have Miner of the Iron Hills but he was probably stuck in a tavern drinking ale, he never showed up. At that point I had like 4-5 locations in the staging area and not enough willpower to successfully quest so I called it a night. Am eager to play the quest again over the weekend.

You see your first mistake: Bifur should get the book and every watchful eyes after that.

But even if it don't, you should have stack all the watchful eyes on a single hero and accept not to touch him after that. Do you have the opportunity to let the first enemy you reveal on undefended attack? It can be risky but having to reveal additional encounter card is risked too so it could have been better.

Good luck if you retry :).

To my own I decide to post a solo deck with a core set, based on my recent experience on the 2 solo league: http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/124001 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/124001]

Just sleeved Roam Across Rhovanion, received two weekend ago.

Then, I have played THE BLACK SERPENT and with a final attack of 16, it is defeated during the 13th round, after 3 and a half hours of play on the first try after a long time I did not play it. A really really tough and difficult scenario. It took me eight rounds just to get through the first scene. One of those scenarios where you really need to think well about every move and what you can get to meet. Very beautifull! Final score 190

My bad. This technique work pretty well with others conditions, like caught in the web. You usually you prefer to let aside only one hero for the rest of the game. It increase by a lot his chance to die on an undefended attack though, since you only loose a half hero (the production resource). It can even be the best situation to free him with a fortune or fate ^^.

Yeah unfortunately Watchful Eyes is limited to 1 per hero. I did not think of stacking the same conditions on just one hero though, thanks for sharing that idea.

---------------------------

I played the same quest again over the weekend. This time I had book of Mazarbul on Bifur and put Watchful Eyes on him when it showed up. For some the reason, in the last 2 games I played, Miner of the Iron Hills and Gandalf never showed up. Which is unfortunate, because I always had Sneak Attack on my hand. Anyways, this play through ended badly. I got overrun by Goblins and Orcs. I got my wish and battled with a Cave Troll. They are as fearsome in battle as I expected. Dain with Self Preservation held him off for a few rounds, but I just did not have enough attacking power to take it down as there were other enemies I was engaged with. At 49 threat, I knew I was gonna lose, I focused on taking down the Cave Troll before the end. I played two Khazad! Khazad! cards on Gimli, who already had 4 damage tokens on him and he was able to take out the Cave Troll in one blow. Of course I failed the quest after the combat phase.

My problem with this quest seems to be clearing locations. I don't have enough Dwarves available for combat, because I have to let them quest. At most, I am just barely keeping up with questing. I am going to see if I can make improvements to my deck before I move on to the last Khazad-dum quest.

Yesterday, I found time to play LotR LCG for the first time in a year (my previous game was on October 13, 2017, vs. Escape from Mount Gram... couldn't believe that much time had passed)!

Man did it ever feel good to get back to the game.

I played Across the Ettenmoors 2-handed progression style and won on first try, so I was very pleased with that. Deck 1 was Aragorn (Lore), Elrond and Mirlonde, and deck 2 was Glorfindel (Sp), Rossiel and Balin. Far from thematic, but whatever. ?

I beat Voyage across Beleagar with my Stereotypical Noldor deck (non-Erestor edition).  I only managed to kill one enemy with the help of Nenya, but power-quested through the stages quickly with my Noldor army.

Just been reading the forums. Looking up cards on cardgamedb.com. I'm going to try to sneak away and pick up the Mountain of Fire saga box today- it's the last saga box that I'm missing.

PIcked up Roam Across Rhovanion. Planning to add some of the cards to my deck and hopefully get a game in later.

Got another 2-handed progression victory vs. Across the Ettenmoors, then tried straight solo progression using Aragorn (Lo)/Elrond/Glorfindel (Sp), and won again. I'm undefeated against this quest so far, which is a great way to get back into the game (right now, I'm in need of a morale boost, especially given how hard I've heard the later APs in this cycle are... otherwise, I'm fine with the challenge presented by repeat defeats).

You've chosen a proper quest for morale boost. Others from that cycle tend to be annoyingly difficult.

Last night I spent time on RingsDb fine tuning my main Dwarf deck and coming up with an alternate Dwarf deck, for taking on the Khazad-dum quests. My main Dwarf deck has Bifur, Dain and Gimli. The alternate deck has Bifur, Dwalin and Dain. I'm worried about not having enough attacking power without Gimli, but I'm also gaining some useful cards from the Spirit Sphere and auto threat reduction with Dwalin. I'm excited to see how it fares.

If I was you I will be worried about playing 2 Dain. Even if it surely could be much valuable to get twice is effect ^^. I guess you got wrong in the name of a hero in one of the two ;).

I think he means that he is designing two different decks with Dain for solo play (one primary, one alternate), not two decks to be used simultaneously.

Oh sure. It make sense now that I read his post again ^^.

I don't know what part of the cardpool you get but so far I always managed to play without tactics in dwarf. So I have many allies that does great the attack task. I do prefer Nori over Dwalin though but you may haven't buy the hobbit saga yet.

Tried Journey Along the Anduin for the second time - I was on my way to winning when a Treachery killed Eowyn, man, it all went downhill fast from there. Treacheries can be brutal; and those stupid little Goblin Snipers can do some unwanted damage if you don't clear out the staging area fast...

Now, that's an impressive win. You should be well-suited for Escape from Dol Guldur.

Be warned that Escape from Dol Guldur is absolutely brutal solo. It can be beaten solo using core set cards only (though you may want to proxy multiples of cards appearing in less than triplicate in the core set, like Unexpected Courage), but it'll take incredible luck to succeed and it will feel like you're bashing your head against a brick wall... how strong is your head? 

It's far more enjoyable two-handed or with two players, and really scales badly for solo, even if you play on easy mode.

Incredible luck? Nay. I can pull off a consistent 15-20%. But I've played this quest multiple times before (as evidenced). I agree it scales poorly for solo.

Solo with a 50-card deck of Core only cards? My win ratio was closer to 5%... and a critical factor in success was which of the three heroes ended up as prisoner during set-up. Not sure how you would achieve a 15-20% win ratio under those conditions, but if you have, wow, congrats! Evidently did better 2-handed and 2-player than I did solo.

After scoring a couple of solo progression wins against Across the Ettenmoors, I played 4 straight solo games of The Treachery of Rhudaur these past couple of days, winning the last two with Elrond/Mirlonde/Glorfindel(Sp). Will play the next few games two-handed.

Just ordered The Wilds of Rhovanion and The Withered Heath, and then also the first AP in the Haradrim cycle, The Mumakil. I thought taming an Oliphant (afrikaans for elephant I think is where Tolkien got that name) sounded like something I might enjoy and a change from the from the usual quests. I'm going in blind so don't spoiler too much if commenting.

Well, it was around 45%, and I chose my prisoner each game. So dividing the results by three to account for the other heroes theoretically being chosen as prisoner as often nets 15%, with a small increase in case I won several games with a different hero as prisoner.

The Nazgul of Dol Guldur flipped me the bird when I tried to invoke the laws of probability and apply them to random prisoner draw. ?

Thus far I have played only two games on OCTGN:

My second one was testing my new deck with Bard the Bowman, Spirit Beregond and Spirit ´`Éowyn against Intruders in Chetwood, the other game was Dénethor, `Éowyn and Aragorn against Dol Guldur with Denethor as the prisoner.

Decklist with cards from three core sets:

Heroes:

Denethor, Aragorn, Éowyn

Allies:

Northern Tracker, Longbeard Orc-slayer, Faramir, Gandalf, Snowbourn Scout, Wandering Took

Attachments:

The Favor of the Lady, Steward of Gondor, Power in the Earth, Celebrían's Stone, Unexpected Courage

Events:

Radagast's Cunning, A Test of Will, Hasty Stroke, Sneak Attack, For Gondor!, The Galadhrim's Greeting

Every card is three times in the deck (I guess this would not qualify as single core) and the deck has 51 cards total. Radagast's Cunning is the only Lore card in there and to be played once Denethor is free and the Nazgul is in the staging area. Obviously this deck can only work, when Denethor is the prisoner.

I managed to win this game, although it's been quite a while and I no longer remember the details.

It was a variation on this deck idea, sideboarded to only include core set cards: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5701/escape-from-dol-guldur-solo-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5701/escape-from-dol-guldur-solo-1.0]

Been trying The Mumakil. First game I almost made it, I had captured the Mumak and just needed a few more progress on the quest and then I got the Terrible Fever treachery and I died a slow death. If only I hadn't used my Test of Will on another Treachery.

The other 2 times I tried I got terrible location lock and my threat skyrocketed. I did manage to remove Terrible Fever with Miner of the Iron Hills this time though, which I was happy with. Ah well, soldier on I will.

Just won The Steward's Fear two handed since i couldn't find a way to win one-handed. Think this was my 6th or 7th attempt.

One outlands deck and the other, mostly tactics and a bit of lore for healing and card draw. Beregond as main tank (with gondorian shield + citadel plate) and Gimli with ring mail and song of mocking for solid damage.

The outland deck was led by Aragorn (core) with Narsil (a sword that was broken) and Celebrian's stone, Hirluin The Fair (of course!) with Steward of Gondor (to flood the play area with outlanders) and sprifindel. Solid deck, really enjoyed the "sliver" aspect of the outlands trait so far. Will try it with new outlands cards in the future.

This scenario was really challenging, but not near as frustrating as "Into Ithilien" (toughest scenario in the game so far, imho), which by the way i never succeeded at in perhaps 15 or 20 attempts. My best run was a failure on the final push, threat busted 50. I bitterly took it as a win and moved on =(

Cool variable plot and boss aspect to the SF scenario. One of my favourites so far ?

Nightmare level looks really nasty at first glance.

Now to the Drúadan Forest!

Finished my progression-style run against The Treachery of Rhudaur today. As an additional handicap, I haven't been using any LotR Saga cards as part of my progression plays (I have all the saga boxes, but they're still in shrink-wrap and will remain so until I decide to play through the entire saga ? ). 

Ended up playing 22 games, 10 solo (Aragorn L/ Elrond/Glorfindel S), and 12 two-handed (Elrond/Mirlonde/Rossiel; Glorfindel S/Galadriel/Idraen). Won 33% of my straight solo games, 25% of my 2-handed games. 

Guess my decks weren't the most reliable (e.g., Galadriel struggling to find Nenya in several games, and Imladris Stargazers that just wouldn't turn up), but when the engines worked as intended, they were solid.  

I'm both apprehensive and excited to go against The Battle of Carn Dum next, given the reputation that AP has.

In my experience, when the picture depicts Gandalf holding Glamdring or riding on Shadowfax, it is always about the digital game. If it is a totally new one you have not seen before, it is most likely not about the digital game.

Played against a warg/troll custom encounter deck using the cards from Wizard's Quest and Woodland Realm. I only played it once, but those wargs were relentless! A lot of the them have effects that key off having a shadow card with no shadow effect, so many kept bouncing back to the staging area or making additional attacks. Very annoying. In fact 11 of the 35 cards have no shadow effects. The subtle design from Caleb to have it be so synergistic using quick build mode is quite impressive. (I quick build using these seven encounter set: 6, 11, 12, 16, 22, 23, 28).

Going to try out the other encounter decks later this week, one with spiders, another with orcs, and the last one being an evil deck of doomed and surging nonsense and a Nazgul. All 4 of these are built at once (no shared cards), so that's awesome. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Replaced The Old Forest and Fog on the Barrow-downs with their German versions, for some reason the latter have sligthly different colours but are cut more precise.

Haven't been able to play for awhile due to busy nights, but am looking to play a game tonight. Last night I readied my deck and encounter deck with the intent of playing tonight. After winning my first try at the 2nd Khazad-dum quest, I have lost 4-5 in a row I think. Either way, I will play it once more and move on to the 3rd quest regardless if I win or lose.

I have found that restricting myself to thematic decks is making it hard for me to win in Moria. (I also don't have the patience to mulligan for the perfect opening hand before I start playing. I just want to start playing, if you know what I mean.) The good thing here is that the restrictions are ones I came up with and not one the game forces on you. So there is nothing stopping me from entering Moria with Spirit Glorfindel riding on Asfaloth, or putting on Steward of Gondor on everyone else who does not have a Gondor trait, or including Forest Snare in my deck (because there is no forest inside Moria), if I really want to. I might just try that on my next playthrough, just for fun.

Finally got around to playing a Dale deck against Roam across Rhovanion. It's been a while as The Withered Heath was super-tough for some reason. In contrast, this one went down in the first try. A nice respite after slogging through The Withered Heath over the past couple of weeks.

Got repeatedly spanked playing The Battle of Carn Dum, 2-handed, progression-style, standard difficulty. Tried a bunch of different decks, but it took no time to figure out their weaknesses the hard way. ?

Yes, I know I could look up successful deck combos, and no, I don't want any advice... I like figuring these things out myself.

May have to set the quest aside for a few days, though, as it's seriously been distracting me from my work... it's all I can think about!

Beat Celebrimbor's Secret. It was a tough one with all the surge I was hitting but got it done! Then I sleeved up The Antlered Crown and retooled my deck in prep for the last quest. Made me wish we had gotten a Dunlending/Wildman hero. There's gotta be some rebels in their midst that rejected the evil ways of the Enemy.

Just completed a 78-game, Battle of Carn Dum marathon (standard difficulty, progression-style, respecting latest errata for Love of Tales) that began on November 6. Six games were two-handed, lost them all. The remaining 72 games were straight solo, and I only won twice (maybe three times, but had a feeling I made errors in one game... so two it is). And I'll admit it, in three games, I gave myself my "perfect" 11-card starting hand (was mostly playing a Bilbo/Erestor/Mirlonde variant of Seastan's song deck), which resulted in one win , one loss, and one game aborted due to errors. The one win in that context felt dirty, but at least it reconfirmed that victory was possible... if the cards aligned.

So in the end, only 1 victory when playing 100% by the rules. That's way worse than my straight solo 50-card Core set win ratio vs. Escape From Dol Guldur!  The vast majority of games were lost within the first five rounds. 

What a soul-crushing quest. Glad I won (and the victory was epic and hard fought), but I don't know if I have the energy to go through this again to achieve a 2-handed progressive-style victory in standard mode.

Finally got to playing again last night. One last try at the 2nd Khazad-dum quest and the Dwarves were successful yay! My record is now 2 wins and 4 losses for this quest. The addition of Ancestral Knowledge helped a lot with locations that used to slow me down in previous games. Getting Erebor Record Keeper and Blade of Gondolin out on the first round certainly helped as well. The Dwarves faced off a Cave Troll on the first stage of the quest, which nearly killed Dain, but thankfully Gandalf showed up just in time to help them slay it.

After last night's play, seeing how Ancestral Knowledge helped me win and from reading the posts from people on here, I am now going to change how I'm building my decks. Everyone else might be doing this already, but for some reason I never thought of doing it this way. I've always built decks by adding cards that I like or cards that fit a theme I like, regardless of what pack/expansion/cycle they come from. So now, I'm going to try building decks by first looking at cards that belong to the pack/expansion/cycle whose quest I am going to be playing. So like for the Khazad-dum quests, I rebuilt my deck by first looking at Khazad-dum cards, which also meant that they almost always fit the theme of the quest, selecting those that I like to play. Then I looked at cards from the Core se and picked those that I liked. Then only then did I look at cards belonging to other unrelated packs/expansions/cycle. I feel like this results in a deck that is more suited to playing the quest at hand, which I guess is why people like playing progression style.

Anyway, looking forward to playing the last Khazad-dum quest soon.

Finally played A Storm on Cobas Haven and City of Corsairs. The final boss fight against Sahir was epic and satisfying, kept on the razor's edge till the last turn. I have to say it's the boss fight I have enjoyed the most so far, together with the one against Durin's Bane in Shadow and Flame (I still have to play the Print on Demand quests though).

1st post from a LOTR LCG noob...

Session reports:

11/23 - Played with 2 very experienced players last Friday night.  Had 2 quaint core set decks with a couple mirk cycle cards.  Couldn't draw steward with my lead/lore deck, couldn't get citadel plate with my spirit/tactics deck.  Was enlightening watching my two companions put out 97 cards on turn 1 planning phase while I gave the ole blackjack 'im sticking.'  They won the encounter despite me much like my wife drove her new car home to ask me what the smell was… and then I discovered the E brake on…  massing at osgiliath was even worse.  I was as useless as mammaries on a beorning.  Went home and kicked a puppy.  Still lots of fun!

11/25 – afternoon.  Let my 8yr old little shaver have a go at conflict at the carrock.  Played 3 games.  Lost em all.  One he lost questing too fast.  One he lost questing too slow.  The last he threated out.  He had dispatched one troll and Gandalf was coming in to help finish off another.  Then he drew the brown lands in the questing phase and he couldn't get rid of the carrock active location.  We had a blast.  Will try again tonight.

11/25 – late night.  Reworked my crappy decks.  Remade a lead/lore deck for my first foray into Khazad-Dum expansion quest 'into the pit.'  Tried to get creative.  This is another way of saying I don't really know what I'm doing but I know better than to drive with the E brake on.  Heroes were berevor, bifur, and gloin.  Drew steward in my opening hand and I was feeling fat n sassy for the first time in 7 games.  Drew sudden pitfall during the questing phase and bifur was gone.  Ugh.  Well, resource smoothing is so overrated… (?)  decided to keep at it, and my reward was drawing watchful eyes.  I'm hot with the draw.  Vegas Baby!  Two turns later, drew miner of the iron hills.  Got rid of watchful eyes (golly, are there no hills left to climb?).  brought out gildor and haldir.  Berevor, in a touching ESB carbonite scene moment, says to gildor, 'I love you,' and gildor, questing for 3 replies, 'I know.'  Guard of the citadel, daughter of the nimrodel, and faramir follow, and all of a sudden I'm questing!  2B has me put out a patrol leader.  That fat n sassy feeling hits again as I sneak attack Gandalf during the questing phase.  But like tommy boy with his dinner roll sale, I draw an enemy off the encounter deck and no damage.  Ugh.  Where's that puppy again?  I sacrifice guard of the citadel, raise my threat to 46, and read the quest card very carefully.  I interpret it to mean if I get 11 progress I move on, regardless of enemies (please correct me if im wrong!).  So I put Gandalf in regular way next turn and quest with every hero and ally I have.  If it doesn't work, I will lose.  It works, and I move on to 3B (I think).  Quest with everyone again and barely escape…  

If this is TL:DR, or not interesting, let me know.  I don't post much anywhere on the net.  I am a-okay just lurking.  Really enjoy reading this board and others for help, tips, and inspiration.  Good luck to you all!

Last Friday, I played the last Khazad-dum quest, Flight from Moria. I played 4 times, lost/conceded 4 times. Splendid!

I am playing one handed solo with a tri-sphere Dwarf deck led by Bifur, Dain and Gimli.

My first attempt at it, I drew a bad hand and still had a bad hand after a mulligan. During the first round I could not play any allies. I drew Chieftain of the Pit during staging. I did not have anything in my hand that could stop the Chieftain from attacking. Whether or not I block the attack, a hero will die anyway. And since the Nameless Fear is going to be sitting in the staging area, I felt like I could not win with 1 less hero, so I conceded.

My second attempt at it, I also somewhat drew a bad hand and could not play allies during the first round. I drew Sudden Pitfall which means I would have lost Bifur or Gimli, so I conceded again.

I do not remember how I lost my 3rd or 4th attempts, I just know that I didn't get past round 3 LOL. Either way, this Flight from Moria quest is tough and like Escape from Dol Guldur, is going to be very hard to beat playing one-handed solo.

Finch,

thanks for sharing...  I'm new to the game and have made it through 'into the pit' and 'seventh level.'  I was going to try 'flight from moria' in the next few days and your report helps.  escape from dol goldur and return to mirkwood (last mirkwood cycle quest) I couldn't beat solo one hand.  if I lose flight from moria a bunch I now know to move on to redhorn gate until I can find someone to play two handed with and help me out...

You can play in easy mode if you find the quest too hard. I don't remember it was this hard in easy mode, except one or two nasty treacheries. But this quest relies a bit on luck to win. I still find Escape from dol guldur harder in solo play (at least, you start Flight from moria with your three heroes)

It's obviously possible to have really bad luck playing the Khazad-Dum quests, but I don't remember it being anywhere nearly as hard as Escape From Dol Guldur and Return to Mirkwood. Bad starting hands evidently don't help. As I recall (and I think it's been 3 years or so since I played Khazad-Dum/Dwarrowdelf), The Redhorn Gate was way harder than Flight From Moria.

I now remember how I lost my 3rd and 4th attempts. I progressed to Stage 2B and it was Blocked by Shadow. Both times, I risked it by drawing a card, and both times I drew Treachery cards, fml. I think I've been really unlucky with it. I'll give the quest another go on the weekend.

We ended up winning it more easily than Escape From Umbar (ended it during the combat phase turn 5 at 32 temperature), but we play a 4 mono-sphere decks fellowship, and the Lore deck has a heavy focus on healing so I guess that made it easier for us (also we built the fellowship around the Gondor trait and Visionary Leadership so we are able to get quite quickly a huge quest output even while mantaining a good combat focus) than normal.

And also The Long Arm of Mordor is behind us. We won once again at the first try (as with Escape from Umbar and Desert Crossing) and we quite liked the unique twist and mechanic of the quest (even though it unvalidated lot of our usual strategies).

Finally got to start playing The Mountain of Fire. Cirith Ungol kept us busy all afternoon and we finally defeated it at the third attempt, in quite the epic game which was hard fought till the end and assisted by a little luck with the player draws. It really conveys the difficulty of the situation and the mechanics are really thematic (and **** those Two Watchers).

And now we fought an amazingly tight game against The Black Gate Opens at the second try (after a very quick first loss during the first try) and managed to ****** up an eight resource with a very lucky appareance of Gwahir as a shadow card in the combat phase of the last turn which left a single hero standing. I think it's quite the good result so we will record it in the campaign log to try then Mount Doom.

Built an Isengard doomed deck that uses Orthanc guard as a primary defender.

Elven-light plus Protector of Lorien plus Steward of Orthanc gives essentially Deep Knowledge on demand (which translates into on-  demand readying), while Wild Stallion, Ancestral Armor, and ally Arwen give it enough defense to be effective in that role.

Kind of fun, actually.

Took apart a couple of decks as I prepared for a get-together next weekend, until toddlers distracted me. Later on I tinkered with a mono-lore combat control deck I've been messing with for several days, and finally published it. Then I played 2-handed Journey Down the Anduin using my tactics-lore Hobbit combat deck and a Dale deck and handily defeated it.

Played Journey in the dark, won twice, killed the Balrog once. Non Campaign, Galadriel made the ultimate sacrifice. 

Looked at my log to see what I'd played last year December 11th, it was Nin en Eliph, so I was only in the 4th cycle of my progression. Kinda cool. Memories.

Been so busy at work, hardly have time to check the forums. Anyway, I made another attempt at the Flight from Moria quest and lost again when I drew a Treachery card while resolving the Blocked by Shadow quest card effect. Obviously I need some way to know what the top card of the encounter deck is, before the staging step. For that, I retuned my deck and added Rumour from the Earth to help with that. I have not been able to play with the new deck yet. I might even add Henamarth Riversong if I get desperate after losing again. Thematically I can explain Henamarth's addition as the Dwarves hiring an elven scout to help them in Moria LOL.

Used some Xmas money to pick up The Grey Havens, The Sands of Harad, The Flame of the West and The Wilds of Rhovannion at my local game shop. Now to try and find the associated adventure packs and the remaining saga expansions.

I played the Withered Heath AP. Conceded twice.  Decided to try building another deck and play two handed.  I really appreciate this game now seeing the dynamics when playing with or as a second player

Last night I was able to do my 6th attempt at Flight from Moria. I had Rumour from the Earth in my hand for the start of the game. Things were looking good. I knew what the top card was on the encounter deck and was ready for the staging step. On Round 1, I revealed the Narrow Paths quest card. I didn't make any questing progress on Round 1, so I didn't get to trigger the forced effect, I thought I would make it a priority on the next round. Dain defended against a Stray Goblin and Gimli managed to do inflict 1 damage on it. Before the round ended, I played Rumour from the Earth again and knew that the next card coming was a location with 1 threat. I was feeling good.

So on to Round 2, I decided to quest with Bifur and Gimli for a total of 6 willpower. Staging step revealed the location which had 1 threat. The location plus The Nameless Fear had a total of 3 threat, so I quested successfully and proceeded to place the progress token on the quest card, which triggered the forced effect. Since the Abandoned Tools had the Guarded keyword, I ended up revealing Sudden Pitfall! Ouch. Now I had the fun decision of deciding which hero to discard, Bifur or Gimli. I decided to discard Bifur. Now I finish putting all progress tokens on the quest card and realized I completely finished that part of the quest, so now it gets to go to the victory display to add to The Nameless Fear's threat. At this early in the game, round 2, losing Bifur was a huge blow and I conceded at that point. Sauron wins again this time.

However I now have a good feeling that I can beat this quest soon. I just need to be wary of the Sudden Pitfall treachery card when questing. I had Erebor Record Keeper in play on Round 2, but decided to quest with Gimli instead, which was a big mistake. Should not be making that mistake next time.

It may not sound like much, but last night while I had some downtime at work and decided to challenge myself to the "play 10 games 10 times in a year" challenge. 

I haven't played since a Fellowship event in October, so I put this game on the list. I'm determined to get it to my table more frequently. In fact here's hoping I go well over 10 plays!

I've logged 83 plays this year alone so far hahaha. A good half of those are solo, lots of coop with my wife and 10 are four player multiplayer that we have been going through the Saga campaign. Excellent game!

In the last three days me and my girlfriend went throught the whole Haradrim cycle with our four mono-sphere decks (that have right now succesfully dealt with little changes with almost all the existing quests, we are tyring to beat them all). I think it might be the best cycle I ever played, even better than Wilds of Rhovanion and the Ered Mithrin cycle, both as narration and as quest mechanics. The Mumakil was the easiest quest for us and the most challenging (albeit still in a good and interesting way, not frustrating) was The Crossing of Poros. The Black Serpent was not nearly as difficult as I thought it would be by reading around.

In any case great fun, this game keeps just giving.

Awesome to hear! We recently finished Angmar Awakened and loved it, well after having to go super easy mode on Carn Dum. I'm very much looking forward to the Grey Havens adventures but nice to know that the future desert is also well told and executed! Is the story connected?

Yes, basically all the expansions starting from Heirs of Numenor tell a connected story, even though it really starts shining from The Grey Havens forward since the connection is especially strong between The Grey Havens -> Dream-chaser cycle -> The Sands of Harad -> Haradrim cycle -> Wilds of Rhovanion

When you say monosphere decks, I take it to mean that you will play one sphere while your girlfriend plays another sphere, right?

No, I mean each of us play two mono-sphere decks in a sort of double versione of two-handed solo. We basically play a 4 players fellowship, with each deck made with a single sphere, but it's only the two of us. I play one leadership deck and one lore one, she play the tactics and spirit ones. You can find the fellowship here [https://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/4933] (even though it's not the most updated version, there have been some additions and small twists); it's basically a big gondor swarm with lots of readying effects all across the table.

Oh, I see.  That sounds pretty ambitious.  

I was looking at your card list.  I didn't even realize there was a Boromir in Heirs of Numenor.  I have the box, but I haven't opened it yet lol.  I'm still working on the first cycle.

He usually is the centerpiece of our fellowship between its ability and Visionary Leadership. Beregond is another big part since it's the usual uber-defender of the table, while Elrond's ability to boost healing is unvaluable in helping clear all the damage spread around. We also often found Legolas ability to add progress outside the quest phase to be amazing since it lets us advance of stage during the combat phase avoiding some of the biggest troubles the encounter deck can throw at us so we preferred him as the main ranged attacker to other choices. The traps are also quite the big part of our play since they can provide quite the wide range of advantages. Furthermore using mono-sphere decks lets us use resources more freely and we can more easily afford "big" cards, not to mention some possibile only on mono-sphere (like Strenght of Arms which often can end up readying like 15-20 characters, or Advance Warning, not to mention Shadows Give Way which often ended up saving our butts even outside of Carn Dum). All in all it's been quite the fun playthrough for now, we only really had to change how the decks worked (albeit not the heroes) for Mount Doom.

As I had doubts about the "legitimacy" of my late 2018 progression mode victories over Battle of Carn Dum due to what I perceived to be some ambiguous rules situations, I decided to continue playing the quest in standard mode with the most recently available errata in effect, both straight solo and 2-handed, until I was satisfied that I had truly beaten the quest. 

What a time consuming endeavour (mistake?) that was... but the 4-month, 207 game marathon came to an end in the wee hours of this morning.

In that time, I managed a whopping 6 victories (lol)... you may snicker at my poor deck-building, strategic play, or sheer awful luck... and marvel at the sheer insanity of playing similar poorly performing decks over such a long period of time, and expecting better results of them! 

My two-handed decks featured Faramir (Lo)/Aragorn (Lo)/Frodo Baggins, and Glorfindel (Sp)/Erestor/Elrond.

For solo, I started out with  Bilbo Baggins/Erestor/Mirlonde (variation on a deck by Seastan), but eventually came to the conclusion that Faramir/Erestor/Glorfindel worked better and was more enjoyable... even though the overall win ratio remained dismal.

I was glad to have been able to make good use of cards that I had never found much use for in the past, such as Miruvor (Erestor really enables you to make the most of that one) and hero Faramir (Lo). 

Must admit that I'm happy that my OCD is finally allowing me to move on. I really hope The Dread Realm won't be nearly as painful...

Congratulations.  I actually gave up trying to beat Escape from Dol Guldur true solo with cards just from the Core Set.  Even though I know it can be done, because I've read that so many people have done it.  Still, a load off my back to move on.  I may circle back to it at some point, or I may not, I don't know.  It's not really that fun just hoping that your luck holds out, when the odds are so stacked against you.

Did you ever try the Elrond deck solo against Carn Dum?  I'd think that one might fare well (though I know not its contents) although I suspect Erestor might feed into Carn Dum's discard pile hate.

I think the community agrees Carn Dum is difficult.  I played it at least 40 times while working through it.  Good luck in The Dread Realm.  There's an interesting challenge that crops up in that one too.

Thank you. And I get where you're coming from, Vince. There can definitely be real relief when knowing when to let go, and that it isn't worth becoming soured on the whole game because of negative experiences with a particular quest.

I'm a "special kind of determined" (obsessive isn't too strong a word) when it comes to beating quests... and having a very flexible work schedule helps, too. 🙂 In the end, I think my "success" rate straight solo progression mode vs. Escape from Dol Guldur was a tiny bit better than my success rate vs. Carn Dum... but in both cases I pulled it off, and that's all that matters.

No, I did not try the Elrond deck solo vs. Carn Dum. I don't think I even used Vilya at all in the Elrond fellowship deck, just relied on him to be a solid second defender. In straight solo, I felt that the deck I used with Faramir/Erestor/Glorfindel was better as it was able to build Faramir into a mega battle quester/defender/wrecking ball much more effectively (using Songs, Love of Tales, Blood of Gondor, Gondorian Fire, Steward of Gondor, A Burning Brand, Miruvor, Unexpected Courage, Lembas, Wingfoot, etc., and striving to break even on questing in order to keep Accursed Battlefield as the active location as long as possible until I was ready to rush into and through Stage 2). 

I had never used hero Faramir before Carn Dum, and man was it a pleasure to discover just how awesome he is in battle quests (especially with Song of Kings/Steward of Gondor/Gondorian Fire attached), when enemies accumulate in staging due to ranger spikes and/or high engagement costs. 

But you are right regarding Erestor... while he was awesome for quickly putting into play low-cost attachments, he frequently got me into trouble as a result of treacheries forcing me to discard multiple/all copies of Will of the West and other key cards into the discard pile and/or Power of Angmar making it impossible to reshuffle or otherwise pull cards from the player discard pile. Still, I really liked the way he comboed with both Faramir and Glorfindel.

First deck i built for Carn Dum was with Faramir.  You have an enemy that won't leave the staging area so you start out with a stronger Faramir.  I may have to go back and try him against that quest again.  Funny enough I just finished Conflict at the Carrock (Nightmare) and that one also has enemies parked in the staging area.  I might have to go back to that one and try Faramir again.  I just want to make him work.

That's the beauty of Elrond. Even without Vilya, he's a quality hero that can contribute to willpower, defense, healing, and your engine.

Created a super fun 70 card deck featuring Gandalf/Elrond/Treebeard. 

Starts at threat 40 but lots of threat reduction and hits like a brick house whether Questing, Defending or Attacking. Easily one of the most fun teams I've tried out.

My FLGS finally got Celebrimbor’s secret in! This means that Eoywn leaves my elf deck and it gets tuned as Galadriel takes her rightful place with Elrond and (sp) Glorfindel. 

It slows the deck down a bit but really brings out the theme, so we will see how it works out!

EDIT: Sorry to add more, but I am actually really excited for my playing of this game right now. This week with the restock I bought a bunch of things that I didn't have. Did not get everything I hoped to but I know the aforementioned Elves will get a healthy bolster. The possibilities for deck creation are looking great!

Galadriel is great! My wife is currently running her with Aragorn and Arwen for a deadly half Noldor and half Dunedain deck. It's pretty deadly. Heir of Mardil is great on her when combined with Arwen for some readying fun

I played Shadow and Flame for the first time today. I've been playing progression style two-handed solo with an Aragorn/Theodred/Eowyn questing deck and a Legolas/Gimli/Beravor combat deck. Once the cards became available, I've stuffed a lot of Eagles into the combat deck along with Radagast.

I got really lucky, holding 2 Galadrim's Greetings and Steward of Gondor in my opening hand. That combined with Theodred's resource going to Eowyn, I was able reduce both hand's threat to 0 before combat to avoid the attacks in rounds 2 and 3. I just left all enemies in the staging area as the questing deck could still over-power the threat, meaning I could draw lots of cards with Beravor for the questing deck and Peace and Thought for the combat deck as I didn't need the combat deck at all early. This allowed me to draw the 3rd Galadrim's Greetings, Celebrian's Stone, and Dwarven Tomb. After using those tricks, I advanced to stage 3 during round 6 and Durin's Bane hadn't even attacked yet (the staging area had 4 or 5 low threat goblins, but I could quest for 15+ using only the questing deck so I just left them there). In stage 3, Durin's Bane obliterated a few allies including some eagles (which got tucked under The Eagles of the Misty Mountain to bump their attack to 5). The Misty Mountain Eagles (attacking for 5), Beravor (with Support of the Eagles attacking for 7), a couple Trollshaw Scouts, Gimli, Legolas, and Radagast chipping in made quick work of the Big Guy in only 2 rounds.

I can't imagine ever getting so lucky as to completely avoid all attacks for the first 5 rounds again, but it was a glorious conclusion to the Darrowdelf cycle.

I love dem birbs...

Opened and sleeved my haul from the latest restock including the last 3 Saga expansions I needed.

Also noticed today that I seem to be missing the first 3 Quest cards for The Lonely Mountain. Don't know where they went 😡 😭

I finally managed to check all my cards for translation errors and fixed them, then I included errata, clarifications and FAQs on many cards, so my sister can play with them without asking what they mean or breaking the rules unknowingly.

A vast portion of last week’s ordering has arrived, so I sorted everything out and began building my new decks.

I still have the elf deck I mentioned, but now my Rohan deck with Dunhere, Tactics Eowyn and Theoden is realized! Once Treason of Saruman arrives today I’ll be putting spirit Theoden in as there are more expensive spirit cards than there are tactics cards but this deck is ready to rock and roll! I took it through Passage Through Mirkwood a few times last night. Once solo and once with a friend as a refresher for him.

I also made a hobbit deck and I’ve learned a lot about how to play them in the sessions I played with it! This deck uses Sam, Merry and Pippen from Black Riders with a sub-theme of getting ally Treebeard out with some other Ents for a lot of wallop. It’s very fun!

Lastly, I had another friend ask if I could build a deck with his favorite character, Prince Imrahil. I tried to make a Gondor deck but it just didn’t work. Maybe it paired with a high questing deck it would be fine but I took it apart to make the Hobbit deck.

Trying to decide if I jump back into where I was quest-wise (khazad-dum) or if I jump into the sagas. Correct answer is probably “why not both?”

I have finished the Ring-maker cycle.  Next up Khazad Dum and Dwarrowdelf cycle.

ive played in a weird order, cause I’ve been catching up, and playing what I owned.  After Dwarrowdelf I have Grey havens to play.  Last will be the saga as I am still missing Mountain of Fire.  But it will take me some time yet to get there so I have time to find it

Finally completed the Angmar Awakened cycle by beating The Dread Realm straight solo and 2-handed (progression mode, standard difficulty).

After the masochism I went through to beat The Battle of Carn Dum, I was surprised by the relative ease of The Dread Realm, especially straight solo (won 6/14 games with my unmodified Faramir/Erestor/Glorfindel deck from Carn Dum, save for the addition of the Delay the Enemy side quest). 2-handed admittedly was more challenging, took me 6 attempts to score a victory. 

All in all, I enjoyed that one.

Although I could go on to The Grey Havens next, I'm thinking of taking a break from LotR LCG for a few months in order to try Arkham Horror LCG (which I have yet to try, even though I have everything up to the end of The Forgotten Age) or to give Mansions of Madness more table time... looking forward to more play not to mention getting more work done, rather than deck building.

With the final box I purchased finally in my collection (The Mountain of Fire) I went back to making the tweaks I wantedto make. In my Spirit/Lore Elf Deck, Gildor and a few other cards were removed for the ally sons of Elrond and more threat reduction. In the Hobbit/Ent Support deck (Hobbit heroes, ally Treebeard) Rosie Cotton and Quickbeam moved in and found their spots kept nice and warm. Lastly in my Spirit/Tactics Rohan deck, Theoden went from Tactics to Spirit and added Herugrim. Now we're ready.

In my first unconventional test run, I took the Elves on a Journey Down the Anduin. I wanted to see if they could handle that massive Hill Troll and see how all the new elements of the deck played together. This quest - the Hill Troll intimidates me but otherwise I find it a lot of fun and a good challenge. A perfect place to try out my new ideas.

Much to my surprise and satisfaction they absolutely crushed it! A Goblin Sniper came into the staging area early very early, but the Elves were ready. With very careful resource management, threat reduction and a lucky early healer draw, our heroes defeated the Hill Troll. Then came the fun. A second Goblin Sniper entered the staging area as we began phase 2. Even worse, the next two enemies were the wargs, the ones that go back to the staging area when there isn't a shadow effect on its shadow card. With a constant threat of 5  before draw the pressure was on! However the deck kept everything under control, reducing threat to under 20 and utilizing a timely arrival by Gandalf to kill a Goblin Sniper. When I got to stage 3 there were (only) 6 enemies in the staging area. One by one the foes went down and victory was claimed. I lost count of how many turns it took but my final threat was at 17!

Thanks for bearing with me in my excitement, I don't beat that quest solo very often!
