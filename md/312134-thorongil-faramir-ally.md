Hi !

If I play with "Messenger of the King" contract and I choose "Faramir" ally.

I want to use "Thorongil" to trade him for the Leadership hero "Faramir". 

Can I do it ?

You don't trade heroes with Thorongil.

Thorongil allows you to GAIN the ability and resource icon of hero you choose from your collection. So in this case the ally-turned-hero version will still be in play but will also have the ability of the Leadership Faramir hero you choosed with Thorongil.
