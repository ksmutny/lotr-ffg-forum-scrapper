I was thinking today that I would freaking love to see a cycle for this game based on stories from the Silmarillion.  If you've ever read it the stories inside are more like a mythology than they are an actual epic like Lord of the Rings.  I think it would be awesome to see these stories fleshed out with new scenarios and cards.  They could release them in First and Second Age expansion packs or maybe one big box expansion for the entire thing.  It's just a pipe dream on my part, but man it would be cool.

FFG license and how much freedom they have by the tolkien estate is something ive discussed at length on here, and the simple answer to if they will is we dont know for sure, but can make some assumptions

if you dont want to read a boring lengthy reply then ill just say this-

if they were then that would be awesome - as long as they made limits of how far they pushed the boundaries of tolkien lore. more of middle earth we see the better but...........

if you want to read this boring lengthy answer then here it is-

however it would raise issues of how exactly do you fit the current third age cards into the 1st age? now i know alot of people arent bothered, but on the flip side if you're going to start doing things like that then you may as well just scrap any and all tolkien lore and just be completely free with card releases, ie. releasing gil galad in an elf themed pack-  some games do this, but it is not this games style- it is very storyline and theme orientated which is good.

there is a similar problem with releasing 'dead' characters at the time of the cycles (though not as big a problem).-all this would go against their 'storyline' quests, and how they release thier products, so this only leaves the option of making these 2nd and 1st age expansions very large and self sustaining so that they dont need other cards already out. this would be a big waste of money if they did this and it would annoy alot of players that they were restricted on deck building, therefore i cant see that happening

bottom line=it isnt going to happen. if it is it wont for a long time. im pretty sure i read at the release of this game that they had a pretty restrictive license, and tolkien estate isnt known for letting thier companies just do anything- thank god or else middle earth would have been destroyed long ago by horrific-post-tolkien-fan-fiction

though that doesnt mean if tomorrow they released a news article stating they were working on a gondolin, last allience, numenor, rise of gondor/arnor etc .pack, i wouldnt be intrigued- im just looking forward to more third age stuff- more specifically the shire

Sorry to be a kill joy

I can definitely see what you're saying.  At the same time if players don't wish to use those cards, then they wouldn't have to if they wanted to stick strictly to the story.  If they didn't release this as an expansion to the card game I'd love to see a stand alone product at some point in time.  Gondolin, now that you mention it, would be particularly awesome.

yes, it could be possibly a stand along product- hopefully not a print on demand one- but a full quality one where the player cards can (if you chose so) be used in any other deck, depending on where you stand with thematic correctness

where did this concept start that the print of demand products are inferior to the "real" thing.. they are exactly the same.

i thought that it was accepted they were of lower quality than the standard cards?

from ffg site

Due to the difference in production, the Print on Demand cards will not 100% match all of the cards that exist in the Fantasy Flight catalog. Color shifts are bound to happen when printing materials on different printers. In addition, the high-quality Print on Demand cards are created using different methods, resulting in them not having the linen finish found on many Fantasy Flight Games cards.

fair enough it doesnt state lower, so i may be wrong on that, but isnt it genereally accepted they arent exactly the same?

ive seen plenty of people state like you their the same, but ive seen plenty of people state there is a noticable difference
