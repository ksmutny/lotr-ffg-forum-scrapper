This is a coop game. You can't get mad at them for adding cards that are made for coop...

All enemies from the Rhosgobel encounter deck can only be blocked and attacked by ranged characters or eagles. You'll have a hard time soloing that if you dont have tactics in the mix - or Dunedains Cache...

i disagree- its a 1-2 player game, therefore it isnt unreasonable to ask for cards that can be fullly used by 1 or 2 players ,but i now see the rhosgobel point, and im guessing it will come into use in other packs

It's fully useable with 2 players. You can't expect every single card to be great for everyone. The Songs are worthless for someone playing solely monosphere decks.

I would be disappointed if they did NOT include cards designed for coop play.

good point, this is my first CCG/LCG so i dont really know what track record FFG has for keeping solid, playable cards coming out as time progresses

 The Cache is also a Leadership card, and most leadership cards are designed to be more powerful with more players.

Good call on the Rhosgobel enemies that require ranged characters to attack or defend. I hadn't considered that. You guys always think of the cool stuff.

Ranged is my favorite keyword, Surge...not so much. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I know that there are quite a lot of people out there enjoying LotR as a solo game. But I still think it's kinda funny that everytime they preview a card that's more suited for coop gaming, some of the solo players start to complain.

The card pool has to grow for all kinds of player. As a player who plays only coop (at least most of the time) I'm looking forward for more cards that enable more complex player interaction!

Actually I was hoping for a card like "Dunedain cache"! And here it is...

dont get me wrong, im not complaining as such....im obsessed with this game, the problem for me is that i can only afford to commit financially to one game, and that one is LOTR. so giving that you dont get many new cards in adventure packs as it is, id like my £10 to be well spent, so if some cards are going to be useless then you can see my dissapointment.....that said i can see it from the co op players point of view, everyone needs a bit of love afterall, i just hope that FFG remember that this is both a 1 and 2 player game

Shouldn't you be more pissed about cards like Brand son of Bain [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_brand-son-of-bain-thoem.jpg] and Gildor's Counsel [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_gildors-counsel-thoem.jpg], which do things that are actually useless in solo play?

I hear ya. And we're in similar situations as far as focusing on just one game right now. Economy sucks.

Cache will have limited usefulness in solo, no doubt about it.

Wonder if Marshes will be released last week of October. The people I play with will be excited to see Boromir. Usually if we play 3-player, Tactics ends up sitting out but with Boromir people might start fighting over who gets to play Tactics.

There are going to be cards that do better solo, and cards that do better multiplayer.  With only 9 new player cards per pack, I can see how you could be disappointed with some of them being worthless or almost worthless in solo, but the game is designed to also support 2-4 players at a time, so it is reasonable that cards will be made with 2-4 players in mind; on the other hand, cards will and do come out that work better solo.  Leadership is slanted more towards group play than the other spheres, so it shouldn't be much surprise at this point if they continue to get cards that work better 2-4 players.  Also, I would bet on a Dunedain card in the next pack that gives a hero sentinel.

I now i day they will make the attachment bow or something to give heroes ranged. OK now we have Cache. But from now value of ranged heroes go down.

Now every hobbit can be ranged and can you Image Gimly with U.G and Cache kill every enemies in game. Sounds very powerful!!!

With every pack the make game more and more easy.........

There are many people that do. And one can even get shouted at for pointing out something like you did. I do agree though, this is a coop, also. I think almost every other card is more useful with a certain number of players, this is just a more extreme example. And I really like the Cache card.

On another point, maybe that is not everyone's cup of tea, but I for one enjoy playing two decks when alone. I like 2-player better, and I sometimes play solo, too; but this combined way is also enjoyable...to me.

I do not think Gimli with all the attachments in the world will help you beat Osgiliath. I find the balance between hard and playable pretty decent. Most people struggle in winning still. I enjoy winning but there are games when you just cannot do anything about it. I beat Osgiliath yesterday but I doubt I shall do it again any time soon unless I play it like crazy.

We already have the deck who is beat osgiliath easy  90% of time. If we Add cache for Gimly will be more easy to play cose sometimes ou can save some important characters of another player.

Better FFG start to make some really cool encounter cards.

Anyway we already decided with my friend start to play nightmare mode.Start from HFG to Carrock and Rhosgobel. According to FAQ 1.1 should be quite hard.

Ok i donth have a deck list with me but i can explain how its works. There is 2 decks.

1. is  Beravur, Eowyn, Eleanor. Purpose of this deck is Cancel revealed effect and draw card and support whit some cool atachments as well. Like : Burning Brand and so on. There is lot of allies in this deck: River song(very important to know shadow card of the first enemy) Nimrodel , Miner and so on.

This deck usually not engage the enemies and dont fight much.

 2. Second deck is Gimly, Theodred, Thalin. This is fighting deck. There is many eagles as well. Dunedian warning, marks and all this stuff include sneak attack and Gandalf of course. + feint , first strike and all cards for fighting. This deck take all enemies on him and kill them.

Steward included in this deck you play on Eowyn first deck never on this deck heroes. And anohter deck play song of wisdom on Thalin and after  B Brand on him to cancel all shadow effect.

The most problem is survive first 3 rounds. If you survive the heroes start to get attachments and events (By Beravur) they already strong enough to kill most of the enemies.  Now you need Ranger of Ithilien. In 2 player game you get it for sure. Dont rush to much and try to play as much allies as you can+ Faramir.Then you cross the river.

Now time for  Faramir job. First deck have a lot of allies and second deck have some too. On the last stage you dont care about Witch-King you just engage him play feint or some ally can die add 3 threat and next turn you quests with all allies + Faramir can be around 40-50 will power.

Finish you win.Is more easy then you can think sometimes.

I will post the decks list later.

Of course in solo game is not so easy but this 2 decks works perfect against any quest for now. That why we decide to play  nightmare from now.

 Yeah Richsabre, I can see where you're coming from as I am also a solo player primarily. I do have to agree with the majority on this chat that the game is designed for both 1 & 2 player and therefore cards will reflect both play styles.  I do wish we got more player cards quicker somehow.  As far as Cache, as much as it is rather useless for my solo deck, it could come in handy against JTR.

Thanks for your time, Glaurung. Looking forward to seeing the deck.

One question for now? You play A Burning Brand on Thalin? So you keep Thalin for defense?

Yes most of the times Thalin is for defense. But in other quests you can use him for quests. Gimly is a killer in Osgiliath!!!!!

First deck play All U.cuorage on Beravur for draw but with new Cache card you can play one U.courage on Gimly so he can control all table cose him Ranged.

And Boromir coming now!!!!! Players cards so powerful!!!!! Many combination to win and now win much more easy then in time of core set.

Ok Oagiliath is also not easy one but is only one for now!!!!!

richsabre:

What you're missing here is that by virtue of being a cooperative game, there must be cards that work in a cooperative manner.  There are certain combinations of really awesome actions that aren't possible with card X and card Y because you may not be playing both spheres necessary in the same deck.

Solo is fun, 2 player is solid.  Around the time you get to 3 and 4 player, those cards that you may find useless really shine.  After 4 adventure packs, the complexity of multiplayer deck interaction is improving.  If you don't want to play cooperatively, power to you, but they aren't going to stop making cards that need other cards that may not be in a solo deck in order to fully realize their power.

We see what you're saying, but you're writing off an entire aspect of the game.

 and frankly - it is the main aspect of this game... building an ALTRUISTIC DECK is now more advantageous than a solo-player deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

you don't only put in cards, which are good for you - you think about your mates and what they could need - what they play - you have to compliment their playstyle and deck! I often play steward of gondor on OTHER player's heroes, or celebrian's stone... or self preservation.... it doesn't always have to be me who is the strongest, baddest, best, etc.... the FELLOWSHIP aspect is more important

 

therefore, I like these multiplayer cards - like dunedain cache, brand, imrahil also shines in multiplayer, or gildor's counsel... invaluable in multiplayer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

un pour tous et tous pour un! (one for all and all for one!)

yes i see these things, but you must see that this is coming from someone who doesnt know anyone in their area and lives in the middle of nowhere (great for getting in the mood, not so much for finding mates gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]) and is purely a solo player- mates dont come into for me, and even if they did i have no wish to play this as a 2 player game, im all about the soloing, though i do acknowledge that most people play co-operative, so im not trying to write off the games as a co-op  i was just giving my 2 pence in the matter.

I know this has been answered but as a solo player, Dunadain's Cache will be REQUIRED to solo Journey to Rhosgobel without pulling one's hair out. At least that's my experience with it. I also would expect to see more reasons to use it in solo situations in coming APs and expansions.  The Cache is hardly for multiplayer only.

## 33 [ClydeCloggie on October 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54872-new-card-in-dead-marshes-useless-for-solo-players/?do=findComment&comment=544193)

 As a solo player, I do see use for the Cache even if it's only in Rhosgobel. Still, with my current habit of tackling all quests with a 50 card deck and 10 card sideboard, swapping up to 5 cards between quests, the Cache will go into the sideboard.

I would hope that the number of cards that can exclusively be used in multiplayer (Campfire Tales etc.) will be kept low, and that we will see cards that have their biggest effect in solo play.

So yesterday we have a long evening to play nightmare session with my friend Koby. We have 2 very good working together decks. Quest/draw/cancel effect deck Beravur/Eowyn/Eleanor  and fighting deck Gimly/Theodred/Thalin.

In this thread before i use to explain how those 2 decks very good work together against any quest even against Osgiliath so here is my report about how is work in Nightmare.

First,  big surprise for us nightmare with even new FAQ 1.1 rules is more easy and annoy then just solo game. Why???? Cose in this game you can control what kind of cards you have in your deck on the beginnig of every quest session. For example:  In the first game by Beravur we both take all our deck in hands. Than When you come to the last stage of the quest you heal all your wounds, reduce your threat and discard to discard pile all the cards(by Protector of Lorien) which you dont need in the next Quest (in our case next one is Carrock). So then when you finish the first quest you start second one with the best cards in  you draw deck. you can even discard all the cards keep only 7 and exactly manage your best starting hands!!! And Beravur deck get in starting hand dwarven tomb and Will of the west so you always can get your deck back from discard pike later for both players when you need it. So you can Choose your staring hand from quest to quest easy!!!!! This is amazing!!!! This advantage you can never get in normal game. So i dont tnink need to explain the encounter deck cannot do nothing against you. So you can manage your staring hand, You always have resources to pay for your cards(steward) you always have enough cards in both players hands so you can answer on any card in encounter deck and you always have advantage cose  encouner deck still reveal only 2 cards per turn.

Poor baby encounter deck!!!! I feel pity for him!!!! Ohh my god!!!! This is what  Nate French develop for this game?????Sorry but something wrong here.

I hope my english is good enough and every one undestand what i mean and you can always try this by yourself!!!! Cheers for every one.

In this regard I have to back up Glaurung: if you build a deck around card drawing it is not uncommon to have a very large portion if not all your deck in your hand after mid game. I have a Lore/Spirit deck with Beravor, Unexpected courage, Ancient Mathom and Ereborn Hammersmith to get those back. Even with only one Unexpected Courage on Beravor you draw roughly 6 cards in average per turn (including Ancient Mathom etc) even more if you have two Courages on her. Then you blast your way through the quests with Protector of Lorien. Its very efficient but not very entertaining.

In a nutshell: If you wanna draw your whole deck its pretty well doable with the current card pool

I run a spirit lore deck the routinely draws the entire deck when it functions.  beravor + UC pulls the entire deck in 9 turns.  Drawing that many cards will get you a minstrel or a second UE, which can further accelerate the pace. I'm hard pressed to see why anyone would doubt Glaurung's claim.

Well, this is simply not needed and sounds like an overkill. Beravor + multiple Courage is a nice combo, but does not break the game, it makes you win more and the victory is more overwhelming. Drawing 5 cards per turn does NOT win you the game.

The thing that counts is the victory and not "the style". If the deck focuses too much resources on card drawing, it may lose the game while the board is not stabilized yet. If the board is no more threatening to you, you may pull off a combo like "draw entire deck", but the point is, drawing entire deck did not help you at all, you already won the game before you started putting 2nd and 3rd courage on beravor. When the encounter deck is not capable of doing anything against you, it does not matter AT ALL if you draw 1, 3 or 100 cards per turn.

There is only one main reason to put courage on beravor that really helps the player. It is to make her useful in questing/attacking//defending (while still drawing 2 extra cards per turn).

So to summarize (if you have beravor + multiple UC) , drawing entire deck does not make you win the game. Instead, winning a game makes you draw entire deck. Do you feel the difference of implications?

Protector of Lorien would like a word with you.

Drawing most of your deck also helps with Will of the West, since you'll have only key cards (D. Tomb, Greeting) in the discard pile, rest are in your hand. So by shuffling say 3x Tomb, 3x Greeting, 2x WotW back into your deck, with Beravor drawing 8 cards, you'll be getting them ready to use in just one turn, no need to hope you draw them soon enough.

The box of the game says "cooperative game", so I think releasing cards for coop players is the only reasonable move. And what would a card look like that's for solo play only? Would it have a card text like: "You're not allowed to play this card when there's more then one player present." Or: "If another player is present, this ally get -10 willpower"?

I think we can all agree that there'll be cards that will be more useful to the solo players or more useful to the coop players. But as much as I respect you wanting all of the cards to work for your solo play, there are a lot of people out there who either play muliplayer or use two decks for soloing through the quests. And I think the game was designed towards cooperative play... and solo play seems rather like a nice addition! (And I'm really glad they gave us this option, because many of the more insightful posts on this forums come from dedicated solo players...)

Actually if we talking about Brand he is very good hero not only for coop game. He is ranged and there is some flying enemies already + his will power 2 quite cool for tactic hero and attact Defense , hit points + threat cost is quite good. In my opinion he is much better then Thalin for any solo tactic deck.

 I would have never guessed you of all people would come up with such a lame deck and strategy Glaurung. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Sounds really dull.

In all customizable card games the most successful decks are dull: they are trimmed to be efficient, exploit a card balance weakness and amplify this element by adding more and more cards that support the key element and remain efficient in cost/effect ratio. You also could build a storytelling deck or deck with a theme. But those will not necessarily win the game for you (still you can have a good time). It really depends on why you play that particular card game: experience of victory, experience of story or experience of having a casual game with nice art work in it.

QFT. Absolutely correct. If you're playing to win, you'll exploit every loophole in the rules (or bugs if you're into competitive video games). It's not about fun, it's about winning consistently.

Check out Sirlin's homepage to get an idea about the mind of a pro player:

www.sirlin.net/ptw [http://www.sirlin.net/ptw]

Even after over ten years it's still extremely relevant and explains quite well why pro players (like Glaurung) often make such a obnoxious impression to non-competitive or casual players.
