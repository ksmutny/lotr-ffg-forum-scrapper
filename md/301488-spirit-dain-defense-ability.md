The spirit Dain can discard up to 3 cards to boost is defence. Can you do this before AND after a shadow card for the attacker has been revealed?

For exemble to match the new boosted attack value of the attacker from the shadow card.

Thank you!

Yes, since it is an action. Make sure you trigger it during an available action window (the green sections in the rulebook round sequence).

Yes, you can boost his defence either before or after the shadow card effect trigger.

Spirit dain is one of the best defensive hero in the game.

Just to be clear that you can only discard a total of 3 cards for a +3 defensive bonus during the combat phase of a turn. You cannot discard 3 cards before a shadow card is dealt and then discard another 3 cards after a shadow card is dealt for a total of +6 defense in one combat phase.Â
