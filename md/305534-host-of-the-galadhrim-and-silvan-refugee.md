Hi all. 

If I play HotG while Silvan Refugee(s) is/are in play, do I get to put them in my hand, or must they be discarded?

I want the fact that all the allies are returned at once to allow me to keep them, but I'm not sure if there's something I'm missing. 

Opinions or clarifications?

Thanks in advance!

The question should be Why Play Silvan refugee in a silvan deck in the first place?

Your initial feeling is correct: the allies are returned simultaneously, so by the time you'd be able to trigger the Refugee's "after" Forced effect, its text is no longer active (and moreover, it would say to discard her "from play" anyway).

[I often play Refugee in my Silvan builds myself—I am aware of the disadvantages.]
