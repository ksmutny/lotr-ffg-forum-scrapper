Hi guys,

My scenario:

Before The Great Bridge is explored The Balrog already has 25 damage points on him, in this case I don't need to sacrifice heroes in order to damage him but I'm not sure if The Balrog loses all the keywords if no hero is discarded.

Thanks

FAQ Page 5 (1.15): The word "then"

If a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve.

So yes, you'd still need to discard a hero.

You could use a zero threat hero like a unique ally with Sword-thain or Thalion with enough side quests cleared.
