So I'm working on stealing some treasure from Smaug and was wondering how this works exactly. Smaug says that he is considered engaged to the first player, but cannot leave the staging area. My question then is: does his threat count when I'm questing? And also, does he count towards Faramir's attack bonus?

Is he in the staging area ? so then his threat counts, and he gives bonus to Faramir.

It's that simple.

"Considered engaged" means he didn't truelly engage and so didn't leave the staging area.

Oh okay. I was just confused because engaged enemies do not count threat, but enemies in the staging area do. I guess the "considered" part makes sense. Thanks!
