Alright the book has the phases and order of play in chart form that tells you windows to play actions in.  Playing event cards from hand with no specific timing listed counts as an action correct?

Now in the rules it states that a player can play effects/actions after any step in a phase, which does not seem to match the play chart in the back of the book as it doesn't have green spaces between each listed step.  Which is correct?  Purely following the chart where you can only play these cards duing the green bars that say actions can be played, or is it like it said earlier in the rules that between any step?

are you referring to the green box text ? "Any player can take actions generally, or
between the game steps stated in the rules.   "

 

player actions can be played anytime in the green steps or between each phase- i think thats what game steps mean, though i could be wrong, stick to the chart and you're ok

The chart is misleading in that it doesn't indicate that you can take actions between combat steps; e.g., between executing a shadow card and assigning damage.  You *can* do this, despite what the chart suggests.
