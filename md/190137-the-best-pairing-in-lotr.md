Let's discuss. I think the best one is Tauriel/Kili because it's basically the only lesbian pairing Tolkien invented.

As Sam Beckett once said, "Oh boy."

Don't feed the trolls...

 

Unless you really have to.  And then you should use a cheap ally.

ha.

how about we do not have a second round of discussing this and it turning into a weird argument about feminism where people lose control and get abusive/nasty. 

Tauriel is a completely made up Jackson character that is not canon. Purely in the movies and not at all in anything Tolkien ever wrote or created. To any real fans of tolkiens work she is a complete joke and offensive to the rest of the material. Don't really get what your whole lesbian statement is about....?

 

Obvious troll is obvious and this is not a discussion people should have again as it will only lead to the moderators stepping in and locking the thread (as they should!).

Yeah... I'm not replying to this thread.

 

Oh, wait.

So Kili was a woman? Who knew?

I've got popcorn with hot sauce and a comfy seat. This bear is ready for a show...

I think this stuff have already exhausted itself to put up any kind of show.

Well, my vote goes to Faramir/Eowyn for what it's worth...

edit: Wouldn't Elboron have been both Third Marshal of the Riddermark (under both Eomer's and Ælfwine's rule) and the Steward of Gondor? That's a lot of power to hold.

Me and my wife I would say  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

What, we are not in the Lord of the Rings ? Well, neither Tauriel and Kili are  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Now I can never see Snowborn Scout without inserting book purist lines at his cry ever again! Thanks Ecthalion! Troll-bait-Snowborn-Scout should be a meme!

I really like Tauriel. I would have preferred if she had just been awesome without needing to be someone's love interest but it's alright I guess.

She's certainly not an insult to anyone with self esteem. I mean legolas sky walking while a tower falls should register higher if you're a 'real fan'.

The thread will get locked when invariably an abusive dork begins to get creepy and aggressive. There's nothing wrong at this point.

Russian quickscoper gets edgy.
