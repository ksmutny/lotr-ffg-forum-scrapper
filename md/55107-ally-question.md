How many "Ally" cards can you have in play at a time?Â  1 per Hero or as many as you can afford?

As many as you can afford

some quests - i.e. escape from Dol Guldur restrict how many you can play in a round

some locations - i.e. Old Ford have a threat equal to the number of allies in play.

But otherwise, as many as you like
