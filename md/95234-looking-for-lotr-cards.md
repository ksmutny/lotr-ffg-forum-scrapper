Depending on where you live. In the US you could try directly from FFG , if in Europe, maybe amazon.co.uk cause of lower P&P than ordering from FFG

Amazon seems to have most of te cards for sale a lot of times, and for decent prices. There are also plenty of gaming site selling the cards, which you can find easily by Googling "buy Lord of the Rings LCG".

Also, you could try at bookdepository.com - or - bookdepository.co.uk. 
Just type in search box what do you need.

This site is the most affordable place I have found in the United States for Lord of the Rings: LCG cards.
