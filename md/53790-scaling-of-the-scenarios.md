So here is some of my conclusion about difficulty level of the quests in 1 player game to 2 players game.

Journey down to Anduin: 1 player and 2 players game diffiuclt level is same. there is no really big difference.

Hunt for Gollum: With 2 player game is more diffucult cose is start to be really boring and you will still win only take more time.

Carrock: Here is another story. In the 1 player game quest is quite easy but in 2 players game is start to be really difficult and much more dangerous.The best example for  now how is should be.

Rhosgobel: Difficult to say cose this quest need really specific deck building then other scenarios. 

Osgiliath: Really brutal in  solo  game and much more easy in 2 players game.Actually is strange but is true.

So what do you think fellows???

I disagree about Anduin, I believe its much easier co-op

HFG is also easier co-op, but still fairly easy in solo play

I've not played Osgiliath yet solo or multi player and only played JtR solo, but my assessment is that the others are all harder solo than duo.  My win % is significantly lower solo than 2 player.  With 2 player, one of us usually has the answer to the problem the encounter deck throws at us.

It all depends on what decks are used. My experience is as follows:

- Journey - very easy or very hard solo, depending on the deck. Medium difficulty in multi

- Carrock - easy solo, harder multi (because its easier to accidently flip to stage 2 as the progress management is more tricky)

- Hunt - very easy solo for almost every deck, rather hard for multi (norther trackers are very helpful)

- Rhosgobel - I played it quite a lot solo and it is very hard unless you have a lot of healing in the deck. Can't say for multi because played only 2-3 games

- Osgilath - medium - high difficulty solo, high multi. It's easier to control threat in solo play

My experiences so far are:

Passage Through Mirkwood: Easy with multiple players. For solo, Spirit is very easy, but average difficulty with the other spheres. 

Journey Down the Anduin: Moderate diffiulty solo but easy with 3-4 players.

Escape from Dol Guldor: Have only played solo and it is impossible as far as I am concerned. 

Hunt for Gollum: Have never completed this in 2 player. The game has always beaten us. Played it once solo and beat it very easy.

Conflict at the Carrock: Only played solo and have so far failed to complete it. It's very tough.

Rhosgobel: Only played solo and beat it on first attempt with Lore deck, but I think I was very lucky with what was drawn from the encounter deck.

Osgilliath: Waiting for mine to arrive. I'm guessing this is going to be an impossible quest in solo.

 Good review The_Big_Show. I have experienced similar results, except for Anduin.

I'm pretty much on the same page with you here.  I have completed HfG fairly easy in 2-player co-op.  I just did a 3-player Dol Guldor yesterday and we beat it on our first attempt, but it was very difficult and we ended with a horrible score.  I see Dol Guldor being impossible at this point solo.  I finally attempted Carrock last night, I gave it 2 attempts with a deck I've had great success with in Mirkwood and HfG and wound up failing twice.  Its difficult because as soon as you progress to that second quest you get swamped with threat and all it takes is a Brown Lands or River Nangloor (or both in my case) to really crush you.

I haven't tried Rhosgobel yet, I'm waiting to beat Carrock first before I move on.

 I agree that Dol Guldor is utterly impossible solo.  Ive played it maybe 5 times solo and farthest I have been is freeing the prisoner, only to die next round. CATC I got lucky with two gandalfs, two galadhrims greetings and +5 willpower on eowyn.  Have failed twice against rhosgobel, and might be changing my deck to add in more healing, though I would prefer not to, seeing as it's worked on every other quest so far except guldor.

It's definitely not easy, that's for sure

Dol Guldur solo win:

## 13 [Glaurung on September 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53790-scaling-of-the-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=534255)

I donth have much experinece with 3 or more players. We play 3 players once and this is not interesting at all. Too easy and boring. Even we reveal 4 cards instead 3 still win easy, yawing and look tv show at the same time. So for now we not really interesting play 3 or more player game.

2 players game start to be more hard and interesting since Carrock come out.

Carrock will not forgive you for mistake as other quest do. If Luis engage you with other trolls can start prepare your coffins.

Of course is depend on the decks as well. All my experience base on 50 cards expert deck 3 copies each card. Sure if you have only 1 core set the game much more harder. But me and my friends buy at least 2 core set each + some singles like U. courage stone, Dwarfen tomb and so  on to get all cards 3 copies.

We are serious prepare for the tournaments and my goal is win Word cup in the future.

Actullay i want say some thanks and respect for some cool players like Bohemond, Pumkins, Radiscul, LightDarker, Dam. I always respect a players who is play deep and think well. So if you have good opponent game also much more interesting.

 

Engilsh is not my home lenguage so maybe for someone i can be ridiculous.

Actually i think you nick name is also quite ridiculous  Durin3. Just joking......

I'm sure you'll hoist the trophy high. I look forward to reading the tourney reports. (I really shouldn't use sarcasm, it won't translate well at all.)

Glaurung: it's not the way you type that I think is ridiculous (I commend you for your messages as I realize English is not your primary tongue), it's your general haughtiness and your overall condescending tone in a lot of your posts.  I realize you think the game is way too easy for you (and your friends?), but seriously man, most of us don't.  I am an avid Tolkien fan like yourself (as I would assume most of the people playing this game are), but that is no reason to chide others for not being as successful as you at winning this game when you have admitted that you have at least 3 of every card...it would seem based on this message board that the majority of players own 1 core set (an obvious disadvantage); and, these players seem to be having a blast.  Personally, I would rather talk about our mutual love for Tolkien than get into little squabbles like this, but man, c'mon, seriously, do you have to continue saying the game is too easy all the time?  You are the minority for sure; or, should I just assume you are having a blast annoying me and others? If that is the case, really? Congrats on your awesome win ratio!

Big Show and all,

If you would like some advice for solo in CatC, a lot of it depends on controlling the pace of advancement of the 1st stage.  Balance keeping your threat down while not progressing too fast.  Think of it as scouting out the area.  The lore cards that can negate threat in the staging area after the fact are good for this, the Lore encounter scouts (Denethor and Something Riversong) are great, the Lore mapmaker who can add will with resources, Eowyn with her ability to add 1, Faramir with his addition effect are all helpful.  I'm sure I'm missing some, but you get the idea - options to increase your will to bump it to match the threat without going over once you see the threat or the ability to find out what you are up against.

Meanwhile, build up assets - allies & attachments in play and events in hand.  If you can, build up resources for Grimbeorn - even if they are not leadership, you may get the loc that allows you to use any resource as leadership.  Grimbeorn joining the team is pretty helpful!

If you can, get your threat to under 34 when you have a decent build up and push to stage 2.  Bring down the trolls one at a time and they are not too bad.  A lot of times my threat is too high but I have the allies and events to deal with all of them and do fine.  For Gondor turns a pack of heroes and allies into troll slayers.  The leadership card that readies everyone is a great combo with this.  Kill  a troll or two for Gondor, ready everyone and kill another since On Gondor is still there!  Also keep some questing power handy to try to get rid of the Carrock as soon as possible after it goes active as getting rid of the +1 AT/+1 Def to the trolls is helpful. 

Remember you can heal Grimbeorn with Lore of Imrahilis if you play it.  I love it when he takes on two or three trolls and then I heal him. 

Since folks are getting a little edgy, I'm not claiming to be an expert!  Most of these suggestions are probably pretty fundamental, but maybe they will help out someone.  The principle of pacing really applies in many of the quests.  The pacing to do well in CatC is very different than JtR - which really does feel like a frenzied search for a remedy for a dying companion in my mind.

I actually find Hunt for Gollum the easiest to solo of what's been released so far.  Passage Through Mirkwood would be the second easiest to solo.  I haven't even tried soloing CatC or higher. 

As far as Glaurung, I don't like you.  You're arrogant and hard to take seriously when most of what you say sounds simply exaggerated.

You every right to like or dislike anyone you want, but for the sake of this community, let's all keep our opinions of each other to ourselves, please?

I personally have found Hunt for Gollum harder than all you guys, apparently. I know, I'm not a good deckbuilder (heck, I've known that since M:tG revised), but still my experiences have been best with Rhosgobel, then Gollum, then Carrock - solo that is. Anduin I haven't played in ages, Mirkwood likewise. I really should try the core quests again, soon-ish :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Unfortunately this board software makes it difficult to ignore people whose opinion you don't care about at all by not having an 'ignore' feature.

HFG is most easy for me. But Rhosgobel (i just get it) big problem. You must to build some specific deck to win this one. As i understand you must add some healing cards like Lore of Ilmadris to beat this one. But in other scenario most of the time they will be dead cards in your deck. So for me now the biggest problem how to make deck ti beat all scenario. Before Rhosgobel my beat all deck work very fine but now.......... I start to make new Glorifindel/Eleanor/ Theodred deck. Still in process.
