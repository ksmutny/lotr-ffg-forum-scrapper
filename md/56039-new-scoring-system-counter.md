# [New scoring system. Counter](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56039-new-scoring-system-counter/)

As we have new scoring system, maybe FFG will create and add to some expansion new counter/tracker like Threat Tracker to count the current quest round? Because it is a bit uncomfortably to mark number of rounds on some peace of paper. In my case it looks like "/ / / /.../ / "(like counting days in prisons or desert islands in many films happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]).

How do you think is it a good idea?

I've been using the small glass gaming tokens I've bought for other games. I have recently been using a D20, too, although any nudge on that D20 and you're bound to lose count :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes, it is a good variant to use some tokens, e.g. damage. If play solo I use the second threat tracker - very comfortable, they lay together and I don't forget to raise both of them, but I play solo very rarely. Most I play 2 player's game and I always forget to and one new round to count.

Actually i thing is really uncomfortable to keep you scores with any additional tool. Cose we already have a lot of tokens and threat tracker. So one more tool can be to much. This make game more hard in annoy way. No one really need it.

But the same time they definitely need to change score system cose is doesn work properly. And the same time they changes  limited by  already created tournament system.  So i think we need to wait until we see how tournament system work. Than we can say what is it really.

I use damage tokens to keep track of played rounds, works quite well.

Take a Post-It : count threat level of each player on it and the number of round. Each round, +1 to all of these.

LOTR LCG is a cooperative game.  It really is not appropriate for tournament play.  That's why everyone is having difficulty with establishing a practical tournament scoring system.

Yes, if there were no Hill Trolls, Marsh Added, Ungoliant's Spawns as shadow, different doomed etc.

Yesterday I played Rhosgobel and forgot to count rounds. And at the end of game it was simple to subtract number of result threat level and start threat level, and it was number of rounds. But when I played Journey down the Anduin, at the end of game it was hard to remember how many times and who was hit by Troll, Marsh Added etc.
