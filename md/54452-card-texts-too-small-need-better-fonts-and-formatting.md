FFG, please make the texts a little easier to read by making them a little bigger (bigger fonts?).  Not all of us have good eyesights for small texts.

In the Core Set's Eastern Crows card, the very important "Surge" word is very small, despite the abundance of empty space on the card.

I'd like to savor the flavor of the game by reading the flavor texts.  But the flavor texts are too small that I just skip reading them all together.

The player's event cards have their cards' titles on the left side (unlike the ally and attachment card that have their titles in the middle and on top of the cards, respectively).  However, the event cards titles are placed in such a way that you have to turn the card horizontally/sideways to read them.  Maybe if the title words read vertically from top to bottom (without need to turn card sideways), they would serve the purpose (of why the event card titles have to be on the left side) better.  Or maybe, just place the event card title either on top or middle.  I know it's a small matter but these small matters have to be paid attention to when designing/engineering products.

To avoid overly wordy texts, LotR Card game should have standard phrases that would automatically be clear to the player, without need for clarificatory texts.  Do we really need the word "Action" on event cards?  We only need the word when it specifies what phase you can play the card (eg. "Quest Action").  But other than that, I think it's automatic that event cards are actions.

So, here's a vote for better card layout.
