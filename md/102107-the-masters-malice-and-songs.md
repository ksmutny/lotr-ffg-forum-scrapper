Simple question: can songs (battle, kings, wisdom and travel) save a hero from the damage of The Master's Malice (HoN 60) ? Or is 'gaining a ressource icon' not the same as 'belonging to a sphere of influence' ?

 

For example, let's say I have a spirit hero with a song of battle attached to him. When I choose tactics for the 'The Master's Malice' effect does that spirit hero takes 3 damage or not ?

Gaining a ressource icon is the same as belonging to a sphere.

From rulebook :

>  
> 
>  
> 
> 9. Resource Icons: Found only on hero cards, these
> icons indicate the sphere(s) of influence to which
> resource tokens in this hero’s resource pool belong.
> They also indicate to which sphere(s) the hero card
> itself belongs

This actually a very good question.

As you can see in the last sentence above me, the "printed" resource icon identifies which sphere of influence a "hero belongs to".

 

"Sphere of Influence Icon: Indicates which sphere

this card belongs to. The card’s template color also
indicates this. Neutral cards have a grey template and
no sphere of influence icon."
 
Reference from the Rules of Play.

You have added the word "printed" yourself -- it doesn't appear in the passage you have quoted.  Shouldn't do that, as the word "printed" is used in a very specific way when it appears in the rules.

 

Alogos is correct, this was clarified by Caleb awhile back:

 

"That's a good question. Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.

Cheers,

Caleb"

 

And that's in this thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/84466-sphere-match/?hl=%2Bgood+%2Bmeal].

Thanks for the answer.

Playing songs is a really good way to handle this treachery in a multisphere deck, although the allies will still take a beating.

The Master´s Malice affects neutral allies too?

neutral is a lack of sphere and not a sphere in itself... so, yes.
