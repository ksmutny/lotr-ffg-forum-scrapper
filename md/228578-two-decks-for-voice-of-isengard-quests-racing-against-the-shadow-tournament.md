Hello guys,

I need an advice for the next seventh "Racing Against the Shadow Tournament" we'll play soon in Italy.

In Italy we are a great community of players and we organize a lot of events :-)

For this Tournament, each team of 2 players must face the three quests of The Voice of Isengard deluxe expansion, The Fords of Isen, To Catch an Orc and Into Fangorn.

The question is, what kind of "fellowship decks" (2 players) is the best choice for these 3 quests?

(Each players has also a side deck of 15 cards to change the deck for each deck)

Thank you very much for your help!

Do you reset threat, damage, and resources between quests? I knew guys who didn't.Â

Yes, we reset all between each quest

I have a Fellowship of 2 decks on ringsdb called The Victory of the Dunedain that works extremely well against these quests.

I may have tweaked them somewhat since then and they're also designed for a single Core Set.
