Saw on the Arkham Horror forums that the Gen-Con event had been posted and decided to go looking to see if the LOTR one had as well.  It has!!  Looks like they are continuing along with the idea of different competitive modes.

Hmmm. I thought this was a co-op game, or solo. Am I missing something?

The "On Competitive Play" section of last year's Gencon quest announcement should help explain things. (tl;dr: In addition to standard solo/co-op, the scenario allowed for a form of competitive play.)

Presumably this year's event will be similar.

I'm curious why they're pushing this angle? Hoping to pick up competitive LCG players? Based on what I've seen online it seems like many/most existing players play solo, and will have no use for these kits.

I wonder if this new angle is respinsible for the new erratas...?

While these scenarios are designed for competitive play, there are also rules that allow cooperative or solo play. Instead of customizing the encounter deck for the other team and hoping to hit them unprepared, you can just pick seven random encounter sets and play these quests like any other. Of course with the modular deck, you have many different combinations, some of them are more deadly than others.

Yes, but based on what I've heard the scenarios are not very satisfying when played in this way, because of the many effects where the other player/team is supposed to choose for you.

It's annoying and subjective to choose for yourself.  You can do it more randomly (but less threateningly) by just discarding until you meet the criteria.  (For those that specify a certain point value, try to find the matching point value first instead of taking a "or less").

But what you essentially end up is a random quest with a fairly generic plotline.  That can be hard to compete with the hundred other quests out there, especially when you haven't played them all yet, but it also enjoys more variability in the encounter cards than you'll see practically anywhere else out there.  I think some will find that interesting, especially in a deck testing environment as an alternative to playing Passage through Mirkwood (to test viability) or Journey Down the Anduin (to test strength) for the upteenth time.  I certainly enjoy randomly generated dungeons in dungeon crawling games.

If/when the game ever does end, I think these scenarios combined will make a nice toolkit for community-invented quests.

One advantage of this over the usual Fellowship quests -- it's *way* easier to win!

The best way to use these kits is to customize your own dream scenario, whether you use it in a cooperative or competitive setting.

Well, I do not have a problem picking the worst possible card from the encounter deck. As I like playing against myself in other games, this is not too different. Though I admit, it can be difficult for others.

Yeah I really don’t care about the competitive part.  But custom scenarios, WOW! Yes please, give it to me now!!!!

When will the scouring of the Shire scenario come out?

I went to my FLGS Fellowship event last year and there was only one other person. We played co-op through the scenario with a random set of encounter cards (all the odd numbered ones I believe) and had a blast. It was a lot of fun.

If I have to go to GenCon and strain through one "competitive" session to get these cards and have them for future use I will gladly do so. A random setup is good fun. Speaking of which, when are the Wizard's Quest/Woodland Realm sets going to be available? I got the latter from the Fellowship Event but pre-ordered Wizard's Quest. I'm starting to wonder if that's ever coming out.

@TheSpitfired [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240687-thespitfired/] When I went to Gen Con for last year’s event (Wizard’s Quest), FFG actually ran it in cooperative mode; so might not have to “strain through a competitive game. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Awesome, I hope my FLGS has it for me soon!

I'm signing up for it either way! Watch us pair up and not even realize it.

That's why I adore CotR's little name tags at their listener events!

I think "The Mines of Moria" is the actual event's name, and that "Escape from Khazad-dûm" is the actual name of the scenario, reading that description.

And the official FFG announcement:

Guess it really is The Mines of Moria.

I've been away from the game for a while, but I'm going to play at GenCon.  This scenario screams dwarf deck, but with all the development since Isenguard are dwarf decks still viable?

Background:  I used to play super Boromir solo, but I'm teaching someone new to play for this event.  I've seen the nerf to Super Boromir and I don't feel like I'd need that deck anyways for non-solo play.  I remember when dwarves were the best trait in the game, but if they've not kept up with other trait developments than I will explore other builds.

I haven't played a dwarf deck for several years, so take my impression with a grain of salt.  I think it is less a matter that dwarves haven't kept up and more that back during the earlier cycles dwarves were one of the few defined archetypes that were powerful.  Since then Outlands, Dunedain, Noldor, Silvan, Dale, Rohan, Gondor and Hobbits have all become strong deck types and have caught up with strong dwarf decks.

TL;DR Dwarves are still good, but now other deck types are equally strong.

Dwarf swarm is still unarguably a top-tier archetype.
