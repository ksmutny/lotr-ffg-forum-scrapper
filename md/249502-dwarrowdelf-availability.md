I'm returning to the game after several years break and want to start on the Dwarrowdelf cycle, having previously played the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle last time time played. But Dwarrowdelf isn't available to buy anywhere. It's quite frustrating. I see on the FFG upcoming page it's "at the printer". Does anyone know how long it's been there and when to expect it in stores? (I'm in the UK).

I'm from Europe and usually buy from:

 

- bookdepository [https://www.bookdepository.com/] - but at the moment they have none of the Dwarrowdelf  cycle packs available;

or

- GamerzNexus [http://gamerznexus.imp-pos.com/index.php] - but from a quick search they only have the 4th pack (The Long Dark [http://gamerznexus.imp-pos.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=46871&search=Lord+of+the+Rings&description=true&limit=100]) in stock.

 

Here is the link [http://gamerznexus.imp-pos.com/index.php?route=product/search&search=Lord+of+the+Rings&description=true&filter_instock=true&limit=100] for what GamerzNexus has on LotR LCG - keep in mind that the search was with "Lord of the Rings" keywords so some of listed products aren't from LotR LCG but other games related to Lord of the Rings.

Although there is one that seems to have a wrong product description - it is clearly an Android Netrunner product...

 

Those are my main sites in US.

 

Have one in Portugal (where i'm from) but they don't have them in stock despite advertising that they deliver in 1 to 2 weeks...

Thanks, I think I'll just wait for the re-print to arrive. I was more curious as to how long it's been "at the printer" and when to expect them on the shelves again.

Most things take 3-4 months from when they're first tagged "At the Printer" until they hit stores.  I think it depends on the product.

They're actually listed as On the Boat now, as of 4/11.  I'd expect to see them sometime in June, which is good because I just bought the core box and am totally interested in getting some new cards/expansions.

I think you're looking at the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Dwarrowdelf are still "At printer".

 

-edit-

Although last update on Dwarrowdelf was in February, so hopefully they aren't far behind Shadows of Mirkwood...

Yeah.  You're right.  In any case, I've been semi tracking their release cycle and it seems like 6-8 weeks at the printer and then 4-6 weeks on the boat.  Shipping then takes about a week or two.  I'm guessing mid to late summer before we get restocked on Dwarrowdelf stuff.

FFG refreshed the status today- SoM is Shipping and Dwarrowdelf is On the Boat.

MagicMadhouse(dot)co(dot)uk have Dwarrowdelf cycle packs 2 and 4. If you're prepared to pay extra for postage, it looks as though CoolstuffInc also have a few packs as well as the Khazad Dum Deluxe box. Generally speaking it does look as if Khazad Dum should be available in the next 2 months or so - I would keep my eyes open and snap them up when they come.
