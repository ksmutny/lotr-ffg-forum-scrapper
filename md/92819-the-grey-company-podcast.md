That's great news, I am really excited about having a new podcast. Being able to listen to it on the go will definitely make my day :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Thanks for the effort & time you guys put into entertaining all the fans of the lotr lcg!!

I have only recently started playing this game (in the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, playing chronologically) and I have been enjoying the old Cardboard of the Rings episodes. Like any fresh obsession I find my hunger for new content about it insatiable. Will definitely check this out when it is up on iTunes or a handy RSS feed appears. I have regularly been visiting the blogs involved, so this should be fantastic. Good luck!

Hey Guys

 

Thank you very much for your effort to make this available on iTunes, too. I listened to the podcast yesterday....and I loved it! :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png] It's actually perfect: Focused and interesting and very informative!

I don't know if it's just me, but as a non-native English speaker, I had hard time listening to Dan's voice. Too quiet compared to the others.

## 12 [danpoage on November 4, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92819-the-grey-company-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=902273)

Thanks for the feedback, klaymen_sk. We are looking into fixing this! I may just need to get a new headset.

Enjoyable episode. Keep up the good work guys. Still think it's quite cool that all of the ancillary blogs teamed up for a podcast. Feels like the avengers or something

Howdy Scroll Lock, we've thrown around a couple of ideas for episodes, but we are absolutely open to ideas and suggestions. This Podcast is for the community, so your input and opinions are invaluable!

Great podcast, I'm loving it so far. My thoughts on Outlands is that it's a great tool for teaching the game to new players but that's about it. I really don't think the designers will base future playtesting on the outlands level of power. The Black Riders was designed after Outlands and it's easily smashed with Outlands so I don't see any Outlands effect there.

 

Quick question:  What is the music you play during your intro. It sounds great and I'd like to hear the full song. Thanks!

## 22 [danpoage on November 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92819-the-grey-company-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=911320)

The music in the intro is "All Your Light (Times Like These)" by Portugal. The Man.

 

Glad to hear that you are enjoying the podcast.

In this episode, we have a lively discussion of the various strategies we used for defeating this scenario. We include an in-depth look at many of the encounter cards, as well as insight into the decks that we designed to help us save Faramir from Minas Morgul.

 

For those who have not yet purchased this scenario, be warned, there are SPOILERS.

 

Enjoy!

Great Podcast guys!

 

I really enjoyed this Morgul Vale Episode. As a veteran player, it was great to hear all of your strategies and deck ideas as it gave me some new inspiration for decks. I'm very impressed with the wealth of knowledge that you've gathered together for your podcast.

 

Keep up the good work!

Thanks for the spoilers, misters!

 

Now that we've been waiting for news about LOTR: LCG content for 4 weeks (this'll be the fifth one), it's nice to have a daily test of new cards!

 

Have you played any of the Season 2 or 3 NM scenarios? If so, what's your take on them?

I've played Passage Through Mirkwood, Journey Along the Anduin, The Hunt for Gollum, and the Journey to Rhosgobel (I can't remember if I've tried any others).

 

I really, really like all of them. In many cases, they are much more thematic than the previous versions, and, of course, much more difficult.

 

Perhaps we can talk about them on the show at some point - but I really enjoy them. Plus, the art is so "nightmare-y," it's great! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I also played the Core Set Nightmare Version ones, and I feel the same: they feel more thematic (Dol Guldur the most) and harder. So I am very excited to know that the others are on the same level. A lot of curiosity with Hunt for Gollum, it seems like they put a new level of detail (player clues vs enemy clues race against the clock). At least that's what I saw on the preview in CoTR.

 

Talking about NM scenarios and how they have changed (and the new strategies needed to adapt) on your podcast sounds like a great idea too!

hunt for gollum-nightmare is more fun, but not all that difficult. i've never had an enemy "get" a clue every time i've played it. great concept, not the best in execution.

good episode, i thought you guys had a very fair analysis of the gondor trait and enjoyed the reasonings and discussion.  i also appreciate...correct me if i'm wrong, but is it matt who says he's the numbers guy and tallied up the number of cards? that was a nice little stats piece

In an upcoming episode of The Grey Company podcast, we'd like to discuss deck-building - using one of our listener's own decks! Struggling with building decks for the first time? Or, perhaps your a more experienced player looking for a bit of advice on a deck you've built? Fear not! Send us a deck list (or feel free to link us to a deck you've posted elsewhere) and your deck could be the next topic of discussion by The Grey Company!

Yes! Yes! Yes!

When you made 3rd episode, someone spoiled The Morgul Vale cards here in the forums at the same day.

So I am looking forward to VoI spoilers (right after listening to this episode), haha.

Great show! Keep up the good work.

As always: Great work guys, loved the new episode! Plus the timing is awesome, right in this drought while waiting for news on VoI or the Ring-Maker Cycle. I am really looking forward to the next episode on deck-building, too :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Or is there a chance that it will be a VoI special should the box come out in time? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Thanks! The drought feels interminable. While I anticipate that we will go ahead with Deck Building Part 2 no matter what, I can't predict what might happen when we actually get copies of Voice of Isengard in our hands!

I think you guys are doing a fantastic job with the podcast. I always look forward to the new ones.

## 58 [danpoage on January 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92819-the-grey-company-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=969546)

Thanks everyone, we appreciate the support and kind words.

If anyone has a deck that you would like us to discuss and improve on the next episode of the podcast, there is still time to submit it. Feel free to post or link it here, on the blog, or our Facebook page. Since it looks like we have to wait just a little bit long for the Voice of Isengard, we'll probably have to save the discussion of the new cards for the episode after next.

good episode as always.  I liked the analysis of each hero within the sphere and how it contributes (or doesnt contribute) to the theme or role that the sphere tries to maintain

Good discussion in the podcast.  I've started to listen to a couple of episodes, but I can never listen to the whole thing through because of the sound of Dan's voice.  There is some crazy nasty sibilance there (sharp "S" sounds).  I would recommend he either get a better microphone, or experiment with pointing his mouth away from the microphone's sweet spot.  Recording off-axis (mic pointed at an angle away from the mouth) would probably help that a lot.  But long-term, a better microphone that has a warmer sound would be ideal.

The Grey Company continues to put out new content, but we're looking for a little community support! On our latest episode [http://greycompanypodcast.wordpress.com/2014/11/05/17-rohan/] we announced that we've started a Patreon for those who are willing and able to donate to help cover the costs associated with producing a podcast. To go with that, everyone who becomes a patron (at any amount) will be entered into a drawing for a copy of the alternate art Aragorn card. 

 

Check it out and thanks to all of you for a great year of podcasting!

Yea, hosting and decent recording equipment can be expensive. I am lucky enough that my blog has more than enough traffic to pay for itself with Google Adsense. It's possible that the Hall of Beorn card search site could earn enough through well-placed ads, but I don't really know his traffic numbers and the way the site is used could potentially limit ad revenue. Also, nobody wants to see ads, so some users might get upset about it, but assuming the ads aren't obtrusive, I prefer them over paid services.

BTW Dan, before Matthew cut you off, I was really interested in seeing your Silvan Secrecy decks, will you share?

## 68 [WWPDSteven on November 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92819-the-grey-company-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=1324577)

Hey I came here to post the same thing as Narsil! Share the secret!

## 69 [danpoage on November 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92819-the-grey-company-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=1324646)

I will be posting these decks on the Hall of Beorn soon, so I don't want to ruin the surprise. In the mean time, I will spoil the heroes in each deck, to give you guys something to think about :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also there is need for careful consideration regarding copyright infringment. FFG is known to send out C&D letters to fan-pages sporting copyrighted material of their IPs (happened to a Netrunner Deckbuilder) and once you start earning money with a service that essentially ffg offer themselves (cardgamedb) you enter dangerous territory.

 

Back to topic: Great episode as always! Thank you for your episode guys and thanks for the links to the patreon website.
