We know he will be one Ranger and one Rohan hero. I think that the Ranger will be from the sphere of tactics, and Rohan from the sphere of Leadership. And in the next Deluxe Expansion we shall see, the Heroes of the Spirit and Leadership.

 

it's just my assumption. Who do you think they will be?

It would be nice to have a Tactics ranger and another Leadershit rohan hero, both are lacking these days.

 

Lets summon lore scholars into this thread. Which famous rangers and rohans hard enough to be heroes aren't still represented in the game?

Erkenbrand

Did a little research on him, and I think he's an extremely good fit for a Leadershit Rohan hero.

more difficult to determine Ranger Hero - there's no Hero trait only Ranger -  can be a Dunedain, Gondor, Silvan, Noldor - and this gives a lot of possibilities.

I hope this ranger is also a scout.

 

Also, the Rohan one is most probably going to be a warrior due to Captain of Gondor attachment spoil.

They tend to release those trait-themed attachments in the same pack with a hero they could be attached to.

So, in Galadriel's pack we'll probably see something noble.

Ranger will probably be Halbarad or Mablung although Halbarad would make more sense for this cycle.

I hope we get some kind of secrecy hero.

Galadriel is secrecy enough for me. Being able to freeze your threat level and draw you a card each turn...

Estel Edain made this post ages ago in another thread and he's been spot on so far.

For Heirs of Numenor and Against the Shadow, there were two from each sphere (Boromir, Hirluin; Beregond, Theoden; Pippin, Caldara; Mirlonde and Faramir). This wasn't true for Khazad-dûm and Dwarrowdelf, but it was true for Shadows of Mirkwood and Khazad-dûm, which were the first eight heroes after the Core set (Prince Imrahil, Dáin Ironfoot; Brand son of Bain, Boromir; Frodo Baggins, Dwalin; Bilbo Baggins and Bifur). It seems fairly likely that we will have two heroes from each sphere in The Voice of Isengard and the Ring-maker cycle. We've now seen previews for each adventure pack, and we know some information about each hero.

It's possible that she's an ally instead of a hero, though we already know that there are three other allies in this pack (Greyflood Wanderer, one Noldor ally and one Silvan ally), together with multiple cards supporting the Silvan trait and Secrecy.
>

> Since many Silvan cards are Lore, I expect that we'll get a Lore Silvan hero that (unlike Mirlonde) synergizes with Celeborn and Galadriel. We also know, from a Master of Lore interview with the artist of Silver Lamp [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/artist-spotlight-owen-william-weber/], that a new card for Haldir is coming. This new card is probably a hero, he's likely Lore, and he's thematically a perfect match for Celeborn and Galadriel. I'm guessing on the scout trait, but it matches Rumil's trait and we know that we'll be getting a unique Title attachment for scouts [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4739] (almost certainly Spirit, which would fit in a Celeborn/Galadriel/Haldir deck).
> 
>

> The last two heroes are more speculative. The designers have been developing Rohan in Spirit and Tactics. I think it unlikely that we'll get three Spirit heroes in the Ring-maker cycle, and especially not two in immediate succession. I'm guessing that the Rohan hero is Gamling from the quote at the beginning of the preview for The Antlered Crown. He's old, and he commanded the defense of Helm's Deep before Théoden arrived. (There are other possibilities, such as Erkenbrand or maybe even a Tactics version of Eowyn.) The Rohan hero could be Leadership, but is more likely Tactics.

If all of my sphere guesses are correct, that would mean two heroes from every sphere. Halbarad is definitely a guess, though there aren't many unused Tolkien characters that would fit the Ranger trait. Dúnedain, Gondor and perhaps Silvan seem the most likely associated traits. Given where the adventure pack is set and the focus on Gondor last cycle, a Dúnedain hero seems more likely than than a Gondor hero. If I'm right that the Ranger hero is Leadership, it seems unlikely that we would get two Leadership Silvan heroes in the same cycle. I doubt we'll see our third version of Aragorn or Faramir here, or another copy of Elladan, Elrohir, Damrod or Anborn. Mablung is a possibility, or perhaps an FFG creation. Assuming Idraen is a hero, I doubt that we would get another Dúnedain FFG creation in the same cycle. It also makes sense to have a Leadership Dúnedain hero aside from Aragorn, since most Dúnedain cards are Leadership.

The only thing he missed so far was that Haldir has the Ranger trait as well.

 

An artist, I think the same one who did Haldir, also had posted a picture to his portfolio of a Ranger named Mablung so I think that's who the new Ranger hero will be.

 

I personally think it's likely the Ranger and Rohan heroes will also have the Scout trait, or at least one of them will. Might just be wishful thinking though.

Indeed.

Mablung is probably coming, as his art was spoiled a while ago in another thread.

His sphere is unknown, but I'd guess tactics, as he was no leader.

That would leave a leadership Rohan hero for ap 6.

We already have three Heroes of Rohan from the sphere of Tactics (Hama, Theoden, Eomer) and only one from the sphere of Leadership (Theodred). And also the two Heroes Ranger from the sphere of Leadership (Aragorn, Elrohir) and one from the sphere of tactics (Elladan). That's a reason I think, that the hero of Rohan will be from the sphere of Leadership (Erkenbrand or another Hero created by FFG) and Ranger from the sphere of tactics. But that is just my speculation  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

We all known that Mablung's art was discovered a while ago, but with the Lost Realms reveal I am no longer certain if he is the other Ranger hero that we are getting in the Ringmaker cycle. This may be wishful thinking but it might be that since we already got one Dunedain hero and the next cycle will be focused on them that the next Hero in this cycle might be a Gondor/Ithilien Ranger. What do you guys think?

Hard to say, but considering the Haldir and Mablung art ended up popping up at the same time, I would assume that Mablung will be in this cycle. Besides, Mablung IS an Ithilien ranger, so he doesn't fit in the Dunedain box.

I didn't know that actually, thanks for pointing that out.
