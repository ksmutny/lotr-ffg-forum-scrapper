First, I know it probably isn't possible yet to do some of these, but I want to know from a strict rules point of view.

When do the Forced effects on quest like Out of the Frying Pan (TH 29) and The Dragon's Wrath (BoLT 3) happen?

Out of the Frying Pan : “Forced: Reveal 1 additional encounter card per player during the staging step.”

If Out of the Frying pan stops being the active quest during staging, does it's forced effect still happen?

***

The Dragon's Wrath :"Forced: During the quest phase, reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck."

If The Dragon's Wrath becomes the active quest during staging, does its Forced effect start?

If The Dragon's Wrath becomes the active quest during questing, but after staging, does it's Forced effect start?

***

Anduin Passage: “Reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck each quest phase.”

It isn't a “Forced” effect. If Anduin Passage becomes the active location staging does its effect start?

If Anduin Passage becomes the active quest during questing, but after staging, does it's Forced effect start?

***

Lastly, these quest all have the same basic effect of changing the number of cards revealed during staging, yet all have slightly different wording. Out of the Frying Pan and The Dragon's Wrath both have Forced, but Out of the Frying Pan says “ during the staging step”, while The Dragon's Wrath and Anduin Passage both say during/each “ quest phase”. Why?

I believe the correct way to do this by the rules is to follow the Anduin Passage model of making it not forced, but also changing the “quest phase” to “staging step” into something like:

“Reveal 1 additional encounter card … during the staging step.”

1) If Out of the Frying pan stopped being the active location during staging its effect would still occur as Forced effects occurs immediately upon the trigger which is the staging step of questing.

2) Although the wording is different the meaning is the same and if anything would apply from the beginning of the quest phase. Poor wording on that card.

3) No once you are passed staging and have resolved the quest phase and Dragon's Wrath is revealed as the new quest card you are passed the quest phase.

4) I'm not sure how it would become the active quest during staging.

5) No. As per 3)

These are my opinions based on my understanding of the rules and mechanics of the game.

Except, I didn't resolve the quest phase.  I have only resolved staging and The Dragon's Wrath says during the quest phase" and not "during staging".
