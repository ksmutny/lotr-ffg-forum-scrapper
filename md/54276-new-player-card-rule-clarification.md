# [New player - card rule clarification](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54276-new-player-card-rule-clarification/)

I was not able to find this anywhere in the forums. My question is about the "Song" cards. When the "Song of Kings" is attached to let's say Legolas, does that mean he gets both a Tactics Resource token AND a Leadership Resource token? Or does it mean Legolas' ONE resource token can be used to pay for both Tactics or Leadership sphere cards?

Thank you in advance for your replies!

Kevin

 The second one.  This question has been asked several times on these forums.

Thank you for the answer. I did a search for "Song Cards" and "Song" and "Song of Kings" and the only thing that came up were posts in the Star Wars LCG forums. So I am very sorry for the redundancy, but as I said - I was not able to find the answer...

 How strange... although I know that the forum software on this site is pretty wonky sometimes!  The tricky part for me is that I have to remember to search in the "The Lord of the Rings" forum, not the "Lord of the Rings" forum.

Thank you for the pointer...I did not scroll down far enough and only did a search in the "Living Card Game" section. I found the search option you mentioned and it brought up several posts.  I learned 2 things tonight! Thank you again for your help.

The "Living Card Game" forum is a general forum about the format itself. That can be pretty confusing if you don't know that. It doesn't actually search all the LCG forums as far as I know. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
