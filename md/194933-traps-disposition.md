Now that I've discovered that you can play traps on ennemies that have the text 'Cannot play attachment on this ennemy' (see ** below), I wonder :

 

1-when you play a trap and there is already an empty trap in the staging area, must you put it next to the other trap (on the right side of it) or can you put it before the other one (on the left side of it)? The idea is that you might want a different type of trap before a trap already in place for strategic reasons.

 

2-when an enemy enters into the staging area, must you attach it to the first trap to the left of the staging area or, if you have different types of traps in play, can you choose to what trap you're gonna attach the enemy?

 

Thanx! 

 

 

 

** Actually, Ranger spikes on those trolls is legal... from an old ruling in this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79258-trolls-and-ranger-spikes/?hl=%2Btroll+%2Branger+%2Bspikes]:

 

"You are correct. The Ranger Spikes are played into the staging area and not on the trolls. Therefore, the troll's game text 'Players cannot play attachmentson Troll enemies' does not apply. Cheers, Caleb"

 

Durin's Bane can't ever leave the staging area (and then return to it), but it seems like the Witch-King also could get stuck in spikes.

Don't all unattached traps attach to the same enemy immediately after it arrives in the staging area?

Yes, they would, however you choose the order (in the event that it matters).

Multiple simultaneous triggers are resolved in the order the player chooses regardless of how the Traps are placed in the staging area, and, yes, all the Traps will trigger and attach to the first enemy. This is why traps suck in multiplayer.

OK, so you choose on which trap you attach an enemy when you have multiple traps. That's great, thanks!

I think you might misunderstand, but I'm not sure.  All traps attach to the first enemy revealed.  However, you can choose in which order the traps attach to the first enemy revealed.

The trap exts mention ''attach to the next eligible enemy'', so yeah, I guess that if you have more than one trap, they all attach to the same enemy.

 

The flexibility of the traps, although, is that they attach to enemies that enter the staging area, meaning enemies that are revealed, put in play or added (when moving to a new quest card) to the staging area. Makes sense, thematically.

Rules Question:
> Hello! How is it with multiple traps in staging area and multiple enemies incoming here at the same time? Like trolls in We Must Away, Ere Break of Day scenario, or trolls in Conflict at the Carrock scenario. Can I choose which enemy goes to witch trap? Or one enemy goes to all trap? Thanks for your answer. Laco.

 

Hi Laco,

Whenever several effects resolve simultaneously, it is up to the first player to decide how they resolve. If you have multiple traps in the staging area when you advance to stage 2 of Conflict at the Carrock and add 4 Troll enemies to the staging area, the first player will decide which enemy to attach each trap to because they are all valid targets.
Now if there were multiple traps in the staging area when just 1 enemy was added to the staging area, then each trap would be attached to that enemy.
Cheers,
Caleb
