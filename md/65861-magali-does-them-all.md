Wow, so far 4 out of 5 Heroes in this cycle come from Magali. Like her art. Wonder if Brand and Bilbo had to do something with FFGs decision…..

 I really do love her art. Her illustrations are really great, and yes, she is taking all the light in this dwarrowdelf cycle.

Thanks FFG, and Magali. aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

Yes, the trend is there. 4 out of 5 heroes and 2 to 3 player cards in each pack.

I think they might eventually pick a few artists to do the majority of the cards to give it a uniform feeling. And then I think TB will be among them, I don't get that Brand hate, sure the guy is not exactly handsome but he still looks much better than a vast majority of people I meet in the streets. Now that Bilbo is a bit scary though.

I didn't mind the Brand that much… I really did NOT like Bilbo, though…  But I love the new Glorfindel!  Maybe it was just the specific pieces that people weren't keen on…. I can't imagine her ability has changed that vastly.

No, Bilbo and Brand are by other artists.
