I'm curious, if I have silvan refugee in play and somebody plays sneak attack, when the character is returned to the owners hand does that count as a character leaving play for silvan refugee?

Regarding songs that give heroes various resource icons, does that effect cards that require a hero to have a printed resource icon? For example if I use song of wisdom to add a lore icon to a non lore hero, can I then use a card that requires a hero with a printed lore icon?

Both of these things seem simple and obvious but I'm just double checking.

Thanks in advanced!

Sneak Attack states: "Action: Put 1 ally card into play from your hand. At the end of the phase, if that ally is still in play, return it to your hand."

Silvan Refugee states: "Forced: After a character leaves play, discard Silvan Refugee from play."

 

Yes, Sneak Attack causing an ally to return to your hand does count as character leaving play. 

- An ally on the table is considered "in play". it does not matter how it got there. 

- An ally being picked up off the table is leaving play.  It does not matter what game affect is doing it.

 

The song cards do not provide printed resource icons... I suppose only the FGG manufacturing process can do that ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The term "printed" I believe was put into use to  prevent players from using songs to make these cards work.  There was probably too much room for abuse.

Indeed, that's what I thought on both subjects, thanks for the reply
