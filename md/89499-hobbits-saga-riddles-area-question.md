Well ... I got at the point to play the Riddle scenario ... and I have a question

 

 

-Can I use cards like warden of healing to heal points on Bilbo ? 

 

-Can I play treasure or Baggins event cards for Bilbo whil he is in the riddles area ?

 

thanks !!

From what I remember no to the first question. I'm fairly certain Bilbo is considered outside of the play area of the rest of the heroes, and thus cannot be affected by the likes of Warden of Healing. 

 

Baggins event cards and stuff like Sting is fair game.

 

But it HAS been a while since I've played through to this part of the Hobbit quests.

I believe it follows the rules of a separate staging area.

I don't think Sting works as a result.

Yeah I think he is totally on his own, no Sting or anything.

Yes, that's correct Rapier and GrandSpleen, because Gollum only has 2 attack. So if you got Sting on to Bilbo, he would be immune to Gollum's attacks, and you wouldn't have to worry about that anymore. Which also means that Baggins sphere cards can't be used on him either. He's completely immune to all player cards. 

 

Quote from The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill Rulesheet under The Riddle Area section:

 

"Cards in the riddle area (including Bilbo Baggins) are

immune to player card effects and cannot leave the riddle
area except through specific quest card effects. While
Gollum is in the riddle area, he does not contribute his
threat during the quest phase and cannot be engaged by
the players. While Bilbo Baggins is in the riddle area, the
first player still controls him; however, he cannot quest,
attack, take damage from cards other than Gollum, have
attachments played on him by the players, or defend
(except against Gollum)."
