Does anyone have suggestions for what sort of deck to take since I've only played real multiplayer twice and have never played without knowing what heroes the other players  are bringing.

Do you know how the fellowship will be running? I sometime get the occasion to know my partner in advance so I can discuss what we are going to play. Some other time I can even choose my partner.

I have seen a lot of different things on the fellowship. A long time ago I see more competitive spirit, and a lot of decks look the same, now I see all kind of decks played, from the top ones to the strange "one hero Gandalf" who doesn't do a lot, but who is still well accepted by the community. So, no matter what you intent to play it will gonna be cool. If you have a deck that you really like you must take it.

If you want to have a good deck  I suggest you to build a polyvalent deck. Playing a fight deck on a fellowship is really dangerous because if you are paired with another fights decks you don't stand any chance to win. Be able to quest and have some test of will is good. Even better if you can also have some heal (warden of healing). Another advice could be that people don't enjoy doomed cards or Gandalf hero (because they can't play ally version) but I personally play them anyway ^^

I always make sure to have a deck like this on stand-by. If the group just can't work out issues with unique cards, I can step in with this an make things a lot easier.

This deck has always been lovely, but the fact that it uses hero Arwen is often an issue in the specific setting of trying to avoid uniques others might use.

Either make a deck with odd heroes or heroes that you could easily swap out. Bring a couple decks including sideboard cards. Try to include Ranged/Sentinel cards. Campfire Tales is great too.

I typically make two decks, one for fighting and one for questing. Most of the time, I end up using the pure questing deck. If you don't feel like bringing your whole collection, bring a few sideboard cards to replace any conflicts. In my opinion the people with access to more cards should be the ones changing their decks if there is conflicts.

I've had people just swap Arwen for Eowyn before in that deck and it's worked fine. Of course, Eowyn is another popular hero.

That's what we're doing for our Fellowship event (with a few other substitutions to better synergize with the other decks). We much preferred Eowyn against this quest because of her ability to add just a little more willpower when we were coming up close to being able to make enough progress.
