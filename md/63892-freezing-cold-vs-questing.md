Freezing Cold
Type: Treachery
Encounter Set: The Redhorn Gate
Snow.
When Revealed: The first player attaches this card to a hero he controls. Counts as a Condition Attachment with the text: "Attached hero gets -2 [Willpower] and cannot commit to a quest. If attached hero has more than 1 copy of Freezing Cold attached, discard attached hero from play."

Â 

If your already questing when this attaches then you still get to quest correct?

Yes. Best case scenario is of course to then draw Black Uruks (need 2+ players), making you discard an attachment from a questing character, thus Freezing Cold. Guess seeing those Uruks lights a fire in the hero.
