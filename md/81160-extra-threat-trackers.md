I've been trying to avoid buying another core set, but I've gotten tired of using dice to track threat in my three and four person games. I was wondering if there's anyone here who has purchased multiple core sets and maybe has some threat trackers going unused. I'd be willing to pay a few bucks and the shipping cost for them (domestic shipping in the U.S.A. anyway). A few extra counters wouldn't be amiss either.
