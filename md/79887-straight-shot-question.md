action: exhaust a WEAPON attachment to choose a non-unique enemy with 0 defense.  discard the chosen enemy.

is this a legal play:

bard the bowman makes a ranged attack against an non-unique enemy with 2 printed defense and 50000000 health.

i then exhaust a random weapon attachement from another hero i control to play straight shot and discard said enemy.

As the card is worded. yes!

Rivendell Blade is also quite good.
