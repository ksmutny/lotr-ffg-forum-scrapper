Does anyone know what these numbers are based on?

 I think they use a 7-sided die . . .

well i assume they are based on 'extensive' play testing, and are rated according to a pre-determined scale of difficulty

That is a given…

But what is that level of difficulty? Is it based on number of players needed to successfuly complete the quest?

 I think (but am not certain) that the quests are rated based on the 2-player difficulty.  I'm not sure what factors they take into account.  In fact, the whole process seems very mysterious.

The difficulty rating formula would be interesting for players who want to come up with their own quests.

I also believe that the difficulty rating can only be a guess during their playtesting.  All scenarios must get easier as you 'learn' how to 'beat' them, as well as there is more choice of cards to choose from for that 'perfect' deck.  The difficulty can change dramatically depending on wether 0-3 Gandalfs are available.  Would you even attempt an 'underground' or 'dark' scenario without lots of dwarves?

If like me you don't look at the scenario cards first time, I expect your success rate is low.  Eventually you 'know' the scenario and 'build' to beat it.  Thus its rating must drop.  The beauty of the game is, if it gets too easy, build weaker decks.  Surely I can't be the only one who doesn't enjoy it when I win easy.  Hanging on for as long as possible after a disasterous turn, is great fun!  When I design scenarios, many are rated by how well you did and not just on success or failure.  Minor/moderate/major success.  You can still fail but have the option to return safely after completing some of the quest.  This is more like 'real' people react.  Self preservation is strong, but cardboard characters feel no pain!  I would like to see more scenarios like this.  Cheers!

As i read or heard somewhere from designers the difficulty level is about what kind of encounter sets shuffled to create encounter deck.

And actually you can make all the quests more easy or more difficult by change some encounter sets in those quests.

 I have often wondered the same thing. There appears to be no rhyme or reason to the concept of challenge ratings for this game.

On a related topic (new player here), so the APs in a line of APs increase in difficulty as they go?  In other words, is Hunt for Gollum the easiest in that series and Carrick the second easiest?  I wish they'd put that on the pack!  That way I know what I'm getting myself into.  LOL

no they dont increase that way- seems random to me….they end in a climatic hard quest though, but thats to be expected

Of course, DLs in themselves don't really indicate the actual difficulty. So labeled DL7 quests, Carrock and Long Dark are two of the easiest quests available in my experience, only Passage Through Mirkwood is easier, whereas Road to Rivendell (DL4) for me is on par with Massing at Osgiliath (DL9).

this is a good point- a good example of this is that some of dams diffs ratings i agree with, some i dont….

the long dark i find easier even than mirkwood- mirkwood at least has 3 cards in play at the first round…..

road to rivendell i find easier than what dam says, probably about its 4

the first quest out of khazad dum (into the pit?) i found especially hard- much more so than its lvl 5

Journey to Rhosgobel is quite difficult in my experience. If you don´t draw some serious healing for the bird or are able to influence the encounter deck this one can be difficult to time properly.

Tried this quest-line a few times on nightmare mode in a 2-player and have been stopped at Journey to Rhosgobel because we couldnt find the Athelas in time (was real close last time though). Our build, which seems to be really good at the other scenarios, just fall short at Rhosgobel

Yes Rhosgobel is very difficult if you cannot heal the eagle.

That why my deck include all the time 3 copies of Lore of imladris. Now i change them for Healing herbs which is much better in my opinion. So with those healing cards you can heal every time eagle for 5 wounds and have much more time to find athelas.
