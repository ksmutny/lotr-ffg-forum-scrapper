 When the  orc guards come down at the beginning of the quest, they are said to engage you.  This means, that they are engaged with you, but you finish the quest phase, then the travel phase, encounter phase like normal before they actually can attack in the combat phase, correct?  In other words, they have only engaged you, nothing else.  I am hoping that is right, because that's what we did earlier today and blew right through them on the questing phase to win the game.  (having already defeated the nazgul in the second part of the scenario.)

 That's correct on all counts.  I don't know of any enemies capable of actually attacking outside of the combat phase.

Technically goblin sniper doesn´t attack. The card invokes a forced effect. And that effect is invoked "at the end of the combat phase" so even though the damage isn´t done during the normal defend and attack of the combat phase, it is still done in that phase

 Yes, I hate goblin sniper.  Actually, that brings up a question.  His card says, " During the encounter phase, players cannot optionally engage Goblin Sniper if there are other enemies in the staging area. " basically that means he can't be engaged while other enemies are in the staging area, but as soon as I or another player takes the last other enemy out of staging, the next player can engage him, right?

as long as there is no enemy in the staging area you can chose to engage him, remember that "in play" is more encompassing than "staging area" so you can engage him after you move all monsters to the engaging area. This means if you are in a 2 player game, and have 1 enemy in addition to the Goblin Sniper you can chose to engage the monster, there is no no monsters in staging area and can now engage the sniper. Remember players can only optionally engage a single monster each. and the engagement check happens b4 the threat level check.

Though you can use whats his face spirit hero to attack people in the staging area, use in fighting, gandalf .. etc.. there are ways to kill him off with out waiting to engage him.

 Yeah, usually dunhere is good for that, but sometimes he's not always in the game or exhausted.  I just find that sniper annoying!!!sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

Hmm do 2 goblin snipers in the staging area prevent players from engaging any of them?

Since their ability makes both of them impossible to encounter as there is 1 more enemy

Yep, you can't engage them. You have to use Dunhere or Gandalf to kill at least one of them. Beorn Beekeeper is a nice ally to kill both Snipers (but expensive). Descendant of Thorondor is made to kill Sinipers.
