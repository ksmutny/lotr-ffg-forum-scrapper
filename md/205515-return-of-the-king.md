I have to say that I also thought it was some news, but it seems I need to wait long.

There's always around 6 months between the saga releases.

... and I will cry if you don,t end up getting a nice Spirit Aragorn hero, which would be so thematic.

Last year we got two sagas, as opposed to one for each of the two years prior, what do you think about the timing of the final two? One for the con this year and one for Q1 2017? (Which of course means May or June)

Hey all. Geeezzzz...I really wasn't trying to throw anyone off, but I see now that I should have added a little more clarification to my thread title. For that I apologize. I was just curious because I have been away from the game for a few sets now.

It's okay. No worries. I had a good laugh about it.

So here's a bit more detail on the subject.

It's hard to use the word "typical" because there aren't really enough saga boxes with consistent releases to form a trend. However, one thing that has appeared to be consistent is the announcement of the next saga box. It normally seemed to occur within a month of the release of the prior box.

 

Road Darkens released: 10/03/14

Treason of Saruman announced: 11/03/14 (four week delta)

 

Treason of Saruman released: 04/23/15

Land of Shadow announced: 04/30/15 (1 week delta)

 

Land of Shadow released: 11/19/15

Flame of the West announced: - It's the middle of March (4 month delta) <--- this is why people are anxious

 

However, if you look at the Black Riders release to Road Darkens announcement the trend falls apart.

 

Black Riders released 09/20/13

Road Darkens announced 02/06/14 (4.5 month delta)

 

 

Bottom line, situation normal. We're all just REALLY excited excited for the next box!

I know, whenever an article post isn't by Trololo / John, I get a little suspicious.
