## 1 [Khamul The Easterling on January 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98042-nightmare-decks-info/?do=findComment&comment=968007)

For those of you that have played the first 6 (some of you maybe 9) nightmare packs, what do you think of them.  The amount of info on these (especially the first 3 Mirkwood ones) is very very little.  Which ones add the most difficulty, which add the least?  Do the new mechanics and cards to some of them make the quests a lot better while also being more difficult?  I don't want to know all the cards and mechanics (to keep it a surprise) but without mentioning specifics, anybody mind giving a little review on each of them?  They are pretty much the only thing I don't have yet but I'm still not sure if I want to spend the money on them.

 

Thanks

Khamul

Very short review for the first 4:

 

Mirkwood.  Really penalizes exhausting characters, so need to be very careful with that(one enemy gets +1attack for each exhausted character).  New Ungoliant Spawn is very nasty if she pops up during questing.  Adds high level of difficulty compared to normal

 

Anduin:  New cards can bring Hill Trolls back from Victory, more surging conditions, can get out of hand quickly.

 

Dol Guldur:  Basically impossible solo now.  New mechanic where your prisoner can be killed and you lose the game.  Would love to try multi, as it is verrry thematic now.

 

Gollum:  Unclaimed Clues go onto Mordor enemies at end of round.  New card that becomes engaged with you when 'looking' at a the encounter deck.  Still not super hard, but certainly gets around the strategy of just leaving clues unclaimed.

Also, if you want to see some spoilers, Grey Compant and Cardboard of the Rings have some card images on Facebook.

In brief, the encounter decks are now more thematic, more synergistic, more difficult, and just better constructed than the originals.

 

I'm curious to see the Nightmare decks for the encounter decks that are already thematic/synergistic but I'm sure they'll make them even more so, or just more difficult.

 

I love them.

Do you guys find yourselves playing the nightmare scenarios quite a bit?  When you're trying to figure out what quest to play, and you scan over your options, which ones do you have the feeling of "ehhhhh I just really don't wan't to do that one" and which ones are you like " ooo, that one is fun.  I think I might play that one"

 

Since I play multiplayer only about 2 times every 3 months, I'm thinking I won't get Dol Guldur.  But are the rest all totally worth getting and amazing?  From the little I've seen, Passage, Anduin, Gollum are all really good with nightmare.  Carrok seems a bit repetitive as the old one.  Same old feeling.  And Rhosgobel I'm not sure.

 

Thanks

Yes, I play them every time I get together with buddies. I'll probably never play the original versions again - or at least, not as often. Carrock is a blast and not repetitive, at all (to me).

 

The purpose in the design of nightmare decks is to:

 

A) make original quests more thematic (if possible)

B) make the quests more difficult (but not more frustrating)

C) make for a "tighter" experience

D) counter many popular strategies for beating the original scenario, so players have to approach the quest differently

 

If any of these appeal to you, I say get them all! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

My copies of the Nightmare Decks for Hunt for Gollum, Journey to Rhosgobel and Conflict at the Carrock arrived this morning. Looking forward to giving them a bash later.

I found the nightmare decks for passage through mirkwood and journey down the anduin to be a blast. Added great twists to old scenarios. I must admit, though, that despite ordering the nightmare pack for Dol Guldur at the same time as passage and anduin, as a mainly solo player, I have yet to build the courage to try it....

I have all the nightmare decks released so far (9 of them I think?) and I've yet to try them out. I'm afraid haha. I suck at this game. Easy mode gives me a challenge for crying out loud. Might give a go at some point, probably start with Passage and for some odd reason I want to do Hills of Emyn Muil as well.

I buy the game night kits from my local gaming store. They let me special order them. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Once I got the nightmare deck I very rarely play any other versions. Most cases the new cards are better though there are a few game overs before the 1st turn even starts in some of them, but this is fairly rare to actually happen.

I would say Hunt for Golum Nightmare add the lest difficulty of the sets so far.

yeah cause nightmare packs are not massively over priced as it is you want to pay even more... good thinking.

Not to mention game night kits come with sick playmats. That sell on ebay for atleast $30. Seems like a great value, my flagstore will only order them for events to keep it legit, which I respect, but wish I could get those game night kits!

there is more of a challenge, but it isn't as hard as some of the other nightmare decks.

The playmats are pretty small though I heard

Oh yeah, the new encounter deck is way better than the original, I just think in level of "increased difficulty" it is increased the least with this pack. Though I think it is a great improvement to the original, witch is a quest I have always liked.



> The playmats are pretty small though I heard

Yeah, they are useless. Also by the end of Darowdelf you would have like 6 of these useless things. There is a few good companies on the internet that make decent sized playmats in "mousepad" style I could get you the link for if you liked.

the play mats are standard play mat size for every other game i've seen (MTG, etc).

 

and no, some game night kits have come with a deckbox. there's no guarantee that it will always be a play mat with each game night kit. and they are of "mouse pad" quality.

 

i think the game night kits are a bargain - the price on the box is $25 - but i've heard of stores charging $30 or $35.

## 24 [booored on February 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98042-nightmare-decks-info/?do=findComment&comment=972125)

if the nightmare decks are $6.95 a pop (neither counting tax nor shipping) that is $20.85.

 

if i can get a game night kit - with a play mat and a poster (and months before anyone else) - for $25 - it's a bargain.

 

p.s. it's spelled "ridiculous."

Months before.. who gives a ****.. what is this a race?

Poster.. what are you 10? You put these up on your wall with blue tak and stuff over your bed?

they do not even cost 6 bucks... 5.60 I pay all the way over here in AU and in the US it is 5:40. lets say 6 then.. 6+6+6=18.. so at 30.. your nearly paying double.. and for what.. a bunch of crap

I just thought I would comment and let everyone know that I recently ordered all nine of the nightmare quests and have had the chance to play through the first three this week.  I've done initial play experience write ups on my blog for the first two so far and will do one for Dol Guldur soon as well.  Check them out if you'd like to learn more about them!  (Caution: They obviously contain heavy spoilers!)
