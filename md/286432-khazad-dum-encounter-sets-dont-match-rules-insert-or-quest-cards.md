# [Khazad-dum - Encounter Sets Don&#039;t Match Rules Insert or Quest Cards](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286432-khazad-dum-encounter-sets-dont-match-rules-insert-or-quest-cards/)

## 1 [Stewart777 on November 19, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286432-khazad-dum-encounter-sets-dont-match-rules-insert-or-quest-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3540109)

I had heard it mentioned that Khazad-dum had some errors in terms of quest cards but thought I had ordered a new version. Apparently not. The Misty Mountains encounter set is the one that seems to be missing from the rules insert and quest cards.

Is there are resource somewhere that can indicate which sets to use with which quests? Even Hall of Beorn doesn't have it listed correctly.

This is what the rules insert indicates:

Into the Pit: Twists and Turns, Hazards of the Pit, Goblins of the Deep.

The Seventh Level: Plundering Goblins, Goblins of the Deep.

Flight From Moria: Hazards of the Pit, Deeps of Moria, Plundering Goblins.

Oh wait, my bad, I just started reading through the rules insert and it says the Misty Mountains set is used in the Dwarrowdelf cycle...

So are the encounter sets as I listed above for the scenarios correct? Because this expansion is listed as being dated from 2011, not the newest reprint, and I had heard that there was a problem with the quest cards or something along that line.

The sets you listed are correct. You didn't especially list the set of the quest itself (e.g. Flight fro Moria), but that is pretty obvious.

There is a great site, which lists the sets and rules (and some other features) for each quest:

lotr-lcg-quest-companion.000webhostapp [https://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.000webhostapp.com/home.html]

It isn't quite up to date (listing the quest up to the Haradrim cycle Quest 1: The Mumakil).

Also, so far, the listed sets in my rules have always been correct. Some cards might have an error or aren't up to the recent erratas, but that mostly isn't that bad.

EDIT: linked to an outdated version of the site the correct (full up to date!) one is:

Thanks to Banania for correcting me!

Great thanks, another resource to use, much appreciated.

The only one I know of is the latest release, Roam Across Rhovanion. The booklet is correct, but the quest card encounter set icons don't match.

Oh man my bad, I must've heard wrong or remembered incorrectly. Could have sworn there was something about Khazad-dum. Ah well that's good news.

You are not entirely wrong. There is a typo associated with encounter sets in The Long Dark.

The encounter sets icons on the quest cards are correct
The encounter set icons in the rules insert are correct
The encounter set names in the rules insert are incorrect

Oops, thank you. Had the old link saved (as you might have guessed).
