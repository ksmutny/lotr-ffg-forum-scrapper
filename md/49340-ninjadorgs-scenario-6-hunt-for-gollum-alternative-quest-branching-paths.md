I dispensed with the sepia flavour text card sides this time. I developed this extra long quest a while back, but held off on finishing it until the new Gollum cards arrived, and the Clue mechanic ties into it nicely.
I think that this 'branching paths' idea is probably something FFG have already considered as there are hints of it in the Mirkwood quest, but I'm not sure how cost effective it would be for them to pursue - people might complain that they're not getting as many hero/encounter cards instead. In any case, hopefully the difficulty of this quest is a little higher than my other scenarios, you'll get a few more decisions about how it progresses too.

I have to confess I'm quite excited about play-testing this one. And if you don't have Hunt for Gollum yet you can replace the Gollum cards deck with the Spiders of Mirkwood deck (or your equivalent choice) instead.

Hope you enjoy it, here's a teaser:

You know I realized after reading your post on your blog that I realized this was not the Hunt for Gollum scenario coming out for Hunt for Gollum.  I must say the work you did to create this scenario and others on your blog are quite stunning.  They look as though they were made by FFG.  I liked the branching paths idea, it reminded me of those old "Choose Your Own Adventure" books I read as a kid growing up.  If you want to proceed go to page 12 and if you want to stay go to page 31 etc.  I wish they made more books like that, those were fun to read and aside from the initial opening chapter the book varied a lot on how it read.  That is what your scenario of the branching paths has done.

My question on printing them out though is are they already sized to print out as the size of the other cards or will I need some modifying?  I put my scenario cards on the clear card protectors.  I really want to try these scenarios out they seem like a lot of fun.  Though I am sure that solo would be quite difficult with two jailors  and an Nazgul.  But hey I would try it out.

Thanks for putting these up and working on these.

Thanks for your comments mate.  The official 'Hunt for Gollum' scenario is actually quite easy, moreso than Anduin Journey even, so we've been playing this Branching Paths adventure a lot more.

Yeah, that CYOA feel was kind of what I was going for.  I thought it would be nice to have different options of how to proceed, sometimes your heroes will be battered early and you'll want to heal, other times you'll just want to press on.  The FFG Mirkwood scenario actually already does offer alternate paths, but it takes the decision out of your hands.

If you print onto A4 Card and 'scale to fit' they should be just about right to fit into your card sleeves, mine did.

And remember, with 1 or 2 players you'll only face 1 Jailor - but yes, the Nazgul will still need tackling...

Yeah I had a hard time printing them out too. I eventually went with Landscape and increased the size by 130%. At least the text was readable then.

 FWIW someone is currently working on hi res scans of all the cards and he's going to upgrade these scenarios to hi res versions once that's finished.  I'll post more news when I can.
