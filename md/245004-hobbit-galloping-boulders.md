Hi.

Question about Galloping boulders card.

Galloping Boulders 
Type: Treachery 
Encounter Set: Over the Misty Mountains Grim 
When Revealed: The first player chooses a questing character. That character takes 3 damage and is removed from the quest. 
Shadow: Put this card on top of the encounter deck. 

The first player must choose a questing character only from his characters or from any player's characters?

 

UPD: I found answer - from any player's.

Yep.  It luckily doesn't say from characters "you control" so you can pick any players characters.
