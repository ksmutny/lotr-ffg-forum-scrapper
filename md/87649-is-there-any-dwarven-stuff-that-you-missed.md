I was thinking about dwarves in this game recently, and while we all know they are probably the most developed race in the game, I thought that there are still things that the designers have missed during the Hobbit boxes and Dwarrodelf cycle, thematically at least. First I would have liked cards with references to the different dwarf kingdoms such as the Blue Mountains for example, and the different "strains" of this race like the Petty-dwarves and the rest besides the longbeards. Also, I would have absolutely loved to have one or two of the lost Seven, perhaps if the cycle had been about a mission from a dwarf king to recover one of the Seven in Moria and encountering the Balrog in the end, for example, instead of the rather bland storyline we got for Dwarrodelf. What do you think?

indeed- everything above. also more weapons (one can never have too many weapons) and perhaps more importanty for me- instruments! i love the first chapter where the dwarves each have their own part to play in their epic songmaking.....and its a perfect way to fit in with the 'song trait'

Man I really hope to see this happen one day, but sadly we'll have to wait a LOT for that.

An attachment that gives another character the dwarf trait.

Lol, what would that be? Some sort of shape shifting potion? 

 

Also, what I would like to see more in general (not just dwarven-related), are more recovering lost artifacts kinda missions, ancient heirlooms buried or hidden in wood and cave, river and grove, that we must find; it doesn't matter if they're invented or not, but man that would be awesome.

lol, somewhere I saw a custom created playercard with a text, I think it was, "Short Legs - The attached character earns the dwarf-trait" :-D Nice idea, i guess.

I would like to see the hobbit heroes as allies at some point, so you can play with the whole company of dwarves in a solo game.

I don't think it'll happen (at least no time soon), but I would like to see Thror and Thrain heroes

And more mining-related stuff and precious stones!

Any sharp axe will do. Just chop the legs off at the knees. There you go, the character is a dwarf now.

Great idea about instruments! I'd also love to have ally versions of Nori and the deceased dwarves (Thorin, Ori, Oin) to fully assemble Thorin & Company in a solo deck.

Good stuff all! Yeah, I think fondly of the old Decipher game where they produced just about any item they could for the dwarves to get a pump in stats. Such as rings, bracers, throwing axes (as opposed to a two handed axe) helms and so forth. I really think they should produce more items for dwarves to equip, as the dwarves are, after all, the delving race.

i think all races, not just dwarves, should get 'personality' traits, much like the boons. dwarves would be fun, as you could give them the ones that represent their closed-mindedness, and their stoutness

Definitely they should have split the dwarf trait. (I've just posted about this in the thread about Gondor synergy in fact). 

Making dwarf a single trait will prove to be a huge error as the game continues to expand.
