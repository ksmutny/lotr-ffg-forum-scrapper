If I follow I the product code increment, it tells me that it was released after The Antlered Crown. Yet listeing to old Gray Company Podcast episode, I understand it was released around the same time of The Voice of Isengard... can anyone helps me on this one?

 

Thanks :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

... so it was before The Voice of Isengard?

 

Oh, Black Riders, sorry :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I believe it was released at GenCon alongside Blood of Gondor (5th AP in the Against the Shadow cycle). I don't know when it was then released to the general public.

It was released after Assault on Osgiliath

Unfortunately this list [https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/89618/lotr-lcg-product-announcements-and-launches-40] stopped getting updated around the time the Black Riders came out, but it shows the release date of everything up to that point.  Like Rajam said, it was right after Assault on Osgiliath, so shortly before Voice of Isengard.  It's very likely that they assigned product codes to the entire Ringmaker Cycle before they assigned one to Black Riders.

To add some approximate dates to this information, I received my copy of The Black Riders courtesy of a friend who purchased it for me at GenCon 2013. I had it in my hands in late August 2013 and had played through the three scenarios by October 2013. Hard to believe that's 3+ years ago, now.
