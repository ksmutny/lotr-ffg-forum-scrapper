 Does the refresh action for abandoned tools on the escape from darkness quest card mean that this action only occurs during the refresh phase?

Yes, that is correct. The bigger question is can Boromir untap himself 3 times to instantly complete the quest?

 And it doesn't matter that there is a current location either, correct?

There's absolutely no reason why he couldn't.
