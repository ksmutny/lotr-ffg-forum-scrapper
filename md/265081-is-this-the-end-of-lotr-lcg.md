With the new game announced, we now know that Caleb is going to be the designer. What will happen to LotR lcg? Is it going to be handled to another team? abandoned?

What do you think?

It is official that physical LotR LCG will go on.

Warhammer is result of Workshop breaking the contract with FFG, something that is out of their hands. So you're basically asking if Tolkien Estate gonna revoke FFG's rights to create in LotR universe? Well, why don't you call Tolkien estate then and ask them?

Not true. Warhammer 2 was gone because they invested in developing the new edition, warhammer 3. This happened after they said they will keep supporting the second edition :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

What are you even talking about, there existed no such things as "Warhammer 2 and 3" under ffg's development.

Yes they did. They are rpg's. Warhammer Fantasy rpg 2nd edition, owned by Green Ronin and then bought by FFG (saying they will keep supporting it), and then the dreaded Warhammer Fantasy rpg 3rd edition (see picture) developed entirely by FFG wfrp-preview1_lrg.jpg [http://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/images.geeknative.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/02204732/wfrp-preview1_lrg.jpg]

Well, if you want people to understand you, you should call things their names. I have Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay myself, and I wasn't able to understand your ambigious "warhammer 2 and 3". So, basically, some old RPG got a new edition, and because of that you no longer trust FFG when they officially say that the game will continue, while also announcing entire new cycle?

A ‘is the game dying?’ post. That didn’t take long.

in the announcement it said Caleb’s role in the digital game will become reduced as time goes on. And it said the tabletop game will continue alongside this. 

No, the game is not dying.  Go back to the shadow!

Given that they just announced a new expansions (https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/12/8/the-wilds-of-rhovanion/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2017/12/8/the-wilds-of-rhovanion/]) and the fact the LoTr the Living Card game is strong enough for them to push a digital version, I doubt the game is being abandoned.  The more likely scenario is that we will see at some point in the future a 2nd edition so that they can reset the game and make money on it a second time around.  If they simply abandoned the game they would loose the franchise rights to it, in particular since its clearly still profitable else they would not have made another expansion.

The game has aged very well, doesn't seem to be suffering for competition of any kind other than Arkham Horror which for them is a win-win scenario since they own both franchises.

The reason WFRP 3.0 failed is because it sold like crap right out of the gate, largely rejected by the RPG community for being too much like a board game during a era of OS revival which FFG failed to anticipate.  More importantly FFG did not ever at any point claim for WFRPG or any other game that they would "support it no matter what".  Support is ALWAYS based on sales and a game continues to get support as long as they are making money, this is how it has worked in every game, ever created, by every company that ever made a game period.  So the question isn't when will FFG kill the game, the question is how is the game selling.

I see it took you a while to understand. Next time I will add more pictures to the text for you. Do you want them of the type you can color yourself?

So, yes, it is basically this. I don't trust the word of a company that has already lied on a simar situation. I want to see if the game lives passed this new cycle.

It took me exactly the time it took for you to spell the name of the game in a way that it is actually called, not the way you refer to it numerically :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well, keep not trusting it, be my guest, too bad this company's word is all you gonna get.

I see it takes Very Little Provocation for you to become unreasonably snarky and offensive.

Even then, the only direct conflict will be among people who care only about game mechanics with no thought to lore.  As far as story is concerned, you don't get much more different than Tolkien and Lovecraft.  (Not only are the settings and time periods vastly different, but Hope is a prominent theme in Tolkien, whereas Lovecraft leans more towards Insignificance and Futility.)

As long as both the stories and the game mechanics remain enjoyable, I don't think FFG has to worry too much about either dying in the immediate future.

Exactly, it takes provocation, little or big. Otherwise I am a nice fella.

If nobody launches provocations we all can have a reasonable discussion in these forums.

The digital version will reinforce the paper version and vice versa. It is always great to have cards in hand and play with physical components while some times it is nice to have an extreme fluid digital card builder and play for 15 minutes the digital version ... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

That being said a few observations:

1. The Card game already as an extreme amount of expansions. Enough to be played for a life time even. I wonder where people get the time to play all these adventures... i have rougly about 50% of all packs ever published and I have still years ahead of me to play them all. Not even talking about extreme replayability.

2. There is absolutely no reason for a version 2 here. The LotR system was an extremely new card system and so I think the only possible way to go was digital.

3. The fact it is NOT competitive makes it quite unique in the digital competition too. It avoids the draining of money like Magic or Hearthstone while retaining that unique LotR LCG solo/coop play.

That being said: it ALL depends on the final,programming quality. As such we should wait and see. All too often the transition to digital is not exactly a huge success. There are far more failures than successes in this software industry.

The good thing is that the original LotR design has a rock solid play mechanic, so we only can hope that the programming staff is up to some Blizzard style polished product.

I agree with all of your points.  I think that it is unlikely that FFG will end LOTR LCG anytime soon for a few reasons.

1. They just released the digital game.  Contrary to what most are thinking, I see this as a possible benefit, albeit one that I will never play, but one that others may enjoy and may even bring them in to the physical card game.  This is also why we should be glad that it is NOT exactly the same game.

2. We are one of the largest LCG player communities that FFG has.  Certainly, we have significantly more posts than any of their other LCGs.

3.  They have never been limited to the characters or plot from the books.  So what if the saga has ended, still much more to tell.

4. Amazon LOTR.  While likely completely unrelated, public interest in LOTR will stay high and in people's mind which may help to boost sales and keep it going.

The app will also appeal to many people who may not be familiar with the physical game.  Some of those people will be content to just play the app, but others may be interested in trying out the physical card game, especially since the two are similar but not the same!

Has Prince Imrahil taught us nothing?!  Before burying this game, shouldn't we first check that it really has no signs of life?

The Rohirrim thought Eowyn had died from slaying the Witch-King and were bearing her off the field with Theoden.  Imrahil took a close look at Eowyn.

---

"Men of Rohan!" [Imrahil] cried.  "Are there no leeches among you?  She is hurt, to the death maybe, but I deem that she yet lives."  And he held the bright-burnished vambrace that was upon his arm before her cold lips, and behold! a little mist was laid on it hardly to be seen.

---

Meanwhile, Eomer was berserking all over the Pelennor Fields to avenge his dead sister.
