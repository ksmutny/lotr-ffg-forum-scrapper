I'm a bit unsure about what happens if Frodo is defending against an enemy with 6 attack, after knocking off 2 points for his defense does frodo take 4 damage thereby increasing your threat by 4 or can he only be hit with 2 because that is the limit of his hp, and therefore what happens to the rest of th damage.

Thanks

Well in that case you could raise your threat by 4 to cancel all damage dealt to Frodo, but remember that it works only once per phase (i myself forgotted that sometime ago...)

So example: Frodo defends against Hunters Of Mordor which power would be 4. You resolve it´s shadow card that does nothing, so in that case Frodo would be dead, but you decide to use Frodo´s ability to raise your threat by 2 to cancel that 2 damage that would been dealt to Frodo. 

 

I hope that this helped ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Hi,

Maybe I'm a bit daft but I still don't see an actual answer to the question. Frodo has 2 hit points and 2 defence. If the enemy attacking Frodo has a total of 6 attack, 2 of those are absorbed by Frodo's defence, so 4 points of damage remain.

As Frodo only has 2 hit points, would I gain 2 threat, or all 4 if I use his ability?

I'm a little confused by what Dwarf King was trying to say, but the answer is that you would raise your threat by 4.  His available hit points do not limit the amount of damage he would take.  That would be pretty broken and there would be little reason to actually block with him instead of taking it undefended.
