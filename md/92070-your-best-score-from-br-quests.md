So what are your best scores from the BR quests? Mine are:

 

A Shadow of the Past: 68

A Knife in the Dark: 59

Flight to the Ford: 50

 

I played with another player (2P) in standard mode using highly thematic decks which i will post in this thread later when i have some spare time.

 

We beat ASoftP in our first attempt and chose Gandalf's Delay and Mr. Underhill as our boon/burden cards. It took us three attempts at AKitD which we eventually won and then chose Tireless Ranger & Noble Hero as our next boon cards. FttF took us only two tries but we ended up earning two new burdens which wasn't all that good.

How about you guys?

Those are some impressive scores.

These are my scores for solo using the happy hobbit deck I put together. It's in the deck building section.

ASotP 83

AKitD 110

FttF 60

AKitD seems to be the toughest of the three. You score of 59 is really good.

Nice decks, they look great. Strong theme, looks like they fit the scenarios perfectly.
