If you enage them before they engage then it would apper the Forced action condition is not met. The rules differentiate between palyer and enemy enagegement even highlighting them when referring to enemies engaging a player. Have i read this correctly , I believe so as the card does not simply say when angaged.

 OOPs just noticed engagement is mutual ..... Ok supplemental , if I use Thicket of spears as no enemy's attack wil the shadow card defender or undefended penalties be applied, I have played no as defenders are linked to attacking enemy in th rules.

 You are correct. You should still be dealing a shadow card to each enemy that is engaged with you, but since the attack is prevented through an event played from your hand, the shadow card never resolves and is discarded. Feint and Forest Snare would work the same way.
