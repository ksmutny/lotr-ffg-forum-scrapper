Hi All:

I have been playing the Lord of the Rings LCG for about 2 months now, but want to get into A Game of Thrones LCG.

All my cards have been played with very little and are NM-Mint. I have used sleeves for the few spheres that I have played with.

My LOTR Sets Willing to Trade

Core Set
Khazad-Dum
Journey to Rhosgobel
Return to Mirkwood
Watcher in the Water

A Game of Thrones LCG I am Looking For

Lions of the Rock
Lords of Winter
Any King's Landing Chapter Packs

 

If you have any questions please message me or email at dvogtqb@hotmail.com

 

 

 

Thanks
