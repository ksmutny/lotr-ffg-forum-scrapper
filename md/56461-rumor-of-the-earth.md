From the spoiled french Return to Mirkwood on BGG

Rumor of the Earth
Lore, Event, Cost 0
Reveal the first card from the encounter deck. Then you may pay a resource to return Rumor of the Earth in your hand.

 

First I thought its to have a peek of the encounter deck like Denethor/Riversong but then I realized "reveal" means put into play. Why someone should want to use a card/resource to increase the danger in the staging area? Sure, it could be used in conjunction with the neutral event coming in RtM (which puts the top discarded encounter card on top of the encounter deck) to get back lost objective cards, but this seems very situational.

Any other ideas?

Well, of course I can only guess but I guess it will be the same thing as what Henamarth or Denethor do. Otherwise, I have no idea what it could be for, unless you really want to search the deck - like in Rhosgobel. I really doubt it though.

ok, I checked the original post on the French board and it says "look at" not "reveal", the poster at BGG obviously translated it sloppily (google translator).

IMO this card is a strong play. You can continuously know what is coming off of the encounter deck for only 1 resource a turn, and not worry about exhausting characters or character death affecting your ability to do this.

*edit* Shelfwear beat me to the post so I deleted about half of what I wrote.

I agree that being able to know what is coming is very powerful particularly in solo play where there often is only one card coming from the encounter deck.  Having the ability to know exactly what the threat total is going to be when questing and knowing what you can commit is an excellent advantage. Allows you to save characters for other phases.
