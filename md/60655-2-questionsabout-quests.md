This was probably answered in posts but its simple questions that I wanted to post it straight away instead of looking.

1- Conflict at the Carrock scenario...comes with 2 quest cards. Unlike the other scenarios it doesnt state when the game is won so am I correct in saying 'When 2B of the scenario is completed(Against the Trolls), players have won?'

2- A journey to Rhosgobel scenario...This is one helluva tough quest(even with healing cards). I find this to be over the top difficult! If your playing with non-green sphere you got like 10 turns at most to find enough 'Athelas' to reach 3B quest. That's insane lol!

My question is...a suggestion of which heroes U use to defeat this scenario would be nice?

1) Yes. There are only two stages, but you do have to defeat those trolls.

2) Denathor is my hero of choice for Rhosgobel. The treachery cards are what will kill you in that quest and he can help toss those to the bottom of the deck. Plus he's Lore, which helps you with your Healing cards and Forest Snares for those range/eagle only enemies.

It took me a long time to beat Rhosgobel (solo or otherwise), but when I finally did, I think my heroes were Denathor, Beravor, and Eowyn. Denathor and Beravor used their special abilities pretty much every turn.

2.denethor, eowyn and dunhere, play fast, have plenty of treachery cancellation, and use denethors deck looking to your advantage

ive won this in two ways

1. play so fast that you dont need any athelas and just used player deck cards ie. lore of imladris

2.played slow and collected 3 athelas and 2 lore of imladris to have a huge amount of healing

This quest is hard for solo players and not in a good way. I have a open competition that I tried to get running a while back were I was offering a free pack form the coming darowdelf ap for anyone that could win this scenario with me spectating in lackeyccg, using only core + the 3 aps (to simulate the game state when this ap came out) and win 3/5 games. NO ONE could do it form the people that tried and the reward is still unclaimed.... so this should tell you ... the quest is stupid hard solo and while you can win it you're hard pressed to win it multiple times in a row.

Denathor is your best hero for this to dig out the athlesses, legolas for handling crows and stuff and then Elenore to cancel those crazy treacheries. Either way, very hard.

Try playing a custom rule on this one for solo. 1 wound a round instead of 2 makes a huge difference, and some people even start with zero wounds on him.

I actually tried that 'altered rule' ... (1 wound to kill it all, 1 wound instead of 2, 1 eagle to undue the fall and in the athenas heal it all) lol

k nough with the pleasantries lol! Honestly, even with that rule its still pretty hard.

Thx for the suggestions guys :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
