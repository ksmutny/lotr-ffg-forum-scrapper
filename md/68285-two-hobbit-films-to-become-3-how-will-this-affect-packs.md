first is this true? ive heard it on a different forum….anyways i couldnt care less about the films- what i do care about is what this means for the packs…i assume ffg will be sticking to the two saga expansions that are already in development

aparently jackson's pulling material from the appenidces….some maybe ffg is doing that too?

If it happens, and I think if it happens the third film will be a bridge between the Hobbit and LotR, it shall have little to no impact on the game, I feel.

 I too think that it will be a bridge film between The Hobbit and LOTR and not really a "Third Hobbit Film".  I know that is the term being used, but principle filming for the two films is done and the actors have gone home.  Now if it happens I think it will largely focus on the early years of Aragorn (Thorongil and Estel) and Arwen.  We might even get to see the Elladan & Elrohir.

Balin retaking (and losing) Moria would also be on the table.  A lot depends on how much of The Necromancer being driven out of Dol Guldur is shown.

I think there being three films will NOT affect FFG's release strategy at all. Remember where the license is - with the books, not the films. Also, another company now has rights to games linked with the films so FFG wouldn't be able to "imitate" what the film is going to do with splitting the story - the two box split wasn't following the original film setup tbh, it was just logical to not put it all in one box and Goblin Town/Misty Mountains is a good middle point.

good point- ffgs following the movie time release is so convincing i forgot for a moment they dont have any connection ……..not that im complaining on that last point

Yeah, I also agree that it will have no affect on the game or the deluxe boxes. Remember, there being two Hobbit boxes and there being two Hobbit movies didn't really have any connection, as we are getting both Hobbit boxes rather soon, while the second movie wasn't coming out for another year. Now we'll still be getting our two Hobbit boxes and the three movies won't have all hit theaters until December 2014.

While I'm sure FFG wants to tap into the movie anticipation I doubt they'd break up these specific Hobbit boxes and make us wait two and a half years for all of them.

What's more likely, that I'd expect, is that next year and the year after, we'll see some other new Hobbit related boxes or adventure pack cycles, either dealing more with the Hobbit appendices, or more Hobbit adventures they skipped over, etc. unrelated to these two incoming Hobbit boxes, however.

lol… I was gonna reply with the EXACT opposite conclusion…  Too much of a timing coincidence between movie-hype and… "Oh, hey!  Let's do an out-of-cycle saga edition!!  What, you mean PJ is also doing a movie of the same material?!?  Wel, shoot, who would have guessed we would be so lucky???"

I'm NOT complaining, BTW.  Like many of us here, The Hobbit was (and is) one of my first and favorite novels ever, so I will take every possible form of it I can get.

I just chuckle at the timing of "non"-movie related merch.  It's the cynic in me.  If it walks, talks, quacks, and craps like a duck….  you know the rest ;-)

I think the only worry is how much stuff will be out there and sometimes spreading out similar stuff means less money to go around, and it may well be the film license chucked down the throat of potential players.

Currently, we have an excellent card game here from FFG and a brilliant rpg from C7. I've just picked up the War of the Ring 2nd edition box set, not sure if FFG are handling US versions of this still, but it's with another company in the EU and UK now. And to add to all the great stuff above, another company has rights to making film-based card games, board games and not sure what else, all looking to be ccgs (with the rare card problem, ie overpriced and hard to get - and the reason why I buy FFG and won't buy the other upcoming card game). I hope the film based ccg/board games do not make it difficult for the companies who are basing their products on book-based only.

I hope that FFG doesn't take a hint from the third film. Jackson's work is entertaining, and succeeds on several levels in bringing the books to life, but too much is changed, added, or removed in the transition to film. I know Legolas is from Mirkwood, but must he appear in The Hobbit films in more than a cameo capacity? I suppose there is the Battle of the Five Armies…

What company has the rights to the movie based card game? Is it still Decipher, or did someone else take over?
