i dont see any problem with this but just in case...at the final escape check on gollum playing Dead Marshes, he had no resources on him, so therefore i dealt no encounter cards to do the check and automatically won...this right?

 

thanks

 Almost as you need 1 Willpower to win that escape check. A tie (0 vs. 0) in your case in considered a failed check.

Yeah, this is fine. Commit any character, so long as he/she has some willpower, and you win since there are no cards to be dealt. I've finished the game a couple of times this way. This is what the Rohan deck does for you.
