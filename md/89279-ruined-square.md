if you use west gates action to search for another osgilliath location, and choose the square, how does the surge work?

do you shuffle then surge, or does it not at all?

thanks

i would just like to bump this to see if anyone knows the answer and also becuase i have a second question

 

can you travel to the ruined tower normally, or do you have to have do its action of having 2 active locations?

thanks

Normally you need to shuffle anyway after a search. So that would be:

 1. Search for the square in the Encounter deck and reveal it
 2. Shuffle
 3. Surge
 4. Make West gates the active location
 5. Shuffle again

It is a bit awkward. Shuffle in step 2 may be unnecessary, since you do not change the order of the cards. But this would prevent cheating (selecting the location after knowledge of the first card of the Encounter deck, which would be the surge card.)

 

You could drop an email to Caleb, he is very responsive (and kind).

I think ruined square would still surge because the west gate says to "REVEAL, then add to the staging area" if it was just added I don't think the surge would trigger so the word reveal was purposefully put in...not that I know why anyone would willingly choose the action for west gate (that is until FFG errata's it with the line "players may not travel to the west gate" like I'm sure the intent was)

For the ruined tower, I've been playing as though you need an active location to travel there as the first line in its travel action is "if there is an active location in play". So you would not be able to travel to the tower if there were no other osgiliath locations

Could be wrong on all of it, that's just how I've been playing

I always assume what is not prohibited is allowed, so I would say yes (until the next errata maybe :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

thanks for the responses, i think the shuffle makes sense, as for the tower it is a little ambiguous, i shall see what caleb says

hmm, interesting. did he say anything about west gate?

## 9 [richsabre on August 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=851962)

no, this was his reply

Hi Richard,
If there is no active location, then you do not have to exhaust a character to travel to Ruined Tower.
The surge keyword is only triggered when you reveal the card with surge. For this reason, some search effects say "search for an encounter card and reveal it..." If the search effect does not say to reveal the card, then you do not trigger surge.
Hope you're enjoying the scenario!
Caleb

 

however i read that west gate is different to the tower in that you have to do its action to travel....becuase it doesnt say 'if there is X, do Y to travel....' it just says 'do X to travel...'

I thought that Actions were completely voluntary? Do you mean that for a location with an action, this action has to be done to travel here (in other words, that this overrides the normal travel rules by the golden rule? Why calling that an Action if it is a prerequisite then?)?

Furthermore, what is the difference between "Travel" and "Action" on a Location card? I will look at the FAQ again if I missed something.

on second look probably not, as it would say cannot be travelled to or similar

I'm playing West Gate like it's a forced reaction (which it probably should be). However as it is labelled as an action, I think the player can choose to travel there. It makes little sense though. The only reason to do this that I can imagine is that players wishes to bring East or West Quarter into play so that they can use their keywords once West Gate has been explored.
