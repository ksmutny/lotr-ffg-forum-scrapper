 I have completed all the quest tokens for the last stage of the Mirkwood quest and am waiting to draw the enemy Ungoliant's Spawn in order to finish the game, and then a location card comes up in the staging area, do I have to go to the new location too, or ignore it? If so, does it remain in the staging area or go to the discard pile. Thanks in advance (great game btw)

Yes, you have to keep going as normal, unless it is specified otherwise on the quest card.

This is from memory, but I think 3b makes you dig up 1 spider of choice.

Ungoliant's spawn is a spider, so you don't have to wait until it pops up.

You can just fish it out of the encounter deck starting on 3b.

Thanks for swift reply. The card states, "Players cannot defeat this stage while Ungoliant's Spawn is in play. If players defeat this stage, they have won the game."

 

I read this as having to wait until it comes up in the natural progression of play. Do you think I can fish it out and place it immediately into the staging area?

Ah, I thought you were on the other 3b card.

But you stated that you put progress on it, so my bad.

It states as you say, and if Ungoliant's spawn is not in play, you win the game.

So you already beat it, with 10 progress on the card.

 * Ah, I see! So, as he Ungoliant's Spawn had not yet been drawn, he is not yet in play, so I have already won.

I don't need to wait until he comes into play, right?

 

Thanks.

no, you dont have to wait, as long as you are on beorns path 3b, and not the one that tells you you have to find and kill the spawn. its a luck thing with this quest on 3b. you want of course to draw the 3b that you just have to place 10 progress on, and not have to go through killing the spawn ...

Thanks everyone. What do you know, I had already won and I didn't even know it.

 

On to the next quest!
