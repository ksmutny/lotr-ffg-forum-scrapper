1. Objective cards

Guarded: When attached card is also an objective card, put it in the staging area, and deal both objective cards an guard card?

2. If attached cards dealt, are we gona claim the object immediately? What if we leave that object there? Can we claim it later/ anytime?

3. We always setup quest 1a first then enter the resource phase?

 

 

 

 

## 2 [Cutievalkyrie on October 15, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72765-several-questions/?do=findComment&comment=709511)

 And…when to reveal the attached card of the objective? And after that cards gone, when to claim the objective card?

Sorry but whats in the rule book is just "guarded"and "Objective"s definition.

## 3 [Angus Lee on October 15, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72765-several-questions/?do=findComment&comment=709529)

"Guarded" keyword is explained in details on p.24 of the rulebook,

"If another objective card comes up
while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place
the second objective in the staging area, and use the
next card of the encounter deck to fulfill the original
keyword effect."

After the encounter card attached to an objective has been dealt with, it will go back to the staging area; you can claim that objective as per the instruction on the objective card.

Follow the steps on setting up the game, including following the instructions on quest 1A, and then flip it to quest 1B.  Then start your first turn from resource phase.

Follow up on this thread (thought I just posted this, so sorry if a duplicate comes up later):

After an objective card becomes unguarded through the guarding card leaving play, does that objective card remain unguarded until claimed (or otherwise disposed of, e.g., the Dungeon jailer)?  Or, are encounter cards revealed during staging in subsequent rounds placed in the staging area so as to guard any unguarded objective cards?  I'm favoring the former interpretation of the rules on p. 24 of the Core Rules -- just hoping to get the opinions of others.

Thanks!

It remains unguarded.

Thank you guys,  now my questions are detailed:

1. So i can use Eleanor to replace the trap card(guarding card), cant i? It seems like the games already started before phase 1.

then what is this phase? Phase 0? Is this considered to be a new round? Can we use Glorfindels healing skill again if we have used his skill in the former round?

2. "…and  use the next card of the encounter deck to fulfill the original keyword effect."

Does it mean the "attached" objective card will be put in the staging area and will not  have an encounter card? Only the first objective card will be guarded.

Since "the next card" is a single card. The rule doesnt say anything about if we should draw another card to attach to the "attached" objective card when its put in the staging area.

3. When an objective cards unguarded, any of our heroes can claim it at any time, is this correct?

 4. Can we have 2 restrict attachment and 1 unrestrict attachment cards on 1 hero at the same time?

Thanks for the verification Angus Lee.

1.if a guard card is a treachery, elanor's ability can be used during set up to cancel it as its a response not an action. then the next card will (i believe) not guard the objective

2.if you draw say …

1st objective

1st guard card….which is an objective

you then draw another card for the 1st objective THEN another card  for the 2nd, thus meaning ALL objectives end up guarded

3.depends on the objective- some you need to exhaust a hero, some say you need to do X in order to claim the card, ie HFG you need to quest successfully

4.yes

As Rich said if the guarded card is an treachery then you can use Eleanor's response to cancel it, but…

 

I do not agree with rich when he says

Because Eleanor's response says "Exhaust Eleanor to cancel the "when revealed" effects of a treachery card just revealed by the encounter deck. Then, discard that card, and replace it with the new card from the encounter deck."

 

So I believe that the card that replaces the canceled treachery replaces it in guarding the objective card.

I agree with CJMatos' ruling. Elanor's ability is a "replace" not an outright cancel.

You are welcome!

Also I concur with CJMatos' ruling regarding Eleanor's effect on the Guarded keyword.

1. As rich has said, you cannot use Actions during game setup (as there are no Action Window), so you cannot use Glorfindel's ability.

4. To elaborate, you can have up to 2 restricted attachments and unlimited number of unrestricted attachments on any single hero at the same time.

 Thank you. This post is very informative to me,

For an objective card "when its free of encounter to claim", does it mean i can claim it anytime with an action?

as above it depends on what that objective is- the card will state when and how you can….hfg clues need successful questing first

## 15 [Cutievalkyrie on October 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72765-several-questions/?do=findComment&comment=710180)

 For Example, 

Gandalf's Map
Type: Objective
Encounter Set: Escape from Dol Guldur
Item.
Guarded. Restricted.
Action: Raise your threat by 2 to claim this objective when it is free of encounters. When claimed, attach Gandalf's Map to a hero you control. (Counts as an attachment. If detached, return Gandalf's Map to the staging area.)
Attached hero cannot attack or defend.

 

The card says " claim this objective when it is free of encounters", does it mean i can claim anytime/in any phase when its free of encounter?

What action is needed to claim it? Respond or Action? Or just a free action which can be used anytime?

## 16 [ArachneJericho on October 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72765-several-questions/?do=findComment&comment=710182)

 It's not a response, it's an action. Look at the card text: claiming this particular objective is an Action and thus can only occur when player actions occur and it is no longer guarded.

Ok.  Very new to the game, but already hooked… I THINK I am asking the same basic question as 4…but I am not sure I am understanding the response….  Once I remove the encounter card attached to the objective card in Escape from Dol Guldur, 1) Do I have to take the hit listed immediately and accept the card (generally attaching something nasty to a hero)?  2) If I can leave it there, does a new encounter card somehow ever get placed with it?

once you clear an objective you can leave it there and it will not get 're-guarded'
