1. Yes, they are neutral cards.

2. A player pays the card's cost and attaches it to a hero. The card gives that hero the stated resource icon in addition to the one printed on the hero card.

3. They are excellent for mixed decks.

These neutral cards allow you to put Leadership cards in a deck with no Leadership Hero (Song of Kings) or, Lore cards without Lore Hero (Song of Wisdom).  No doubt the other 2 spheres will be covered in future expansions.  Cheers!

The song of Battle (tactics) is coming in the Dead Marshes expansion, which probably means the Song for the spirit sphere is coming in the Hills of Emyn Muil.

Nope. It seems in each expansion there are ten new cards. One Hero. Two cards for each sphere. And one neutral card.

The neutral card for JTR is Radagast.

Ahhh. OK. Hopefully I'll get it soon.  Cheers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
