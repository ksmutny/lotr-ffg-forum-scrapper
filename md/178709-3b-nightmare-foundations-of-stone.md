Hey all. Just wondering: when 3B is revealed and I have to discard my attachments and discard allies until I only have 6 cost remaining, do I choose the order in which they're discarded? Or is it simultaneous? I'm wondering if Horn of Gondor would be triggered for all the allies that get discarded. Thanks!

Both. Since it's simultaneous, the first player choose the order.
