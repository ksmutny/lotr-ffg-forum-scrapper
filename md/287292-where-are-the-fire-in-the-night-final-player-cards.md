So, we're still missing the full text on two of the Fire in the Night player cards
Quicker Then Sight and Outmatched

Anyone have those yet? I'm super anxious :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I haven't seen any yet myself, but someone here (I forgot who) made a pretty good prediction of what Quicker Then Sight reads:

"Response: Return a Silvan ally you control to your hand to cancel a shadow effect just triggered during combat."

As for Outmatched they thought it might be a Faint in Trap form. It would attach to the next enemy that engages you and would make it not attack or something.
