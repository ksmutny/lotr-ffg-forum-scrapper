I think that this would be a great coop style card game in the same vein of the lotr lcg. What do you think?

 

Mixing and matching members of crews wouldn't be so far fetched because they all, apart from TOS, were in about the same time period. TOS can be saga expansions. 

 

Any thoughts?

I've been clamoring for a Star Trek cooperative LCG for awhile. I definitely think it's a great idea!

When they announced the current one that was what I was hoping for. Or an LCG that could do both...

I use to play Decipher CCG Star Trek 15 year ago……For me it was a bit boring….. But since FFG start to use some mechanic from old Decipher card game ( good example is new Warhammer lcg ) maybe we will see new version of Star Trek…..

 

What i really love to see is a DUNE lcg…….

A Star Trek LCG in Coop Style. For 1 - 4 (or 6) players?

 

I'am all in!!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

That would be great! I love the Star Trek Franchise.

I would love another co-op LCG, but not Star Trek as I'm not the fan of it and I do not dig the theme.

Generell would be another co-op LCG great.

 

Wich theme you would prefer?

 

Star Trek would in my opinion perfect for a co-op game. You can use the different branches for Deck building.

 

- Star Wars (group of Jedi) will work too, but there is already a Star Wars LCG.

- Dune is more like Games of Thrones

- BattleTech would be great - but no co-op (Solaris VII for example)

 

There are not much theme they work great with co-op games

Call of Cthulhu/Warhammer(doesn't matter if Old World or 40k) Co-Operative LCG would be perfect for me.

I used to play the first edition of Deciphers Star Trek CCG, and I loved it, but finding opponents to play against became very difficult, so I stopped playing. I'd love a new Star Trek game, though. Something like LO|TR where you can play solo as well as co-op would be brilliant.

As much as I'd like to see a new coop LCG (that isn't Star Trek), I don't see Warhammer (fantasy or 40k) as a coop game. CoC may be a good call, though that can be done through some deluxe expansion for the existing CoC and not a standalone game.

There are plenty of RPG products of Warhammer both Old World and 40k, I can't see how making a co-operative LCG is a problem.

And RPG's of Warhammer are exact proof that Co-Op fits. (that's because they're technically co-op, if you haven't guessed yet)

What does one imagine when they think a co-op star trek game could work? Going on away-teams together to solve interplanetary disputes or fight klingons? The repeated problem with making a game for Star Trek is that while it can inspire ideas for strategic space games, like the Decipher ccg, the heart of what makes star trek great isn't the characters or any setting, it is the ideas and allegories through the characters. What I'm saying is that anyone with the same kind of love for Star Trek as we seem to see in this LOTR game will hit a wall with never making something that is true to the source, that makes any sense as a star trek game outside of pictures of big space boats.

I get what you're saying. Loving Trek all my life, the big ethical and philosophical questions at the heart of great Trek is impossible to replicate in a game. Still, I think a cooperative LCG could take the "adventure" approach of LOTR LCG and adapt it into a "mission" format. The problem with many Trek games is they have too big a scale, whereas an LCG with constant expansions could take the time to develop individual missions/episodes with a developed story and throw in some different paths/conundrums for players to solve. From a mission focusing on exploring a new star system to stopping a Borg invasion, there's plenty there to make an interesting card game, if not allowing you to live out the show exactly.

So you like a pathfinder style co-op game for 40K and/or Fantasy. That will be work and FFG have the RPG rights....

 

Since for Fantasy don't come more AP's - that can be work...

I'm confused because I can't quite understand what are you trying to say here. 

 

If you're talking about pathfinder advanture card game - no, I don't like anything like that in Warhammer setting. I would like a "real" cooperative card game set in any of Warhammer universes. By "real" I mean games like LCG's of FFG, not dice rolling fest.

Sure, but they are usually on a small scale (an elite squad, a small investigation group or so) and frankly, Warhammer is more about epic battles, so on a larger scale the coop won't work much.

Strange, because most RPG Warhammer scenarios I've seen are on a small, Co-Op LCG fitting scale.

Examples: Investigating Slaanesh cult in town (Peril in Pelargir, Stewards Fear, Trouble in Tharbad), trying to escape from the area that will get orbital striked soon (Escape from Dol Guldur, Flight from Moria, Flight to the Ford), and etc. etc. etc.

 

Warhammer is a universe, it's not "about", it's a container of content which can be utilized to create literature, games, movies and etc. There is nothing standing between them and real Warhammer Co-Op LCG.

 

Speaking of which - http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=118&enmi=Death%20Angel [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=118&enmi=Death%20Angel]

But it's not the type of card game I'm talking about, It's a boardgame that happens to use cards as it's main components.

OK, you are correct. It would be great, than you have to roll many dices in a LCG. That's to random. I use it as proxy for an RPG like card game. But that wasn't a good one.

I was talking about setting. The LCG itself would use no dice, obviously.

I know this might sound crazy, but the best star trek-based game on any media I've played is this one:

http://www.wixiban.com/ccg/skybox-sttcg.htm [http://www.wixiban.com/ccg/skybox-sttcg.htm]

It let you craft your own missions to go on, with a mission, plot, and discovery, giving your opponent chances to play enemies or spatial anomalies or whatever to stop you along the way. I saw this thing in a bargain bin back in high school, we played it like 3 times and threw it out but I still think this was the best to staying true to the source material. You could have great missions like "The USS Enterprise proceeds to explore an uncharted region of space, despite an alien warning buoy..." when Wyatt Urp attacks Kirk!

Then it should be a co-op game in the Fantasy or 40K setting, it have to be a group with a common goal - so it is the RPG setting. Why shouldn't that work?

The main problem with a 40K or even fantasy Warhammer Co-Op card game like LotR is that people have connections to every faction.  Because in the table top you can play any group when you go to a card game people want to play a deck based on their army.  Most of the Roleplaying stuff works because it forces you to all be Space Marines, or at least all Imperials.  

But I play Tau and would want to build a Tau deck.  And have friends who play eldar orc and Necron.  Letting everyone make the deck they want would make it hard to then have you work together.  And if you are just forced to play Space Marines then it is a lot less interesting to half the fans.

It's not a problem.

 

Old World of Warhammer has many similliar affiliations like LotR. Main races would be Reiklanders, High Elves, Wood Elves and Dwarves, which then can be sorted by the traits correposnding to their origin and sort of activity. The are also Halflings, Ogres and other sorts of humans like Bretonians.

 

As for Warhammer 40k, If we take just Imperium of Man, there'll be plenty of different characters to go as heroes and allies.

Eldar were also allies from time to time and stuff, so they could be recurring. (Check Relic characters) And Co-Op LCG of that sort would not be about giant scirmish between huge armies, so I can't see how are you going to put all those races you listed together and why.

 

As for "if you are just forced to play space marines" - tell it to the digital Warhammer 40K game developers who keeps bringing space marine games over and over, ignoring whole existance of other species.

Oh I totally agree that far to many 40K games are Space Marine based.  I understand that is the core of the source material, but still lots of cool stuff could be done with others.

 

But back on Topic I think a Star Trek game could be great.  You don't make it exactly like LotR of course, but you could have it where you start with a Captain and a Ship, and card you play are bridge crew people as well as ship upgrades and I am sure other things as well.  Then maybe you have away missions you send guys on, maybe have them take longer than a single turn of questing like LotR where you have to pick guys to go off and do things for multiple turns.  

 

Yes you can not have that same feeling you get from the show that people are talking about.  But if you can capture the flavor of Star Trek it could be great.  Set it around the time that Star Trek online is.  Slightly after Voyager and Deep Space 9.  Lots of definition to the galaxy all kinds of cool stuff you could do.

As a huge Trekkie I would LOVE to see a coop LCG made out of it...but it will never happen. To the best of my knowledge WizKids owns the rights and aren't planning on selling them or letting them lapse. 

 

But yeah--the setting DOES seem perfect. Of course you would never be able to fully replicate the more complex moral themes but you could make a fun game in that setting and the coop format WOULD allow for players to work together towards a common goal.
