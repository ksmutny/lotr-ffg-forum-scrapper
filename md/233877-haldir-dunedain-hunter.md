Really quick and simple - If I play Dunedain Hunter and get an enemy from the encounter deck, and put it into play engaged with me, does that disqualify Haldir's ability?

I believe it does disqualify his ability. Typically any kind of engagement is treated as the same trigger.

Haldir: Combat Action: If you have not engaged an enemy this round,...

 

FAQ: (1.49) Engaging enemies vs being engaged
When a player engages an enemy, that enemy has also engaged him, and when an enemy engages a player, that player has also engaged that enemy. There is no difference between engaging an enemy and being engaged by an enemy.

 

That doesn't strictly speak to "put into play engaged with", but I would be very surprised if doing so didn't qualify as the enemy engaging you.

As such, you couldn't use Haldir's ability. (Haldir doesn't care how or why an engagement happened, only whether one has).

But i think "enters play engaged" is more about position than action, i am not engaging, nor am i being engaged, but it simply enters play there.

Are there any rulings on similar situations i can refer to? Because to me this is a bit like revealing an encounter card vs the encounter card being put into play, which are different. A card being put into play is not revealed.

This is addressed in the FAQ.

> Q: If an enemy is put into play directly engaged with me, has that enemy “engaged” me for the purposes Forced effects or Responses that trigger from engaging an enemy?
> 
> A: Yes. An enemy that enters play directly engaged with a player has engaged that player.
