Ok, firstly I tried posting a direct image in here but the forum really seems to not want to let me ....

 

so if anyone knows why it would be great because this thread would be so much better with pictures

 

---------------------------------------------------------

 

I recently decided to start collecting Tolkien Hardbacks. I have a rather nice edition of LOTR which I will have to link the image,

 

grrr.... I cant even do that it appears ....

 

Anyways, I have that image I cannot post haha...

 

so... my idea for this thread was to show our favourite books of Tolkien, but if we cant post image (I guess its just me) then it seems rather pointless...

 

...show me how its done ! :DD

I think you can only download them from the net?

 

Here are the covers of my German version, drawn bei Heinz Edelmann. It was the first German edition and it looks kind of weird. The first one made me shiver when I was young.

oh, thanks, I didn't know the forum had changed the way you put images on :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

wow, I have to say those are unusual, but very striking covers!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I have the English first edition (first impression) of The Silmarillion. Managed to find a picture of it.

 

The Hobbit and LotR first editions are way out of my price range (I've seen The Hobbit 1st ed from 1937 sell for about £20 000 online) but The Silmarillion is all right. I'm very careful with it!

As far as Swedish editions go, I really like my dad's paperback editions from 1967. Here is The Fellowship of the Ring.

I have the English 50th anniversary edition of The Lord of the Rings, too. It's pretty heavy, though - I'm currently re-reading FotR, and got a pocket edition so I won't have to drag the entire trilogy around. But it's a very nice edition. I brought it to school to read once (at age 15 or so) and someone asked me "What's that, The Bible?"

That's a first edition? Had no idea - my family has that same edition. It's very nicely done, and satisfyingly hard-backed. Bit beaten up these days with so many readings by different people though. :/

It might be, if that's your cover, or it might be a re-print. It needs to say "First published in 1977", without any mentions of a new printing/impression or later year on the same page. Several later impressions kept the same cover, with sometimes very subtle colour differences. I read an article where pretty serious collectors were comparing each other's blue/purple cover nuances over various printings.

yes, I also have that version of Silmarillion ... a nice red inked map in the back.. but the cover is a bit beaten up, so I carefully took the map out and mounted and framed it, its going look quite cool when its put up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

there has been recently some really nice hb editions released, though, like an idiot I still cant manage to link things here... idiot Gandalf!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Pure hardcover leather. These books will last 100 years if looked after. Like all books of this class they are expensive...

When you are posting on the forum.. click the big button 10 to the right of the big B. It looks like... a picture frame.. go figure. A box will open and past in the link to the image.
 
You can get a image link easiest by right clicking and going "copy url" or the equivalent for your browser. Otherwise right click and save image then upload to a free image host like postimage and then copy the link that gives you/.

Found it... this is a decent set.. not even in the same league as the millennium set, but these are nice hardbacks that are a normal kind of quality for hardbacks.

I'll put two of Silmarillions editions I like more (though I have none of them). I like them mostly because of the cover image, cause they have parts of the story that always attract me and are important to the plot

My very first copies of Lord of the Rings were these chaps:

But I kinda went off Lord of the Rings and got rid of them. Then I got all movie-happy and went for the English-versions of those posted by Mndela above. I loaned out The Two Towers to someone, who managed to spill a bottle of water over it, and it just wasn't the same since, I a couple of years back I traded up for these fellas:

 

jrrtolkin_boxed_zpsa1afd907.jpg [http://i151.photobucket.com/albums/s130/spalanzani/jrrtolkin_boxed_zpsa1afd907.jpg]

 

All in all, I'm quite happy with my current choice. They are a bit of a tight squeeze in the box, so it doesn't lend itself well to "Oh, I'll just look that up in the appendix/index" situations, but they are a colourful bunch and I appreciate their visual appeal as well as being, well, Lord of the Rings!

 

That is, until I discovered this thread, and saw these excellent hardbacks posted by booored. Must resist, but they are so beautiful!

I have a paperback version of The Hobbit with Alan Lee's illustrations that I bought in Oxford last summer. I brought it to a SciFi convention in Malmö here in Sweden this spring and asked Sylvester McCoy (Radagast) to sign it. He was very nice and asked for my name, even though I had to help him with the Swedish spelling of it. I don't have it here or I would upload his signature, but here's the edition:

 

thehobbit.jpg [http://irfanahdi.files.wordpress.com/2010/07/thehobbit.jpg]

 

He also signed a Doctor Who photograph for my sister, and later held an awesome Q&A with the fans. I asked him about being in The Hobbit, and he confirmed that "Peter Jackson has always wanted to cover an actor in bird s***."
