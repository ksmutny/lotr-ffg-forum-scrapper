# [A card Question...](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47228-a-card-question/)

Yesterday some friends of mine and I were playing a three player game.  We had the Leadership, Lore and Tactics deck playing.

I was playing the Tactics deck and there was a card (I cannot remember the name) but it states for 1 resource that the Hero can declare himself as an attacker and resolve the attack immediately, but it says that it must be an eligible target. 

What does eligible mean, does it mean that it must be a target that is already engaged or does the card mean that the target can be a creature in the staging area?  We took it to mean that if a creature was in the staging area but was not engaged it was not an eligible target.  Are we correct in our thinking or wrong?

Thanks

The card is called Quick Strike.

Eligible generally means enemies that you are engaged with but some characters let you violate this rule. Ranged characters can attack enemies engaged with other players so you can attack those if you use Quick Strike on a Ranged character (Possible in your example because you have Legolas). Dunhere can attack enemies in the Staging Area so if you are playing a multisphere Spirit/Tactic deck you could use Quick Strike on Dunhere to attack enemies in the staging area (Not possible in your example because Quick Strike requires you to attack with a hero you control).

Ok thanks for answering that question.  That's how we played it, but no one had the Spirit deck and so Dunhere was not  in play for that round.  That is a nice combination though Quick Strike/Dunhere.

Thanks.
