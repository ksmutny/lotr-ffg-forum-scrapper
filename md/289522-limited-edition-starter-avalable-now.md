This may be an error on FFG's part, but if not; this is huge. The Limited Collector's Edition seems to be available for standard order.

Whoa. Did anyone see this coming? Is FFG really releasing this to the public as a product?

Hasn't the $99 Collector's Edition been available to public since it was released?

What I don't see is the Starter Kit available as a separate, cheaper product.

If it was, I had no idea. I had seen it on the product page until now.

I guess for some reason I thought the LES was going to be pre-order only. Huh. Thanks, though! Wow do I feel silly. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I think it was listed as preorder even when it had been released

I thought this post meant it was available without the digital game so my heart sank when I saw it still was the bundle

Thanks for the info though!

The "limited" in limited edition doesn't make much sense if it is available for long term. The only exclusivity is for them when we talk about retailing method ^^

Seeing it‘s still called limited Edition, maybe it just isn‘t sold out? FFG said they produced a limited amount, but nobody knows exactly how many or how many were sold, I guess. 

It isn‘t on the cheaper side either (exspecially for non american-buyers) and includes many goodies many people might not care about (digital game, paintings...) might explaining why copies are left.

That would explain why I thought the bundle was pre-order only.

Can this now be ordered through your LGS?  What stopped me from getting it was the buy it only direct from FFG

It's clear that they expected higher demand for the digital game. FFG needs to unbundle the starter set from this edition; otherwise, it's a wasted opportunity to drive interest in the LCG. Hopefully this will happen sometime after the digital game is released.

Maybe so, but I think that they just keep it in the stock as long as they have it and when the original limited edition is out... they may reprint the starter set using normal graphic instead of full art.
