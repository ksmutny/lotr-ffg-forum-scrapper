So I just finished playing Shadows of Mirkwood, caught the little bugger and then... Left to go to a dwarf mine? Theres a little bit of a story silence here, so I was thinking that it would be interesting if a future cycle included more storyline after the capture and interrogation of Gollum. This could lend nicely to us getting a Th-thra.. Legolas' dad hero and a Gollum hero.

What time period is the Mirkwood cycle and is there time spare before the events of Fellowship of the Ring for a mini storyline?

Well this cycle is in the period of Aragorn and Gandalf's search for Gollum...I need to check my LOTR appendices, but I think its around...hmm...several years anyways..plenty of time ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

What would the 6 packs be?

Don't think the cycles are meant to connect story wise.

It will happen to you again after you finished dwarrowdelf:

Poof! In the far west of ME, sailing to Gondor....enter story of HoN.

While a nice idea story wise, I think the developers & the general consensus here will want to explore new lands.

Would you not rather see a Eriador or Angmar/Ettemoors....maybe a Harad/Rhun cycle?

I think it would be cool eventually to see a cycle that returns to that area, but focuses on different aspects. It would be cool to bring in more love for the Beorning and Dale traits. Maybe even a Radagast hero?

I agree with Ian. For some reason I don't really feel like I've explored thoroughly Middle-earth, even though we've been to almost everywhere... But I still feel we should return to Mirkwood and that area, it still doesn't feel explored (and we've been there twice). I'd like to see less totally desolate forests and more towns of the Woodmen, the elven city, even though I don't know what could be going on but it should be possible to have more "good" places (civilized) in the game. Areas and sites like that should be more visited, the problem is that basically each scenario takes place in one place, like Caradhras, druadan forest, Osgiliath, etc We are not allowed much travel in the game (although it's for a pretty good reason, we're on a quest). But still I'd like to visit the good places more. Maybe to get some item, heal, or something like that. A mechanic such as that I would totally love, even though the hard-core high difficulty players would not like it, lol

I'd rather have a journey somewhere else. Visit our friendsies easterlings, southorns(at their homelands) or travel far into the seas of Umbar(imagine a sea battle quest, lol), or else.

The beauty of middle is that we can go to somewhere and not even see half of it in the 6 packs and deluxe pack....I mean, who really thought they got the feel of gondor? ...I mean, that isn't a criticism at the designers, the cycle was awesome, but my point is these places are so rich and Tolkien described them so much I think its ok to go somewhere twice, perhaps even necessary...

 

...having said that I really want to go to the wilder places that aren't directly interacted in LOTR...like in the online game :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

In saying this I fervorously believe this game will go on for 20 years at the least so we can go everywhere about 3 times. I've become a real fanatic.

I'm interested to go to other places for sure, I just like Gollum as a character and think a thematic way for us to get him would be cool. I'm in no rush to go back to Mirkwood but it'd be interesting.

But I won't. Not that I dislike the game or something like that, no. It's just there is plenty of it released and I've yet to try all the different stuff. Also, there is a lot of custom made quests. The replayability of the game is already enromous. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I've never really thought about the cycles being interconnected, but it doesn't really bother me that they're not. I just like the fact that we get to go off on so many excellent adventures! The chance to go into the north would be really good, or indeed to the east...

The road darkens soon (see what i did there?) and so we will be sneaking off into the east soon after that. I can't wait, hero Gollum here we come!

At least 4 years more, which means at least 4 more cycles!

Why? Because they seem to be releasing 1 saga box per year.

And we got 4 more to go, so I wouldn't worry too much yet.

Unless a meteor hits FFG HQ. 4 years is the assumed time, not the actual 'real world effected' time.

Yeah I've really fallen for this game hard and just adore it now. I would be pretty goddamn crushed if it ended. As long as the saga gets all the way to the end and we get 3 to 4 more full cycles and a few more sets of POD's I'll be happy. More than that would be epic but I suspect it may all end when the saga ends.

## 17 [PsychoRocka on May 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106418-cool-idea-for-the-next-cycle/?do=findComment&comment=1089797)

Haha I used to actually play Magic but I haven't touched it or bought cards from the last several sets since I got into this game. Also barely play any video games (other than House of the Dead:Overkill with my girlfriend! Lots of fun!!) since getting into this game, would much rather quest in middle earth with my two decks. Until they make some new badass Lord of the Rings game that is! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I believe that the game will last as long as FFG feels it is making enough money to justify development. From what they've said so far, it's selling quite well and there does seem to be a continual flow of new players. No one can really say how long that will last, but I'm hopeful! In my mind, Sagas are separate from the main game, and were basically an afterthought to the original concept, so the Sagas ending won't really have an impact on the lifespan of the game. Sales will.

 

Anyway, what do we think are all the possible expansion locations for the game? I imagine we'll hit them before revisiting any old ones.

well, I did a poll on where people want to go next (god, why do I always fall back on referring to my polls? it must seem like im obsessed with the things.. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]). ... and it seems harad was the favourite

 

but I think, we have...hmm, well,

 

-mordor

-harad

-rhun (though I doubt it, Tolkien didn't barely describe it)

-the northern lands (angmar etc...go the way LOTRO did)

-more dwarven lands ... iron mountains etc

- shire!!!! yeah baby!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

-esgaroth, lonely mountain

-forochel (any lotro gamers reading this? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

 

I really want to take the rangers into the northern lands....

> I really want to take the rangers into the northern lands....

More rangers is never a bad thing. They've got to be one of my favourite theme of characters.

Is there anything to do in the Shire? Make an insanely hard quest called Bilbos Tea Party, hardest quest in the game. Haha. Just to be totally backwards.

well we could protect the Shire from the shadow, and without a single hobbit knowing it. It was hinted in the books at one point that there was this unsang struggle of rangers to keep the Enemy out of the hobbit land borders. Though I cannot remember who exactly was saying that.

The whole Dunedain cause. I dunno why I totally forgot this. I was thinking of Hobbiton, rather than the Shire in full. More Dunedain allies and heroes, so yes please.

well we once discussed here also ..less 'questy' quests :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I mean, sort of like, less danger, and enemies are represented by different things other than evil creatures. if anyone has ever played online games, or video games, where you are in the shire, you will know what I mean...not for everyone I know, but the theme would be cool :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I'm definitely interested in quests along that line. There's a lot of LOTR lore that doesn't revolve around just combat and epic quests. Would be a nice change of pace.

I would especially like to see a sort of 'shire hunt' ... perhaps some hidden treasure of Bilbo's or something (ok, the timing is off I know, but it could be something different) ...or search for Golfimbuls head :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] enemies could be obstacles instead of creatures, with the odd wolf thrown in, also riddles, timing effects, and players can go head to head :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I like the head to head idea. It doesn't have to change the dynamic of the game just have a 'we won, but I won more' feel to it. Which would be in good fun of course.

So Bilbos tea party as a quest is a go then? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm kind of tempted to make a half joking custom quest. I'll have to see if my motivation stays after doing my essays or if this is just a form of procrastination.

I would definately prefer northern lands, but I'm not sure which ones, west or east of the minty mountains. West you get Arthedain and Rhudaur, the Shire also of course, and east you get Rhovanion, the Iron Hills, the Lonely Mountain and Laketown which admitedly we've seen in the saga before (and then we've been to the Shire already too, so who cares) theres also the Iron Hills, the Withered Heath which were said to be infested with Dragons. How cool would be to see Dragons? Well, maybe the dragons should only be the bosses but there could be many lesser drakes as normal enemies. That would be awesome. The western norther-lands are cool too, many of the new dunedain cards are pointing toward that being the next cycle.

As a LOTRO player i would like to see angmar next, with carn dum. That place has got drakes and dragons in the online game which would be cool. And these a load of spectral enemies too, and we havent had very many of them yet.

Then i would like forochel as well. That place looks great online, all icy plains and snowdrifts with a vast frozen sea. Some of the towns look good too with their big tented cities.

I've never played LOTRO but have heard nothing but awesome about it, so it would be really nice to see Angmar. Personally, I'm kinda hoping we go to the Shire now, though. Not entirely sure why, but it feels almost like we're moving in some vaguely anti-clockwise direction in locations for the cycles, so moving up from Isengard/Dunland, it kinda makes sense...! 

 

I'd not say I was particularly a Hobbit fan, of course, but kinda like rich's idea above of questy quests rather than endless killing stuff would perhaps fit in with that area. Not suggesting the biggest threat should be whether the cabbages turn out well this season, of course, but a long while ago the idea of spies around the Shire was mentioned, and the Saga box only seems to have scratched the surface of that. So yeah, Shire next! 

 

Maybe...
