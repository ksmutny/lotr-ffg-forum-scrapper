So I've compiled a list of all of the Lord of the Rings sets out there, and there's 43 currently in 6 cycles, not counting the nightmare decks or any of that stuff. Just interested in player cards for the sake of this thought. I'm in the game about 6 months now, and am having trouble finding a couple packs from Shadows of Mirkwood or Dwarrowdelf, and FFG is out on their store here. I'm told they're out of print from LGS.  Some of those cards seem a bit crucial to optimal deck construction. 

 

So the question is-- is there a rotation planned? I know this is much more of a casual game and we're talking one fellowship event a year + gencon for "competitive" play, but just wondering how hard I should pursue these older sets. The adventures are fun but missing some cards from Return to Mirkwood and Foundations of Stone especially seems to be tough.

They certainly haven't said anything about rotation, and I don't see any particular reason to expect it.  Not being competitive helps with that, and they haven't done anything truly breaking.  The card pool is also much smaller, because packs are only half player cards.  The full LCGs already have a very long rotation period, it would be glacial here.

 

If you look at the products page, FFG has the packs you mention as Awaiting Reprint.  So they're not gone, just scarce until the reprint happens.  In the mean time, there are always online options - I'm a big fan of supporting the LCG, but if they don't have it and can't get it, not much else to do.

You can see from the official announcement of rotation that LOTR was specifically excluded from rotation:

Yeah, you'll definitely want to pick up those packs, but don't overpay just to get them now.  Shadows of Mirkwood is on the boat, so should be in stores in a month or so.  Dwarrowdelf reprints will probably be available in the first half of 2016.

Thanks Teamjimby, that's helpful to know. Can wait for that. Hopefully can get in time for christmas :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I'm finding that Return to Mirkwood actually is hard to find even by online retailers at retail cost, interestingly enough.  You'd think there's Jackson Howards in there or something.

Dain Ironfoot is the lynchpin card of Dwarf decks and he's in that set. It also doesn't help that it's out of print at the moment.

I've been using Gloin instead of him.

There is not the need in a cooperative game. 

 

LOTR can manage just fine with the occasional erratum(a).
