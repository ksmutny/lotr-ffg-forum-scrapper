# [Still pay for ally if played with Sneak Attack?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46313-still-pay-for-ally-if-played-with-sneak-attack/)

If I play an ally during the combat phase using the event "Sneak Attack," do I still pay the ally's cost (with appropriate resource tokens) in addition to the 1 [leadership] token for the Sneak Attack event card?

Sneak Attack: "Put 1 ally card into play from your hand..." Does "Put into play" allow me to deploy the ally without paying its cost? As opposed to, "Play 1 ally from your hand"? Am I overanalyzing the grammar of the Sneak Attack card?

You put it into play from your hand.  you do not pay the cost.

You're not overanalyzing at all.  In fact, you've hit on a key grammar distinction (the difference between "play" and "put into play") that is common to all the FFG LCGs.
