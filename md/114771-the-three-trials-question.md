I have a simple question considering this quest.

 

The Guardians always engage the first player (in all 3 phase 2B). When you play this quest solo, should you consider them to engage you again every round, or do they stay engaged?

Stay engaged.  Unless they actually move from one state to another (between players, or between staging area and engagement), the passive text that causes them to engage the first player has no action to perform.
