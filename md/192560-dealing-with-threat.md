Basically, how do I do this? So far the only card I have that can lower threat is Gandalf, and that's not always going to work given that he costs five and wanders off at the end of the round. What other cards let me reduce threat?

In case you haven't been already, you can use Sneak Attack with Gandalf and get more uses out of him.  This is a very cost effective way to reduce your threat.

Another way is to use heroes that have low starting treat with one hero with higher treat, trying to have a starting treat that is around 25 or less. A starting treat of 29 or more can be dangerous, unless you can deal with a high treat.

Note: unlike the other cards posted by John Constantine, The Galadhrim's Greetings is in the Core set (I saw from one of your earlier posts, Hockeyzombie, that you're a new player and don't have much beyond the Core set at this point).

Well, from the core set, there is Gandalf that can reduce your threat, and also Secret paths and Radagast Cunning that can help you.
