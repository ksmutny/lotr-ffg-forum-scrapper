When Lorien Guide commits to a quest, we put 1 progress token on the current location.

 

If that location is completed by the addition of this token, does that location become discarded and the actual characters commited (including him) then place tokens on the Quest location (if they succeed in beating the Encounter decks threat level?

 

Many thanks in advance.

Yes, all location are discarded when they have enough token, whenever it happens, wherever they are.
