Just a quick question really - My West Road Traveller cards are marked #30 in this set, but are between #120 (Support of the Eagles) and #122 (Astonishing Steed) so I am guessing they really should be  #121. Anyone the same or is my set an odd one out?

Thanks!

Mine are too numbered 30.

It's probably going to be a general misprint then, thanks for letting me know!

Noticed it some days ago but I thought this was a mistake in the german version
