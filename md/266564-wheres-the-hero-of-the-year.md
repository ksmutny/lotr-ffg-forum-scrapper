I haven't seen it anywhere.

I was looking forward to this year's competition, but if it's going to happen, I think we'll have to have it here.

I opted not to host it since there were only four new heroes in 2017. (Folco would have released during the competition). I'm considering hosting it in a dwiss round format, similar to Seastan's quest championship, once the harad cycle is complete

I knew it was bad, but not that bad.  C'mon Asmodee...

Only 4?  We got 2 from the saga box.  Does that mean there were only 2 APs this year (not counting Folco)?

I think the 2 from the Saga box should bring the total up to 6. Reference:

Still a pretty disappointing realization, though.

Whoops, yeah, six heroes. Other users it's been up to 10
