ok i am 1 step away from winning cair andros for the first time.

i feel i know this but dont want to ruin my chance at victory by playing incorrectly

 

question- power of mordor. count the number of cards in the staging area and shuffle them into the deck etc.

 

there were, before drawing power of mordor no cards in the staging area...am i correct in assuming that power of mordor doesnt count? ie. it isnt in the staging area when its revealed?

thanks!

I'm almost sure it doesn't count. I haven't played that quest yet but normally it's only enemies, locations and eventually objective cards that IS in the staging area, isn't it? I mean al other cards have an effect which resolves and then discarded. Don't know if that helps anything at all :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

thanks. thats what i thought. it doesnt matter now as i realised i had messed up and made the victory useless....however i took the same deck and killed it right after so its ok ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

PS - so do treacheries not stay in the staging area until the end of the quest phase? i saw that in the rules book it says not (i think?), but for cards like

"cards in the staging area get +1 threat"....does that affect cards that come after it as well as already there?

Treacheries are like Events, they come into play but they do not stay. It´s just an effect that happens and then it´s discarded, so treacheries are not added to the SA. Now for your 2nd question i think it depends on the wording of the card. If it said " all enemies/locations currently in the SA get +1 threat" it doesn´t affect any cards that are revealed after, but if it said "all enemies/locations get +1 threat" then i think it would affect any cards that could be revealed after.

i see, thanks. i was playing the treacheries like you say...naturally putting them in discard without really thinking about it, not that it would make much difference in most cases, the above one of the exceptions of course

though it was certainly the next part that confused me....

your answer makes sense, thanks

I'm almost positive that the +1 only applies to all enemies/locations currently in the SA, regardless the wording you mentioned. As you said the events/treacheries are happening instantly and then discarded. I believer if the effect would apply to all new enemies/locations it would mention it directly.

EDIT: Yes, it will only effect the cards already in the SA. I just read the unofficial FAQ and the explanations there are either official rule explanations or the way the majority plays it. Mostly the first though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If they card say currently in the staging then  yes but if card just add +1 threat or something else so is applies for all encounter cards including which ones will be revealed or add later in quest phase.

 

there was explanation from Designers somewhere

i see. i suppose it makes sense because ffg purposely differentiate between 'currently' and 'generally' ......from what i can think there are really only a couple of cards where it makes a difference. one i can think of is 'treacherous fog'

i shall send a request just to be sure

thanks all
