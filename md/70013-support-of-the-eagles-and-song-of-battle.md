Can I attach Support of the Eagles to a none tactics Hero if that Hero has song of battle attached to him?

Song of Battle
Type: Attachment
Sphere: Neutral Cost: 1
Song.
Attach to a hero.
Attached hero gains a [Tactics] resource icon.

Support of the Eagles
Type: Attachment
Sphere: Tactics Cost: 3
Boon.
Attach to a [Tactics] hero.
Action: Exhaust Support of the Eagles to choose an Eagle ally. Until the end of the phase, attached hero adds that ally's [Attack] or [Defense] (choose 1) to its own.

Sorry if this has been asked before.

Good, I never understand why Support of the Eagles has Attach to a [Tactics] hero and A Burning Brand has Attach to a Lore character, notice without the [] around the sphere. I feared that there might be something fishy hidden here…
