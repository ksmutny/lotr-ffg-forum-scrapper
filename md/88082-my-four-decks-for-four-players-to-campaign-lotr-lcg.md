The decks look OK to me.

Since you are using the entire card pool, I think you will find a lot of the quests quite easy - they were designed to challenge players who had access to a much smaller card pool.

you add outlands deck? Don't need to worry......Just add more healing and counter spell in other decks. And win the game

i thinking about this Glaurung, we can need more healing cards to Journey To Rhosgobel. I don't think we can have problems with enemy - 
 
We can kills some enemys before they engage with players - Thalin, Expecting Mischief, Straight Shot, Forest Patrol, Faramir with Ranger Bow, and Legolas, Faramir, Bard with Great Yew Bow, or Hands Upon the Bow, traps.
 
 
When someone survive, and engage Gondorian Spearman, Beregond with Spear of the Citadel, or Goblin-cleave should kills the rest. 
 
If someone still alive - Faramir, Legolas, Bard, Hirluim have distans so should finish the  rest.
 
against locations we have Glorfindel with Asfaloth, 3x Northern Tracker and Thror's Key.
 
I afraid only The druadan Forest this is hell scenario for 4 players

I have one question - if I play a trap of the staging area, and the Thalin will be assigned to the questing, when show up  enemy with 1 HP, Thalina kill him before he falls into the trap, or  that the first enemy fall into the trap, then ability Thalin kill him and enemy with trap be discarded?

First Player's choice if the effects would be simultaneous.  So use Thalin ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Where are the Dwarves?

 

Hahaha, nah just kidding. These decks look pretty amazing to me. I honestly can't think of anything to add/remove... maybe book of eldacar in the tactics deck for some scenarios, but even that is superflous. Kudos to you for making these decks.

good idea Gizlivadi  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Book Of Eldacar I can "play" again Gondorian Discipline, Feint and Thicket of Spears. I replace Descendant of Thorondor x2 on Book Of Eldacar x2. Thx 

 

Thalin kill all 1 HP enemy.

Straight Shot kill enemy with defense 0.

Expecting Mischief can kill enemy with 2 HP

The alive enemy can fall into the trap, then Forst Patrol can finished him.

 

So when someone alive from staging area, and engage with us, he be very weakness (damaged), we must only finished him.

And we have lot Ranged and Sentinel characters.

 

We play before dwarfes, but we replace dwarfes deck  on Outlands deck.

I thinking about play this Campaign LOTR LCG with Fallen Heroes rules from Official Campaign Mode. 

## 10 [13thcaesar on August 10, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88082-my-four-decks-for-four-players-to-campaign-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=835902)

Silvan Tracker can heal Legolas and Mirlonde - 2 damage each turn.

Gondorian Discipline can cancel 2 damage from Boromir, Beregond, Prince Imrahil and Hirluin the Fair (with Steward of Gondor). 

 

Warden of Healing can heal 2 damage from rest Heroes.

 

I like idea Boromir with Horn of Gondor (its good theme) Gondor's Fire and Support of the Eagles - he can become great killer.

maybe I put in Outlands deck Denethor ally and Sword Of Morthlond - then he can have 7 willpower, 5 attack, 6 defense and 7 HP - its almost like next hero ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

## 12 [13thcaesar on September 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88082-my-four-decks-for-four-players-to-campaign-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=876961)

I'm going to take advantage of these decks in my campaign LOTR (based on my idea that once already presented at the forum in the "Campaign LOTR") - the main "cities" (Lorien, Rivendell, Minas Tirith, and already soon as Isengard), choice paths and the rule of the Fallen Heroes of the official campaign rules published by the FFG.
 
After the release of "The voice of Isengard" the opportunity to travel a bit to extend - in Rivendell will be possible to travel to Isengard, and Isengard to Minas Tirith. In the same way from Minas Tirith back to Rivendell by Isengard.
 
But in December arrives to  my country (Polish) so  I will have to wait a little before the test is for four people. Then write whether and how it worked in the game.

I want to put on the table where we will play a big map of Middle-earth, so as to show the other players where we currently are, which way we can continue to travel (select paths), where to go - so they feel they really are traveling Middle-earth and can plan your journey.

 

Of course, I let the background "soundtrack to the game" (with the selected tracks) to highlight climate;)

can be fun if, for example in the quest "Passage Through Mirkwood" players in the Travel phase will choose such an area "Necromancer's Pass" and then show them on the map that got close to Dol Guldur.

 

Of course while traveling through Moria I put on the table a map of Khazad-Dum ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I know that the Elves deck and the Outlanders deck is one weakness - when Elrond or Hirluim dies, these decks are useless. Therefore important for the owners of these decks, is that they must survived - so well would be put into the deck of the Elves - 2x Fortune or Fate.

 

In December we'll see how far our team arrives. and what route will choose ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I want to use during the game, this map:

And in Khazad-Dum this:

tell me where is located the final battle with the Balrog in AP "Shadow and Flame" - I think that the Shadow Cave, but I'm not sure?

I don't know, actually - would make sense, if it is the Great Southern Abyss that plays a part at the end (trying not to spoil for new players, but maybe I just did).

 

I haven't seen this version of the Middle-Earth map before! Mordor and Gondor certainly look bigger.

 

Nice decks, too. I use something similar to the Lore deck (Loragorn instead of Mirlonde) and my friends use the elf twins and a Leader/Tactics Gondor deck respectively, while my gf plays a tri-sphere dwarf deck (Gloin, Gimli, Bifur). Dain looks pretty badass, though.
