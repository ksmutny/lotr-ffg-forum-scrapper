Discarded cards goes to their owner discard pile. You gain control of the attachment, but he is still the owner.

good question .. what happens, if Alcaron's Scroll [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=2658] is discarded by the shadow effect of Pickpocket [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=2676]? Or does "his" mean attachments he controls, so Alcaron's Scroll cannot discarded by this effect?

Ah nice, the rules do say that cards are discarded into the discard pile of the original deck they came from. I played incorrectly thinking you controlled the attachment and it would then go in your discard pile which sucked if you got that card back and then didn't have the matching resources..

The FAQ 1.07 says you gain control of Objective cards once attached to you. So you would begin to discard it from Pickpocket's shadow.. however, I do not think Alcaron's Scroll can be discarded because of it's passive ability saying if unattached return it to the staging area and that would take place first preventing you from discarding it.

I believe in this instance that Alcaron´s Scroll would be unattached but go to the staging area instead of the encounter discard pile. Thematically you dropped the scroll and have to double back to get it again.

The shadow effect on Pickpocket (HoN) instructs the player to discard one of "his" attachments. Can the player discard an attachment that he has in his hand, that is not attached to a character? Seems to me that most encounter cards that have a discard effect are more specific (e.g., by specifying an "attachment you control," or an attachment that is attached to a particular hero/ally/character/defender).

 

Other encounter cards in the same set (HoN) target the player's hand (e.g., by having him discard one or all cards in his hand), so this has me wondering...

 

Or is this just a case of less than ideal wording?

I believe it's intended to mean "defending player discards an attachment he controls" and that it's just sloppy wording, but that's just speculation. I think when I was playing I didn't even notice the odd wording and just played it that way without thinking.

I believe "his" implies that you control it, which means it must be in play.

That's how I've been playing it, but I was just wondering if others had a different view on the matter.
