Greetings all,

Today marks the first anniversary of the Vision of the Palantir blog, and I just wanted to take some time thanking you all for the incredible support I have received. Not only have some members dedicated time to write their own articles on the blog, but I also couldn't have imagined a year ago that people would support the blog through a monthly payment via Patreon (https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7631819) [https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=7631819]. I am very grateful for all the positive feedback and the constructive criticism I have received on the articles and hope to entertain you all some more during the next year. https://visionofthepalantir.com/2019/01/20/first-year-anniversary/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2019/01/20/first-year-anniversary/]

In February and March, I will be rolling out new features to the blog, both for the general audience, and some Patreon exclusive content. I am also thinking about making another poll to see what the community has for feedback and what they like to see in the future. All that is coming soon. I am also brainstorming about exclusive loot ideas for this year, after such great response from the tokens.

I hope I can count on your support during the next year, and hope that the game will continue to inspire more articles. If you have ideas for community-based articles (like I did for several topics in the past https://visionofthepalantir.com/other/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/other/]) then feel free to comment them below. I will have a lot of time on my hands starting next month, so I might put those ideas on paper...errr screen.

Thanks again, and good luck with your games!
