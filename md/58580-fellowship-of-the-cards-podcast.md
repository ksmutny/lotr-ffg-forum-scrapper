 I didn't see this posted yet but has anyone checked out the Fellowship of the cards podcast? I just downloaded the first 9 episodes. I guess it's a podcast about this LCG. I'm not sure if there are any others. If you guys find any other lotr lcg podcasts I'd love to hear about them.

 There's also "Cardboard of the Rings" which is bi-weekly and up to 16 episodes. It's very much a roundtable type discussion about new cards, play experiences, etc.

 Awesome! I just added it to my feed and will start downloading those episodes also. Thanks for the heads up!

Not a problem!  Up until Episode 9 its just Brandon and Andrew running the show, but once that episode comes around Brian joins the cast.  Episode 10 is when I hop on board, and since then it has been the four of us.  Episode 17, which is a retrospective on the entire Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, will probably end up being available sometime tonight or early tomorrow morning, and we're very much looking forward to reviewing Khazad-dum in the near future!  Of course, I'm the only host that has yet to get his copy sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

Hey, guys, thanks for posting about the show! Just a project Kevin and I really enjoy doing and hopefully you enjoy listening to.

@booored, The episode of Cardboard of the Rings (16.5) that you are referring to was Mitch and Brian, not myself. Although it would be fun to join them for another of those playthrough episodes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Whether you're interest is gameplay, mechanics, lore or background, both shows have something different for every player so check them out!

Yes but only because I hate tootin' my own horn :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

But like I think you've said before, it's OK to announce that one has a horn.
