There are no useless cards, but there are that you have never played them..., and by this way they are useless if you think so, this is my list:

I think I've tried this one before, only in a at least 2 Leadership hero deck where resources arent important.  If you have a lot of enemies coming, sometimes it can work to just not quest, saving everyone for combat.

Here's an ally I've never used.  He could be handy in location management decks, but since he doesn't really belong to any "faction" I have never found a spot for him.  I do like the artwork a lot, though. (Hope his boots are waterproof...)

Beorning Beekeeper for the win.

 

1. Underdeveloped trait!

2. Expensive!!

3. Ridiculous art!!!

4. Special ability involves discarding!!!!  

5. Beekeeper!!!!!

 

Argh!!!!! This card is so bad!!!!

What? I agree on everything else, but the art in this card is good, if not pretty good. What else would you have imagined to be a Beorning beekeeper to be like?

I for one hope the beekeeper will become a staple once :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Although I can hardly imagine that happening...but I like the artwork and I love Honey and Bees, so I kinda like the thematic aspect of the card :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

What I like about this game is that FFG uses traits that have no home yet. Sure at the moment it can mean that certain cards are useless and it doesn't make much sense to use them now. But it also opens up future design space to develop new traits and archetypes.

 

One card I never bothered to use:

Not saying Beorning Beekeeper is a game-changer but I have not only played it but also used it to a very decent effect several times (though yes, I would say it was about 10% of the games). The card goes well with Thalin, obviously, and other direct damage, like Hail of Stones, Gondorian Spearman, Spear of the Citadel. Killing enemies by direct damage is very effective, not only it reduces (in some cases) the threat in the staging area but it get you rid of their attacking value and shadow effect, not to mention bypassing their defence. I do hope, however, that one day this card gets way better, I believe minor factions like Bardings or Beornings should have powerful cards, since it is easier to avoid power-creep problems due synergies.

 

I haven't really used any of the other cards mentioned. And loads of others, mostly Dwarf and Outlands.

Indeed this card isn't bad for solo players. There are those early scenarios in which you didn't want to proceed to the next stage, where Early Onward helps you to make zero progress without getting a penalty. It's also helpful when you want to face some tough enemies with all your forces. You can play Bofur for only one resource with that card. Also leadership usually has an overflow of resources, so this card is not too expensive.

Agreed, I meant no disrespect to the artist.  Given the source topic, I suppose this is the most fantastic way to represent the epic nature of beekeeping.

This guy works well in a Outlands deck to set cards up for the Outlands hunter, he works well in a leadership tactics deck that uses horn of Gondar as well. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes, I see. I heard so many bad things about Outlands that I never really dived into that archetype ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] But it's something I love about this game and card games in general: Almost any card has its uses, I wish had more time to explore different possibilities!

I've gone back and used Power in the Earth more recently. It can really help when you need to patiently clear out some locations in the staging area with Northern Tracker, but you really put it in because you want to make use if it more than anything else. Ever Onward and Keen-eyed Took are both great in some deck builds, like a more combat-focused deck or with the Prince, but man; they really piss off other players in multi.

 

That beekeeper card is just awful.

Gandalf Search:

 

ffg_gandalfs-search-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_gandalfs-search-core.jpg]

 

I have never played it, honestly. The better use i find is to draw only 1 card if you need: pay 1 resource to draw 1 card.

For other better use: you need lots of resources, and when you have lots of resources you have better options to play other better cards.

I agree with all the cards listed so far. As a new player that makes me feel a little more confident about my deck building. There have been a few times I've looked at some of those cards and thought, there has to be something I;m missing, but I guess not.

Agreed. Further reason this card will never see the light of day is the emergence of Hidden Cache where you also get to spend one resource to draw a card, but with the benefit that it's neutral sphere and if it gets discarded for some reason you get two resources for your trouble.

 

Gandalf's Search is one of my favorite art designs so I use it for my green FFG deck box display card.

I still use it just to draw one card. As I play now from the beginnig with only Core Set, it´s ok because there are not so many possibilities to draw cards (except exhausting heros/characters) at this time. So I pay 1 resource and take a card^^ Helped me a few times. However, I think later with the other cards it would be disapeare in the box too.

I also never used Gandalf's Search although it is not a bad card per se. I remember when I used to play MTG i quite liked these "Look at top X card" effects. But the resource management in this game - and especially the lore sphere -  makes this card difficult to play efficiently, although I just yesterday wished I could have scried the top X cards of my deck. But of course, I wouldn't have had the resources for it anyway ;-)

 

Maybe in a mono Lore deck this could help find you the "one" card you so desperately need...

 

Artwork by the way is awesome ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Just as a thought, Bilbo Baggins + Good Meal could be a way to ease the cost of Gandalf's Search.

Watchful Peace can be very useful for scenarios that have useful locations or a location that is very mild compared to everything else in the encounter deck. For example, in the scenario "Foundations of Stone" you could use Watchful Peace to put "Drowned Treasury" back on the encounter deck. Assuming you have enough questing power to deal with the location quickly, this is the best possible card to get from the encounter deck. For "Watcher in the Water" you could send a softball location like "Makeshift Passage" back to the encounter deck and guarantee yourself one less tentacle to fight next round

 

If you have any scrying ability (ex. Henemarth Riversong), you can use his ability in the action window after staging to see what's coming next and then if something is nasty you could then use Watchful Peace to send a just explored location back to the deck. This is particularly useful if you have locations without shadow effects.

 

Watchful Peace is one of those cards that really shines in specific scenarios while being totally useless in others.

Gandalf's Search will play a much bigger role in the upcoming Voice of Isengard set due to the nasty effects linked to hand size. Check out this article [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4512]. Gandalf's Search will help you get exactly the card you want without drawing too many cards and getting whacked by the encounter deck.

Well, that's the point I agree on. The idea to make a beekeeper ally is dumb. But that doesn't mean that because the idea is bad the art is "ridiculous", as you say. In fact I quite enjoy the colors and technique used in it, one of the few saving graces of the card.

Almost all the times you want to use Watchfull Peace, you have enemies that will attack, so it will be a shadow card. Better is Shadow of the Past, and it is neutral (the bad thing is that it costs 2 resources, instead 1), and you can return back just lost objectives you want (not only locations).

Other card:

 

ffg_beorns-hospitality-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_beorns-hospitality-core.jpg]

 

It is not useless, of course: heal all the damage! Wow!!! But... honestly: do you include it in any of your decks? When we played with only core, yes..., but now, your choice at the end is for other healer lore cards, like Warden of Healing...

M1223.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/M1223.png]

 

This is one I've never played. Only valid reason for existence seems to be to pop Descendant of Thorondor out of play for direct damage and re-use, but...it's just not worth it and there are other ways to do it. Would have been more useful if it had been ruled that this could rescue Vassal and Winged Guardian before they are discarded.

This is other:

 

ffg_to-the-eyrie-ajtr.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_to-the-eyrie-ajtr.jpg]

 

It is good, sure. But..., honestly, i have never played it: when you want to rescue a good important ally, you dont have this card in hand and ready one eagle, and 2 resources in a tactic hero.

Too expensive: 2 resources, even if you dont have to exhaust one eagle. The ally would be very very very important....

I totally agree with that. The card would have been better if you could move any character back to your hand that is leaving the game.

 

The only reason to play To the Erie seems to me that if you have Support of the Eagles attached to one of your heroes and you just lost the only Vasall of the Windlord in play and you need itd ATT value to destroy the enemy. That way you could use the Vasall as a meat chield and strike back with his additional ATT power.

 

It's probably more useful now that we have the battle and siege keywords. Vasall of the WIndlord and Winged Guardian are more important now because of this.

Has anyone never played this card?

 

ffg_out-of-sight-tld.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_out-of-sight-tld.jpg]

 

Maybe not. In secrecy there are lore and leadership good cards, but spirit: none.

It can be good in a hobbit deck, sure. But there is other card that is better:

 

ffg_hobbit-sense-eaad.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_hobbit-sense-eaad.jpg]

 

The only condition is you must get all the heores as a hobbit. If you do, this card is easier to play than Out of Sight. I have played it several times in the Black Riders quests and it is a very good card (and with friends with ranged characters, better). The cost is the same, but in a hobbit deck, uf!, you must reduce your threat (so you need combo cards to play out of sight), or only can play it in the first rounds (like a Resourceful -this card yes i have in the hobbit deck, and i make mulligan if it is not in the first hand).

In fact, i have never played Out of Sight. Instead, Hobbit-Sense always in my hobbit deck against Black Rider expansion.

Yes, but with hobbits, you cant kill too many enemies anyway with Out of Sight. Hobbit-Sense is good if your mate have ranged characters like Legolas, Bard, etc.

I think this card will make a comeback. The new set is all about elves with "come into play" effects. This card and born aloft will be able to bounce those cards back into your hand to play again to trigger their into play effects again. I foresee a come back of the eagle deck.. this time with added elves.

Because Stargazer and Gildor are such bad cards for stacking the player deck you need to use Galdalf's search?

Interesting thread.  Most cards mentioned are in the core set.  

 

Here's a fun idea, FFG:  Make a new Core Set for this game.  

 

Keep the cards that have stood the test of time, but replace the others with new cards or modified versions (renamed, not just edited) that would be more useful and more in line with the new game direction.  That way, new players would have the option of which Core Set to pick up (the old one could be discontinued).  And this could provide incentive for seasoned players to pick up a second Core Set.

 

Probably a bad idea, but it just sounds so intriguing.

And when someone already has two or three (or even more) core sets? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

> ...Keep the cards that have stood the test of time, but replace the others with new cards or modified versions (renamed, not just edited) that would be more useful and more in line with the new game direction...

 

Honestly, this is the easy way out.  The more challenging and better way to approach this issue is to build new mechanics and design new cards that bring new life to seemingly useless cards.

 

Dark Knowledge and Small Target are a very specific example of this.

However 'Gondor Synergy' as a concept has caused me to play Guard of the Citadel more often.  Where as prior, I would simply look past him.

People give KET a lot of grief (and rightfully so ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) but with the Black Riders expansion came several cards that work with him.  It's not a slam dunk, but if you've filled your deck with daggers, cloaks, boots, determination, ponies, and hitches... KET can actually do *something*.

Check out this article [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4512]. Gandalf's Search will help you get exactly the card you want without drawing too many cards and getting whacked by the encounter deck.

First of all, Stargazer is spirit sphere so if you're running mono-lore that's not an option. But even if you are using Stargazer and Gildor, Gandalf's search will still be useful. Card draw is by far one of the most powerful effects in this game but most of the newer card draw effects are pulling multiple cards out of your deck (ex. 3 from Mithrandir's advice if you are playing with 3 lore heroes). In the new scenarios with the Dunlendings, you really don't want to draw lots of cards, you only need that one key card to solve the issue at hand. So you use Stargazer to set it up for you and Gandalf's search to pull it out of the deck. If you don't have Stargazer, you can use Gandalf's Search to dig a little deeper to find what you need. Gildor is definitely a good choice for the Dunlending problem and I'll definitely be putting him in my decks, but he's a cost 5 unique which means he won't be hitting the table until at least turn 3, maybe later. Gandalf's Search could be used for card draw on turn one.

 

I'm not saying Gandalf's Search is now some sort of super card, I'm just saying that the new mechanics that severely punish having lots of cards in hand will elevate Gandalf's Search above coaster status and make it playable again. Until, of course, this cycle is over and then it'll be back to coaster status again.

Yes, if I'm trying to use a monospirit deck in any quest that has a lot of siege questing. Cair Andros springs to mind. This card can be life saver as I find siege questing to be the most difficult part of the AtS cycle.

 

It's a niche card. When you need it, you really really need it, but outside of those decks and those scenarios, the card is not a good choice.
