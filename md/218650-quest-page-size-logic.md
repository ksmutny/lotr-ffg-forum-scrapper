Are they 8.5" x 11"?

 

Honestly I've been playing this game since the beginning and this has never come up.

They're standard US letter size, which means they won't fit in an A4 wallet unfortunately. And I've searched in the UK, can't seem to find them anywhere.

Ouch. Yeah, might give them a miss. Thank you though. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I've got all mine in a cardboard-backed envelope that some binder pages for my cards came in.That'll do for the time being.

They are indeed 8 1/2" x 11". I bought a large pack of 100 page sleeves, and keep all my quest pages in a binder. I had to cut the two-page ones down the middle crease to make them fit, but all in all, a very nice setup!
