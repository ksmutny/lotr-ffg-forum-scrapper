# [% of Heroes Played](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179491-of-heroes-played/)

Data nerd alert: I have a an excel spreadsheet where I type in stats after a round. Takes a minute at most, but can be interesting. I figure playing with Excel on some downtime at work can count as work/learning-for-work even if it is LOTR based, too.

 

These are the heroes I have and the percents I've played them.

 

Solo play: 54 games

 

Hero Times Used Percent Aragorn 6 11% Beravor 12 22% Bilbo 4 7% Boromir 0 0% Brand 0 0% Denethor 6 11% Dunhere 14 26% Eleanor 13 24% Eowyn 34 63% Gimli 2 4% Gloin 3 6% Glorfindel 10 19% Imrahil 1 2% Legolas 16 30% Thalin 11 20% Theodred 25 46%

 

Two-handed games: 20

 

Hero Times Used Percent Aragorn 4 20% Beravor 19 95% Bilbo 5 25% Boromir 0 0% Brand 0 0% Denethor 10 50% Dunhere 5 25% Eleanor 10 50% Eowyn 19 95% Gimli 0 0% Gloin 1 5% Glorfindel 4 20% Imrahil 1 5% Legolas 19 95% Thalin 4 20% Theodred 17 85%

 

I just got Boromir, so I haven't built a deck to use him yet. There are some clear trends in the data. Since I mainly have early stuff, I've been fiddling with a Rohan themed deck (Since Theodred and Eowyn are awesome....then I flip back and forth between going theme with Dunhere and Treachery safety valve with Eleanor)

 

The challenge: I want to try and build a solo or a pair of two-handed decks that uses the most heroes I play the least and stays viable. I figure there are combinations out there I would never think of my self.

 

Does anyone have any suggestions of sets of heroes to try?

I use the quest log of this web. I log the best score for each scenario in each number player mode (1-4). Here there is a section with 'stadistics' and you can see the percentatge of each hero.

My top list is:

 

1 - Legolas 6,23%

2 - Sam 5,05

3 - Bifur 4,94

4 - Eowyn 4,62

5 - Imrahil 4,51

6 - Glorfindel 4,40

7 - Frodo 4,30

8 - Aragorn CORE 4,08

9 - Mirlonde 3,65

10 - Denethor 3,54

I also use the quest log, and I log all of my 2-player games at home, including losses.  Man, it's got some surprising data for me... Gimli is my number 2?!  I used to play him a lot in the Core/Mirkwood days, but I didn't imagine he'd be so high on the list.  And Bilbo is on there!  I probably haven't used Bilbo, Bombur, Ori, or Thalin in over a year.  

 

I guess it reflects that I play a lot less frequently these days, or also that I tend to play a deck once or twice, then build a new one, whereas I used to play the same deck repeatedly a great many times.   I'm kind of proud that Bombur is number three on my list!!

 

And I have two 2-way ties in 6th and 8th place!

 

1. lotr_legolas.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/lotr_legolas.jpg] Legolas 10.51%

2. lotr_gimli.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/lotr_gimli.jpg] Gimli 7.21%

3. hero-bombur.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/hero-bombur.jpg] Bombur 6.01%

4. hero-ori.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/hero-ori.jpg] Ori 5.86%

5. bilbo.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/bilbo.jpg] Bilbo 5.41%

6. hero-beregond.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/hero-beregond.jpg] Beregond 4.95%

6. glorfindel-foundations.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/glorfindel-foundations.jpg] Glorfindel 4.95%

8. lotr_thalin.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/lotr_thalin.jpg] Thalin 3.90%

8. hero-aragorn-watcher.jpg [http://tools.fantasyflightgames.com/media/lotrquestlog/images/hero-aragorn-watcher.jpg] Aragorn (Lore) 3.90%

Neat tool. I started clicking around after both of you mentioned it. It needs achievements like Steam! (the idea is extra funny since everything is self-reported...)

 

Looks like Eowyn, Legolas, and Theodred are at the top of most lists by the community weight. I've wanted to use Gimli more, but I always seem to sub in Legolas instead.

I only have the logs with hcore, because i overwrite the old log when i get a better score. So i don't have the problem with old heroes with a lot of quests logged.

 

Grandsleep: Bombur, Bilbo, Gimli, Beregond... curious top 10 ^^

The website keeps track of your best scores for you. Why do you overwrite them?

It is as i like. It seems the stadistics of my heroes is the stadistics of best heroes.

 

PD: for example, if i want Erkenbrand to log, he must win a game with better score than others. Bad heroes can do it. So to me... is good idea.

Why do you mention Beregond? In my opinion he's an extremely strong hero.

Beregond is the most dead hero in the lotr-lcg universe

Wait. What?

Beregond is great.

The end.

I also do it as Mndela. Top five:

Celeborn 18 %

Galadriel 16 %

Haldir of Lórien 12 %

Éowyn 10 %

Glorfindel (Spirit) 6 %

I kind of like the Silvans :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I kind of wish I logged all my games so I could look at my stats.  All I know is that my #1 most played hero is Pippin.

Never too late to start!

Everything before was pre-season. Once you start to log, it gets real!

From 52 heroes, my Beregond hero is in top 29. Not so bad. But far between top 10 heroes.

 

PD: only logging the top higscores you get stadistics about good heroes. If you log all games, it nothing says about good heroes... your top 1 is simply: the most hero played.
