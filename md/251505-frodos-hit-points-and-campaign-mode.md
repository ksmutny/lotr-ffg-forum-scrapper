If Frodo's life or hit points is reduced to zero, does he die in campaign mode, become a fallen hero meaning I have to start the entire campaign over?

If I've understood things right,  if Frodo dies you lose the scenario and have to restart. So unless I'm wrong on that,  it's impossible for Frodo to become a Fallen Hero.

That makes sense but technically it is not in the rules nor on his card. It is the One Ring that says if it is removed from play, players lose.  What I am confused about is that per the campaign rules if any hero dies, they become a fallen hero. So Frodo dies, he becomes a Fallen hero and can't be used. There are no other Ring Bearers so it is impossible to win.

If you lose the scenario,  fallen heroes don't get counted.

Oh well I must have totally missed that rule. That makes complete sense. Thanks!
