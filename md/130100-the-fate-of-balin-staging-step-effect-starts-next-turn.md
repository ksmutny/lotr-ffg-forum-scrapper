Sorry if this has been answered before, but The Fate of Balin quest card has a forced action on the staging step (of the Questing phase, I assume).

 

Since the staging step happens *before* the resolution of the quest phase (during which The Fate of Balin is revealed), does this mean that the first forced effect does not happen until the *next* turn?  Or does it happen during the current turn as well?

Yeah, if you clear stage 1 through typical questing, the Forced effect won't have an opportunity to trigger until the staging step of the following round.  You have already finished the staging step and are doing the Quest Resolution portion of the quest phase.
