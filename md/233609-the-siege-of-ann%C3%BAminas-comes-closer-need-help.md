In two weeks "The Siege of Annúminas" comes to my town. 

The spoiled Host of Angmar needs to be killed in this scenario.

Do you have any ideas how to attack this enemy in the staging area so we not need to optionally engage him?

Engaging him isn't so bad, just have lots of defense and/or have some quest progress ready to discard.

Dunhere with good weapons? 

EDIT: Just read your other thread. I didn't realize immunity also stopped Dunhere. I got nothing, then.

I played a sneak preview of this quest with developer Matt Newman and I was at the 2nd table of 3.  We had a full 12 players.  Matt was at the first table.  My table never got one of these enemies, which meant that Matt's table was killing them all every round they came out.  Don't know how they were handling it.

 

We still lost badly.

But The Siege of Annuminas is already available to retail?

Thank you

I think they were perfectly prepared.

Siege is not available yet, it was previewed at Gen Con and people will be able to get it at the upcoming Fellowship Events in November.  Then it should become available as a general print-on-demand release, probably in 2017.

I was at a playthrough where I was at the Stage E/F pairing and we just killed them as they came out.

Perhaps you wanna give me an insight how you manage this?

K .. als Caleb answered me .. the best (and perhaps only) way is to engage this enemy, block him and destroy him. In the staging area he can't be targeted.

Tactics Aragorn killed someone else, we dragged this monstrosity over and cut him to pieces.

Doesn't work, it's immune to player card effects.

If you put Steward on Hama in stage 1 and build him up with Gondorian Fire, he can then spend stage 2 quick-striking each Host of Angmar that pops up. This avoids having to defend them.

The setup card for epic play says, that the Host is discarded after it damages Annuminas... interesting. In which teams's encounter discard pile?
