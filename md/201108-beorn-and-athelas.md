Can you heal Beorn with Athelas since Athelas seems to target the damage like Dori?  Or does the text on Athelas that says "on a character" mean it is targeting and so the damage is not eligible to be healed.

 

Edit: Ignore this topic.  It's similar wording to Warden of Healing and I'm pretty sure they've said that doesn't work.
