Text: Play Ithilien Pit into the staging area unattached.

If unattached, attach Ithilien Pit to the next eligible enemy that enters the staging area.

Any character may chose attached enemy as the target on an attack.

 

 

------

Question: This means an enemy can be attacked more than once by a player with different characters?

interesting. i did not think of that. i just thought the design of the card was to let you target in staging area, but i am interested to see if your point is correct
