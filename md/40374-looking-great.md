I am a huge LotR fan.  Read the 4 most commonly known books as well as the Silmarillion.  I have alot of extra stuff, like LotR Risk, have played LortR Online, and countless other things.  I also like CCG or LCG and I am looking forward to actually playing a card game like that from the beginning.  My most recent 2 card games I have only gotten into the games after they started, but I have loved them both.  WoW TCG and Warhammer Invasion.  Loving the look of this one and can't wait.
