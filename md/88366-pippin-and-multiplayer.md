Pippin's (spirit) ability reads:

"If each hero you control has the Hobbit trait, Pippin gains: "Response: After an enemy engages you, raise your threat by 3 to return it to the staging area. Until the end of the round, that enemy cannot engage you."

 

Am I correct in reading that, in multiplayer, this ability will just dump all the enemies on players with higher threat than you?  I was hoping to combo Pippin with the new Faramir, but because Pippin says "cannot engage you" rather than "cannot engage any players," it looks like any enemy deflected by Pippin will just end up engaged with the next player to make an engagement check, if their threat is too high.  

 

Do you all read this the same way?

Yes, i think the same.

 

So it´s maybe the worst ability of all heroes (excluding Hirluin).

At least his threat and willpower is good (much more than Bilbo)...so I will use him sometimes also outside of hobbit-decks.

Pippin is the worst hero of all. The only time I saw him in neburs deck, he died. Of course.

 

Threat and Willpower is good though, but one dark & dreadful and dead :-(

 

ah nebur, da komm ich auf die Idee mal nen Threat zu starten allá wer ist der schlechteste Held. Ich bin gespannt.
