Anyone has any idea about the Hero in the next AP?

 

I understand this seems a little 'rushing in' since Lost in the Dark just hit the shelves, but I thought maybe someone at GenCon heard something and whatnot.

 

I'm keeping my hopes for a Silvan/Noldor Hero, either Tactics or Lore (to abuse Rivendell Bow and Mirkwood Runner), but I don't know if there is any known Silvan character yet to appear (I doubt Thranduil will appear anyway) - maybe Rich could enlighten us here? Noldor would be ok too.
There is also always the possibility that they create a Hero (like Thalin, Beravor or Eleanor).

 

Anyway, thanks for any info!

If you are going by the numbers, then Spirit is "due" the hero (Spirit currently has just 5 compared to 6/7 for the other spheres).

The only other named Silvan characters I can think of from the book are Rumil and Orophin (they hang out with Haldir in Lorien). They are very minor characters, but then so is Dunhere.

There is also Argalad from Middle-Earth Quest who I expect we will see at some point, since we have already had Beravor, Eleanor and Thalin from this other game.

As far as possible elf heroes goes, one possibility is Argalad who is a elf character created, along with Thalin, Beravor and Eleanor, for Middle Earth Quest. I'm hoping to see him soon as a Silvan hero for Lore

Not that it bothers me personally, but I am so surprised Tolkien Enterprise allows for such extra characters to be created!  As I understand it, it is hard for anyone to gain the rights to tamper with the original story…I hear Christopher Tolkien can be a bit overprotective of his father's stuff! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

And you'd have to work for a living! (Meaning LotR is a gravy train.) You'd let people tamper with it because they make you $$.

nice detour discussion here…

… the shame is how cheaply the rights were sold for some greedy bastards now making tons of million from it

 I used to have a hope that we would see Arwen as a Spirit hero in this cycle.  I still do that we will someday.  On the other hand I love seeing her pop up when I'm drawing cards.  She's crazy good at 2 cost.

 

(And I think we'll see the other MEQ heroes someday too.)

i know this is all in jest, but i seriously do mean what i said…..christopher tolkien has (had?) a big responsibilty with controlling the rights to the best peice of fantasy literature of all time (ok so thats 'my' opinion, but im sure most here would go far different) and i think its important that the heritage of tolkien is well looked after…..now im not a huge fan of the films (as adaptions that is) as many here will know….so to sum up….i would take that briefcase, and insert it where even  the beauty of galadriel dont' shine :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

That Tolkien's work is the best of the (universally known) fantasy literature is one of the least arguable points ever made on these boards. Haha.

 I assume everyone has seen the update now. No new hero, but an interesting new ally. But I can't help but notice the irony that her ability to foretell the future (your cards) comes from her ability to read the stars -- an ability that is severely hindered by being underground at the roots of a mountain -- and yet she is an ally for the Foundations of Stone AP. I'm not complaining, and would still use her in that quest. It's just sort of funny to me.

## 14 [richsabre on May 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64869-foundations-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=634079)

being an astrophysics student i would have alot to say about her 'stargazing techniques' haha……but we live in fantasy so i guess all goes…..pretty artwork…

anyone notice the new mount…….

Reminds me a little of Bombur showing up in Road to Rivendell, except the Stargazer's utility isn't affected by the accompanying scenario.

"[…] Taking Initiative (The Redhorn Gate, 2), which has great potential in a deck that plays more attachments and events and fewer characters. Two draw and two damage for zero cost is a tremendous bargain, but the risk that you might discard a valuable card, and for no effect, has steered players away from it."

 

Wow, this… I'm stunned by that comment! Isn't people using Taking Initiative?
I use three in my Théodred/Bifur Secrecy deck and I rarely resent from using it.

 

Do other people steer away from Taking Initiative as the post suggests? 

 

Also, I didn't like her that much. She doesn't help you win the game directly, and I rarely am in a position where I NEED a card so much that I don't like what I draw. Also… what mount could that be?

## 17 [richsabre on May 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64869-foundations-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=634116)

mount could be asfaloth? shadow fax? bill? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

## 18 [hildargo on May 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64869-foundations-of-stone/?do=findComment&comment=634121)

Bill would be cool as a Hobbit only Mount. I am assuming that this will work much like an attachment, but with HP. Maybe give Hobbits a progress token or willpower boost. It would make Bilbo or Frodo that much more fun to play.

She's able to see the Higg's Boson…

Anyone else think the new ally looks like scalet johansson?  I don't think she'll get much use in any of my decks, but I am really interested in what the mount will be and how it works.

Holy moses! Wasn't for the chin, she would be called Imladris Johansson. partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif]
Good catch, I didn't realized first time.
