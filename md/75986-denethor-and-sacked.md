In Conflict at the Carrock, Sacked cards cannot be 'cancelled'. But does that mean you can't use Denethor's ability to look at the top card and move it to the bottom of the encounter deck?? The word 'cancel' is not in the card text for Denethor (unlike Eleanor). So is this legit?

Thanks for your advice.

Denethor's ability can be used to put a Sacked! card at the bottom of the encounter deck because his ability is not a "cancel" ability.
