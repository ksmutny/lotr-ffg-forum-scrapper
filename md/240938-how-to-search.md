I'm probably not posting this in the right section of this forum but I have been having a lot of difficulty searching the forum since the change over to the new service on Tuesday morning.  For example, a search of the Rules Questions & Answers section for 'Gandalf' or 'Sneak Attack' use to return dozens of posted threads and now turns up nothing - is anyone else experiencing difficulty searching?  Or maybe I am just not doing it properly?   Thanks...

A cursory investigation suggests teh search will only return pages that have been created or changed(?) since the changeover, but searching does seem to work fine wrt those pages.
