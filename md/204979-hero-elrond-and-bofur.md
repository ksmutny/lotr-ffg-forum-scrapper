A rookie question:  Can Elrond's resources be used to pay for Bofur's Quest Action:  "Spend one spirit resource to put Bofur into play from your hand, exhausted and committed to the quest."?

You are not paying for the ally in this case, you are just paying the cost of an action, so Elrond would be unable to supply the spirit resource.

Thank you, Seastan.  I have enjoyed your contributions to the community -- heard you on the COTR podcast the other day.  Thanks again.
