So I havent heard this discussed too much, but is this card amazing in a Gondor Deck?

 

Action:  Pay 1 resource to Draw 1 card

 

Can I pay 10 and draw 10?  Gondor is usually overflowing with resources, and needs Card Draw badly when running Mono-Leadership.

No, you can only buy one card for one resource. As the card text says.

I believe there are not limits of the amount of times you can use actions unless otherwise stated:

 

 
Longbeard Map-Maker [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/51223bd0-ffd1-11df-a976-0801202c9014] (Conflict at the Carrock)

Dwarf.   

Action: Spend 1 Lore resource to give Longbeard Map-Maker +1 Willpower until the end of the phase.

 

I dont see a limit, so paying 3 can give him +3 WP

 
Zigil Mineshaft [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/51223bd0-ffd1-11df-a976-0801207c9089] (Khazad-dûm)
Quest Points5 threat.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/threat.png]5
Underground.   Dark.   

Action: Raise each player's threat by 1 to place 1 progress token on Zigil Mineshaft.

 

Pretty sure you can raise your threat by 5 to place 5 progress tokens

Protector Lorien also you can use the action several times:

But these cards are not event. When the card is event, can you use several times the same action?

This is correct, the reason that it can not be used multiple times is that it is a one time event.

Yea seems to be the first card like this, would be nice to get a clarification, but I'll play as you guys say

If you were able to pay more, the card would read "Pay X resources to draw X cards."  As it is, you have to discard it immediately upon triggering the action 1 time, so there's no chance to trigger it more than once.

## 8 [Mndela on December 10, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94949-hidden-cache/?do=findComment&comment=927474)

In fact, i have just notice now, lots of events would be powerful if you can repeat the action the times you want.

## 9 [leptokurt on December 10, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94949-hidden-cache/?do=findComment&comment=927554)

Yep, it's an event and can thus only be used once. Like this card here:

By the way.... what card are we even talking about?  Campfire Tales?

I've used Hidden Cache to great effect in a mono-Spirit Caldara deck that I built. The deck is basically built around discarding your deck using Emery and Zigil Miner, and Hidden Cache fits really well into that strategy. Even outside of that deck, it combos well with A Very Good Tale and Ered Nimrais Prospector.

Oh.. DUH!  Hidden Cache.  Read the topic, grandspleen.

## 13 [Spurries on December 11, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94949-hidden-cache/?do=findComment&comment=928100)

Cool, confirmed, thanks all, I guess I was just used to being able to pay multiple resources in Actions.  That card woulda been amazing if so, now its still worth including in a Gondor deck, especially if you include A Very Good Tale.

I love the idea behind the discard mechanics.  I'd like to see some more cards with similar effects...  Maybe even an effect when discarding from your hand?

Gildor

If you have Hidden Cache in hand, you can use Gildor to prepare it to discard from your deck by other effect card.

I absolutely love Hidden Cache. I've been using it in combo with Expert Treasure Hunter.

> I love the idea behind the discard mechanics.  I'd like to see some more cards with similar effects...  Maybe even an effect when discarding from your hand?

I would be willing to bet that you will get your wish with at least one or two of the new player cards coming in the Voice of Isengard expansion since discarding cards is going to be a new play style in order to combat the wild men of Dunland.
