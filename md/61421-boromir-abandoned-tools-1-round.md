In Flight from Moria, if Boromir has the Abandoned Tools during Search for an Exit - Escape from Darkness quest, can’t I use his ability Action: Raise your threat by 1 to ready Boromir to use the Abandoned Tools 4 times during Refresh Action? Sorry if this has been asked before.

Abandoned Tools
Type: Objective
Encounter Set: Flight from Moria
Tools.
Guarded. Restricted.
Action: Exhaust a her to claim this objective if it has no encounters attached. Then, attach Abandoned Tools to that hero. (If detached, return Abandoned Tools to the staging area.)
 

Search for an Exit - Escape from Darkness
Type: Quest
Quest Points: 4
While Search for an exit is the active quest card, only flip it to side 2B at the beginning of the staging step.

Abandoned Tools gains: "Refresh Action: Exhaust attached hero to put a progress token on Escape from Darkness."

Players may bypass this quest card at the end of the combat phase.
Progress tokens cannot be placed on Escape from Darkness except by Abandoned Tools. If the players defeat this stage, they escape and win the game.
