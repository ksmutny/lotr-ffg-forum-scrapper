According to one site, just 38 more days till Dunland Trap is released...

Here's hoping...

 

 

 

Or better yet, 8 more days, according to UK Amazon...

Well it is at the printer now... but I still think it's probably a good 2 months away. But!! We'll likely get a few of those AP's released quickly back to back after the long wait!

Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

Finally some good info today...

There's still a month left sadly.

I can hardly believe this is happening again. Early Q2 for Dunland Trap? I had a vague idea that Q2 runs from April to June, but certainly not in ffg's calendar.

Well May is still in Q2, so what's the problem?

The original release dates much like the quest difficulty ratings should probably be taken with a grain of salt

Are you seriously calling the end of May early Q2? That may be one problem there...

Of course. And I do. It just gets boring when the delay happens just about every freaking time.

The end of may would be mid-Q2 :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, I thought it was quite simple actually: April - early Q2, May - just Q2, June - late Q2

As for now, the Three Trials and the Road Darkens are still listed as Q2, but I don't really hold my breath.

I feel like we're due for another article on the road darkens any day now. They always have a detailed overview of the quests themselves

Yes! It's due for this week.

That'd be cool, especially if they spoilt the hero...

I hope they don't spoil the hero before the box releases.

Though I love the spoilers, it's really too big a spoiler when they show the hero, imo.

They should spoil only 1 hero per cycle, as it keeps the anticipation for the rest of the packs up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Curse you and your hopes!

Careful with throwing curses around little troll boy.

You just might catch something.

I'd rather catch something than sit in darkness without knowing what's coming.

How's the curse, btw?

This has gone unexpectedly warm...

All good. I used A Test Of Will to cancel the effect. It was empty, like your head & all your talk here, but I did so just in case.

But why do you ask? Are you concerned all of a sudden?

And you didn't answer my last question, so I'll ask again: would you? Really?

You think so eh.

Then I'm officially trolling the troll now. Nice!

But since you seem to be unable to answer a question a asked you twice, I kinda got the idea that you are not just a bit retarded.

Let's see if you really can't answer a question: are you retarded?

And it is getting better still. Too bad I might be the only one watching...

I want to enjoy the stupidity of it, but I just don't know how all this sh*t started so I can't even make sense of it.

Wrong. You know nothing Jon trololo.

I'm not offended at all. I just got tired of your pissy replies to everyone on every thread.

And I know others are too. Retard.

Or maybe that's your sense of humor as you put it?

Word of advice: keep it to yourself. You're not funny.

*sigh*

 

As opposed to someone who goes that extra mile to prove that he is not affected and doesn´t care what other people say or think.

On a lighter note...

 

442 days until The Hobbit: There and Back Again is released in the U.S.

 

Woo Hoo!

It's no longer called "There and Back Again", but rather "The Battle of the Five Armies" and it is to be released in 2014.  (Which makes it less than 442 days.)
