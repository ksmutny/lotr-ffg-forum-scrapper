Hey friends, 

 

Do you have any recommendation for printservices for custom cards, dividers, card boxes, or playmat? 

Its nice to see all the fancy us free domestic shipping deals, but the +30 +50 +100 bucks for the shipping makes it usually not worth it.  

 

Germany, Poland, Austria something around here?

I used inkedgaming (inked playmats) for a two player sized playmat shipped to uk.

Yes the shipping wasn't cheap but packaging was great and product outstanding!

I would buy again from them to internationally ship.

I am interested also (for cards, I want to print First age) , though with the financial capital controls we still have in Greece I do not have the possibility at the moment

I'm from Germany and my playmat was printed at a local print office. Saved the image on a CD, brought it to that office, that's it. Very easy and good. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
