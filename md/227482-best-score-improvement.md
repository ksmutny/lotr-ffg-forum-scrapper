Hey guys, my partner and I just beat Emyn Muil last night (2nd attempt) and were contemplating afterward how we could finish it faster and with a better score, because really, the thing that dragged our score down was the 8 rounds, as we had both used means to lower our threats significantly before the victory. We finished with a score of 124.

 

Just wondering what your best score improvements were from one attempt at a quest to another. The first time we did quests like Journey Down the Anduin, and Conflict at the Carrock, we had pretty high scores but were able to drop them the second or third time.

 

Our best improvement so far was from 171 to 124 on Journey Down the Anduin. Got any best score improvements and if you can remember, how you changed things up to get a lower score?
