First of all let me start by saying 'hello' to all the forum readers as this is my first post here and let me say that I am a gamer from Poland so please excuse many mistakes that I will make in my posts.

My (analog) gaming background:
- Gamed a lot in my childhood (Chess, Checkers, Polish Monopoly clones, Talisman, Fury of Dracula etc.) mainly with my brother
- Had a long brake in table top gaming as I went to high school and to collage/university
- Got back into it while staying in the Netherlands (mostly eurogames but also A Game of Thrones, Warrior Knights)
- I came back to Poland and expanded my collection, started my own gaming group (which is still meeting bi-weakly and is highly competitive)

My LOTR:LCG experiences and collection:
- Played LOTR: LCG with a friend at the end of 2011 and was intrigued
- In May 2012 got my own core set and played it  50 times already. Later I traded for the second core set and two expansions. 
- In June 2012 I bought (again second hand) the rest of Mirkwood cycle and Massing at Osgiliath
- In September 2012 I got Khazad-Dum expansion (second hand)
- In October 2012 I got first 3 APs from the second cycle (new)

About the 100 play challenge:
I saw a geeklist on BGG (http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/142757/the-100-play-challenge-in-support-of-deeper-explor [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/142757/the-100-play-challenge-in-support-of-deeper-explor]) that asked for players to pledge to play a game 100 times and write down thoughts/comments about each play and the chosen game in general. I decided to join the fun with LOTR:LCG as my game of choice.

I am fully aware that many people here played this many more than 100 times but I think that it might still be interesting to read (semi-)thoughtful comments from a beginner like me.

Throughout my plays I will try to answer the following questions:
- How the increased pool of cards changes the game experience?
- Is it necessary to buy more stuff in order to enjoy the game for a longer time? - ANSWER: No!
- Are the new scenarios bringing something really new to the game experience?

It is also interesting how some new questions (about strategy and tactics) appear as I am making progress on the challenge and how will my view of the game change after completing it. For now I expect my plays to continue beyond 100 and I also expect occasional 2 (and more) player games. I will post my thought here as well as they might be more interesting for readers here then for general BGG reader.

Now that the original challenge of playing the game 100 times and commenting them is completed I decided to count all plays here. Will update it irregularly:
Plays: 196

What: Second scenario. Solo play with Lore/Leadership deck. WIN!
-----------------------------------------
[Local] This time I decided not to play tournament legal deck an instead went for constructed 30 card deck. It was actually quite difficult to reduce the number of the cards to 30. The game went for a long time (23 turns) which yielded a pretty bad score of 259. Two times I was almost put to stop by the encounter deck - I was saved by mine own deck (which was depleted round before the end) each time pulling the right/powerful card. I ended up with tone of resources on my heroes - this means that the deck was not optimal - I could have included more powerful and costly allies
--------------------------------------
[General] While playing only with cards from the core set one is extremely limited in deck construction part of the game if using two sphere tournament deck of 50 cards. Almost all available cards need to be used which means that quite a few of not so good cards will end up in your hand throughout the quest. Since in this game most of the time the encounter deck will pound on you very hard every card needs to work to its highest potential and those not so good cards will be your undoing.
-------------------------------
Note to all people playing with only one core set: Use 30 (35?) card constructed decks in order to increase your enjoyment of the game.

Note to self: try to use three sphere deck - my gut feeling is that resource generation will be major problem. I do not see it working with cards from CS.

Tried the second scenario again (with Lore/Leadership deck). Lost all 4 attempts - but almost won the last one.
-----------------------------------------
[Local]This time I went with four most threat costly heroes to see how it works in such configuration. I also updated the deck since yesterday's play and I think it was even stronger now. Nevertheless high starting threat is a terrible idea in this scenario as you don't get any time to field your alies before the troll starts swinging at you. In such case even heroes with formidable stats do not stand the chance (I killed the troll 3 out 4 times but heroes were so damaged and without any support that the river easily eliminated me). When I was already convinced that for this (any?) scenario you need at least two or 3 rounds before engaging the troll the last try was almost successful. I arrived at the last part of the quest only with one weak enemy in the staging area. But then the events together with two surges killed all allies and wounded heroes.
-----------------------------------------
[General] Threat is an excellent mechanic in this game introducing very hard and interesting choices. Do you go for better heros that will be able to do a lot of cool things latter … the trade off is that enemies will start pounding at you from the turn one and will most of the time overwhelm you by killing your allies and wounding heroes. Then you are so weakened that treacheries will slowly kill you off unless you are very lucky. On the other hand … if you choose only weak heroes you will have time to prepare but will lack the strength to take care of the stronger enemies. Of course it all depends on the scenario but as a general observation it seems to be correct.

Second scenario from CS. Leadership/Lore deck - win, 2xloss, win
---------------------------------------
[Local]This time I decided to go for three heroes with lowest threat to try the opposite strategy from the previous plays. Initially I used the same deck as before. The first win was just a shear luck (encounter deck was VERY merciful) and following two loses proved that I was not prepared to face the challenge. I almost jumped to conclusion that all "weak" heroes are as bad as three "strong" ones but I mad a small observation - heroes that I choose were generating resources really fast and I didn't have cards to spend them on. I re-tweaked the deck and achieved a victory and this time I am fairly confident that it was not just by accident (won despite the fact that encounter deck was attacking me a quite strong cards).
----------------------------------------
[General]You need to build your deck not only with a scenario in mind but also take into account the strengths and weakness of your chosen heroes. It is sometimes hard to see what those are just from the cards and you might need to play a game once or twice to see them.

"Weak" (low initial threat) heroes seem to be vulnerable to encounter deck streaks (constantly getting only enemies or only locations) as then without heavy hitters (fight or quest wise) is hard to contain the staging area.

 Welcome to the forums! This challenge sounds interesting and I look forward to reading more of your thoughts and impressions. I probably won't be able to do this challenge. With an average of 3 games per week, it'd take me about 33 weeks to finish it!

hi this seems very interesting- i wonder how long it will take….i believe after a year of obsessive playing i am on my 300+ game….

edit : never mind seen you have two core sets and waiting for 2 expansions

my answers to your initial 3 questions

1.the card pool changes this game alot….mainly it gets alot easier for the early scenarios (which would be expected)

2.defintaly not- but it certianly adds enjoyment to the game

3.yes they do - they each have their own theme and feel when playing

 Budgernaut - 3 times per week is a very good frequency. I am hoping to be able to settle around that once my initial fascination with the game will die out.

 
richsabre - Thanks for your answers. So far my gut feeling tells me that my answers will be similar to yours. As for my estimate how long it will take me to do the challenge … I hope to complete it by the end of the year. 
 
One observation for people that are 'late' to the game - you should be able to obtain it at a very decent price if you don't mind getting used:
I paid 80 PLN (which is around 20 USD) for the first core set and traded my used copy of Ghost Stories for another (used) core set and two adventure packs so it was quite reasonable so far. From now on I will need to buy things new though (unless I am extremely lucky) so it will not be that nice any more.

Third scenario from CS. Lore/Leadership deck - lost all of them
---------------------------------------
[Local]I attempted the third scenario (escape from Dol Guldur) again trying to apply what I have learned throughout my plays of Journey down the Anduin and was trounced by the scenario. It is very badly suited for solo play as you get 3 cards from the encounter deck right from the get go and only if you are very very lucky you have a chance to start to progress (if you start with two enemies or two locations then you are pretty much toasted). Once you get going (by clearing the staging area) then the things are looking better but … you soon discover that you are running out of cards. Then the Nazgul comes and eats you allies faster then you can field them (especially if supported by other enemies attacking you).
----------------------------------------
[General]This scenario should be in the core set despite the fact I think it is unbeatable with the cards from the base game (unless you will get 1-in-a-million lucky). It intrigues, it forces you to tweak your deck tons and tons of times. At the same time I understand why it lowers the value of the base game for many people. They will see it as unbeatable (solo) and claim that the game comes with only two playable scenario. I think that FFG would do much better by including fourth scenario with a difficulty close to Journey down Anduin.

I feel that I am nearing the point that I played core set enough. I can attempt the last scenario few more times and I have few deck ideas for Jounrey down the Anduin and I will be done with it. So say that reasonable amount of plays you can get is around 50. One remark to this estimate - if you can find the second player you could easily add another 25 or so plays to it.

In my opinion, there should have been something different done for Dol Guldur solo, like having 1 objective only, or not attaching encounters to the objectives, it would be hard enough still. As it is it is madness.

## 10 [player543086 on June 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65376-wojos-beyond100-plays-challenge-comments-update-the-redhorn-gate-conclusion/?do=findComment&comment=639954)

 I don't mind the harshness of the Escape scenario for the solo player - it really keeps you playing and trying all sorts of thighs. It definitely has its place in core set. Having said that I do think the setup should be less random (objects could be guarded by specified cards - say one location, one enemy and one treachery - of those none should have threat higher then 2). I also think (note: this total conjecture as I have not played it two player) that it is comparatively too easy with two players (although the restriction on playing only one ally will hurt two players much more then solo-ers).

In my mind this scenario is an ultimate finale to Mirkwood Cycle. Equipped with cards/heroes from all of its adventure packs you should be able to create decks that will have a reasonable chance beating it. With that … I do miss one more hard (a bit harder then Journey down the Anduin) but beatable scenario in the core set. I think this did hurt the game as people where discouraged from exploring it further and labeled it broken/too random based on their experience with the Escape …

i actually dont think there is a 'in between' anduin and dol guldur yet in the mirkwood cycle- i think into the pit (khazad dum difficulty 5) is probably the quest your looking for

Third scenario from CS. Lore/Leadership deck - lost
---------------------------------------
[Local] Since I had scenario ready to go I decided to try it one more time before diving into the second core set I received (see bellow). No new thoughts concerning Dul Guldur - it is (near)impossible with just the base cards.
----------------------------------------
[General] As mentioned above I got my second core set and I would like to share few random thoughts about it:

- I started with merging two sets into a "tournament playable" pool of cards 3 copies of player cards. With two CS I am missing around 12 player (3 or 4 per sphere) cards to complete it. It was nice to obtain more copies of some of my favorite cards (feint, sneak attack come to mind). I felt pretty good getting the game "again" at this point.

- I packed all of the surplus cards, tokens and rules in one of the boxes in order to store them at the bottom of my closet. When I was closing the lid on this second box I saw so many components that I will not get to use and to tell the truth felt disappointed that so many things will be pretty much useless.

- Then the newly constructed card pool went into a "transport" deck box (it should hold close to 200 sleeved cards) followed by encounter cards and tokens (with d10s replacing threat counters). To my great disappointment I discovered that there is no space left in the box. I realized that now my game will not be as portable as it used to be with a single core set and the adventure packs will make it even worse. I am afraid that this will impact amount of plays. I will be hesitant to carry a huge box of cards with me just in case I have some free time to play it (so far it yielded +10 plays so not bad at all).

To sum up I have mixed feelings about the second core set - on one hand I am glad that my card poll increased as it makes deck building more interesting. On the other hand I feel that there is a great waste of space, cards and value here. This solves the problem of the third core set - I will not be getting it.

Hunt for Gollum scenario. 5 wins and 1 loss. Leadership/Spirit deck (cards from two core sets but not from the AP).
--------------------------------------
[Local] I will not discuss the details of the scenario not to spoil it for others instead here are few random observations:
- Hunt for Gollum is an interesting scenario with a distinct flavor then the ones found in core set. Great addition to the game.
- This scenario seems to scale best from the ones that I tried. It will be equally hard for different number of players (note: this is based on my feel as I only tried it solo)
- I like the flow of the scenario it is paced extremely well.
--------------------------------------
[General]
- This time I discovered that at times it is hard to keep all the rules/effects straight (your own cards, staging area, quest cards) - this affects mostly solo players. Despite the fact I tried to concentrate on all those thighs I am sure missed one or two effects.

- I have not tried the players cards from Hunt for Gollum but based on the scenario alone I am recommending it to all players.

- Using cards from two core sets gives your ("tournament legal") deck a huge boost.

What: First scenario with cards from two core sets. Leadership/Spirit deck. 3 wins and 2 losses.

-----------------------------------------
[Local] Only one little observation here - despite its low difficulty you can lose this scenario if encounter deck throws enemies (or locations) at you constantly and you do not draw player cards (allies) to combat them.
---------------------------------------
[General] I went into this scenario just to show how powerful the deck built from two core sets and my first play got me a great score … but … I lost next to attempts. I went back into the deck drawing board and adjusted it for this particular challenge (I started with a deck designed for The Hunt for Gollum) and got more consistent (winning) results.

- Let me reiterate: you need to design your deck and choose heroes for a particular scenario. I do not expect one single deck to perform extremely well in all scenarios. I do think that it is possible to build a deck that will complete many scenarios but I would not expect it to beat the specialized decks as far as the scores goes.

- Two core sets give huge boost to your deck building options but just because you have three copies of most of the cards (and two of the rest) will not give you a guaranteed win even on easier scenarios. Optimal deck building is required for more consistent results.

Journey down the Anduin scenario with Spirit/Tactics deck 3 losses
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] I was trounced all three times despite the fact that I was able to go all the way to the third stage once or twice. Tactics is a really specialized sphere and as far as I can see it is to weak for this scenario. I am still willing to say taha luck of the draw or poor deck construction was the source of my fails but three tries with no success … it suggests that something is going on here (see bellow)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Global] When choosing heroes/spheres for playing you really need to choose ones that will help you reasonably well with several aspects of the game. The test above showed me that tactics is probably the weakest sphere in solo playing - it is solely oriented on fighting (if you disregard Legolas and Balde of Gondolin) and this is usually not enough to succeed (on regular basis) in more difficult quests. I am not ready to say that it useless in solo play but for now I am marking as the weakest or too specialized.

Journey Down the Anduin scenario with Spirit/Leadership deck 1 loss and two wins
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Nothing really new here. I failed the first time, re-tweeked my deck and was able to win two times in a row with similar score each time. One interesting observation bellow and here I will provide example: So far I considered Dwarven Tomb card a fairly weak card … what a mistake. It is very strong as virtually increases the number of times you can play the most useful cards in your deck - with the added beauty that you only need to decide what is mots useful at the right moment.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Global] Cards "on paper" might look weaker/stronger then they actually are in a particular deck. Need to try several cards that I consider bad/not worthed and see if they are actually that bad or am I not seeing their full potential.

Passasge through Mirkwood 2 player with my wife. Mono Spirit and Mono Tactics. Won
----------------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] My wife likes to play games with me but she is not a "gamer". I didn't have high hopes that she will like this game as she prefers economic games (euro) and she does not care about the theme so much. Add to this that she is not big on co-operative games and you get the picture. She was a good sport and gave the game a go. As far as rules go she was mostly ok but was very confused what is the difference between enemy attacking a player and a player attacking enemy. I might have chosen wrong scenario (she would enjoy the more challenging scenario more) but I went for a short one and I did not think that it would make much difference. Overal she did not like it much and was quite courious why I like it and we had a nice conversation about it (and games in general)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
[General] In general teaching rules to LOTR LCG is quite easy (as the rules are fairly straightforward) but of course the devil is in the details as there are plenty of rules on the cards them self and it can be quite hard to manage/understand them all at the same time. Now after teaching my wife the game I also understand why so many people were not impressed with this game as much as I am. Two points:
1. Without deck building you loose very fun strategic part of the game and you are left with a tactical game (that you might or might not enjoy enough to like the game as a whole)
2. If you play the game only to win each scenario once (instead of trying to build the deck that will beat it consistently) its life will be very limited

Finally used that card (2 copies) last night when I switched my deck up a bit…  was able to get it out early on Bervor (and then Theodred).  That solved any card-draw/resource issues I may have had… lol.  Don't know why I was so late "getting to the party" on using that gem…  It's almost tempting to pick up a third core set cheap somewhere to try and get a third… lol

Journey down the Anduin, Spirit/Leadership deck Win, 2xLoss, Win
----------------------------------
[Local] I wanted to add a third victory in a row to my previous plays so I went again against the good old JdtA quest. To tell the truth I was almost sure that I will loose as soon as I saw two trolls at the beginning. I decided to go ahead any way and was amazed how well my deck was suppling me with cards at the right moment (I got Gandalf for example having threat at 49). Despite the fact that I was few step from loosing most of the game I was still able to win and I declared my deck invincible for this scenario (come on … can you get much worse start than 2 trolls?). Since I had some time left and the game was already set up I decided to play once more just for fun to see how well I will do. This time despite the fact that the encounter deck was (a bit, but still) kinder to me I never seamed to draw cards that I needed (just the opposite from the previous try). I lost to threat. I declared this play unlucky and decided to go again. This time was trounced again (encounter deck first raised my threat by 8 when I was ready to kill the troll and then slowly the trecheries killed my huge ally army) and I was doomed. That pissed me off! I tweked my deck by swapping some of the cards with those from the hunt for Gollum adventure pack (for the first time). This time I won again …
-------------------------------------
[General] So far Journey down the Anduin is by far the best quest for solo players. Passage through Mirkwood is a bit on the easy side and it is fairly repetitive as far as quest stages go. Escape for Dul Guldur is just too hard solo (although I will try to play it again soon). I like the Hunt for Gollum but once you know how it plays it's ending seems a bit anti-climactic. JdtA starts with an earthquake (troll), it tension rises (as more and more things flood the staging area), to reach excellent finale (when you try to time going to last stage with as few enemies as possible in the staging area)

 Scenarios played:
NinjaDorg's Scenario 3 - Forgotten Ruins
NinjaDorg's Scenario 4 - The Elven Assembly
both with my regular deck (Spirit/Leadership) with Eowyn, Dunhere, Theodred. Both won on first try (in Forgotten Ruins case it was a fairly close win as far as wounds on the heroes go, The Elven Assembly was won really easily)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Pacing of Forgotten Ruins is just ideal for new players, it gives you time to prepare before attacking you hard (with Spawn and later with Nazgul), it teaches you to time completing the stages right, shows importance of allies and lower threat. I consider it to be easier then Journey down the Anduin and would recommend it for all players that finished Passage through Mirkwood. The Elven Assembly was very easy to beat and never posed a real threat (although I was fairly lucky with my draws of the Orks that happen few times in the quest).
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[General] I played two previous custom scenarios by NinjaDorg's some time ago and I liked them quite a bit. Now I am ready to form an initial opinion on the whole series (I am still planing on trying the following scenarios as well to see how they differ). This series of scenarios should be recommended to all new players (some of them even before Passage through Mirkwood), I really think that will teach important game concepts without tossing new players into the deep water right away (I am looking at you Journey down the Anduin). There is a drawback to this namely NinjaDorg's scenarios get much easier with increased player card pool much faster then the original ones that still propose a decent challenge.

My almost standard spirit/leadership deck led by Eowyn, Dunhere and Theodred against two NinjaDorg's scenarios 5 & 6. Won both cases.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] I liked both scenarios despite the fact that I managed to win them both on first try (in the case of Ungoliant's Lair it helped that I have read the scenario and knew what to expect).
- Ungoliant's Lair - This is what I call a one trick pony scenarios. There is a certain mechanic/restriction built to the scenario and if you are surprised by it on first try it is likely that you will loose. Once you are familiar with it then it is much easier to succeed and scenario becomes much easier.
- Branching Paths - explores the concept that I find very interesting namely that your choices at the end of the scenario impact what stage you will face next. This particular quest did not fully explore the potential of this approach (as choices were quite easy) but showed that it can be done and can be very interesting.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Global] Again I want to reiterate that FFGs scenarios seem to handle repeat plays much better then the custom ones while the latter are much better suited for new players. I love the fact that people do create those as it greatly increases longevity of the game. Kudos to all people that develop them.

My now "standard" spirit/leadership deck led by Eowyn, Dunhere and Theodred against Conflict at the Carrock. Won three times.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] I was able to defeat Conflict at the Carrock three times in the row using my battle tested deck. At first I was a bit disappointed that I did not have to rebuild my deck times and times again before succeeding with the scenario. Now that I had some time to reflect on it all three tries required very careful play and the encounter deck did put a lot of pressure on me (be it in the danger that mass attack of trolls or enormous threat that accumulated in the staging area). This is my second favorite scenario (just bellow Journey down the Anduin) now and I hope to replay it few more times although I can see it would be much harder without any of the used spheres - spirit (threat reduction, questing) and leadership (allies, resource type)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Global] Unfortunately I allowed guys from the Cardboard of the Rings podcast to spoil the scenarios for me (I stated to listen just when I got the game). Despite the fact that I enjoyed listening to it I decided against doing that in order to explore scenarios on my own. This seems to be a huge problem with discussions on the game. Many of the scenarios rely on surprise factor and if it gets spoiled you loose two or three plays before gaining experience required to rebuild your deck and those first games might be really really fun as you tweak and re-tweak your deck.
One thing that starts to annoy me are difficulty levels of the scenarios. Those are really off as far as solo plays goes. How can be Escape from Dul Guldur that is famous for being almost un-beatble solo be on the same difficulty level as Conflict at the Carrock that I manged to best with my (strong but still) regular deck?

yeah the difficulty ratings really are meaningless….some quests are harder solo, some multiplayer. personally i have found the dwarrowdelf cycles all to be easier than their tag

Conflict at the Carrock - lost, won, lost. Again with my standard Eowyn. Dunhere, Theodred spirit/leadership deck
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Local]I am glad that I decided to replay CatC again after my 3 successful runs against it last time. This time the scenario bared its fangs against me and showed me what it can do. First started in a pretty standard way I fielded tons of allies and was slowing down my progress on the quest as much as possible but there was one thing different - I could not draw any threat reduction cards (despite the fact that I managed to draw 4 or 6 additional cards due to valiant sacrifices). Also the threat deck attacked me in a sneaky way accelerating threat increase in few ways. Then it suddenly allowed me to go to the second stage (to tell the truth I was risking it before I was afraid of additional threat increase if I quested with not enough). Then the trolls came down. I actually would succeeded defending and slaying them in 3 rounds or so (I had so many allies after all that I was not scared of loosing some of them) … but there is one trick to the trolls attacking all at once - your threat goes up whopping 12 points. This was the end for my party.
Win was not much different then before. Third attempt was interesting again as this time encounter deck managed to kill me (not me not drawing right cards as in the first case). Dunhere was sacked on first turn, next the standard troll came up. Those two things combined meant that I was behind in resource generation. I was not able to field enough allies as I had to use resources on threat reduction. When I was finally tricked into the second stage I had only few guys on my side and the regular troll still engaged. I killed it with sneak attacking Gandalf but had to engage another troll (otherwise I would have to quest with all team just to stay equal with staging area) but this still left me with no force to kill buffed up troll and not enough quest power to take care of the Carrock. I gave up when left with two enemies (troll and snake) engaged threat at 33 and no allies (Dunhere was still sacked). FUN TIMES!
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] No new thoughts here just the fact that randomness inherit to all card games can trick players - someone might say after few lucky plays that the game was is too easy and never play again. Someone might be so flustered by loosing constantly an fell that even the easies scenario is HARD. I think that talking to the community (BGG/FFG) and playing each scenarios many many times will give you the right perspective (and maybe great in helping you to locate rules mistake - if you are succeeding/failing dramatically more often than others).

Journey to Rhosgobel -Lore/Leadership deck led by Bilbo, Beravor and Gloin
-----------------------------------------
[Local] I've had a lot of hopes for this scenario. I was looking forward to finally completely changing my deck in order to heal the eagle and for the first time I was disappointed in the scenario. Most of the lore healing cards can not be used to help the eagle, you need a decent questing power as your patient is receiving wounds very fast … and you need ton of luck to find "the cure". After my two plays I was about to say that my previous deck would deal with this scenario better than the new one despite the lack of healing cards. Luckily after some careful consideration I am convinced that I need lore to win this scenario with a decent regularity.
-----------------------------------
[Global] I am starting to see weakness in the card pool/scenario design of this game. Namely Spirit sphere seams to be almost a must have in solo plays. I would like to see other spheres becoming more appealing (don't even get me started on Tactics and solo) or scenarios that require you to use strengths of other spheres. This is why I think Journey to Rhosgobel was a disappointment as in my mind it was promising just that and delivered it only partially. Anyway I will still play this scenario few times before writing it off.

A Journey to Rhosgobel 
Win twice lost twice. Lore/Spirit deck led by Denethor, Glorfindel and Eowyn
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] After my initial disappointment with the quest I decided to change my heroes, deck and strategy. I decided to try to complete the quest as fast as possible hoping to pickup just enough (two) good cards from my hands (Lore of Imladris) or from encounter deck (Athelas). I decided to exchange heroes with card drawing capabilities (Bilbo, Berevor) for cards providing it (Lorien's Wealth, Ancient Mathom + Erebor Hammersmith, Gleowine). Now my heroes had better stats and other useful abilities (especially Denethor's encounter deck control was useful at the beginning). I liked the quest much better this time as 
- I discovered that lore is an interesting (and powerful) sphere
- Without leadership (and its resource generation abilities) choices of which cards to play are more interesting
- Same thing with the increased number of cards in hand (due to card drawing abilities) 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Global] I like how the change of spheres, changes the way the game plays. Although I still think that this scenario is not perfect for forcing you into different path/play style (as it seems that again you are forced into choosing Spirit) it is interesting change from other scenarios.

A Journey to Rhosgobel
Win three times, lost twice. Lore/Spirit deck led by Denethor, Glorfindel and Eowyn
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Through out my plays I adjusted the deck a bit (added one lore ranged character as I was plagued with bats and crows in one of the games and added Hasty Stroke as shadow effects in this scenario tend to be brutal - those two replaced some rarely used cards). In one of the attempts I decided to try to finish step one in one turn but the actual cost of this move (or its risk in general) was to high and I finally failed. Out of all games I mostly enjoyed the one in which I got highest score (but still managed to win) - it was exciting battle on the verge of loosing (I actually lost Glorfindel) with some creative plays and risky maneuvers.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[Global] Fantasy Flight prepared a list of players archetypes for this game at some point. They've given them some LOTR names but in short those are:
- Flavour player - builds his deck according to LOTR reality (e.g. will never use Frodo as he was not active/alive during official period of time).
- Combo player - enjoys finding synergies between the cards
- Must win player - enjoys winning and this is most important for him (or goes for the lowest score even at the risk of several losses before getting it).
I find my self in between those categories. I am not a hardcore lotr fan and I do not care if cards are in accordance to book timeline but I do enjoy the stories that this game tells. I like to find combos and synergies and I am usually quite impressed with them but I do not actively seek/invent them and test them out - I am more of one card at the time guy who is often pleasantly surprised when two cards work in concert. Finally I do construct decks to win but I am more for consistency (high percentage) of wins then about high score or 100% even success rate.

The Hills of Emyn Muil
Played twice with Spirit/Leadership deck (Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred) - won once, lost once.
---------------------------------------------
[Local] Finally I broke a dry spell that kept me away from LOTR:LCG for more then a month (mainly caused by our summer holidays) and went to journey to the hills of Emyn Muil. From various sources (my first play was around the time this expansion was released so I was still listening/reading comments back then) I knew that this scenario is location heavy so I prepared a team/deck ready for it. It worked quite well in my first attempt and I beat the scenario by round 8 (I had 19 VPs on turn 5 and needed 3 more to find the final one). I deemed the quest fairly easy at this point but decided that I want to see some more of it and tried again. It started even better then before but then boom … around round four I drew an avalanche (Treachery - all characters committed to the quest receive 2 wounds) followed by (as there were no locations in the staging area) by necromancer reach (1 wound to each exhausted character). This killed Eowyn and almost all allies (except Faramir who was waiting to boost will power). I was sure that I am dead at this point but decided to press on. Surely enough next turn proved me right - I had to reveal 3 cards from the encounter deck (second one had surge) revealing two enemies and another Necromancer's Reach - with Theodred dead and two enemies that would destroy my remaining forces fast I concluded the game. I am planing to play the scenario few more times as I haven't seen many cards at all yet. I am also considering swaping Leadership for some healing from Lore as I need more ways than just the Test of Will to counter nasty treacheries or their effects. This quest is not so great but mainly due to the fact that is very similar to Hunt for Gollum (there you were hunting for clues here you are looking for additional victory points). 
-------------------------------------------------
[Global] I am a bit disappointed with this quest and I am bit afraid of the game interest in the long run if this trend continues - mainly due to the fact that puts pressure on you not in some interesting way but using blunt force (it seems that some cards should have written on them - kill your characters unless you play test of will). On the other hand I was quick to write of the A Journey to Rhosgobel so maybe the fault is in my deck design - maybe I should add heroes with more hit points instead of relaying on countering bad draws from encounter deck. This is will be interesting to see. Anyway let me continue with my original thought - I really hope that in subsequent scenarios FFG will find creative ways to make them hard instead of hitting you with harder and harder instant (almost) kill cards as this makes tactical part of the game a bit dull and frustrating. I would much rather see some impending doom slowly approaching and thinking hard on how to avoid it - instead of drawing "BOOM YOU ARE DEAD" cards.

two points for you to note

1.emyn muil is the most llinear quest you will find, so do not fear, it is an idea ffg do not repeat on

and

2. these instant kill cards are rare in future packs however i warn you in dwarrowdelf there are certainly a couple that make emyn muil treacheries look like cake…..these are often complained about by players so im sure ffg will take this into account in future design

 This thread is super awesome. I am tempted to try my own 100 game marathon. I'd have to trick it up somehow, so as not to simply copy the great, fun work that you are doing here. 

I could make it all two player games with my friend Zack. See if our friendship survives. Perhaps play through the quests in chronological order, only advance to the next one after beating the one before. See how far we can get before the 100 game "timer" runs out. The same quest 100 times? That's just madness. 

Perhaps put some aspect of the game to a vote: let people pick one of the heroes to play and build the deck around it? Maybe vote how many different quests I'd be allowed to run in the 100 plays (1 quest 100 times, 2 quests 50 times, 4 quests 25 times, etc). 

Anyway, keep up the great work.

Rich - thanks for your comment …it got me thinking about this quest and you can read my thoughts in my next post. Also thanks for the heads up that I might still see some of the instant kill treacheries in the future.

DrNate, thanks for taiking the time to read my thoughts and commenting. As for one hundred plays - here are some random thoughts:
- it is not so hard to do with this game. I frankly believe that you can do it with just a core set (and maybe some custom scenarios for BGG). I think I played Journey down the Anduin around 40 or 50 times.
- I like your idea with having 100 attempts and see how far one could go while going to the next quest only after beating the previous one.
- playing solo is a bit more restrictive in that you usually can't play with every possible combination of spheres as often times you need a very very good deck and/or excellent combination just to have a decent shot at winning.

Scenario: The Hills of Emyn Muil
Heroes/Spheres: Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (Spirit/Leadership)
Played: 4 times
Results: 3 won and 1 lost

------------------------------------------
[Local] I decided to play few more times with my already constructed deck just to see how it will do. As expected I did fairly well on most of my attempts although I did loose once and did not menage to beat my score (although each time I was closer to it). At times it was a bit frustrating that I was missing one or two victory points and for several turns I was just waiting for them to show up. As a side note: On Polish LOTR:LCG forum I saw a comment from one of the user claiming that he always play the game while listening to the soundtrack of the Peter Jackson movies. I decided to do the same (I own an audio casette with soundtrack from the first movie :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]! ) and I have to say it did increase my enjoyment of the game especially when "a danger music" was playing when I was drawing from the encounter deck! 
------------------------------------------
[General] In his comment FFG's forum user richsabre called this scenario the most linear one and that got me thinking about it some more. From what I saw so far from the game I agree totally with his assessment. I would even go so far as to say that this scenario lacks any story arc and or progressions. In other adventure packs when you flip the scenario card you are often faced with a tempo change, need for change of strategy and so on. This gives you the feel that you are indeed on a journey and you arrived at the turning point. In "The Hills of Emyn Muil" you have none of that - you do not get see the story in your actions - you are randomly traveling from one location to the next hoping to visit just enough of them to "win". It is just not that satisfying or interesting as it does not tell a story.  
 
NOTE: Milestone reached - I now played this game 100 times … I still have almost 40 commented plays to go but we are getting there.

Scenario: The Hills of Emyn Muil
Heroes/Spheres: Eowyn, Frodo, Dunhere (Mono Spirit)
Played: 4 times
Results: 2 won and 2 lost
------------------------------------------
[Local] After playing 6 times with my Spirit Leadership deck I knew that it would do fairly well against this scenario so I decided to change my deck in order to explore new grounds. Instinct told me that Spirit/Lore combo would do even better here but I saw an opportunity that I did not explore for a long time - playing with a mono sphere deck. In this scenario spirit was an obvious choice so I went with it. I enjoyed this scenario with this deck even more despite the fact that it was less efficient then my previous deck. In fact I saw much more interesting decisions this time around and if fact I could have avoided one of my losses with an optimal play. I enjoyed the first attempt the most when I managed to win despite the fact that Eowyn was killed fairly early on. In another notable game I was overrun by enemies in the staging area (despite the fact that encounter deck in this game is very enemy light).
------------------------------------------
[General] As mentioned before this scenario lacks a lot in terms of telling a story but sometimes the encounter deck will make up for it. I think that still designers/developers could have done better with this scenario but it can be engaging with a bit of help from Lady (Un)Luck and the encounter deck. That is why it is good to play each scenario several times even if you don't like it so much on your first tries.

 

NOTE: Sorry for the triple post but I did not have time to post my plays and comments directly after playing the game so I am forced to do it all at once now.

Scenario: Dead Marches
Heroes(spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (Spirit/Leadership)
Played once - won.
-------------------------------------------------------
[Local] I very much like decisions that this quest forces you to make - which characters you will hold back and which will be send to quest. Those though and delicious dilemmas make this scenario great fun as you constantly need to balance the two risks (fail to quest vs fail to prevent from running away) and sometimes the threat deck will add an additional risk in front of you - now you are almost sure that you will fail at something. I praised the mechanic of this quest enough and I definitely recommend it but at the same time I have to say that in my first play those mechanics definitely made the theme take the back seat. I hope that once I play it few more times then the "cat and mouse chase" with Gollum will be more apparent to me.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
[General] This was the first quest that I played without any prior knowledge on what to expect. This is definitely the way to play them as you get surprised by the challenges and you get a fun "I don't know what's coming next" felling. On the other hand I am strangely disappointed that I manged to beat it on first try. It would be so much more exciting to rebuild my deck after initial fail (especially because that I was "flying blind"). I guess my complaint is that I would like the scenarios to force me to rebuild my deck and change my approach every time. I of course understand that some people will try to play through all scenarios with one deck, so maybe this is just an expectations issue but still this is where I stand so far.

Scenario played: The Dead Marches
Date: 21,22,23 Sep 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 9 times and won all of them
---------------------------------------------
[Local] This was a nice and pleasant weekend in The Dead Marches. I've spent the most time playing the game since my initial excitement just after getting it and it was really fun. I've played the scenario with the same deck as before twice and found out that two or three cards do not get played so often. I was shocked to discover that Sneak Attack was one of them but after moment of reflection I've swapped it for some more allies. All attempts after that were played with this improved deck. Here are some random thoughts:
- I am still learning how to play my cards well. As an example: at first I was playing unexpected courage on Thedored thinking he will quest (generate a resource) and then attack. Next game I was playing it on Frodo thinking I first need to be able to defend against a monster before I will attack it. Finally after few more games I realized that Eowyn is the best target for unexpected courage - she can both quest and guard/track Gollum at the same time and Frodo and Theodred can both be ready for combat if needed. Now it seems so obvious but I am glad that I am still improving in this game.
- Games with high score were the most exciting ones. My deck was not totally ready for dealing with two (or more) low engagement cost enemies at the very beginning (before fielding tons of allies) and it required clever tactics and hue threat gain at start which made every further step dangerous.
- As I said before playing this scenario is fun because it forces you to make though choices (as you will almost surely fail some escape tests).
- Consistent wins are nice change of pace. In this scenario I got 10/10 win ratio. In other case I thought that win percentage above 60% is great here it was fun hopping for winning all attempts.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[General] After a longer period during which I played the game a bit less I am glad to be back in a full swing. LOTR:LCG is hugely dependent on the quality of scenarios prepared by FFG - boring one can limit your enjoyment and even make you less excited about the game in general and great one … suffice to say I got my copy of Khazad-dûm today. Of course I understand that one's enjoyment depends on the personal preference and what gets me excited might be most boring to others so FFG is in a difficult spot here but in general as far as I can see they do a fairly good job at "keeping all those balls in the air".
I also would like to stress that part of what keeps me playing the game after so many sessions is the fact that I am still learning it. I am forced to question my choices of the cards (like removing sneak attack) and my tactical strategies of playing cards. This is one of the reasons (next to its expandable nature) that this game has such an amazing re-playability.

 Scenario played: Return to Mirkwood

Date: 25 Sep 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 5 times - first two losses and then 3 wins
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Great experience continues! When I saw a rating difficulty 7 on this scenario I first thought that after great success with The Dead Marches nothing will stop me. I adjusted my deck a bit (to be more universal since I didn't knew what to expect) and prepared the encounter cards. BAAAM second card threat goes up 8 points, turn later great 8 attack spiders engage me … I am dead before going to stage 3 as threat skyrockets once I need to defend the spiders with Frodo). "Oh no!" - my killer deck defeated so easily? This can't be! Bring it on again! This time I fare much better though the constant threat rise is though. This time I go to the stage three and can't believe my eyes - I am not allowed to play cards! Soon I am swamped with enemies and locations in the staging area … I am barely keeping up with opposing threat and the progress on the quest is just too slow. The main spider from Passage through Mirkwood appears - threat goes up - enemies go down from staging … I am dead. WOW! I am desperate at this point … is this another escape from Dol Guldur experience? Luckily before putting the cards to the box I examine my hand and cards in front of me … why do I keep so many Dunedain warnings and marks? Those are close to useless. Back to the deck drawing board. Remove those cards and few others, more allies in. Next three tries and all won! Great tense games with tension rising all the way … well read next time when I will write some more about the quest (spoiler: it is brilliant!!!).
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] Discussing the game on Polish message boards I discovered that I was counting my points wrong (starting with round 1 instead of zero and according to the rules you are supposed to tally a round only at its end). I was pretty sure that at this point I had all the rules down and I still discovered something. This is not a big deal as it only affects scoring which is not that important but … it makes me think. What else am I missing or playing wrong? This is a major drawback of solo game (or if you only play games in the same group) - there is no one to correct you. In other games (CCGs/LCGs especially) you have tournaments, fairly regular plays with different people and that soon enough allows you to discover if you play something incorrectly. There is nothing like that in this game (at least for me) so I am left to hope spotting my mistakes during some discussions at the forums. Mind you I am not interested in the tourneys and even playing this game with others (well I would like to do the former but I don't see me finding time for that) but I think that getting all rules right for this game is important to get the difficulty level planned by the designer. On the positive note - my games are preatty though in most cases so I am satisfied with difficulty anyway even if I am slightly off at some things :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 3 times - all wins
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] RtM become my favorite scenario just beating out The Journey Down the Anduin (which is harder for me so in the long run it might regain its spot as a favorite). So what do I like about it do much:
- Pacing, pacing and once more pacing - This scenario forces you to sprint (not run but sprint) there is no time to wait and build up your "fellowship". Crazy fast threat rise fells like an avalanche running down just at your heels. You are out of breath and still need to accelerate.
- What is even better that you are running towards the most difficult stage (stage 3 - no cards can be played) and here you just wish you have stayed in the previous stage a bit longer to be more prepared but a glance at your threat dial proves that you didn't have time to do that.  
- As you can gather from the above the quest feels so thematic - enemies are just behind you, Gollum does his share to slow your progress and puts you in even more danger - you are out of breath from running and still have to face enemies and if Attercop, Attercop appears - your allies will have to stay behind and die just to allow others to escape towards safety. 
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] I am usually mechanics over theme (but I need both to enjoy a game) person but when both of them come together then there is a great chance for me to find gaming gems. This scenario proved to me LOTR:LCG can raise to that with a right scenario. With the previous one (The Dead Marches) was great in terms of mechanics and though decisions you were forced to make but lacked a bit in the theme. In Return to Mirkwood mechanics are a bit weaker but give you the excellent theme of running away from a pursuit while guarding an unwilling prisoner and in all it succeeded in delivering (not much but still) better gaming experience. For the future I am hoping for both kinds (better mechanics or stronger theme) of good scenarios though and from time to time this gem kind to top it off.

Scenario played: Return to Mirkwood
Date: 30 Sep 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 2 times - 1 loss and 1 win
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] After my several wins in a row I got cocky. I decided to let two undefended attacks go to Gollum (bringing him down to 1 HP) instead of slowing my progress and sure enough it costed me the game (bats engaged me and killed Gollum with forced effect). This was a reminder that despite my very good deck this scenario is hard and it punishes bad decisions severely. I was more cautious next time and despite though times manged to win my 10th attempt. I still love this scenario but just to try to be objective I will try to point few of its weaker points in this comment:
- Solo vs Muti-player - I am almost exclusively solo player (official rules) and I see that this scenario is easier at some points (stage two has no effect) and harder at other (there is no possibility to "share" the threat that Gollum generates, stage 3 is brutal solo). In general I think it is much harder solo which might make this scenario far less exciting with more players.
- Using "tournament legal deck rules" the treacheries that forces you to discard 10 cards are almost good (give you more options for dwarven tomb). If playing with more optimal deck (say 30 cards) those might be more dangerous.
- As usual I fell that you have to play spirit in solo games of it (threat reduction gives you more time, you need to quest fast and hard, test of will is really really good). This is if you read my comments on regular basis a constant complaint from my part - it might just mean that I am too attached to this sphere, I do not try to beat scenarios with other combinations and so on … but still if you want consistent wins against this scenario it is almost a must which is disappointing.
- Last step of the scenario seems a bit anticlimactic. Yeah, on paper it looks dangerous - all enemies engage you. In my experience though there are rarely any enemies in the staging area at this point and the step is so short that you finish it in the next round so even if some monsters do appear in next staging step they do not have a chance to attack you as the game is done before that.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] I am curious what other people think but I am starting to think that most of the player cards we get in adventure packs are pretty weak (or in case of some frankly useless). This becomes even more of an issue if you are restricted to solo gaming as I am. This is not a huge issue for me as I am more into the new scenarios but still I would like some more interesting cards for underutilized spheres (lore and tactics in my case). I understand that part of an issue comes form the fact that I am only looking to build a single deck that is efficient against a scenario during multiple attempts. Some other players might be more interested just exploring the interactions between their cards and have tons of fun trying various possible combos even if those work only every now and then. Now after typing that I think that maybe the current model is ideal - cards for me (new scenario) and cards for combo players (say that each card means at least one attempt gives 9 attempts which is roughly the same as I am doing). Still I found some post by people that were so disappointed with quality and quantity of new player cards that they've quit playing the game (Khazad Dum contents was a deal breaker for many it seems).

Scenario played: Massing at Osgiliath
Date: 1 Oct 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 3 times - lost twice and won once
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] So after my exciting attempts against the Return to Mirkwood scenario I was ready to face my next challenge - POD scenario: Massing at Osgiliath. I've heard that this was very difficult scenario but after great success with previous one I was pretty confident. First game started quite well first stage was quickly conquered, in the second one I was moving at much slower speed. Finally I was able to go to the third - discard a hero (I have not been lucky enough to encounter the ranger) to be able to quest!? I was not sure what is waiting in stage three but I was certain that the Witchking will show up but decided to discard Theodred (as he is not as crucial later in the quest). I was kind of hoping for a short last stage but when 15 quest progress requirement was raveled I knew I was doomed. Threat counter reached 50 next turn. I've decided to play with this deck again just to see if it was its inefficiencies that got me killed or is this scenario is just this hard. This time I've progressed throgh the first stage even faster. I felt that I am in a good shape - quite a few resources (steward of Gondor), had an unexpected courage. The next stage halted me though - I was cut off (discard allays from hand - bye bye Gandalf ready to be summoned twice with quick strike) so all my resources were growing but I've had no cards to spend them on. I was able to go a bit further but staging area quickly was growing dangerous (I've had many enemies sitting there and no way to deal with them). Things snowballed from there and again threat killed me as I've entered stage 3. This was a sign that I need to redesign my deck. Few more stronger allies, few more dunedain attachments, few less events. That all helped I think … but what really allowed me to win was to finally see that I do not need to go quickly through this scenario. This strategy was necessary before but this time … I've taken my sweet time in the first stage of the quest, fielding my allies. I was very much ready when I've went to the second stage. This time also payed off because Ranger of Ithilien showed up and I knew that I was ready for stage three. With so many allies in play and relatively low threat I optionally engaged Witchking and was able to pay "his threat due" to keep him engaged. Three allies had to die to defend his attacks but in the end … I've escaped and won the scenario. In some sense like this scenario very much and in some sense I am disappointed. The strategy for it is the same as for Conflict at the Carrock. Build up in the first stage and just than proceed to the following stages - this feature I do not like especially because it feels a bit anti-thematic. Your heroes spotted a large force of enemies but they are staying behind taking their time, preparing equipment, finding allies etc and just then the mad pursuit begins only after they are ready. So that is bad … but luckily there is good as well. This mad pursuit is great and very very thematic. You are laving men behind just to buy time, you need to leave someone to buy you time to get through the river and then with dwindling force you are running towards the safety of the white city.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] I do not know if this intentional. This scenario in some sense feels like an much improved version of Conflict at the Carrock. Of course it only fells like this in an approach you have to take to beat it but still there is a strong connection here for me. This in one sense a good thing because you should improve on good concepts and create even better experiences for the players. Nevertheless like with all things improved version sometimes gives you the "been there, done that" felling - yeah it is better … but it is not new. I try not fall into this trap of considering those improvements inferior due to not bringing anything revolutionary - because we need improvements on existing things (and games) to achieve greatness. I will try harder next time when I sit down to play Massing at Osgiliath because at the end of the day as it stands this scenario is amazing on its own.

I enjoy your posts. Keep it up! Looking forward to your thoughts on The Hobbit!

 

 

…you play alot more than I do, by the way…

## 42 [player543086 on October 11, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65376-wojos-beyond100-plays-challenge-comments-update-the-redhorn-gate-conclusion/?do=findComment&comment=707901)

 Glad to hear that you enjoy my post. As for hobbit I still have a long way to go as I will be playing the game in order it was released. Unfortunately this last two weeks I had little time to play the game as my schedule was very crazy but I am hoping that next week I will be back with more thoughts about the game.

Plan for next few posts is:
- Reach 10 plays of Massing
- Return to Core Set - see can I have a better luck against Escape From Dul Guldur with more player cards and experience
- Into the Khazad-dum

As a side notes:
- I just bought 3 first adventure packs from the second cycle. This were the first ones that I got new.
- I am really excited about Heirs of Númenor as I am impressed by the elegant way in which sieges and battles were implemented into the LOTR:LCG system.

Scenario played: Massing at Osgiliath
Date: 11 Oct 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 2 times - lost once and won once
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] After my first successful attempt last time against the Massing at Osgiliath I wanted to check if the new modification of my standard deck and discovered strategy will be able to beat the scenario on a regular basis. First try was showing exactly that: I had quite a few allies, tons of resources (Eowyn had Steward of Gondor and Song of Kings) and I was even able to draw quite lot of cards. The only worry I had was threat I could not draw Galdaiers greeting for the life of me and some unlucky shadow cards (removing defender from combat) meant that Fordo had to convert tons of damage into threat. I was in the last stage of the quest and had 4 threat left before defeat. I could not afford to keep Whichking engaged but with all those allies and Faramir in play I was quite sure that I will manage to win. I made decent progress, Witchking engaged me, Snowburnt Scout was the designated defender … shadow card … remove defender from combat. I was devastated 6 damage to threat through Frodo meant I lost. EXCEPT later when going to sleep I realized that I could have sacrificed Frodo or Theodred and would be able to win next turn. This scenario does not leave much room for mistakes. Next time despite quite a bad draw at the begging I was able to win it was a struggle at least as the game length goes (17 turns, I've managed to go through all of the encounter cards) - although I was not able to field large army of allies I was quite luck as far as threat reduction goes. I also would have killed the Witchking (he had 8 damage on him) same turn as I completed the quest. Fun times.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] I like how the scenario showed me that if I get careless and stop thinking it will punish me. I wonder now how many of the defeats I suffered could have been avoided if I just be more concentrated and saw a way out. This time I "paid the price" by playing according with the assumption - you can never allow your heroes to die. I am glad in fact that I realized that this is not the case - there are some very interesting (and thematic) plays available if you trow this assumption away. I still believe that if you loose a hero (I am talking about solo) at the start a game you will likely loose but … towards the end of scenarios it is not so. I am glad that the game forces me to question my strategic assumptions after so many plays.

Scenario played: Massing at Osgiliath
Date: 14 Oct 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 1 times - won
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Short comment this time. The scenario wanted me to reinforce the lesson from last time - sometimes you need to sacrifice a hero in order to win. What is funny - I almost missed it this time again and was about to admit to a defeat through reaching 50 threat (using Frodo ability to soak damage).
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] Recently I bought FFGs card boxes (more on this some other time) this allowed me to get the game with me "on the road" (ussing one box and 4 small containers for counters). I used to do it a lot in the beginning but soon my card pool extended so much that it did not make sense any more. Now I can do it again and it is very convenient especially if I already decided on the deck and scenario I will play.

NOTE: I played the game 3 times yesterday - I hope to log those plays today as well.

 Scenario played: Massing at Osgiliath
Date: 16 Oct 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 3 times - lost once, won twice
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Few observations:
- In my first attempt I decided I want to see if I can kill Witchking (and would it made scenario easier) and in fact I almost accomplished it. But while attempting this I got too many enemies engaged with me and despite killing the big bad I was was stomped by smaller guys. They were able to kill my allies and my hope to run away and finish the scenario was buried by Pelenor Field ("auto travel" location with 7 progress tokens requirements).
- Next time was a nail baiter. I had a quite bad card draw at the beginning (actually the draw was decent but I was cut off soon and lost nice allies). It took me long time to build a decent team and moving no further. Threat was a real danger through out, despite a decent progress made once I started moving. I was sure that I will be killed again but few good draws (especially Eomyr? - the guy who reduces threat increase from encounter cards while he is ready) allowed me to win with a terrible score - 209 but a great feeling of just making it - threat 49.
- In this attempt my deck showed what it can do if I am lucky with draws. First time ever I had 3 Sneak Attacks and 2 Gandalfs near the end of stage 3. I could have played my cards better (score wise) but I went and killed Witchking :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. Final score 133.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] One thing that is great in replaying single scenario several times is that you get "some feeling" towards certain cards. For example you learn to hate Witchking, love some treacheries that are not so devastating. This enhances play experience as you are rooting for certain cards to appear, cursing others when they show up. This increases excitement and ultimately gives you better experience. Of course there is a breaking point here - you can burn out on a scenario if played too many times in a row. So far I found that 10 attempts is just right for me. I am just curious when I will get around to replaying scenarios again. With so many new waiting for my I am afraid that it will not be as soon as I would like but we shall see.

Didn't have enough in the threat bank to take the hit instead of travelling?

 Hmmm good point … I do not remember at this point but I actually forgot that you can opt not to travel to Pelenor Fields by paying threat. Would love to be able to recreate this situation and check … it would be great (in a sense :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ) to know that I lost due to my own mistake. 

Anyway thanks for reminding me about this option on Pelenor Fields - this is my fault sometimes I tend to play without rereading cards often enough so it sometimes mean that I forget about less used options.

Scenario played: Massing at Osgiliath
Date: 17 Oct 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 2 times - lost once, won once
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] In my first attempt I was as unlucky as I was lucky in my previous game (the one with 3 sneak attacks on Gandalf). My ally count was very low in initial hand (despite using mulligan) and I was swamped with enemies in the staging area. I was kind of hoping to get many cards from two Ancient Mathom but I simply did not have enough questing power to put any progress on active location. I died on turn 4. In the second try it was much better. I had a decent draw and early Ranger of Ithilien allowed me to move to stages 2, 3 and 4 much earlier then usual, I was able to achieve my second best score of 143 despite the fact that I did not have a spectacular draw as before.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] It is time to present my final thoughts about this scenario. In short I liked it very much - I am sure that it is in my top 3 favorite ones for now. At first I was a bit surprised why people rate it so highly but as I was playing it more and more I came to similar conclusion. I have only two knocks against it as far as its design goes:
- Idea of putting good cards into the encounter deck is great and very exciting but it makes it a bit more random then usual scenario. If you draw them early you will have much easier time if you do not see them at all. I think it might be more interesting of you had some sub quest that you would have to sacrifice something (time, resources, progress tokens) to get them under your control.
- The initial step where you almost have to stay behind to prepare for later assault does not work thematically. I know, it would be enough to change flavor text on the first card a bit to make it work … but for some reason it bothers me.
There are many positive points so I will mention just one of them that seem to be a bit less obvious:
- 40 card encounter deck that you almost go through works much better in delivering consistent play experience then the regular larger ones (composed of cards from the core set and scenario). In the second case you often get easy plays (example drawing only core cards as encounter cards) or hard ones (only scenario ones drawn).
In short other positive points:
- Pacing, excellent stage 3 and 4, very good climax, nice thematic distinction between locations (west vs east bank), high reply value.

Scenario played: Escape from DG
Date: 29 Oct 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 5 times (even more but I do not count games that lasted shorter than 2-3 turns) - Lost all of them (as expected :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Finally I decided to try my battle (MatO) tested deck against the bane of all solo players - Escape from DG. Come on, the old core set scenario, how hard it can be? Well as you can see from my results despite the fact that my pool of cards was greatly enhanced since first attempts it is still pretty much un-winnable :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. I lost two or three games on setup (say two enemies amd caught in the web guarding objectives). In few others I was not able to move past the first stage of the quest. The most interesting attempts were the first one and the last one.
During the first one I got a decent hand and average encounter deck draws (some terrible some easy ones). I was able to move past stage one, have a prisoner rescued and was able to balance the threat from the staging area for several turns that allowed me to draw two sneak attacks and Gandalf. I was ready to announce that I will do it! Then I got a treachery that forced me to discard all events from my hands … after that few enemies appeared back to back in the staging area and slowly I was overwhelmed.
Last attempt was even more successful. I was able to move past stage two and I even was ready to take the Nazgul down. Threat was very high at this point unfortunately and enemies plus shadow effects soon took me above 50. I decided to play just to see how much over I would have to go … I was able "to win" with threat dial showing 58.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] My thoughts on Escape from Dul Guldur are not settled yet - I like the challenge on one hand but I am cursing the ridiculous difficulty on the other. I will try to make my mind about it latter as I decided to see if further player cards will make this beatable. Into the Khazad Dum next!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With those plays I completed the original 100 commented plays challenge. It took me 5 months to do it which averages 20 plays a month or 5 plays per week throughout. I am glad that I did it as it not only gave me an additional push to play the game more but it forced me to think about it much more and see its particular elements in more analytic light. That in turn also greatly enhanced my enjoyment.

So what now? I will continue playing LOTR:LCG and continue writing my thoughts down as long as it is still fun. I am still planning to write my "great LOTR:LCG review" but the scope I decided on seems so great that it will take a while.

Thank you for all people on FFG forums that commented on my posts it gave me much joy and additional motivation to continue.

 Khazad-Dum scenario #1
Scenario played: Into the Pit
Date: 29 Oct 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 5 times - Won, lost twice, tweaked my deck and won twice
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] First play seemed like doomed cause from the start … on the very first card from encounter deck (sudden pitfall?) I lost Frodo. I decided to carry on just to get a feel for the scenario. It was though but slowly my fellowship grew and despite missing the hero I was making a progress. I was a bit scared when the second scenario card instructed me to look for Patrol Leader but he seemed fairly harmless and the boon of discarding new enemies drawn from the encounter deck solidified this felling. Sure enough it was not so … his swing killed one of my Northern Trackers (with a little help from shadow card) and my killing attack was canceled by his ability. I calculated my chances and saw that I will not be able to kill him in one go next time around as one of my attackers would have to stand down to defend. Two swings in turn meant two chances that some damage will be be cancelled. Luckily for me I draw Gandalf and with his help I was able to kill the orc (no cancel this time). Last stage surprised me again with no resources generation but Theodred skill helped me to get few crucial cards out and I won. I was about to declare the scenario easy (well wining with only two heroes from the start made me fell confident) when next to plays happened:
- First I lost due to the threat dial exploding … treacheries and enemies kept my team down to only heroes and the amount of damage that had to be converted by Frodo to threat soon enough put me into high 40s. At the same time locations kept piling up (I was unwilling to explore Zigil Shaft using its threat raising ability and unable to overcome it in the staging area) and I made no progress … 50 was reached soon enough.
- Second one was lost by enemies chopping my team into pieces. I told you about the boon of discarding enemies in stage two? Well it turns out that enemies can show up from shadow effects as well - I had 3 goblin swordsman show up this way and this combined with Patrol Leader resistance to damage …
After those two tries I spotted 2 cards that were littering my deck (song of kings and dunedain mark) so I replaced them with more useful stuff (added 2 more copies of Elfhelm, 3x Zigil Miner and Lorien Guide). This made resource demand of my deck more balanced (more spirit cards since I have two heroes from this sphere) and in the evening I made two more attempts and this time was more successful.
- I would call this attempt - slow and steady way through the mines. I was able to menage my threat quite well and cancel some nasty shadow cards/treacheries with hasty stroke/strength of will.
- Next one was probably my favorite play of this scenario. I would entitle it: "Everything goes well until …". It was going extremely well I had ton of resources, quite a number of allies in play. I was about to take down the patrol leader when his attack shadow effect killed two of my heroes (Frodo was discarded as a defender and than Theodred had to die as a result of undefended attack). What was even worse damage from my attack was again canceled by Patrol Leader. I was about to quit … but for the last time I looked at my hand, the table. I had ton of cards but half of them was unplayable anymore with Theodred gone but I had Gandalf in hand and ton of resources on my last hero (Eowyn had a Steward of Gondor attached). I had last chance … play Gandalf and instant kill the Leader. It was cancelled of course but this time normal attack went through. Next it was a race to exit (well race up to find the book :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ). Of course enemies started to pop up from the encounter deck and watchful eyes that were placed on Eowyn. Next turn though I was able to complete this very exciting play and congratulate myself on the win and best score despite two dead heroes.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] Short thoughts as I wrote too much already:
- I have a strange felling about this scenario's difficulty. I won it twice despite loosing heroes. I lost it twice despite avoiding the worst treacheries.
- I guess it follows from the fact that in this scenario is very dangerous if you draw too many enemies at the same time. This in turns follows from the shadow effects which are frequent and quite brutal (discard defender) /annoying (cancel damage on this enemy). This makes relatively weak enemies (as Goblin Swordman) quite powerful and unpredictible at times.
- I want to bash instant kill treacheries (especially sudden pitfall) but due to my experiences I am not ready to do it yet.
- I love some treacheries that force you keep strong guys ready (exhausted hero at the end of combat=another card from the encounter deck, exhaust character and see if he is not strong enough you have to discard him).
All in all I like this scenario even if it is a bit too swingy for my taste.

Scenario played: Into the Pit
Date: 07 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Theodred (spirit/leadership)
Played 5 times - Won 3 times, lost twice
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Last time I went overboard with describing how my plays want so this time I will keep it short.
LOST:
- Thread exploded (although I kept playing and my final threat level would be 48)
- Enemies overwhelmed me. I had 3 goblin swordsmen (their shadow effect is strong) and Patrol leader engaged at one time. At this point it didn't matter that I had 5 or so allies in my fellowship. I made a mistake here of traveling to Khazad Bridge and was unable to explore it next
WON:
I will not comment much here. The deck works quite good although I should consider few more cards that can put progress tokens on locations in the staging area (ex.: replace Zigil Miner with Ridermarch Finest) to be able to move through stage one faster if I do not draw Northern Tracker or Snowburn Scout).
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] Here I planned to put my final thoughts on the scenario but it is hard. Why? Because I do not like it so much but I can't seem to pin down why. Maybe bullet list will help:
The Good:
- Excellent and thematic first stage - you need to enter through a gate, visit the first chamber and traverse the bridge.
- Nasty treacheries that you have to take into account when planing your quest phase (ex.: The one that forces you to exhaust a character and by flip of a card check if he dies can be easily avoided by committing all characters but if you get an enemy instead? By a similar token sudden pitfall forces you to send some disposable characters on the quest not to loose your strong quester with same trade off)
The Bad:
- Although the scenario really tries to tell a story of entering the mines, grabbing a goblin and looking for a book for some reason it all feels a bit forcefully put together.
- Nasty, instant kill shadow effects (sudden pitfall, goblin enemies get +3 - they all are, +2 when last player is attacked - I always am solo) … I can see how to try to deal with nasty treacheries but here there is little you can do against shadow (there is only so many hasty strokes you can draw … except see final remarks bellow*)
- Stage 3 (and a second one once you get its start under control) are a bit boring to tell the truth. Yeah resource ban at the end seems hard but ussualy at this point you do not need much anyway as you racing to the end.

*I wonder if this scenario would play better with lore sphere. I can see several cards that would work great (Denethor, burning brand, Riversong, strider path, forest snare etc.). Especially Denethor's skill could offset some nasty strings of enemies and their deadly shadow effects while spirit would take care of location and questing. Yes I guess it would work better but two of my points of criticism would still stay the same.

Scenario played: The seventh level
Date: 08 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas (earlier Boromir) (tactics/spirit)
Played 4 times: 3 loses and 1 win.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] This time I've broken my own rule and glanced at the cards composing the scenario before playing. I saw many enemies and decided to that this a good excuse to finally significantly change my deck. I got rid of leadership and went with one spirit and two tactics heroes. Here is the summary of my experiences:
- First attempt (I used Boromir here). Goblin Archers were the bane of existence this time. I had almost no way to deal with them except Gandalf (I overlooked that 3 copies of one time use attack eagle had ranged skill). At first I was not worried looking at huge amount of hit points my tactics heroes had but … when two of them were in the staging area - I was taking two (or even four) wounds in one round and my progress was completely stooped.
- I decided to modify my deck to include more ranged characters but decided that the only way to be sure to have them in play is to replace Boromir with Legolas. This time I was unable to draw any allies and with three man team the pool of events I had in my hand quickly dwindled down to handle some not so difficult situations. I was soon overwhelmed by the enemies unable to keep up with limited support.
- I reduced the number of weapons in my deck and replaced them with more allies. I also included more spirit allies as resources kept piling up on Eowyn. This time I had an excellent draw and was sure to succeed this time. Everything went well until Orc Summoner appeared - including the additional enemy from scenario I had 4 enemies in the staging area after this phase. I looked at my cards and decided that I can still pull it off. Two of my allies went down and two enemies went down but … shadow effects added next two enemies to the staging area before next round even started … which added two more. I was dead.
- I was about to give up but determination kept me going and decided to go one more. I won this time but to tell the truth it was still though and it took me 11 turns (I was fairly lucky with draws in the second stage this time). Again I had problem with the archers. I realized that Legolas without any weapon can't kill them due to their ridiculously high defence of 3. Nevertheless once I was able to deal with them it went much better.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] Oh man! This was way harder that I expected. After all FFG's DL for this scenario is 3 which is the second easiest ever. I think playtesters that assigned it were very very lucky in their attempts or their deck building skills are through the roof. In all honesty I can see that it can be very easy if you are lucky but it can kill any imaginable fellowship that you could construct with a little help of (un)luck. I feel that difficulty of particular attempt can rage from 1 all the way to 10. I do have some ideas on how to improve my deck though:

- I need more cheap allies with two willpower points - Eowyn needs support in questing at times.
- I am curious if all spirit deck can attempt to run through this scenario with reasonable chance for success.

Scenario played: The seventh level
Date: 08 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas (tactics/spirit)
Played 4 times: lost x3, won once
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] After each subsequent loss I went and adjusted my deck a little but it seems that I can't beat the quest on a regular basis. I will not go into the details of each play as the scenario seems fairly standard - I get overwhelmed by tons of enemies. As for deck tweaks I added more allies (spirit with 2 will power). What is even worse after so many failures my successful attempt didn't feel all that great and I would say that luck contributed as much to my success as deck changes.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] Wow, talk about frustrating experience! At the same time I feel like FFG is mocking me with their difficulty rating of 3 for this one and this forces me to think about new tweaks to make my deck at least semi successful against this scenario. I even resorted to reading few session reports to get some inspiration on how to improve my deck and found few interesting ideas:
- How about replacing Legolas with Thalin? The main reason for introducing Legolas was to deal with goblin archers … but what if I could kill them just when they appear from the encounter deck?
- So far I didn't include the escort from Edoras as I felt that one time use allies are a waste for this scenario. Now I see that they might allow me to quickly finish stage two of the quest when things get out of hand quickly.

What I am worried about is the loss of progress I was getting from Legolas and the fact that I will have to keep Gimli behind to attack which means loss of one will power during questing (at least at stage one). We shall see.

So despite the above negative comments you can see that I am intrigued by the scenario which is a good thing of course - it forced me to question my deck building.

For what it's worth, Seventh Level's difficulty rating seems to be set up for 2 players, since I've had the same experience as you in solo play: so hard! One way to get through the mass of orcs etc is to have Thalin questing, and then Gondorian Spearman as defender, since many many orcs in this quest only have 2 HP. It is very tough solo though, no question.

Scenario played: The seventh level
Date: 12 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Legolas (tactics/spirit)
Played 2 times, won both.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] After so many losses it was refreshing to win twice in a row. I had previously constructed deck with me and was able to play for a bit. It means that I was unable to test any of previously presented ideas but here is short description of my experiences this time:
- First try was like walk in the park. Enemies were coming one or two at the time and even troll was unable to impress me much (I used feint and killed him right after that). In three turns I was ready to go to the second stage and I was able to beat it in two turns and achieved the best score so far.
- Second one was much harder. I had three enemies (including troll) engaged with me and two more waiting in the staging area at some point. Nevertheless by "clever wound distribution" among heroes i was able to survive and put everything under control. I won with the worst score so far this time. All of my heroes had max number of wounds possible on them.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] What contributed to my wins this time was a slight change in my strategy and a little bit of luck (no orc horn blowers in both attempts - they were discarded as shadow cards). My "new" strategy is two move through stage one slower so that I am in a position to end stage two of the quest in at most two round. This requires a slower progress on stage one (several times in my second try this time I have not used the Legolas ability)

I can see that my deck is fairly effective against this scenario I really see cards that I am not glad to have drawn (maybe I might get rid of the armor for Gimli and replace it with stronger/more expensive tactics ally).

Monkeyrama, thanks for your replay. I was actually amazed by the fact that not so many players complained about this scenario difficulty, so thanks for stepping up and saying that you had similar experience. I can see now that indeed DR=3 might be correct for two players. Thank you also for the hint with Thalin/Gondor spearman combo - it is a very good one. I am using Swift Strike for the some reason but since I have only two copies of it available it is not so reliable and what is worst it is one time use only while your combo seems to have a possibility of working every round.

## 57 [player543086 on November 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65376-wojos-beyond100-plays-challenge-comments-update-the-redhorn-gate-conclusion/?do=findComment&comment=723236)

Scenario played: The seventh level
Date: 14 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Thalin (tactics/spirit)
Played 3 times - lost twice, won once (beat my worst score :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] I was abut to play the game with my recently successful deck but since this time I had my cards handy I decided to try replacing Legolas with Thalin. I attached the Book of M. to him so he can be committed to the quest and still be able to act as a defender. Losses were due to enemies swarming and location(!) lock. In all three games I faced trolls coming in close succession (twice it was round after round so I guess my shuffling was not throughout enough). I made small adjustments to my deck each time (getting rid of the armor, blade of Gondolin and replacing them with Veteran Axehand and Dwarrowdelf Axe). I felt confident that my deck is ready but still I lost twice. Here are some things that work great:
- Thalin and Gondorian spearman is an auto-kill for most of the enemies that come from the encounter deck (bypassing the shadow effect which is very important)
- One troll is not a great threat by itself although I usually need to sacrifice a strong ally (Winged Guardian all Gandalf) and powerful event (feint, quick strike etc.)
- Thalin auto-kill on Goblin archers.
Here are some things that were not great:
- Two troll is the row are also manageable most of the time but it cost me too much and if shadow effects are though I am left too vulnerable.
- Not enough shadow cancel (although I fell I have many ways, auto-kill combo as above, swift strike, hasty stroke … would love to have burning brand somehow)
- Thalin can't attack because of the book (although I need him committed to the quest anyway) this means that faint becomes waker then with Legolas as I am loosing some attack power.
- Not enough quest power to quickly go through stage two (here the loss of Legolas was visible and allowed for location lock once)
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] I hate this scenario for its random nature but I love the way it challenges me to optimize my deck to the last single card. On the other hand I can see that as far as mechanics go this quest is fairly weak and only its challenging nature keeps me trying to beat it. As I see it now if I find a deck with over 50% win percentage I will put this quest to rest and do not expect to return to it any time soon.

Having said that I am loving the fact that I get to play with so many new cards (tactics mostly) and said goodbye (for now) to few favorite but overused (Sneak attack, Steward of Gondor, The Galadhrim's Greeting etc.)

One more thing that I like is that now fighting feels very tactical. There usually few ways to deal with a given enemy (enemies) and you need a little bit of planing and some thinking on how to do it in oreder to be ready for later.

Scenario played: The seventh level
Date: 14 Nov 2012 (it is hard to keep the dates stright)
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Thalin (tactics/spirit)
Played 2 times - won twice
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] After last games I made two adjustments got rid of Stand up and Fight and Dwarrowdelf Axe and added Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Escort from Edoras. First choice was to add more expensive tactics allies as in several games I saw this resources pilling up on the heroes and I like the versatility of EoftMM as they can both quest and fight well (their response might be also interesting but my deck comes with 9 eagles cards in total so I am not counting on it much). Escort from Edoras was added mainly to push through stage two fast.
- First play was a fairly straightforward win although early troll did make me go slower than I would like.
- In the second play I've drawn Goblin Archer as a setup card (very unlucky draw for my deck as otherwise those guys die from Thalin's ability). This constant +2 threat lead to a location lock (augmented by annoying goblin scout) that almost killed me but with the help of Escort from Edoras and all my questing characters I was able to brake it. I lost a lot of time though and threat was a real danger but strong questing power (timely Gandalf helped) allowed me to get through stage 2 fast.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] I think I've finally found a deck that I am satisfied with. Of course random nature of this quest will still lead to losses but I am quite confident that I can win more then 50% of the time now. I will play some more to confirm that but expect reports from the next scenario (Flight from Moria) soon.

All in all my final opinion on this quest is settling on a positive one. Yeah, it is random, non very well balanced and the story it tells is not an engaging one but it forced complete redesign of my deck which is a great thing, it allowed me to see and use so many cards that "were collecting dust" in the box, revisit heroes that I have not seen since playing with core set alone. New challenge is next to new stories and exciting games is something that I look very much in each new adventure pack so even if those other elements are missing I am still happy with how this scenario turned out after all.

Scenario played: The seventh level
Date: 18 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Thalin (tactics/spirit)
Played 4 times - lost twice, won twice
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] First defeat was caused by the second troll coming before I was able to deal with the first one (actually other enemies slowed me down with killing the first troll). This was too much to handle and my heroes were defeated. In the second attempt treacheries had their way with me and the troll sealed my fate. Three of my allies were discarded due to treacheries and in that final one was discarded when defending the troll (which meant auto-kill on one of the heroes). I decided to play for a while (as troll did go down after that) but when unexpected courage of Gimli was discarded on another treachery I knew I was going down.

As for successful attempts there was not much to them. I got my deck going and even orc horn blower was unable to stop me although it did slow me down on my second attempt.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] I know I am running in circles with a rating on this scenario and I think it will stay like this the end. This time I was dissatisfied with my plays. It feels that after all this deck optimization it still all goes down to how encounter deck is treating me - if it trows its best at me then I am toasted and if not the games are quite boring. I am glad that I am happy with all my draws and rarely I see a card that I feel is a waste at this time this means that the deck is as good as I can do for now.

If I put all this thoughts about The Seventh level scenario together I am coming up with an average score. The thing is that its best quality is that is first combat intensive one that forced me to rethink my strategy but I am fully expecting it to be overshadowed soon by another scenario that will do it much better and in a less random way.

This brings me to a more general observation about gaming (and even beyond): If a game (scenario, movie etc.) brings something new to the table (be it mechanics, felling, story) it will capture your attention for sure but after all the fact whether it is well executed will decide if it will stay and be enjoyed for longer time and be considered seminal or be replaced/forgotten.

--------------------------------------------------------------
[Local] Noting new to report here. During first play I had an excellent draws and was sure that I can win and I did. I was a bit disappointed that I was unable to beat my high score (actually it was way worse, I must have spent too much time in stage one). In the second case I had a terrible draw (too many spirit cards). I had a tense moment when defender designed to absorb troll's attack was discarded by a shadow effect I had to kill two additional allies to soften the blow before soaking damage to Gimli. Despite that I was able to kill the troll and go on and win in the end.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General] Nothing new about the scenario so I will go on and present a mini review of FFG's deck boxes in a separate thread.

Scenario played: Flight from Moria
Date: 20 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Thalin (tactics/spirit)
Played 8 times - won 4, lost 4
--------------------------------------------------------------
[session Report] I will be brief this time as I played it so many times that the details of each play are a bit hazy.
- First play was an excellent experience (probably the best with this scenario). I didn't look through the cards earlier and assumed that I need to collect several victory points before finding an exit. This approach lead to enormous threat from Nameless Fear. Slowly though I was progressing forward (many due to several spirit allies) and finally found one possible exit (prisoned by shadow) but I didn't like the risk of being eliminated with just one card flip so I decided to carry on. Next quest card called for tools (that I found nearly at the start). At this time the troll showed up and killing him required all the attention from Gimli (he was carrying the tools). Next three threat from the staging area was too much (especially that Gimli had to stay ready to dig). Soon enough I died because of threat overdose.
- In second play I knew what to expect. I started to bypass quest cards (but not all yet as I wasn't sure if I saw all of them). This time it took me too much time to find the tools and in the mean time got location locked.
- First win after that assured me that only complete avoidance of stage completion is a key in this scenario.
- Another win was more interesting as I was able to do it despite Thalin falling down due to shadow effect that discarded an ally defender. Unexpected Courage on Gimli worked miracles.
- Lost again, very quickly. Troll plus nasty treacheries killed my by turn 4 or so.
- Won. Had a bit of bad luck with treachery making me to reshuffle the quest cards when I had tolls and was on the last stage digging. Unexpected courage on Gimli with tools made the end stage fairly easy when I got to it again.
- Lost swamped by the enemies this time. Shadow effects are much less frequent here then in The 7th level but if you are unlucky it is possible to get a string of enemies spawning new ones faster than you can deal with them. That is what happened to me this time.
- Won with an excellent score. Fairly quickly found tools and Gimli with an unexpected courage was able to smash through a wall in no time.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General thoughts] Oh man … after first play I was about to say that this is the best scenario ever. It is very good but I am disappointed by the missed opportunity to make it outstanding. So what went wrong in my opinion:
- There is absolutely no reason to gain victory points in this scenario - in fact you are severely punished for doing that. Ok, you need to bypass completing quest cards but you were unlucky enough to face Giant Troll Cave and killed it … guess what nameless fear is 3 points more powerful.
- The second possibility to win (blocked by shadow) is so totally random (especially solo) with flipping the card to check if you are eliminated that I personally will never use it. At the same time if you are lucky you can finish the scenario in two turns easily if its the first Stage 2 card to appear and you just go for it for fun. Yeah it might be interesting as a last ditch effort, all or nothing type of option with hearos almost dead but as it stands it does not work this way.

Looking at those two drawbacks it is so easy to see other option that would make this scenario more thematic and interesting. How about requiring the player to have at least 6VPs to be able to use blocked by shadow exit instead of a card flip (you traveled far and long so you luckily found an exit finally) this mechanic would introduce two strategies against the scenario - either avoid VPs totally and go for tools or collect VPs and try to survive increasing threat from Nameless Fear to somehow sneak by it and escape. I am afraid that this scenario was slight underdeveloped towards the end of its design.

I will write some more about good things about the scenario next time.

## 62 [player543086 on November 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65376-wojos-beyond100-plays-challenge-comments-update-the-redhorn-gate-conclusion/?do=findComment&comment=726967)

Scenario played: Flight from Moria
Date: 21 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Thalin (tactics/spirit)
Played 2 times, won both.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[session Report] Both wins were quite easy with no real danger of loosing in any of them.
- During first play I was severely slowed down by two Shadows of Fear treacheries coming up one after the other. First one hurt a little bit (consumed 3 resources) but the second one costed me three turns as I had to put it on Gimli that was carrying the tools.
- Second started as one of the luckiest one (tools came as a first card from the encounter deck) and soon I was able to find Escape from Darkness right after this. I was not able to beat my high score though as digging without unexpected courage is much slower (although it was worse only by two points in the end due to Gandalf showing up twice and reducing the threat quite a bit).
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General thoughts] So last time I complained that Flight from Moria missed opportunities to become one of the best scenario out there but still claimed to like it. So let me iterate why:

- Thematic feel. I love turning the next quest stage at the beginning of quest phase. Yeah it is random, you can't plan for it but the thematic feel makes up for it big time. You are running away from the mines. You do not have time to scout you just press on and change the way on the fly if needed.
- How many of the  treacheries work well in the story context. I saw some of them before but now they are not only more dangerous (like removing progress tokens from a quest card that you were digging through for the past 3 turns) but make sense (you caused the ceiling to collapse with your tools and need to start over).
- The increasing threat from the staging area is an excellent idea. Nameless Fear is slowly approaching reaching its full deadly potential with every turn.
- The fact that you do not fight Nameless fear just trying to get away from it makes sense and its thrilling (although I doesn't feel as much as frantic run in Return to Mirkwood.
- Love the idea that tools will appear not only from the encounter deck but that stage cards brings them in - gives the search more intense and interesting feel that random draw as per athelas in A Journey to Rosghobel.
- Like the idea of bypassing quest cards as an option (although it would be great to loose some benefit by doing that for now in most cases it is a trivial decision in most cases).
- Its drawbacks sparked an interest in me to fix it. My custom redesign creative juices are flowing we shall see if I can come up with something good here.

I am really eager to check the first scenario from Dwarrowdelf cycle but I am tempted to prepare my own variant for Flight from Moria so we shall see what session reports will bring next time.

## 63 [player543086 on November 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65376-wojos-beyond100-plays-challenge-comments-update-the-redhorn-gate-conclusion/?do=findComment&comment=728238)

Scenario played: modified Flight from Moria
Date: 24&25 Nov 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Thalin (tactics/spirit)
Played 2 (won and lost)
--------------------------------------------------------------
[Rule changes]
Players are now forced to face some of the mine dangers or explore them before they can try to escape. I also wanted to make a decision whether to bypass a stage card harder and I wanted Nameless Fear to become a more of a threat so I introduced the following :
- Each time you bypass a quest stage after the combat phase - put a progress token on Nameless Fear.
- Each time you use tools on Escape from Darkness stage put a progress token on Nameless Fear.
- When Nameless Fear has two progress tokens on him, he attacks first player (deal him a shadow card). A player is allowed to declare a defender. Note that Nameless Fear does not engage a player in order to attack and players do not get to strike back.
- Both quest card's that allow you to win (Blocked by Shadow and Escape from Darkness) now require you to have certain number of VPs (after tests I decided on 5). If you do not fulfill this requirement once you reveal this card you are forced to put it at the bottom of the quest deck and reveal a new one instead (note this is not treated as bypassing a location).
- Blocked by Shadow looses his effect that allows player to choose to draw cards to see if they are eliminated or replacing it.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[session Report] I have to say that the scenario plays much better with those changes. It requires you to collect VPs which makes questing hard. Bypassing stages is a tough choice and you need to have some allies ready to absorb attacks from Nameless Fear. I won my first attempt although it was fund and tense. In the second one I would be destroyed few times but decided to carry on and see how it will play out- finished with 53 threat.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General thoughts] Creating scenarios (or modifying in my case) is fun and creative but I do not know what it is but I get much more joy from playing official ones (even if they are weaker). I think it all comes down to components - in FFG's quest you have everything on the cards, game runs smoothly. In case of custom scenarios the components are sub standard (proxies etc) or you have to keep additional rules in your head (in my case).

NOTE: If you are interested in my version of Flight From Moria please fell free to try it out and let me know how do you like it (what works, what does not). You can also modify it as much as you want (eg.: you can make it harder by increasing VP requirement I introduced above, but I do not recommend going over 7VP - total # you can get from quest cards).

Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Gimli, Thalin (tactics/spirit)
Played 1 time, lost. 
--------------------------------------------------------------
NOTE: DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT PLAYED THIS SCENARIO! SPOILERS AHEAD. 
[session Report] I opened the new pack and went with my Moria tested deck, here is their story:

Trusty warriors supported by strong willed allies started the climb fast dispatching enemies left and right. Great smile of Arwen was inspiring heroes that gathered help and were able to enlist new member at almost every step. Things started to changes at it started to snow in the higher part of the mountains - slowly freezing cold was weighting down heroes but the support of allies was strong enough to get them close to the top. 

Here the mountains unleashed their fury, howl of snow storm sounded as if Saouron him self descended on them. Veteran warrior heroes and allies stopped, unable to carry on (they were ready to fight the mightiest trolls but not the nature itself) and soon froze to death. It takes a lot to brake the will of the dwarves but Gimli and Thalin gave in. Eowyn and remnants of the party made little progress but decided to press on hoping to pass the cursed Caradhras, counting on easier path later on. Then Eowyn was struck by Freezing Cold and knew it was all over but there was no way down for them. Few moments latter howling snow storm threw precious Arwen of the cliff … only Eowyn through her half frozen eyes witnessed her death as the rest of the party was killed by the snow assault at the same time. No one lived to tell the tale as the enemy approached to kill the lone daughter of Rohan. 
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General thoughts]

Talk about thematic experience. My team was moving fast first. Then slowly the cold started to take its toll, slowing me down. Then the real storm hit and whipped me out (together with stage 3 effect). I really, really recommend playing scenarios blind - so far the most thematic experiences I got were when playing like this. DO not read scenario spoilers, do not read discussions like this. Go in and experience it, you will not regret. Once you know the encounter deck at least a bit the feeling changes, you still get the great surprises in the way the cards come up but some sense of living through the great adventure is lost as you know what to expect. Here the tactical and strategic game begins but those moments of terror or surprise are not as powerful anymore. Do not devoid yourself of this first play marvel - this is something that is so unique to this game (so far I think only RPGs can create that in a long run). Now onto the game - I need to build the deck that can scale those mountains - and I have quite few ideas on how to do it.

[session Report] So after epic (and fantastic) failure of my Tactics/Spirit deck against Redhorn Gate I've needed new team that would be able to deal with the hazards of escorting Arwen through the Misty Mountains. I knew that I need more spirit allies in my team so I went with two heroes from this sphere I was fairly sure that I wanted at least two will power on my heroes so that made my choice limited to basically Eowyn and Frodo. The more interesting question which sphere to choose to support them. I decided against mono sphere and went with Lore just to see some more cards (I played Spirit Leadership a lot at the beginning). This choice was reinforced by the fact that Arwen's ability guaranteed a nice resource generation effectively replacing the need for Theodred. I was really debating taking the Lore Glorfindel (another strong quester) but decided to go with Denathor. His job (besides generating resources) would be to stand back, defend or peek at the cards and get rid the real nasties by putting them on the bottom of the deck. My real worries was the attacking ability of my team - defending was easy and heroes could take care of it but slaying even those wimpy enemies might be hard to kill but I decided to see that in practice.

First try started quite hard - Mountain Warg was drawn at setup and I knew killing him would be very hard with him returning to the staging area. For now though my threat was low enough so I let him sit in the staging area. I was happy to see Unexpected Courage in my starting hand and soon it went on Denathor (so he can look ahead and protect me from troubles). This was a blessing, in fact I soon had another copy of this card on Denathor and he often had to use his ability 3 times to get rid of powerful enemies and/or nasty treacheries. My progress was very slow but I also had Northern Tracker and was planing on getting rid of Caradhras from the staging area using his ability. It took a long time (and Gandalf had to kill the Warg) but I did it. I expected easy victory at that point. Just to be sure I've red the text on quest 2B and realized that the mountain had to be scaled again (the quest effect forced to put it in play again). Denathor had his hands full to keep the dangers at bay, Gandalf had to help with questing and slowly but surely I was able to traverse the Caradhras. Final score was almost 200 and my threat was above 40 but the team manged to get to the other side of the Mountains.

In the second attempt my deck was less generous (at least with Unexpected Courage although I had Rumors of the Earth and Riversong allay to save Denathor's ability for crucial things). I lingered at the base of the mountain and was able to draw a very decent hand of cards and had quite few allies in play. My plan was to put several progress tokens (Northern Tracker again) on Cardahas, go the 3 stage and finish it off next turn. It was foiled by a treachery that was unable to postpone with Denathor (after he got rid of a Warg) and all progress tokens in play were removed. After that I decided to finish the game without any tricks. Progress was decent although still several turns were still ahead of me. I decided to let a mountain goblin to appear thinking that now that several allies do not quest I can dispatch him easily. I need two turns to kill him. First attack was deflected but I had to burn Hasty Stokre to cancel shadow effect. Next time he attacked shadow effect discarded Denathor from play. I've thought that this is it. My hand was full of Lore cards (only Test of Will and two Dwarven tombs were playable). I wanted to see how far I could go still, River song was used to check what to expect, I was using lore cards to fuel Eowyn ability. I used test of will 3 times (redrawing it with Dwarven Tomb). Although the troll appeared in the staging area I knew I had two or three allies that I could use to block him while I was racing to finish. Canceling treacheries gave my just enough easy turns and I managed to win. In the end my score was not much better than previously.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General thoughts] Since reports were long this time I will only say that I enjoy this scenario very much. One note here that plays here are on the longer sitde (close to 1h per play) so I will not finish it as fast as Moria scenarios.

Date: 1 Dec 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Denathor (spirit/lore)
Played 3 times - lost once, won twice
--------------------------------------------------------------
[session Report] I decided to test my deck further to see if it really that good against the Gate.
- I lost my first try but in a sense in solidify my assumption that the deck is quite good. Enemies were my doom this time. They started attacking a bit to early and once Denathor was wounded I had to start using Frodo to convert wounds to threat. Slowly I was able to take control of the satiation but the threat was too high already (few untimely shadow effects increased the threat by quite a lot - I made a mistake of not using the Forest Snare early enough as I preferred more allies). After that the slow increase of threat pushed me over 50 before I was able to get to stage 3. I was glad that I could deal with enemies nevertheless as fighting is a weak spot of my deck.
- Second try was interesting as I almost become location locked. Timely Escort from Edoras followed by Gandalf questing broke me free (together with Denathor control over encounter deck) and I was able to finish the quest with a decent score.
- Third try was an easiest so far. I lingered at the base of the mountains through (using Northern Tracker to put 7 progress tokens on Caradhras). This resulted in a similar score to the one during second try.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General thoughts] The deck I am playing is weak! How can I say that after reporting 4th win with it? Well it is build strictly for this scenario an it relies heavily on Arwen generating tons of additional Lore resources. Without her my hand would be overflown with expensive, unplayable lore cards. I have a great admiration for people that are able to construct one deck to rule them all - I am more of a deck against a scenario kind of player.

 

NOTE: I am in the process of transfering my session reports and comments to a BGG blog. I've realized that thread format here is quite cumbersome and not very relevant. I am planning to update this thread for a little longer (say two weeks) before officialy announcing its retireement.

Scenario played: Redhorn Gate
Date: Dec 2012
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Denathor (spirit/lore)
Played 1 time - won
--------------------------------------------------------------
[session Report] I was disappointed seeing Mountain Troll as a setup card. Fortunately my starting threat is low (24) and my staring hand contained West Road Traveller and she would be able to balance troll generated threat. Denethor got rid of Warg and I've drawn Celebdil. It is a bit annoying as an active location with its progress removal ability but I could not afford to let it sit in stagging. Progress was slow but with two unexpected courages coming out of my deck Denethor ability allowed me to control encounter deck and avoid location lock. Enemies were also less dangerous once I had burning brand on him. Finally I had to engage troll and I was forced to let one ally die to stop his attack - what a disaster - a shadow that discarded two lore resources that were saved up to play forest snare next turn. Next attack had to be stopped using Frodo ability and my threat went up into 40's. After that the troll was snared and ceased to be dangerous. Slowly but surely I finished the quest after that.
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General thoughts] One interesting side effect of Denethor put it on the bottom of the encounter deck ability - if the game last long enough this accumulated terrible cards will start showing up again - and even two unexpected courage on him might not save you from that. Luckily there is a shift of focus between start of the game and towards the end - many of the encounter cards that are deadly at the start of the game (and hence go on the bottom of the deck) are not that dangerous once your fellowship is stronger and/or staging area is clear.

Scenario played: The Redhorn Gate
Date: 7 Dec 2012 
Heroes (spheres): Eowyn, Frodo, Denathor (spirit/lore)
Played 3 times - won 3
--------------------------------------------------------------
[session Report] I will not be able to provide full session report this time as it took me few days to post it and I forgot most of the details by now. I won all of the attempts
- One time I was assaulted by enemies and almost got overwhelmed (Frodo's ability to convert damage to threat was essential to my survival). Once I got things under control it was much better. 
- I finally encountered the location that puts all locations back into encounter deck and provided that you traveled far enough it reduces your threat by 11. It was fun and annoying at the same time. Would love to see more of this in the deck with an option of exploring it via threat rise (ala Zigil Shaft). Would make decision to travel there interesting one.
- I finally had to dig through the encounter deck to find enough VPs to win. So far I always seemed to find VP peaks early in the game so it was interesting change (I was using Denethor just to speed up the process).  
--------------------------------------------------------------
[General thoughts] So let me sum up my opinions of The Redhorn Gate. The first attempt was epic, tense failure - going blind into this scenario is the way to go. The tale of freezing cold, un-traversable peaks and dread of weather was so strong that I almost could feel the chill myself. Scenario stayed strong after that but my choice of heroes (Denethor) softened the blows like a good coat that isolates you from the cold. 
 
Strength of the scenario comes from its increasing difficulty. It starts fairly easy (although the Caradhras looming over your head can be though), then the wind picks up and at first it just seems to slow you down. Only when you enter the third stage it turns deadly. The only gripe I have with it is that once you explore Caradhras it gets much easier. It does tell the story right (as once you go over the pass, slowly the road gets easier) but looses a bit of it climatic edge. 
 
After all I like it very much, with the strong points being that narrative feel, hat great stories of group of adventures fighting against the wrath of mountains. At this point I it is in my top 5:
1. Journey down the Anduin
2. Return to Mirkwood
3. Massing at Osgiliath
4. The Redhorn Gate 
5. A Journey to Rhosgobel
