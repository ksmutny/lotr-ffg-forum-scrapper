Hi guys, sorry if this has been asked before.

I'm wondering how many core sets are needed for this game.  I know for the other LCGs, like Cthulhu, you end up needing three copies to get x3 of each card.  Is LOTR the same way?

Thanks!

You get three of some cards but only 1 or 2 of others!

 

Every one is different, i personally just have 1 and think its fine, s lot of people have more. I guess getting one to start and seeing how you get on is your best bet!

Sounds good, thank you!

I'd definitely recommend getting at least two core sets. There are a lot of useful cards that only come as one copy per core set. If you're really dedicated you could get three, but I get by fine with two.

 I think the difference is the competitive field. As has been said, some of the best cards are in the core set in single copies. For a PvP game like Warhammer or A Game of Thrones, you need those extra core set cards in order to win. If you're playing LotR solo, you can skip the second core set. If you plan on competing in a house tournament or the online tournaments and are super competitive, it may be worth it for you. Many of us have trouble keeping up with the expansions and adventure packs as it stands and would rather get new stuff than the 56 or so extra cards you'll be able to use from a second core set. I still haven't bought Khazad-Dum or any of the Dwarrowdelf packs, and with the announcement of The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill, it's looking less and less likely that I'll ever purchase a second core set.

I have 2 core set but i agree is not really necessary.Yes get one more U courage and additional sneak attack +Dwarfen tomb is cool but you can play without for sure.

One is enough and probably more fun, if you love a challenge.

If only I had a Core Set for every time this question was posted... gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Kidding badash56. Welcome to the site.

That was one of my first questions when I got into the game too.

I ended up getting a second core set, and I don't regret it. But, I played with just one for a while at first.

I'd say, go with one for a while. Make sure you love the game.

When you find out that you do, if you really want the extra multiples (especially if you want to play with others and provide them with decks), then adding is worth it.

Enjoy!

However - as always -, the more the better (unfortunately):

+) 2 Core sets open up the possibillity to use 3 copies of several good card (that come with the set only twice)

+) 3 Core sets allows you to use 3 copies of whatever card you want to use (including a couple of strong cards that are in the set only once...)

+) More that 3 core sets allow you to build more decks without the need to take them appart every time... 6 Core sets would be nice actually gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 

I have three sets now and having less would annoy me every time we lose a game. We still lose way too many games and couldn't do without the best tools (playing with 2 players most of the time)!

I strongly suggest you get only one Core set.  As you will buy more and more expansions, you should probably start having problems keeping 50 cards in your deck anyway (sooooooooooo many options!!!) and as Leptokurt wrote, you would not have the same challenge.
