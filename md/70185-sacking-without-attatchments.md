one of the sacks says attatch to character with most attachments- what if there arent any in play? does it get shuffled into the sack deck? or do you chose a character anyways?

ive read the rulesheet but the wording isnt that clear to me

thanks

If there are no attachments in play, all characters are having 0 attachment.  Since they are tied for having most attachments, the player can choose the target of Sack.  This is my opinion and I could be wrong.

the rules sheet talks about no elegible targets and it gets put back into the sack deck- so i was just wondering what situation would have no elegible targets other than if everyone was sacked…..

so im not sure……though i think you are correct

Angus is correct. For all the sack cards, if more than one eligible target has the highest referenced attribute (attachments, resources, willpower, etc.), then you must choose one of those characters to sack. In this case, ALL characters have "the most attachments" (0), so you could choose virtually any character to sack.
