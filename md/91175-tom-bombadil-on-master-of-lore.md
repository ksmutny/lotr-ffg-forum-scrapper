He is a merry fellow, but he didn't make it into Black Riders. Luckily, Beorn made a custom card so I got to write an article about him anyway!

i love bombadil- i wrote about him and his enigma on my tolkienology series that used to appear on this forum every week... very similar to your blog, however they have of course been forgotten in the mists of lotr lcg time (i dont think there is many players on here from when i was doing them).

 

one of my favourite theories i have ever heard, though not founded upon anything, is that he is the reader themselves....completely removed from middle earth.

 

anyways, i am dissapointed ffg didnt put him in, though i can only guess they are saving him for later.

I read those articles Rich! Very interesting. I especially liked your one part about Gandalf's plan to get into Mordor.
