# [[CustomScenario] A Moment to Breath (v1)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60222-customscenario-a-moment-to-breath-v1/)

Another custom quest, yes...

 

This is (yet) another of my custom quests; but this time, I haven't much time to test it because the classes begun and me and the playas aren't getting together that often. I use this as an introductory quest for new players, even though it has stuff that aren't common (like bifurcated quests and two active quests as once) I never had a player that was confused. You can also play this as if it is a continuation of Passage Through Mirkwood, making the first game longer.

Please, feedbacks!

 I like it!  It looks like a pretty good introduction to the game.

A small nit-pick, though: the word you want is "breathe", not "breath".

Oh, thank you twice!

 

As soon as I get home, I'll change it in the quest cards and update it again.

Very interesting how the choice of which "2" quest card to go to depends on what transpires during the "1" quest.  One quick question for now... For the card "I Have no Fear" it says "Place this card at the staging area with a number of tokens equal to X" and the cost of the card is "X."  When you pay the resources, do you use those resources to place on the card, or do you have to pay additional resources to put on the card?  It's not clear how it's written.  I like the concept of how that works, though.

Thanks (again). :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

The amount you paid for the action is the same number you put on the card itself.
The wording is indeed a little bit clunky, but I used the same as in Gandalf's Search (the difference being that the Search doesn't say anything about 'resource' in it's text, thus not making a confusion).

 

If you have a better way of wording that, please, tell me! (also, I say the same about the "Hero's Ambush" quest card partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif])

Hey, updated the quest cards with correct wording.
I cannot edit this topic's title, though.

 

I also did a minor expansion on the explanation of how goes this quest with 4 players.

 

 

Take a look people. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
