I just wanted to state the obvious... those nightmare decks look awesome and I will definately pick them up as soon as possible... Conflict at the Carrock is my favorite adventure thus far and I am very glad it is getting a redo in the nightmare fashion...

 

Thanks to FFG for keeeping this wonderful game going for a few years now...

 

Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to all the regulars here on the forum...

merry xmas and happy new year to you too

 

The art has been pretty fantastic on all the nightmare packs ive seen thus far and really help instill a more morbid and dreadful setting into the quests.
