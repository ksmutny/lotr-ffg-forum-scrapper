Something that came up last night on scenario two.  Do you keep piling on progress tokens onto the quest if you don't satisfy all the completion conditions?  We still had the hill troll in play on the first phase but we wanted to stack a couple more tokens on the quest in case an encounter or shadow card removed some.  We interpreted it as yes, but the rulebook isn't clear.  It just says the quest is complete as soon as enough tokens are on it.

I would say yes as nothing says you cannot. Really for most quests it will be pointless but won't hurt anything.

There are Enemy and Treachery cards that remove progress tokens so it would be to your advantage to keep track of how many extra progress tokens you have on the quest.

We also played it as they continue to stack beyond the required value in case some were removed before we completed the other objective. Seems to make sense.
