Hi there!

So Im just getting into actually playing the game and I got a couple questions.

1. Four of the 'Song' cards add a resource icon to the attached character. That doesnt mean that they get an additional resource on their turn, just that their resource now counts as either/both the original sphere and the new sphere for that Song card, right?

2. When you attach an Attachment to a character, and the Attachment has text that says 'Exhaust [attachment name] to do X', does that mean just to exhaust the Attachment or does the character it is on also get exhausted?

 

Thanks for the help! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks for the quick answers!

Also, your Tolkienology series was really good. Hope you'll continue it sometime soon.
