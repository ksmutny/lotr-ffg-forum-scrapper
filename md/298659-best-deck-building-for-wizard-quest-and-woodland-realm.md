Which are you "best" combinations of encounter cards made from these two PODs?

Right now one of my best/worst creations (depending on where you sit on the table) is based around sets 01/03/04/07/13/25/26, with quest cards from The Woodland Realms (specifically using as Stage 2 the one which gives Doomed 1 and "cannot be canceled" the first treachery and as stage 3 the one which quest points equal to the highest threat amongst the players. This encounter deck is especially nasty againts the decks we usually play in 4p so it's not necessarily the worst ever, but I think it packs quite a punch with all the exhaust and cannot ready effects (and Enchanted Stream is really killer).

I am curious to hear your ideas ðŸ˜ˆ

It's hard to go wrong with good ol' location lock. Make sure to add all those cards that return enemies to the staging area and trigger immediate attacks.

So Iâ€™ve only done random mixes to play againstÂ

Be interested to hear what you come up with adding the GenCon Moria block to the mix. Those cards by themselves were BRUTAL. Never had so much fun dying though!
