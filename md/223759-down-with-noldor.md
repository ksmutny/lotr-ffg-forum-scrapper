# [Down with Noldor!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/)

## 1 [Supertoe on June 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2287173)

So you hear people everywhere complaining that Dwarves are to strong, Dwarves got too much support, etc.

 

Dwarves got 3 big boxes and part of a cycle. That's a lot.

 

 

 

But Noldor, oh that's fine. They are okay. No problem there. I want MORE Noldor! etc. etc.

 

Noldor was the primary trait in Dwarrowdelf, despite the fact that it was suppossed to be the dwarf cycle. Four heroes!

Noldor was the primary trait in Angmar, despite the fact that it was suppossed to be the Dunedain cycle.

Now they get a big box and a whole cycle to themselves.

 

 

And yet nobody complains? Let's see some support for Gondor, Rohan, and Silvan. Maybe some Hobbits?

Personally, I'm glad that they are developing the Noldor trait more.  It seemed that Spirit Glorfindel was becoming a little underpowered and needed some new toys to boost his viability.

I hope that is sarcasm.

Erm ... have you bought the APs of this cycle? (AP not deluxe box). They have nearly no Noldor and lots of Gondor, Dale and Rohan ... some Silvan also.

But even if things where as you write, why does it bother you so? Noldor is a major faction in story of middle earth and it was underdeveloped till recently. As a Tolkien fun this really makes me happy

## 5 [Thanatopsis on June 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2287257)

Just to put some numbers around it. We're half-way through this cycle and there are four cards that focus on Noldor. Meanwhile, there have been 4 Gondor, 2 Dwarf, 3 Rohan, 2 Dale, 2 Hobbit, 6 warrior, and 6 scout cards. On top of that there are no Noldor heroes in this cycle and no spoiled card in the last three APs with the Noldor trait. That seems to me like an extremely balanced spread of trait development.

 

Now, the Grey Havens deluxe expansion, I'll absolutely agree that it has a dominating Noldor theme.

## 6 [GrandSpleen on June 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2287301)

Noldor's only just now fleshed out as a distinct archetype.  Noldor heroes and characters were available before, but the evolving focus on factions in this game lacked a coherent Noldor faction until late in the Angmar cycle.  

 

Anyway, it's not like we need to solicit more complaints from people.  We have plenty of that.

## 7 [PocketWraith on June 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2287303)

Noldor were not the main theme of Dwarrowdelf. Heroes do not an archetype make, not by themselves. The most consistent theme running through the Dwarrowdelf player cards was Secrecy.

Noldor got some nice things in 2/6 APs in Angmar Awakened. They were some very nice things admittedly, but not enough to outweigh the amount of Dunedain, and in general that cycle was just very well distributed between a lot of different things. Grey Havens was a Noldor box, but as I recall the news articles described it as being pretty much the capstone on the Noldor development from Angmar Awakened, and that lines up with what we've seen since - not much extra Noldor.

 

This cycle is giving boosts to all the other traits you mentioned. Also since you brought up the Dwarf comparison, while I don't have numbers on other card types, I'll mention that Dwarves still have the most heroes in the game - but by the end of the current cycle Gondor will have caught up with them. Will you then start calling "Down with Gondor!" ? Or will you accept it's a good thing that all the traits are getting some love?

But they could have developed the Woodman trait more!  There is only one Woodman card this cycle!

People like elves more than dwarves. I think it's fairly safe to say that, in general that is of course.

I like Silvan, but not Noldor more than dwarves.

Its just a fun post guys, not really meant to be serious. Just an over-the-top way of saying that I want some non-Noldor stuff.

I personally don't see an unfair influx of Noldor, especially this cycle (first pack was Gondor-Noldor, but all the others are very mixed). This is supposed to be the diversity cycle I guess, if anything Gondor seems the most pushed by the announcements. And then we'll see a new silvan hero and silvan allies and attachments in the next pack (as a lover of the classic Celeborn Galadriel Haldir deck, I wonder if Aragalad might be cool to try instead of Haldir). 

 

In any case, I do hope they veer a bit from these themes and get to artifacts lol.

You mean like what we're getting throughout this cycle?

> Or Beornings.

 

I'm still waiting for more cards with the "Encounter" keyword.  Obviously, we don't want too many, and end up flooding the encounter deck with beneficial cards, but seeing as how they made an entire keyword with rules, I figured there'd be at least a couple more follow-ups.  Maybe have a counterpart to the Ranger of the North, where instead of wanting him to show up as soon as possible, you want him to stay in the deck and be a shadow card?

 

I'm thinking give him the same stats as RotN and the same "take control when he appears" function, except instead of doing damage or progress, he would have a shadow effect.  Something along the lines of:

Shadow:  Attacking enemy has either -2 {attack} or -2{defense} until the end of the round.  Then, the first player chooses a player to take control of this card.

 

BTW, Kakita, love the mon!  ...Even if it is for the Crane...

(Just kidding, we love our honorable, dueling brethren.)

## 17 [Gizlivadi on June 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2287599)

As I always say when the Encounter keyword comes up, I think it'd be the perfect way to make Bombadil and Goldberry as player cards, if they wanted to.

Good point.  The fact that the only Encounter keyword card is also Dunedain doesn't necessarily mean the two keywords have to be tied together!  Why, we could even have an Encounter Nol- <glances at topic title>

 

...oh...nevermind.

## 19 [Kakita Shiro on June 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2287640)

Encounter Beornings. Get on it, FFG. =)

## 20 [beregrew on June 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2287645)

Personally, i think Rohan needs some more support, though theres probably gonna be more in the Flame of the West Saga though. I feel like Voice of Isengard is more based around Doomed and Saruman.  idk maybe thats just me

## 21 [JJ48 on June 29, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2287681)

Considering Beorn pretty much acted independently from Bilbo's group (hunting wargs to verify their story and shadowing them to ensure the ponies were ok), I could actually see that working out, thematically.

## 22 [Supertoe on June 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2288032)

Dale needs more support. Like actual support. A dale/Erebor cycle would be so awesome!

## 23 [soullos on June 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2288205)

Cursed elves, every time a developer sneezes a new elven sub-race is born. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

But I'm feeling a bit Noldor fatigue to be honest, but I'm not much that excited about the archetype gameplay-wise. I would gladly trade Noldor development for more support for the Encounter and Doomed keywords. Those are sorely lacking.

## 24 [Network57 on June 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2288222)

I say we get a cycle where every player card is Rohan. I want to hear people complaining about them being over-developed.

It's a co-op game, it's not like GoT where over-development of one House is bad for competition. Who cares? Don't want Noldor, don't buy Noldor.

We have gotten pretty much everything but Noldor stuff in the current cycle, I think the only new card was the healer.....

Also I disagree heartily with your statement to begin with and actually really want more Noldor cards. More that you can play from your graveyard and more that have nothing to do with the discard mechanic but have their own strong abilities.

Noldor are just so much more fun than Dwarves. In the books it is a better competition, both cultures being magically defined. In the game, Dwarves, unfortunately, are a bit boring in comparison.

## 27 [JanB on June 30, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223759-down-with-noldor/?do=findComment&comment=2288528)

Sady, that you need Noldor allies (Gildor/Stargazer) to check you deck after that you can beginn mining mit Zigil Miner or the Prospector.

Dwarfs need some more allies/abilities to look at the deck and reorder some cards.

And the defender and Glorfindel. (But all 3 of those were from the first pack, so....)

I disagree, I find it fits well with the Dwarven aesthetic. They're more concerned with "delving too greedily" than to worry about what exactly they're digging up and discarding. It makes tribal Dwarven mining decks far more exciting and dangerous, and a meta I wish got developed more to fill out more deck space.

I think the most underdeveloped concept in the game so far is different meals for hobbits.

The Hobbits only became useful once Aragorn stopped them eating all the time. Unless they're encounter cards I don't see the point.

I definitely first read this as "The Hobbits only became useful once Aragorn stopped eating them all the time," and I was all, huh, maybe it really HAS been too long since I read the books.

I first read it that way as well, despite knowing that Aragorn didn't actually eat any hobbits in the book.  Not even Bill the Pony got et.  However, I also couldn't recall Aragorn stopping them from eating all the time, nor do I recall any marked increase in competence associated with that.  (I am speaking strictly of the book, I remember the movie had a scene along that line).  The Hobbits were not constantly eating as they made their way from the Shire to Bree, and although they had plenty of unexpected help in order to get there, I think they did remarkably well under the circumstances and considering the fearsome nature of their opponents.  With Strider they endured a miserable time largely without complaint -- the major exception being this:

 

---

"I am being eaten alive!" cried Pippin.  "Midgewater!  There are more midges than water!"

 

"What do they live on when they can't get hobbit?" asked Sam, scratching his neck.

---

 

Aragorn sets them straight on one occasion prior to Weathertop, but although it involved food it was not a complaint:

 

----

The hobbits felt refreshed, as if they had had a night of unbroken sleep.  Already they were getting used to much walking on short commons--shorter at any rate than what in the Shire they would have thought barely enough to keep them on their legs.  Pippin declared that Frodo was looking twice the hobbit that he had been.

 

"Very odd," said Frodo, tightening his belt, "considering that there is actually a good deal less of me.  I hope the thinning process will not go on indefinitely, or I shall become a wraith."

 

"Do not speak of such things!" said Strider quickly, and with surprising earnestness.

----

Thinking about it further, though, it's surprising to me how often food or drink is connected to help in the text.  Consider:

 

1) Gildor Inglorion and company scare off a Black Rider in a timely fashion, then take the three hobbits with them and feed them.  Sam is mightily impressed with the apples.

 

2) Farmer Maggot gives them news and a ride to the ferry.  And dinner.  And lots of mushrooms.

 

3) Joining up with Merry and Fatty, the conspiracy is revealed and the steps taken to smuggle Frodo out of the forest.  And serves them another dinner.

 

4) Rescued from the Willow by Tom Bombadil, he brings them home and feeds them.  They spend a couple days eating and drinking.  "Long tales are thirsty, and long listening's hungry work, morning, noon and evening."

 

5) Tom rescues them again from the Barrow-wight.  He doesn't feed them again, though he does find their provision-carrying ponies for them, and recommend a good inn in Bree.

 

6) Butterbur's a bit of an exception.  He does bring them a fine dinner, but mentions that they might want to go join the company afterwards.  That didn't turn out so well, although Frodo did meet Strider there.  When Butterbur's actually helpful (bringing the letter), he only brings hot water.

 

7) Sam decks Bill Ferny with an apple.  He does think it's "a waste of a good apple", but I'll count it.

 

8) Glorfindel meets with them and helps them get to the ford -- and also produces a little liquor for each of them, which both invigorated them and helped their stale bread and dry fruit "satisfy their hunger better than many a good breakfast in the Shire had done."

 

9) Saved from the brink of death by Elrond, when Frodo awakens a great feast is ordered.

 

10) At the council of Elrond, Frodo volunteers only after Bilbo points out that it's high time they pick the messengers or break for dinner.

 

11) Galadriel and Celeborn give mighty gifts to the company, but Lembas is among the most important.  Without it Frodo and Sam could never have endured to Mount Doom.

 

12) Treebeard helps Merry and Pippin out and topples Saruman.  He also gives Merry and Pippin ent draughts.

 

13) Treebeard's sack of Isengard produces a feast for Merry and Pippin.  And pipeweed.

 

14) Gollum provides invaluable guidance in getting to Cirith Ungol.  He also provides a couple of coneys to S. Gamgee.

 

15) Foolishly cooking the coneys attracts the attention of dangerous men -- fortunately led by Faramir, who suspends the law, spares their lives, and feeds them.

 

16) Sam spills the beans to Faramir after he's filled with food and drink.  Faramir gives them counsel, staves, and food and water for the road.

 

17) Merry first is in the same conversation with Eowyn at a feast, though the food may not have been ordered by Eowyn herself.  Eowyn confines herself to giving Merry rainment of war, so she's a bit of an exception.

 

18) Beregond, on the other hand, gets food for Pippin on their first meeting, and later brings him to meet his company, who "gave him as much food and ale as he could wish."

 

19) Sam wishes the Lady Galadriel could give him sunlight and clean water.  And gets it.

 

20) The rescue of Frodo and Sam by Gandalf and the Eagles was not directly associated with food, although they do get a light meal fed to them directly before proceeding to the Field of Cormallen.

 

All in all, I'd have to say that food has positive connotations in LOTR, and the player card "A Good Meal" is a good thematic fit.  Having an encounter card that punishes the party for the Hobbit's joy of the table would be a poor fit for the text, I think.
