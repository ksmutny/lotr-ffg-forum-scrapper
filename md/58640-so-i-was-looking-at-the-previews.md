and i saw boots from erebor...0 cost. seems a bit random, maybe ive missed soemthing but why would something so useful be free? nothing in this life is free, is there a subtle part in khazad that makes this free for a reason?

The real cost is a card in your deck. It also only goes on Dwarves and Hobbits, and you can only attach one copy of the boots to a character. And let's be honest, 1 HP isn't that big of a deal; 1 point of defense would be more useful. I'm not saying the card is bad, but it's not that great, either.

 1 extra hit point could make a massive amount of difference - shame it's dwarves and hobbits only.

something to give a Silvan character 1 extra hit point could be incredibly useful -Silvan Tracker suddenly works to heal your daughter of the nimrodel who stays around long enough to get healed, rather than being taken out by a single necromancer's reach, and in turn provides continued all-round healing for your heroes.

Also, if you've got attachment recursion, this could increase the effectiveness of chump-blocking a hill-troll, or some other card where excess damage matters.

Makes powering up gimli a bit easier- much cheaper than the 4 for citadel plate in a multi-sphere deck

i agree that they arent really really useful, i just would expect the to cost at least 1....theres a preview in the upcoming packs of RING MAIL, cost 2, and it looks to add +1 hit point also

I thought so at first, too.  But when my son and I took a closer look, we think it might be +1 [shield icon], which would be much better.  Put Ring Mail on a dwarf that already has 3 toughness, and you have yourself quite a blocker.  Add on a few Dunadain Warnings, and your Dwarf could be up to 7 defense/toughness!

on a related point ive noticed Khazad! khazad! is also free....+3 attack for free, dont get me wrong i aint complaining about any of this, im just trying to get my head round the reasons for this

Weak effect + cheap cost = average card.

 

Compare Khazad! to Wassal of Windlord. 

- Khazad is cheaper by 1 but both are very cheap

- Wassal can block. This may be a difference between death and life

- Both can be used to bump attack by 3

- Wassal can be used in every tactic deck, while Khazad can be used only in tactic dwarven deck

- Wassal can quest (think about Faramir or about making a shield for Eowyn so orc damage will not hit her)

- Minor synergies like Radagast or other eagle cards

 

If Khazad! costed 1 , I would not consider playing it right now. Being free makes this card worth thinking about.

thanks i never thought of it that way....i always tend to see them on face value such as wow! +3 attack for nothing.....when yes, an ally that has 3 attack is much more useful and worth having in the deck.....though khazad khazad still looks a tasty card in a dwarf deck of course
