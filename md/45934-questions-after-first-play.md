Awesome game.  The one thing I would like to see is "neutral" Encounters that could be added to any Encounter set to allow players to vary and tweak the Encounter Deck.

 

2 questions:  If a character is exhausted, are the attachments exhausted as well.  For example, I was thinking of Self_Preservation, if it can remain Ready even if attached to a Hero who is exhausted?

I assume when a Shadow Card is drawn, the instructions above the shadow line are ignored and only the instructions below the shadow line are put into play?

Attachments and characters exhaust separately unless the card effect says to exhaust both.

That is correct. Only Shadow effects happen.

Thanks, everyone.  I appreciate the quick responses.

 

Thank God about the shadow effects--I'd hate for the whole card to come into effect as well in many cases!
