# [Just got an overall score of a 26 defeating quest 2!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49048-just-got-an-overall-score-of-a-26-defeating-quest-2/)

 Quest 2 has been giving me some trouble for quite sometime until I finally just tried mixing 3 spheres...it kicked butt on the first round!  I mixed Spirit (Eowyn), Lore(Beravor), and Leadership (Gloin). These cards work extremely well together, threat removal is provided by Spirit along with high willpower; card drawing is provided by lore as well as ample healing; and lastly, Leadership provides most obviously, resource production. This deck is dicey because it depends on 3 spheres and once a character dies, you are stuck with a ton of cards you can't use.  The up side is the deck gives you everything you need to defeat quest 2 more consistently than any other combination I have tried; plus, most of the cards I chose to include in the deck are low costing resource thus allowing me to play cards quicker.  Try this deck out and let me know what you think Tolkien fans!

Spirit/Lore/Leadership iswhat I'm currently running, but with Eowyn, denethor and Theodred right now. Very low starting threat, which is nice against the Troll. I found that the deck won when I got a lot of allies out, and lost if I couldn't.

So I've taken that to its logical extreme, by now including every ally from those 3 spheres in the deck. With 3 Gandalfs, that's 34 allies I believe. Added in 16 other cards to make the 50 and will play it for the ifrst time later this week. Obviously it won't work against Dol Guldur, but I have high hopes for Anduin.

Try Dunhere, Eowyn, Legolas. If you can, include the new Song of Kings and Dunedain Mark (plus any other Leadership card you'd find most fit - but never too many). I am, of course, not sure whether this is the best solo deck but so far, out of many tries, it has been surely most fun to play with. Dunhere and Legolas are apt assassins whilst Eowyn does all the questing. If you get Unexpected Courage, always place it on Dunhere so you can target more than 1 enemy from the staging area, or one more than once. Once in a while, either of the two can help you quest so that Eowyn does not get all the negative effects, aka Necromancer's Reach or Dol Guldur Orc Bastards. Surely include Northern Tracker and never travel. I am sure you'd know all this but just for the record, take Tactics aces like Feint and Blade of Gondolin but also those not so famous as Blade Mastery or Quick Strike. Befriend Beorn also, he is most great with Quick Strike. If you include Sneak Attack (from the Leadership cards provided via Song of Kings) and Stand and Fight, you will have three different choices how to get Beorn into play. And once you do, you'll be glad you have.

guys, are you all talking about solo play? With 3 spheres, i assume so, right? Would a 3-sphere deck make sense in a 2-player game at all?

Cheers,

Depends. I could imagine a 2 player game with a pure tactics player and a mixed player who combines spirit and lore and implements leadership for the Steward and Sneak Atack. Could be worth a try :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
