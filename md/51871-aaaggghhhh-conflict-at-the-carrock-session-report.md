# [AAAGGGHHHH!!! (Conflict at the Carrock Session Report)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51871-aaaggghhhh-conflict-at-the-carrock-session-report/)

Our first 3-player attempt at conflcit at the Carrock. I was running a Spirit deck with a smattering of Leadership Cards (including song of Kings) a friend was running a straight tactics deck, and my wife was running lore (with 1x song of kings, and Minstrells to pull it out.)

Two of us had tried the quest before, so we were careful to start slowly, not overcommitting to questing. We managed to get plenty of allies out, and amass some resources. Frodo was briefly sacked, but the miner of the iron hills freed him. We found Grimbeorn thanks to a Bee Pasture and used Oakwood grove to bring him into play, as well as a Steward of Gondor, and a few Dunedain marks/warnings.

Despite my deck having been given lots of extra card draw from Lore, there were no Northern Trackers to be seen, and the locations were starting to pile up in the staging area. Probably 10 threat worth by the time we finished stage 1. but plenty of characters so managing to at least break even. We'd also managed to keep threat low - low-mid 30s thanks to Gandalf and hte Galadhrim's greeting, recylced with Born aloft and dwarven tomb respectively.

Managed to take the trolls a few at a time, although annoyingly got a hill troll rocking up to join the party. Having the carrock as the active location got the staging area even more clogged up as we were no longer getting progress tokens for blade of Gondolin.

Managed to kill the hill troll and 3 of the named four. Threats were 32, 34 and 35. The remainging troll was forest snared, and we had a large pile of victory point cards, all that remained was to kill off the last one.

Questing: yet another lcoation brings us up to 13 threat in the staging area, then two treachery cards - Massing at Night (3 additional encounter cards.) and A Frightened Beast - (raise threat by total of staging area) we used Eleanor to cancel a Frightened beast, and dealt the extra cards, another 2 worth of threat, and then A frightened beast again! suddenly our threats were 50, 47, and 49. Lore was dead leaving us well short on the questing, and even discarding my entire hand couldn't stop the remaining two of us from being threatened out

Good scoring (imminent) victory to defeat in less than a minute!

Sound Very cool!!! The game is hard!!! I like this!!! I will get it on the next week. Still play Massing in Osgiliath also very brutal and difficult quest.

Good stuff. It's amazing how those treachery cards live up to their name. Just rollin' along, minding your own business on your quest and then BLAMO! treachery strikes!

I tried Carrock once so far on my own just to get a sense of how it plays out and I got thumped.

 I just picked up Conflict as Carrock today. I did play a game today, but it was with two players who were new, but we went with Journey Down the Anduin as I didn't want to scare them off.
