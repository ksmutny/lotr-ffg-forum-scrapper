If you complete 1 or more locations in the staging area during a quest using Northern Tracker (Response: After Northern Tracker commits to a quest, place 1 progress token on each location in the staging area.) as an example, do you fulfill the explore conditions of each location completed?  Or do you only fulfill the explore conditions if the location is the current active location?  It just doesn't make much sense in the context of the story that you've just explored a bunch of locations without even travelling to that location.

Thanks,

Kirk

the moment ANY location has the same amount of tokens as is required it is explored and discarded

it actually makes alot of sense thematically - think of it as the northern tracker is out scouting the wilds while your heros are in one place :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I was wondering about this too, figured as much though. Thanks for the answer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
