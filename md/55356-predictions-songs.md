I just wanted to make a couple predictions and see what other people think will be in the future for this game. 

I believe the "songs" cards are going to be very sought after.  I would say valuable, but im not sure how individual card values work in this style of game.  i love these cards, hey are extremely useful, especially since they run on any resourse type and are cheap.  Being able to change resourse generation so easy, is fantastic and powerful. These cards give options.....whole deckbuilding options.

I imagine at some point we will see heroes in the future that actually have 2 resource icons to start.

Songs being powerful is not a prediction its a fact.

I like your second prediction of a multi-sphere character. I think that is highly likely. Similar to a multi-house character in AGOT

Barliman Butterbur or whatever that innkeep's name was at the Prancing Pony will probably be all four spheres. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

He is a good source for gossip (Lore).

He shows some Spirit by just managing to hold it together when things start to get crazy.

The movies portrayed him as a bit of a coward when the Nazgul show up but we all know that if one had shown up in the books he would have punched them right in the mouth. (Tactics)

He orders those two hobbits that work for him around. (Leadership)

I can't predict what his stats or ability/ies would be but I can predict they'll be game breaking.

Well he runs a lucrative business so he should be able to generate extra resources.

He helps people get a good night's rest, so he'll allow other characters to ready.

The Prancing Pony was where they were supposed to meet Gandalf, so he'll let you search your deck for a copy of him.

Funny, and spot on.

I'd love to see Barliman Butterbur (you spelled it right) in this game. If he appears, he'll likely be an objective though.

Off topic, how about Prancing Pony as a location, spend 1 resource from a hero's resource pool to ready that hero (while the location is active).

If there's ever an adventure set in Breeland, I think that would be a great location.
