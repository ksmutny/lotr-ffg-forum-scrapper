Escape Tests take place at the end of the Quest Phase, but are they still part of the Quest Phase, or in some limbo between the Quest and Travel phases.

Reason being - I use Frodo to Quest and boost his Willpower +2 using Protector of Lorien.  I then ready him using Fast Hitch or Unexpected Courage.  Can he still use that +2 Willpower in the Escape Test?

mmmmm.....it says at the END of the quest phase, implying that it is still part of the quest phase, so i would say yes, though admittedly ive never really seen it that way till now- maybe im wrong and someone has a more informed opinion

if you quest with frodo you can, but to also use him in the escape test you need to untap him first. Protector can be used as many times as you like... So you can quest for 2+discard - use fast hitch to untap then escape test for 2 + discard... this is all legal.

Yes, I mentioned this is with Fast Hitch or Unexpected Courage.  But my question is whether discarding, for example 2 cards at the start of the Quest phase, will give Frodo +2 Willpower for both Questing and the Escape test - without having to discard a further two cards for the Escape Test.

"Protector of Lorien

Attach to a hero.
Action: Discard a card from your hand to give attached hero +1 Defense or +1 Willpower until the end of the

--== PHASE ==--."
 

The escape test is at the end of the quest phase, but before the travel phase, so the discard that boosts will on the hero is still active at the time of the escape test.

You have stumbled across the combo my friend... UC/FH + PoL is the best solution for escape tests, especially considering if you are a little low you can discard to get out of it.
