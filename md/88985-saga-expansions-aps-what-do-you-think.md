# [Saga expansions AP&#039;s. What do you think?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88985-saga-expansions-aps-what-do-you-think/)

EDIT: I didn't realise that this subject had been posted before (or basically the same). However no one really seemed to notise it which was a shame. So I'll credit Gizlivadi for this line of ideas and hope people will join in with their thoughts this time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 

 

This just occurred to me while posting in another thread. We got Delux expansions preluding 6 x adventure packs. Then we have the PoD special event packs. And the saga expansions. But do you think we will see som AP's that will suppliment the saga expansions? Not whole 6 pack cycles maybe but rather an AP from time to time to give som more quests following the story in the sagas? Like if we won't see the Barrow Down in the LotR saga expansions, maybe FFG would think afterwards "Hm, this might be an interesting quest after all" and then release it as an AP to supplement either the Black riders box or the full collection of saga boxes?

What do you think? A good/bad idea? Likely/not likely?

not a bad idea. i would see these coming out after the entire saga packs have finished- sort of the preludes that were being discussed the other day. these are an excellent way of ffg keeping the game going

I fully approve this thread. Superb idea, and kind of silly no one ever thought of this before.

I did, in another thread I made a while ago. Also, in one of the preview threads for BR I did propose a similar idea of extra quests compatible with the saga campaign mode to fill the gaps in the story.

I didn't know that. Do you remember the thread? It would be grand to read what others said about your ideas :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Great minds thing alike ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The idea proposed in that thread is sorta like this one, though I didn't specifically say anything about the campaign mode or the missing stuff from Black Riders, but I was certainly thinking about the Barrow downs (since we knew from the start we were not gonna get that in BR) and anything that would be missing from the saga expansions, and it certainly applies to them (the idea arose, however, as a suggestion to avoid repetition of adventures such as TWITW, S&F, etc).

 

Also check out the preview threads where I later proposed pretty much the same idea as the one in this thread, but sadly no one seemed to notice my posts  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Yea, I know how that feels. My threads never get that popular either ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] but since this is basicly the same idea as your I'll dedicate it to you in the original post upstairs :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It would be cool, almost having a "cycle" for each book; would be able to fit a lot more material in that manner.  I think the box sets make it easier to pick up and obtain for the casual crowd which was likely a big factor in their decision making

LOL that was great!! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] But shouldn't this link have it's own thread?? Think more people would see it then ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
