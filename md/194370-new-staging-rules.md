The Black Riders & The Road Darkens Saga Expansions insert this in the rules section:

 

>  
> 
>  
> 
> New Staging Rules
> When playing the scenarios in The Lord of the Rings Saga
> Expansions, players reveal encounter cards individually
> in player order during the Staging step of the Quest phase.
> Beginning with the first player, each player reveals 1
> encounter card and resolves its staging before the next player

> who revealed the card. If the revealed encounter has the
> Surge keyword, the player who revealed that card reveals an
> additional encounter card. Encounter cards with the
> Doomed X keyword still affect each player.

 

Does this mean that if I reveal an encounter card, the other players can't cancel its effects through a response? Or only that I am the single target of the effects of the encounter card and, thus, only the encounter cards with the Peril Keyword would forbid the help of the other players?

If an encounter card with Peril is revealed, the way I understand it, a player can only cancel the when revealed text for himself.  Then he passes the card on.

This is a good question, and I've actually mentioned it before.  Unfortunately it seems we don't have an official answer.

Interpretation 1: It seems that most people play that if the encounter card does not have Peril any player may cancel it or otherwise interact with it. 

 

Interpretation 2: Although, a strict reading of the rule book, to me, seems to imply no one could interact with it (regardless of whether or not it has Peril) since only you are revealing it (individually).  Technically you cannot "table talk" about cards you've seen so if you are revealing it individually the other players have not yet seen it and could not reasonably interact with it.  To me, this interpretation is bogus, though...but I'm not sure how to reconcile the rule book with my first interpretation.

If the card has been 'revealed,' everyone can see it so there's no table talk problem here (you're not 'looking' at the card, you're 'revealing' it).

 

Any player can use Responses when you reveal an encounter card.  As you say, Gandalf196, it is only the Peril keyword provides rules that prevent other players from using their cards while you resolve the staging of your own card.
