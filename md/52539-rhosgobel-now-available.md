I just noticed that A Journey to Rhosgobel is listed as "In Stock" in the FFG Store!

I am not seeing it in stock anywhere else yet though. Can't wait to get my hands on this. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, FFG says it's on sale now, including two treachery card spoilers

No other online sellers have it available yet. Could this be an early release for the FFG store as a way to boost their sales? If so, that might tick off a lot of game store owners who count on early releases to beat out amazon and borders. However, it might just be that other online sellers havn't updated their sites yet.

Just bought mine from the same Ebay seller I usually get my Warhammer packs from. Should be here, at the latest, early next week.

My local game store had it in stock today, so no need to worry about an FFG-store only release.

Lucky you! Mine says they are expecting it tomorrow so I hope that that is the case.  I was gonna ask if anyone's stores actually had it today but I guess your store did.

Could I ask who your Ebay seller is?  (You can send me a message, if you'd rather not say it in the thread).  Mine hasn't messaged me yet to say that they have it in stock sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

Try Sci-Fi Genre.  They are a good online retailer for FFG LCGs (they have a brick-and-mortar store as well).  I picked up my copy at their store today.

## 10 [Kiwina on September 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=523266)

 My local game store called me last night, so I'm picking mine up today.

## 11 [gamestar10 on September 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=523343)

Most sites say September 20th is the shipping date. However, there is a vendor on Amazon that is selling it with 10 in stock. Just ordered :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  This quest looks like it will be incredible!

 

Thanks for the heads up!

## 12 [TheLightdarker on September 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=523471)

 Looks like mine should get here on Tuesday!

...which is the same day that Space Marine comes out sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]  What's a nerd to do!

## 13 [Runner5 on September 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=523485)

 Got mine in my hands!  First play through tonight!  This one looks really fun.

## 14 [Klaen on September 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=523487)

Anyone here order their stuff via Amazon?

Aussie supliers have been 4-5 weeks behind American suppliers (Have only JUST picked up Carrock), so I have given up on going local and have gone for the Amazon option...

Was wondering how far behind general distribution in the States these guys are? At present the site says 20th Sept, but I am hoping Amazon get it in stock over the next couple of weeks.

 Hey SWhiteBoy, how big is the following at Genre? You are talking about the store in Durham NC right? I live in Raleigh. Love the game.

Yeah, I'm talking about the Durham store.  I couldn't say if there is a decent following because SFG doesn't have a freeplay cardgame night.  They only have a boardgame night, where people don't play CCG/LCG.

This doesn't mean that there isn't a following, but I can't verify it if there is.  Have you checked The Gamer's Armory in Cary?

 I was at my local gaming store today and was saddened by the lack of Rhosgobel. I asked the guy working there (the owner's son) about it and he just gave me a blank look and said he had no idea what I was talking about.  I'll try to swing by again on Wednesday.

Has anyone else ordered with Coolstuffinc.com? I always get mine shipped on the day of release. I'm not sure if they ship international though.

Sorry, I have not been following this thread. If you still care to know, it is lotusvault.

 Thanks, Titan.  I use Prunesquallor's Secret Cache through Ebay myself, and after I wrote that post to you I was able to get in touch with 'em and mine is on the way.  Tuesday, here we come!

## 22 [Titan on September 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=524375)

Yeah, normally I get it 2-3 days after ordering, depending on the time of the day I order it. But with the weekend and holiday, this one got pushed to 5. Tuesday for me too!

## 23 [Spirit Juggler on September 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=524461)

It's not available in the UK yet serio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/serio.gif] 

## 24 [Klaen on September 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=527317)

Sorry for the necro-post, but is it me or are there only like 7-8 people actually posting on here about Rhosgobel...with the majority still awaiting delivery?

How many people are still waiting on their copy?

 

Amazon still list as Sept. 20 release...although FFG have sold out over a week ago...am I missing something here?

I didn't think American logistics were this poor...

*waves accountability stick in FFG's general direction*

I want my product dammit, you can't string an addict along like this!

## 25 [marlow4 on September 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52539-rhosgobel-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=527356)

I haven't gotten my copy yet, but I didn't pre-order it either. The store I go to already sold out. They'll pull a pack off to the side for me next time they get some.

This game is either selling well or FFG is shipping it in a way that makes it appear to be selling well.

As far as I know I'm one of two people who hangs out at that store that is buying it, but that may have changed in the last month after we showed it to a few folks. Maybe next time I show up I'll have to fight people for seats.
