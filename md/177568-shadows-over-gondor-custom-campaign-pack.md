Hi all,

 

I have finished my first *real* custom expansion for LOTR LCG and am proud to present Shadows Over Gondor!  This expansion is designed to take the scenarios from Heirs of Numenor, the Against the Shadow cycle, and The Massing at Osgiliath and put them together into one campaign mode adventure.

 

The materials for Shadows Over Gondor can be found at this link:

https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9xWxXaUn36WfmNXNXYwMEZNZXl5RGdPMUVSSHEzaXdaSHF0cDVrYTZ5bEI5NVFyVE11XzA&authuser=0 [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9xWxXaUn36WfmNXNXYwMEZNZXl5RGdPMUVSSHEzaXdaSHF0cDVrYTZ5bEI5NVFyVE11XzA&authuser=0]

It's on Google Drive, and you don't need a Google account to view and download the set.

 

All comments and constructive criticism is welcome so I can make my custom cards better!

 

Here is an overview of the expansion and the changes it makes to the scenarios:

 

 

 

Peril in Pelargir

 * New Alcaron’s Scroll boon provides extra incentive to hold onto the message
 * Flavor text and a burden tie this adventure into Alcaron’s story more closely

 

Into Ithilien

 * Alcaron’s Scroll boon remains with players throughout Ithilien
 * Rangers join your cause if you help them defeat giant Mumakil
 * Players are punished for cowardice (aka failure to defeat Mumakil)
 * Celador travels with you past Ithilien if he survives

 

The Siege of Cair Andros

 * Boons are earned by exploring Battleground locations
 * A Burden deck like Flight to the Ford’s provides additional challenges
 * New cards are shuffled into the encounter deck that cause meaningful decisions
 * Captain of Mordor enemy makes an appearance in Nightmare Mode

 

The Steward’s Fear

 * Underworld deck is populated with 2 burdens
 * New effect can bring a second Plot into play
 * Denethor presents some unexpected gifts upon completion

 

The Druadan Forest

 * Spend your resources wisely to earn boons
 * More powerful but harder-to-get boons await Nightmare players

 

 

Encounter at Amon Din

 * Cards added to the campaign pool depend on the number of dead villagers
 * Burdens include the game’s first permanent burden

 

The Massing at Osgiliath

 * Storyline ties this quest into the Shadows Over Gondor campaign
 * The Witch-king follows players into later quests if he’s not defeated
 * Revised effect on Stage 3 allows players to sacrifice Ranger boons
 * Nightmare setup card makes the quest harder for Nightmare players

 

Assault on Osgiliath

 * New Osgiliath location keeps solo players from breezing through the quest
 * What happens in the previous quest directly affects this one
 * Catapults besiege the locations players control

 

The Blood of Gondor

 * Powerful boons from a Boon deck can be earned by braving Orc ambushers
 * Adaptive difficulty makes earning boons easier in Easy Mode and harder in Nightmare Mode

 

The Morgul Vale

 * All-new quest card punishes players for leaving The Witch-king alive throughout the campaign
 * A new card type, “campaign bonus”, is introduced

 

 

And here is a spoiler image:

Note: The cards in this spoiler image that show the illustrator's name say "Unknown".  Do not take this to mean all of the cards in the expansion have "Unknown" as the artist.  I tried to to find out who all the art was by.

 

 

I hope you have as much playing this fan expansion as I had making it!

This is a great initiative. I've also thought about making boons and burdens for the cycles, but I didn't know the templates were available.

They are available in the strange eons plugin.

Looks interesting. The boons look really powerful, but conversely the burdens look horrible. I'd be interested in trying it out if it makes it to OCTGN!

Also, I'm afraid there's one slight error which I noticed: Poison-Darts, the response when you kill the enemy says you attach Poison-Arrows to a hero or Celador. I assume that should be Poison-Darts again.

It looks great. Especially Celador stuff. Will it be available in OCTGN?

I'd love to put it in OCTGN, but I don't know how. Perhaps someone with more technical expertise can help?

Poison-darts is fixed.  Thanks for pointing that out!

Bug: Close Combat burden's adventure says Forgotten Realms.

Is it just me, or that "Gondorian Battle Gear" looks extremely Rohan?

Sorry, I've never seen the movie.

I think it's mostly because it has horse heads all over it.

That was a horse? I thought it was a dragon. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Oops

Both fixed!

 

Coming soon: OCTGN materials!  Just for you PocketWraith and koriakin97!

Wow, after a *very* busy 3 days (although one of them was a school break) the OCTGN materials are now available [https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9xWxXaUn36WfmNXNXYwMEZNZXl5RGdPMUVSSHEzaXdaSHF0cDVrYTZ5bEI5NVFyVE11XzA&authuser=0] for Shadows Over Gondor! Feedback is welcome; I've never made an OCTGN set before and it might be a little rough around the edges.
