Those are my 3 favorite quests from the Dreamchaser cycle! I'll be placing my order tonight...

Just wish this means next news will be about next cycle.

Another nightmare. I'm expecting thing in the depths but the two others are not really in my heart.

@Gizlivadi [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/185970-gizlivadi/] I don't see why any news about nightmare could mean the next one is about next cycle. But I wish too (in fact I just wish more news and more cards, no matter which ones they are ^^)

It doesn't mean next one is next cycle, but getting the new POD and NM over with means we're closer to getting the next cycle announcement.

YES!!! Can't wait to get those... probably in 2019!!! (It takes forever since last year until FFG products become available in Canada :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png])

You can have it right now by ordering in FFG website you know ;). I'm no longer doing since stores get some in my country (so shipping is really cheaper ^^) but if you don't have any occasions talk about this to some people you know, may be wait for another NM announcement and order them :).
