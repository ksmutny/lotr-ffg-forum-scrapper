I do not have a deck that I use for every quest. I will make minor changes to my deck based on the strategy to be used for each quest. But with that said, as a solo player I always choose leadership/lore deck (usually more lore heavy). My favorite heroes I use every time I can is Aragorn, Denethor, and Glorfindel. Although when I need to start with a lower threat level I like to use Beravor, Denethor, and Gloin.

 

Even though I make minor changes to my deck for each quest there are some cards that I use every time. Gandalf obviously being one of them, and Sneak Attack to make assassin Gandalf (just made that up). I like to have as many Unique cards in my deck as I can, as long as they can contribute to the quest as needed; such as Gleowine, Steward of Gondor, Gildor Inglorion, Faramir,, and Celebrian's Stone. Some Non-Unique cards I will always use are Song of Kings, Rivendell Minstrel, Burning Brand, and Forest Snare.

 

I am currently only on the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle as well! I hope to catch Gollum in The Dead Marshes today. I would list my deck for this specific quest but I do not want to take up anymore space, it does include everything listed above though!

So I completed The Dead Marshes solo last night and got the worst score I have ever got for any quest. I scored 285!!! The first encounter card that was revealed during the setup on stage 1A was unfortunately the Impassable Bog. Its "when revealed" effect did not hurt me because there was no other locations in the staging area yet, but it has a large amount of quest points on it. So locations did build up over time and I could no longer pass escape tests and Gollum was gone. Next time I saw him he was a shadow card :mellow: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_mellow.png] . It took forever for him to come back up again. The entire game took 27 rounds. This was the deck that I used...

 

Hero (3)
Denethor (Core) x1
Glorfindel (Core) x1
Aragorn (Core) x1
 
 
Ally (27)
Rivendell Minstrel (THFG) x3
Daughter of the Nimrodel (Core) x3

I am going to make a few changes and do this quest again. 285 points is unacceptable haha.

@tacomen253 - 285?!? That's the kind of score you sweep under the rug while convincing yourself that you didn't really just play a game. It was all a dream.

 

And I wasn't really looking for one deck for everything. I was merely wondering what cards people would use at this point in the progression. I may do Conflict at the Carrock on Sunday. So, obviously, my decks will change a bit for that.
