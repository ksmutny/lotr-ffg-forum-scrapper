Hey guys, was just wondering if cards like Burning Brand and Armored Destrier work against enemies with the "Immune to player card effects." While these cards do kind of sound like they're targeting the shadow cards themselves, part of me was having doubts during our last game. Thanks!

Those are both legal against immune enemies.  As you say, they don't actually target the enemy, but the shadow card dealt to them.

By contrast, The Balrog in Journey in the Dark (though not the other two Balrog quests) specificaly says "The Balrog and shadow cards dealt to the Balrog are immune to player card effects." I believe that's the only case of shadow cards being actually immune and thus blocking discard effects like the Destrier, though there are other cases in which shadow effects cannot be cancelled.

Thanks for the help guys! I thought I had read that somewhere, but the confirmation is much appreciated!

The newly-revealed Battle of the Pellonor Fields scenario [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223799-battle-of-the-pellonor-fields/] has another scenario like that; its fifth quest card says "The Witch-King and shadow cards dealt to the Witch-King are immune to player card effects."

 

So the two most terrifying enemies in the book will be the two most terrifying enemies in the game as well. Excellent design, even though I'm cringing at the thought of facing the Witch-King. But then, I should be if the game was designed right!

I've just received answer from Caleb and it seems that the struggle with one of these most terrifying enemies can be eased a little, at least when we talk about immune shadow cards dealt to it:

 

The effect of Tides of Fate event card CAN be used during the Balrog's attack in Journey in the Dark scenario.
Here is my question and Caleb's answer:

Hello Caleb :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] just one quick question regarding Tides of Fate event card: would it be legal to play it during the Balrog's attack in the Journey in the Dark scenario, when a shadow effect of Many-pillared Hall increases Balrog's attack? One can say that ToF's effect does not target shadow card directly, but it targets defending character...
ToF effect: Response: When a shadow card increases an enemy's Attack by any amount, increase the defending character's Defense by 3 for that attack. Then, the players as a group may spend 2 Tactics resources to ready the defending character and give it +3 Attack for its next attack this phase.
The Balrog's text: (...) The Balrog and shadow cards dealt to The Balrog are immune to player card effects. (...)
And Many-pillared Hall's shadow effect: Shadow: Attacking enemy gets +1 Attack (+2 Attack instead if the defending player's threat is 35 or higher). Thanks in advance, cheers, Michal
A: Hi Michal, You can play Tides of Fate in the situation you describe because Tides of Fate doesn’t impact the Balrog or it’s shadow effect. Cheers, Caleb

There is one other situation in which shadow cards are immune to player card effects: during the night while playing Wastes of Eriador. I personally didn't like this ruling as the quest is a long and hard enough slog as is without all shadow cards being uncancelable every second turn.

Even then, the shadow cards are not immune. You could still discard them with the Destrier or similar effects, you just can't cancel the shadow effects with Hasty Stroke/Burning Brand/etc.

It's weird a torch is important during day and useless during night, isn't it?

True... need to go back and play this one now that I use Destrier so that I can discard shadow cards during night time and feel like a boss  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

The Torch isn't as important in the day either since all the wargs go back to staging and skip engagement so you have fewer shadow cards to deal with.

Whilst very true with that scenario I always try to destroy as many wargs as possible during the day so that each phase of night will not be quite as bad and I wont be facing as many uncancellable (but still discardable!!!) shadow effects. 

Also most of the wargs are stronger or nastier during the night so it pays off to get rid of them during the day if able via optional engagement, tactigorn etc.
