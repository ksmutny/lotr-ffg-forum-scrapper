There in fact was a discussion about this matter in some of the threads. There was even a link to where you get when you scan it.

It's pretty cool. That way when you see it in stores, you don't have to search for the contents online!

It's really cool. Obviously not something targeting me or my demographic because let's be honest I buy the new pack and tear into it within seconds of seeing it on the shelf every time lol, but definitely an awesome feature to have.

There's a (what looks to be) half-finished site containing most of the LCG cards released so far here [http://ffgapp.com/static/ffgcatalog/lcgmc/#/], and a few other unfinished bits and pieces here [http://ffgapp.com/static/].

This is news to me. My phone probably isn't capable of doing this however.

I'd love to see this feature on a random distribution game to make it less... random. But I doubt it will happen :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
