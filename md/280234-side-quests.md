Hello

Does the effects on the main quest still apply when you choose to do a side quest during the quest phase ?

For example, in The blood of Gondor, both of the quest stages says "At the beginning of the quest phase, each player draw a hidden card". Do I need to draw this hidden card if I choose to do a side quest ?

Thanks

Yes you have to.

But some effect that change the way you quest (battle, siege, defense) are only active when the selected quest is active. Example: I you choose to go to a double back during a Siege of Cair Andros stage 1 you quest in willpower.

Ok thanks

Oh, and another question about siege/battle quest.

In The blood of Gondor, the stage 2 has the battle keyword, and a location can add the siege keyword when it is the active location. Does the quest has both siege and battle (and you count the best between attack and defense for each character ?) or "siege"Â  replace "battle" while the location is active ?

The location in question (The Crossroads) explicitly notes that the quest card gains Siege and loses Battle. So, in this case, Siege replaces Battle while the location is in play.

Not on the french version of the card, it just says "The quest gains Siege" ? Bad translation, so.

Thank you
