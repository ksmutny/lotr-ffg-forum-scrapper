thanks ^^ only missing The Land of Shadow.  I noticed that there were 3 small sets of encounters related to the secondary missions introduced in Treachery of Rudhaur. Each of them has 3 cards. Now, 2 of these sets have only 2 cards on Hall of Beorn (the same x2) so there is one for each, and one of the 3 sets has no cards present on the site. So some of them are missing.

I have all the nightmare but land of shadow so I checked. Those writed at 2 of each are, in fact in 3 exemplary. The missing one is Life Drain. As a treachery it go on Thraudir as a shadow cards. An the shadow effect give +3 attack for this attack if the ennemy is Thraudir. If this attack destroy an ennemy it attach like a condition attachement and add 3 hit point to thaudir.

I tell the problem to Beorn so he may fix it.

I have the Land of Shadow, but I don't have a high quality scanner. I will be adding the text at some point in the near future. I need more animal helpers, a bear does not have enough paws...

The nightmare images for Ring-Maker, Treason of Saruman and Land of Shadow are coming. I scanned them a week ago, just haven't had time to cut them out yet in GIMP.
