I’ve had the collector’s edition for a while now but just noticed on the new card it says, “Attached hero gains +1 attack” in lieu of “Attached character gains +1 attack” as the core version shows. Is this a typo on the new card? Doesn’t look like there’s Errata for it that I can see...maybe I missed it.

You can see both versions on ringsdb.com.

Looks like a typo to me but with all the other cards like Burning Brand and Battle Master getting changed who knows. If someone who recenlty bought khazad-dum can check there's out and see if it still says "character" on both lines.

It got to be a typo, like @stimpaksam [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/309009-stimpaksam/] said... Both cards say to attach to a dwar character.

Doesn't make any sense attach to a ally and don't get any bonus.

 

 

Oh and now the damage is for the defending character instead of the enemy as it was in the original one...
