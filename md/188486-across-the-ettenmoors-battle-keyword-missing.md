# [Across the Ettenmoors - Battle keyword missing?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188486-across-the-ettenmoors-battle-keyword-missing/)

I had a chance to play Across the Ettenmoors last night and noticed that the rules insert has the rules text for the Battle keyword. When the rules insert contains information about a particular mechanic then that mechanic will be utilized in the quest. Yet I've looked at the 3 Quest cards and 3 Side Quest cards for the scenario and do not see the Battle keyword on any of them.

 

So I'm wondering - should one of the quest stages or a side quest have the Battle keyword on it? Or am I overlooking something?

 

On a side note, hadn't considered the possibility of Battle/Siege on a Encounter Side Quest. That would be rather annoying.

They included Battle in the rules because of the Delay the Enemy player side quest.

Yup, knew I'd missed something. Thanks.
