I played two games today, both of them were Journey down the Anduin, and they were like complete opposites.  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]  

 

The first time I ran into two Banks of the Anduin pretty early on. So with the Troll and the rotating Banks I knew how much to quest each round, and I could slowly build my team. In the end I only encountered one Hill Troll, one Dol Guldur Orcs and some treachery's that most of the time didn't have any big impact.

 

So, after such an easy win I immediately played again. A game I shall remember.. 

Within only a couple of rounds I had one Hill Troll, two Dol Guldur Beastmasters and a Goblin Sniper, waiting for me in the staging area. I felt hopeless, considered to just surrender and start a new game, but I didn't. 

After luring these foul beasts out one at a time, with some help from Gandalf, I managed to kill them all.  :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

In the second stage I even encountered another another Hill Troll, but this one was no match for my marching army and within three rounds after completing the first stage I won the game.

 

And it felt awesome, so I wanted to share this experience!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Awesome!

Excellent wins well done and so glad you enjoyed :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Great stuff!

Myself I struggled at Anduin for quite some time, though I do love its variety of thematic stages to the quest.

Yay!

Yes, before today I managed to win this scenario only once, so today was a good day.

Think I'll start with the quests from the expansions now. 

 

And I love how every card in this game feels so thematic and true to character.

It even encourages me to build thematic decks, which I love that it is even viable to try.

I still feel accomplished whenever I beat JDTA, even in these days. Such a great quest! Glad to see you are enjoying the game.

Congratulations, your second game sounds like it was a hard fought victory! As a new player myself Journey Along the Anduin is the quest I play most frequently, and I always get lulled into a false sense of my own invincibility whenever I have an easy win. Two hill trolls usually disillusion me of this notion on my next game!

What kind of deck did you go for and what starting threat?

Also was it full encounter cards plus shadow cards?

Either way still awesome wins but would be interested to know :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

My heroes are Elrond, Bilbo and Glorfindel, with starting threat of 27 I believe. 

Important other cards are Vilya, Gandalf, Gildor, Haldir, Warden of Healing, Galadhrim's Greeting and Elrond's Counsel.

 

- Elrond, Vilya & Gildor for playing expensive cards like Gandalf and Haldir.

- Warden of Healing & Elrond for 2x2 healing every turn.

- Galadhrim's Greeting & Elrond's Counsel for threat reduction.

Congrats on your wins, especially the second one. The tougher victories are the most rewarding! Journey down the Anduin is still no slouch of a quest even to this day with the large pool of player cards.

Holy cow!  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

After successfully clue-hunting for Gollum yesterday, I tried the Conflict at the Carrock today.

 

So, the first stage wasn't really a problem. Slowly building up my team and questing through some locations. 

Then came the second stage.

Four Trolls?! Okay, they're only in the staging area and my threat is 28, so I have time to think this through.

Encounters an Hill Troll. Hmm, okay.. I'll take this one down and then I'll take on the other Trolls!

Encounters another Hill Troll.. Wow.. So 2 Hill Trolls next turn, better call Gandalf and set up some defense.

Next turn. Okay, threat to 30. Time to take these Trolls down!

Encounters River Langflood.. +1 threat for every Troll.. Threat to 40..

All 6 Trolls engage at once. 

Dead.
