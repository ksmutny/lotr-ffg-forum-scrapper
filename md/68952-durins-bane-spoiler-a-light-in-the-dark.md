# [Durin&#039;s Bane (Spoiler) + A Light in the Dark ](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68952-durins-bane-spoiler-a-light-in-the-dark/)

A Light in the Dark:  "Action: Choose an enemy engaged with a player. Return that enemy to the staging area."

Durin's Bane: "Durin's Bane cannot leave the staging area, is considered to be engaged with each player whose threat is 1 or greater, and attacks each of those players in turn during the combat phase (deal and discard a new shadow card each attack).

1) Can I legally target Durin's Bane since Durin's Bane is both engaged with a player and still in the staging area at the same time?

2) If yes and if played after engagement checks are made, will this cancel Durin's Bane's attack on the player who played the card? or all players? Or will his attack go off regardless?

Thanks

There's nothing preventing you from playing ALitD, but it won't have any effect.

DB is certainly engaged with you, so it meets the criteria for ALitD. But you'd just return DB to the staging area…where it already is. SInce DB is always passively engaged with any player whose threat is 1 or higher, it will stay engaged (and make attacks) even if you "return it" to the staging area.

Thanks!

I take it Feint would work just fine on Durin's Bane as well then? And would it counter the attack made by Durin's Bane on all players it is making an attack against?

As worded, Feint would cancel all attacks made by DB (since it prevents the targeted enemy from attacking for the entire phase).

It's possible FFG may clarify this interaction to specify that Feint only stops attacks against a single player (or doesn't work at all in multiplayer games, since DB is technically engaged with more than *a* player), but the cards as printed allow you to negate all attacks for a single combat phase. 

Currently, Hama + Feint can make DB really easy to handle. That's why I wouldn't be surprised to see official errata/clarification in the near future.

Yea I was doubting that interaction based on how easy that encounter would be with Hama + Feint

Thanks again for the quick responses.
