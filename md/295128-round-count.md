When we start the game we must set the round counter to 1...right? we do not start from 0 and set the round to 1 during refresh phase, right?

It depends if you count the number of completed rounds, or if it is the current round number.

I prefer the second option, so I would start the counter to 1

According to the rules, a round is counted when it is completed. So if you complete a scenario during the ninth round, you would say for score purposes that the game took eight rounds.

This is actually correct.

So i do not count the last round if i win the game during it?

## 7 [Wandalf the Gizzard on May 10, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295128-round-count/?do=findComment&comment=3699381)

Right. The round you win during does not count as a full round.
