Hello,

I broke open my Flame of the West Saga box and the quest "The Battle of Pelanor Fields" cards say there is 45 cards but I only count 44.  Also the cards I have are 2/45 - 45/45 and I cant find card number 1/45.  I've looked on Cardgamedb and counted the card numbers and I hope I'm right that this is an editing error and I have all the cards.  Does anyone have a card labeled 1/45?  If so what is it?

 

Thanks
