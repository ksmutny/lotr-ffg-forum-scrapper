did I just miss it or is it possible to but a snare on a balrog?

Which Balrog do you mean? The Shadow and Flame one? "cannot play attachments!"

Road Darkens: "Immume to player card effects"

So 1 time no, 1 time yes but no effect.

The Nameless Fear can't be engaged so no and also immume to player cards.

the second one, "immune to player card effects," also can't even have an attachment.  Playing an attachment onto something is considered a form of "targeting," and immune cards cannot be targeted.

Yeah, I forgot that. Same as with Beorn.
