I had to post this…..


 


I played a two player game RtR with a friend. We did quite well. Got one early Sleeping Sentry but it did no damage and by traveling to Ruined Road to we could even ready a hero to block the single enemy we had in the staging area……..


 


The game went quite well from there on. Had another SS but canceled it. In mid game, while in stage 2 we got Orc Ambush.


12 Orcs, but thanks to Lure of Moria and then an Orcslayer in the next round we managed to stay alive.


At one time we still had 6 enemies engaged and we knew we could only get rid of two shadows.


 


Black Uruks were blocked by a Gondorian Spearman and thus killed.


One Orc was blocked by Bifur with Burning Brand….. after revealing the shadow cards we felt sooooo lucky……both were Sleeping Sentry.


 


So after that we managed to get in the game again…….and then in the middle of stage 3, we got Orc Ambush again ( first encounter card )……….thankfully my second player could cancel the when reveaed effect. It surged into something normal and then………………………………………………

Wow, how many copies of Orc Ambush are in the deck? I always felt like it was only one, as I only got it rarely. I like the picture of your fellowship though, as sneak around the ambush, patting themselves on their shoulder when it's done, while the next Orc patrol is already aiming their arrows at them…

 FFG decided that two Sleeping Sentries are much to easy, so they decided on putting two Orc Ambush in the deck…….and got those two surge. Because the  best thing after getting 12 Orcs in the staging area, is getting a 13th orc.
