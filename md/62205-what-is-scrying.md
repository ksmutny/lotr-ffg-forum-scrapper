 Someone mentioned it earlier but I don't recall seeing anything about it in the core rules. I assume it is an AP Mechanic. Can someone explain?

 No, it's a Magic: the Gathering mechanic.  In that game "Scry X" means to look at the top X cards of your deck, put some on the bottom and the rest on the top.

People use it in LoTR to simply mean looking at the top few cards of a deck (yours or the encounter deck, usually).
