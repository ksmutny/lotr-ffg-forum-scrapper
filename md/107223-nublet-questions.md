Hi all.

 

Finally got to play two games of this last evening and LOVED it.played with a friend and we both used mono (?) decks. Played passage through Mirkwood. However I've got a few questions I'm unsure about . . . 

 

1. Is there a limit to hand size for players?

 

2. Is there a limit to how many cards can be in the staging area at any one time?

 

3. Do I assume monsters engaged with players DON'T count to the threat level when questing?

 

4. If you use the Gandalf card and deal 4 damage to a creature, does it take its armour value off or is that 4 hit points of damage?

 

5. Eomers ability is to add a resource to any hero on the quest with him. Can that include him?

 

Many thanks in advance.

 

Regards

Can you also play cards from your hand (Attachments) onto other players heroes?

 

Thanks!
