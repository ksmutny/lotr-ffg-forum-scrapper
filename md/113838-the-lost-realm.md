Impressed with the new card dynamics. Ranger of the North looks very interesting. A bit like the rangers in Massing in Osgiliath. Great for small encounter decks like Into Ithilien.

Wow!  They are really going outside the box with these cards.  Shuffling player cards into the encounter deck?  Very exciting!

Having trouble wrapping my head around Ranger Summons, but I need to read the article.  I like what I'm seeing with Dunedain though.  Sarn Ford Sentry is cute, even with the scar.  Dunedain Hunter.... wow.

 

Read the article.  Ranger Summons... wow again.  I've been hoping to field a true Dunedain deck someday and now I can't wait for this cycle.  (Of course I'll have to, predicting April '15.)

These card are interesting to say the least. Seems like the developers are challenging the traditional deck building paradigms again!

edit: Looks like the cards are designed against turtling again, which is good. Seems like strong aggro cards are par for the course in the new expansion. Fascinating! The hunted are now the hunters.

Hey they used my quote on the expert trackers card.  I guess they do read the forums!  

 

Very excited about this,  the rangers of the north are my favorite archtype.  Looks really interesting what they are do with them.

 

I wonder if there will be other ways besides the leadership event to get the RotN card in the encounter deck.

## 7 [FetaCheese on August 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113838-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1209531)

Sidequests sound great. A new type of encounter cards basically that add a deeper level to the otherwise mundane questing part of the game. Bonus victory points for our score-counting fellow players, additional strategy and complexity without feeling forced (like imho, battle and siege quests).

Player cards that don't take up deck space are similarly intriguing. The 50 card deck has been fairly restrictive in the past, but once again, thanks, to smart design by the FFG folks, we have a wholly new way of approaching deck building. And allies that are added to the encounter deck sound fun as hell.

Seems like we got our selves another winner here.

Even? A well-placed scar makes a beautiful face even more attractive, adds some spice, if you will.

 

P.S.: I like the new side-quest mechanic. Confused by victory points icon though. I hope they will leave it in old fashion, just a bold text.

If you would read the article, you'll find that this out-of-deck card can be played only by using an in-deck card, so if you want to use those rangers, you'll need to devote deck space to the events that call those rangers, meaning nothing new from this viewpoint. What I'm afraid of is that now we get two cards which are essentially one, and this might lead to an effective player card count reduction in the expansion and adventure packs.

The side quests seem neat - explore them if you want but if you ignore them then you have to eat there threat. Really cool adn thematic (kind of like an RPG game where you can chose to do side quests or not)

 

The ability to add player cards to the encounter deck is neat.

 

You have to give credit - they are thinking outside the box here

Rally excited about this expansion. It seems that we will have a quest located in Chetwood after all which is a good thing. Looking forward to making ranger decks again and this time built around Dunedain trait. 

 

Good.

## 13 [chrsjxn on August 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113838-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1209657)

There's a Signal keyword on Ranger Summons! I'm hoping this means we'll get some Signal synergy in the box.

 

But also the fact that encounter decks are getting smaller should make the summons more reliable.

## 14 [Jekzer on August 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113838-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1209739)

And to top all of your comments, have you seen the "Mission card" on the first photo, with the bunch of other cards?

 

Seems like they are adding kind of a Campaign Mode right from the box. That's what they're saying on the Product page. Normally when they say that is because you have the chance to play the quests in one go, but now they seem to link them together, just like in Saga Expansions.

There is no reason for concern here since they will most likely be adding additional out-of-deck cards in the future. So maybe one could have e.g. 6 in-deck summoning cards but 12 out of deck. With recycling effects as they are, I still think that deck building will be a richer experience. Of course, we should wait for more info before coming to conclusions, but I am optimistic.

I feel pretty confident the 2nd hero in the box will be leadership. With Aragorn tactics in the spotlight there will be no Dunedain leadership hero to play, unless we use core set Aragorn, but i bet the developers will give us the opportunity to play the Dunedain event to use Ranger of the north without relying on the older version of Aragorn, so we can play the new tactics version.

My hope is that the 2nd hero will have a threat of 7 or lower. So, if Idrean and Aragorn are paired we would be at 30 threat. Aragorn and Beravor would be 29 threat, and if new 7 threat hero were paired with Beravor and Idrean we would be at 28 threat. These all seem pretty reasonable to me. Or if they have a high threat there would be some discount based on controlling all Dunedain or Ranger heroes, or something like that.

If we get another threat 10+ hero a 3 hero dunedain deck may suffer.

## 19 [Bullroarer Took on August 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113838-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1210081)

Ranger of the North has no shadow effect, so it's possible to wiff with him.  Or add Shadow of the Past, but that seems like a lot of work.  He has decent stats though so it might be worth it.

Notice how this summoning event specifically refers to the card title. Meaning it can't summon anything else. So it's one event for one out of play card. As for recycling, if you read the card text, this summoning event will not be placed into the discard pile - it is removed from the game, means no recycling allowed. 

 

What I find interesting about this encounter deck ranger, is that it can be wasted through shadow (sparing you an unshadowed attack though) AND if he is destroyed, then he goes into the encounter discard pile and if encounter deck is reshuffled - you can hope to see him again (and be wasted by shadow again :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).

## 21 [Johnny Awesome on August 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113838-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1210221)

The Ranger of the North will be good in 4-player games where you cycle the encounter deck, but pretty useless for solo IMO.

 

Rule clarification: When it says to shuffle the encounter deck, do you add the discard pile in or can you wait until the encounter deck is almost depleted before putting the Ranger in so you're likely to get him from a tiny remaining encounter deck?

## 22 [Gizlivadi on August 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113838-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1210318)

Wow, just... wow. 

 

These mechanics are really innovative and impressive. I especially like the encounter keyword on the Ranger of the North. I wonder if we'll see more "encounter" player cards we can shuffle from our set aside deck into the encounter deck? More allies, maybe even events and attachments you find in your way. It seems that for now we only have the Ranger of the North for this, since the Ranger Summons specifically mention this ally.

 

Also, I'm loving the idea of side quests. It's kinda like what I had been expecting for a while. I'd love if some of these side quests actually were alternate win-conditions, with "if the players defeat this stage, they win the game." Obviously thos would have to be hard to beat, but they kinda represent another turn or decision the party makes, which would be interesting, like those choose your own adventure books. Also, I hope side quests become a normal thing after the next cycle. I would definately like to see them often.

Have you seen an example of this side quest? It's a nasty condition that floats around and makes your life more miserable until you put enough progress onto it. Nothing rpg like in this.

Maybe not. Dunedain thrives on engaging enemies, so maybe they purposefully want Dunedain to have higher threat.

I admit I must agree with this. If all side quests are going to be basically locations with nasty effects, I will be dissapointed. I think though that this is only a basic example of what side quests are, and maybe we'll get more diverse and interesting side quests, like the ones I was talking about.

Sure that occurred to me, and may certainly be the case since it would fit the theme they are building around the trait, although i feel it will just force me to choose non-thematic solutions for the deck i.e. spirit glorfindel, even hobbits would feel unthematic with the story they are building around the expansion. The rangers are keeping them safe not bringing hobbits along with them on their adventures at this point. So, i doubt I'll see a 7 threat hero, and the best I can hope for is under 10. I'd be satisfied with that.

Situations like this, IMO, must be interpreted just like effect inconsistencies when playing a game. If it's worse for the players, that's the correct answer. So if the news article says it'll be released early in 2015, that will probably be the case.

I really like Tactics Aragorn.  Both of his abilities feel very thematic.  I'm having visions of an Aragorn, Hama, and Eomer deck that could handle all of the enemies for a 3 or 4 player game.  Hama would let you recycle feints and thickets of spears while Aragorn engages any enemies that slip onto other players and makes all enemies easier to kill with his passive.  Rohan Warhorses, daggers, spears and Eomer with Firefoot should give enough attack power to finish off any enemies you are engaged with.  Aragorn could also make straight shot effective against 1 defense enemies.

> Opinions on Tactics Aragorn?

 

Love the -1 Defense bit. As for his other ability, I hate that it requires you to make a kill first, so generally you'll have to wait until the other player has already defended an attack first (Quick Strike is a valuable alternative). Of course, you can also use it on enemies in the staging area, which means you can have a turn to attack it without having to defend it that round. I just wonder how often that scenario will play out with a high-threat Dunedain and/or Tactics deck. There are also a few other ways to pull enemies to you, (e.g. Westfold Outrider), so I don't feel like we need his ability, though a consistent ability available on a hero is nice and he can pull multiple enemies per round assuming he can kill multiple enemies per round.

 

An interesting combo can come from cards like Noiseless Movement, Advance Warning, and/or A Light in the Dark that can keep enemies in the staging area, so we can avoid having to defend, but then (assuming we engaged at least one enemy or we had one engaged from the previous turn), we can kill an enemy, pull a new one down, kill it, pull another down, etc. Some cool combinations related to Merry, Brand Son of Bain, Rohan Warhorse, and/or other readying effects could keep the killing cycle going. We could also have Haldir and/or Dunhere in another deck to attack them before Aragorn pulls them down.

 

Gotta have at least two decks to really make him powerful and even then I wonder how often we can make Aragorn's ability really useful. Gonna have to playtest him to find out I guess.

I assume you are talking about his -1 Def ability. I believe that it technically targets all enemies engaged with you, though you're right that the wording makes it difficult to determine.

This dude seems really good in the right deck even without any of the other dunedain/engaging support to come...

So long as you have plenty of defense and are not currently engaged to too many enemies you can play him for free, take on a relatively weak enemy (most of the time), easily defend against it and ignore its when revealed effects AND threat and then dispatch it with Legolas to gain progress.

Also the fact is your more than likely going to have the enemy affected by this card come out anyway within the next few turns if it does not come out as a shadow card so this card merely puts it straight into play engaged with you so you can KILL IT FASTER =D

Would be cool to drop a few of those in one round and then play the sweet lady that draws you a card for each engaged enemy.

Just played Nightmare Passage through Mirkwood and ran x3 copies of Dunedain Hunter in my deck. Drew one in my opening hand and a second later on. I used the first and chose King Spider with his effect:

ffg_king-spider-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_king-spider-core.jpg]

Avoiding his nasty when revealed and simply having a fairly weak enemy engaged.

The second Dunedain Hunter I played ended in me choosing this enemy:
ffg_forest-flies-passage-through-mirkwoo [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_forest-flies-passage-through-mirkwood-nightmare.jpg]

Again I avoided a nasty effect as all my characters were ready as it was the planning phase. Not to mention how weak this enemy is with only 1 attack and 3 hitpoints which even the Dunedain Hunter himself can kill in one hit.

 

Needless to say they were amazing in this particular game with next to no setback. I also had Treebeard out and between Haldir with a rivendell blade, dagger and dunedain mark, legolas, treebeard and the two hunters I was easily able to slay all enemies that came out inclusive of Ungoliants Spawn! Ungoliants Spawn reduced only Elrond and Glorindels willpower by 2 and they both survived on 1 willpower escaping her onslaught! Got very lucky that the round she was revealed I could only commit those two heroes due to an Ungoliants Brood causing all of the tactics/leadership team to be exhausted minus Elrohir who escaped due to a crazily helpful unexpected courage.

 

So far for this particular quest and my deck 5/5 for this ally! I think he will vary massively on the quest however

Yeah, I think one of the clarifications of "immune to player card effects" was that it stops any effect that directly interacts with the stats of such a card or changes its game state, With this in mind, I think Tactics Aragorn's effect is a no go for "immune" enemies.

That would certainly be most effective, though, in quests like Massing at Osgiliath you could get some pretty good draw in 2 or 3 player.

Yes!! Everything about this box looks amazing to me! The Dunedain Hunter seems super powerful!! but the Ranger of the North you can put into the encounter deck seems a bit too limited and takes some setup: getting the event and then waiting for him to come up hopefully not as a shadow.. but it's still a cool idea. Sarn Ford Sentry looks epic also, another cool chic and she works well with traps.. Forest Snare anyone  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

We can also now have an epic mono-Tactics for the Three Hunters!!! I don't care about the "high" threat, they'll be fun and amazing to play!

 

And yes side quests and hopefully campaign-like features will make these quests all super fun!!

I've been trying to remember what they had in angmar in LOTRO. It's been a long while since I went through that area, but the big ending was in the big fortress of Carn Dum. And the mountains were full of drakes and baby drakes, and there was lots of spectral stuff in the misty swamps and black mountains.

Some of the towns were quite atmospheric too, they were like big tented cities made out of animal hides, full of hunters

I'd love to see drakes, but they will probably save that for a cycle set in Northern Rhovanion.

It's not against the rules. Or even the law.

You don't even need to print anything to play a proxy of these cards. You can just say, "Keeping Count, today you are Dunedain Hunter. Theoden, you be Aragorn."

Yeah I just print off copies that are the exact size of the cards and put it over the top of a real card in a sleeve.

Works suprisingly well so long as you print in colour (duh!) and cut it out nicely.

Don't see any reason it would be against the law or rules and it's not like I'm not going to buy the cards when they come out. Its just so I can use some future player cards (that have been spoiled anyway) early and test them out.

I do the same thing with OCTGN. I created a "set" called "Future Set" and I throw any new cards in there and add the images. I wish I had more time to test these cards out though.

A great attachment for this deluxe or its following cycle Angmar Awakened could be:

 

Dunedain Prowess

1 cost

Tactics Sphere

 

Attach to a Dunedain Character

Attached Character gets +1 attack. Restricted.

If you are engaged with 3 or more enemies attached character can make an additional attack during the combat phase.

Couldn't come up with a better name :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

When you add a card from your deck to the encounter deck how do you deal with the seeing the back of the card? Or does that card have the eye?

Obviously it does, otherwise they wouldn't need to make an event that summons that card.

I do the same... I'm too likely to forget what they are meant to be and just ignore the cards if I don't.

I'm chompin' at the bit for more news and spoilers as well. Dunedain, Rangers of the North and the glory and ruin of Arnor have always been the things I loved best about the books. If Halbarad (crosses fingers) is the second hero I wonder what sphere he'll be? Will we we see Arwen's banner? I'm hoping there'll be more Dunedain/Rangers than already spoiled as I'd love to run pure Grey Company decks. I'm having loads of fun running a Dunedain/Gondor Ranger trap deck right now. Argh, the wait is killin' me.

lost-realm-fan2.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-lost-realm/lost-realm-fan2.png]

 

The Cornered Orc. I like how both spoiled enemies yet are not hulking behemothes with 9/18/27/36 stats as it was popular recently, but some medicore stat'n'nasty effect guys.

Totally agree. Clever enemies are more fun than hulking brutes who just tear you apart. They're tedious (at least, to my mind). I like the Neeker Breekers in Nin, which are weedy, but have a nasty effect. Great design!

Yea, and it opens up some deck design space because you don't need as many weapons or as much armor to take them on. This opens up more attachment slots. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also means you can validly use a lot of interesting cards that cannot target a lot of the big baddies these days. I was relieved to see that the Swamp creature in the Nin quest can be affected by cards (except attachments)! Thank goodness!! It's very annoying having to use stat boosters all the time, since they always fire, rather than using interesting cards that cannot interact. 

 

This is, I realise, a personal gripe. Grumble over.
