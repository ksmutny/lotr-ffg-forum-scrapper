I check those cards and quest is doesn't look to hard for me… but in compaign mode is ok. But there is no boons and burden cards? Anyway looks ok, good additional to saga mode. So now when we will get a second box we can play 7 quest in 1 go… very cool!

Old Forest remember me the Fangorn quest (3rd of VoI). The Fangorn quest is the most boring for me. I hope Old Forest be different of it.

Art on that red horn gate pak is really stellar. Looking forward to that one, was

One of my faves back in the day even tho I haven't played it recently

So excited! I can't wait for the nightmare version of Watcher in the Water! That is one of my all-time favorite scenarios.

It is a little confused, it could be in another post with a correct title.

I stopped caring about that a while ago. People are discussing both new expansions in the "Treason of Saruman" thread, instead of making a "Gen Con general" thread. Either they are pretty bad at naming threads or keeping on topic, or they just don't care.

Or both.

Losing my mind over all these gen con spoilers......

first the next saga pack Treason of Isengard which looks goddamn awesome, also think its really cool we aren't randomly lumped with Frodo for parts of the story he wasn't around, Aragorn as the fellowship hero but without the ring is just awesome.

Then the next deluxe! Which just looks amazing as well, art especially. That tactics Aragorn looks great for tactics and I'm also tempted to proxy him and try him out now!!!! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

We also got full Old Forest Spoilers and then art spoilers for dwarrowdelf nightmare packs which may be one of the most exciting revelations for me to be honest. The Dwarrowdelf quests are just so goddamn good and nightmare versions will be so fun to play.

Question for The Old Forest. Because it doesn't state that stage 2 quest cards are shuffled back into any sort of quest deck or anything like Flight from Moria, does this mean after putting progress on the fourth stage 2 card (if you havent advanced to stage 3 by then) you simply remain there if you cant advance to stage 3 until you can advance?

I couldn't get to any of the events lately, but does anyone know if we could order the Old Forest / Fog of the Barrow Downs allready?

All I see are Nightmares, Massing, Lake-Town and Stone of Erech

## 18 [Gizlivadi on October 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113425-the-old-forest-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1304000)

That means it's not yet available. I think they announce each time a new POD scenario is available for order.
