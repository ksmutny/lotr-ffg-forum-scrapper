Hello. I have simple question about setup in 1A stage of Across the Ettenmoors. When I randomly reveal 1 safe location and 1 safe quest and add them to the staging area with safe location guarded by the side quest, should I guard this safe location with one more encounter card? I ask because there is word "reveal" in the setup, and keyword "guarded" force to draw an encounter card to guard this card with "guarded" keyword. Simply asking - is the safe location guarded by one card (side quest) or two cards (side quest and encounter card)?

Thanks for your help.

Yeah, I just re-read the setup and I can see where that's a touch confusing. However, the next line says you're "adding" them to the staging area, so you're all good. You end up with the safe location guarded by the side quest. To my knowledge, guarded cards can't be guarded by more than one card. Hope that helps.
