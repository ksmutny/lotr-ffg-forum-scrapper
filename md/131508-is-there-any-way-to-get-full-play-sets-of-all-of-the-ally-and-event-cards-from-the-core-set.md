I just bought this game, and I noticed that some of the event, attachment, and ally cards from the Core Set do not come in the full set of three cards each.  Is there a way to get a full play set of each of the cards without buying more than one Core Set?  Thanks for any help you may be able to provide!

The only way to get 3 copies of all the cards is to buy 3 core sets.  But you really don't need to.  I've been playing for years and I have all the expansions, but still only 1 core set.

Thanks.  I am just weird with collecting stuff like this where I like to have the max of everything whether I end up needing to use it or not.

Ebay has some core set playsets I believe, or at least copies of the 2-of cards.

You're not really supposed to need it. I've played for years with just one. There are stashes of the 2-of cards (like Sneak Attack) on sites like eBay, but the only reason I've considered buying a second core set is to get two Unexpected Courage and it doesn't feel worth it.
