There's been lots of discussion on what are the best cards to use, but are there any that you consider a waste of your time and resources?

I mainly run Lore and find that there's probably an overdose of Healing cards.  Daughter Of Nimrodel and Self Preservation are all I use (as they are permenant), but the other Healing cards aren't really needed.  Glorfindal's ability can be used in an emergency, or to top up Allies.  I also have a hard time justifying spending valuable resource points to draw cards.  Would much rather use Berevor of Gleowine for that.

I'm aware of the fact that some people may have great combos with cards I regard as "waste of space" - please let me know them ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I never use:

Ever Vigilant

Comon cause

Grim resolve (too expensive)

Thicket of Spears

Will of the West

A light in the dark

Gandalf's search

Beorn's hospitality (too expensive)

Dark knowledge

 

And quite seldom:

Brok Ironfist (too expensive)

Lorien guide

While there are more useful and less useful cards, some of it depends on players' styles. For example, unlike you, my main attraction to lore is for their card draw. I find that if I build up a resource pool(usually need leadership for this) card draw is great because it gives you many options and a way to pay for them. Conversely, many people swear by Protector of Lorien. I personally don't care too much for it, because I'm not a big fan of constantly discarding cards. They are in the deck for a reason and thus are far more useful to me played than discarded. Aside from that, I think the poster above named quite a few of the less useful ones. Some are too expensive, some are too situational, some are just not very good. Among others, stuff  like Power in the Earth(traveling is a far better solution) and Thicket of Spears(great effect, but only playable by a mono tactics deck) is pretty useless, right now.

Ever vigilant is one of the most useful cards.You can quest with Gandalf and then  you can use him to defend or attack a monster.Ever vilgilant is a great card.

Grim resolve with  Steward of Gondor is not expensive and this card can save your life.

Will of the west is the best card for nightmare mode.

Funny you mention it, few moments ago I have been thinking about it.

Tactics: Rain of Arrows, Stand Together, Thicket of Spears (never do solo Tactics)

Leadership: Brok Ironfist (never plan on losing heroes), Common Cause, Guard of the Citadel (joke), Longbeard Orc Slayer, Silverlode Archer

Spirit: A Light in the Dark, Fortune or Fate (never plan on losing heroes), Lorien Guide (used to use it), Power in the Earth (rather explore), Strength of Will (used to use it), Wandering Took, Will of the West

Lore: Gandalf's Search, Gleowine (what a picture, blah), Miner from the Iron Hills (although I see he can be very useful, especially when objectives accumulate)

I second the usefulness of Ever Vigilant, one of my favourites. And Grim Resolve can really decide the game, at that time you should have easilly accumulated/saved enough resources for it. The same could go for Beorn's Hospitality although I believe Grim Resolve can have a more striking effect.

I seem to again agree with you; however, Protector of Lorien is one of the cards that I feel I would never exclude from my deck. It only costs 1 and you need not to use it frequently but only when it really matters. And then for either questing or combat - or both in likely cases. Put it on Aragorn for instance. And at the end of the game, of the Dol Guldur scenario, you just get rid of all the cards just to make it final. I love the card.

I would say Lore wins my never used title. They have Lorien's Wealth and Gandalf's Search, neither of which have I used other than discard fodder for a friendly Eowyn.

While somewhat expensive, Lorien's Wealth is great to increase your options with a bigger draw. And if you are looking to discard, a bigger hand is always better. There may be cheaper options, Valiant Sacrifice, Gleowine, etc, but I've found it a very effective card in my decks.

I think Lorien's Wealth in reasonably good. It lets you build a deck using cheaper cards which is useful in multi-sphere decks.

I agree with you about Gandalf's Search though. It is too expensive to be of much use. Maybe if it let you look at 3 cards per cost then it might see play in my decks.

## 12 [TheLightdarker on May 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46854-what-cards-do-you-never-use/?do=findComment&comment=469420)

Keeping in mind that I play mostly two-player games, and have the least experience with Tactics, the following are some of the cards that I would very rarely or even never consider using, either due to excessive cost or lack of utility:

Rain of Arrows (rarely is any player ever "swarmed" with enemies, and you would have to have a Ranged character in play and exhaust it to play this.  Since that character is typically Legolas, I would rather have him attacking directly, 3 is huge and so is 2 progress tokens... I can't rely on Silverlode/Horseback Archer or something being in play)

Brok Ironfist (He has pretty good stats for an Ally, but I just can't justify paying 6 for him.  He's an okay attacker and good quester, and while he can defend fairly well with 4 HP and 1 defense, if I'm playing Leadership I'll probably have Gloin out doing all the defending so that he can generate resources and catch heals.  That leaves Brok to do a kinda "meh" job where other Allies could do the same for cheaper.  As for his ability, I don't want to count on having a Hero leave play, especially so specific as to be a Dwarf hero, and it doesn't happen often enough that I would always want this card in my hand)

Lore of Imladris (For one less resource than a Daughter of Nimrodel or a Self Preservation, you get a one-time heal instead of one that is useable every round, potentially more than once.  Heal all damage is much better than 2, but rarely do I find myself ever needing to heal more than 2.  With rare exceptions, such as Aragorn wearing 2x Citadel Plate, I just can't justify putting this in as an event when other cards are much more resource efficient)

Beorn's Hospitality (5 resources makes this very difficult to afford, see above.  Also worth noting, rarely do I have damage distributed among several Heroes, and when I do, I'd rather save my resources and slowly, efficiently heal them all)

Radagast's Cunning (Since I normally play two-player games that involve Eowyn loaded up with Celebrian's Stone and The Favor of the Lady(s), beating or breaking even with the Threat in the Staging Area is rarely difficult.  Considering most enemies contribute 2-3 Threat, I just can't see this as a MUST HAVE card)

Secret Paths (Same deal as above, although at least it's much more likely that I'll have Locations piling up in the Staging Area than enemies, and there are some Locations that have far more Threat than the average creature.  For example, the encounter deck during Journey Down the Anduin having several copies of The Brown Lands, as opposed to the third scenario having the only Threat 5 enemy, the Nazgul of Dol Guldur, which is a single.  Northern Tracker makes this card far less useful, too)

Gandalf's Search (Two options here: 1) spend hardly anything to play this card and get barely any use, i.e., pay 2 to look at the top two cards of your deck, keep one, and "arrange" the other one to your liking, or 2) blow a ton of resources to get a card you probably need very soon, and you can plan what you draw far in advance.  The problem with #1 is that you get hardly any use from it, and the problem with #2 is that you use up all of your resources just to get a card that you then won't be able to afford to play for a while!  Maybe good in a mono-sphere or very Lore heavy deck, but I can't see this card as much more than a huge resource investment.  Too much, for me.)

Lorien Guide (I feel bad for including this card, as I really want to like it, it's just that Northern Tracker is worlds better in almost every way.  To make use of Lorien Guide's ability, you have to travel to locations, and in many cases doing that has detrimental effects that come along with it.  Also, if there's no active location, you don't get to use it's ability, making it pretty expensive 1 Willpower Ally; plus, if you're playing Spirit, chances are that you'll have Northern Trackers in your deck, and if you get them into play, you won't want an active location.  Awful attacker, even worse defender.)

Power in the Earth (I can see why this card exists, to save people from having to "waste" progress tokens on a location while at the same time keeping the Threat in the Staging Area low, but really?  -1 Threat?  I can't justify that taking up a spot in any deck.  Maybe if it was -2 or -3 I could consider it, but -1?)

A Light in the Dark (Like I posted in another thread, "I personally haven't used Light in the Dark in a deck, but it does seem like an awful lot of resources to just delay engagement with a single enemy one round (and increase the Threat in the staging area), unless you play it and then a The Galadhrim's Greeting or Gandalf to reduce Threat. I suppose the latter could be fairly useful in a few situations during single player, if you happen to have that combo ready to play, and happen to have 5 to 7 resources, but even then it only buys a little bit of time and would put you a lot of resources away from being able to afford stuff to remedy your situation in the long term. Or, maybe by throwing a creature in the staging area, if you have Dunhere it'll let you not only prevent having to eat one attack, but his 3 attack may be sufficient damage whereas an attack of 2 wouldn't be? Or, I suppose if you're somehow getting swamped with creatures it could allow another player to engage it instead of it coming back to you, but really, A Light in the Dark only seems useful in very specific situations. I'm not seeing a whole lot of appeal there, but there could of course be other uses I'm not thinking of.")

 

* Other cards that I think are good (or at least, not terrible), but that I simply don't ever seem to use are: Citadel Plate, Thicket of Spears (why play monosphere?), Stand Together, Longbeard Orc Slayer, Common Cause, For Gondor!, Protector of Lorien, Lorien's Wealth

## 13 [Oshio on May 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46854-what-cards-do-you-never-use/?do=findComment&comment=469491)

Here's my opinions as a Spirit player (backed with Leadership for now, because there aren't enough good cards to do solo Spirit).

The vast majority of their actions are terrible. Light in the Dark is bad. The cards that reduce threat in the staging area are bad. The card that brings heroes back is bad, as someone has mentioned before, you should never really be planning on having heroes die.

That being said, a few cards people have mentioned as being useless surprise me. Will of the West is one of the most powerful cards in the game right now, purely because it allows infinite recursion. It doesn't get played a lot, but once there are more card draw options for Spirit it will prove a very powerful addition. Anyways, I always use 2.

I agree the Lorien Guide isn't as good as Northern Tracker, but to you folks (especially the dude that also said Wandering Took), since when have we been allowed to be picky? Spirit only has THREE guys, how can you play a primarily Spirit deck and not use them? Anyways I'll use Lorien Guide occasionally. Though she's not a staple (and will get cycled out fast once more options are available), I wouldn't say she's a card I "never use".

Totaly disagree.

Light in the dark is a very good card and works very well for solo and coop.You save your heroes from an undefended attack if monsters are more than your ready characters and Dunhere can kill  them in the staging area.Spirit is the less powerfull sphere at combat phase so light in the dark can make your life easier.

Fortune or fate now not only is not bad but it is one of the most powerful cards.Your example is very bad.No one is planning to kill his heroes  but its not in your hand.Your heroes may die and if this huppen you can't do anything  if you play any other sphere.This card can bring back not only your dead hero but also a dead hero from your teamate's discard pile, plus you can use this card for a better score if your hero has many wounds on him.You kill him and then you can bring him back with no wounds on him/her and for those who want to play at tournaments score counts a lot.

Finaly i can agree with you about power in the earth.It is not a very good card.I can say that it is useless.

You are allowed to disagree :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Light in the Dark is situationally useful, but is far down on my list of action cards I'd like to have in a deck. In a dual sphere deck with Leadership there are too many better cards and it gets bumped. In a single sphere deck (well, once more cards are available and you don't have to include everything) it's too expensive for what it does. That's my opinion.

The hero-resurrecting card just doesn't do it for me. It's too expensive. It's extremely specific. And my characters almost never die. I don't want to invest even 2 slots of my deck to an expensive card that is going to sit in my hand 90% of the time. I guess you're right...you can use it to get a slightly better score by killing your guy. But seeing as my Spirit deck ends 90% of it's games at 0 threat that's a pretty moot point.

Saying it's playable is one thing...saying it's one of the best cards in the game is insane. You've got a long list of cards that far exceed it, especially in a Spirit deck (Galadrim's Greeting, Dwarven Tomb and Stand and Fight just to name a few, and those are only the action cards.)

Anyways, disagree if you want, but right now there isn't a single card I'd cut in my Spirit/Leadership deck for either of those. ymmv

I second the usefulness of Fortune or Fate: I like it as a backup, especially if the troll-trap or gandalf isn't showing up in the early game. And if I don't need it - it was emotionally reassuring ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

That's why you have meatshields aka Allies around gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] . Unlike Hummerhorns where a Hero has to take the 5 dmg from its Forced, any character can defend against Hill Troll. Yes, you'll take a hit on Threat, but better than a dead hero if you have no Raise Dead (Fortune or Fate available).

Still early stages for me in LotR (under 10 plays llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] ), but I keep taking a mulligan if the initial hand doesn't contain an Ally, unless that hand is otherwise utterly kick-ass.

Alright, it's definitely got it's uses and it's unique in that it's the only card able to do that, so I'll keep my eye on it. I just like to build my decks to very closely follow a certain strategy. Cards like this - 'just in case' cards, let's call them - don't really fit into my style of play unless it is something that happens to me every game. My heroes very, very rarely die in my games. It might happen once out of every 10 games. I can't afford to use a card that will only be useful once out of every 10 games.

For the Hill Troll example, my Spirit/Leadership deck is completely and totally based around lowering my threat. I almost never get enough threat for the Hill Troll to engage me, so that isn't an issue.

If the card ever had a proactive use - for instance, if a Hero came out that you could destroy to create a huge, game altering effect - this would certainly see play. As is I won't say it's 'bad', but afterall, this thread isn't 'which cards are bad', it is 'which cards do you never use'.

We have the same taste.My main deck is leadership/spirit with Aragorn,Eowyn and Eleanor (some times i use Dunhere at Eleanor's place).I use 3 core sets for my deck and yes my heroes are safe with this deck but i allways use fortune or fate to make a better score if my heroes have many wounds on them lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

Which heroes you use?

Reasons why it's a bad card with the current pool of resources, ie my 2 cents:

1) If you are playing a legal 50 card deck right now, you are dual - sphere, if only one of your heroes is in that sphere, it will be difficult to accumalte the resources to pay for it, or you won't be able to play it at all (if that hero is the dead hero), having 2 heroes in that sphere makes it an expensive card, but relatively less expensive.

2) If you are expending a turn of resources to brind a hero back from play, you are most likely far enough behind (and still facing the threat that send you hero to the grave) that playing the card will not change the outcome of the game.

3) There is no synergy with hero recursion in the current card pool, while that could change in the future, you are much more likely to play a card that will heal or prevent a hero from getting injured then you are to play one to bring the hero back from the grave.  There will be a high percentage of turns, if not games, where you have a dead card in your had or you use said card to discard for travel, Eowyn or something.

Until there are synergies with recursion, from my perspective, I cannot think of a sphere combination where I would want to play this card, because it is very unlikely that it will change the outcome of the game, either way.

Thicket of Spears, Dark knowledge, and the hereos who aren't from the novels. There are probably more that I would never actually use, but I do at least consider the cards when building a deck.

## 25 [Kzer-za on May 17, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46854-what-cards-do-you-never-use/?do=findComment&comment=469973)

It shouldn't be overlooked that the hero comes back readied with Fortune or Fate, meaning you can often get two actions out of him. And there's a little bit of minor synergy with Brok Ironfist. That's not a strong or consistent enough combo to build around, but perhaps there will be more effects like it in the future.

I think you guys are underestimating Rain of Arrows a bit, it's saved me a few times. You get to damage the enemies before they attack, which is important. With Thalin and/or Gondorian Spearman in play it can give you kills more often than you might think. It is more useful in multiplayer where the Tactics player will probably engaging more enemies though.

Thicket of Spears will get a lot better once we can build mono-tactics decks and/or the tactics-resource song comes out.

And Lorien guide is fine. Not as good as Northern Tracker, but still useful, and 3 vs. 4 cost can be a big difference. Wandering Took compares pretty well to most other 2-cost allies too.

Until there are synergies with recursion, from my perspective, I cannot think of a sphere combination where I would want to play this card, because it is very unlikely that it will change the outcome of the game, either way.



The answer is in front of you.Just look your avatar.Aragorn with Celebrian's stone and steward of Gondor and nothing is expensive.Fortune or fate is a great card and the only card which can bring back a dead hero in the core set.

Healing cards can only heal and can't bring your heroes back.If you lose a hero with any other sphere then your hero is dead and you can't do anythink about this.In my spirit decks fortune or fate will allways have a place.

Servant:

One last time, a card that costs 5, has no proactive use and is only useful in a small percentage of games just isn't that great. We get there's no changing your mind. It's a free game. You can play whatever you want, but realize most people disagree with you.

To answer your question, I play Eowyn, Theodred & Dunhere. Aragorn is obviously a solid guy and has the extra Spirit synergy, but his threat is just too high. Theodred is extremely good in the deck with the extra resource generation and low threat.

Everyone Else:

Pretty clear there's no changing this guys mind, so lets keep the thread moving in a positive direction. I'm done talking about Fortune & Fate lol

It shouldn't be overlooked that the hero comes back readied with Fortune or Fate, meaning you can often get two actions out of him. And there's a little bit of minor synergy with Brok Ironfist. That's not a strong or consistent enough combo to build around, but perhaps there will be more effects like it in the future.

I think you guys are underestimating Rain of Arrows a bit, it's saved me a few times. You get to damage the enemies before they attack, which is important. With Thalin and/or Gondorian Spearman in play it can give you kills more often than you might think. It is more useful in multiplayer where the Tactics player will probably engaging more enemies though.

Thicket of Spears will get a lot better once we can build mono-tactics decks and/or the tactics-resource song comes out.

And Lorien guide is fine. Not as good as Northern Tracker, but still useful, and 3 vs. 4 cost can be a big difference. Wandering Took compares pretty well to most other 2-cost allies too.

Yup, I used this once to win a game that was almost lost.

Also, in the third scenario I usually _do_ plan to sacrifice a hero:

After picking up all three objective cards to advance to the third stage I always try to kill off the Hero I attached them to before the turn ends. Since you don't need them to win the scenario, it's best to get rid of them as fast as you can, and this is a perfect method. Only the Lore sphere offers a better method with the miner ally.

LOL.Most people you mean you and an other one ?

Anyway i just wanted to say that this card is not as bad as you think and i don't want to change anyone's opinion.If you feel so bad cause someone else has a different opinion than yours i will not reply again at your posts.I don't write in those forums to play the smart guy or say to everyone else that i am right and you are wrong.I just chat with people and write my opinion and my point of view for this game.

That is smart thinking and a great, easy way to get rid of those cards. Maybe not super easy, but still great thinking. Ive been trying to take advantage of the "Restricted" condition on the cards by attaching more restricted cards to Heroes and discarding the objectives.It's a pretty hit or miss prospect. But I haveyet to win Scenario 3 anyway.

In every ccg / lcg, one of the pitfalls players fall into when building decks and optimizing them is called BCSM (Best case scenario mentality), which is very well illustrated in your post.  It assumes Aragorn is one of your starting heroes, that you drew Celebrian's stone and Steward of Gondor, paid the resources to play them, had a hero die and had F o F in your hand at that opportune time.  That is just not going to happen reliably.  It will be awsome when it happens, but the likely hood of the card being dead in your hands for 10-11 turns is higher then the likely hood of this happening, by a wide margin.

I said in my post that of the cards I don't use at all, F o F is one that I am going to keep looking at as expensions come, because recursion synergies in LCG and CCG's are always there, and usually potent.  If you have a strategy where you expect a hero to die, where it is actually part of the plan to winning the quest, then this card becomes potentially useful (still dead in your hand until the hero actually dies).

I can understand what you say but remeber that i use 3 core sets and i have all cards x3 so i have those 2 cards in my hand almost in every game in the first 5-6 turns.Ofcourse i may play 6 games and never need to use FOF but its not a dead card.If all things goes in the right way i can discard it and use Eowyn's abilitie and if all things goes wrong i can use dwarven tomb bring FOF back and use it on a dead hero.

Anyway as i said in my previous post i don't say that you are an idiot because you don't use a FOF or that i am smarter than you and you must use this card cause i say so.I am just saying that this card is not bad and even if you will use this card 1 per 10 games this one time FOF  can give you the win wen no other card can do this.

ps:maybe my bad English make me sound like an as*** and sorry if i sound like this but believe me everything i say i say it with the friendly way.

I use 3 core sets as well, so having 3 FOF actually increases the chance that it is a dead card in my hand, like you said, if you draw 2 of those in the first 5-6 turns in most games, you drew 2 cards out of a potential 12 that are of no use to you now... (the fact that I can use Eowyn to discard it does not make it a better card, I would prefer having something that I can actually use for it's value vs discarding it for Eowyn purposes).  The point I am trying to make is vs difficult scenario's, the once per 10 games where you use it and it helps, does not offset the times where drawing something else would help forward your cause more.  That is what is so great about card evaluation, it's subjective.  I actually think if that card would win me 1 out of 10 games, I would play it, I just think the probabilities of having that card in my hand at a time where I can actually play it and have it actually swing a game in my favor (vs winning more or loosing less) will be much rarer then that.  It could very well be that our playstyles or decks are different enough that you end up in those situations more often then I do or envision doing.

A card like this does a unique thing, so it can have a very powerful effect on the game state, I just do not see the synergies at this point to either make this occurence probable, or make it swigny enough for the risk / trade off.  Has the card pool expands, I can certainly envision a deck where this card is so critical you would play Dwarven Toombs just to fetch it back, I just don't see it now.

 

I really am not taking offence in anything you say, and hope no one takes offence in what I say, everyone is entitled to there opinions on these things of course.  For me, these types of debates are what I go throuh internally when building a deck, and why I check these boards.

Look, I think you're right in general, but you also make some statements that simply aren't accurate.

The chance that Aragorn is one of your starting heroes is 100% if you intend to use the card as described above.

The chance to have Steward of Gondor in your starting is likewise very high, because it's simply one of the best cards you can have on your starting hand. If you have three copies that chance is 57.45%. If you don't have it right away and then do a mulligan, the total chance increases to 84.31%!

The chance to also have Celebrian's Stone right away is lower, of course, but also not strictly necessary. You could just as well attach the Steward of Gondor to a Spirit Hero to have sufficient resources to play FoF (should you happen to draw it before drawing CS).

I have already pointed out a scenario where it might be part of your strategy to sacrifice a hero at some point. If it isn't and you included FoF in your deck, anyway, it can become part of your strategy as soon as you draw it. It is only a bad card to include in your deck, if you already included 50 cards that are all strictly better. At the moment, given the number of available cards, I don't see that being the case.

Having said all that, the cost 5 event cards are among the cards I rarely use. Imho, the best of the bunch isn't even FoF, it's the Leadeship one that allows you to ready all characters. The Lore one is probably the worst of them.

If you are playing with a fifty card deck, those numbers seem to be quite a bit off.  Unless I am doing something wildly incorrect, you have about 33% chance of pulling the card in your first six cards.  If you assume a mulligan if you don't draw the card, your odds increase to almost 58%.  Decent odds, but not a sure thing, and not 84%.

Yeap and this is the best way to use it.I use grim resolve wen i need to commit all my characters to quest and then i use grim resolve to ready all my characters for attack or defence.I use this combo wen i play the second scenario and i want to to have as high wp as i can with Aragorn,Eowyn and Faramir to pass quikly the 2b phase of that scenario and then ready my heroes to fight at the last part.

no card is a total waste , they all have a use .



I agree that all cards have a use. But some cost too much. And for some cards, they are useful in too rare a circumstance. Having to concern myself with a limited resource pool every turn makes me look hard at just how much use I will ger out of a given card, compared to the cost.

That's true, that some cost too much or are too situational. But with the limited card pool we have you don't have much choice. My friend and I have decided upon mono-sphere decks for cooperative play after having tried dual-sphere. With 3 of each card, Tactics and Lore only have 48 card decks. Leadership can use some leftover Spirit cards, and Spirit can use leftover allies with Stand and Fight. As such, I can't wait for HFG to finish T/L and prune some less than useful cards from the others.

You're right. The first number I gave already included the mulligan, i.e. it's 57.45%. So, the 84.31% would be the chance after a second mulligan...

That's what you get for not adding comments to your Excel sheets sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]

Still, it's pretty good odds.
