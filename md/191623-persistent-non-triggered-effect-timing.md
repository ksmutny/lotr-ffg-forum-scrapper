Hey guys.. not so much a question.. more looking for confirmation here.... See if you can follow my terrible explanation and let me know where I go wrong!
 
If you can think back to "The Redhorn Gate" there is a few interacting persistent effects that are not triggered, they are "always on".

So all these effects... are "always on".

 

Dain = +1 Will (untapped)

Freezing Cold = -2 Will (when attached)

Caradhras = -1 Will (To Questers when in travel location)

Quest Card = 0 Will characters discarded.

 

1) Now... as far as I remember unlike responses and all that, there is in fact no order for how these effects resolve. You simply apply the effects as a sum, and then after all the effects are accounted for, you have a result.

 

So, you do not choose any "order" to resolve these effects.

 

The reason this counts is that if you DO resolve by order then depending on the order you choose Dain will save characters from ever having 0 Will, and other orders will end up giving 0 Will to characters.

 

2) We all know that characters can not go below 0 Will, but during the calculation of Persistent Effects they CAN go under. If you are under zero after all effects are calculated then you round up towards 0.

 

This matters because if you can never go below 0 Will, Dain will always bounce any character to 1 Will (while he is untapped)

 

So... am I close, or should I be hanging my head in shame waiting for 6 of the best trousers down?

I think you have to add/substract any of your WILL-Values and check the result. If the result <= 0 its 0.

You're right in that these effects are always on, Dain will save a 0 WP dwarf by giving him +1 WP as long as Dain remains ready.

 

If that same dwarf has -2 WP on it, it'll get discarded.  Its functional WP will be 0.  That's -2 + 1 from Dain = -1, rounded to 0 for game function--- not [-2 rounded to 0] +1 from Dain = 1.

Wait, the OP asked "do my characters die".. and the real answer is YES to any character with WP two or less right? (the effects net to -2 WP for any character with freezing cold attached)

 

The answer is not "Dain will save your characters that hit 0 from the other effects".... correct?

If a Dwarf has 1 WP and has Freezing Cold attached to it, the end result is 0 WP even with Dain ready.  Discarded.

 

If a Dwarf has 2 WP and has Freezing Cold attached to it, the end result is 1 WP with Dain ready.  There is no time point where the Dwarf is mechanically considered to have 0 WP (consider the math instantaneous), and so he will not be discarded by the quest card effect.
