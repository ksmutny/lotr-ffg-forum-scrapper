When Haradrim Elite enters play and attacks (from the S.A.) do we deal him a shadow card ? Same as the first enemy reveald from the E.D. in the third Peril in Pelrgir Quest Card…I thought they wouldn't because they don't engage anyone and most importantly there's nothing that specifies to give them a shadow card (while card that receive a shadow card for a special attack always have it written on their text…like Haradrim Elite's shadow effect)…

This is a common source of confusion.  But it was clarified in the FAQ -- attacking enemies always get a shadow card.

Official FAQ:

 

"(1.26) Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase
 
If an enemy attacks outside of the combat phase, it is
still dealt a shadow card at the beginning of the attack.
Then follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 “Combat” in the
rules."

I guess I'll have to read the new faq. Thank you for your answer !
