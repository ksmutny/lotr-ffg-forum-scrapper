Galadrilel is discarded at the end of the round. Children of the Sea works at the end of the round. Can i shuffle Galadriel back to my deck before she is discarded?

Nevermind, Children work at the end of the phase.

 

 

Anyway, Elf-stone can bypass leadership resource match and summon her but it will not let me use her "when played from your hand" effect, right?

Yes, Elf-stone bypasses the necessity to have a spherematch. And it will indeed not trigger her response, as it is played from hand indeed.

You are totally correct. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So yeah, this is a great combo! Unfortunately I'd probably be most likely to use this in a deck where I'm using Hero Galadriel!

There are a lot of 1x cards and many of them are single use cards. Doesnt make much sense to me.

Well I'm trying to keep the numbers down and I don't like having multiple copies of unique cards if I can help it. A little consolidation might help but as this is a solo deck, I'm trying to have it be flexible and able to cover a lot of bases at once. It's done pretty well on Nin-in-Eilph and The Ring Goes South. It does have some trouble with card draw though...

I modified it a bit. Took out Elrond's Counsel since Island Amid Perils does the same thing.
