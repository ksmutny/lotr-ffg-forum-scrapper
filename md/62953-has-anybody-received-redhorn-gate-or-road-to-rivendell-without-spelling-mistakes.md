Hi,

 

I am planning to  buy the Redhorn and Road to Rivendell extensions real soon. I am thus wondering if anybody has received them without the hero "Reponse" spelling mistakes?

I would prefer to buy them without that mistake if possible (even though some have suggested that the mistake will make those cards valuable some day happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]).

You have to wait until they reprint it, sorry.

Just think of it as a charming congenital defect shared by the twins. Hey, there's no genetic screening in Middle-earth--how was Elrond supposed to know?!

If no one had pointed it out on this website, I never would've even noticed. I can see why it happened! Lol.

I wonder if that spelling mistake is just going to be limited to the twins, or if it's going to be something that is prevalent throughout the Dwarrowdelf cycle on the heroes.

 Since the twins are pretty much copy-pastes of each other, I bet the error will be limited to the twins.

 Great, now I have to check the cards as I missed this.

The first FFG typo I ever discovered was from the Runebound base set. In Runebound, you are sometimes instructed to make Diplomacy checks, but on a small number of cards, you are instead direct to make a Displomacy check :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Displomacy has ever since entered my vocabulary as an antonym for Diplomacy.

As you'll notice, the Elrohir and Elladan typo is that Response is missing an S. As you'll also notice, Displomacy has been stuck with an uncalled-for S. At FFG, everything evens out in the end :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I agree that your BEST bet is to await a reprint. However, I also caution you that it is also a poor bet. FFG have always answered the adage "if you didn't have time to do it right the first time, when will you have time to do it again?" with "never". Expect any reprint to be exact copies of the original press.

My advice is to just get the packs when you want to, and if a fix is in fact made down the line, simply request replacement cards from FFG customer service. They're very good with honoring those kinds of request.

Double post since we are talking about twins here.

Hi,

Thanks for your replies. I decided to go ahead and purchase both Redhorn and Rivendell. We already won the Redhorn quest. Great.

Elladan and Elrohir are now called "The Reponse brothers"...  lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]
