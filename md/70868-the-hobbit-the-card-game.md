Just clicked on it and it gave me this:

Relive the epic struggle of good versus evil in Middle-earth with The Hobbit Card Game, Martin Wallace’s fast-paced, standalone, trick-taking card game for 2-5 players. Win hands and use the cards you’ve won to deal damage to opponents, or heal allies and help them with extra cards. Each character assigns cards differently, so use your skills wisely! Fight the forces of evil as Gandalf, Thorin, or Bilbo, or smash the hopes of the heroes as Smaug or Bolg, the goblin leader.

The Hobbit Card Game includes:

1 Rulesheet
65 Cards
This standalone card game is not associated with the LCG The Lord of the Rings: The Card…

 

So there we are! It doesn't look anything special, from what little there is to go on…

Actually, reading the description [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=223&esem=1] and seeing the card pictures there, I really don't like the look of this at all! Looks like it's designed for the non-gamer filmgoing crowd, to me… lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Trick-taking = auto-skip.

This is an understatement.

But graphics aside, even the description did not excite me at all.

 Aesthetically, the game is very elegant and the art is of course amazing. I didn't know they had the rights for Ted Nasmith art, one of the best lotr artists… makes me wish they had used some for the lcg, the art is at times a little too digital for me.

FFG is tricky, if you peruse their "store" instead of their "catalog", you will find games that they sell which aren't advertised.

 

I can give you two.  Dungeon Fighter and Sewer Pirats.  No mention of either anywhere on their website, but not only do they sell them, but they are in stock.  So you sometimes have to search in there to see the upcoming games before they are announced.

The Hobbit Card Game seems to be coming out just in time for The Hobbit film this year. The game looks uninteresting.

A different note: I really enjoy the ultra-realistic digital artwork by Magali & co. The traditional isn't "real" enough for me to really engage with it.

Actually, making a "solo variant" for a trick taking game probably isn't very difficult.  You can just deal some other hands, and when it that other "player's" turn, you flip the top card of the other players' "hand" to see what they play.  They are not going to follow suit very well, so in that sense they are 'cheating,' but it can still work, kind of.
