Some locations require "X" progress tokens to be explored, or contribute "X" threat to the staging area.  "X" is always defined in the text box of the card.  If Thror's Key is attached to such a card, what happens to "X?"  The FAQ says X is 0 if not specified elsewhere -- does this mean a location such as The Mountains' Roots would be instantly explored?

Hadn´t thought about that but your reasoning does seem sound. Can´t see why it shouldn´t work like you describe it.
