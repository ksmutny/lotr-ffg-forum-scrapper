This cards says to choose a player, then at the end, "... have the chosen player draw 1 card each time he attacks and destroys an enemy this phase."

If another player with Ranged destroys an enemy engaged with that player (without help from that engaged player) does the chosen player still get to draw a card?

No.

But this makes me think of a related question: 2-player game with A & B. B has been targeted by Knife-work plus the kicker. A has an engaged enemy.

Now A declares an attack against the enemy. B joins in with a Ranged character. The enemy dies. Does B draw a card?

Knife-work is worded "…each time he attacks and destroys an enemy this phase." Does this apply:

* to B's character, in which case has he should draw a card in the posited situation, or

* to B the player, in which case he did not declare the attack, so arguably he shouldn't draw a card…?

In other words, should the "he attacks" be interpreted as "he participates in an attack" or "he declares an attack"?

In the example above, the targeted player would draw.

To me it should be interpreted as "the player declare an attack". So B. To remind here is the text:

Action: Choose a player. Each enemy engaged with that player gets -1 Defense until the end of the phase. Then, the players as a group may spend 2 Lore resources to have the chosen player draw 1 card each time he attacks and destroys an enemy this phase.
