# [Quest Completion](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86540-quest-completion/)

I have just had the situation in Journey down the Anduin where I had sufficient tokens on the first quest card, but had not defeated the Troll.

 

By the time I had defeated the Troll I had a location in the Travel area on which I did not have all of the required travel tokens.

 

So I had all of the travel tokens on the quest, had defeated the troll, but was short of tokens on the currently active quest. When do I consider the quest completed? Immediately or only after I have all of the location tokens.

 

Thanks

Phil

the locations do not have to be completed to complete a quest stage or even a whole quest (unless it says otherwise of course)

as soon as the troll dies you go onto 2b

Great thanks.

Still didn't quite manage to get through though!

 

Going to try a Tactics/Spirit deck for a change next.

Official (Retarded version)

Quest cards instantly resolved as soon as there requirements are met, quest counters and any text qualifiers.. (like killing Shelob Spawn for example). This means that you can finish your quest with a ton of monsters out or unexplored locations. This is not only ugly, but thematically wrong.

 

Limit the Encounter Deck Fix

One way many people get around this is to stop drawing from the encounter deck after the end game requirements are met. Then play until the staging area, location area and the combat zone is clear. Others like to reduce the encounter deck draw, so the game is still in motion. I like this better. So in a 2 player game you reduce to 1 draw, in a 3 player 2 draws etc. This way the quest feels completed and that you have finished.

 

Try it.. looking at a clear table is so much more satisfying than doing a cowards will run to the end of the quest leaving all the threat you were to lame a player and deck building to deal with. One always leaves you thinking you somehow cheated.. a clear table feels like you have beaten the quest and answered all threats.

That's the first I've ever heard that.   By "many people," do you mean "a person?"

maybe it is just localized to my meta. One guy at the store did it, then everyone saw how good it was and now everyone that plays dose it.. I know over 20 real life players that use these methods.

It's a cool idea.  Sometimes it's very thematic to leave the table full of enemies though! (Moria comes to mind)
