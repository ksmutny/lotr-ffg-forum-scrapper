Hey I'm wondering if I got the core set and started with that.  Could I just buy the expansions in order over time to catch up and still play the game like it was played when it was originally released.  there was no special event that was I one time only thing or anything?  Like the league kits for WH that were sent to stores ect.  I also noticed a epic scenario during LCG days a few months back.  I read that was just nightmare level and then run through all 3 quests or something..

You can start with the core set and add expansions at the pace you would like (assuming continued availability).  You might consider picking up A Massing at Osgiliath.  It is a print on demand purchase through the FFG online store (I'm assuming you could get it on eBay or such also).  It was a scenario introduced at a Con a few months ago.  It has no player cards - only a stand alone encounter deck.  And it is fun to play. 

Enjoy!  It's a great game

 Buying the expansions in the order with which they were released probably sounds like the perfect plan to me, but here's a link to a similar thread with some more ideas on the topic javascript:void(0);/*1320365875864*/ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=567133]
