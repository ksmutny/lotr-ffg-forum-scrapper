 Hill Troll says extra damage becomes threat, Frodo has the option to turn any damage he takes into threat. How does this play out? 

Scenario 1: Frodo blocks the 6str attack but uses his ability. All Troll dmg is cancelled so Troll's ability does not apply. However, how much dmg is actually canceled? All 6 of the Trolls STR? The trolls STR minus Frodo's defense (4)? Only the dmg that Frodo can sustain (2)?

 

Scenario 2: Same questions as above, but for an undefended attack where the damage is given to Frodo then canceled.

If he blocks you subtract his defense. So he would get 4 damage. You can cancel all 4 damage and turn it into 4 threat.

If the attack is undefended, you will raise your threat by 6.

Has this been confirmed? Since Frodo can only receive 2 damage, do you ever need to raise your threat by more than 2?

I guess if someone attacks him for 6, then if you only cancel 2 damage, you'd still die. I guess it makes sense either way.

Muemakan is correct. (The amount of damage that can be cancelled is not limited by Frodo's hit points)
