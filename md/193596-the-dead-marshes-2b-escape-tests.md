Hi folks,

 

just started playing again with The Dead Marshes. A question about timing:

 

- Stage 2B reads: "after this stage is defeated, the first player..." and you're asked to pass an Escape test against Gollum dealing n. cards, where n is the number of resources on Gollum

 

- Gollum forces you to resolve an Escape test at the end of the quest phase

 

We played this so that the Stage 2B condition is resolved as soon as it triggers, hence, if happens during Quest Phase, it happens before the quest phase ends, so that the sequence is:

 

a) test Escape as per Stage 2B

b) if you fail a) test Escape as per the Gollum card

 

Is this correct?

 

(may I add the quest is really the worst in the first cycle?)

 

Thanks, as always, for help

That sounds right to me.

I agree, that's how I've been playing it.

To chime in with two more reasons why this is correct  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] :

 1. Defeating the quest occurs when progress meets/exceeds question points.  This happens before the end of the quest phase
 2. Both of these are Forced effects, in which case First player gets to decide the order.

Richard,

 

I thought about the first one, but didn't consider also the second reason. Thanks for chiming in, much appreciated
