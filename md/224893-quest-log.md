Hey,

 

So I really like the idea of the LOTR LCG quest log, but I see a bunch of broken scripts on a lot of the pages. Is this resource still supported/used at all, or is there something better that people prefer?

I moved on this topic in this place (https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224453-actualization-of-lotr-quest-log/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224453-actualization-of-lotr-quest-log/]). I wanted to contact with FFG, and ask somebody about quest log. But I don't know how to contact with them.

I asked Sydtrack the author of RingsDB about it, and he said that he is working on RingsDB quest log, and he finish it "soon".
