I have received clarification from Caleb as to which framework effects occur at the beginning and which do not occur at the beginning of their respective phases.

 

1.  Resource Phase: Each player adds 1 resource to each of his heroes’ resource pools, and draws 1 card.

2.  Travel Phase: Players may travel to 1 location if there is no currently active location.

3.  Encounter Phase: Each player may choose and engage 1 enemy from the staging area.

4.  Combat Phase: Deal 1 shadow card to each enemy.

5.  Refresh Phase:  Each player refreshes all cards he controls.  Each player raises his threat by 1.  First player token passes to the next player on the left.

Wait, what happens before the example in #2? Is there an action window there or something? I thought Mariner's Compass was worded as a response precisely because there wasn't one.

Nothing happens specifically, but all effects (Passive, Forced, and Response) that say "Happens at the beginning of the travel phase" will necessarily come before the decision to travel. 

 

Effects that happen at the beginning of the resource phase (and combat phase and refresh phase) can only come before adding resources and drawing a card if they are a passive effect.  The player would get to choose to resolve the framework effect or choose to resolve any non-framework passive effect first.
