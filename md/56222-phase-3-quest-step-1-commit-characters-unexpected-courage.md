During the Step 1 (commit characters) of the Phase 3 (quest) can you take actions other than the "commit character" action?

For example could you use the Unexpected Courage action to ready an hero and commit him again?

Turn sequence is a bit vague still on the Quest Phase in particular, but putting that aside, committing for the second time doesn't really do anything since Willpower is only counted once regardless of how many times you committed. There is Theodred I suppose who could give 1+1 resources as far as Heroes go, of course Northern Trackers with an Ally-readying effect could be even sicker.

You can play actions during this step, but you cannot double commit characters. You have to commit all characters at once, so even if you did ready a character it would be too late to commit any more characters to the quest.

Also, like Dam said, you wouldn't gain any extra willpower from this anyway.

And once committed, characters remain committed until the end of the Quest Phase unless uncommitted by a card effect (encounter card will say something like, "Choose a character, that character is no longer committed to the quest but remains exhausted" or something like that).

So standing a committed character wouldn't remove them from the quest, they'd still be committed but standing.
