Last night I was half asleep and I tried to make a new deck with Leadership/Tactics and Aragorn - Gimli + another red hero.

 

 

I don't know what happened to my brain but I ended up with only 12 tactics cards in the whole deck. Worst fail I think I have ever made when it came to deck building. Hahaha.

haha, i constantly do these things, like making a deck then swapping a hero out, such as a hobbit, but forgetting to take all the hobbit-focused cards out....so when i draw them in my set up hand i think...oh...bugger

It is discouraging or even kind of silly where after I build a deck play 1 quest with it, and think to myself "well that was a disaster" and scrap it.

Happens to me very often pharmboys .... Total waste of time. Sunday i first played peril in pelargil, i made four decks i discarded before even stage two cause i did not like

Sometimes i feel like i spend more time building decks than i do actually playing.  If theres any 1 deck that lasts me longer than a week, then thats really something

Me, too, I love building decks and have so many different decks already that I lack the time to test them all :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Yesterday night I had a go with my newly brewed tactics/lore deck and suddenlty there popped a Snowbourn Scout [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1016] up in my starting hand...lol...I have no idea how that even got in there! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

i think its a good thing, and i think most people if they thought about it, would probably find they spent more time building than playing...it is the joy to be found in making little tweaks to a deck, and thinking, yes this is as good as i am going to get it, and then a spoiler preview comes out and you think 'i need that card!!'

and then you have to figure out which you are going to discard from your deck to add the new one

You're not alone guys. It's obvious that deckbuilding and deck-tweaking are the most time consuming and fun-bringing aspects of the game; the small tweaks can be especially funny, ie. when you ditch Elrond in favor of Lore Aragorn and watch Vilya times two in your starting hand.

lmao. Now THAT is funny, though I relate to the Vilya sticking around too. Happens too frequently to me with the diff Glorfindel attachments.
