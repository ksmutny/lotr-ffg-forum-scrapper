Anyone know if those nightmare packs are getting released as print on demand or something. If so any idea when?

So far it looks like it's just a tourney kit prize.  1 per pack I think.  none on ebay right now

At the moment you can only get them if you're a "store" to encourge people to travel to play and create a scene (the way the competitive lcg's all have).

 

Personally I think it's missing the point of this game and they won't get much interest until people can play them at home. However the home release hasn't been anounced yet.
