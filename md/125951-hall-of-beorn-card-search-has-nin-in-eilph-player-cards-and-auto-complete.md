# [Hall of Beorn Card Search has Nin-in-Eilph player cards and auto-complete](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125951-hall-of-beorn-card-search-has-nin-in-eilph-player-cards-and-auto-complete/)

I don't have time to scan the encounter cards, but here is text and images for the player cards:

Also, you might notice that the next time you visit the search engine it loads a bit slowly. This is because your browser will be loading a javascript file filled with names of player cards for the auto-complete feature. After the initial load, your browser should cache this file, so the slowness should be a one-time event. Now, when you type in the query box, autocomplete suggestions will be displayed. Only player cards and unique encounter cards are included, since I don't suspect people are often searching for minor encounter cards, and I don't want to clutter the auto-complete file too much. Let me know what you guys think!

We had a 4-player game last week and Haldir and Legolas each had one Rivendell Blade and one Bow of the Galadhrim. The poor trees in The Old Forest didn't stand a chance!

I use Legolas and Haldir two handed (each in different decks) and already run the blade and dunedain marks so will hopefully be able to do the same in most games =)

Did you use Hands Upon the Bow at all? I figure that might be good for me for Legolas considering most enemies engage the deck he is in so the bow will usually only give him +1 but will almost always give Haldir +2

I actually use Great Yew Bow with Legolas in that deck, I just didn't draw it that game. Even so, the blade and the bow make Legolas a real killer. Thanks to unexpected courage, he was clearing the active location almost every round.

Yeah unexpected courage always goes on Haldir or Legolas for me as well. Being able to both use Haldirs Combat Action and then attack normally with him as well is pretty sweet and yeah double progress from Legolas is super nice also

Hey Dan, thanks for working around the orcs and doing what you could here. Looks like your normal source for player cards hasn't pulled through for you yet, huh?

Not yet, but I'm sure that I'll have the rest of the images at some point in the near future.

Heads up: you listed the set as "Nin-in-Eilph" but it's technically called "The Nin-in-Eilph". Missing that super annoying "the" that they like to throw in front of everything.

As a community we seem to have a collective habit of developing acronyms wherever possible, shortening The Hunt for Gollum to THfG and so on.  Still waiting for someone to shorten Trouble in Tharbad.

I think I saw somebody doing it. But the most laughs I got from Glaurung shortening Fortune and Glory on the Board Game Geek (I think) and people freaking out from it  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

Here you go :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

As for omitting the "The" from Nin-in-Eillph, you are correct. I can fix this in the drop down list but the acronym NiE has to stay. As you can see from the link above, changing that would break existing URLs, which I refuse to do. While we're pointing out *unbearable* omissions, it should be noted that I also have "Voice of Isengard" without a "The". VoI just looks and sounds better as an acronym. Creating a search engine might just be my stealthy (and ill conceived) means for forcing broken naming conventions on the community ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I've seen people shortening it but *** gets blocked here, so you never actually see it.

 

See what I mean?

I'm really annoyed that all of the AP's this cycle start with the letter T, except Celembrimbor's Secret. At least Trouble in Tharbad doesn't start with "The". Even without it, it still has 2 T's and The Three Trials has 3!

TTT

T iT (space is intentional to prevent blocking)
TNiE

CS

TAC

 

9 T words in 6 packs. Crazy.
