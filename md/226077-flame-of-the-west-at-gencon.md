Typically when FFG releases/pre-releases a box at GenCon (like the Land of Shadow last year, I believe), what is their supply at GenCon like?  Do they sell out quickly?  What are the chances they would still have Flame of the West by Sunday if, as speculation seems to suggest, it will be at GenCon this year?  I was lucky enough to get into the Fellowship Event on Sunday, but I don't want to miss out on Flame of the West if it's there.

Supplies are usually limited. Try to get to their booth earlier.

Anything they sell out of, they usually restock on Saturday as they are close enough to get shipments from home. I would try to buy on Saturday if you need/want it for Sunday. They brings lots and lots of the preview stuff. Most of it doesn't last til Sunday.
