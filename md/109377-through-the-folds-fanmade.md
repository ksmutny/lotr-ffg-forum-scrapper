Here is my last job. I need to know if the text of the cards are ok. I'm not english, and i dont know if it is all correct. Can you see them and say to me if anything is bad? Thanks.

 

Before relase the fanmade officially i want to check his text. ^^

In a few, i will build the sheet, telling the number of each cards and the alert trait.

 

I have played it and it is hard, and, of course, funny ^^

On bounty hunter card it should be least, not less. And what does this alert keyword do? I don't get it.

Ok thanks.

 

Alert is equal to the number: number of allies or attachment of the player who has most.

 

For example, 2 players:

 

1st player: 2 attachments, 3 allies

2nd player: 1 attachment, 2 allies

 

...so alert = 3

played this last night. Very fun quest. Has a slight scaling problem as it gets easier with more players.. but still a fine effort. You need to make a quest instruction sheet though :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Oh true, multiplayer maybe is easier, they can plan each player no play more than 3 allies neither 3 attachments. True. But it is enough funny to me ^^. I'm thinking about another new fanmade and i hope to finish it before august. Let's see ^^.

 

Sheet of Through of Folds is coming, sure. Before i wanted to know if my english language is ok in all cards.

 

Thanks!

Whenever I see one of your threads Mndela (Mandela?) I don't even read the cards, just look at how pretty they are... your art choices are superb!

## 12 [Mndela on July 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109377-through-the-folds-fanmade/?do=findComment&comment=1142786)

Yes, Mandela, not the Nelsom man, ^^.

 

I only chosed a random name and i added some change (quit out a letter).

 

 

Thanks for your support. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
