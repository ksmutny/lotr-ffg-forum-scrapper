Both Raid on the Grey Havens and The Thing in the Depths explicitly add Captain Sahir and Na'asiyah (in their enemy forms) to the staging area for their debuts in those quests. Will a trap there -- say, Poisoned Stakes -- attach to one of them?

Â 

As I interpret it, all staging-area traps create passive effects. Both of the elite Raider enemies have passive effects that pull them out of the staging area "immediately" after adding them there. But I should be able to choose the order of passive effect resolution and therefore attach Poisoned Stakes to one of them (of my choice), right?

Yes.
