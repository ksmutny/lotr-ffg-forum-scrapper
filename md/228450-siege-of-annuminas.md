I was wondering if there would be any way to pick up some of these Fellowship event kits at some point?  I contacted the gaming stores around my area and none of them seem interesting in participating.  Since today is the last day that kits could be ordered, if I read it right, I just wanted to know if those of us that are unable to attend would be able to pick up a kit due to lack of events in our area?  Thanks.

FFG will eventually print Siege of Annuminas on-demand, but you'll never get the playmat or the promo card unless you find a seller.

Try ebay... but you should wait a little bit when prices go down.
