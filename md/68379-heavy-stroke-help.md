# [Heavy Stroke? Help!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/)

## 1 [GhostWolf69 on August 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=666847)

Can some one help me out here?

"Heavy Stroke

Response: After a Dwarf deals X damage to an enemy during combat, deal and additional X damage to that enemy. (Limit once per phase.) "

How the heck would I know exactly how much damage came from the Dwarf if multiple characters are attacking?
Can I choose freely up to the Dwarf's Attack-limit?

im not 100% but i think you take the dwarf damage dealt only, and deal it again, not counting of course the damage by others

so for eg. gimli and aragorn deal 5 damage collectively, with aragorn dealing 3 and gimli 2 - you play the event and take the two damage and deal it again

im interested on others insight to this

Yes.

My question though is this:

If three characters attack; only one dwarf; Attack Values 2+3(dwarf)+4 = 9
Defense of the Enemy is 4…. Damage would be 5.

Is it up to me as a player to simply declare 3 out of those 5 as being "dealt by the dwarf" and add another 3?
The card is referring damage. Not Attack Value. Yet Damage can come from multiple Characters and some of it is deducted along the way…

I'm only confused because this is the only card that would have me track how much damage (not attack value) comes from what character.

Or, so it seems…

 This is an interesting question. Say the enemy has 3 defense, so does Aragorn's attack take the defense to 0 and Gimli deals 2 damage? Or does Gimli take the defense to 1, and Aragorn has one attack point absorbed by the defense and 2 points go to damage? I'm inclined to believe that the designers intended this to be used only when a dwarf attacks alone.

This is exactly my question. :-)
I would like to believe it is up to the player to decide… but it could be multiple players involved… so who decides? First Player?
This discussion could be even more complicated if you consider some effects linked to "killing".

For example:

Dvalin

Response: After Dwalin attacks and destroys an Orc enemy, lower your threat by 2.

If Dvalins Attack was only used to "reduce enemy Defense" while another character actually killed the Enemy…. can I still trigger Dvalin's effect?


Personally I would hate having to split attack values up in details like this so I'm hoping for a "yes" to this question as well.

I already asked this here and the answer by most players was that the whole attack value counts. It's simply not possible to determine the damage that a single character caused in a multi-attack. Say the defender has 3 points damage and you attack with Aragorn and Gimli - that's two points damage, but dealt by which character? Is a player able to choose, so that Aragorn cancels the defense and Gimli causes the damage?

That would be even simpler… but it would also open up the possibility of having HUGE damage values since you practically double it…. that would make this card awesome. *worried look*

This is very sloppy thinking.. and it is not your fault the card is terribly worded. Though this seams like typical "player picking the best option".. not the most logical or most "correct".

How I play it is kinda like what rich said..  and it should be noted there is nothing official, so this is just my own house rule.. but… … .

If Aragorn and Gloin attack a monster with 3 defence… then as Gloin is unable to place dmg at all then you can not double it. So the card is not usable. What I am getting at that untll we get a rulling from Nate.. the way I am playing this card is that the dwalf needs to be able to place dmg by himself with no help form others, regardless of being used in joint attacks, and it only doubles HIS damage. So say you attack a 1(D) / 5(L) monster with Arragorn and Gloin… that is 4 total dmg (3+2-1) but Gloin can hit it for 1 by himself.. so you can use this card to double that and make it 2.. so it is 3+2-1+1 = 5

This card defiantly needs a official ruling

Huh… that's a third or fourth option / interpretation.

I see it's not "just me" that has problems with this card. Comforting, in a way.

I don't agree with your house rule, but that's okay.

Reason is that it would lead me to think you don't use Dwalin's ability either unless he can slay an enemy single-handedly… and surely this cannot be the case?

BTW I'm not agreeing with adding it all up and double it either. And my own house-rule is not perfect either…. all of these attempts to fix the holes (mine included) seem like they just bring up more questions.

not slay… put at least 1 point of dmg on by himself.. and then the card doubles THAT dmg witch is added to the total dmg that is normally calculated in a joint attack.

But yeah it is a house rule so i am not saying this is correct.. it just feels right to me.

I heard you. but I switched card (sorry for the confusion). The Dwalin card says if he "attacks and destroys an enemy"…. It doesn't say he has to attack alone… so how can you tell if Dwalin slays anything if there are multiple attackers involved? Would you apply the same thinking as you did on "Heavy Stroke" comparing Dwalin-by-him-self first to see if the Response is valid?

I wouldn't.

Basically what we are talking about / asking ourselves here is the this:

What is the difference (if any) between "dealing damage" and "participating in an attack that deals damage".

What is the difference (if any) between "attacking and destroying an enemy" and "participating in an attack that destroys an enemy".

I thought we were talking about heavy stroke…. Dwalin's ability is like Lego's ability and he just need to participate in the attack. This is nto related to heavy stroke at all.

I disagree. Legolas ability explicitly says "participates in an attack". Dwalin's ability does NOT. Hence my confusion and the topic at hand.

If damage dealt from a specific character triggers an effect…. what happens when that character "participates"?

In Legolas case it is obvious because Participation is enough to trigger it.

In the case of Dwalin it is not so obvious.

Heavy Stroke suffers from exactly the same ambiguity. IMO.

1) I think that there is a difference… This card is cast on a single character.. and triggers of THAT characters dmg. This is obviously (imo) a different game state than a combined attack. The card can only hit dwarfs, and only one at a time it seams pretty clear to me that this means the effect needs to be separated. Even if you attacked with two dwarfs, the event can only target one of them… So by definition of how events work.. you have to only count 1 of the attacking dwarfs. (that is how i see it anyway)


2) If you are trying to lift a box, and 2 people lift it together, then the box has been lifted up.. regardless of how much each individual has contributed.. this is the same for destroying a monster. The end result is the monster is destroyed and Dwalin / Lego DID attack it.. so their effects triggers.

this is a good point but our conversation is going faster than I can type!! I'll copy my other post to get everythign in order again..

Now granted the card dose not have the participate text, but

Response: After Dwalin attacks and destroys an Orc enemy, lower your threat by 2.

So… it is saying that he has to attack an orc, and the orc has to die. That is it.. participating or attacking solo dose not change the trigger events in any way.

I see your point and I agree on how you resolve Dwalin's ability. That is the way I'm playing it too. But for clarity's sake they could have worded it as "participates" if that is what they intended… just like they did on Legolas. It's inconsistent to have different wordings when you mean the same thing, and causes confusion. At least for me.

In the case of Heavy Stroke I don't agree with your resolution though. But that is okay, we all have our own house rules when the game doesn't provide us clear guidance.

I still think the two cases boils down to the same issue though:

If the card doesn't say "attacks alone" and doesn't say "participates in an attack", but still clearly target one specific character… then how should we play it?

Neither Heavy Stroke nor Dwalin's ability is clear on that.

It could also be interpreted that Dwalin has to Destroy the Orc.

As RichSabre has suggested, we need an official answer from Nate.

Not sloppy thinking, but trying to approach an interpretation that makes sense. Your interpretion doesn't make much sense, as this card would be incredibly weak. It costs 1 resource after all, while "Khazad-Khazad" costs nil resources. The latter gives a dwarf a boost of 3 ATT which is a big help against strong enemies, while "Heavy Stroke" works against weak opponents only which you can kill easily without using this card..

When I asked the answer last time the answers were like "works like Legolas and Dwalin".

## 22 [schmoo34 on August 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=667012)

I believe people overthink things.

I do like the last response making the argument that it would be a devalued card.  Let's look at this from a practical perspective.  When would a person want to play heavy stroke?  Answer:  When fighting a creature with high hit points.

 

How many creatures have high hit points but also low defense so as to allow a dwarf to actually damage that creature on its own, solo?  I can't think of any at all.

 

So the only creatures that this card is worth using on are those which have 2 or 3 defense like hill trolls, ungoliant's spawn, the jailor, the name is eluding me but it is the orc who gets an additional resource token every time he attacks.  Those are the cards you WANT to use it for and Gimli can't damage a single one of them on his own unless he is near death.  In fact, the only dwarf who can is the battlemaster. 

 

So the card would be reduced to ONLY a card which can be used with the battlemaster or a near-dead Gimli.

 

Therefore, from a logic perspective, not from a literal English perspective, I am left with no other conclusion than the spirit of this card was to be used to double damage made by the dwarf regardless of how many others also attacked; i.e. if Aaragorn reduces defense to 0, Gimli gets to do 4 damage instead of 2.

 

And if that is not enough logic to convince you, it is a tactics card and tactics needs some love…and they deserve to have powerful cards…so perhaps that appeals to your emotional side of the brain if logic is not your strongsuit.

## 23 [Bullroarer Took on August 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=667083)

 Since these things are happening simultaneously, wouldn't the first player get to decide the effective order?  And so a smart first player would apply Aragorn's damage first followed by Gimli's.

(I still think Heavy Stroke shouldn't have been dwarf only.)

I agree with the above interpretation, particularly since the rulebook seems to discourage separating character's attack values.  Per page 20, "A player may declare multiple characters as attackers against a single enemy, pooling their attack strength into a single value." (emphasis mine)  This leads me to believe that FFG would not design a card that would require identifying how an individual character's attack strength would be allocated amidst multiple attackers.

But, yeah, +1 for an official ruling.

As I said this is how I house rule it i never claimed it was correct…. I just think it makes way more sense. the way I do it and I do not think we will be changing until there is an official ruling

The argument that it is not as powerful relative to the cost of Khzad Khzad is not an argument.. card costs do not need to be relative or balanced. Just because Khzad Khzad is cheaper doesn't mean this should be the same cost or be relatively as powerful (or more powerful)

Neither is the idea that high HP monsters have high defence argument. In fact this is one of the reasons i like the card as we play it. Say you are fighting the Watcher at 7defence. There is many ways to get an attack form a single dwarf above 7.. the easiest one would be gimli, but there are marks + Support of the Eagles can also easily get to this power. Getting over 7 defence is a huge effort so that extra dmg you can get from this card is a HUGE bonus.. and makes the card extremely valuable.

Either way.. I simply do not buy the argument.. "well the card is not as powerful as I would like it to be so it should be able to be cast in this situation were it is a much stronger card"

Especially when my rule variant is a common and repeatable game situation, that works game play wise and thematically AND match the rules.

richsabre said:

Exactly… but it doesn't say that dose it?

Our house rule is the only interpretation that is exact to the rules based on the CARD text, and as the FAQ and RULE book says "the golden rule" witch is that card text overrides ALL over game rules at the time they are read during effect payments and resolutions. So it is completely irrelevant how other attacks are calculated. As the card text over rides this.

Events are like passive global .. well events.. . You cast them and the game world changes for a second. Then after the event starts the resolution of the event begins and "triggers" of a game situation.

Response: After a Dwarf deals X damage to an enemy during combat, deal and additional X damage to that enemy. (Limit once per phase.)

This event targets a SINGLE dwarf, and then the event triggers of the condition on that SINGLE dwarf's dmg…

I think this is pretty clear cut…

 Confused here. First it doesn't really matter if the text on a card reads PARTICIPATING as per the example with Dwalin and Legolas. And now it's suddenly very important? If you treat Dwalin the same way as Legolas then there obviously shouldn't be a problem reading the text on heavy stroke as PARTICIPATING. Else, please clarify :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

My previous point (and I think the point of some of the others in this thread) is that Dwalin is also a SINGLE dwarf.

His event triggers on "Dwalin attacks AND destroys an Orc."

That's where our confusion lies.

But I know… we've been here before and we don't have to agree. The rules (card texts) ARE ambiguous and should be officially RULED.

Until then we all have to house rule what we think is best.

 I'm not sure the golden rule has to apply here. If there's a way for both the standard rules and the card text to be met, there is no conflict in which to call upon the golden rule. I don't think this card is clear enough for us to have any idea if it is contradicting the rules or not.

Incorrect.  When Gimli, Legolas, and Aragorn are attacking together, and their combined attack value exceeds the enemy's defense, the resulting damage is being dealt by a dwarf.  It is also being dealt by a Ranger, and a Silvan.  The same value; multiple traits.  This interpretation aligns to both the card text, and the rules.

You're welcome.

I complete disagree with that.

The dmg is not being done by the dwarf.. it is being done as a combines attack by all the characters.. there is no way to tell were the dmg is coming form and who did what… IF this was that case for the card it should use the word "participate" as stated by others or a similar keyword.. it doesn't so imo, that logic just completely fails.

If 3 people all jump in the air and you measure the height the jumped combined .. that doesn't mean each individual jumped that same value.

Hm, could it be that easy? That would be the easiest way to do it. I'll laugh my but off if this will be the answer from Nate. Teaches us to over think everything and confuse ourselfs gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

problem is if you start to under think cards, then many of the finer points of the game fall to pieces. not to mention there has been some pretty indepth rulings that have come out of players requesting nate's answer….id hope that he gives us at least an in depth reasoning to his answer that also makes sense in the rules

with all the cards that come out i think it would end up choas if we didnt look indepth at these things

Official Ruling has come down…

Booored:

                    With Heavy Stroke.. did the card mean to say "an attack that a dwarf participates in" or dose it mean the
                    dmg the target dwarf makes IN an attack. Like if you have Aragorn and Dwalin attacking a 1 Defence
                    Monster with 5 Health….

                    Is it…
                   Arragon (3) + Dwalin (2) = 5 -1(Defence ) = 4 dmg + Heavy Stroke (double dmg) = 8 dmg Total

                   Or is it..
                   Aragorn (3) + Dwalin (2) = 5-1 Defence = 4 dmg + Heavy Stroke (Dwalin 2 -1 = 1 dmg doubled (2) )
                  = 6 Dmg total?

                   Thanks in advance

Caleb:

Hi Booored,
The way Heavy Stroke is intended to work depends on allowing players to choose which character's attack value is applied to the enemy's defense value. In your example, the optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply Aragorn's attack 3 to the enemy's 1 defense. So Aragorn is dealing 2 damage to the enemy and Dwalin is also dealing 2 damage, at which point you play Heavy Stroke to double Dwalin's damage and make it 4 for a total of 6 damage dealt to the enemy.

Just to clarify it further, let's say Aragorn and Dwalin were attacking an enemy with 4 defense. The optimal way to play Heavy Stroke would be to apply all 3 of Aragron's attack plus 1 of Dwalin's to beating the enemy's defensse, then Dwalin would deal 1 damage to the enemy that could be double with Heavy Stroke for a total of 2.

Hope that helps,

It wasn't the complex version, it was the only version that made any sense when you step back and see it from a 1000 foot view.

A agree with your last answer to my latest post. Actually I do think this is a pretty logical way to do it and not too complex. A little mix between the two :

That is actually 100% the way we have played it so far and thought it should be played. But I admit that the card text gave little support for the idea, so it was a wild guess.

Glad we don't have to change anything.

## 42 [JanB on August 3, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=668035)

short question:

 

How many damage does an enemy (DEF 4) get,

if Aragorn (3)  and Dwalin (2), who is wearing one dwarrowdelf axe (+1 ATK / 1 damage at the end), attack this enemy and the player plays heavy stroke at the end of the combat?

I think it will be 6, beacuse Aragorn reduces the defense to 1 and Dwalin does 3-1 = 2  damage, after that i have the choice, whichte response will trigger first. 1. dwarrowdelf axe then heavy stroke .. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] -> Dwalin does (2+1)x2 damage.

Is this right?

Isn't the Axe triggered immediately when you Declare Attackers?

I though it was.

EDIT: But it is still an interesting Question though. is that 1 point of damage coming from the Dwarf attached to it or from the Axe itself?

That should maybe answer the question…

there was a thread on BGG that questioned this if you google dwarrowdelf axe- i dont know if it was ever ruled either way

 some said it was, some after the attack resolved

i would like to know the answer if someone has it

 My interpretation is that the 1 damage dealt to the enemy is from the axe, but the +1 attack is being given to the dwarf so it would be doubled by Heavy Stroke.

## 46 [booored on August 3, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68379-heavy-stroke-help/?do=findComment&comment=668064)

 The dmg form the Axe is placed at response speed (instantly) when the enemy attacks. This is similar to how the Gondorian Spearman functions, though that one triggers at response speed when you declare it a defender.

The point of dmg from both these cards ignores the defence value of the enemy and are completely unrelated to ANY OTHER dmg… it is an effect, that triggers and then is resolved.. independently and separate form all other effects in teh game.

As said above, the +1 attack is a passive constant on the character that simply adds to its total attack vale. IF the modified attack value adds dmg then heavy stroke will double that.

The damage is dealt after the attached character attacks, not after the enemy does.  I guess that's what you wanted to say?

i read it as when the character is declared as attacker, not after attack resolution- at least thats what i though booored was saying as he said it was 'response speed'
