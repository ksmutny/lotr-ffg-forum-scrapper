Being that the card says for the first player to choose and shuffle a clue card back into the encounter deck, does this mean that it can be from the staging area as well?  I had a situation in which two clue cards were in play, one of which was attached to a hero.  I chose to shuffle the clue card from the staging area back into the encounter deck.  This also leads to another question regarding this card.  If the clue card had been guarded at the time, could it have been chosen to be shuffled back into the encounter deck or does the fact that it is guarded prevent this from happening?  I assume that when it is guarded, the clue card is treated as an attachment, and it is perfectly acceptable to choose that card to shuffle back into the encounter deck while leaving the formerly attached card in the staging area.  The treachery card itself only specifies clue cards that are "in play."  Any feedback would be appreciated.

 I've played it the same way.  It actually helped out once, because there was a hunter in the staging area so the threat strength of the staging area decreased by two because of the treachery card.

I have always interpreted it as any clue card in play, just like you have, so that means unguarded objectives in the staging area, guarded objectives in the staging area, etc.

Yeah, I had a hunter in the staging area as well.  It's ironic that the enemy's attempt to stop the heroes ends up backfiring.  *lol*

Actually most of the times this card play for you not against you........Only on the last stage with only 1 clue card in play this card can harm you but i have test of will in my hand for this time.

so if a clue is gaurded by an enemy, that enemy stays in the staging area and the clue card can be shuffled back into the encounter deck?  or would the enemy be discarded or since its guarded, it cant be reshuffled?  there seems to be a lot of situations that this card "encounters."

The enemy or location stays where it was (staging, active location, engaged with a player). The fact that it's not guarding an objective anymore doesn't change anything else about its status.
