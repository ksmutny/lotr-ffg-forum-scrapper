Can I travel to Necromancer's Pass [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Necromancer%27s-Pass-Core] if I have 1 or less cards in hand? ("Travel: The first player must discard 2 cards from his hand at random to travel here.")

 

Can I travel to Norbury Tombs [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Norbury-Tombs-TLR] if there are no enemies in the encounter discard pile? ("Travel: Return the topmost enemy in the encounter discard pile to the staging area.")

This type of long winded response is confusing for players looking for a simple straight forward answer.  Please stay on point.

From the rules, page 23:

Travel Effects:: Some location cards have travel effects, which are denoted by a bold “Travel:” trigger on a card. Travel effects are costs or restrictions that some or all players must pay or meet in order to travel to that location. If the players cannot fulfill the requirement of a location’s travel effect, the players cannot travel to that location

So as NathanH says, the answer is no. If something is merely a consequence of travel, rather than a cost, it will be represented as a Response, or a Forced, rather than a Travel effect.
