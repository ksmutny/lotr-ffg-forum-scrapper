The card states: "When Revealed: Attach this card to the hero with the highest threat cost without a copy of Local Trouble attached. (Counts as a condition attachment with the text: "When attached hero exhausts, readies, or triggers an ability, raise its controller's threat by 1.")

My hero who has the highest threat happens to be Beorn. Beorn states, "cannot have attachments." Does this mean the card is simply discarded? Or, is there a distinct difference between "player attachment cards" and "encounter deck condition attachment cards?" I am quite confused on this one. Thanks!

Im pretty sure you cannot attach it to Beorn, do you just chooce other hero with a next high threat level

I am sure that you cannot attach it to Beorn, but that doesn't means it is discarded.

 

It means that it goes to the next eligible targetPublish [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_public/img_edge/spacer.gif]

I wasn't sure about this either, so I asked Caleb. Here is his answer:

 

> Hi Jörg,
> Because Beorn cannot have attachments, he is not a legal target for Local Trouble so you will have to choose a different hero to attach it to. For example, if your heroes are Beorn, Theoden, Hama and Local Trouble is revealed, you would have to attach it to Theoden. If another Local Trouble is revealed, then you would have to attach it to Hama.
> Cheers,
> Caleb

 

And I had so much hoped to make this scenario a bit easier...

He does make it a bit easier - if you draw local trouble 3 times you get to discard the 3rd :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

By the strict language on the cards it should be discarded. Obviously we've entered into another loophole black hole from which logic can never escape.

There is no "if able" wording, so the card goes on highest threat non-immune target available.

Why non-immune? The way I see it, the Local Trouble targets the hero with the highest threat - Beorn. Beorn can't have attachments. Card should not get redirected because there is no language that says it should do so. (Unless there is something in a previously published FAQ that I'm missing.)

Having to choose a legal target for effects is one of the core rules in the rule book - Beorn (like other characters with the immune to rule) isn't a legal target.

There's no system in the game that lets you say local trouble targets Beorn and fails, because it can't even target. If we had a response card that said, target character becomes immune to attachments that would work (local trouble targets a hero, then the hero in response is now immune to attachments so it's discarded).

Which isn't a bad idea for a card by the way.

Because common sense. When Local Trouble is revealed, it's radar is turned on and searches for fittest target. And the thing is - Beorn isn't even on the radar. Because he is immune.

Absurd logic :

 

If you can choose Beorn as a target for local trouble, you could play Thror's Key on an immune location and you would discard Thror's Key.

Or you could play Hands Uppon the Bow on an immune enemy and the only effect would be to lose 1 ressource and exhaust one character.

That I'll buy.

Oh boy, I'd glue that card to my hand to be able to play it whenever I want! :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

Only 2 in the deck, genius.

Kick Local Trouble's butt - include only Beorn in ur deck. Secrecy Beorn deck ftw.

My interpretation of the Local Trouble scenario is the following:

 

In west Pelargir born and raised
On the playground where I spent most of my days
Chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
And said you're moving with your auntie and uncle in Belfalas

 

 

Thats why LT clearly should target Beorn and be discarded afterwards!

Airtight logic is airtight.  I approve!

 

On an unrelated topic, did you see that the NM packs are coming out for the Mirkwood cycle?  I can't wait to get my hands on those fresh prints!
