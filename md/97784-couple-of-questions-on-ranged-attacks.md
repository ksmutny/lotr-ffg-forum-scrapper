1) first off, if I'm playing one player can I still use a ranged character normally during an attack phase or is it only meant for a ranged attack.

2) during my attack phase can I target a creature in staging area?

3) in 2 player, if another person is in attack phase, can I help him with my ranged attack and attack also or do I have to wait for my attack phase to do so? I think I have to wait but I'm not sure.

Numbers 1 and 3 were not posed as yes or no questions!  Communication fail!!

 

1) Ranged characters can attack normally, i.e. non-ranged attacks.

 

3) You may help during the other person's turn, when he/she declares attacks.  Then, if you are able to ready your ranged character through some card effect, you can even attack that same enemy a second time when it is your turn to declare attacks!
