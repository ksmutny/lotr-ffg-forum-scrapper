What would you think if someone( including FFG) would do like a second edition(that uses some mechanics from the first one, from Arkham Horror LCG etc.) or a totally new game, but with miniatures. FFG has miniatures for a lot of products, why for LOTR that isn't a FFG game?

I also said that could be a new game, not a second edition. It is not a ,,the game is dead..." post.

Why should it be?

Why? The Arkham has Mansions, Star Wars has Imperial Assault etc.... Is like a lost opportunity... Lord of the Rings novels/ movies were the theme of some games with miniatures that are quite old now. Also, why to buy the license for LOTR for only one game, when the other Universes have a lot of them...

I would love a lotr game but with minis, something like imperial assault or mansions of madness. perhaps it would compete with descent or they would have to pay more for the right to make a miniature based game.

ffg has the card and board games
-Lord of the Rings: The Confrontation
-The Hobbit Card Game
-The Lord of the Rings: Journey to Mordor
-The Lord of the Rings: The Board Game
-The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game

games workshop has the miniature games
-the hobbit 
-the lord of the rings

Sorry, I mean  LOTR LCG game is the only that still has new content. Correct me if I am wrong! I think if they have the license for LOTR they an do any type of game. I know about Games Workshop, but, sadly ,it is not available in my country, while FFG is. Also I want better mechanics, not just some stats and rolling dice... A really miniature game that is also a card game(Like Legends of Signum, on the Kickstarter).

I'm pretty sure GW had exclusive rights to LOTR miniature games,  so FFG is actually not permitted to make them
