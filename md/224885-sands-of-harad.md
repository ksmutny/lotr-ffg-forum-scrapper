Sorry, but you were too late.

If you'll check the date, you'll find that this thread was posted 2 minutes earlier than the one that has all the discussion going on.

Quite the opposite.This topic was actually posted before the other one. But for some reason the discussion ended up there instead of here.

Edit: Aaand John Constantine informed you of this 2 minuters earlier than me.

Lol, the injustices of forums. Well, at least you tried.

Meh, I don't really care about the street cred for posting first.  I just wanted to get the news out and start the discussion.

I don't know why, but I giggled at term "street cred" being used for the purpose of who posted the news article first :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

He nailed the Gimli 'child playing dress up' look, though.
