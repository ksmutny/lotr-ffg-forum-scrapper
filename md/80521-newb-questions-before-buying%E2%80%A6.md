I would like the wisdom of those that bought the game on a few newb questions before i make the big purchase.

1. It says on the box 1-2 players but also 4 if buy the extra core set.
   Arent the cards the same? other than tokens/tracker what gives?
   (I do know you can have duplicates in decks but can you play with
    the original 1 core set which comes with 4 set decks already??)

2. Can you have duplicate heroes or allies in play?

3. Is there limitation to what minimum/maximum cards can be in a players
   hand?

4. For the scenario encounters if bought two core sets.. do i also place
   and use duplicate encounters within the same deck while playing.. so
   two spiders of the same or goblins etc…

Thank you and cheers

1.  You could get by with 1 core set for 4 players initially.  You'd be short on threat trackers, and probably run out of some of the tokens at times.  However, if you find that you enjoy the game and will be playing more regularly, you'll definitely need another core set.  Not just for the trackers and tokens, but for the cards necessary to build 4 decent decks.  The single-sphere decks in the core set will only get you so far (and not very far, at that).

2.  You can't have duplicate cards in play that are Unique, which includes all heroes and some allies and attachments.

3.  The minimum deck size for "tournament rules" is 50, but if you only have one core set it's tough to come up with a good 50-card deck.  So I'd advise smaller decks until you get another core set and/or some of the expansion packs.

4.  No, only one encounter set is used regardless of how many players.  Note: the encounter decks already contain a variable number of duplicates for each encounter card (fewer of the nasty cards, more of the less nasty cards).
