   Deleted Due to a mistake done on the 3rd Turn.

Just read first few rounds as of now. On round three you play Gandalf even though you only have 4 resources to pay for. You cannot use Radagast's resources to pay for Gandalf.

It seems like a minor point but you would probably be done very soon had you played this right. With no offense, please.

I like Boromir very much but I think high threat is not a way to go into Osgiliath, although I believe you if you say you beat it consistently. Check out my strategy in the other thread if you have time. If I survive the beginning, I usually win in 8 or 9 rounds.

I was Sure I had it right.

took a long time to do it, shame i need to delete it.

still, deck took out MaO a lot of time ( with out the mistake).

seems like Osgiliath is the trickiest on the 1st few rounds if you manage to pass them you will probably win.

You should not have deleted it due to that one mistake, I think. But I am sure you can provide a flawless session. I myself could not find strength to write such a thorough report (and my profession is writing, actually). I admire the patience and precision of those who can.

[edit] And I agree, and I said in my post, I also find the first few rounds very tricky. I can even usually tell from the set up hand what my chances are.
