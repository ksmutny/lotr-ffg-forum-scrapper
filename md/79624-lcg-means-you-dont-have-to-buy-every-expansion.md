Say what?

Old cards in the new expansion? Like a reprint?

 

Care to explain?

I'm also confused about this… What do mean by "old cards"?  And I'm guessing by "new expansion" you are referring to Heirs of Numenor?  Or maybe you are talking about the new versions of the old cards in On the Doorstep, such as Gloin's ally version?

The new hobbit expansion. It contains reprinted cards, it never happens before to the other expansions…

Reprinted cards or different versions of some characters?
