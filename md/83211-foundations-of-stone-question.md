Ok so I was playing FoS and I ended up getting a Lost and Alone so I shuffled Frodo in my deck.  Then a Nameless thing came out and I engaged it and I attached the 3 cards to it and one of the cards was Frodo.  What do I do?  Do I get  Frodo back now and then replaced frodo with another card?  Do I Put frodo in the discard pile and then replaced him with another card?  Do I not replace him but what would his cost be?

Thanks

Khamul

If you got Frodo like this is mean you lost for rest of the game. He will add 0 bonus to Nameless thing by the way. Only one way to get Frodo back is :when you destroy Nameless thing frodo will be discarded and  you can play Fortune of Fate to get him back. Otherwise Frodo is dead.

From FAQ

 

Q: How does the card Lost and Alone (DD 124) work?
What if the hero gets attached to a Nameless Thing
(DD 125) or was my last hero in play?
A: You only put the lost hero back into play if you draw
the hero, whether during the resource phase or through
a card effect. If the hero is discarded or attached to a
card like a Nameless Thing, then treat it like any other
card. In the latter situation, the value of the hero would
be null, since it has no printed cost. If your last hero
gets shuffled into your deck you are not eliminated from
the game; heroes are not considered to be killed unless
they are in your discard pile. You will continue playing
until you either draw the hero, are eliminated through
other means, or the game ends.
