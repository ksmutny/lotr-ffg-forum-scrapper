SoG don't need a nerf (There is the Rod now which uses lots of resources). IMHO it is A Good Harvest, which needs a "clarification". Latter card is used to play SoG in any deck; it only says spend resources of any sphere but it do not mention the (usually) needed "resource match".

If you think a card needs to be nerved, I think the best idea is to just not play it.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

It has been clarified in the FAQ.  AGH can be used to pay for cards of any sphere, but 0-cost cards are not "paid for" and therefore are immune from AGH and still require a match.

Maybe the OP meant that the FAQ would buff some of the dinkier ENCOUNTER cards. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
