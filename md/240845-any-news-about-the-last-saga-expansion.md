A few months have past since the release of the "The will of the West", and yet we don't have any news about "The mountain of Fire", no spoilers, no heroe names...  Do I have missed something or really we don't have nothing?

Anyway, there is an estimated date for this saga Expansion?

There have been no announcements, no, but I think we can be pretty confident it'll be released at GenCon.
