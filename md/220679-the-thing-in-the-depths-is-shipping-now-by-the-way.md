Thank you for the spoilers buddy!

3 Attack spirit hero with ranged is pretty good.

That Tireless Guard attachment feels really weak.

Blacksmith can fetch a discarded breastplate and put it into play for free, but is otherwise kinda weak and situational.

Weapons of war, I like it. It will see some use.

Wise Leader leadership Event could be very good in a proper deck.

I don't know what to make of Snack yet.

> Wow, this pack is... not that good, to be honest.

Had a chuckle out loud while reading this.

 

I think my favorite cards in this pack is da blacksmith. Yes, he is 1/1/1/2 for 3, BUT if you're playing gondor deck, he is 2/2/1/2 for 3 AND if you play your cards right (lawl), he'll compensate 1-2 of his cost, as well with potential to return lost attachment back into play.

> Wow, this pack is... not that good, to be honest. Apart from Eldahir, Sam and the woodman ally I don't see myself using any of these (maybe the blacksmith).

I disagree.

The leadership event is very powerful in a tri-sphere deck.

Weapons of war can complement Blood/Fire decks nicely and it saves up deck space.

Blacksmith is ok in a Gondor deck as the above poster said. The other allies are all good.

Snack seems more and more powerful the more I think of it.

The hero is nice and splashable. Also a cutiepie dale waifu with a hawk, hell yes.

The only dud seems to be the lore attachment, unless I am missing something here. It sucks. But they can't all be winners I guess.

Hero is a qt, I agree. Maybe I was too harsh on the tactics cards. They're pretty decent actually (though that armor's not gonna replace shield on Boromir, or Beregond, or replace Firefoot on Éomer)..

 

I can't see how one can find the Elevenses event powerful. It almost feels like an insult to be honest. You have to pay 1, remove from the quest AND exhaust to reduce your threat a bit? It's like they looked at Spirit Merry, looked and Hobbit Pony, and said "Yeah, we can do worse."

I think the most notable use of the new tactics ally will be to play out-of-sphere attachments once we have more.  Right now, I think the only one that would be worth using it for is Herugrim for Tactics Eowyn, or something.  Citadel Plate is probably the most effective use of the card until (if) we get more out-of-sphere weapons/armor that are expensive.

 

It's meant to combo with Hobbit Pipes.  Pay 1, reduce your threat by (at least) 1 and draw 3 cards.

That's fair, but I'd rather use Peace and Thought and draw 5. I'm just not playing this card in solo, unless we get more Hobbit support later on that would warrant it.

## 18 [Authraw on May 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2232739)

I was a little underwhelmed by these cards at first too, but the more I think about it the more I'm realizing that most of them are pretty neat.

 

I think what I picked up on at first was that these cards don't feel cohesive with one another. Flight of the Stormcaller delivered several missing pieces for both Gondor and Noldor, so I understood the impact of the cards all at once. This pack is all over the place:

 * Equipment of War is just a versatile Tactics attachment. Maybe a better attachment than the Gondorian Shield for those 3D 3HP characters like Denethor and Amarthiul?
 * Lanwyn and the Woodman ally develop the Scout trait a little bit, but there's not much synergy there yet so they're basically just a new hero and a location control card.
 * Sam and Elevensies fill in some missing holes for Hobbit decks. Sam is another unique ally to Sword-Thain to pump up Pippin's and Merry's abilities, as well as some development for the subtheme of raising threat that several of the Spirit hobbit heroes do. Elevensies is another much-needed threat-reduction event to make Hobbit Pipes a little more viable.
 * Eldahir is another expensive Dunedain ally, he grants a little shadow scrying.
 * Master Blacksmith seems like a combo-enabling card--I like the idea of using him to get out-of-sphere attachments down.
 * Captain's Wisdom is even more resource generation in Leadership.
 * Tireless Guard reminds me of Power in the Earth to be honest.

 

Since it's kind of a shotgun of a small amount of support for lots of things, I think it feels like it has a smaller impact, but I think that most of these will see play--just not all in the same deck.

 

Not sure about Tireless Guard though. Exhausting a Scout or Ranger every round to give a location -2? Can anyone think of a place where that card would be useful?

I think part of the reason for the underwhelm is that I the best cards in this pack are mostly the ones which were already spoiled in advance. Lanwyn, Mirkwood Explorer, Eldahir, ally Sam are all pretty neat.

The stuff we didn't know though - well, the Tactics cards are pretty cool, Tireless Guard seems like a dud though. Elevenses is interesting but a bit lacklustre and Captain's Wisdom is going to be kind of niche.

One thing is for sure : if you play Lore nowadays, if you get caught in location lock... you're not playing the right cards!

Would Tireless Guard have been too OP if it instead reduced the location's threat to 0? A repeatable Secret Paths for those nasty 4+ threat locations would be quite useful, but maybe too handy for the cost of just exhausting a character each round.

## 22 [donkler on May 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2232985)

War Equipment: Seems like it is for allies, and there are a lot of nice Warrior allies to choose from. It makes ally Beorn 4 attack 4 defense and 8 HP.

 

Tireless Guard: IMO anything that lets you tweak your questing power after encounter cards are revealed is good. Helps finely tune when you advance stages, explore active locations, and avoid over/under committing your characters.

 

Captain's Wisdom: I feel like it can happen pretty often when you have a hero still ready after the combat phase because you didn't actually reveal any enemies in the quest phase that needed to be defended/attacked. This lets you makes it so their exhaust opportunity isn't wasted. 

 

Elevenses: As others have said, pretty much designed for Hobbit Pipe. However seems like you would want to run it with your Hobbit Ponies so you could put those hobbits immediately back on the quest after their snack and smoke.

Yeah, that'd be way too strong in my opinion.  Honestly, I think it is a weak card because it takes up a slot in your deck, but it effectively converts a Snowborn Scout into 2 willpower that is immune to effects that impact characters committed to the quest or characters that are exhausted.

This + Leadership Denethor = 5 leadership resources in turn 1. 7 in total. Could be 9 along with Grima and Arwen. Insane

 

The tactics ally is meh, specially considering that the extra benefit of the free attachment can only be earned by spending all 3 resources from a same hero, which prevent combos like sneak attack -> free attachment. If you want out-of-sphere attachments you can always do so via "A Good Harvest" instead. The ally could be used to bring 0-cost out-of-sphere attachments though

 

EDIT: Also, what the hell is a "resource action"? Can that card only be used during the collecting-resources phase?

As Rajam alludes to, it would appear that it is a Resource action, which makes it significantly trickier to use than your example. I think it's good design space, but, yeah, definitely more situational. Maybe it's time to break out Spare Hood and Cloak...

Master Blacksmith seems strong to me. Look at his stats with a war equipment attached. You put that in a Gondor deck with Leadership Boromir and Visionary leadership, and you have a serious ally for 3 resources.

Won't be a bomb early game, but mid to late game will be very respectable.

Just noticed that I read Elvenses wrong. Still not a very useful card, that is unless you have 2 or 3 ponies in play. I guess Westfold Horse-breeder might become a staple in hobbit decks with Spirit.

War Equipment is perfect for Erkenbrand. A defense boost and two extra hit points to cancel a couple more shadow cards before you have to heal him.

 

Tireless Guard is great for Idraen - you quest with her, clear the active location with Lorien Guide or Steed of Imladris, and then after staging you exhaust her to reduce the threat of a pesky location by 2. Before, there wasn’t quite as much of an incentive to clear the active location when she was questing.

 

If Tireless Guard really doesn’t have a limit, then it could prove especially useful on 4-threat (or more) locations that you don’t want to travel to. And it makes any 0- or 1-willpower Scout or Ranger characters slightly better during the questing phase.

 

Tireless Guard is also a soft solution to location lock - assuming you have the allies to support multiple copies of it.

 

I’ve been playing with a proxy of Eldahir, and he’s outstanding, especially in a Dunedain deck.

He isn't a Warrior. Don't think he can receive war equipment.

## 33 [PsychoRocka on May 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2233714)

War Equipment to me is actually a really really good card. This is 100% because it can go on allies as well as heroes. 

They do have to have the warrior trait but I can think of several great targets for this attachment.

First one that comes to mind is the ally version of Gimli. Gimli already has sentinel, 2 defense and 3 hitpoints and whats more he has an inbuilt readying effect so that he can both quest and attack/defend. With War Equipment he becomes a 4 defense, 5 hitpoints defender with sentinel. This is pretty impressive. He would also have 3 attack which would make him insanely flexible and an extremely good all round ally. Quest with him each round, ready him from his effect then he either defends or attacks like a champion at more or less the same level/stats that a hero would. 
It works extremely well on Hama or Gamling turning both into 4 defense 4 hitpoint walls.

Possibly the best receiver is the Gondorian Spearman we have had since the core set. Yes he can only do 1 point of damage while defending rather then the 2 he could do if he had spear of the citadel attached HOWEVER with war equipment he is a 3 defence, 3 hitpoint ally and will actually be able to survive attacks of up to 5 attack strength rather than dying the second an enemy attack has 2 or more attack strength. If this is not extremely useful I don't know what is!

Defender of Rammas becomes a 6 defense, 3 hitpoint defending machine and his number 1 weakness (1 hitpoint) is removed. 

Defender of the Naith becomes a bit more playable/useful. 
Henneth Annun Guard is another great recipient for this attachment and becomes a decent defender this way as well. 

Warden of Helms deep becomes a 5 defense, 4 hitpoint wall with sentinel. 

It is also fantastic on Guardian of Rivendell.
Longbeard Sentry becomes a much better defender.....

Pretty much any ally with the warrior trait that is normally used to defend OR could become a much better defender with +2 def and +2 hitpoints is a fantastic recipient for this attachment. This attachment is amazing for decks that utilise allies as defenders more so than heroes or really any decks that use several of the allies mentioned above. 

Its actually not bad on Tactics Aragorn either as it puts him at 4 attack, 4 defense and 7 hitpoints. Due to his in built ability that reduces enemy armour higher attack is not really as important and War Equipment turns him into a very capable defender while also buffing his attack a little. So long as he is not your main or only offensive hero/option he makes a fantastic emergency defender.

Oh shoot, I never noticed it didn't have a limit! That changes things, because you can use one copy of Tireless Guard and multiple Scouts or Rangers to get a bigger bonus. Still not quite sure it's worth it, but it's certainly more intriguing...

 

@PsychoRocka, I think you added one to the defense bonus of War Equipment; that might make it a little less attractive. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

I'm generally with you though--I think War Equipment is best used on defensive allies. My personal favourite recipient is the Defender of the Naith.

Sorry but there is no ambiguity at all, it is Perfectly clear.

I did not read the description anywhere else, and I don't know french. So, to this moment, it wasn't clear to me. Good that it can be attached to any warrior. That'll make it hella useful.

Defender of the Naith and Watcher of the Bruinen both potentially become usable for multiple defences with +1def and +2hp (The Watcher could also attack for 2 once you're done). Ally Boromir is a great option - at 2def he'll probably still ready most times, the extra hp will let him do so more often, and if he takes damage and readies each time then he can attack for 4 at the end.

My favourite possibility though would be if a Tactics deck were to play it cross-table onto one of my Veterans of Osgiliath in this deck. [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/488/the-ring-of-fire-sails-to-gondor-elite-2.0] Between 40 threat, Boromir, Visionary and Narya on top of the attachment (plus an extra ready from Faramir), they can quest for 3, defend for 4 with 4hp, and attack for 6.

I'm really curious what the exact English wording is going to be on Master Blacksmith. Like I'm going to assume that if you sneak attack him in, his Response won't trigger. Ditto with playing him via Stand and Fight.

 

I feel like if he had the Noldor trait he would be amazing, but as Gondor he is just alright. Makes me wonder if they are ever going to create any craftsman specific events/attachments in the future.

Well I'm french so I can answer that.

 

It reads "when you play Master Blacksmith from your hand", so it won't work with sneak attack, quite similar to Galadriel's ability, but he can be hanging around quite a bit, so I like him a lot.

The card must be attached on the hero which allowed you to pay the 3 required resources of the Master Blacksmith. You cannot attach it to another character.

Oh and I haven't checked if this has been mentionned before but you have to pay the 3 resources from the resource pool of a single hero.

 

So best case is you have a Tactics hero, pay 3 resources from the hero and attach a Citadel Plate for free (from your hand or discard pile).

Oh, it's been 4 days since we got this cards, didn't think it was a spoiler here. Feel free to ask more questions about them.

 

The Leadership Event was considered the most powerfull cards by a lot of person, it allows a very good first turn with Denethor II, and with the Tactics ally, can allow you to play him easily... since Boromir I is Noble. With Boromir I this card is just 2 tactics resource for 1 card and 1 threat :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I think it's good too with Spirit and a Miruvor for untap. Could be good in a Arwen-Elladan-Elrohir deck.

 

The tactics ally is quite good in my opinion since it's a 1/1/1/2 ally (Gondor Crafman by the way) for 3 minus the cost of the weapon/armor, which is quite nice for Gondor swarm, and can choose the weapon/armor from the discard, which is basically a free card draw.

 

The lore attachment is quite crappy in my opinion, it's what power in the earth should have been since the begining, and it's still bad.

 

The spirit event name should be "snack", don't know this "Evenses" word... might be in the book?

Might look bad, but can proc hobbit's pipe, and since you ready them, you can use Merry II, untap him with Fast Hitch, and commit him with Hobbit Pony then use him with Snack :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] or just commit him with Pony and still use Snack if no enemies got revealed. It's still not that powerfull since we lack hobbit characters...

It's "Elevenses". The card was partially spoiled and elevenses is one of the many meals a Hobbit usually eats every day.

Master Smith seems a bit odd,  like... I am wanting to be running Gondor, in Tactics, with lots of weapons and armor,  and also I'm not running Beregond, who makes everything cheaper than the smith could anyway.

Yeah my thoughts exactly. Originally I thought that he could equip himself which would allow synergy with the new war equipment. Banania's translation though suggests otherwise.

Restricting it to the hero that paid for the blacksmith really hurts this card. The hero who paid may not even be a good recipient for the armour/weapons in your hand.

Eagerly awaiting the actual spoiler on this on to clarify.

I just saw this, and was wondering how (relatively) little love there is for Captain's Wisdom. I would think this would be a total power house in the lines of Daeron's Runes. Of course not as versatile but it is easy to find a Noble within Leadership. Denethor seems an obvious candidate.

There are an awful lot of Noble heroes out there. Boromir's ability to ready himself right away helps him, but when it comes to seeing up the early game, Captain's Wisdom can help out anywhere.

The blacksmith guy could be useful if you're playing in campaign and happen to discard Sting, Glamdring, or Anduril (happens to me all the time).  

 

I like Elevenses, it's a surprisingly limited card but it will actually fit well into a Hobbit deck I had been messing around with recently.  That deck has Frodo and Fatty.  You don't really want either of them questing, unless you have no enemies on the board (so, Hobbit Ponies...), and this card would let me quest and then remove them both at the benefit of triggering Hobbit Pipes.  There are surprisingly few cards that work well with Hobbit Pipes: Elrond's Counsel is great but only if you have a Noldor hero (using a Noldor ally makes this a dead card for a while, some of the time), Smoke Rings, Keen as Lances, and Galadhrim's Greeting are expensive, and Free to Choose only works off the encounter deck so you can't time it well with getting all your Pipes attached.  Elevenses will have a home in one or two of my decks.

But in the decks I build with Tactics Boromir, I usually am not shy of Tactics resources. The Leadership resources in a mono-Leadership deck could prove more useful for a turbo opening with Denethor (and 7 resources), potentially playing a 4 and 3 cost allies for a very hopeful A Very Good Tale. And Leadership Denethor seldom plays vital role with his questing or combat actions.

Am I wrong in thinking that Sam ends up being a pretty dud character.  Sure, you can play him for 1 if you have Frodo, so 2 WP for 1 cost is great.  Standing him for +1 stats doesn't seem like it really offers that much.  most enemies would destroy a 2 HP, 2 defense character.  And attacking for 2 isn't much - though I guess it is something.  Very situation.  Only used if you have Frodo.

 

Raiment of War - counts as 2 restricted?!  For it's cost, those stats a good. But that double restriction means I'll likely never play it.

 

Master Ironsmith - can be neat to get Plate on for free.  But again, very situational. 

 

Guarded Ceaselessly - meh.  Rather just include things that get rid of locations than some repeatable threat reduction.

 

Elevenses - meh. 

 

 

 

So that leaves Captain's Wisdom, Eldahir, Lanwyn and Mirkwood Explorer.   4 cards, 1 of which is a hero.   But I really like those cards, especially the Explorer.

Not a huge fan of the pack either, but it's a totally fine multiplayer pack. 2nd in the cycle packs normally are a bit more lackluster to me (not a huge fan of Rossiel either), at least for solo. So, Captain's Wisdom is good in multiplayer, but not so much in solo unless you're using lots of action advantage or Boromir. Sam is interesitng. He was clearly designed as a mini version of the hero to work with Spirit Frodo so he readies after he defends, but as said earlier, his defense will most of the times go unused, and his willpower is useless after Frodo defends (though it combos excellently with Boromir), and his attack is not much. BUT, if you're running a deck with Frodo, such as Frodo-Glorfindel-Loragorn, 2 willpower, 2 attack with readying for 1 is really good. Eldahir will go straight in my Leadership-Lore Dúnedain deck without question. He's easily my favorite card of the pack.

Rossiel is really cool, but I find that I'll still use the Victory stuff and just include different heroes - in multiplayer setting - so I can enable Keen as Lances for everyone.

Well I probably won't use it for a Hero. But as it can be attached to a character it would be quite good on Defender of Rammas for example. 5 defence, 3 hitpoints is nice.

Ah I didn't notice it could be attached to characters.  After looking at the various Warrior allies, I like that attachment a lot more.  Plenty of solid targets for that attachment.  Though I don't often include attachments aimed at getting put on allies.

Forgot to mention, Raiment might replace Shield for Amarthiul in my Leadership Lore Dunedain deck. Since I already use Warnings to buff his defense and by the time I get set up the Guardians of Arnor do most of the defense, the extra hit points and attack bonus might come in handy, especially since I can use Descendants of Kings to ready a defending Amarthiul and then use him to attack for 4.

Dain is pronounced as "dane". Otherwise, it does hurt my ears too, sometimes.

Pretty sure it's "dine". The "ay" sound of the letter A in English is excluded from Tolkien languages, and instead it's the "ah" sound it has in most languages.

Same thing with Balin. If Dain was "Day-in" or "Dane", Balin would be "Bay-lin". But since it's "Bah-lin", we know it's also "Dah-in". Again, the "ay" sound of letter A is absent from Tolkien (or at least from Old Norse from which the dwarven names were taken).

And the name meant "Staff-elf". Weird name for a Dwarf!

Dain is Day-in because of "ai" together.

Balin is Bah-in because there is the "l" in between the "a" and "i".  

 

 

At least that is my take on it.

That's precisely what I was arguing. You say the vowels in Balin and Dáin are not comparable, but I'm saying they are. The fact that people pronounce "ai" differently from "ali" is precisely because they transport the English pronunciation of the diphthong "ai" to Tolkien (in this case Dwarvish) language, which is an incorrect assumption. We should not assume that the diphthong is pronounced in the English way for other languages. As far as I know, Dwarvish vowels (in this case A) don't have so many different sounds as they do in English (as in "cat" and "day"), but just one: "ah" (as in Balin or "rat"). In pretty much any other language (thinking of Greek, Italian and Spanish), the sounds of the vowels in Dain and Balin are both the same.

 

To put it simply, the fact that you say that "ai" and "ali" are pronounced differently is because you're thinking in English. In most European languages, the "l" in between is irrelevant to the sound of the vowels. 

 

Of course, I am ommitting the accent on the a, which does mess up the pronunciation. Master of Lore's article pretty much seals the deal, I was just saying people give Tolkien languages the rules of English, which they should not do.

 

I'll still be saying Dine though.

From that article: 

The only certainly wrong answer is the one used by the Dwarves in Peter Jackson’s Hobbit film adaption.  Dáin is not “Dane” as this ignores both Tolkien’s direction on diphthongs [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong] and acute accents [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent], both of which apply to Mr. Ironfoot.  Apologies to an HBO stand-up comedian, you do not share a first name with the King Under the Mountain.

> Pretty sure it's "dine". The "ay" sound of the letter A in English is excluded from Tolkien languages, and instead it's the "ah" sound it has in most languages.
> 
> Same thing with Balin. If Dain was "Day-in" or "Dane", Balin would be "Bay-lin". But since it's "Bah-lin", we know it's also "Dah-in". Again, the "ay" sound of letter A is absent from Tolkien (or at least from Old Norse from which the dwarven names were taken).

Well, I have to say (a bit shamefully) I go by the movies where it is pronounced in a way similar to "dane". Just as Thrain is "thrane". It is probably easy to look it up somewhere but I was assuming since they had all the linguists, they would not pronounce it wrong in the films… the guys behind those things looked very knowledgeable judging by the appendices in the LotR.

I'm glad we spent a page of comments on the pronunciation of Dain. The digression is real, folks. :-)

Anyway, I really wish I had time to treat all these new cards. I need to prove to myself that some of them are duds before I believe it. :-P

Back to the cards for a moment.  With the way Master Ironsmith is worded, can he attach Weapon or Armor to a hero who isn't typically eligible for it?  Is his ability getting around play restrictions?   I think not, since it doesn't say put into play like Vilya does, but figured I'd for other opinions.

I don't think you can get around the restrictions on the card. They are static effects that specify restrictions on how it is attached rather than an ability to trigger when playing it. That's how I see it.

If, hypothetically, there were any weapons or armour that had limitations like Lembas or Ent Draught ("You can only play X if [condition]") then you could bypass those since you're not actually playing the attachment.

But no, you couldn't get round the "Attach to a [trait] hero" kind of restrictions.

Yeah, the ones of the latter half of the Ring-maker cycle are still not up.

 

I wonder what enocunter set icon will I use in my dividers, the wheel or the shell?

 

Also, it's really weird that the eye enemy doesn't deal damage at all when killing it. I mean, we just destroyed its eye and it doesn't affect it at all?

My "thematic explanation" would be that we hurt the eye and it went back underwater, so the thing in the depth stops attacking us directly.

I can't help but wonder what was the decision behind that. Doesn't it essentially robs people who will purchase Thing in the Depths but won't purchase Flight of the Stormcaller of 1 neutral card?

It's probably because they needed to fit more things into the encounter deck for Thing in Depths rather than anything actually sinister.

I suppose it depends on how you play, be we handled it pretty well in our 4 player group.  We had a Cidan, Arwen, Erestor deck and a Gandalf, Glorfindel, Eleanor deck that handled questing.  .Gandalf and Glorfindel helped out with combat after the tentacles showed up.  Combat was handled by my Dori, Mablung and Treebeard deck paired with a Beregond, Hama, Bard (elf-friend) deck.  There were several turns if we didn't clear the location we'd lose, but managed to keep pushing through.  Eleanor didn't do anything until the 3rd stage when the treacheries finally became a problem, which helped immensely.   It did seem we were on the brink of losing just as closely as we were on the brink of winning for the last half of the quest.   I thoroughly enjoyed that.

I am playing solo. Cirdan, Galdor, Galadriel with Gildor and Glorfindel allies being my tanks.

My problem was stage one and the corsair there who is in the staging area in the beggining. Changed my deck a bit and made it ok :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

No doubt already mentioned by someone, but with Heir of Mardil, the Captain's Wisdom becomes 2 resources without the loss of action (albeit with 1 resource spent earlier on Heir of Mardil). Not too bad.

With a Boromir variant, yes. Just stall on Stage 1 without travelling to the Helm for 10+ rounds, or however long it takes you to get Boromir fully set up with a ton of resources. Then travel to the helm, defend the Corsairs with Boromir+Blood of Numenor. Next round burn through the Helm and the quest with a couple Lay of Nimrodels. The Corsairs will join your team and you will have a fully set up Boromir to deal with the tentacles.

 

I do like the punishment for stalling that the developers built into the quest, but I think a deck that can muster a ton of willpower can twist it to its advantage.

What Boromir variants have you found to be good for solo, Seastan? It's been a while since I used him and I'm not particularly interested in the classic deck with Glorfindel and Galadriel.

I was actually thinking about a Beorn deck (he could take one of the corsairs on the first or second turn, I guess) with maybe Arwen and Denethor (or a Lore hero).

 

I love Beorn hero in solo decks.
