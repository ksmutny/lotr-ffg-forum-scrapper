Hey all,

 

It's been quite a while since I have played this great game - I've been very busy.  However, I am looking to jump back in and try out some new decks.  I believe the last deck I played with was Flight to the Ford deck about a year ago (haha cant remember if it was Richsabre or Glaurung who made that good ol' deck) and I was looking to try something new.  What decks are some of your favorites and are fun to play?  I own everything up to Voice of Isengard.  

 

Any suggestions appreciated!

 

Khamul

Glad you are back !!

 

Try http://ringsdb.com [http://ringsdb.com], lots of players upload their decks there and you can get lots of ideas.

 

Wish I could help but I have all the packs and with all these cards in between I cannot help with what is where. I play Noldor or Dunedain all the time for the past months but you do not have the cards for them so ...   :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

On ringsdb.com.I believe you can tell it what packs you have to work with. Also, the deck lists have a "require cards up to x pack.". That should help you find decks that'll work with your card pool. Oh, and welcome back!!

Yeah, this is probably the best tool out there for Khamul to find some decks.  It makes finding a deck you have all the cards for very easy.
