While the new FAQ is a big step in the right direction, there still seems to be some inconsistencies and errors in the new FAQ. I hope this thread can be used to list any problem areas and clarify what the intent of some of the not so obvious entries are trying to say.

Case 1

(1.22) "When Revealed" Effects
Example: If the players use the Stage 3b "Don't Leave the Path!" (CORE 121) quest card effect to search for a Forest Spider and put it into play, the "When Revealed" effect on the Forest Spider will not trigger, since the effect on "Don't Leave the Path!" does not spcifically use a form of the word "reveal". 

Forest Spider (Core 96) does not contain a "When Revealed" card effect. I assume that instead of a Forest Spider, the example should have used King Spider (Core 74) instead. Oh yes, and a typo "specifically" not "spcifically"

Case 2

(1.17) Unclaimed Objectives
An unclaimed objective is one that is not currently claimed and under the control of a player.

This would be much easier to understand if it said "An unclaimed objective is one that is not under the control of a player." At the moment it is confusing since it seems to imply "An unclaimed objective is one that is (not currently claimed) and (under the control of a player)"  instead of "An unclaimed objective is one that is not (currently claimed and under the control of a player)."

When I get time I shall check to see if there are further issues or obscurities. I hope others can add problems they see with the new FAQ.

Yes, 've just read that. So when it doesn't say REVEAL the "when revealed" effect doesn't apply. During the setup of the Escape it says attach encounter cards, according the new FAQ then, the "when revealed" effects don't apply?

And howabout the Quick Strike?

Otherwise, a much better FAQ I'd say!

ps: I like how they reversed CU, I'd rather have him less tough whilst having Wargs tougher.

 The "multiple attacks per turn" section could use more examples as it is still confusing.  As I understand it, the same player can't attack the same enemy (whether or not they are engaged with them) twice during the regular attack phase, but with Quick Strike I theoretically can since that isn't part of the regular attack phase.

Someone else in a previous post explained the multiple attack thing.  Make note of the difference between Character and Player.

A Player can only attack each enemy once per turn but a Character can attack multiple times if he can be readied again.

That's right, except you could also attack that enemy again if the character you used was somehow refreshed and you got to join in an attack when someone else was the active player.

 

So I think if Legolas had unexpected courage on him, when you were the active player you could declare an attack by Legolas against an enemy engaged with another player (by using his ranged keyword).

You could then use UC to refresh Legolas.

Then when the other player (who is now the active player) declared an attack against the same enemy (with which he is engaged), Legolas could join in that attack too, because you are not the active player, no have you declared the attack, just participated in it.
