Is it me, or is there just no reason not to include at least 1 copy of Banner of Elendil in your deck when playing FOTW quests or even ToS quests? In FOTW if triggers Aragorn's ability, and the bonuses you get make a huge difference. Especially with decks that would otherwise not use Aragorn's resource (except maybe to pay for Gandalf), but even in a Gandalf deck I was playing with lots of neutral cards he can pay for, it's still very much worth it to include that single Banner of Elendil. What do you think?

It's a crazy good card is what I think.

Yeah it's auto include in the FOTW quests for me. Haven't gone back and played ToS but may include it when playing those as well in the future. Ridiculously good card.

There is a minor issue with that card: it should read "attach to Halbarad".

And read Aragorn instead of "attached hero".
