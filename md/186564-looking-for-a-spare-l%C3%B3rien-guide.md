# [Looking for a spare Lórien Guide.](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186564-looking-for-a-spare-l%C3%B3rien-guide/)

Just wondering if anyone might have a spare Lórien Guide, since it's a x3 card in the core set, so if anyone bought multiple core sets, they are all extras.

 

Somehow between all the moves I've had to do in the last two years, I seem to have lost one of my copies. I know it's not really a card I'm really going to need 3 copies of in a deck, but it rubs me the wrong way to be missing it, especially since I've recently been able to get the other x1 and x2 core set cards on eBay. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Anyway, if you've got a spare and you wouldn't mind sending it my way, please either reply here or shoot me a message, and we can sort out the details of compensation and shipping. Thanks!

To narrow it down a little, which continent would this be sent to?

Japan, according to his profile.

 

I have two core sets and would probably be willing to spare a Lórien guide, but it would have to be sent from northern Europe and I'm not sure what the delivery would cost and whether it would really be worth it. Personally, if I do use that card nowadays it's in very specialised decks and rarely more than two copies of it.

I guess that would be a helpful bit of information.

 

As Olorin93 stated, I am currently in Japan. However, I am US military, so I also have a US address it could be sent to.

You could also try contacting FFG's customer service. They may be willing to get you a replacement.

I'll second the idea of contacting FFG's customer sevice. I mis-placed/lost a Bilbo Baggins card from the first Hobbit box not long after I purchased it. I called FFG CS to see if they could send me a replacement card and they were happy to do so. Card showed up in my mail a few days later.

FFG's customer service is amazing.

Thanks for the suggestions, I'll try getting in touch with FFG.

I have a spare from my 2nd core set.  Give FFG a try first, but if that doesn't work send me a message and I'll drop it in the mail.
