After player's card pool become bigger and bigger, sometimes we can't imagine how hard it was to beat the first cycle with that limited card pool, so maybe a little puzzle can bring us back.

In this puzzle you can use a "magic" deck whick means you can draw any card you want when you draw, and you can choose which card will be revealed each turn!

You can only use player cards belongs to the CORE, The Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at Carrock.

Try to beat Conflict at Carrock in solo mode and make your final score below 77!

My solution:

 

Heroes: Eowyn, Legolas, Theodred (this is the order I will write down their resources)

 

Set-up:

Staging area: The Carrock (2 threat/6 progress)

Starting Hand: Steward of Gondor, Song of Kings (x2), Unexpected Courage, Sneak attack (x2)

Threat 26

 

1st Round

Draw: Beorn/Ressources: E1/L1/T1

Planning: Eowyn’s ressource for Song of Kings on Legolas, play Steward of Gondor on Legolas and use it.

Questing: Send everyone and place Theodred’s ressource on Eowyn; reveal: Roasted slowly (this card is always shuffled back into the encounter deck), make 4 progress (3 left)

Threat 27

 

2nd Round

Draw: Ever vigilant/Ressources (always including Steward of Gondor): 2/5/1

Planning: Unexpected Courage on Legolas and Song of Kings on Eowyn (with Theodred’s ressource)

Questing: Eowyn and Theodred (ressource on Eowyn) and reveal bee pastures (1 threat/2 progress), make 2 progress (1 left)

Travel: Get Grimbeorn into the staging area by travelling to bee pastures

Threat 28

 

3rd Round

Draw: Ever vigilant Ressources: 2/8/1

Planning: Pay (everyone has a leadership icon) for Grimbeorn (leave 3 ressources on Legolas)

Questing: Send Eowyn and Theodred (resource on Eowyn) and reveal roasted slowly. STAGE FINISHED Louis, Rupert, Stuart and Morris get added to the staging area (34 engagement cost/2threat/4attack/2defense/10hp each)

Travel: The Carrock becomes the active location (granting +1 defense and attack to each troll enemie)!

Combat (shadow cards will always have no effect; there are enough cards without one to make that happen): Engage Louis. Grimbeorn defends (7/10 hp). Sneak attack beorn into play, trigger his action and kill Louis (Legolas+beorn+grimbeorn=3+8+4=15 against 14 needed). Beorn back into hand.

Threat: 32 (through Louis’s effect)

 

4th Round

Draw: Gondorian Spearman Ressources: 2/6/1

Planning: Play Gondorian Spearman

Questing: Send Eowyn and reveal roasted slowly. Threat goes up by 2 to 34

Combat: Engage all trolls. Defend Rupert with the spearman (dies, but deals 1 damage). Grimbeorn defends the other 2 (1/10hp). Sneak attack Beorn and tigger his action again. Kill Stuart (Legolas, Grimbeorn, Beorn) removing the + 1 defense buff. Ready Legolas (UC) and Beorn (ever vigilant) attack Morris with Legolas, Beorn and Theodred for 13 and kill him. Ever vigilant again to attack Rupert with Beorn (4/10hp). Beorn back into hand.

Threat: 35

 

5th Round

Draw: Quick strike Ressources: 1/7/1

Planning: Play Beorn and Quickstrike to kill Rupert.

Questing: Send everyone for 8 and reveal roasted slowly. VICTORY!

Score: 4 Rounds + 0 damaged/dead heroes + 35 threat = 75

 

Hopefully there is no mistake.

Congratulations!

So let us make it harder~

Try to get 67 or less!

My Solution:

 

Heroes: Eowyn, Gimli, Gloin

 

Set-UP:

Staging area: The Carrock (2 threat/6 progress)

Starting hand: Steward of Gondor, Unexpected Courage, Song of Kings, Sneak Attack (x2), Beorn

Threat: 29

 

1st Round

Draw: Stand together/ressources: 1/1/1

Planning: Play Song of Kings on Eowyn with Gimli’s ressource, play Steward of Gondor on Eowyn, activate it and play Unexpected Courage on Gimli.

Questing: Everyone and reveal Oak-wood Grove and make 4 progress

Travel: Oak-wood Grove

Threat: 30

 

2nd round

Draw: Ever Vigilant/ressources: 3/1/1

Planning: Nothing.

Questing: Eowyn and Gloin, reveal Grimbeorn, use action window to pay Gimli’s ressource on Grimbeorn (1/8), make 4 progress STAGE FINISHED!

Travel: The Carrock is active!

Combat (again shadow cards will have no effects): Engage Louis, defend with Gimli (1/5hp), sneak attack Beorn, trigger his ability and kill Louis with Gimli (14 damage out of 14 needed)

Threat:34 (Louis’s effect)

 

3rd Round

Draw: Blade Mastery/ressources: 6/1/1

Planning: Buy Grimbeorn

Questing: Eowyn and reveal Roasted Slowly, threat up by 2 (36)

Combat: Engage all trolls. Use Stand together. Defend one troll with Grimbeorn and Gloin place 2 damage on Gloin (+ 2 ressources), defend the rest with Grimbeorn alone (4/10hp). Sneak attack Beorn, trigger his effect, play Blade Mastery on Beorn (now 9 attack), attack Stuart with Gimli and Beorn for 15 (killing him; +1 defense buff gone), ready both (Ever vigilant/Unexpected Courage) and kill Morris with Grimmbeorn and Beorn (13 damage out of 13 needed; +1 attack buff gone), attack Rupert with Gimli (leaving the troll at 7 hp).

Threat: 37



4th round

Draw: Galadhrim’s Greeting/ressources: 3/2/1

Planning: Galadhrim’s Greeting (-6 threat/31)

Questing: Send all heroes, ready Gimli, reveal Rosted Slowly and make 8 progress (clearing the Carrock and placing 2 out of 1 needed progress on the quest).

Combat: Defend Rupert (7/10hp) with Grimbeorn (2/10hp), kill Rupert with him and Gimli (10 damage out of 10 needed), VICTORY!

Score: 3 rounds + 6 damage on heroes + 0 dead heroes + 31 threat = 67

 

This was a much harder puzzle than the first one, took me about an hour. Hopefully there is no mistake (many things, e.g. the damage on most trolls and the score, just fit perfectly so messing up by one point somewhere could ruin it all).

Excelent solution!

Have you consider to use cards like Gladden Fields to get some VPs to reduce score?

Here is my solution(still can't get less than 67 :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] )

Heroes:Glorfindel Theodred Eowyn

Start hands:Song of king, steward of Gondor , sneak ,sneak,sneak,Gandolf

T1:

get any card and use Eowyn's resource to get SoK to Glorfindel.Use Glorfindel and Theodred's 2 resources to get SoG to Glorfindel,now G2 T0 E0.

Send all to quest and Theodred give resource to Eowyn,revealed Grimbeorn.use Eowyn's ability to discard the new card.9:2 and finished stage 1B,carrock became active location and put 4 trolls to the staging area.

Threat:30

T2:

Get For gondor! now G5 T1 E2,sneak Gandolf in quest phase to give Louis 4 damages, send all to the quest.Theodred give resource to Glorfinder .revealed Roasted Slowly. T8:W12,get 4 progress tokens on Carrock.

Threat:31

T3:

Get UC ,now G9 T1 E3,use Glorfindel's 8 resources to Grimbeorn,use Eowyn's 2 resources to get UC to Glorfindel, sneak Gandolf in quest phase to give  Stuart 4 damages ,send all but Grimbeorn and Theodred to quest,revealed Sacked on Eowyn,T8:W11,finished Carrock and get 1 progress on 2B. Engage Louis(6/10) and Grimbeorn defends , Grimbeorn get 1 damage and Threat raise to 34,use UC to ready Glorfindel and G+T+G=8ATK to kill Louis, remove Sacked.

Threat:35

T4:

Get any card,now G4 T1 E2,Eowyn and Theodred quest and get 1 resource on Theodred, revealed Roasted Slowly,T6:W5, discard the new card, 3 trolls all engaged,defend with Grimbeorn,use Glorfinder and Theodred's resources to play sneak gandolf and For Gondor! Gandolf give Morris 4 damage, Glorfindel4ATK+Grimbeorn5ATK=8ATK to give Stuart(3DEF,6/10) 6 damages and kill it, UC to ready Glorfindel and attack Morris(2DEF,6/10) with Gandolf5ATK to make 7 damages and kill it .

Threat:36

T5:

Get The Galadrim's Greeting ,now G4 T1 E3, play The Galadrim's Greeting and Gandolf to reduce 6 Threats and draw 3 cards and one of them is Strider's Path ,send Glorfindel and Theodred to quest and giveGlorfindel 1 resource,revealed Gladden Fields and use Glorfindel's resource to play Strider's Path and make Gladden Fields become active location, T0:W4,and finished Gladden Fields(3VP),Grimboern defend Rupert and UC ready Glorfindel, Then Glorfindel+Gandolf+Eowyn+Grimboern=3+4+1+4=12ATK to kill Rupert(2DEF 10/10)

Threat:30

So the final score=4*10+30-3=67

I wasn't sure if more than one core set was allowed^^

 

Nice solution on your part, too.

I found a mistake on my part: The buffs from the trolls are only active when they are engaged, what would make Gimli take 1 less damage. Luckily there is a shadow effect on Wargs that increases the attack of the enemie by one so nothing changes :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Why do you draw with Gandalf in turn 5? If you reduce your threat by 5 instead of exploring the gladden fields you improve your score by 2. Also, in turn 3 you can Keep your Card and take the quest loss by one. If this Card is striders pass you still have it for the last round, allowing the gladden fields clear resulting in another improvment of the score by 2 Points (should be 63). Or do I overlook something?
