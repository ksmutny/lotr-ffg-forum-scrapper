It’s neat that the old encounter sets are being reused. Maybe it’ll tie into the new deck building format at Gen Con.

I'm going to have to blow the dust off those encounter sets, lol. Probably wouldn't hurt to revisit them in preparation...

I like that it is said you can take cycle only player cards and do the quests.  Encouraging

So we can expect either easy quests or powerful player cards.

This may have been discussed already. The Dale allies are themed to get a bonus whilst they have an xxx attachment - do you read that as per attachment? Obviously restricted attachments would limit that to +2 for say, Warrior of Dale, but for North Realm Lookout, items are less likely to be restricted...

Definitely not per attachment.

Yes, it is if, not for each.

So they will include Dale only allies in the box. And it will make the Dale great even sooner than expected. The spirit ally is just awesome and the Leadership will probably be similar to the Tactics, reducing the cost of an Armour (instead of weapon) and boosting defense and giving sentinel if he has some Armour attached. Strong.
