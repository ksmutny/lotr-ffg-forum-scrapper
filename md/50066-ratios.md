When building decks, what sort of ratios do people find the best - firstly in terms of allies/eve/nts attachments, and secondly in terms of primary/secondary sphere if you play a mixed deck.

I've been experimenting with a mixed Leadership/tactics deck, and even though I feel like I've included plenty of allies, none of them ever seem to appear - just lost a game where Theorded has 21 resources in his pool (he was the steward of Gondor) because nothing useful came out for him to play with them.

I've also found, that in games where Steward of Gondor doesn't come out very early, the secondary sphere is always very short of resources at teh start, but has them to burn at the end. Any thoughts on how best to avoid this?

As many card games, there are no real precise card type ratio to follow to get a "good deck". It all depends on so many different things (number of players, the sphere, the whole strategy of the deck,...) that giving an answer would be always strictly limited to one particular situation.

To give some examples, a Lore/Energy deck, for a multiplayer game can very well have as few as 12 allies as opposed to a Leadership/Energy deck for solo games that will definitely need at least 25.

The problem is similar with the sphere ratio within a deck. With 3 Steward of Gondor in a Leadership/XXX deck, you can play a ton of the least represented color and still play those cards easily, while another deck will have a hard time doing that.

As for your unspent resources, I guess playing 3 Gandalf per deck (if you don't do it already), is necessary, so all those unused resources can be spent on a costy usefull card. You may be lacking of card draw as well (Gandalf is there again!), but try to work in team with a Lore deck that can make you draw a ton with Beravor (generally helped by Unexpected Courage).

I've generally only constructed dual sphere decks.

I usually take all the cards from the major sphere = 29 + 18 cards from the minor sphere + 3 Gandalf = 50 cards.

When selecting the minor sphere cards, I think long and hard about the higher cost cards. Generally I only select mostly 1 or 2 cost cards with some 3 cost cards, but occasionally I'll use a 4 cost card like Norther Tracker because he is so fantastic.

The dual sphere decks work better when you have a way of generating resources for your minor sphere, like Gloin, Theodred, and/or Steward of Gondor.

IMO Leadership/Spirit is an almost unbeatable combo for solo play in Passage to Mirkwood and Journey Down the Anduin.

I use Eowyn, Theodred, and Dunhere. Low Threat, lots of resources.

Currently, I run three decks: (Major-Minor, Ally/Attachment/Event)

1) Leadership-Spirit, 15/15/21

2) Spirit-Tactics, 18/9/24

3) Lore-Leadership, 24/12/15

Together: 3 Leadership Heroes, 3 Spirit Heroes, 2 Lore Heroes, 1 Tactics Hero, 57 Allies, 36 Attachments, 60 Events

With your spirit-tactics deck I would have expected a much higher count of attachments. between UC and FotL for Spirit and Blade/Axe/Plate/Horn for Tactics, I think that'd have been the highest count of attachments.

Hello, I do indeed use both Unexpected Courage and the Favour of the Lady from the Spirit sphere but I only include Blade of Gondolin from the Tactics. Citadel Plate is definitely too expensive for a Tactics-minor deck and I've never actually needed it (that badly). The Tactics Hero is Legolas and thus Dwarven Axe also means a little to me, especially if there is Dunedain Mark at hand (of the coop player). Horn of Gondor I have considered, and I still do. It may be a good inclusion but I don't know what I'd exclude.
