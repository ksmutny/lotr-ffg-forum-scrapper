The heading says it all. If anyone is at GenCon and has any news about LOTR:LCG, please please please post it. Of particular interest is whether or not there will be a return to adventure packs any time soon. Thanks in advance!

They're all having too much fun without us to bother checking in. We'll here all about it on monday.

I saw (in another thread) we have a title for The Hobbit saga (part 2): ("On the Doorstep").

You know what I just thought about? With the second Hobbit expansion we're coming up to our first real BATTLE in the card game with the Battle of Five armies! Any speculation about how they might handle this?
