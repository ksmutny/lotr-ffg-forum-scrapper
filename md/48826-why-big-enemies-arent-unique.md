 It is quite impossible to win if a second Hill Troll comes out in the first 1-2 rounds.

As it is quite impossible to defeat twice the Nazgul, if you can't managed the reshuffling of the Encounter deck.

So, why didn't the rules add the Unique keywords on these? It would mean that you have the same chances to find the Hill troll (2 copies) but if one is already in, you discard the second and draw a second encounter.

what do you think?

Dont worry my friend. Trolls and Nazgul is not so big problem. Play more and you will fix it.

There are 9 Nazgul, who knows how many Hill Trolls. It's definitely a pain, but there's no story-based reason for them to be unique.

It'll be interesting to see whether they later bring in unique enemies- presumably, they'd have to be strategically deployed like the Nazgul, or else the likelihood of them cropping up would be too low to warrant inclusion.

Only one of the current crop I could see Unique is Ufthak.

I don't see any reason that the Hill Troll should be unique.  I wasn't able to really excel at beating Journey Down the Anduin until I realized that I needed to start off with lower threat than I originally wanted to (i.e., swapping Aragorn out for Theodred).  This way, even starting at threat 27, in two player games I have always had plenty of time to prepare for engaging the troll (drawing feints, forest snares, allies, etc).  Plus, it seems like I almost always draw the second Hill Troll during the first quest phase, and I really haven't had that many problems.  It really comes down to planning ahead and allowing yourself adequate time to more than likely draw the carefully planned cards you will need (and The Ghaladrim's Greeting, etc are great for buying yourself extra time).

Maybe this is just me, but by the time I am able to actually engage the Nazgul of Dol Guldur, I normally have enough attack strength to take him down in one or maybe two rounds (with the sacrifice of some ally or two to block), and/or have feint ready and waiting to prevent an initial attack.  Compared to the Hill Troll, the Nazgul feels like you have much more time to prepare in my opinion.

 I think they don't have "unique" encounter cards because they can control how many copies of each card go into an encounter set.  If they don't want to allow two of the same encounter card in play at one time they will have just one copy in a set.  The encounter deck reshuffles, so defeating a unique enemy doesn't stop you from seeing them again.

I think this is spot on.  Plus, if they do want to limit the number of times you face a certain card, they have the option of putting a victory point value onto it.  This allows a lot of flexibility, and fits thematically very well, too (i.e., while there is only one Nazgul at Dol Guldur, the Heroes certainly don't have the means of destroying him permanently, so he has no victory point value and can be faced multiple times, etc).

It seems to have been covered above. Both the number in the encounter deck and the victory points control the frequency of enemies.

How do victory points control the frequency of enemies exactly?

Encounter cards with victory points get set aside when defeated, so they don't get shuffled back into the encounter deck.

I Think two hill trolls can exist, but no more than one Nazghul please!Because I Agree there's 9, but only one from Dul Guldor!

I think they didn't give any victory point on him because everyone must face him sooner or later, but they at least should give him Victory 0 so he doesn't come back!

IMO it doesn't matter how difficult can be to slain a enemy, you just shouldnt face twice the same unique!

 The problem with the Nazgul is that they keep coming back. As long as the Ring still exists they cannot be permanently killed. And note that the rules don´t use the word "killed". Enemies and characters are "defeated".

Exactly. Gandalf, Faramir etc. can all come back into play even after being defeated. So defeated does not equal kill. And the Nazgul cannot be killed, Witch King aside.

Ok, then I think the card works properly!

And on  that note, anyone think we might see cards to bring back defeated heroes to play?

Cards like Fortune or Fate? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 That´s true! How embarrassing! For some reason I remembered it as somehow just saving you from death, not bringing you back. It can even bring back another player´s hero.
