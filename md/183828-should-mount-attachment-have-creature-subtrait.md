Mounts are horses which are animals/creatures.  It's strange that the treachery card "A Frightened Beast" (CoC) can be cancelled if you discard a creature Ally card (in fact the artwork is that of a frightened horse/mount) but you can't discard a Mount attachment (because in game terms it's not a 'creature').

 

I know that the  Creature subtrait is usually associated with ally cards and the Mount trait with attachments.  But I don't see any potential conflict if the two traits are mixed.  Radagast's (SoM 59) ability could be used to pay for the Mount cost if it is added with a Creature subtrait.  You can cancel A Frightened Beast by discarding a Mount-Creature attachment.

 

What do you think?

Many of us have thought the same thing and have been disappointed that the creature trait isn't on mounts. I honestly don't see a reason why they shouldn't be.
