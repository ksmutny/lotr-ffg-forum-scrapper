When your characters commit to a hide test, do they exhaust, and stay exhausted? Or do they ready after the hide test is resolved?

There is nothing special in the rules regarding exhausting a character to commit to a hide test. Therefore readying them should follow normal mechanics (in other words, during the refresh phase or via card effect).
