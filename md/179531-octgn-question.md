This is what I would like to do in octgn, I just want to know if it is possible and if so how?

 

I want to be able to create a player deck and then be able to load the encounter deck so I do not have to always rebuild a player deck when I take on a different scenario. Thanks!

Sure, it is possible. In fact, it is very normal in octgn.

I'm not sure what you are doing.  You should use the deck editor to make and save a deck.  Then when you start a game you load the encounter deck and then load your player deck.  You can use the same deck for every scenario.

The player deck you build is a file, you can get it forever in any folder. And load it the times you want.
