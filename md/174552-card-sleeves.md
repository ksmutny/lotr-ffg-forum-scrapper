Hey guys

 

I would like your opinions about card sleeves.

 

What card sleeves do u think that are best for this game?

 

I use FFG sleeves, they are very good! But I would like to use a sleeve that fits perfectly in the cards, just like the ones Glaurung uses on his videos. 

 

If someone could tell me some sleeves like these I would appreciate!

 

thank you

Ultra Pro Deck Protector sleeves fit very snug.  There's a big difference between those and the FFG sleeves.

If I'm not wrong, Glaurung uses Dragon Shield sleeves. I have played with them and they are indeed very good sleeves however, it is the expensive cost of them that is pretty much the only downside. Dragon Shield are probably the best out there,and do fit the cards very nicely; just keep in mind that if you plan on sleeving your whole collection with them, its going to add up!

Thank you for the aswer jimby and Khamul! I asked glarung he said he bought his for a very cheap price "15usd for 2000p" but couldnt tell the name of the sleeve. Maybe he doesnt uses dragon shield.

 

I was thinking about mayday cause ive heard that they fit just as i want, but i cant find images of this on google

I use dragonshield for my decks and penny sleeves for encounter cards.

 

I use card binders to store player cards.

These are really good for double sleeving. The perfect fits are exactly the size of LOTR cards, and they're made to fit with the hyper mattes. Probably not the best for sleeving an entire collection though.

I have Mayday premium and they are pretty snug.  Not quite as snug as the Ultra Pros, but still pretty good.  However, I have noticed that there are some inconsistencies with the sleeve width.  When I have a stack of cards, some of them stick out a little bit more than others.  It may just be that I got a couple bad packs, but be prepared for some rejects if you go Mayday.

 

You can get Ultra Pros for less than 5 cents per sleeve here: http://www.cheapmagicsleeves.com/bulk-ultra-pro-clear-sleeves-600ct/ [http://www.cheapmagicsleeves.com/bulk-ultra-pro-clear-sleeves-600ct/]

Mayday premiums are pretty hard to find right now and will probably cost you about 5 cents per sleeve.

If you are interested in Dragon Shield, you can buy them in bulk from Potomac Distribution for $6-$7 a box. Most places sell for $10.

Thank you again for the suggestions! I have to import all these sleeves, so for me they would cost 3 x times the price. Im not really looking for great quality, for me the perfect size of the sleeve is more important.

For my decks I use KMC Sleeves. As a MTG player as well I find the KMC's to be my favorite. They are not as good as Dragonshield. If you were to give Dragon Shield a 10/10 I would give KMC's a 8.5-9/10 yet they are much cheaper. They also comes in packs of 80 which work well for one deck and a sideboard. If you time it right you can find sales on Coolstuffinc.com where not so desirable colors (off blue, dark brown, etc) are on sale (that's what I did).

 

KMC sleeves on Amazon [http://www.amazon.com/Hyper-Matte-Sleeves-80-Pack-Black/dp/B00CJ7415M/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1430413133&sr=8-1&keywords=kmc+hyper+mat]

 

For my encounter cards I use penny sleeves and the rest of my player cards are in a binder that closes via zipper.

Just curious, what type of penny sleeves do you guys use?

I use dragon shield (sleeves from when I played magic the gathering, which I will never touch again after discovering this game)  sleeves for my player decks but do not sleeve my encounter cards. I think I'm going to have to though because playing nightmare is pretty dodgy without sleeves and I am also starting to worry about damage and wear and tear now as well =\

These threads are really helpful for cheap alternatives so I will have to come back to them when I decide to finally undertake this.

I use FFG, they are very good but too big for my taste. I think im gonna switch them with mayday, i know the quality is lower but i care more for the size of the sleeve. I hope that they fit better in lotr cards than the ffg ones :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I use FFG's, and they are great. Thick, durable, good-looking. I used Ultra Pro's previously but changed to FFG because the quality was not good enough, UP's sleeves just did not feel good in my hand.

Could you explain the reasons for double-sleeving? Is it for protection or to make the handling more pleasurable? I tried it once and it did not fell or look good to me. So I am really curious.
