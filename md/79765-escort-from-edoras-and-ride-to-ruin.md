I'm sorry if there's already a thread about this, I couldn't find one.

Could you use Ride to Ruin in the action window that you have right before calculating threat vs. willpower to discard Escort from Edoras from play, therefore putting three progress tokens on a location, and still counting its willpower? Since you already know that he's going to be discarded after the quest phase is complete, this could be a useful combo.  

I'm pretty sure that this is valid, because a character who leaves play still counts its willpower to the quest if he was commited, right?

Thanks

No, sorry. If a character leaves play before quest resolution, its willpower won't be counted. So you cannot use Escort like you did. You can ether discard her for progress or use its willpower.

Hmm. Okay.  I was wrong this whole time then.  Thanks for the clarification and quick response!

Yup, same thing goes for when a questing character gets destroyed during the staging step by a revealed Treachery or Enemy. If the character is gone, then so is his Willpower.

That really sucks… Because I've been playing the other way ever since I started playing.  I don't exactly know why though… I could have sworn that I had seen it somewhere. Guess I'll have to go back and beat all the quests again the real way. sonreir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sonreir.gif]
