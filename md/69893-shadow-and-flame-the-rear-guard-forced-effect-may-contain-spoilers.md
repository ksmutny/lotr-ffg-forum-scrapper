The quest card 2b of shadow and flame says:

Forced: If at least 1 hero committed to the quest this round, place 4 progress tokens on The Rear Guard (bypassing any active location) at the end of the quest phase.

Does this effect also trigger if you just resolved quest card 1b? IMHO the end of the quest phase is after resolving the quest (which interrupts the playorder anyway) and "committed to the quest this round" means that it could be in the past, am I correct?

Thanks alot! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Correct.

If you quest successfully and complete Stage 1B, you progress to the next stage immediately (i.e., still within the quest phase). When the quest phase ends, Stage 2B will be active, and its passive effect will trigger.

I would have to agree with Starhawk77 about this, despite playing to the contrary so far.  It triggers AFTER the Quest Phase ends, so no characters are questing.  However, the cards states 'THIS ROUND' not 'THIS PHASE' and the Round hasn't finished yet, so it can trigger the 4 Progress tokens.

I am not sure if this is what the designers intended, but as worded, it is correct.  Anything to help this difficult quest is welcome and I will now play it this way until an official ruling states otherwise.  Cheers!
