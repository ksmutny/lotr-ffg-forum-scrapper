Hi all,

A doubt that came to my mind: let's say I am at 43 threat (valour threshold) and have one Knight of Dale in play, controlled by me.

Could I use both valour and normal actions?

Thanks!

Yes.

On the same turn? Wow, this ally is crazy strong because of this!

I thought you had to choose which action you want to do?

On an event, you'll have to choose, because the event gets discarded after you resolve its effect.  On an ally, like this one, you can use both if you want to. It stays in play, and there is no game text or rules anywhere which prevent you from activating the normal action (or response) while you're at 40+ threat.

I think they could just call it a Secrecy Action. Or use the "If your threat is 20 or lower..." clause again like they did in the Ringmaker cycle.
