I'm sort of scared of what Nightmare Wastes of Eriador has in store for us, but am avoiding looking so I'll be surprised.

The Carn Dum nightmare effect is going to be "Forced: Just wrap it up now.  You lose."

I am expecting an "Escape from Dol Guldur" like experience :S

 

NM Decks look good. Big fan of wastes and personally didn't have much Problems beating it so a Little more Punch could be cool.

Mount Gram was indeed way to easy, I expect a high jump in difficulty, even though it probably won't end up as one of the most difficulty quests.

Glad they force save Locations out of the Encounter deck for Etenmoors as this was my main Problem with the quest (the experience you get just changes when you get too few or to many save Locations). Sadly the new river Serpent Looks a Little unthematic in my opinion :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Wastes of Eriador: Scoop in setup.

 

Wastes of Eriador Nightmare: When you begin to think about playing, scoop.

What decks/how many players did you use for Wastes of Eriador?  I find it to be one of the most difficult scenarios to beat consistently because you cannot cancel encounter card effects for nearly half the game.  So many effects can end your game during this time.  I haven't really sat down to take another look at beating it consistently, but perhaps scrying is the answer to avoid any bad luck with draws at night.

 

Edit: I've heard the scenario is much easier solo, but the answer for any player count is probably just Boromir, since I think all the shadow cards just add damage, but it's been a while since I've played it so perhaps there is a shadow that counters Boromir.

Interesting, I never found Wastes to be that difficult. No slouch of a quest, to be sure, but I am looking forward to trying the Nightmare version for a little more challenge.

All three of these quests should be great in Nightmare, actually. Definitely picking them up!

It must just be a swingy quest.  The first time I beat it, it was a complete pushover.  However, when it is night and you reveal a second side quest and then Weight of Responsibility, you end up revealing an additional three cards, some of which may even have surge.  This can all happen before you have an opportunity to clear the initial side quest, so it's not like you can always avoid it.  But most of the losses resulted in the enemies making additional attacks during night time.  Not being able to cancel the shadow card (since it was night) makes it really hard to defend as many enemies as you need to.  It's the only scenario I've played where I felt like there was nothing my deck could do (when it was night).  It doesn't matter if you have Burning Brand, or A Test of Will etc.  These kinds of cards are fairly essential for beating most scenarios consistently since they remove a lot of the "bad luck" factor of a lot of the threats that a scenario can throw at you.  Wastes of Eriador says, no thanks!

 

My first attempt at beating the scenario was losing to our opening being > lose entire hand > side quest with surge into Weight of Responsibility which revealed a second Weight of Responsibility..  Nothing could be done (except maybe run Eleanor).  In all, I don't remember how many cards we revealed during the set up, but we basically lost at that point.  So perhaps I'm just biased due to my first experience with the scenario being a completely soul crushing one.

I'm looking forward to Nightmare Mount Gram. The developers always do a great job of punching up the easier normal quests for Nightmare mode, creating vastly different experiences. (Well, for Amon Din, the term "great" is perhaps debatable, but certainly different!)

This is my favorite cycle, so I'm really looking forward to the Nightmare version (even if I have a hard enough time with the normal version.  XD)

I'm really scared, i dont know if i will suffer playing it or enjoy ^^

 

PD: Serpent has a little bug in the text : it writes 'damaged' when it must be 'damage'

Would be funny if Escape from Mt Grahm becomes super, super difficult in nightmare mode!  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

First of I mostly Play solo, only played the quest 2 Players one time, even though I don't remember it as a big Problem, either (Can't tell you the decks anymore :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]).

For Solo I used a mono Leadership Gondor Deck (Boromir + 2 out of Sam, Aragorn, Balin; today you could use Denethor, too who can be a great defensive boost). Ressources will be generated by Stewart on Balin to give him enough ressources and Gondor trait, Card draw with King under the mountain and Erestor (ally). Questing will be boosted by Faramir and Sword that was broken if you have Aragorn. For defense Boromir and in this case Amarthuil Play the punching bag until I have enough allies out to chump block myself to victory (and hopefully end the quest before I run out of allies :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]), as Long as your threat is low enough (and in this quest it rarely is) Sam, who is usually a quest bot, if you use him instead of Aragorn, can defend a weak enemie, too (I run 2 copies of Hobbit cloak). Rest of the deck are a ton of Leadership and neutral Gondor allies, a very good tale and some other Events (pretty much can use anything here what goes great with mass allies adn even some copies of These high cost Events like doom hangs still as most of the time you will have tons of ressources after the initial rounds).

 

Now that I read your comments I might have played it wrong, even though I don't use Balin that often he surely will have canceled a bad shadow effect during the night as I thought shadow effects and Encounter Card effects are two different Things :S

Just googled it and I played it wrong -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]

Guess I have to get the quest out and replay it a bit...

What bugs me in this quest is that a torch is important during day and useless during night.
