SPOILERS (Maybe... )

 

 

i purposely put a vague title as this may contain spoilers, but i have been reading the Voice of Isengard, after you complete the last quest (i had been saving it for now :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) ...that the heroes are in a hurry to get back to gandalf and the west

 

what do you think? i hint at our next destination? after this cycle we travel back to rivendell, and perhaps get a Trollshaws/wilderlands cycle?

Yes please! Make Noldor viable. We need more Tactics and Leadership elvish heroes. Elven Mail is a major boost for fighting. I like playing elves but I want to be able to get into the fray of combat. Elladan and Elrohir are all right but you shouldn't be forced to play Leader/Tactics together.

My prediction would be next cycle Arthedain/Angmar and the cycle after that the South (Harad, Khand).

For The Three Trials they added a one page back-story on Idraen which made the insert a double wide.  Her back story took place in the north in the lands around Bree.

 

There's my conspiracy theory for today.

I hope something new and exciting. Something extremely underexplored overall.

interesting thoughts... so it seems that it would at the very least be welcome... i for one would love a breeland cycle... well, the cycle could start at breeland and take us through the wilderlands into the trollshaws and to rivendell

 

though id be just as happy going north from bree as well in the north downs
