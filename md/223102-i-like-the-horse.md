Looks like an excellent card, and a likely replacement for Unexpected Courage in some decks. Can't wait to get my hands on this pack now

Really **** good horse. It's frustrating they didn't spoil the Knight of the White Tower or include it in the list, but **** is that art sweet. O. W. Weber may just have become my new favorite artist for the game. Also, that other piece with the men of Gondor with their shields looks great. So happy for the Gondor support this cycle!

I can certainly sympathize here. I'm very eager to see the Knight of the White Tower spoiled. 

 

And I echo your enthusiasm for the Gondor support!

 

I too like the horse. Niche, but a strong niche card. As stated; superb readying for dedicated defenders, and as such an alternative to Unexpected Courage.

Probably will have to do with resources, keeping 1 resource or the amount of resources on heroes or how many heroes with resources you control (like Ingold).

 

Btw, this is a Lotr Lcg articles golden age. I hope it lasts for a while longer.

Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if they really push the power level on the Knight. Considering that all Gondor really needs now are some bomb allies. With Leadership Boromir/Visionary Leadership it has 3 will, 3 att, 3 def. Pretty fantastic.

 

I think a drawback related to resources is a fantastic guess. 

## 9 [Gizlivadi on June 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223102-i-like-the-horse/?do=findComment&comment=2275363)

I agree. Those stats alone, provided you deal with the drawback, will work really great in my mono Leadership deck. I really like the new trend of 3 defense 3 hitpoint allies like Déorwine and Guardian of Rivendell. With that said, there are so many new Leadership Gondor cards I don't know what to take out!

Too true. Especially if you're running A Very Good Tale, and therefore trying to keep about 30 allies in the deck.

 

Ah the glorious challenges of deck building.

Entangling Nets is an auto include, I think, with Damrod hero. 0 cost, replaces itself, and softens up a random enemy.

 

Outside of this; it probably depends on what sort of enemies you're facing, and what your combat potential is like without this card.

 

That said,it still seems like it would hit most enemies pretty well. The effect combined with the cost probably makes it one of the strongest trap cards.

 

I need to think more about Deorwine.

I'm thinking the Knight will be one of those cards that "benefit when played with the resources from a single hero's pool".

Entangling nets makes me want to try out GrandSpleen's Bear Trap deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/376/bear-trap-1.0]. I haven't had a chance to try it yet, but I suspect it will be a good fit.

It wasn't made up. We just don't know what's on the card cuz only the title and picture were spoiled.

Anyway... dang that's a nice horse! Too bad it be put on allies. I'd put it on my OHaUH Gandalf with Shadowfax and just go to town. It six that it requires you to have 2 enemies engaged with you (or the person you are defending for) in order to take advantage of the shadow cancellation and that you have to discard the shadows blindly (unless you're using a different card to see the shadows earlier). Still another great card that lets the Spirit players skip adding Unexpected Courage to their decks but still gets some useful reading onto the team's super defender.

Damrod Trap Deck:

 

Forest Snare

Ambush

Ranger Spikes

Entangling Nets

 

Does anyone use Ithilien Pit or Poisoned Stakes?

Ithilien Pit. Yes, but I've only ever used it with Damrod. Although the effect is marginal, it's 0 cost and replaces itself.

Whether or not I will continue to use it after Entangling Nets comes out is another thing. Might still has a home. 0 for a card is good.

I really like Ithilien Pit. What a great card, for instance against the Cross-roads. Beorn hero likes it a lot… even if you have to engage the enemy, you get ranged in coop. And as for the Net (which is amazing, of course), it is 0-cost with Damrod for a card draw: just power.

## 25 [Fingolfin Fate on June 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223102-i-like-the-horse/?do=findComment&comment=2275858)

I also feel like you almost need as many traps as you can get to have the Damrod strategy effective. Well, depending on the style of the deck, and the number of Lore heroes, Forest Snare might or might not be too expensive. Of the five other traps (of cost 1 and 2), I think Poisoned Stakes are the most situational, but I still would run 2 copies to have 14 traps in total and a quite reliable resource acceleration of sorts and card draw.

If you read the URL on that card, you'll see that it links to a .jpg entitled "Hold The Line", so we can surmise that this is the name of the card for which this art is being used.

Ithilien Pit has never worked out as well for me as I want it to. Poisoned Stakes works pretty well in this deck though: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1401/orcs-tumble-into-my-traps-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1401/orcs-tumble-into-my-traps-1.0]

Good catch. It does sound more like a Tactics card than Leadership, but I hope it is awesome whatever it is.

I use Ithilien pit in a 3-4 player fellowship where one of my friends is using Ents to handle most of the combat.  it allows them to essentially have Ranged on that particular enemy, which has been real helpful.

I'm still a little confused about how Ithilien Pit works. At first glance it doesn't seem to me that more than one character can attack it at a time if it's not engaged with them. Please tell me I'm wrong about that.

The armoured destrier could be great on Elrohir but that restricted slot it takes up is tricky. I put Elven Mail and Gondorian Shield on Elrohir so I sort of really need those two restricted slots for these cards. An extra ready and a shadow discard more or less most rounds (so long as he is featured in a "combat" deck) is pretty **** nice though! 

Some other great recipients that are not that obvious are Elrond and Tactigorn. Slap Elven Mail on Elrond and he can receive the armoured destrier and with Vilya and UC attached he can quest, ready and defend (and discard a shadow) and then ready again to use Vilya/attack if need be. Put StwB on Tactigorn and he can receive the armoured destrier and with wingfoot or UC he can quest and ready, then defend (and discard a shadow) and ready and finally attack. These situations obviously require a bit of setup but I feel like the horse can be just as useful on heroes like these as it is on the heroes it is sort of intended for (Denethor, Boromir, Faramir). Pretty much any hero that is a decent defender can benefit greatly from this attachment as it can allow them to either defend multiple times or defend then perform any other action while also discarding shadow cards at the same time. 

I feel like it is great on a hero you are using as a secondary or backup defender as well as it essentially means you can still use that hero for whatever other action they are most useful for while also defending at least one attack each turn with them and you can then discard a shadow card from an enemy you plan to defend with your main defender further providing support and minimising damage to your main defender. 

I sort of wish that it was limit 1 per character rather than restricted but it would probably be too good if that was the case..

Ithilien Pit works well for me in a mono-Lore deck, when there's a big baddie in the staging area whose engagement cost is well over my threat, and I need to kill but can't handle direct engagement. Let him sit up there and take potshots until I can defeat him.

How about using Dunedain Warning instead of the shield? Same bonus for non Gondor. Even if you're using Steward on Elrohir, this will circumvent your restricted predicament.

Armored Destrier works pretty well on Dori, too. Use him to defend the first attack, then ready and use him to boost the defense of another defending hero.

 

Mostly, I'm really happy to see the Sentinel keyword get some serious support in this pack. There's a hyper-defense deck of sorts now, with Erkenbrand, Dori, and Beregond, lots of sentinel allies, and all the great sentinel support cards.

## 35 [PsychoRocka on June 22, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/223102-i-like-the-horse/?do=findComment&comment=2277114)

I already run x3 of both Warning and the Shield.... and x2 Lorien Cloak in the other deck paired with the one Elrohir is in.... 

Need as much defense on Elrohir as possible to turn him into a wall.

 

Its just unfortunate that Lorien Cloak gives +2 instead of +1 so rarely and only in certain quests or I could potentially run x3 Cloak instead of 2 and x3 Warning and forget about the shield. 

The +2 the shield provides for 1 resource (and 1 tactics resource at that which are far less important in the deck than leadership resources) is just so **** good.... If dunedain warning was tactics I would also be more open to trying out x3 warning and x3 cloak and not running shield as leadership resources are essential for allowing Elrohir to defend multiple times to begin with.

I know I sort of shot down your suggestion but any other ideas?  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 

I was thinking of maybe adding protector of lorien but there isn't enough card draw to facilitate this in my combat deck... 
Blood of Numenor although unthematic might be a good choice.... especially if the new horse attachment is involved as it allows a free ready while defending before having to spend leadership resources for further readying. This should save a leadership resource on most turns meaning there are potentially more which can be spent on Blood if need be.... hmmm

Lembas is just great for defenders. I do not play Beregond so much any more, but I always used to pair him with an Elf, so that he could eat Lembas. Elrohir is an easier target as he is an Elf himself.

> Armored Destrier works pretty well on Dori, too. Use him to defend the first attack, then ready and use him to boost the defense of another defending hero.

I thought the same when I saw it too. Dori is quite good if you have readying, but as I only own one core set I have a limited access to UC. You could use two horses or a horse and a Ring Mail to make him a good defender (defend, ready, boost). I like decks which uses heroes for things they aren´t supposed to do, and I have a really bad deck with Grima, Dori and Arwen who uses Arwen (with LoV) and maybe Grima to quest, Dori and maybe Grima to defend and Arwen and maybe Dori to attack (Arwen uses some elven weapons). The idea is to pair Dori with a lore hero to give him "access" to a Burning Brand, but relying on Arwen to attack was a really bad idea. I think that deck needs a Glorfindel to work.
