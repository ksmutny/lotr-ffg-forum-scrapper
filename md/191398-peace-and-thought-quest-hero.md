I was thinking yesterday as I played through the hobbit quests with my outlands deck that there is no reason why one could not use the weaker Bilbo as one of your exhausted heroes!  Maybe all you have already thought of this but the implications are almost limitless!

For example, common cause actually becomes worth while.  you can exhaust Bilbo with his amazing states of 1-1-1-3 and ready Gandalf with 3-3-3-5!  And the only cost is a card that is free and only cost its value as a draw!

use your own imagination, there are so many cards that require the exhausting of a hero!

Idk, maybe I'm pointing out the obvious but this seems pretty good to me.

Don't see where Peace and Thought creates the combo...

 

You cannot exhaust the 2 heroes for Peace and Thought and use one of those exhaust for Comon Cause, because it is the same reason Nerdmeister explained on this topic [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191377-lightless-passage-fos-location/] about Cave Torch...

Yep, you can't exhaust a hero once for 2 actions. Although Common cause can be useful sometimes.

 

In what order are you using Peace... and Common... ?

I think what he's trying to say is that both cards are good with Bilbo, not that the two cards combo with each other. You use them on different rounds.

yes I am not trying to say that you could use Bilbo for both but I was just pointing out that Bilbo is a hero and can be used as one in the event above.

I think you are realizing that you can use the fourth hero you get as part of the Saga for more play options, absolutely. Part of playing the Saga well is learning to totally abuse that extra hero.
