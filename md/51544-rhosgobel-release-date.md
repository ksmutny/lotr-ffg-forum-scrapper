# [Rhosgobel Release Date](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51544-rhosgobel-release-date/)

## 1 [Shelfwear on August 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51544-rhosgobel-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=514389)

Opening another can of (Mordor?) worms, I know many of you are even still waiting to receive Hunt for Gollum, but my prediction is that "Journey to Rhosgobel" will be released within the next two weeks.

I posted the release schedule below from the German publisher here in the forum on the 12th July and was called a madman and a daydreamer (both apply btw), the same when I told you the release date for Carrock would be the 4th August (again info from the German publisher)

---------------------------------------------------------

http://www.heidelbaer.de/produktplan/ [http://www.heidelbaer.de/produktplan/]

Hunt for Gollum: July

Carock: August

Rhosgobel: August

Emyn Muil: September

Dead Marshes: September

Return to Mirkwood: October

-------------------------------------------------------

I think FFG tries to stick to the original plan that the last adventure pack from the Mirkwood cycle will be released in October (followed by a big box espansion prior Christmas??). Thats the reason Carrock was released just two weeks after Hunt for Gollum. I really believe they switched to two packs per 4-5 weeks and Rhosgobel will be released in August, prolly in the next two weeks.

And please dont tell me that this cant be because FFG hasn't announced anything - they will announce the release a few days before (like Gollum) or even one week after its release (like Carrock)...

Whether you're crazy or not, doesn't concern me.  I personally hope you're right.  I would love to get more quests for more variety.

 I'll totally admit that I have to eat crow after doubting you earlier, though I can't help but wonder if the Carrock announcement was late because of Gen Con (though, it's not like you can't set articles to post to a future date; however, the sheer number of articles posted after they got back from Gen Con suggests they didn't/don't do that).

If it does come out that soon, great. 

The last time Rhosgobel was updated on the Upcoming page by FFG was on 7/14/11 and it's "At the Printer"...so it's entirely possible you are correct! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

i sure hope you're right, more cards to tweak decks would be nice. however I hope after mirkwood they get back on the "once a month" schedule, new cards are nice but eventually my wallet will dislike me

## 5 [Narsil0420 on August 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51544-rhosgobel-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=514414)

I have a feeling that (at least) the first few packs came in the same shipment (the one that had two delays by Sauron...) which is why they could release Carrock so soon. If so, it's entirely possible that Rhosgobel is also already in their store room. They're just not updating their Upcoming page to reflect that.

## 6 [lleimmoen on August 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51544-rhosgobel-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=514429)

I'd love to see some preview of that. Now that the packs are finally beginning to arrive (I've gotten Hunt only but Carrock is sure due) they can whet the appetite a bit more again. I was not much taken by the previews of the Return to Mirkwood when the Hunt was nowhere near the stores.

Imrahil, anyone? He has been mentioned some time ago and still no picture, no news?

## 7 [koraldon on August 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51544-rhosgobel-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=514566)

Well, According to FFG upcoming page, it is indeed slated for august.
And than another pack each month. (with carrock reprinting on september)

Just hoping they already done a second print-run of those future packs - I think the fact that carrock was not announced early was due to the relativly low number they had in hand compared to the demand.

yup, you are right. and it still has:

Rhosgobel: August

The Hills: September

Dead Marshes: October

Return: Novemeber

So, their "official" status doesn't quite match up with the German publisher (why would they have info different than what is publicly known and no one else seems to have?). 

Either way, it still seems likely that the first big expansion could come in time for the holiday season!

## 9 [Slipstream on August 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51544-rhosgobel-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=514609)

I picked up my Carrock pack on Friday. My Rhosgobel set is on preorder from Paizo's site, expected early Sept. I think I'll leave it at and purposly slow my purchasing just to keep within budget. Money is tight anyways and I'm in no rush.

Anyone else notice the FFG Supply cards selling out where they are? It seems here in Seattle the stores have been cleared out.

## 10 [DurinIII on August 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51544-rhosgobel-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=514665)

 Good stuff guys. I am in Raleigh NC. Every game store around here has sold out of the first shipment of expansion packs (a good sign in my opinion).  At least around here the game is really taking off. I work at B&N Booksellers and we carry the game, though we generally receive the expansion packs about a month after my local game store gets them.  I put the LOTR core set on my staff rec, and sold two of them in the first day...making converts! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I was very (pleasantly) surprised that CatC was released so closely behind THfG, but it makes sense when you imagine that the huge delay between the release of the Core Set and the first Adventure Pack has left less time to fill with just as many adventure packs as had been planned (that is, 6 packs in 4 months instead of 6 in 6).

I am hoping that Shelfwear is right, and especially hoping that the schedule he and Dain posted ends up being accurate.  I think a first deluxe expansion in December would be fantastic!

*Fingers crossed*

CLS Games is taking pre-orders for Rhosgobel

http://boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewitem&itemid=307503 [http://boardgamegeek.com/geekstore.php3?action=viewitem&itemid=307503]

It says:

"LORD OF THE RINGS CARD GAME - JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL: $11.95
Fantasy Flight Games [FFG MEC03]
Publisher's Anticipated Release Date: Week of August 22"

That's next week.

Golum was also released on the 22th. If this should be true this might be a pattern and Hills could be released on 4th September (like Carrock)

Ooh, that's exciting!  If that pattern proves true, we could be practically inundated with adventure packs after having to wait so long for 'Gollum.

Interestingly though, I thought CatC was MEC03?

You're correct, LightDarker. Rhosgobel is MEC04.

Hey.  I'm in Chapel Hill, NC.  A little bit of an off-topic question, but since I never go to the Raleigh cardstores.  Do you know anyone at those stores who plays the A Game Of Thrones card game?

They print the entire cycle of cards for LCG chapter packs at the same time. The two CPs already released are almost sold out, hopefully they print more copies for the the next cycle (which I would guess is getting printed now).

Which Song do you think will come in Rhosgobel? Tactics?

## 20 [Shelfwear on August 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51544-rhosgobel-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=514936)

I guess no song at all as it includes Radagast as the neutral card (ally)

I've heard that the "Song of Battle" comes with The Dead Marshes, because it and Boromir were spoiled on the back of a magazine handed out at GENCON.  At least, that's what the Cardboard of the Rings guys said. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Super.

First thought about Landroval's response bearing in mind the Boromir spoiler, it say destroyed, not leaves play. So I assume you can use Boromir's action to discard him and then in response bring him back in play due Landroval. That would surely be too powerful.

Still, the card is very nice. Finally, Tactics has some edge over Spirit now as Landroval is surelly better (although I in general do not like such comparisons) than Fortune or Fate. With the above mentioned exception, the latter can bring Boromir back after he uses his action.

Also interesting, the article mentiones Self Preservation as a possible help to Wilyador but his card states that he cannot have any attachments. So I guess Glorfindel, Lore of Imladris and then new Radagast will be the only options?

Yup. I like the fact to make some of the "2nd line heroes" (that's an opinion, each player plays different :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ) shine.

And yeah, there was an error on that post, Self Preservation is an attachment, hence Wilyador can't take it.

Sadly, no.  Boromir's ability requires you to discard him to use, not destroy him.  Right now the only thing that destroys characters is them receiving damage in excess of their hit points.

I second Radiskull's statement. I think that's exactly the reason why they use "destroyed" in Landroval's ability and not "leaves play" as most other cards.

On p. 9 of the Rulebook, upper right it says (in relation to allies): "[...]remain in play until they are destroyed or removed from play by a card effect."

That proves = destruction of a card and leaving play are not the same, though after a card is destroyed (by excess damage for example) it leaves play afterwards.

Of course, I was merely stating it. They surely had Boromir already in mind - as he should come soon afterwards. I still have not seen the picture though.

The quoting is tricky, yes. 8)

 You still have four days to be right, and even if it does come in the first week of September, FFG was pretty close to getting the release out in August.

I will say that Gen Con really throws a wrench in FFG's schedule, as they take EVERYBODY to the Con, because they need absolutely every last person working there.  As I was told by one of the FFG employees demo'ing a game there last year,  there's no special sales team that they send to Gen Con, and everybody else stays home.  The entire office has to go.  The company only has about 80 employees, and they need every one of them to run a Con presence the size of what they have at Gen Con.

So if news items get postponed because of Gen Con, it's because there's literally no one back at the office to post them.

The foreign publishers arent allowed to release the APs before the English version, so far the release date was global and the same for all versions (at least this was what the German publisher told me).
