I kind of liked both quests in normal mode and the nightmare release article sounded interesting. Has anybody played the nightmare versions of these two quests yet? If so, how are they? Apart from a review, I would also be interested in seeing more card spoilers. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don,t think they are available yet. The only ones available are the nightmare decks for the Lost Realm box (the first 3 quests).

 

I hope that Mount Gram makes it more difficult!

The Nightmare Decks are available [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/8/12/travel-the-darkest-lands-of-the-north/] for the first three quests of the Angmar Awakened cycle, actually. I'm planning to pick them up, but I haven't gotten around to it yet. I'd love to hear what others think about those two quests too!

I have them ... And Waste of Eriador was one of the best NM quest !

 

Difficulty is really increased ! The new cards increase the feeling to be hunting in an hostil environment.

I detect abundance of dudes who own those nightmare packs and lack of spoilers for those packs in this thread!

Wargs that actually look like wolves? I'm surprised, FFG.

Thanks for posting these, i really liked the original Wastes of Eriador quest and also love snow art themes so i felt i had to buy this set after seeing the cards. I also bought Mount Gram which is a quest that could use a bit more bite in it. I have decided to wait on Ettenmoors which i found pretty tough anyway in solo play with one deck. They didnt stay in stock in the UK very long though.

 

I dont generally buy nightmare sets as a rule (usually get them when on sale too) unless they are either a favourite quest of mine or i really think they will add to an otherwise relatively easy quest i enjoy. It is hard to justify buying nightmare quests when you have so many other original ones you haven't found time or money to buy yet. That said you could argue i suppose it is better to have less quests that you really like with more varient options to play them than have more quests which you dont like as much. Trouble is you dont know if you will like them until you play them.
