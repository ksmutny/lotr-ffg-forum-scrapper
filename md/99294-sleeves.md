Been playing for about 2 years but haven't sleeved my cards yet since I really don't wan't to pay a ton just to keep the ink from coming of the very edges of the cards.  

 

But I think I'm might sleeve my player cards if I can get a good deal.  I want clear and cheap sleeves.  I found some cheap mayday sleeves but there are a few different types of mayday clear sleeves.  Do these look good?  http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/321317247850?lpid=82 [http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/321317247850?lpid=82]

 

Thanks

I use these. [http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Y49S14/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000Y49S14&linkCode=as2&tag=fredguit-20] They've been great and pretty consistent in size. Used about 1000 of them so far.

my local Walmart has the Ultra-Pro penny sleeves and they have been working fine for me.  100 pack for $0.98.

I did not think I need sleeves, but now, when I have them, I would not play without them again.

I paid 10 € for 500 sleeves (5 packs of 100 sleeves), Ultra Pro Premium card sleeves.

BCW Deck Guards are a good, cheap sleeve.  You can get 1000 of them for <$30 on eBay.  They're not as thick/stiff as premium sleeves, but are much better than penny sleeves.

Since i live in Bangkok i can  buy here 2000 clear sleeves for 10 usd. Feel pity for you to play a lot of money for this plastic….

Well, that's probably because everything is cheaper in Asia generally.

Muang Thai is even quite expensive considering the region.

And Krung Thep is probably the most expensive place there.

For me, Asia is cheaper; but a country like Norway is expensive.

Everything is relative to economy and salaries.
