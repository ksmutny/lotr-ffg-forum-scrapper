I'm new to the LCG scene, having just started with the recent release of Star Wars LCG.  Having said that, I demo'd LotR LCG and think it's an absolutely brilliant game and love it to death.  I purchased the core set and am however, having troubles finding the Hunt for Gollum adventure pack…well, most of the Shadows of Mirkwood adventure packs for that matter.  I thought the point of a Living Card Game was to make the sets readily available to all players?  If so, can anybody tell me when the next batch of Mirkwood packs will be available?  Ebay and even amazon has Hunt for Gollum for sale for close to $100 or more and while I love the game, I will not pay more than MSRP for the product.  

Thanks for your help!

I looked at ebay and refined my search for "completed items only". Some have gone for $5. I think it's something you will have to do a daily search and grab a cheap one when it pops up.

I did find them at FairyGlen for msrp.

Some of those packs went out of stock but are being reprinted right now…so I think you'll be able to purchase them in a few months tops.

Thanks for the replies.  I'll continue to check Ebay…but if you think they're actually in the middle of reprinting, then I will likely wait for them to come out.  I've been looking for about 2 months and was starting to get scared that the LCG game actually had an availability window that I was previously unawares of.

 

Thanks!

I was kinda hoping for a dev or moderator response.  I'm hoping that adventure packs will be reprinted at some point.

Thanks for all the suggestions.  Turns out I'm pretty stupid…as somebody already mentioned it'll be reprinted.  I finally found it on the website.  The entire Shadows of Mirkwood adventure packs will be out May-July (Q2) as indicated on the FFG website.  I didn't even realize they had release information like that on reprints.
