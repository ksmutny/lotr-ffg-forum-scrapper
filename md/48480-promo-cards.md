I've recently downloaded the amazing LOTR Deck Builder from this post [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=500373] and I'm seeing some cards on it that I don't have from the Core set. Are these promos cards? How can I get them?

Bilbo Baggins
Rivendell Minstrel
Song of Kings
Haldir of Lórien
Radagast

Thanks a lot!

Javier

They are cards from the upcoming Adventure Packs. Bilbo, the Minstrel and the Song are in the first pack, The Hunt for Gollum, which will be release later this month.

 Are you sure about the Minstrel and the Song?  I thought the 6 player cards in Hunt for Gollum were Dunedain Mark, Campfire Tales, Winged Guardian, The Eagles Are Coming!, Westfold Horse-Breaker, and Mustering the Rohirrin, am I mistaken?

There are 9 player-cards. 2 for each sphere and the neutral song-card.

Each expansion has 9 player cards, not six.  The Minstrel and the Song are among them. As is Strider's Path.

Except Haldir of Lórien, he's not gonna be out until the Journey to Rhosgobel, I believe.
