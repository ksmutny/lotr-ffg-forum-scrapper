Ok, just played my first two games with core set :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Loved it.

 

I played the passage through Mirkwood twice and both times used the leadership deck with Aragorn, Theodred and Gloin heroes. I wanted to get the feel of the game rules and mechanics for my first tries and so didnt want to mix things up with different quests or decks.

 

Really enjoyed it and one both times (yes I know its a starter quest) and didnt lose any heroes.

 

First game I made some early poor choices and both Gloin and Theodred took a chunk of damage as I didnt have any allies in play yet so they soaked on defensive moves. Rallied somewhat and pushed through to finally take the Beorn path on the last stage. I had managed to get the Aragorn pendant thingy attached to him to boost questing and so did a mad dash questing run to get loads of points on there to finish, while holding off a beastmaster with allies. A nasty little revealed treachery card did one damage to a load of characters (exhausted ones I think) which left Theodred on one remaining health, but he held on. Quest point were gained and game won :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Second game, same setup. This time I got a few allies out to soak some damage and kept heroes fresh for attacks and started much stronger. Also managed to get Aragorn pendant thingy again which helped a lot. This time, the random pick on part 3 came up as the other quest and I had 2 of 3 heroes exhausted, but I still decided to go for speed and at the quest text searched and found Ungoliant Spawn and put straight into play. On the combat phase I had enough tokens to play a Gondor Banner to up my attack (but not defense as no Gondor characters) for the round. Ungoliant Spawn came in against one of my lowly allies who soaked the damage and crumbled to nothing.  My remaining hero had his attack buffed so he did a good strike on the spider but not enough to take all that health down. Next turn, no sense in questing so everybody was ready against Ungolint Spawn. I had another gondor banner to play and so down it went sending a buff around the party. The spider received another lowly ally as its defender and the poor sole simply perished. I then exhaused every remaining card as attackers, all buffed and did enough damage to take the spider down, which was good as next turn my threat would have increased to a level that there was an orcish card sat in staging waiting to join the fray, that would not have helped. All heroes did still have some damage this game, but not near as much as the last.

 

Overall, I had great fun!!

It involved a lot of leafing through the rulebook trying to get things right and remember rules, but that is to be expected in a new game. Generally I felt the rules played really well especially as a solo player

 

I was very happy with the games, and am very much looking forward to getting to the point where I know the rules well enough to mix in a lot of advance cards, later quests and some considered deck building. While it did need some rule-thinking, it ran very smooth for a first attempt and I am really looking forward to the game getting better and better.

 

My next plan for a game session will be to try a different starter deck with passage through Mirkwood, and go straight through into journey down the anduin. That way, I stick with the same easy first encounter, but spice it with a new deck, then jump into a new adventure with that same deck afterwards. Very much looking forward to it.

 

Thought it would be nice to put a post up about this first experience and also to say thank you to all those people on the forum who have given me advice over the last two weeks in my new foray into this game. It helped me with the choice to buy the game, heped me with choices over first purchases and accessories such as sleeves, carry cases, playmats etc. All advice has been appreciated and the results of this afternoons play are that it was all worth it.

Thank you very much.

On with the adventuring!!

Welcome to the game!  Sounds like you had some memorable experiences.

 

I noticed in your second game that you didn't quest at all so you could kill Ungoliant's Spawn.  I just want to make sure that you still revealed an encounter card and raised your threat for questing unsuccessfully.  That is a mistake some new players make.  You still need to do all of the questing steps even if you don't actually send anyone to the quest.

 

Be prepared to lose repeatedly when you play Journey Down the Anduin, especially with the premade starter decks.  Don't let it discourage you.

Don't try to play mono-tactics.

Glad to hear you're enjoying it so far. The Leadership deck is a good all-round deck with plenty of resources, decent questing and combat. Definitely try some of the other spheres as well - they all feel different. Though as Bullroarer hints, Tactics is difficult solo because it lacks questing power and is usually paired with another sphere, or another player plays a willpower-heavy deck.

 

Without spoiling it for you, JDtA is significantly harder than PtM and it may take a few tries before you find a build and strategy that works, but don't lose heart. This game just gets better the further you get and find what playstyle suits you and which cards you want to invest in. I've had many hours of fun with this game, though we usually remember the matches themselves with despair rather than fondness.

At the moment I want to concentrate on getting the rules to be second-nature, so that then I can concentrate on how to play my deck/decks. Right now most of my concentration is on getting used to the rules.

 

I actually didnt reveal encounter and raise threat, I thought that was done against questing characters and as none were questing, I didnt. Thanks for pointing out my error I will know next time. So basically, every turn the questing phase will reveal a card and if I dont meet that with some for of questing character I will have threat raised. Actually makes sense glad to know about that thank you. I was sure I would make some mistakes before getting used to it.

 

I do plan on having some games with each individual mono-deck. That way I should get a feel for where they work and where they are weak. That will be my basis for then creating composite decks to try and get some good complimentay things going. Right now I dont know enough about the decks to have an informed opinion of merging them, ive not even leafed through them.

 

Thanks for the feedback and thanks for the correction too.

 

Onwards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Edit: Ungoliant Spawn quest having zero quest points on it did a lot for me avoiding questing on it, but had I realized I still needed to meet the threat it would have been different :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Extra edit: thinking about it, im glad Ive been corrected on the rules aspect, though thinking about it the result would have been similar (subject to the new card) as Aragorn and Theodred questing as a combo gives a decent quest score and Theodreds ability gives aragorn an extra resource he can use to ready himself, so I was getting a good quest score with only Theodred exhausted. Theodreds attack wouldnt have affected the outcome of the spider, so as long as the encounter card from questing wasnt game-changing (which it could be) then I think it would have ended same :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Definitely try all four starter decks. Don't be surprised, however, when you find that they aren't balanced well for solo play. Once you have an understanding of what each sphere does well (and doesn't do well) you're probably going to find it necessary to do a little custom deck building to have a chance at the later quests solo.

Glad to hear you're having fun so far!

It's always great to hear of new peoples' experiences with the game - really pleased you had fun with it! 

 

I'd just like to second everyone else who has been warning against the difficulty of some of the later quests. I've been playing this solo for years, but being primarily a theme player, still regularly fail to complete quests. Don't let it discourage you! They may be awfully hard, but they're usually fantastic for having epic storytelling moments!

## 8 [alexbobspoons on March 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1513210)

Well ive slightly revised my plans.

I do plan to buy everything I can (cashflow permitting) as it appears, dont want to be held up by stock levels.

I do plan to play everything in order (maybe some sagas out of sync) even to the extent of not using extra player cards until i am on that expansion.

So pkaying everything in order and a good many times each quest.

After reading Beorns path (awesome) the deck building aspect really opened up, so i do need to know the strengths and weaknesses of each sphere, hence i plan to play the first scenario at least once (prob twice) to get used to the decks before doing some deck building. Beorns path lore/leadership decks was inspired.

So i want to be used to decks first, then build, then tackle scenarios in release order.

Good fun ahead

## 9 [alexbobspoons on April 1, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1518521)

Just played game 3, pasage through mirkwood with core lore deck, i got smashed to bits. Fun though. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Really early I dew Ungoliant spawn, dol guldur beastmaster and i think was dol guldur orcs. I had stated out with a threat of 30 and lost the first round of questing so ungoliant only spent one turn stuck in staging before engaging and everything else engaged quickly too.

I hadnt enough allies out to defend and attack and quest. Forest trap never drew which would have fixed ungoliant. Gandalf never drew. Id also been hit bad damage on all heroes (was a shadow or treachery) and denethor got caught in a web.

Just couldnt defend and attack and quest and died a bit more each turn.

 

Some initial lore observations:

Glorfindel is pretty rock hard

Denethor had good defense before being webbed

The deck has buckets and buckets of healing

Wasnt easy to quest with the deck

Not very hard hitting

Would have had good extra draw abilities if id played resources differently, to maybe get out cards like forest trap, but I needed resources to heal.

 

I can see why this works so well in conjunction with leadership on beorns path website suggstions, but i found it difficult on its own.

 

Next play will be a repeat of the same scenario with same deck before I move on to a different sphere again.

Yeah, the mono-sphere starter decks are incredibly weak. I found that the only one that could consistently beat Passage Through Mirkwood was the Leadership deck. I think I won once or twice with the Spirit deck. Never with Lore or Tactics (the latter I believe is impossible… Tactics simply don't have the will power required to quest successfully). Still, I'd say give it a try so that you get a better sense of the different strengths and weaknesses of each sphere. 

## 11 [alexbobspoons on April 1, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1519412)

Thanks thats good to know.

 

I plan to play Passage through Mirkwood with each sphere as mono-core to do exactly that, but plan to do it twice as sometimes bad draws from deck or encounter can both have a heavy impact on game, so two plays from each sphere as my foundation for my knowledge before I move on to other adventures.

 

Afterwards, whichever deck I feel most easy to my play I also want to try Journey Down The Anduin as a mono-core-deck just to see how that fairs (Leadership current favourite) because I read Beorn's Path and it was fantastic, but I feel the deck design was so good that it would taint my own design thoughts without further experience. So Id like to mono that adventure (and likely get beat) to see where I fell down and then probably adopt the Beorns Path format to have another go at it. Future advventures I want to avoid reading up on as I dont want to affect my choices in deck building (which is really hard as reading about those adventures is such fun and exciting).

 

So plan now:

1: PTM lore mono GO2

2: PTM Spirit mono GO1

3: PTM Spirit mono GO2

4: PTM Tactics mono GO1

5: PTM Tactics mono GO2

6: JDTA (leadership or spirit probably) mono

7: JDTA Constructed deck (Beorns Path design)

8: All other scenarios in order with constructed decks each time making adjustments (this is the point Im looking forward to even more)

 

In order I now have all up to and including Khazad Dum so that will be my plan (I also have Black Riders and so will slot that in somewhere along the way as some play sessions).

I plan to buy packs when I have the cash available and/or they are in stock, but not introduce player cards or heroes into my collection until I am playing those scenarios. I then do want to take scenarios in order (as well as going back and replaying my favourites when I find new deck tweaks).

 

I must admit, Leadership seem to tackle PTM pretty well even on my first go's, but Lore just really taxed me and was hard. As a starting adventure with really low difficulty rating I found this somewhat worrying, however I can imagine a Leadership deck interspersed with healing and traps from Lore would completely demolish PTM too. Its good to see your comments TwiceBornh on PTM being shocking with Lore or Tactics mono, gives me hope :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Cheers!

Leadership and Lore build into a very nice two-sphere deck too. I don't solo play often, but I have run an Aragorn, Theodred, Denethor deck through Passage Through Mirkwood and it went smoothly. I would imagine that Spirit and Tactics would do well enough there too, particularly if you got the free ready attachment from Spirit onto Gimli for double duty blocking and attacking. Eowyn, Thalin, and Gimli are pretty interesting together for a core trio.

## 13 [alexbobspoons on April 5, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1527758)

Another two fun games played:

 

1: ptm lore mono go2: won this time yay!! Admittedly Gandalf turning up helped. Also, I had a nasty orc captain person who had a forced damage upon me at engagement which simply killed Denethor as I had nothing to reduce the damage (had things to heal damage but the amount killed Denethor in one go and you cant heal a dead hero). This captain seemed very tough against these heroes with I think defense of 3 and 6 damage points. Fortunately i pinned him with forest-trap which meant I only had to navigate his shadow cards each turn (im assuming he still gets dealt them even when trapped as he is still engaged with me technically).

Was a ruch to the finish to get the last 10 quest tokens before the threat rose too much and yay suceeded.

 

2:

Second game today i tried ptm with spirit mono... got smashed. Could quest pretty well but had hardly any allies to put up so once i had threef forest spiders against three heroes it wasnt good. With three attacks coming in and 3 heroes, did i defend all three and do no damage to them, with no questing raising threat, or if i attack them i am leaving undefended andthus full damage. I simply got mangled. Not enough allies to chump block or help with questing. Too many spiders too quickly.

 

Will try ptm again mono spirit before moving onto the final sphere of tactics.

Well, I built two decks using only Core set cards, with Leadership/Lore in one and Tactic/Spirit the next. My brother and I tried the Passage Through Mirkwood scenario and learned the rules as we go, and I think we definitely made some errors along the way. First, it was hard to work with the resources that we generate, since each hero only produce one during the Resource phase. I know there are cards that can produce more, but we either didn't draw them or didn't have them. Also, without Allies the heroes do take a beating, and since attacking exhaust your characters you have to assign one character for questing so others can be ready for attacking later. Anyway, I think we played the game somewhat wrong but that was our observation in our first two-player game. 

 

Next time, I will incorporate other cards from the expansions and adventure packs to strengthen the decks and eliminate much of the weaknesses.

Thank you thats nice to hear as I am enjoying writing about them a lot and loving the game.

I tend to go overboard with spending when I like something new so already have core plus 6ap 2deluxe and 1saga so if i didnt do this methodically i wouldnt have a clue and would be swamped by my cardpool.

Its only really ptm that I intend to specifically play this much as my intro, after that i will play other scenarios in order but only as much as I fancy at the time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 3 more games until Anduin!

## 17 [alexbobspoons on April 6, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1528918)

Ok another two fun games:

 

1: ptm go2 on spirit. Lost again but did do better. Did really suffer from simply not enough allies. Once you have a few enemies engaged i just didnt have enough to defend and atack at same time. Trod water afew turns then risked undefended atacks to do some damage but lost heros.

 

:  ptm go1 on tactics: woah tactics are rock hard. BUT nothing to quest with. I got stuck with four locations in staging that had more than all my willpower combined so even though i could mincemeat any enemy, questing failed badly every turn until i bust the limit at 50. Ill have another solo before I design my first deck, but I dont expect to win. I think tactics would work very well with spirit or lore but difficult to quest on its own. Spirit quested ok but not enough allies to hold in combat, so spirit/tactics may be good while lore/leadership works well too.

One more go at ptm with mono tactics before I choose a deck design and either replay ptm a seventh time or have a crack at journey down the anduin.

Two more games:

1st mono tactics again on ptm. Did much better but still lost. Just cant qust well and the threat goes up then swamped in monsters.

 

Then I designed my first deck, lore/leadership with Aragorn, Theodred and Denethor. As it was first senario i went for 40 cards and have put aside another 10 to make it fully legal later.

Went well. Denethor hardly drew any cards so had lots of spare resource so playing Gandalf against Ungoliant Spawn was easy. A clear win.

 

Next, ill put my deck to the full 50 (even though that means some cards im not too thrilled about) and a journey down the anduin.

## 20 [Authraw on April 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1530954)

You may find it more fun to use your 40 card deck while you're just playing with the core set. There really aren't enough good cards to fill a standard 50 card deck, and it can be especially frustrating solo to have to glut your deck with substandard cards.

If it helps, you'll note that there technically isn't a minimum deck size for this game -- they call 50 cards a "tournament legal" deck but the "standard rules" don't impose that limitation.

Once you have a few expansions in your card pool, you should have no problem filling out a 50 card deck, and throwing in "junk cards" will become a thing of the past.

## 21 [alexbobspoons on April 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1537059)

I stuck with 40 cards and have had 3 goes at journey down the anduin.

 

First two just got overwhelmed early. A extra staging card plus troll plus usual turn 1 staging card puts 3 cards in the staging area straight away. Just got mashed as the troll jumps in and raises your threat count so high that other enemies then engage and burry you. Neither time did I manage to get Gandalf of Forest Snare on him.

3rd go I took out the troll through sheer beating, which did mean by that time it had taken turns and my threat was higher. I finally got to stage 2 and wow 16 quest points to get while the deck is adding TWO cards to its threat pool per turn gosh. I was making progress but not fast enough and I bust the 50 threat limit.

I had two steward of gondor cards running so had masses of resources just not the cards to play. I may give this build another go before considering a bit more card draw into the mix :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The marsh adder was a cool card/enemy to fight. Also the **** wargs kept engaging, attacking (occuping a defender) and zero shadow card so jumped back to staging before I could damage them. Tied up Denethor for quite some turns without damaging them before the raft phase trapped them in staging.

## 22 [Khamul The Easterling on April 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1537572)

I noticed you said you had two steward of gondor cards out and running. As indicated by the little diamond emblem right next to the title on the card, steward of gondor is unique. Only one copy of a unique card can be in play at a time. So really you can only have one copy of steward of gondor in play. I made that mistake too when I first started playing! That's pretty crazy you got all the way tostage 3 on Anduin though! You killed the hill troll and everything! I must say, most new players take much much longer to achieve such success on that quest. I do believe you are having a great and smooth introduction to this game compared to many others. Good job!!

2 stewards at the same time? That some real business going on! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Eek i didnt notice the little star on steward of gondor oops. Ive generally been looking for that star on allies more than anything so i made a mistake there thanks.

 

I didnt get to stage three though. I was in stage two and just couldnt get the 16 questing points before i bust the 50 threat. I was trying to engage enemies by choice to get the staging areas threat amount down but with two cards revealled per questing phase i just didnt have enough characters to quest sucessfully and fight as well. All the cards seemed to be monsters with high threat (if they were locations can you still travel to them despite being on a raft? Id think so as nothing says you cant).

I do think a key to this is a good first draw on those initial staging area cards, then being able to deal with the troll quickly, so that you can rush up your 8 questing points to get on that barge and rumble through the 16 points before the staging area is too full to quest against.

Some of the enemies seem pretty strong against my heros and allies in this deck too.

Thanks i will give it a look. First want to try a few of my own deck tweaks to see if i can manage it. Even if i hadnt made my mistake with the stewards i would have had lots of resource and no cards to play, so i think i have underestimated the value of card draw. More card draw would hopefully have meant i could have spent resources to pull more cards into play to tackle enemies better while questing quicker before that 50 threat bust. May even have pulled Gandalf in to chop that scary threat back.

Hey my thread has the "hot" icon next to it now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Again thanks for everyones comments and advice.

Hey hey hey ive been down the anduin :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Another two games

Game one, fail, spectacularly again, though my deck tweaks for added card draw did make things better (gleowine mainly).

I decided Denethor hadnt been pulling his weight. I hadnt had a chance to use his ability much and his defense is great but chump blocking may have been as good. So I decided to swap him out. Berevor was the obvious choice with good all round stats and a 2 card draw ability.

But...

That would up my starting threat to get the troll attaking almost straightaway. So reluctantly I swapped out Aragorn too for Gloin.

 

With swapped heroes I went for go2 and won.

With a lower starting threat I had an extra turn or two before trollness. I used this extra time to get Berevor drawing cards a-plenty. She became steward of gondor so got lots of resource.

My first draw of encounter card in setup was genuinely a troll. Great luck as it meant no extra staging card and gave me extra chances to quest against low threat.

By the time the troll attacked i had a forest snare to throw at it. I had also drawn two gandalfs so played one and dropped the threat right back down then in combat gandalf helped damage. Galdalfs threat drop sort of cancelled the trolls first hit (before i snared it) with its splash damage to threat. So after that i had the troll snared with damage on it, ok threat level and all heroes in play. Not too long then to kill the troll.

I got a daughter of nimrodel in play and she worked in tandem with gloin against general attacks, he took damage and gained resource while she healed the damage. Theodred got the amulet thingy so became a good questor (adding another resource), Berevor had lots of resoure and kept up card draw and i got faramir out to aid questing. Lots of card draw with lots of resource meant lots of allies, which in turn with faramir meant really high questing and with enough allies that along the raft ride i was able to keep selectively engaging enemies to keep the staging area as low as possible and block/attack them to clear them.

I drew a sneak attack and nearly used it with my second galdalf against the marsh adder (first galdalf obviously in discard pile long ago) but had enough allies to save it for the final fight.

By the time i got to final fight i had an army of allies and only three enemies to engage and a threat of 43.

I played the gandalf even though didnt need to, his initial damage removed one enemy and his attack another so the ally army didnt have much to do to win. Wahey.

I do think i had good luck. Troll as first draw was great and troll 2 vanished as a shadow card. Gandalf were great help (thanks card draw). The nasty Orc Chieftain bloke never made it out of the encounter deck (which was very small by the end). I did have good luck.

Gloin teamed with a healer was awesome. Berevors card draw was so valuable too.

Great game, good win and im happy with the deck/hero tweaks i made.

 

Going to give the same deck another go at anduin to see how it fares when the draws are not as lucky :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Gloin, Theodred and Beravor, eh? Never used that combo -- glad it worked for you. I may have to try it some day! Core Leadership starter deck vs. Passage Through Mirkwood notwithstanding, I never made use of Gloin until Khazad-Dum… and yes, I agree, he can be quite useful when used in tandem with an ally healer, Self-Preservation, Citadel Plate, etc.

Thanks

I think the main reason the combo worked was lower starting threat with big card draw to get things setup before the troll. The Gloin healing combo was added bonus, as was the questing strength of Theodred/amulet/faramir+allies. 

There were some lucky draws though so will be interesting how the same deck handles a second go at it.

Another two anduin games with my previously sucessful deck, both losses.

 

First, just didnt get cards i wanted from draw or mulligan and struggled from the off. Very few carrds out, troll raised threat, enemies engaged, Theodred died, other two heroes took damage and then a treachery card did damage to all characters whixh finished the heroes.

 

Second go went alot better, got over half way through stage 2 before i bust the 50 threat.

I took a while against the troll, lost theodred again but snared the troll and unfortunately engaged the orc chieftan too. Got to stage 2, had steward of gondor on gloin and he ended up with a ridiculous amount of resource. Things were going ok questing and trying to keep enemies out of staging but i drew a lot of locations and struggled to quest against, took too long and bust 50 threat.

 

Despite two losses, i was still happy with how the deck performed, just made some wrong choices and some difficult card draws.

 

Good fun though. Think i will stick with anduin a bit more before either moving to dol guldur (to lose hehe) or am thinking of maybe building a spirit/tactic deck to give that a try from core :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Another Anduin an a victory yay.

 

Starting staging card was a treachery removing progress, of which there was none, so that was good. Then I drew a corker starting hand which included forest snare, son of arnor, sneak attack and steward of gondor, awesome, then my first card draw was a gandalf. I thought it was in the bag. Then I made my mistake. As I had low starting threat i decided to wait a bit before arnor/snare combo on the troll, yet i drew some really high threat in staging and broke my questing and ended up with the troll engaging me early. I sneak attacked Gandalf to lower threat back and defend against the troll. I then started to get smaller enemies engaging and was struggling questing, and two of the location appeared in staging that has about three threat but needs 2 card discards to travel. Id just drawn a second gandalf to go with my first which had returned to my hand, decided i had to get some questing done so needed to clear some locations from staging... so I shuffled my hand... discarded two.......DISASTER....both gandalfs.....oh no.

Managed to clear enemies and then slowly kill the snared troll. Once I got onto the raft I had a lot of allies out, many resources, high questing and not many cards in my hand. Quested the full anduin 16 points in only two turns and had a few enemies waiting for the ambush including a beastmaster and the chieftan, but my threat by now was up to 47 so threat was a real worry. I also drew a card that did 1 damage to all characters which killed about 4 allies in one go. Got a second snare on the chieftan and drew the third gandalf yay, gandalf to the rescue. Gandalf played for 5points, reduced threat back to a safe level and then did some damage in combat. Remainder of my allies chump blocked and heroes finished remaining enemies for the win.

No dead heros yay. Nice win.

Started so well, went really downhill and then came back good again.

Lot of luck on the draws both good and bad.

Should have arnor/snared the troll as soon as i was able.

Enjoyable game.

 

Now not sure if to design a new deck, tactics/spirit to have a go at anduin or whether to take my leadership/lore into dol guldur :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Tried my spirit/tactics deck on Mirkwood and demolished it.

 

Tried on Anduin twice and got bashed.

First, high threat location drew first turn, bust questing and engaged troll who killed me pretty fast.

Second, troll still engaged too quick but after losing Gimli i fought it off a long time. I had excess progress on the quest and on the exact turn of killing blow to troll, drew another troll who engaged before i killed other troll (thus before quest finished). Couldnt handle a second troll, died.

 

Decided to finish the session with an Anduin from my cherrished successful lore/leadership deck.

Was doing pretty well on first quest, troll took an age due to lack of forest trap or gandalf so it was raising threat quite a bit... then I drew a surge, which produced a surge, and another, all engaged, so I had 3 enemies plus troll, too much, died.

 

Maybe a new experience next, a shot at dying in dol guldur

Oh, Dol Guldur is like Anduin x10, man. It's doable in multiplayer, but in single... good luck.

## 34 [TwiceBorn on April 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1581371)

Yeah, I created a thread documenting my experiences vs. Dol Guldur straight solo (and 2-handed) using Core set cards only. Like Trololo says, Dol Guldur is beatable (though very challenging) with a 2-hands or 2-players using a single Core set.

 

I managed to beat it once (I think) straight solo in so-called "easy mode" (nothing easy about it) using a single Core set.

 

I have beaten it 5 or 6 times straight solo in standard mode (with random prisoner draw) using the equivalent of Core x3.

 

All in all I think the ratio of victories vs. solo games played was between 5% and 10% (depending on difficulty level, etc., and that was over 70 games or so!). I can provide a link if you want to see more details on the experience… but whether you play standard or easy mode, be prepared for a lot of cursing and gnashing of teeth if you play straight solo! 

 

I'm sure it probably gets a bit easier with a broader card pool, though I have yet to try. 

 

It's brutal, and in my opinion, should not have been included in the Core set… good luck!

 

EDIT: The vast majority of my attempts (and all victories) were with 50-card decks.

Im pretty much resigned to failure from everything ive read. I plan to play it a few times losing then move on to hunt for golum, probably to return later with a wider card pool. But for now it will be for the experience with an expectation of loss.

Ive had another three losses at Anduin.

Thinking of tweaking the deck, remove a few allies that seem expensive as chump blockers, also considering swapping out Berevor for Denethor. Her card draw has been awesome, but ive found the past few games Ive needed to quest her early in anduin to avoid threat busting and just not got to her draw ability, maybe I would be better with Denethors defense. Also ive had some good things from Henemarth so starting to see Denethors ability as better than I did (drawing an extra troll just as the first engaged was bad, two trolls in one turn).

I think I may try this with keeping Gloin for the lower starting threat. Id like to revist Aragorn but the threat just seems high against the troll.

 

I also had another case of surge mania which added two enemies to engage and one had the shadow card wolf rider so it was three extra engages in one turn eek.

 

Ive decided id like to beat Anduin one more time before moving on to dol guldur (then quickly on to hunt for Gollum) May need these deck tweaks though.

## 40 [alexbobspoons on April 24, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1592092)

Hmm another three losses.

 

Loss 1: usual lore/leadership deck. Just didnt cut it, cant fully recall what went wrong. Killed by sniper over few turns and evil storm

 

Loss2: swapped out berevor for denethor. Got to the final fight, but had too many enemies and not enough allies. My turn that instigated phase3 used most of my party, so I found myself being ambushed after the quest phase with most exhausted. Slowly died against too many enemies , 6 i think including two beastmasters.

 

Loss3: drew all the right cards in starting hand and got troll snared, but i got three high threat cards in staging and kept busting questing. My total will of all characters was less than staging area so even questing everyone I still lost every turn and it just got worse, couldnt clear any locations so just watched the threat go all the way to 50

 

Not sure what to do next.

Maybe try again with this deck, or swap berevor/denethor, or swap b/d as well as gloin/aragorn....to get heavier hitter. Maybe slim the deck down a bit to get better card draw. Maybe try tactics/spirit again.... maybe try tri-sphere.

 

I do still want to beat Anduin again before moving to dol guldur and then hunting gollum.

Haha its funny you should say that, after posting my last message, I went over to re-read you 50card trisphere decklist with a view to trying it after having one more lore/leadership with aragorn.

Im a little worried about hitting power with the heroes, and a bit worried about card-draw/resources for trisphere, but the list has great cards in it and looking forward to trying it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I had two goes with the aragorn set, one got beaten in final fight, other got threat bust on raft.

Went for the denethor eowyn dunhere combo (used the deck from your thread Twicebornh, the 1st september post) have to say i got totally thrashed twice.

The deck quests fantastic!! Eowyn is awesome and the low starting threat brilliant, but in both cases when the troll came I had no snares and simply not enough offensive to damage them :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] so just got killed. I just couldnt do any damage to them even adding everyones attack.

Maybe it was just poor draw on allies.

wandering took seems expensive too in solo when his ability is useless.

will give the deck another try though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Awww… But yeah, you really need to get Forest Snare in your starting hand or shortly thereafter to succeed with Eowyn, Dunhere and Denethor.

## 45 [alexbobspoons on April 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1594519)

So some interesting games.

I decided to give the gimli/theodred/eowyn deck from BGG a try.

 

Three losses at anduin. The threat starts at 28 and I always had staging cards that needed to be dealt with and Eowyn couldnt quest enough on her own to avoid threat gain and engaging troll.

Still generally managed to kill the troll (once was two trolls, couldnt handle that) and twice onto raft but couldnt quest quick enough and was overwhelmed.

 

Thats quite a few anduin losses now, was a little disheartened.

 

Decide to have a pop at dol guldur with same deck. What the heck is that quest. Three cards (guards) in the starting area plus one to reveal at staging... so four cards, yet only two heroes and not enough resources to play allies yet.

Theodred just died in turn 1 by being overwhelmed by engaging enemies then eowyn on her own could quest but nothing else. Died.

Two other games fairly similar. With so little for the player and so much starting in staging, theres a lot of luck in the solo start of this quest.

 

After the three losses i felt like something new, so i moved hunt for gollum into my playbox. Some nice cards, stuck with same deck but added Dunedain mark to it from the new cards.

Setup and played. Smashed it to victory.

Managed to get my clue late on so treacheries losing clues werent damaging. Eown got celebrians stone so with a discard was questing for 7 even without help. The various encounter draw conditions were fun and did add more to staging each turn than im used to (except anduin raft) but powered through it to victory with one clue.

 

Was nice to end the session on a victory. I think i will go back to Anduin with a latter deck and dol guldur probably when i feel like two handed, but for now i think a good number of plays at hunt for Gollum will be keeping me busy for a time. A few more plays with this deck and i may rebuild my lore/leadership deck and try that too. I do think Eowyns questing is a bonus on this quest.

Interesting to hear your experiences as you journey through this game!  It's fun to think back a few years ago when I was just in your place doing the exact same stuff!  Sounds like you are having a good time with the game!  Will be fun to hear your thoughts and experiences as you begin the Mirkwood cycle. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Another two hunt for gollum games and another two wins yay!

 

I do think this deck is really well suited to this quest.

Questing hard gets you through it quicker. Eowyn is great at questing and when she gets Lorien Guide or Northern tracker out that works great, add in Faramir and the questing goes nuclear. Theodred shunts extra resources to Eowns expensive cards which works well. All the while, Gimli can throw his two WP against the quest as well because you almost want him to take an undefended attack just to get his own attack power up and into the mix.

If you then get unexpected courage onto Gimli, you can quest with him and attack beasties (needing an undefended attack, a feint/quickstrike or a chump blocker to take the fall) Snowborn Scout is great for that chump blocker while his play-ability just adds to the questing-monster.

So throwing all this questing power into it really helps.

Any clues go on Eownyn first as she isnt going to go into combat so her danger of losing is down to cards damaging all characters, or is  down to treachery cards getting rid of clues. Theodred takes the second clue... I havent got a thrid clue yet but I suspect Gimli would lose it quickly.

 

The extra staging cards coming up doesnt help, but the way in which they are chosen in stages 1and2 does help to avoid nasty treachery or nasty Morder Hunters. This does make some nasties easier to avoid.

 

My last game, I did have to engage the Mordor Hunters and they were nasty as I had two clues at that point, but it was so close to the end of the game that I met the winning quest point before they had killed me or me killed them. I still had another chump blocker though so would have almost killed them before I got to the point of needing to take damage on a hero or a valued card (Faramir, Northern Scout or Lorien Guide).

 

Its a fun quest and its nice to be winning. Its not an eyes-closed win which is good too.

I think I will play a couple more games of this with this deck before trying a different deck against it. I think Leadership/Lore would be fun against it and probably a harder challenge without the questing aspects of Eowyn and her Spirit allies.

 

Onwards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

 

Hmm I just thought.........Have I been doing something wrong..... when you are doing a "look at the two/three cards and chose one for staging and discard the others" am I playing it correctly that any "when revealled" effects only kick-in on the card you  CHOOSE not on the cards you are discarding?? Because the cards you are discarding you are only "looking" at, they arent in play so are not revealled. The card you put into staging is  in play and revealled. Is this right or should I be applying ALL "when revealled" aspects of all the cards even the ones I am discarding???

Nope, only resolve the when revealed effects of the card you put into the staging area.  The other two cards do nothing and are discarded.  Although it can occasionally provide a great challenge, The Hunt For Gollum generally isn't too tough of a quest, so having a good win/loss ratio against it is quite average!  

## 49 [alexbobspoons on April 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1596260)

Thanks, glad im doing it right and good my wins are thus indeed wins.

Its a nice scenario.

I feel if it went wrong, you would be resetting to stage two repeatedly, or having to go through the encounter deck numerous times to dig out clues, or facing buffed up strong mordor agents.... but I feel the quest also seems to give you more than one chance to avoid those eventualities, which makes it a quest where playing the cards right is often a win and making mistakes could lead to loss, while luck being a lesser factor than it is in say Journey Anduin.

I think this may make the quest seem easier to experienced good players, while for me it is a nice balanced quest for a newbie.

Its almost like taking passage through mirkwood and adding mechanics for interest.

Enjoying it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Conflict at the Carrock is a very fun quest that I pull out of the box quite often, but in solo play the trolls can kick your butt if you're not prepared.  You will get Frodo in that pack though, and he's great at this quest.

Hehe awesome, Ive seen people mention its a difficult one, so no illusions about doing well on it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Trying not to peek at the cards as I want to enjoy and explore each expansion on its own before moving on to the next. My buying pace is much much further ahead than my playing pace, so I need to be careful not to flood the play experience.

Hunt for Gollum is a little bit harder with 4 players. It is a lot easier with a solo player or 2 players.

 

Conflict is really hard the first time you go through it, but get a lot easier to beat after you discover how.

 

Another thing, I'm not sure, but one of my mistakes early when I didn't knew the rules too well was assign undefended damage to allies. There was one of your comments that gave me the impression that you were doing it, not sure.

Nope, not assigning undefended damage to allies :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  only goes on heroes (not sure where I game that impression but havent done it)

I can assign "defended" damage to allies (usually killing them) but thats a different matter.

A great description for Conflict at the Carrok quest would be its like a puzzle. When you first play it its hard to figure out but after you beat it a couple times, it will go from one of the hardest quests to one of the very easiest quests.

I agree with Khamul. Even straight solo, I only lost my first couple of games vs. Carrock, but have seldom lost since. Once you figure out the "formula," it ends up being one of the easiest quests in the game. Still a fun one to discover… and my GF likes playing it with me 2-player, so bonus points there!

Great stuff looking forward very much to Carrock now, but need to get a good number of play on huntygollum first as well as try some variant decks with huntygollum (and build up some (hopefully) wins before Carrock smashes me hehe)

## 57 [alexbobspoons on May 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1604273)

Oooh two good game at huntygollum with same trisphere deck.

Id decided I would have one more go at it before trying a leadership/lore deck against it as the current one seemed to do so well...

 

So game1, i smashed the quest again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] good fun and through to victory. But it was so quick I thought, yeah another go with this deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ... i lost! It was so tense.

 

Turn one the setup was a clue, so i drew a guard card and it wad hunters from mordor. Yikes before I even start I have 4 threat in staging from a 4attack enemy. This will be plus the first staging card.

The game was tense, i kept clearing a mordor hunter just one turn after another had surfaced, so kept struggling with questing while trying to block/kill them while locations started to build up in staging. Couldnt get enough allies out to tackle the hunters (afterwards I checks and I had needed to engage every single hunters in the deck, didnt manage to discard any). Kept losing allies to blocking, gimli had the plate armour but maxed on damage so he was hitting for awesome amounts but only once per turn wasnt enough.

I finally lost all my heroes as two hunters engaged due to threat (losing questing) and I couldnt block and attack them both through two turns and lost heroes, game over. Threat was about 36 (id reduced it twice through the game through the spirit card and gandalf) there were only two cards left in the encounter deck before a reset.

Felt like an epic battle to the final loss. Very fun.

Has made me want to complete this quest once more with this deck before trying a leadership/lore against it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Real fun two games!!

Another win against huntygollum. Hard fighting and hard questing this time, but still success.

Next will be same game with a lore/leadership deck. I think it will be a lot harder without Gimlis high damage and Eowyns high wp

Thank you very much thats nice of you to say :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I am enjoying making the posts, the fact that some enjoy reading them is a bonus and very nice to know.

 

Regarding the collection....Oooooh you dont know the half of it.. I have a big number birthday coming up and my wife wanted to get me an expensive amount of cards (to match her jewellery gift size as she had a big number this year too). Basicaly, she wanted to get me something I would really enjoy and continue enjoying.

I am a collector/hoarder of games, so whatever happens to the future of the game I will always own it and always play it (baring accidental damage) so she sees this as a longterm investment present...... Because of this, she asked me to place an order for as much of the content as I could in uk stocks right now.

When it all arrives, the only things I will be missing are: No deluxe at all, 1 Adventure pack, 4 Nightmare packs, 1 POD.

Thats one heck of a card hall. Yup especially for newbie.

Much excitement :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I will keep posting reports. My next game will be the lore/leadership against Hunt For Gollum. Depending on how that goes will affect if I tweak deck and have many replays trying to beat it, or if I decide to open up Carrock and get slaughtered  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] All good fun :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

From 20th March, so more like just over 6 weeks....... but still quick huh. Also, most of it is going into hiding until my Birthday in June.

Watched a pack on my wishlist go out of stock overnight and didnt want to wait until birthday to find more out of stock, so bought em now.

Getting fog on the barrow downs wont be easy though unless i pay over the odds from USA.

I usually order PoD stuff from FFG and it's not that expensive. Customs triggered only above a certain value threshold (usually 40 EUR), and shipping fees are proportional to the weight of the item. So, it shouldn't be too harsh on you if you get a couple of PoD

## 66 [alexbobspoons on May 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1610921)

Thanks, postage for small number of packs seems steep, while very good for larger numbers... which is sadly when customs hits. I probably will ffg them though.

Had the next hunt for gollum but with lore/leadership this time. I won, though it felt longer/harder yet finished with no damage on heroes.

Eowyns questing was replaced with Berevor plus allies. While Gimilis attack was replaced with Gloin plus Dunedain mark plus allies.

So the main difference was a LOT more allies, which really took off once Faramir was in play (last round with Gandalf also questing was an all-in for over 20-odd wp).

Things I missed most were the location-assist allies of Spirit and the threat reduction of spirit (ending threat was 40-odd before last-round gandalf reduced it).

A good win.

I did have a dodgy time towards the end of phase 2 when I lost my only clue and was trying not to progress to phase 3 (only to instantly reset to phase 2) while at the same time trying not to raise threat.. while waiting for another clue...tense.

I think one more play at hunt for gollum with this deck before i go back to my tri sphere and open Carrock :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I just placed a pod order.

1 saga nm, 3 normal nm and a pod scenario.

 

The equivalent packs bought in this country would have been £37.50 if available

From ffg with international shipping it is worked out as £54

So £16.50 extra

Feels steep though if you divide it between packs its not too bad. If customs sting me, then it will have been very expensive.

 

Its a shame that some pod are apparently not brought in by uk distributers (I emailed and asked)

Well an epic epic game of hunt for gollum using leadership/lore

I did win, but it was really drawn out.

Early on I got bogged down with locations as well as having a few surge-frenzies. Took most of my game to get past stage1.

First time Ive had the reset back to stage2 happen as well and that was more than once.

Lost clues back into the deck.

Went through my entire deck.

Went through the encounter deck twice and was into the third go of encounter deck.

By the end I had a complete army of allies.

Really had some judgement moments keeping questing low in stage2 after i lost a clue and needed another before stage3.

I played all 3 gandalfs during the course of the game, but also 2 sneak attack Gandalfs, so kinda 5 Gandalfs, 4 of which were used to lower threat, so a full 20 threat lowered and yet the winning turn threat was at 48 so really close call.

Very long/epic game.

With the encounter deck reshuffles, youve no idea how many times i killed those **** crows due to their card mechanic putting them back in the deck.... ive no idea myself how many times i engaged them.

No heros lost. Fun game.

Next game will be Carrock :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 69 [alexbobspoons on May 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1614520)

Two games at Carrock with Trisphere :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Game 1....smashed, took me appart. Those Much Adders came in early and Gimli was the only one who could defend without damage, but another card as shadow added +1 so Gimli went followed by the others. What damaging creatures they are.

 

Game 2...Success! All the cards came right. No Muck Adders as enemies. Got Gimli+Dwarven Axe+Plate Mail+ lotsa damage early so he was hitting for about 11/12 ish yeah! Added to Beorn ally they were hitting for lots. Faramir helped with questing to keep threat under control and two lots of Gandalf reduced the threat right down so that I could choose to engage trolls one at a time in stage 2. After only one turn of Beorn defending I got the objective ally at 8-resource and so he was defending trolls for free, and so one at a time gimli/beorn killed them while objective-ally was defending.

EDIT:oh and I even had an extra troll, hill troll, in staging as well as the uniques. Gandalf had soaked his hit though and he went down under Gimli/Beorn.

 

Pretty much went clockwork yay!

 

Fun games

:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Edit: I think keys to the success were:

High damage hitters (Gimli/Gloin) taking yrolls out in 1 turn

Getting the objective ally in to defend (Theodred generating the resource)

Reducing threat a LOT to keep trolls in staging and take them one at a time.

Eowyn/Faramir/generic-allies questing high to stop threat-increase. Even with all trolls in staging.

Those I think were my key aspects.

Another good strategy is to "turtle" your way through stage 1 -- use Denethor and/or Henamarth Riversong to scry the encounter deck so you know what's coming, and do your best to have your will match the threat in staging. By staying on stage 1 as long as possible (and reducing your threat as low as you can), you can raise a huge army of cannon-fodder and extra attackers along with Grimbeorn before you head to stage 2. I have seldom lost with that (cowardly) strategy… but some games have lasted more than 25 rounds! :-)

 

Anyway, congrats on your first victory vs. the Carrock… :-)

4 more goes at Carrock

First two with my tri sphere, both wins though one was close.

Then third was lore/leadership and i got bashed. Simply outclassed.

Fourth was trisphere again and i got beat. I was doing really well then first step of stage 2 i got the card that raises threat by all cards in staging. Bust the 34 and all trolls engaged.

I had gimli up high as well as grimbeorn and beorn and was holding my own not too badly but the 3 threat increase per-troll attack bust the 50 limit before I could stop it.

Next stop Rhogosbel

Having glanced at it, the number of eagles/ranged/healing required means a total deck redesign... so cant play it just yet, need to think about the deck first :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Oh gosh, I remember Rhosgobel! Haven't played that one in ages! Yes, load your deck with as much healing as you can(lore of imladris most importantly) and plenty of card draw to dig it out! Lore is a must in this quest! Rhosgobel is similar to Carroll in that you have to figure out the right speed to quest as you are playing. Rhosgobel is one of the most hated quests by some and others really like it! I believe GrandSpleen has Rhosgobel as one of his very favorites. Anyhow, good luck and looking forward to seeing how you fare against saving the eagle in Mirkwood forest!

Thank you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

My current deck is high on questing but low on healing and although very hard hitting in combat, i think none of it is ramged. So it really really does look like a full new deck construct.

I really need to think about this one.

Im thinking if swapping Gimli for Legolas, swapping some basic allies for eagles, then getting in more healing.

At the moment my healing is nimrodels via spirit-eowyn. So if i want more healing i have to pull in lore, which means dropping eowyn or theodred.

While I love celebrians stone, sneak attack and steward of gondor, i think eowyns questing, spirits threat reduction and location management might be more key, so i think theodred may sit out.

Radagast added of course.

Slightly worried that with gimli gone i wont have a huge hitter or automatic damage soak, but will see how that goes before tweaking.

Need to spread out the cards and do some choosing, but as the deck will be so different, i need to write down my current deck first as it is a favourite now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Keep in mind that Daughter of the Nimrodel can only heal heroes, not allies (so Wilyador can't benefit from her power).

Rhosgobel is a quest that demands a specialized deck build and not just for healing. I didn't hate the quest, but I didn't care for it much because of the required total rebuild.

> Keep in mind that Daughter of the Nimrodel can only heal heroes, not allies (so Wilyador can't benefit from her power).

Thats a very good point. Ill need to go through all my cards for this quest im sure.

The included radagahst card looks nice for healing if somewhat slow, but better than nothing.

Getting all the athelas out of the deck seems a key thing too.

## 77 [alexbobspoons on May 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1624757)

So five games at rhosgobel. Beaten every time.

First three were leadership/lore/tactics.. just could not quest enough. Badly beaten in stage 1 all times.

Second two games swapped out leadership for spirit. Did much better but still lost.

Think i may give another couple of goes with this deck before changing.

Though Denethor unable to defend against airbourne made him less useful. Maybe berevors card draw would get me radagast out quicker.

Also, other than healing, lore didnt do much these games yet. Thinking of including the song to get lore icon and just have lore healing, then either trisphere with remaining three or go spirit+2xtactics to get more tactics resource.

Not sure yet.

Another few games with same deck first so i can fully appreciate where I think it may be lacking.

I am finding this quest much harder than hunt/gollum or carrock so far. Fun though.

Stay tuned..

Edit: oh and one game i might have won if eowyn didnt die. Theres some nasty damage treacheries in there this deck

Have you been using his encounter deck manipulation ability? Denethor has always been part of my successful straight solo progression decks vs. Rhosgobel.

Used it a bit yes, though if Eowyn is questing and no allies out yes, then he tended to be saved for defense (even though cant if airbourne) and thus only use his ability if no defense used (or exhaust to gain athelas) so it didnt get used as much as i would have thought.

Heres a query, does radagasts ability count as a straight action... or is it a card effect thus making him a discard if he heals wilyador even once?

Thanks

I believe it counts as a card effect, so he would be discarded even if he only heals Wilyador once… at least, that's the way I played it.

It's an effect. It is on a card. Ergo it is a card effect. So yes, he gets discarded.

Eoywn, Bilbo, Denethor is a very good hero group against Rhosgobel. I lost continuously against this quest and I finally built a Eoywn, Bilbo, Denethor deck and I won 9/10 games. Just an option in case you get super stuck!

Thanks for all the comments :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think my deck has too much offensive in it at the moment (worries against airbourne enemies) which is reducing draw against other cards.

Want to have another couple of goes before tweaking again.

The bird lives!! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So a good few game sessions this afternoon. First 2 (maybe 3) were repeat losses at this scenario. Still finding it difficult. So for my last game i decided to deck redesign because i seemed to be holding cards without playing them so far.

So, i wondered what to replace. I needed tactics otherwise i had almost no attack/defense against airborne. I also wanted to keep the healing of lore and eowyns questing and card-countering, but i found i felt i missed key leadership cards like steward of gondor, celebrians stone etc.

So I kept lore and spirit too (with eowyn) and for leadership i included three copies of the song card plus three minstrels to pull them out. Then the sprinkle of leadership cards and i slimmed down some unused cards to make space.

Lastly, with denethor unable to defend against flying, i ditched him for berevor.

It went smooth as silk. Eowyn questing left berevor able to card draw and fairly soon i had the leadership song on eowyn as well as steward of gondor and celebrians stone. So eowyn was questing for loads, getting lots of resource and playing spirit and leadership with those resource.

Berevor kept card draw which meant i pulled all three of the lore healing cards so once i was in phase 2 i was almost waiting for bird to get 6 damage before dialing it back to 1 with a lore heal.

Once i managed to get an athelas (needed to complete game) by shoving gandalf onto its guard (dol guldur beastmaster) it was a big push to the finish over two turns, questing like mad. The penultimate turn played my third lore heal which dropped the birds damage back and the last turn i got final questing points with 3 damage on bird, with one athelas meaning a win yay!

Very pleased to beat it after so many tries and happy it was my own deck design too rather than a borrowed one.

While i can now move onto the next scenario, i think i will try a couple more times first with this deck just to see if i can beat it again first :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Another two games with same scenario and deck.

Game 1 another win, so this deck is good for this adventure :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] played out very similar to my other success and included kicking chieftan uftacks butt. Was engaged with ungoliant spawn at the end but completed the game before that fully resolved.

Game 2 i got beaten.

Early on i got the treachery that discards all...ALL.. events from your hand and i wad holding two of the three lore-heal cards aaarrgghh!!

I still made a good fight of it with this deck but not one single athelas turned up so bird died during stage 2.

Very happy with my deck solution. Now ive found it, i cant decide if to enjoy some more rhogosbel for a bit or move on to next scenario.... decisions :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

At the moment, dont really have the extra space for two handed and never certain if i have time for a full game so two handed is less of a priority right now. I like the idea of getting all this fun out of the game single handed and then at a later date being able to go right back to the start and see everything again but different via two handed :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ive heard that yes, but also seen somebody say its a favourite due to the epic journey feel of it too. So im actually looking forward to it as something different.... and considering how long it took me to refine a deck to beat rhosgobel a little bland light adventuring is welcome.

I do like the fact this game covers light hearted blandness as well as hardcore as it caters to all moods :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

There is some really beautiful art on the many location cards in Hills of Emyn Muil, which enhances the "journey" feel. I like to hike/trek in the wilderness IRL, so I find HoEM to be, for the most part, a pleasant, relaxing jaunt in Middle-Earth. A nice change of pace from the intensity of most quests.

Yes Emyn Muil has really cool art!  Unfortunately, for solo it is rather easy but every once and a while it can trip you up! Personally, I wouldn't spend a whole lot of time on Emyn Muil because it is very repetitive and just a few plays will give you almost the full experience of that quest.   However, the last two quests in the Mirkwood cycle are my favorites so looking forward to you facing those! (especially Return to Mirkwood!)

Yes, Emyn Muil is good the first couple of times, but it feels pretty much the same every time after that.

Emyn Muil has gotten more hate than any other quest ever. I think it also has to do with the player cards, which were not that great. Personally, I didn't find it that bad. Khamul said the next two were great quests. I'm sorry, but I think the Dead Marshes is a horrible quest. It is my pick for the easiest quest in the game. I can bear it on turn 4 or 5 every game and even the nightmare version is easy. Talk about repetitive, you basically quest, and then quest again. Then, if you are unlucky or bad enough to lose Gollum the quest becomes super lame as you are literally just sitting around and waiting for him to come out again. I don't get it. Why do people hate on Emyn Muil but nobody seems to remark on how terrible Dead Marshes is, much worse and more boring quest. IMHO

I am almost ashamed to admit that I lost a few times to Hills of Emyn Muil (straight solo) as a result of not drawing/being able to put into play certain cards that arguably were critical to victory… I won't name the cards in order to not spoil the quest for alexbobspoons. 

 

The only quest I have never ever lost to in straight solo or 2-handed (so far!) is The Dead Marshes. I'm afraid to play it again for fear that I may lose my perfect record! Still, I enjoyed TDM. It apparently doesn't take much to please me.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Dead Marshes actually requires some strategic decisions on how much willpower you send on the quest and how much you hold back for escape tests. Emyn Muil you just dump a ton on the quest, but most of it goes to waste anyway. If there's combat, it's easy. Rinse and repeat for far too long, just doing the same thing over and over. I'll grant you it doesn't have anything as bad as the possibility of losing gollum in TDM.

Also, you think Dead Marshes is easier than Passage through Mirkwood or Hunt for Gollum?

I do think Dead Marshes is a weak quest because of how easy and quick it is. But I think the hate towards Emyn Muil vs. Dead Marshes may have to do with how the former can drag on while the latter is almost always over in a flash. Much better to watch a boring 5-minute video than a boring 2-hour movie!

Yes, Dead Marshes is easier than Passage and Hunt for Gollum. The "strategy" it takes is very minimal. It is true, however, that the fact it is so easy and quick does improve it's playability. I have been known to try a new deck on it just to smash something.

Well the strategy that Emyn Muil takes is pretty much non-existent.

See, when I'm trying a new deck and want to smash something I choose Hunt for Gollum...

One go at emyn muil with trisphere. Easy win.

It was fun and i can see where its epic-journey reputation comes from and i did indeed enjoy it, though i do imagine its hard to lose with a constructed deck containing good willpower and location management.

That said, the game needs scenarios like this where you can enjoy the game and expect to win. Some scenarios can be so hard at first that after repeated losses, it may be nice to rake a break, throw your deck against emyn muil for some light heartedness then come back to the difficulty.

So i enjoyed it, not much challenge, will play a few times more before going onto Dead Marshes.

I can see this being a go-to scenario for light heartedness and easy-win.

Fun though and lovely location art

Ok ok i officially withdraw my previous comments. Today i played another emyn muil and it kicked my arse!

I drew two lots if dol guldur orcs, so that was two lots of 2 damage to questing heroes followed by a necromancers reach doing another 1 damage to all heroes who were questing at the time, so gimli and theodred both had 3 wounds and eowyn 1. Then i pulled a treachery card that did two damage to each hero (cant remember the card) so all three died same turn.

I didnt have any cards to counter and had hit location-lock at almost turn 1 hence trying to quest with so many heroes. It just butchered me with treachery.

So depending on card draw, nit as easy as first appears. Few more games at this scenario are in order now I feel :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Three goes at emyn muil today.

Go one it hammered me again. Man those treacheries can be rough.

Go two, everything was going well, looked a good win... then rockslide killed eowyn and theodred in one go. After that Gimli couldnt handle it on his own and it was location lock and threat bust to another loss.

Go three, i won easy. A no problem jaunt to victory.

Does seem the treacheries in this scenario can be game breakers.

## 104 [DukeWellington on May 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1642666)

I agree. It's one reason I don't hate on the quest like everyone else. I recommend working in some sky effect (looking at top of encounter deck) Riversong helps save you from landslide. I also like ears to the ground or whatever or Denethor.

## 105 [alexbobspoons on May 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1642940)

Good idea. My trisphere doesnt have lore, but i dont think i need the full might of tactics, so may swap tactics for lore (denethor) and upgrade theodred to aragorn or gloin to still have combat ability.

Hmm ill have a think on that thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 106 [alexbobspoons on June 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1647612)

So Emyn Muil beat me again. I was going amazing then those treacheries nuked me. Its always the treacheries. Theres not enough treachery cancellation in my spirit deck to handle the amount, so skrying has to be the best repeatable solution. Henamarth being only 1 card is unreliable so it has to be denethor/lore.

So what to drop?

Eowyn/Spirit is a must to keep.

Leadership is good for Faramir, steward/gondor, celebrians etc.

Tactics is only good for the few fights.

So ill probably drop tactics. In doing so, i need a hard hitter for combat, so probably swap theodred for Aragorn and bolster Aragorn with a few additional Leadership allies.

Didnt want to design a deck specially for this scenario but i think ive lost enough that a deck design is needed before i move on.

Slightly wondering if to keep tactics and get the leadership cards via a leadership-song card, but first I think ill try the aragorn route.

Aragorn was my favorite when I started out. Don't remember using many tactics cards, aside from my first few tries, not until the dwarfs and super heroes cycle... often ran Aragorn, Theodred, Eowyn together; using Signal's, Unexpected Courage, Celebrían's Stone etc to boost Aragorn... Theodred to help with resources early on... Steward & Celebrian's on Aragorn to pay for expensive spirit Allies...

Aragorn/Eowyn/Denethor is a great combo. I used to play it all the time back in the core set days.

So went Aragirn, Denethor, Eowyn and made a deck to go with them.

Played and won three Emyn Muils in a row :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Skrying certainly wins this.

Even when i got location lock, i was able to pull it back with this deck at one point (Thank you sudden appearance of Northern Tracker).

So next game will be my first at Dead Marshes. Going to keep the same deck, see how it plays and where its downsides are (considering the core encounter decks used, i am thinking i will be lacking combat, but lets play and see).

After playing, then I will deck design fir this one.

If you're fortunate enough to get two or more Northern Trackers in play at the same time (plus do timely drops with Snowbourn Scouts, even with Sneak Attack if necessary), you can clear the location locks in Emyn Muil fairly quickly (if you aren't first eliminated by threat gain).

So five goes at Dead Marshes today with the same deck as enyn muil. 4 wins 1 loss.

The loss was due to getting tied up with a hill troll too much to a threat bust. I did have it sorted by having an extra defense on denethor meaning he could defend the troll and take 2 damage without dying, then be healed by a nimrodel, great even though i could only scratch 1 or 2 damage on it per turn.. then the giant marsh worm joined the troll and it all went bad.

The other 4 games, the wins, were good. Aragorn being able to quest and hide test is good. Getting unexpected courage onto eowyn works great for that too!

While they were consistent wins they didnt feel easy as the choice on quest/hide was difficult at times and even scrying could only help so much. So still challenging.

Next i am on to Return to Mirkwood. Ive had a peek and woah it looks hard.

Im going to try same deck at first, expect to lose as i dont think i have near enough combat for those attercops.

After a few losses I think i will deck design with Gimli. Maybe use songs to go quad-sphere.

If you try to fight the attercops or any of the big enemies you will almost always lose the quest. In solo, most of the time your only hope is to just rush through and quest as fast as you can before your threat runs out, while holding of any enemies with fient or chump blockers ect. Will be very interesting to hear your experiences!

I noticed that as a solo player the attercop will instantly engage me, as well as undefended damage going onto Gollum, so I was thinking to get Gimli citadel plate and dwarvern axe and go nuclear on them. That said, my current deck doesnt have Gimli and ill play it a few times with that first to see how the encounter plays and beats me.

Hmm

8 Goes at this today, all losses.

Every single loss was due to threat bust. As a solo player raising by 4 every turn is destroying, especially with treacheries raising 8 threat.

With such fast threat raise, even having 2 galadrims greetings, 3 gandalfs and 2 sneak attacks doesnt card draw enough to reduce threat enough, especially as cards cant be played at all in stage 3. Too much threat raise.

Lots of reliance on luck with card draw.

One game I lost on last stage when busting threat.

One game I thought i had it in the bag. Last quest phase was complete but still Attercop in play. My threat was 48 or 49 so needed to win this round. Dropped in Gandalf, did his damage to the Attercop and him and buffed Aragorn were going to be enough to kill it and win the game yay, i even had a chump blocker ready. All good..... then the shadow card raised threat and bust 50 aarrgh!

So not beat it yet.

High fast questing with threat reduction seems the key, but my deck already has that. So im thinking card draw to get through the deck, which means Berevor (hate to loose scrying) and due to starting threat swap Aragorn for Theodred (risky as Aragorns ready skill is useful here). Might try that.

Also might ditch leadership and ho eowyn berevor denethor. The lore scout that ignores enemy defense would be good against enemies and denethor scrying, berevor card draw and eowyn questing. Maybe a song to be able to include celebrians stone, steward/gondor and sneak attack. Not sure yet.

Might go a few more with the deck as-is considering ive gad two nearly wins.

Man that threat increase is tough as solo.

EDIT:

Another three games

First TWO both wins yay.

Basically the deck ran ok, not exceptional but good enough... but the encounter deck was so kind and so the scenarios just ran well (Gollums bite still nasty)

Third game was another threat bust.

I imagine the later heros who reset threat to zero are handy.

I think I might have won the third game too if I had been allowed to play Gandalf in stage 3 so he could threat reduce and quest high but sadly not allowed to play cards and thus threat bust with 5/7 progress on stage 3

Though fragile, Bilbo Baggins would be your most reliable card draw in the Core/Mirkood hero card pool… assuming you can protect or buff him up well enough. It's been a long time since I played this one, don't remember what Treacheries are in the deck.

Secondly, today spent lots of enjoyable time sleeving cards (yes i am now 40 this week so now own my huge £300+ collection present) which was great to see fleeting glimpses of awesome futre cards, both bad and good.

Then I played 1 game on my new 2-playet(awesome) printed plsymat from inkedplaymats and the playmat is stunning and the game was great.

Massing at Osgiliath was available at GenCon 2011, and thus released between the Core set and Hunt for Gollum (http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/181655/ffg-news-compilation-lord-rings-card-game [http://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/181655/ffg-news-compilation-lord-rings-card-game]), though not available to retail until some months later (likely, as you say, between Dead Marshes and Return to Mirkwood). So it was designed to be played with Core cards only.

 

I have a good win ratio vs. MaO using Core cards only, both straight solo and 2-handed. For what it's worth, it's definitely easier than Dol Guldur! :-)

Actually, based on what I found when I looked it up a while back, I believe they had copies of Conflict at the Carrock at GenCon as well as Massing, so people had those two APs plus the Core Set.

I had a go at Osgiliath.

Lost but fun!

I got right to the final stage before being killed by too much enemy engagement, two mounted scouts plus witch king (just killed a captain too)

I had no progress on that final stage and my threat was 48, so even if id survived its likely i couldnt quest fast enough.

Fun quest.

My deck didnt have enough offensive really. Feels like location control and offensive are key things here along with high questing. So i may have another play before i go to the deck design stage.

That witch king really hurts both in damage and threat!!

Ps: there were only two encounter cards left before needing a reshuffle too.

Pps: argh to get across the river you basically have to sacrifice a hero/objective-ally how harsh!!

Okay another 4 games at Osgiliath today.

Game one still same deck and same loss.

So i decided to deck switch and went back to my early days of gimli, eowyn and theodred to get some hard hitting into this.

So game two, I won :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] including killing the witch king (his card doesnt say he is invulnerable or anything) . It had worked a treat.

Game three and four both losses. One had me lacking a ranger so lost a hero getting over the river and then got overwhelmed, the other had me get some bad draw and so almost no allies so when the enemies swamped i couldnt defend enough.

At least I beat it once though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Id like to beat it one more time before moving on to kazad dum, so will play it some more first :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I earned three victories out of 6 games played with Eowyn, Denethor and Aragorn, when I first played this quest last fall.

## 133 [alexbobspoons on June 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1674118)

> I earned three victories out of 6 games played with Eowyn, Denethor and Aragorn, when I first played this quest last fall.

Those were my initial heroes for this quest and in my two losses i didnt feel i had enough offensive at the final stage or enough high questing to mske a dash for the finish line (Faramir had wandered off, otherwise the end sprint may have been possible). Denethors scrying was useful, though even when you use it to get rid of a card, the replacement was often just as bad.

With the gimli,theodred,eowyn deck i mainly lose denethors scrying and aragorns readying (dont think there were any key lore cards missed) so it seemed to work well. Building gimli up to combat-monster takes time but witch king isnt until stage 4 so thats ok. Also those wolf scouts are a pain, with attack 4 they can kill most allies/heroes then dissapear back into deck, they can also take a hit from most basic heroes/allies without dying, so being able to feint, then gimli one-hit them was a useful bonus from tactics too.

Fun quest, hard but fun (dol guldur so far remains the only quest I passed on without winning)

Another two losses but one seemed really close. Other didnt get past stage one due to massess of enemies building and engaging.

I do find it a hard quest.

Another one or two games before I move on. Next will be kazad dum. Im excited for those quests but nervous about the sudden influx of player cards from my first deluxe expansion. Chosing if to include new ap player cards is hard enough, so a deluxe will be a bit card-overload from what i have been used to so far.

But very much excited about the thought of kazad dum.

Couple more pops at osgiliath first.

## 135 [alexbobspoons on July 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1688538)

so i had another go at osgiliath and victory yay! Again involved Gimli being able to kill witch king, with help from gandalf.

So next will be starting on kazad dum, a whole new cycle awaits!!

Khazad Dum and the following cycle are amazing, looking forward to hearing about your experiences!

## 137 [alexbobspoons on July 12, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1689432)

First go at kazad dum quest 1 (into the pit I think) and a win.

It took me ages to quest past the gate, locations were building and enemies gathering (no engagement possibility) and it was getting harder to quest while also cards were removing quest progress. The spirit ranger ally that adds progress to staging area locations was the only reason I got staging-threat down enough to quest through the gate and then onto the other locations and through the stage.

The other stages seemed easier, one actually including discarding enemies seemed to easy.

Gandalf dropping in to help eowyn, faramir (ally) and other allies quest through the final phase in just one turn was good.

Pretty enjoyable quest with some interesting mechanics. Looking forward to a few more goes.

## 138 [alexbobspoons on July 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1696519)

another two games.

First was kazad dum 1 again (is it into the pit?)

Again a win, but again it was hard fought and the big difficulty was getting through stage 1. It seems so easy to fill up staging on that quest. This time I used the torch more to help but it was still a hard fought victory.

Second was my first go at Seventh Level. At difficulty level 3 I thought hey, cakewalk. But nope!! While I did indeed beat it, it was very hard fought, simply enemies filling up staging and engaging each turn, not big ones but too many.

I had gimli in combat monster mode and with unexpected courage so he could basically kill 2 every turn, but defending was hard. Theodred with plate took lots of hits but a daughter of nimrodel kept healing him too.

At the end I played two turns each with a gandalf to get me to victory.

it did seem a combat mess. Lots if fun though.

Also, i quite liked the book attachment. Said no exhaust to quest... but no attacking. So technically I believed you could quest without exhaust and then exhaust to defend (not an attack) so that made it quite useful (until we left it in the tomb).

Two fun wins.

Seventh level is one of my all time favorite quests. It is now a complete cakewalk for me, but still fun because of the swarming feel of the enemies.

## 140 [alexbobspoons on July 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1696841)

> Seventh level is one of my all time favorite quests. It is now a complete cakewalk for me, but still fun because of the swarming feel of the enemies.

Yes I can understabd that, those shadow cards that add the enemy to staging arrgh :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Even with gimli squashing two full enemies per turn they seemed to stack up faster in staging. My game on it went as far as an encounter deck reshuffle too.

It was fun, though a more ally-stacked specifically designed deck would be easier I think.

Oh yes, and not sure which of my two games this was but... that shadow card that says if its an ally defender duscard it... arrrrrrghhh I had JUST saved up resource for beorn and lost him on his first action, nooooooooo.... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] (I think it was into the pit)

Oh yes , thanks I did handle that right, if it wasnt for citadel plate I would have lost Theodred that round too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Another two seventh levels.

Go one.... battered. THey just swarmed from the word go and I was overwhelmed very quickly.

Go two, a win.

Harder fought this time as Gimli didnt get unexpected courage, but still a great fight fest to the end.

Next go will be my first at flight from Moria :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 144 [alexbobspoons on July 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1700764)

Two goes at flight from moria today.

Go 1 hammered. Card killed Theodred on turn two, few turns later a shadow card discarded defending faramir and then the resultant attack was undefended so Eowyn died. Few turns later with only Gimli left the threat cap bust.

Go 2 a win.

Basically managed to get the tools out, then kept bypassing quest cards until the one where you can dig out, once there, theodred with tools did nothing but exhaust tools for 4 turns while the others held ground (and Gandalf reduced the steeply climbing threat) so after four turns of tools the quest card was completed and scenario won.

My victory display was quite large by that point, so without Gandalfs threat reduction then threat would have bust before four turns of Theodred using tools.

It was fun, I very much liked the random quest deck. Victory on second go makes me feel it was easier than I expected and I dont think my deck was good for it, i think a deck with more allies would be better.

A couple more goes I think befote Dwarrowdelf

:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 145 [alexbobspoons on July 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1703744)

More goes.

2 at flight from moria, both close run losses.

Then I decided to deck redesign. Take out a lot of cards I didnt seem to be using and add lots of allies.

Go 1: first card out was tools, then guarded by that big troll. Ouch. Tried hard but lost.

Go 2: Another loss... close but lost. Seems my deck redesign so far isnt great.

Go 3 this morning: A win, yay (even with the big troll in staging)

My thoughts so far:

Dont complete quests unless you have to because it adds to victory display thus buffs up nameless fear.

Discard quests untill you get the fetch-tools quest and thus fetch tools.

Discard quests until you get the use tools to escape quest. Once you have that, dedicate a hero to just exhausting to use tools to escape (preferably with unexpected courage to use tools twice)

All the time, using your many allies to defend all those minions and Gimli to kill them.

Usual threat reduction via Gandalf of Galhadrims Greetings.

One more go, then win or lose I move onto Redhorn Gate (not sure which deck to use though)

## 146 [alexbobspoons on July 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1704130)

So I had two more goes.

One a loss, one a win. The win was good, the loss was difficult draws. Happy wuth my resultant deck.

So moved onto Redhorn Gate.

Been really looking firward to this one as I love snow settings for RPGs.

I got HAMMERED using same deck. Theodred died on turn-1 and it all went downhill from there.

That Snow warg that can only be defended by heroes but hits really hard, wow what a difficult card. No chump blocking, killed Gimli then Eowyn. All gone.

I know I need to deck redesign for this one now, but I didnt get enough flavour to know what I am aiming at so I need another go or two with thiscdeck before thinking what I need to change or design.

Love the theme of this scenario!!

## 147 [alexbobspoons on August 1, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1715127)

Ok

So I had another experiment go at this yesterday, and did pretty well. Got part way through Caradras during final stage, but due to its effect of reducing wp by 1 and quest effect of any heros dying if they hit wp0 i only had eowyn and arwen who could quest... then i got the snow card that reduces questing cards wp by 1 thus arwen died, game over.

So i redesigned deck.

Less armaments and such for gimli, less tactic allies. More wp and questing allies and wp based cards. Gimlis axe changed to blade of gondolin, as i dont need weapons extra hit, but progress on cards is needed.

So yesterday I played a game, went ok but a loss, some bad draws.

Today, two games.

Game 1 loss. Too many enemies too early meant overwhelmed and dead heroes.

Game two, success!!

It felt pretty hard fought, but went as per my deck plan. Lots of questing, favour of lorien, dunedain +1wp, celebrians stone, northern tracker, faramir. Citadel plate on gimli, nimrodel healing.

Lost theodred late in the game, but pushed through to victory.

Hard fought, fun and felt really deserving of victory.

I do think this scenario is tough for me but fun. So I think a few more plays with this deck before any considerations of moving onwards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks Julia, and you were quite key in originally steering me towards this game so thank you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So over 4 months in and many plays, yet still so early in my progression. Many APs, deluxes, pods, all the sagas and NM quests all still to go at. I am on my 14th different quest so at this rate, lots of time to go before I even start to think about redoing quests :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Missed out a play.

Last weekend, another go at redhorn and a win, yay. Hard fought again but went to plan.

## 154 [alexbobspoons on August 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1748492)

Just to keep up to my online record, another Redhorn Gate today and spectacular loss. Location lock from almost turn 1, then an orc got buffed by a shadow card to take out Theodred before I had allies into play, followed by a snow warg which had to be defended by gimli, but due to its shadow card it also killed gimli, so then snow warg killing eowyn was unavoidable.

Ouch.

Anyways, on the Road to Rivindell now.

I was happy with my finalised deck against Redhorn, but do find it to be quite a hard encounter for me.

Lets see how the road pans out next time I play.

## 155 [Julia on August 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1748514)

> I was happy with my finalised deck against Redhorn, but do find it to be quite a hard encounter for me.

 

I haven't ventured that far into Dwarrowdelf / Khazad-dum (7x Into the Pit, 1 each 7th level / FLight from Moria / Redhorn / Rivendell), but I had the impression that quests become longer and generally "more complex" to handle than in the previous AP cycle.

Yes it did seem longer, mainly due to victory conditions as well as questing, having to dig out the additional victory point locations from the encounter deck takes time.

For me, i think the difficult aspects were:

1: Snow warg not defended by allies. This killed a lot of heroes. Solution being a healer (didnt always draw) or maybe i shouldve swapped in a good defender like Denethor. Cards such as feint worked well too but not always drawn.

2: Location lock. Lots of high threat locations could creep in. Silution northern tracker and snowborn scout, but didnt always draw.

3: Questing. The lowering of wp in stage three can be hard. Buffing up eowyn by all the usual wp methods seemed best.

4: That warg that jumps back to staging if no shadow effect. So many times did this do damage then jump back before I hit it. My deck just doesnt have any contents to damage staging, so thats a weakness, though the next ap (just git ready for next gane/scenario) contained a nice little tactics card for that, so maybe next scenario will tackle that warg better.

So I did think there were quite a few difficult aspects to Redhorn, but if card draw worked, solutions worked quite well.

Not generally an easy one for me, but I beat it enough to be happy to move on now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 157 [Julia on August 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1749005)

I totally see the darn warg with no shadows moving back to staging after resolving the attack. It's... tedious. Technically, you can deal with it with Swift Strike (2 damages done upon declaring defending character) possibly paired up with a Gondorian Spearman as defender so that you instantly kill the beast as he tries to attack you, but agreed, it's not said you have the cards available (in your hand / in the deck). Another solution could be direct damage into the staging area (Dunhere for instance). Depends on how your deck is built. But agreed, if you don't have any of these (or similar) solutions available, is a total pain in the (staging) area...

## 158 [alexbobspoons on August 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1749529)

So three gors at Road to Rivindell today.

Go1

Success

Pretty easy, went amazing and left me thinking is it really that easy after redhorn gate and with no deck tweak.

Go2

Loss

Hard fought. Wargs game me trouble and the birdys stopping cancels were problrmatic. Ended up too much enemy engagement to defend and attack.

Go3

Huh!!!

I was doing pretty well and then shadow effect of "sleeping sentry" killed every hero and ally in one card reveal thus end of game. Wft!!! Ridiculously powerfull shadow card (see my post in rules section) seemed daft my entire play area was discarded in one card turn. Without shadow cancelling or scrying this is just so defeating.

Anyways, 1 win 2 loss do far.

## 159 [alexbobspoons on August 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1750477)

So i tweaked my deck to contain a full 3 hasty strokes to cancel shadow cards and decided to mulligan if starting hand doesnt feature them.

Go1:

Going really well.. then i draw the nasty bird which surges into another nasty bird which surges into a goblin, eek.

Those birdies stop my hasty stroke so need to get rid of them.. goblin engages and i selectively engage a birdy. Wouldnt you know it, i draw the nasty shadow card and am not allowed to play my cancel card so Arwen and others dead game over again.

Go2:

Hard fought victory. Ending threat 43 so didnt have much time left. Deck worked as designed though so was happy.

## 160 [alexbobspoons on August 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1750567)

Another go, a win again.

That lazy sentry still managed to cause the death of eowyn but I had two gandalfs and a sneak attack plus plenty resource so next three turns still quested well with gandalfs. Without those, eowyn going may have sunk the ship.

Enjoying this scenario lots. Every time is a challenge but now ive tweaked my deck its still comfortably beatable, so this scenario/deck combo feels well balanced now and the outcome is more on the play of the cards (plus luck)

Dont want to move on from this scenario yet, possibly my favourite since hunt for gollum (which i really enjoyed)

## 161 [alexbobspoons on August 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1761581)

So two games today.

Game1 Rivendell again, lost on last turn. I had everything lined up to quest my last points next turn and a shadow card killed Arwen, whoops.

Moved on to Watcher in the Water. Wow thats hard without a dedicated deck.

Difficult combat and I bust threat.

Need to have another play before deciding on a deck build but right now im thinking lots of tactics combat, plus lore healing, plus spirit threat reduction and questing. Celebrians stone, steward gondor, sneak attack would all be nice too so may need to splash those in, so if i go for this build it will be my first non-splashed Lore build since core-set.

Another defeat with current deck then some deck designing :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

That's so weird. When I lose, I always seem to lose on the last turn too (at least when I'm playing solo). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

> That's so weird. When I lose, I always seem to lose on the last turn too (at least when I'm playing solo). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hehe you know what I meant though ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I only needed about 3 more points on the quest and at that point was questing for about 12 or 13 so next round was pretty much sorted. The enemy was only a goblin spearman too. In retrospect, I didnt need Arwens extra wp or resource gen at that point so if i hadnt exhausted her, Id have won next go. Silly mistake.

:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 164 [alexbobspoons on August 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1763061)

Ok so I played my next game on watcher and got smashed, so decided to deck design.

I made the decision that questing didnt seem as crucial here, so shock horror for the first time I benched Eowyn.

I went Gimli (attack), Gloin (cheap leadership with WP and resource) and Denethor (defense mainly).

Tactics i stacked for combat and allies. Mainly boosting gimli. Lore i went for healing and forest snares, Leadership I went for buffs like celebrians stone, steward gondor as well as sneak attacks and some chump block allies. I then added a couple of songs to splash spirit with an unexpected courage and three galadhrims greetings.

I then played a game.

To be honest, it didnt actually go as smooth as i had hoped and felt disasterous at first, but then it pulled back a bit and although I did still lose, it felt like I had done ok. I lost in second/final phase with six damage on the watcher who was also forest snared, so it felt like i had time to resolve things, BUT Gimli had not gained any buffing, no armour, no weapons, so doing enough damage to the watcher was going to be difficult with his regen, so i played for time hoping to buff Gimli but in the process got overwhelmed with normal enemies and lost the game.

I think if I had got the watcher snared quicker, i wouldnt have lost as many chumps and then they would have handled the normal enemies, but thats the way the draw went.

So it was a loss, but ended well even if started slowly.

I am not yet sure if this deck will work ok. I fear I could get some location lock due to losing eowyn, northern tracker and lorien guide, just not sure yet. Part of me thinks benching leadership could be wiser than benching spirit. I really cannot think my head around a mono or dual sphere for this so sticking with tri plus splash.

So I think another go or two to decide if the deck works, needs tweaking, or a redesign.

Will see how it goes.

Difficult quest for me this one so far.

The key to the quest is to skry heavily and see what is coming so you can plan properly. Also, the son of a nor or whatever, the Dunedain that pulls an enemy, can be used on the watcher to bring him down and snare him. It is a quest that is hard until you Crack it, then it's super easy. It is a fun quest though.

Every time I beat Watcher in the Water was by racing through the Gates of Durin without killing the Watcher. Denethor/Unexpected Courage and other scrying cards are very helpful for that!

I had another go today, had the watcher snared but was waiting for citadel plate to come out of my deck to buff Gimli to kill it, waited too long and ended up overwhelmed by tentacles. Felt like I didnt do too badly though, if Gimli had been buffed I think I might have got it.

Scrying to beat the door/gate spell... didnt think of that! Must make that aspect so easy wow. Skry to see the letter of the card and discard to suit. Wow easy solution.

Next go I will see how I am doing by stage two before deciding if Gimli can kill watcher or if to skry for victory, cheers.

> I was wondering why you were so determined to kill the Watcher. I have never bothered to try. :-)

Because i hadnt thought of scrying to get through the doors until you mentioned it and without scrying had thought the doors would take forever, so designed my deck with an aim to kill the watcher instead. So as I dont plan to change the deck, if I get to stage 2 and Gimli is buffed up and I have forest snare in hand, then just to use the deck as-designed i will kill the watcher rather than scrying :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I have a slight worry that the scrying idea has instantly turned a very hard challenging quest into a very easy one. The scrying seems so obvious now.

Another newbie here. Originally I played the first LotR ccg ME:TW if anyone remembers, which was quite alike this one. As I loved that one I jumped right into this :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] A core box later I´m trying out the various decks against the Mirkwood quest. I only pity that the game doesn´t have a tournament scene as I like travelling somewhere and meeting fellow enthusiasts to a good game!

## 172 [alexbobspoons on September 1, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1767407)

Thanks for your post Scactha and welcome to possibly my favourite game in many many years, it truly is excellent.

 

I myself am playing progressive, using only the cards for each scenario/adventure that were available at the time as well as going through in order of release/publication, so I imagine this thread gives quite a newbie perspective from my first days of passage through mirkwood with zero deckbuilding skills, to my present point part-way through Dwarrowdelf (still with no deck building skills haha!)

 

I would say that if you do not want spoilers, or my own solutions to how I tackled quests, then only read up to your last quest, but if you want ideas for quests then do feel free to read on. It now feels like a bit of a diary of my journey which is why I keep updating it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

My first couple of posts have my take on the mirkwood quest with core decks, though I would say do not worry about losing. The initial core decks tend to be very weak until you start combining them into dual-sphere or tri-sphere and then they get stronger still when your card pool expands. But at first with core-only premade decks, they really are weak and certainly most people get smashed to bits once they try "Journey Down The Anduin" and tend not to even get a few turns into "Escape From Dol Guldur" as it is so so so hard with core decks especially solo.

 

I myself found the Mirkwood-Cycle adventures that followed through the adventure packs of the first cycle were better balanced quests than in the core set, so if you get beat a lot, do not be discouraged :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

There are some great guides on websites out there too.

 

Great to have you in the game and best of luck with your questing. Hope you enjoy it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Cheers

Alex

## 173 [Scactha on September 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1771161)

So, some old friends and I tested it again yesterday. We´ve played games for 20+ years together. We played the started decks; Tactics, Lore and Leadership blowing through Mirkwood. Next we took on the banks of Anduin and quested cautiously resulting in us being swamped in Trolls and other nasties. We reset and switched Lore for Spirit. This time it worked well and we blew the stages 1 and 2, but at the 3rd we got a massive surge of shadow cards leaving us bruised and unable to quest well enough to keep Threat at bay. With one round available before succumbing to threat to solve it the Leadership deck whizzed out Gandalf who nuked the last troll for it´s final HP! *phew*

 

Observations:

 * More players scaled to the detriment of the Shadow. One more card drawn vs the versatility of the three extra heroes and their deck didn´t match well.
 * Tactics was fun. Especially Legolas! Weedy goblin shows: Legolas pre emptive strikes before they attack and we get Progress to boot? Loved it and want to play a Silvan theme now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
 * Spirit is neat in controlling engnagements. Better Dodge whoever you don´t want to fight atm. Like that too.
 * Leadership felt like the "bank". "Anyone need Resources?"
 * There are a million ways to strategize out of the Core set. Our main problem was deciding who would get to do something that someone else could handle. Best economy rules. Good design by FFG.
 * The lack of comptitive aspect... That´s a pity since the drama the game captures is a tad diluted as no one wins or loses really.

If you have Khazad-dum you can add Narvi's belt to Gloin, with his damage=resources he can give jumpstart, or even be nice resource generator, provided with healing.

I decided against Jarvis belt as it costs 2 leadership resource while the song of travel costs 1 neutral and its mainly spirit I needed.

Anyways

1 game today.... disaster.

Setup I draw a tentacle (4 attack) and turn 1 I draw a treachery. But as the tentacle attacks, it's shadow card (warg) adds +1attack so it is attacking for 5 and it has an effect saying discard an encounter card etc which results in the attack being undefended.

So, turn 1 I do not have the cards or resource to stop this and I take an underfunded attack5 thus one hero dead on turn 1 nothing I can do about it.

After that it was just a downward spiral until threat bust. Couldn't attack/defend/quest with 2 hero's and zero allies, so questing slipped and threat bust.

Bad first turn/draw

Better luck next time.

In this whole game, I don't think there is any enemy more annoying than Thrashing Tentacle and Striking Tentacle.  Man, back in the day, those Tentacles made that quest so dang annoying and hard! 

## 177 [Noccus on September 6, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1777800)

Alex,

 

If you want to beat tWitW without scrying, it can be hard to if you are playing progressively. 

I suggest you use Boromir. Without a single attachment he hacks off most tentacles in a single blow.

Pair him with Spirit, as Galadrim's Greeting will be needed to keep readying Boromir.

Add Test of Will & Hasty Stroke, as they will come in very handy to counter any nasty effects.

The best option here is probably Frodo so you get to use Good meal on Galadrim's Greeting.

Using Frodo you can also make Frodo block and absorb the damage in threat.

 

The 3rd hero should be Lore if you have trouble taking too much damage.

This might sound odd, but Glorfindel is a good choice here (besisdes his high threat): he adds 3 quest, or 3 damage.

He can also heal using his resources, which is what you are looking for in the first place.

That, and he enables you to use Council of Elrond.

Furthermore, Lore gives you access to: Healing, Card Draw, Forest Snare, & Fast Hitch for Frodo.

But really, most Lore heroes aren't a bad choice here. So take your pick.

 

Hope that helps.

Good luck!

The point I made earlier about skry in was intended to apply even if you want to kill the watcher. If you can use skry g to see what shadow cards are coming the tentacles become far easier to deal with properly.

Well five games today.

First two on same deck, both lossess in similar fashion.

I decided i wasnt being able to quest enough as celebrians stone and faramir kept hiding in the deck, so i swapped out gloin/leadership for eowyn/spirit and swapped my song splash of spirit for leadership.

Go 3 (with new deck) the usual tentacle debacle happens and Denethor dead on turn two with nothing i could do about it.

Go 4 went ok but a real struggle all the way until threat bust.

Go 5 beat it. One of those where everything ran to deck-plan (though my discard to get through the door had to be Gandalf)

So thats it, really found this one a hard quest and now am moving on. Next game will be a new scenario.

Thanks for all the detailed advices. Cheers!

Lol thank you for your kind words and you keep enjoying too!!

 

I have got to the point that this thread is too complete for me to have any games without logging them here. Not really what the forum is for as FFG have the quest log (which I havent used) but I really like this thread being my online diary, development and journey through the game proggressively.

 

This weekend I will be leaving watcher in the water behind and moving on :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] so thats quite exciting for me :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So two games of Long Dark, both wins.

Game1 with previous deck. Won but had two cave trolls engaged which was really difficult but just managed it.

Then deck tweaked (no need for forest snares and needed extra spirit cancells)

Game2 won again with new deck and it went pretty clockwork. One scary moment was a really bad locate test which would have killed so many and removed so much progress, but i passed it with two cards still in hand then quested to victory next turn.

Its an ok scenario, locate mechanic is interesting, but I havent felt anything majorly wonderful about it. Not bad but fairly run of the mill.

The trolls or bad timed locate can be really bad but most other things look quite tame.

One or two more goes before moving on I think.

It boggles my mind that The Long Dark is rated "7" in difficulty, second only to Shadow and Flame in that cycle. I always thought it was the easiest quest in the Dwarrowdelf Cycle, and possibly the least interesting.

Totally agree. Even the nightmare is easy. Like Dead Marshes the quest is a joke. Boring and easy. Don't get me wrong, I still play it and enjoy it as I love everything about this game, but compared to the rest of the game it is poor.

## 187 [alexbobspoons on September 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1791987)

So far I agree with all three of you there on all aspects.

The quest is basically: wander through tunnells.

The key: Avoid locate-tests and big trolls.

Thats the essence really.

I didnt "not" enjoy it, but not really inspired either. So probably one more play then move on.

Authraw could be right in that with 4 players the locate/lost mechanic could kick in much more often with more to loose..maybe.

I found watcher in the water much much harder than this. No way it deserves a 7 (watch me get trounced later today now Ive said that)

Ha what did I say. Three more goes, two losses and a win.

Go1: Well I just seemed to draw every nasty enemy. 1 troll, 1 rock adder, goblin chieftam, 3 goblin sneaks all in play at once. Overwhelmed.

Go2: Was going ok, but failed a locate test with "Foul Air" and it took out two heroes and most allies, couldnt come back from it.

Go3: Won. Went pretty much to plan even though that spider cleaned my entire hand out at one point.

So, on to the next scenario.
I am feeling that Lore in this trisphere isnt performing as well as leadership did, so even with their splashes I may swap them back, though for first play on next scenario i will stick as is.

 

EDIT: The next scenario may be a little wait, as I usually play at weekends as we go away often. Next weekend, I am feeling the itch to take my CoC collection and build some decks then play some solo variant, so may well leave the beloved LotR collection at home for a weekend.

Righto

Two games at foundations of Stone today. Hmmm..

Game 1

Turn 1 I get the card that says choose a character and discard one from your deck and if the cost is equal of higher than your wounds, discard character. Only heroes out, so Gimli has 5 wounds, so I draw Gandalf, Gimli dead. Turn 2 I have a goblin swordsman, 3atk so Denethor defends and the shadow card adds 3atk so Denethor dead. Turn 3 I draw another goblin swordsman and a shadow card of a goblin swordsman so theres 1 in staging and 2 engaged and all I have up is... Eowyn. Eowyn died. 3 turns. What the heck!!!

So, Game 2

Went much better. All the way to stage 4 before dying fully through too many enemies. Watchful eyes were on all 3 characters too though unexpected courage helped with one. Weapons n armour sank in the water too eek, good job Gimli wasnt full powered.

So now I have a feel for the quest I have designed a deck. I felt that the biggest issues were treacheries and shadow cards as well as too much enemy.

So I have buffed up Eowyn with full x3s of the spirit cancells. Also dropped lore and Denethor and added Legolas (ranged for bats) and many more tactics allies. Am slightly worried about not having miner of the hills for those watchfull eyes, but I have treachery cancellation and x2 unexpected courage so hope it will cope.

Next play will see this deck have a go at Foundations of Stone. Might be tomorrow but I may play solo CoC tomorrow so not sure yet.

Was an interesting quest. Felt brutal but then I seemed to limp to quest card 4 so maybe not as brutal as I first thought. Go1 was ridiculous-brutal.

Onwards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

One game today, my new deck against foundations of stone. Rocked it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Deck worked just as planned.

Did get two lots of watchful eyes but one countered by an unexpected courage, the other disapeared when Legolas had to be shuffled into my deck (never to be seen again, but it was only penultimate turn).

Lots if resource, two tactics heroes did well earning resource when I am used to trisphere. Eowyn got song of kings and steward of gondor so loads of resource for spirit/leadership too.

Went really well.

I think lots of early locations did mean the latter stage encounter deck wasnt as bad as it could have been, so more goes with this deck to see if it will be consistant :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

My second game of the day was CoC after the joyus win at LotR

Two goes at foundations of stone today. Both losses.

1: Gimli died of a treachery turn 1 Argh and it went downhil, finally squashed me in phase2. I just didnt get my deck up and running.

2: Started better but also felt I didnt hit the ground running. Lost a lot of deck cards in stage2 then Squeezed my way into stage 4 but struggled. Managed to get myself suddenly location locked by Eowyn dying from a card reveal (lose questing character) (thus lost wp) and I had an underwater treasure location in play which then thus killed Legolas argh. I really didnt have enough allies out. Gimli on his own just didnt last, splat.

I still think this deck is ok for this scenario, just not perfect. Needs a bit of luck and careful playing to work.

Some more goes at this scenario before moving on I feel.

## 197 [alexbobspoons on October 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1843751)

Argh another loss.

Went really well again, 8/11 progress in stage 4 even though early on Gimli died due to excess shadow damage when I had nothing to cancel it, then Eowyn location locked against a nameless dude while underwater treasure was active, so I lost Legolas, then Eowyn wasnt enough on her own, so she died against a second nameless one.

Hmm.. maybe my desicion to explore the underwater locations is a bad one. Possibly I should quest through them, or add another Northern Tracker instead of Lorien Guide and clear them direct from staging?

Seem to do ok (not great) against this scenario until I drown a hero.

Need a rethink..

Argh another three losses so far today.

Each time I got to stage 4 and got battered by nameless ones, twice they had Gandalf as an X card so man they have been hitting hard.

Starting to get a little tired of this adventure, seems to be really hard for me and also seems like there are so many ways to make one mistake (or card draw) that kills a hero and then two heroes just donr cut it on this adventure.

Not sure if my deck design is bad for this one, but too late in the day to redesign today.

Im also thinking that the faster I quest through early stages, the less cards go into the stage 4 deck. So maybe if I go slooooowly through stage 1 and get lots of discarded cards, this will dilute stage4s deck and let me avoid nameless things. Stage 2 has to be a fast quester due to losing player cards each turn.

So maybe I will try a slow saunter through stage 1 (just started to try it but turn 1 I have 8 threat in staging so I do not see this lasting long)

So I am finding this a difficult and unbalanced quest for me so far. Certainly the hardest of Dwarrowdelf for me so far.

Yeeeah!

I tried the above slooow method on that game with 8 starting threat. Right through until the end and the questing phase went clockwork other than losing Legolas into my deck. I just needed to draw an encounter card with less than 3 threat and I win.. but I draw Crumbling Ruin... and everybody is exhausted.. so the if-able doesnt kick in and I win!

It was quite a hairy game and did feel close at times but glad of it.

Gosh I think I will put this quest behind me and next game will be next scenario (Balrog??)

Gosh that was tough.

I think next scenario will need a big deck redesign but I will try it with this deck first just to get a feel for the quest :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hmm

So i just had my first go at shadow and flame. The cards are beautiful and thematic but i have to say i didn't enjoy the quest much (yet).

It was far too brutal.

Balrog has 4 threat, so from turn1 Eowyn cannot break any questing ground on her own, BUT other than turn 1, the balrog will attack every round (no instant threat reduction) so I needed to have feints or chump blockers every turn to take the Bs massive damage. (Not to mention he got his whip and sword in first four turns).

So spending all Gimli n Legolas resources on chumps every turn. G and L not tough enough to take B down, so im treading water really.

Eowyn isnt getting any allies to quest with, so im losing ground on threat, no progress made.

Then i run out of chump blockers and each of the next three turns B kills a hero, all dead.

Not to mention the difficulty in how many cards I lost from card effects.

Just brutal.

I seem to need masses more chumps, more resource, much more questing, all before I can hold ground. Then Im guessing later I will need to heavy damage Mr B so will need to magic up more resource/attackers etc from somewhere.

I cant see me managing to raise resource for citadel plate or many weapon buffs when I need to keep getting chumps out.

Im sure others have good ways to tackle the scenario, but here for a first go it felt brutal brutal brutal.

Not a single progress made and all dead, I felt I did nothing at all but wait to die, no impact from me at all.

Rather deflating really.

I might have a go at putting some form of different deck together but not sure if I'll have another game today yet.

Sheesh even dol guldur let me feel I had done a little.

Brutal.

And following on from the above post I did have another go this time with the new deck.

Went better and as per deck plan.

Got all the way to stage 3 and 9 damage on Mr B but then it started slipping as he regenerated back and I lost heroes due to not drawing chumps.

So I never felt I had enough damage on to do a test on the location card, slowly lost all heroes.

I had gone Eowyn, Legolas, Theodred and worked well.

BUT.... Im not sure how I would have gotten Mr Bs health so low as to try a test (what do you need him at, 3 card draw so say 6 score so with 27 health you need 21 damage on him!! While regenerating 3 per turn...!!)

So how would I do different..?

Not sure yet.

Legolas did have lots of resource due to Steward of Gondor, so maybe swap Legolas for Gimli (cant I win without resorting to Gimli ever??) plus plate and axe... but even then, I dont think id have had the card draw to provide those attachments. Even then, getting 21 damage on (with regen) would still take 3+ turns.

So did much better, but no close to winning.

Brutal.

At this point you've unlocked Glorfindel and Light of Valinor. You need to take a very, very serious look at using those cards, as love it or hate, Glorfindel + Light of Valinor is the obvious solution to many quests. 5 Threat hero + 3 Willpower questing every turn + 3 Attack for combat every turn solves many, many problems.

 

If you swap out Eowyn for Glorfindel in your current deck you lower your starting threat by 4, lose only 1 Willpower a turn (+ some additional Willpower via Eowyn discarding) but then gain +3 Attack every turn which gives you 6 Attack with Glorfindel and Legolas assuming you can chump block or Feint. This assumes you go for Light of Valinor in your opening hand, but if you're playing Glorfindel and Light of Valinor you understand you have to mulligan for that. Glorfindel + Legolas kills many enemies that you are currently facing and then puts 2 progress on the quest from Legolas. Add in Rivendell Blade for 1 Tactics resource and you effectively have 8 Attack. Glorfindel also has 5 hit points to Eowyn's 3 hit points which gives you 1 more hit point to use for unblocked enemies, treachery direct damage, etc.

 

There's a reason (actually several of them) that Glorfindel reigns as the supreme Spirit hero. For the most part, quests only get harder and harder from here, especially Battle and Siege quests in Against the Shadow, which you are close to starting. While Eowyn is a solid hero, Glorfindel is far superior.

I was actually using light of valinor on legolas and rivindell blade but not glorfindell.

I hadnt thought of it as i tend to think of his low threat as a big bonus wheras this quest knocks you to zero threat first turn.

I may well swap eowyn out for him thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This in no means should be construed as disputing RobOz's suggestions/observations... but I have only ever played Shadow and Flame in progression mode, and have beaten it several times straight solo and 2-handed, and not once did I use Glorfindel. That having been said, neither Eowyn, nor Theodred were ever part of my successful line-ups, either. I did have some success with Legolas in 2-handed decks.  

 

And since I know you like to figure things out for yourself, alexbobspoons, I'll leave it at that... though feel free to ask if you want hints. :-)

No Problem.

 

Glorfindel + Light of Valinor on turn 1 is arguably the best first turn 1 play in the game. As I said before a 5 Threat hero that quests for 3 and attacks for 3 every turn is just too potent. This is why many people really dislike Glorfindel. If you are playing Spirit, he's almost always the best hero choice. But against particularly difficult quests, this play is often essential if you want a chance to win.

 

Don't know if you have Elrond's Council in your deck, but if not you probably ought to put that in too. It's one of the best Spirit cards in the game. Ditto the Arwen ally.

 

Also remember that extra Light of Valinor cards in hand are important to hold if you are up against a quest with attachment hate. Losing Light of Valinor due to a treachery or shadow effect is bad, so it's always good to have one in hand for that possibility.

Toying with the idea of a fully powered Gimli, with citadel plate and an axe... then adding khazad khazad..... then playing Heavy Stroke... would mean lots of damage in one turn...

Personally, I wouldn't recommend (Spirit) Glorfindel for Shadow and Flame, because his selling point is his low threat which makes no difference in SaF, plus if you don't draw LoV in your opening hand you can't quest with him unless you're prepared to take a hit from Durin's Bane, where generally that one round without one can be really nice. You might as well use Corefindel unless you have an aversion to Lore or don't like any other Spirit heroes - same stats but doesn't raise your threat if you get a poor opening hand.

I've never played SaF solo without breaking it, so I'm not sure exactly what I'd do, but there's a lot to be said for finding an alternative to chumping - for The Line Unbroken I used a buffed up Elrohir and Frodo, either of which could potentially work solo as well.

Becouse the starting threat does not matter, Elrond is a very good candidate. Elrond, Gimli, Eowyn?

Out of curiosity, what do you consider as breaking it? Attack avoidance (Hama, Galadriel, Nori)? Is Frodo considered breaking it as well?

Hama, Galadriel, Nori, yeah )though I've never done it with Hama myself). Using Frodo with the ultimate in threat ceilings and using Secrecy cards with high threat heroes I would class as more just very effective building around the mechanics, but the quest still plays as intended under those circumstances - Durin's Bane will attack you minimum once per round.

Got to tell you @alexbobspoons, this entire thread has been great fun to read. Thanks for sharing!

 

Takes me back to going through Core and the first couple cycles myself! You’re having it way harder than I did, though, since I got Core-Return to Mirkwood together and didn’t limit my player card use. Made Escape from Dol Guldur MUCH easier on me (plus I was playing 2-player). Reading this is really making me want to go back and run through those older Quests from the beginning through present (Heirs and Against the Shadow is probably my least favorite cycle so I might skip those) just to experience it all again. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

As for Shadow and Flame, I can tell you we defeated it using a pair of 100% Dwarf decks. They weren’t super-powered (built more for theme and missing a few clutch non-dwarf cards like Arwen and Steward of Gondor) but they did include some cards from the Hobbit boxes that you aren’t using yet. Between Dain, Gimli, Citadel Plate, Erebor Battle Master and effects like Heavy Stroke and Khazad Khazad we were able to lay down a lot of damage and still quest pretty powerfully. Readying can be provided by UC but also Erebor Record Keeper and Lure of Moria.

 

Don’t know how helpful my experience is to you, though. You have Dain, who is amazing and makes even so-so cards like Dwarven Axehand really effective, so you could try something similar. And without the thematic restrictions I was placing on myself you have access to a lot of cards I didn’t. But with only one player I’m not sure you’ll be able to get enough bodies on the board to make it effective.

 

More generally, Vassal of the Windlord shouldn’t be ignored due to his low cost and high attack. And remember that Hama can recycle your tactics events. And of course, since you’re starting at a low threat Boromir and Frodo can make much better use of their abilities. As somebody else also mentioned, Core Glorfindel is pretty champ here too with Light of Valinor.

 

Anyway—can’t wait to hear back to see how you do. Good luck and keep at it!

What worked for me straight solo, progression style, was Aragorn (Lead), Frodo Baggins (Sp), and Elrond (Lore). Took me five tries to score a win.

@TwiceBorn: I used a similar combo of Elrond, Gimli + Aragorn  I think.

Inluding lot's of healing and some deense boosting like Protector of Lorien . Most of the time Elrond could just take a direct attack from the Balrog and heal it back off. 

Gimli + plate was powerfull enought to to take the Balrog down.

## 217 [alexbobspoons on December 5, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1920320)

Hmmm just had a game and got smashed.
Swapped out Eowyn for Glorfindel Spirit. Added Asfaloth and a lore-song.

Just smashed.
Had light of valinor in opening hand but even with that, Balrogs threat of 4 was enough that I never placed a single progress. Also drew second deep and travelled to it so without damaging balrog I cant place progress.
Glorfindel and Legolas didnt draw weapons so could only do 3 damage to balrog which healed in every refresh, so could never progress the location.
Every turn I could just afford 1 ally who then dissapeared straight away as sacrifice to balrogs 6 attack.
Each turn I didnt manage to field an ally, balrog killed a hero until all were dead.

Couldnt progress 1 single point and couldnt damage balrog.

Nothing seemed to play out possitive.
I really am finding this quest the hardest I have done so far. The balrog is an auto sacrifice-ally every turn and just so hard to damage without extra allies and that 3heal.

I had good allies in deck, asfaloth, light of valinor, rivendell blades etc but didnt get enough out due to the onslaught.

Very very hard so far.
Not sure if my play is wrong, deck wrong or maybe both.
Harsh scenario!!
Not as fun as other scenarios just by its harshness so far, I like to feel I at least made some ground on a quest but this one is just a wait to die so far.

 

 

EDIT: Just watched the octgn video playthorugh above. Awesome plays, made it look so easy.

Also looked easier 2-player but I may be wrong.

You have two decks against two encounter cards, so thats balanced.

 balrog attacks against two decks defending, thats balanced.

Though TWO decks attacking against the same number of balrog hit points, seems 2-player gets an edge there.

Also, synergy of two players decks, eg playing cards on each other, that helps too.

Also, more resources to assign to a sphere.

They just seemed to get so many cards out.

Not taking anything away from it though, truly awesome playthrough and so well done, not a mistake seen to be made. Magic.

 

Ill be sticking to my solo 1-handed though. Need some more thinking on my deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So 2 player did seem to have some bonuses watching that video.

For Shadow and Flame, I had a Boromir Aragorn (Lore) deck with OHAUH Gandalf that smashed. The third hero was Bilbo for card draw but now would be Erestor.

I think Sneak Attack with Core Gandalf and/or Beorn is almost necessary for a solo victory, which is the main reason I would hold on to a Leadership hero like Aragorn, who can both quest/attack every round.

> I think Sneak Attack with Core Gandalf and/or Beorn is almost necessary for a solo victory, which is the main reason I would hold on to a Leadership hero like Aragorn, who can both quest/attack every round.

Good point, though his wp is only 2

I am thinking Frodo is in my next build without doubt.

So other heroes:

Gimli (powerful attacker bringing tactics attachments and blockers and allies)

Or

Aragorn (leadership cards valuable but his readying too resource costly)

Or

Glorfindel (high quest/attack with light of valinor plus ability to use and stack rivendell blade from tactics) Asfaloth aids too.

Choices choices choices

Solo one handed I often find I want cards from all four spheres lol.

Songs are good but dependant on card draw. (Narvis belt too. So maybe Dain Ironfoot with narvis belt and steward of gondor?)

Edit:

Im going to try Frodo, Gimli, Dain and build a deck for them and see what happens. Gimli with unexpected courage and Dains buff quests for 3wp so hopefully allies and cards will raise that.

So I tried it out.

Lost, but did get to last phase, 3 damage on balrog (was 6) and bust threat.

Despite losing, it did feel much more of a battle.

Frodo was awesome and with unexpected courage did shine.

Dain was good, but in single handed his bonus wasnt that amazing as so many dwarf allies needed to chump. The combo of steward of gondor with narvis belt was great though.

The things that let me down:

Losing Dain to a shadow card that added +3 to an already 3attack.

Balrogs whip pinching so so many of my good cards..grr.

No attachments on Gimli and no sign of second unexpected courage.

Not enough allies out.

No sign of gallhadrims greetings at all.

But I had zero dead cards and it did feel like a battle. I think some more games with this deck to see what happens before any more tweaking.

## 223 [TwiceBorn on December 6, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=1921429)

If you get Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn, he'll quest for 4 every round,. Get Steward of Gondor on him and his readying cost will be irrelevant (and again, the resources can support the playing of both Leadership/Spirit cards once you attach Celebrian's Stone to him). 

 

Just telling you what actually worked for me (this isn't a hypothetical exercise).

 

Edit: And if you have Elrond with Vilya and Unexpected Courage, you can potentially pump out a free ally or attachment every round. I'm telling ya, if you aren't going full dwarf deck, then Aragorn, Elrond and Frodo (with one or more Fast Hitches) is a good way to go. And remember that Elrond can also pay for out of sphere allies, so he can easily play 1-cost Tactics allies like Vassals of the Windlord that can be critical to victory. The deck won't win every time, but it'll get you there eventually (took me five tries, I think). : :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ouch--sounds like you're having a hard run on this one. 

 

Like @TwiceBornh said, Elrond/Vilya is a very powerful combo. Potentially a great target for Light of Valinor too. Though personally I don't play Hero Elrond as the Vilya engine just feels too mechanical it is without a doubt one of the most powerful combos in the game if you tune your deck for it. Protector of Lorien or Eowyn can do well in that combo too as it can let you discard cards that you can't get out with Vilya. And as previously mentioned Frodo is a champ for this since you have a little room for the threat. 

 

Like I said before, in my main run through I played one of a pair of Dwarf decks. But I have also played this with Eagles and I have to say that that's a great way to get some attack on the board. Vassal and Winged Guardian are great not only for their offense and defense but if you can keep them in play until you can get an Eagle of the Misty Mountains out they can pump him up hard when they leave.Then drop Support of the Eagles on someone and you can start to really raise your attack. Sprinkle in some direct damage from Descendant of Thorondor and you have a very decent combat deck.

 

I think I ran it with Hama for event recycling, Legolas for the ranged and weapons (you don't yet have some of the events that make this so good--but Hands Upon the Bow is still great and he always gives progress) and Imrahil for the action advantage, access to Leadership and some great chumps and utilities (Sneak Attack, Valiant Sacrifice, etc). This worked well but I had someone across playing Spirit/Lore so I don't know if it could hold together on its own...

 

Solo's hard because you really want to run tri-sphere to maximize your access to different--very necessary--effects like readying, card draw, resource acceleration and...hitting things real hard. But running tri-sphere strangles your resource production. But Core Aragorn with Celebrian stone can help that (and don't be fooled by the waste of the resource-add, Sword That Was Broken is still worth it on Core Aragorn) and he also gives access to Steward and Sneak Attack. 

 

Good luck!

Victory!!!!

After quite a break I had a game tonight. Dain/Gimli/Frodo.

Won with final threat at 44.

Gimli with citadel plate, fully damaged/buffed plus bonus from Dain plus veteran axehand plus Beorn really weighed damage on Balrog and made it possible. Many chump blockers and a few Frodo dodges took the main damage.

Timely aid was great while threat was low. Dain had narvis belt and steward of gondor which all helped.

Hard fought but good. I did find questing stage 1 very hard with these heroes but Gandalf sneak attacked and played normally made that aspect possible.

Didnt think I would get this one yay :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Fantastic! Congrats :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

So what's next? Moving on to Heirs or the Hobbit Boxes?

 

Personally, I would go Hobbit Boxes. They should give you all the pieces you need to make really great Dwarf decks and have a few clutch events even outside of that. 

 

I'm a little biased though--I've been pretty vocal about my dislike for Heirs and the Against the Shadow Cycle. Story was interesting but the designers went the unfortunate direction of way too much focus on Mono-Sphere. Not only did several quests punish you for running multi-sphere decks, but many of the player cards were pretty lame outside of Mono...

To keep with my progression style it will be Hobbit :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] My first saga.

Should I try campaign mode first or single plays?

I plan to try the example decks before tweaking them.

The Hobbit boxes don't exactly have a campaign, just the treasure cards you can add to your decks.

This. ^

 

Campaign mode started in the Lord of the Rings saga boxes. The treasure cards are pretty cool though. Though it's easy to miss the first ones. 

 

I would also suggest doing both Hobbit boxes back-to-back. It doesn't completely jive with your chronological playthrough but it's a much better experience going through all the Quests together.

Yes I plan that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] chronologically the second hobbit box pops up part way into the next cycle so id rather keep some continuity thus will back to back the hobbits :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks for the advices.

Another go at shadow and flame with a loss due to threat bust. I simply didn't draw the key cards I wanted (poor deck balance lol) so had masses of resource but not the right useful cards to spend them on. Finished still on stage 1 with only 1 progress (that **** location that only allows progress if Balrog is hurt) and balrog with 13 damage (though was mostly untouched for most of the game) cave troll was skulking in staging too up until last couple of turns.

Didn't draw celebrians stone, or narvis belt, or any gandalfs (huh and 2 sneak attacks in hand) no citadel plate, dwarrowdelf axe was very late, no beorn etc.

So onto the Hobbit.

Have setup first encounter deck and selected out a player deck. I have decided at first to try one of their suggested period decks, so went for the leadership/spirit deck. Looking at the cards I am unsure on this, but will give it a few goes before I look to deck design. First deck without core Gandalf.

So next play session will see how it goes.

Have you tried an Elrond+Vilya deck? If you really just want to get past Shadow and Flame, that's what I'd recommend.

Haven't tried that (but seeing as its you, I know it would work lol) but I did beat it once so am happy to move on for now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] thanks though!

Yeah...I don't remember thinking too much of those period decks. 

 

As for no Core Gandalf...that's kind of a hard pill to swallow for where you are. OHaUH Gandalf has recently become really good with Merry and Narya but Nori just can't lower your threat fast enough to make him effective in my experience.

Im not holding out hope, they arent deck designs im comfy with but i do like the idea of trying the suggestion decks before my own decks.

Think im gonna get stomped..

Well, at least you'll be able to get a glimpse at the quest before you run it through for real with your deck. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

There's some errata for the Troll Key and Troll Purse you should check out when you're ready to run the Quest. I don't remember exactly what the problem used to be but it was really easy to get into a situation pre-errata where you couldn't get the Treasures without completely exhausting the encounter deck.

So going on to try out the Hobbit after Khazad-Dum eh?

Good luck! Not a big fan of the hobbit boxes so I hope you enjoy them! Some of the quests are extremely hard... especially for a limited card pool... battle of five armies still gives me a lot of trouble even with a powerful deck made up of the entire cardpool!!

 

Heirs of Numenor and against the shadow is brutal too if you are going on to that cycle after the Hobbit Boxes......

its going to be very different from Mirkwood and Dwarrowdelf! All the best of luck! Hope to hear about your experiences soon!

Mirkwood I really enjoyed, Dwarrowdelf I did enjoy but not quite as much and found it more difficult. I am slightly nervous about increasing difficulty, shame there aren't more lighter quests.

Still hoping for fun.

Once your card pool expands a bit more some of the quests from VOI and Ring Maker Cycle as well as some of the quests from the Lost Realm and Angmar Awakened cycle are on the lighter or easier side.

Good luck with HoN/Against the Shadow and the Hobbit quests though! Might take a little bit to get used to the increased difficulty. 

Actually Encounter at Amon Din fairly early in the AtS cycle is one of the easiest quests in the game so that will give you a bit of a break in the middle!

 

Yeah its definitely still fun, a few quests a bit less so than others.... (for me personally at least into ithilien, flies and spiders and the lonely mountain are amongst the worst designed, least fun to play and most broken/) just a fair bit harder. You will obviously get a whole handful of new player cards though which will help. For that particular cycle it might be worth while using cards from future expansions (if you own any) rather than playing in the whole progression method as some quests can be seriously hard. Progression style will only make it even harder than it already is.

## 240 [TwiceBorn on March 1, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2078316)

I, for one, really enjoyed The Hobbit boxes and count The Lonely Mountain and The Battle of Five Armies among my favourite quests.

 

I just finished playing Heirs of Numenor and the Against the Shadow cycle in January, playing progression style straight solo, as well as 2-handed. I found most quests in HoN and AtS were actually easier to beat straight solo than 2-handed... and I'm no Seastan :-). Siege of Cair Andros is an awesome quest (that one might have been easier 2-handed), as are The Steward's Fear and Blood of Gondor. I swore a lot at The Morgul Vale (and, to a lesser extent, at Into Ithilien 2-handed). Thematically, I think HoN/AtS is superior to Mirkwood and Dwarrowdelf.

Wow--interesting.

 

I really didn't know that the Hobbit Boxes were considered all that difficult. I would have said they were for the most part on-par with the Dwarrodelf cycle quests if not a little easier. I think I only ever lost one of those Quests and I've played through all of them a couple times. And I usually consider myself a pretty average player.

 

HoN, on the other hand, destroyed me the first time I played through it. Probably ran Into Ithilien a dozen times before scoring a win (probably by luck!) and Cair Andros took me down 3 or 4 times too before I cracked it. Difficulty did cool down a bit from there but I got slapped around hard at first. 

 

I play almost exclusively two-player, all-purpose decks, though, so that could account for my different experience in difficulty. But for me HoN was way harder. 

 

Another nice thing about doing the Hobbit Boxes next is that you'll have a solid based of Dwarf cards when you're done.

Hmmm

so today I had a go at "we musr ere away the break of day" without foreknowledge and using one if the suggested decks.

Epic fail

Firstly, I powered through stage 1 too fast without realusing what stage 2 would bring. So I didnt have enough resources or allies/cards out in play.

Second, woah once you hit stage 2 the threat in staging rockets up. My ultimate demise was a threat bust as I had heroes defending/attacking so very little questing so my own threat went up masses each turn and when starting at 30, it was only about 3 turns until bust.

But...

Also I think the suggested deck was crap for this scenario. You get enfaged by a troll with 10 health and 2 defence while his mate sits in the staging area with active card text saying only one character can attack at a time... so without ganging up this means I can only damage the troll with a character of 3 attack or more, which in this deck is only Gandalf or Thorin.

Well Thorin gets sacked first troll turn and Gandalf never showed up. So I had no way at all to kill the first troll while threat just skyrocketed.

Wasnt happy at all with the ffg "suggested" deck. This quest seems very combat aimed and the deck had none of that. Due mostly to the deck, I had no way to damage them thus no way to win. Wasnt happy.

So a redesign on deck is a must. Cant be bothered right now as this game really deflated me, I never felt things looked like they could go right.

In doing a deck design for this, I think high damage from single character looks important, which does Im afraid make me think of Gimli. Gimli features so much in my deck designs Im starting to feel I rely on him too much and would rather have alternatives to get my high damage. One way is many allies but that would not work for this scenario, so it will likely be Gimli again.

Never thought an ffg deck would fair so bafly against the scenario it was meant for. This makes me think the two suggested decks are supposed to be played together in a two player game, which would probably give a much beter chance as well as soooo many gandalfs, but I like single handed solo thus two decks arent for me at this stage.

Not a great playthrough compared to most of mine.

I just looked over those deck lists.  I would have to say there is no way they were designed for solo play and definitely should be played 2 player (2 handed).   The other deck even uses your much loved Gimli.

I did wonder when I assembled the deck, but as I knew nothing of the scenario/adventure decided to risk it.

Thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] though my plan is to go through the whole game solo single-hand and then afterwards for a refreshing difference in mechanics/play, to start over and play through from the begining two-handed.

Yeah, I must admit that I had doubts about those recommended decks in The Hobbit saga when I first saw them. Never bothered trying them. I was just surprised that FFG would suggest something so obviously sub-standard.

 

I managed to complete the entire Hobbit saga progression style with the same three dwarf heroes, so it definitely is feasible. I'm sure you'll figure out a winning strategy before long, Alex. 

 

I was, however, disappointed that I could not have a solo deck with all 13 dwarves that went on the Hobbit quest... and if I recall correctly, Gimli and/or Dain were among my heroes, which was just a little anti-thematic, but oh well... I still really enjoyed the variety and unique challenges presented by the 6 quests, some of which remain among my favourites to this day.

I once built a deck with those heroes, and that was the reason for begin buying nightmare. I did once defeat a Journey in the Dark 3 players, winning after both the other decks died. And that was an easy victory in the end.

Then I used cards up to ring-maker (it was when ring maker was new), so your will not be as powerful as it would be with more cards, but it´s quite good (even without Éowyn :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]).

My theory is that Nori will be a good substitute for Eowyn once buffed up by Dain, who will be "ready" during the quest phase, then I will have both Gimli and Dain available during combat and if Dain isnt needed, he can stay ready to buff Gimli due to the one-attacker rule.

Add in the usual combat cards from tactics (axes, armour, feints), usual leadership (celebrians, steward of gondor, sneak attack) usual spirit (Galhadrims greetings, treachery/shadow cancels etc) then I think core Gandalf for his damage when played ability. Then a sprinkle of allies as cannon fodder, dwarves if possible because of Dain, but evenly spread due to resources.

Seems like a plan :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The Hobbit Saga is definitely do-able solo. It was the first thing I jumped into after playing the core set, and I was able to beat all six quests with the same three heroes with a thematic deck, though I did have to tweak a few cards for the last two quests, a base deck succeeded at the first four without modification, and the final deck I think would have worked for all six). The final deck configuration:

Total Cards: (50)

Hero: (4)

1x Bilbo Baggins

1x Bombur

1x Ori

1x Thorin Oakenshield

Ally: (23)

3x Gandalf (OHaUH)

2x Gloin

3x Longbeard Orc Slayer

3x Fili

2x Bifur

2x Dori

3x Erebor Hammersmith

3x Miner of the Iron Hills

2x Kili

Attachment: (9)

3x Cram

2x Self Preservation

2x King Under the Mountain

2x Forest Snare

Event: (18)

3x Expecting Mischief

2x Lore of Imladris

3x To Me! O My Kinsfolk!

3x Sneak Attack

3x Burglar Baggins

2x The Lucky Number

hmmm so I played a game tonight with my new deck. I still got smashed though my devk design worked better.

I still quested through stage 1 too fast.

I added celebrians stone to Nori, so with Dains buff he was questing for 5 and I thought this good to keep other characters free, but he quested a bit too fast for me to build up a force.

Though coming up to stage 2 I had citadel plate on Gimli and Steward of Gondor on Dain... then disaster, a card removed ALL of my attachments on the very turn I got to stage 2 (and Id just used my Test of Will)... so they all dissapeared.. argh Gimli suddenly weakened.

So I tried as best I could against the trolls but I didnt have enough troops to counter, 2 engaged straightaway and sacked 2 heroes eeek.

My threat soared as there was suddenly +11 threat in staging from trolls and troll-cave and I hadnt soent threat to keep 2 trolls engaged (idiot).

A poor combat round killed my shielding troops and things werent looking good.

Next round, because I had let the trolls back into staging, all 3 engaged and sacked the rest of my team, thus game over at threat 48.

Not a good result.

I think I quested too hard too early and didnt build up enough forces and attachments. I also should havevsaved Test if Will for that terrible attach-destroy card.

I need to be slower through stage 1, get many troops out, get Gimli armoured and weaponed up, draw some sneak attacks for Gandalf, get some resource generated. I think my current devk does do this I just played it wrong. So will try harder next time.

10, 11 and 12 hit points on those trolls is some damage to get down when taken with their card effects.

And another go today. Hmmm. I think I have too many unecessary cards in my deck. I quested slowly and got threat up to about 40 without getting my favourite cards out. Then I completed stage 1 and the trolls came in, immediately 2 heroes sacked.

Following turn, not enough defenders so the two sacked heroes took undefended damage and died (they werent defending so didnt break sack rules, I guess they got eaten).

Threat rocketed but Gandalf dialed it back a bit while alliesvdefended/died and Gimli got a hit in. Using khazad khazad followed by heavy stroke he did 8 damage to a troll yay, but all in vein as next go, threat bust at 50.

So my thoughts... need to trim unecessary cards out of the deck. Maybe replace with more cheap ally blockers to round out at 50 cards. Quest even slower if I can. I need to be entering stage 2 with a powered up Gimli, many chump blockers and also a high quester (celebrians on Nori) to discard encounter cards.

Im finding this again another hard quest. The trolls just hit hard while ramping up threat.

Games getting harder for me I think lol.

Ok so I tweaked my deck with more cheap allies and got it to bang on 50, havent tried it yet (may do later today) but if/when it fails I think I will try another tactic.

Even if Gimli is powered to the max (damage plus armour plus weapon, and it isnt easy getting damage on him in this adventure without killing him by overdoing it) and using unexpected courage, it would still take 2 rounds to kill the trolls while threat whooshes.. so after the next game Im thinking design a deck to high quest (Eowyn, Ally Faramir, lotsa cheap allies) to try and discard through the encounter deck.

Unsure on the other two heroes. Leadership is needed for steward of gondor and celebrians stone as well as cheap allies and faramir. So a leadership hero. Maybe Theodred for resources.

Third not sure. Spiritfindel? Or a tactics hero just for access to feint? Maybe a lore hero to get Henemarth Riversong for accurate stage 1 questing? Not sure yet. Will play my above offensive deck once before this rebuild.

I'm not sure what you mean about trying to "discard through the encounter deck".

 

Running out of encounter deck cards only matters if you're dealing shadow cards and run out. In all other cases where you need to draw from the encounter deck, an empty deck just means you reshuffle the discards.

 

But maybe I'm misunderstanding your meaning.

Usually yes BUT specifically in this adventure, the winning conditions are to kill the trolls (very hard) OR to go through the entire encounter deck (which simulates the passage of time in the book resulting in daybreak defeating the trolls)

So youre right generally but not for this specific quest. Killing the trolls has proven difficult so I plan to power through the encounter deck (in this scenario, instead of successful questing adding progress tokens it discards encounter cards instead).

Hope that explains a bit more.

## 258 [TwiceBorn on May 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2195871)

If I recall correctly, wouldn't questing through the entire quest deck without exploring the Troll Cave and confronting the trolls mean you couldn't claim the treasures (Glamdring and Orcrist) for use in subsequent scenarios?

 

Don't have time to double check.

## 259 [PocketWraith on May 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2195932)

Yes, you have to explore the Troll Cave in order to claim Glamdring, Orcrist and Sting; however you can travel to the Troll Cave with just the Troll Key which you obtain simply by damaging the troll it's attached to, you don't have to kill it outright. The Troll Purse makes it cheaper of course, but that does require a kill. Alternatively you can just not get the treasures, though obviously it's preferable if you can.

Also bear in mind that the troll key is hidden within the encounter deck, so powering through the encounter deck will bring it out. Once its out and attached to a troll, one damage on the troll will drop it and then Bilbo scoops it (providing hes not in a sack, in which case things are looking bad). Whooshing through the encounter deck does seem to kinda recreate the events and outcome of the book. Quite well designed there.

Im going to have a go with my redesigned offensuve deck first, then will redesign for encounter-whoosh.

## 261 [alexbobspoons on May 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2198477)

so a game tonight and a loss.

But I gave it a good shot and now more convinced I need to redesign for high questing.

Gimli got ptetty powered up and I had 6 allies out just before entering stage 2.... then disaster. Treachery of "roast em or boil em" killed 4 allies... argh my blockers.

So into stage 2, sacking happens and it thins my party. Then Gimli takes a hit to get fully powered and 2 feints avoid the other 2 trolls. Gimli with unexpected courage takes one troll to only 1hp remaining and another to only 2hp remaining. Bilbo gets the troll key, yeah! Next round, Gandalf plays in and I realise I forgot to keep trolls engaged, they are back in staging ooooooops!!! Do Gandalfs arrival kills one of the damaged trolls, leaving one healthy and one clinging to life, but then as the trolls engage, sacking happens and everybody ends up in a sack eek.. then in combat sacked heroes die.. next round, with sacked heroes about to die, threat busts anyway.

Well at least I killed one, nearly two trolls.

Now to redesign for the questing method :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I find that it is ok to build a 50 card deck for solo with just one Core but if you want to toy with harder quests or with play with friends who do not have their own cards, smaller decks can let others have fun as well. I notice after building a 50 card deck with a single core, there isn't much left to make anything worth playing, not even for support.

Success!!!

 

So I redesigned the deck to go for strong strong questing in order to discard through the encounter deck (wait for sunrise) and it worked.

 

I had Dain standing ready with Eowyn (with favour of the lady) and Nori (with favour of the lady card2 and Dains buff) and bilbo questing, supported by sneak attacked gandalfs (and a standard gandalf) and Arwen questing. Arwens ability gave Dain an extra defense to raise it to 4. All then buffed further by Faramir. So I had massive questing!

2 lots of Galadrhims greetings plus gandalfs appearances kept threat low so I only had one troll engaged and then in combat, Dains 4 defence meant he only took one damage er turn (and I lost a chump blocker too). Though the first sack went on Faramir (argh) until Troll Camp appeared and Bilbo got rid of the sack.

So Dain took damage while I quested massively through the deck and it seemed to work well. Gandalfs appearances for threat lowering and questing bonus really helped. Arwen buffing Dain was good too.

I didnt get the treasure, was concentrating on winning, so Im happy with the result and can now either replay with my winning deck or comfortably move onto adventure 2.

Yay the strategy worked :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] No heroes died.

 

Happy I got this one beat, it stumped me for a bit and wasnt massively varied and fun compared to other quests.

## 264 [alexbobspoons on July 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2324569)

So my first game for a while.

Over the Misty Mountains Grim

I stuck with the same deck as last game until i get a feel for this adventure, so questing was heavy and combat low.

Phase 1 heavy questing helped but i did have to engage a giant, Gandalf was on hand to help beat him though.

Phase 2 wasva problem, too much combat, i lost, but i did kill the great goblin and had 9/20 progress on the quest at death.

Foolishly i got Bilbo killed, but i wouldnt have lasted much longervanyway, too many engaged monsters :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So do i deck tweak or just try again? Im trying not to just go Gimli for combat yet again because nothing seems to come close. I already rely on Eowyn for questing. Too much reliance on my staple heroes.

Good game though!

I Approach this quest most of the time by taking the first stage slow (I like to Keep the giants in the staging area, at least in the beginning), what means I tech for much healing/damage reduction. As there isn't much ally hate except the giants (should they attack) iirc, I use this stage to fill the board with them. In the best case you finish this stage with lots of baggins ressources and make sure you can kill the great goblin as soon as he appears. Be careful with the use of attachments as Long as heavy rain can destroy them all.

 

I'd suggest tweaking the deck for a Little more combat. If you have the enemies under Control nothing should stop you from slowly but surely winning the Long game.

So today I played Over the Misty Mountains Grim.

I won :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I had redesigned deck to be Eowyn spirit, Gimli tactics and Dain Leadership.

First stage went well gathering forces though not many, Arwen ally really helped. Did lose Steward of Gondor and Celebrians Stone to nasty treacheries.

Kept the Giant (Giants, one joined late on) in the staging area until quested through.

Second stage, Great Goblin and two other goblins attacked, took damage, following turn, quested to gain 4 progress, then quick strike from veteran axehand got one goblin, sneak attack Gandalf got another goblin with his play damage, feinted great goblin.

Then threw Gimli plus damage plus axe plus Dain-buff plus gandalf all at great goblin and killed in one go. Was 11 attack plus 1 extra Dwarowdelf axe damage.

Next turn, Bilbo paid full cost for Gandalf and pretty much everyone quested (eowyn even discarded a card) to get the remaining 16 points i needed to quest through and win.

Went really well :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Did not even lose an ally, no deaths (not counting eowyn discarding two allies from hand at points)

Enjoyed that.

May well play this scenario-to-deck again before going on to next quest :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

And so I played again, same deck, same scenario.

This started out harder, I didnt get as many allies out, though the lovely Arwen did come running. I got Steward of Gondor onto Eowyn but was saving Celebrians Stone for in case of treachery.

Then disaster, not only did a card force a stone giant to engage, but in 2 turns I gained 2 more giants... three in play argh.

Gimli gained unexpected courage.

Dain Ironfoot fell to a giant..

Gimli then took a big hit but it angered him and he hit back well. Celebrians stone was played and everybody but Gimli quested as hard as they could to defeat the stage and thus discard all 3 giants... but then Great Goblin appears and engages...

Gimli feints him, then hits twice with unexpected courage, just enough to kill the goblin in that turn.

So now its just questing for the goal..

Many goblins spawn and surge and almost overwhelm but gimli with courage keeps most at bay while a couple of allies perish. Everyone else quests to the max, eowyn discarding useless leadership cards to buff and bilbo playing his burglar baggins cards.

Just as too many enemies were engaged to be able to defend, we hit the last quest progress and win.

Yay.

It was a lot closer and harder than last game and Gandalf never appeared, but with still a win I felt pretty good about that.

Seems a nicely balanced deck against the adventure, always hard to move on when I hit that as its fun to play the cards for a while without having to think about deck building. I may replay this another time before moving on

## 269 [Calvadur on August 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2387638)

> Gimli feints him, then hits twice with unexpected courage, just enough to kill the goblin in that turn.

 

Did you attack the goblin twice with Gimli during the same phase? Without something like quick-strike?

I am pretty sure that's impossible as you can only declare one attack without specific Cards and there is no Action window to ready Gimli before the declaring attackers step Ends. After that step you can't declare an attack against the goblin, again.

 

From the rule-book:

In order to declare an attack, a player must exhaust at least 1 ready character. A character must exhaust to be declared as an attacker. When declaring an attack, a player must also declare which enemy is the target of the attack. A player may declare multiple characters as attackers against a single enemy, pooling their attack strength into a single value.  A player has the opportunity to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged.

 

To resolve an attack against an enemy, a player follows these 3 steps, in order. Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step.

 

1. Declare target of attack, and declare attackers. A player does this by choosing 1 enemy with whom he is currently engaged, and exhausting any number of characters as attackers.

 

2. Determine attack strength. Add up the total attack strength (Û) of the attacking characters that have been declared against that target.

 

3. Determine combat damage. This is done by subtracting the target enemy’s defense strength (Ú) from the combined Û of all the attacking characters. The remaining value is the amount of damage that is immediately dealt to the target. If the Ú is equal to or higher than the Û, no damage is dealt.

 

Characters that are declared as attackers are only considered to be attacking through the resolution of the attack. Once an attack has resolved, the characters are no longer considered “attackers,” but they do remain exhausted.

 

After a player’s first attack has resolved, he can declare another attack against any eligible enemy target that he has not yet attacked this round. Each player can declare an attack (with any number of eligible attackers he controls) against each enemy with which he is engaged once each round. Once all of a player’s attacks resolve, play proceeds clockwise from the first player until all players have resolved all of their attacks.

 

 

 

Good Job anyway staying in the game after Dain died so early on and facing 3 giants!

**** I missed that, I was going by the page 21 diagram play where you can fully resolve an attack, then afterwards declare a new attack/target and resolve that... combined with the play summary diagram showing the steps as green thus ok to play cards/abilities between steps of a phase.

So Gimli is fine to attack the goblin fully, Then ready with unexpected courage, then declare and carry out a second attack.... however what I missed was the "not yet attacked this round" so while Gimli could have hit another goblin, he couldnt have hit the same goblin.

Oops.

Thinking on it, this would have left the great goblin in play for another round, so fili would have most likely chump blocked and died before Gimli finished the great goblin. I think I had enough other allies and final questing amount that it wouldnt have affected the outcome, but you never know :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks for the heads up.

Ok so a game of Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim

 

About to lose but havent lost yet, but I will do.

 

I can see why the Hobbit boxes dont have a good rep, this isnt particularly an enjoyable game.

 

Firstly the deck is kicking 2 cards at me each time in staging, so its hard to quest against at first, but also a few of those cards are surging, so I am getting overwhelmed by enemies, while other cards are having me search the decks for extra creatures and have them engage me, so I am burried under a ridiculous amount of enemies.

At the same time, I am not getting any progress on the quest as the repeated Goblin Caves location keeps tying me up.

 

To top all that, the riddles so far have been ridiculously hard, matching a sphere and a cost AND a type!!? Just couldnt do it.

 

Everybody is about to die, Ive gotten nowhere.

 

True this deck wasnt designed for this scenario, I just carried on with last scenarios winning deck, but still this is overwhelming.

 

My initial thoughts on a deck for this are to go very different and chose Lore for a change to get some healing in there. There is so much damage going on that healing would be good. Then Spirit to try and quest hard. Flashing out the deck for those two spheres with lots of allies for attack and defend and a few utility cards. Thats only my first thoughts though. I do tend to rely on my Tactics and Leadership so it would be a big change.

 

Not the most fun of quests so far really (and the next one chronologically is Battle of Laketown, sheesh a known hard quest, maybe a need a break and replay some earlier scenarios just to get some leisurely wins under my belt)

 

Alex

 

EDIT: All dead, managed to get 5 progress on the quest at the end but it still never went my way.

Will not be able to play this quest again without a full deck redesign so I need to think about it and come back later. Never feel great when a quest seems to require this extent of full deck design straight out of the box :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] maybe its just my bad playing.

It definitely isn't your bad playing. This quest can be a walk in the park with a deck designed for it but if you aren't building your deck specifically with this quest in mind it can actually be really punishing. 

Some will find this sort of cheating or at least somewhat dodgy but it massively helps to know your deck/s forwards and backwards when playing this quest (know exactly how many attachments, allies and events there are, know how many 1 cost, 2 cost, 3 cost etc cards there are and know the sphere breakdown so like 35 lore cards 15 spirit cards or whatever). 

This way any time you have to do the riddles you have a slight advantage of knowing what cards will most likely be revealed. 

It's a little bit like counting cards in poker  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 

Yeah the hobbit boxes are really average. There are some that absolutely love them and while I can sort of see why they do I personally can't stand them and pretty much never play them. 

Most of the quests require you to deck build around them or you will suffer (especially Caverns, We Must Away and the Lonely Mountain). Most of them are too swingy and luck dependant and have tons of surge as well. In The Lonely Mountain Smaug can make like ten consecutive attacks which is just crazy. All that being said though I do really love Over the Misty Mountains Grim and The Battle of Five Armies. Those two quests are great.

I must be one of the few who likes the Hobbit Saga quests, and Over the Misty Mountains Grim, The Lonely Mountain and The Battle of Five Armies in particular. I actually liked the way riddles were handled in Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim... even though at times the mechanics really did piss me off!

If you're playing chronologically, Flies and Spiders and The Lonely Mountain come before The Battle of Lake-Town... which is another favourite of mine. That was the first quest I encountered that really required outside the box thinking/deck building to win (even more so than Dungeons Deep)... but the design of the quest is, IMO, awesome (just recently found out that a similar approach was required to take on The Three Trials solo). And once you figure out a viable approach, the quest becomes really enjoyable.

 

I sympathize with you regarding time and effort spent redesigning decks after each quest, which can be annoying/discouraging... but don't lose heart! I think you'll feel tremendous achievement when you finally succeed!

Not playing chronologically, playing in release order, so as I understand it, Laketown is next and then afterwards Id have to check, its either Hobbit-2 or Heirs of Numenor

 

I must admit, while I had the thought of card counting, its not something I would enjoy putting my mind through, so a big part of me cant be bothered as it wouldnt be fun for me. I think I will be going Lore/Spirit for this one, or maybe even mono. So I plan to lay out all my Lore and Spirit cards, choose ones I feel will work well, which will likely be allies as so-far the focus has been questing and combat, which scores of allies will do nicely, and then decide on the split. Would be nice too if I could tailor it to similar cost cards but I dont think I would get the best deck from one made entirely of lore-allies-3cost or similar lol.

 

Need to set aside a game session just to play about with my collection to come up with a deck as a basis for another go before I start fine tuning it on subsequent goes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Nice to know my old thread still gets reads when I update it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I have bought into so many games now that I dont play any as often as I used to just due to playing different ones, but the LotR love is still 100% there :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Well, I don't how how can it be considered cheating / dodgy. Counting / remembering cards you played while knowing by heart your deck is the needed skill to beat this quest with a "normal" deck (say, not a mono sphere deck without attachments or events and with only 2 and 3 cost cards). It is just one important skill to master to play that kind of game.

Knowing your deck well against this quest is nowhere near as powerful as stuffing it with two-cost allies.

The issue with Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim is that if you don't build specifically for it then it's likely to be frustrating even if you can pull out a win, but if you do build specifically for it it's pretty easy to just trivialise the quest by being really good at riddles.

If you want a bit of a middle ground, rather than just memorising what's in your deck and watching what goes into hand/play/discard, since every time you answer a riddle you have to shuffle your deck first, you could just take the opportunity before shuffling to look at all the cards left in there, quickly scan for what looks most common.

Counting / remembering cards you played while knowing by heart your deck is the needed skill to beat this quest with a "normal" deck (say, not a mono sphere deck without attachments or events and with only 2 and 3 cost cards). It is just one important skill to master to play that kind of game.

I don't consider it either of those things I just figured others maybe would? I agree that you sort of need this knowledge to win if you aren't building specifically for this deck.

Funny you mention this! This is actually exactly what I would do when playing this quest. I would look at everything remaining in my deck and try to figure out what is the most likely cost, sphere or card type to appear. Still results in some failed riddles but helps massively and doesn't require you to keep track of every card etc. Much better suggestion than mine!

So I designed some decks for this scenario specifically.

I decided to go mono-sphere and couldnt decide between Spirit and Lore so I did both. Wasnt planning two handed, simply try each and see how they went single handed.

 

My theory was the simple, cram the deck full of as many allies as I could. I aimed for 2 and 3 cost allies (couple of 4's). When I laid out all such cards, adding Gandalf meant I was a few cards short of 50 and so I added about 5 utility cards such as unexpected courage for spirit and healing cards for lore. (Bear in mind I am playing progression so only have so many allies "available").

 

Heroes:

Lore = Denethor, Aragorn, Berevor

Spirit = Eowyn, Glorfindel, Frodo

 

Tried the Spirit first, just now. Smashed the quest lol.

 

3 mono heroes meant lots of resource to get cards out compared to my usual tri-sphere.

Lots of allies out means lots of chump blockers and lots and lots of questing, so the enemies werent too bad and the questing went well.

Mono sphere mostly allies of 2 or 3 meant riddles were a doddle :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Only scary moment was the last phase where I quested everyone for a total of about 21 haha but the treachery came out that gave -1 to each characters questing and so it reduced it way down to about 14 so instead of steamrolling the quest in one turn, I ended up still on the quest with all characters exhausted (apart from Glorfindel who had unexpected courage) and so the amount of damage I took from the few engaged goblins nearly killed some heroes. All heroes from this ended up 1 damage from death apart from Bilbo who was 2 from death... but they all survived.

Next round they all quested again and smashed the progress limit to bits.

 

So, I have to be honest here, I was playing this with a view to win once and put it firmly behind me and move on. But I really enjoyed this quest with this deck lol. Just shows how a deck that works ok with a quest turns it from a hard slog to a fun tactical challenge where you enjoy it because you have a chance to win all throughout.

 

So right now, I am feeling that before moving on, I want to throw my Spirit deck against it at least one more time and also, seeing as I built it, Im thinking of giving the lore deck a go too.

I dont think the lore will do as well because it isnt as strong at questing and Glorfindel was pretty useful plus Frodos defense was good and Eownys questing excelled as usual, though the healing of lore may well be very good to occupy the goblins.

Im thinking anothe go at Spirit, then trial the Lore deck (and maybe lose) then another Spirit to bring back up the do-able challenge.

 

I do enjoy the deck building puzzle of this game, but I also really enjoy it when you get a deck you feel is balanced for the quest, as then you can forget about deck building/tweaking and just play the game for the experience of playing the game. All that lies between defeat/victory are the random deals and your personal choices. makes the "game" aspect more fun.

 

So I eat my words. My post above told how I thought this quest was awful... but I thoroughly enjoyed tonight and really do want to have more plays at this quest now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Feeling really good about how fun that was :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

EDIT: PS my finishing threat was 41, which I think was pretty high considering the low start of 21 but there were a lot of things, including Frodo and Glorfindel, that raised threat a lot lol

Huh

So I decided to trial the Lore deck so I could get it out of the way and give Spirit another go, and also smashed the quest to pieces.

 

My end threat was 30, which was my starting threat :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] as I didnt use Aragorns ability until the last turn so thought hey why not lol.

 

It was an ally fest, ran out of width on my mat. So many allies, strong questing, plenty of chump blockers but only needed 2 as Denethor defended every turn until the last (was a questing push all-in). Aragorn did a little fighting but so did ally Dori supported by Erebor Hammersmith. most everybody else quested every turn. Every riddle had successes, I think I only dropped one riddle success al game and that particular riddle was out of 3 cards so I was happy with it.

 

Gandalf did make one appearance, which killed a bothersome Goblin and then added good questing power.

 

Another fun game, though I cant decide which deck now worked better.

I think I enjoyed the Spirit game more as it felt more challenging, this deck seemed to steamroll the quest easier.

 

Mono sphere is great for resource and getting cards out :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Had fun. Not sure how many times to play this scenario now that I have 2 decks for it lol. maybe another 1 per deck then move on :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

EDIT: I did have another one per deck and won both times :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So

After a long absence due to other games, then Xmas, then breaking my hand, today I got back to LotR LCG.

First was a long job of writing up my previous two decks into my deck log, then because the last quest was a very specific deck-design, I decided to construct a generic deck from my older games and so put together a Eowyn, Gimli, Theodred. Then to decide what scenario.

So chronologically its either Heirs of Numenor of Battle of Laketown. Battle has quite a hard rep but so does Heirs. o I plumped for Heors and assembled the firs quest.

Got SMASHED!

First go stages a thug, then the taven disscard effect put up another thug and then the first questing phase pops up a brigand. So turn 1 I have 3 enemies, not enough resource yet for allies and only 3 heroes trying to hold their own.

I never managed to get ontop of the building enemy crowd and eventually simply lost to numbers, I just couldnt get up and running. Eowyn was useless for once hehe.

So did I enjoy it? Hmm, well the game itself was pretty poor as I never felt there was anything I could do, but then many times going blind through a first scenario I feel that, so it wasnt the best. The game experience of messing with the cards and decks was fun though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I feel for this one, I need to build something that due to the many enemies has a high defense as well as a high attack for defeating them as well as the battle-questing. My initial thoughts are to try out a mono-tactics but tactics with leadership may work nice too. Then again tactics with lore for healing could be good too. Not thinking about resource generation just yet. I think I will try mono tactics and see what happens. So who to pick?? Well Gimli is my go-to and I often like Legolas, so I will have a shuffe throug the cards and maybe try a brand new tactics hero I havent tried before :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Hope everyone is well! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, Heirs can be very hard :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] 

Tactics definitely is much more useful at least for the box than in other quests, just due to the higher attack/defense values on their Cards. But every quest has a Twist that "can" ruin the tactics only Approach, if you aren't prepaired.

When we first played peril in pelagir we must have been super lucky as we got a first try win (just to get slaughtered by into ithilien again and again) and usually I'd say you beat the quests by "try and error" advancing quest stage for quest stage until you figure out the quest out and have a plan for it, Obviously you could just check the quest and Encounter deck, but where's the fun in that :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

In general we tried to bring heroes who have at least two uses, e.g. because they have the stats (like Spirit Glorfindel who is good at willpower questing and battlequesting/attacking) or other usefull abilities (like lore denethor who is great for siege questing/defending or could scry the Encounter-deck when there is no other use for him).

In retrospective I miss the "heirs days" as there are so many memorable situations/Cards/games etc. Facing an Mumakil for the first time, getting completly wrecked by power of mordor, celebrating the first win agaist into ithilien...

Interesting. I had a great fun game with my new deck. It did quite well but still failed.

A late introduction of collateral damage cause 8 threat increase and bust the 50 limit argh, it was going ok until that point I was only 5 progress away from advancing to the last stage.

 

I think I had too much utility in my deck and not enough allies. More allies would increase the combat and also increase questing ability. I seemed to have utility cards spare in my hand so thats the direction I will redesign  the deck. I did find resource an issue but unless I introduce Leadership I done see an easy solution to that.

I did find I was over compensaated for combat. Citadel plate was just not needed and a bit of a waste of a card draw, More lower cost allies would be better.

 

It was a fun game though and mostly I felt I would lose BUT had a chance of winning, which was not the case in my last game against this scenario. So enjoyment has been had and progress made.

Ideas to go forward:

Less utility

More allies

Less attachments

More allies (did I say that?)

 

:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Had fun

## 284 [alexbobspoons on February 19, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2647878)

I had another go.

Didnt have time to tweak the deck so stayed with the same.

 

I crashed out with 50 threat halfway through the final stage. I had 2 of the 15 progress so didnt do too badly considering it was the last stage.

Went quite well, though collateral damage REALLY damages you. I cancelled on with a card but there are just so many. Also, discarding attachments was a kicker as I lost light of valinor from Glorfindel which was handily allowing him to quest without raising threat.

Questing on the final stage was difficult as I had lost Legolas right at the end of stage 2 due to a card effect causing damage (that I cant remember) so managing to balance attack/defend/quest with just the two heroes was difficult, especially with them loading on the freebie attacks due to the quest effect which thinned out my measly defenders.

 

I dont think with Legolas alive I would have managed to get the extra 13 progress at the rate I was taking hits from enemies. So I still think the deck needs tweaking. Again I still feel I need more allies. More allies gives more power to attack, defence and questing and I think extra numbers of bodies would make the difference in this quest. Attachments I can thin out, I think weapons are too expensive in this quest for what you gain (though if I ever get Citadel Plate onto Gimli he will demolish questing the "battle" stages) and born aloft (intention Gandalf) isnt getting used. Similarly although Ive failed through threat busting, I think Galhadrims Greetings is too expensive for the 1 spirit hero. So I think I need to trim out things like that and add in allies. Maybe more cancellation for spirit too though I dont want to affect the consistency of the deck by going too far over 50 cards (Im always around 53-55 it seems).

It did go fun though, I felt I had a slim chance up until Legolas died and quest 3 asked for so much progress.

Ah the joys of collateral damage :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png] I think it is among the most annoying Cards in the game as it is just a horrible way to loose. Even the Designers seem to accept that the Card is just unfun or they wouldn't have removed it for the nightmare set, right?

So two games today,  both losses. 

Game 1 went ok bit didn't get past stage 1, still having trouble defending enough whole attacking and questing. Can't seem to get enough out early enough. The quest starts with an enemy, then Quest rules potentially adds another at first Quest stage, then first questing can add something else to staging too.  So on turn one you can have three cards in staging before you've built enough resource to pay out cards of your own. 

I did ok for a bit but fell to too much combat. Died. 

I did feel that legolas was the weak link, he went down fast without giving much for his stats/abilities leaving me with only two heroes. 

Game two,  the first turn produced an extra enemy and the quest card was an enemy,  so three enemies and as yet I had not enough resource to get allies out and had committed one hero to quest,  so turn one legolas died as I couldn't defend enough. Sheesh this was not good. Following turns were similar and I died on turn three. 

 

So I have decided that defending is the big weakness and so as many state,  Boromir will be tried on this quest (I've never used him before). I'm a bit worried about threat but am taking three Galhadrims Greetings, and am also worried that his defense is 2 but most enemies hit for 3 and as I play progression I'm not sure what will raise his defense to 3 to combat. Maybe a dunedain card which may mean I have to swap out a character for a leadership one. I don't think I can swap glorfindel/spirit so Gimli may have to make way for a leadership hero.  If so,  I may need to slim down the tactics allies for leadership allies due to resource, or may include songs to redress that balance,  not sure yet. 

 

Sheesh this is a hard quest.  HoN has a reputation for difficulty but I hope it's level doesn't spoil the game for me. 

 

Onwards.  I have swapped legolas for boromir but no other deck tweaks yet. The game is set up on the table for tomorrow let's see what happens.

Peril in Pelargil is in my experience quest that you have to learn. I couldn't beat it at first, but now I can't lose it. It's a good way to understand scenarios with both battle and normal questing. But I wasn't playing progression series.

Have you unlocked Beorn already? He is great for this box, as he can either battle quest really great or tank a lot of early damage (and you see how hard beginings are in this scenario) and then swing back.

While Gondorian Shield isn't available until Steward's Field (to make Boromir a staunch defender), Heirs of Numenor comes with an excellent defending ally in Defender of Rammas.  Two-cost so you can play him first turn with double tactics, and his four defense will hold up to many enemies (five defense once Arwen is played).   Boromir will still do more for you than Legolas in this cycle because he can battle-quest and attack (and once you get to Gondorian Shield, defend as well).

Tries again today with Boromir substituted.

My draw hand wasnt great and there was no Light of Valinor, which I thought would be essential for Glorfindel, so I mulliganned. Got 3 Light of Valinors in hand and a few other spirit cards despite my decks weighing on tactics.

So I didnt have much in hand really.

The game played ok and I felt that the deck worked better against the scenario but I still lost badly. Turn 1 I had 3 enemies and I kept getting more so I got swamped under enemies.

Felt like harsh draws, so Ill give the same deck another go before I think any more about tweaking :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Those 3 Ramma's are sure in the deck, just dont always pop out, and Im only running a 50 card deck for consistency so its luck of the draw there.

In my HoN days, my Gimli/Thalin/Eowyn deck would often mulligan for Defender of Rammas, especially if the scenario opens with an enemy -- though I'd usually take the first attack undefended with TaGimli to power him up.  Eowyn wasn't much of an asset in some of those quests, as you might imagine.

I often do the same with Gimli. 

Eowyn has probably been my most played hero but at the moment she had made way for Glorfindel.

I'm slightly daunted by how hard I think HoN is going to be for me, especially progression style,  but I think I am starting to take shape on the deck design for the first adventure so hopefully I will get there after numerous trial and errors. The bar fight is a bit of a boring premise but the trickiness of the cards is making it quite a good head scratcher. Reminds me of the repeated goes as journey down the anduin for replays,  though that quest had a great fun premise.

Just wait until you smash your head against The Morgul Vale. Never cursed so much or so loudly while playing LotR LCG... but at the time, I had overlooked the Tactomir, Loragorn, Spirfindel combo. Not sure if that line-up would make the quest easier?

Hmmm, I had another go this morning. I absolutely smashed the first two stages in 2 or 3 turns. Unexpected courage on Gimli, with him damaged and questing for a high amount while still being able to attack was awesome and Defender of Rammas out early was awesome defending. Also, I got Vassal of the Windlord out early too so his 3 attack was great for questing but without actually "attacking" so no discard of him haha!

But the third stage smashed me. I did not at all have enough actual questing power with only Gimli and Glorfindel having stats. Slowly crept 2 progress on the quest but locations were hard and also the enemies that do stuff if not "optinally" engaged when the stage doesnt allow it was hard ouch.

 

So I lost, actually bust threat but Glorfindel was only one alive (dammned Zealous Traiter killed 4 allies just by engaging) so was losing anyway.

 

Need to rethink for more questing power.

Where has Gandalf been this quest???

 

EDIT:

I looked through my deck. For Willpower I only have Glorfindel and Gimli (Heroes) Then 3x Gandalf and 2x Lorien Guide, no wonder I had no chance in the third stage.

My deck currently smashes 1st and 2nd stage (well it did last time) so I now need to see about adding willpower without taking away from its performance in the first two stages. Tricky.

So I deck tweaked. 

Sealed out some events that I realised I want playing due to conserving resource for allies. Also sealed out some tactics allies. Added in spirit questing allies. 

 

What happened. ,,, "the defending player discards his whole hand" wtf? ???

So I had 3 heroes out and nothing else other than unexpected cottage on gimli.  No hand, no cards and only one card draw per turn. Had no chance. Enemies built up faster than I could draw or play them. 

Squashed me.

 

I'm finding this scenario very hard. I'm feeling like this one is less about playing them game and more about deck design. If my deck isn't specifically tailored then I have no chance.  Doesn't feel to have as good balance as previous scenarios for balancing play against deck designing. Difficult. 

 

Am starting to feel nervous about the rest of this cycle. If I am not good enough at deck design, will I lose the fun of the game by the end of the 9 scenarios?  I'm only on scenario 1....

I wouldn't read too much into that particular loss. That shadow effect is just ridiculous, especially if it happens early on. As I recall there's only one copy of that card in the deck though, and as a treachery it's just "Search the deck for a location and add it to the staging area" so the odds of missing the ludicrous shadow are reasonable.

## 301 [Calvadur on April 16, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2735194)

Interessting, I always found that Peril in Pelagir is one of the quests you can beat consistently with an "all-around" deck (especially when compared with into Ithilien and Cair Andros), maybe slightly favouring combat.
The quest takes a good amount of Attack (or combat power in general), while demanding quite some willpower later. You should bring some cancellation and/or threat reduction, too. So as long as you mulligan for your combat cards and draw into your willpower later (so bring some card draw, too :D) you should be good. There are only really two scenarios, which are bad: 1st You don't start with good combat cards, what is just unlucky and shouldn't happen very often, 2nd you advance to the last stage without enough willpower, what is easily prevented by not picking up the scroll in stage 2 iirc, so just sit there as long as you can do the battle questing and than pick the scroll up once enough willpower hits the table.

I agree that the box quests are some of the hardest of the cycle. Most APs are either easier (e.g. Amon Din) or at least fairer designed.

Thanks all. 

Thing is, the enemies are just tough enough to need 2 characters (or turns) to kill (Gimli-aside) while also being damaging enough to kill most allies. There's also one out before you even start. 

I have all the things in my deck suggested by Calvadur, except card draw, but the scenarios stack things quickly and solo single handed takes time to build resource, so I've gotten overwhelmed. 

It including affects like, all your allies take 1 damage, that wipes of all my allies (not enough resource for tougher allies) or, discard all your cards, or discard all your resource, all are effects that cripple if I haven't managed to draw the cancellation cards yet or can afford them. 

 

I'm going to have another go with this deck, then I'm thinking of a deck redesign.  Few options mainly centred around different spheres.

I'd like to add leadership for celebrians stone, steward of gondor and faramir. Plus swap some cheap tactics allies for leadership allies to balance. Thinking maybe Dain as hero to further buff Gimli maybe (can't remember which stats he buffs). I'm also thinking that maybe I swap out spirit for lore. Go for some similar allies,  lose threat reduction but use lore aragorn,  not sure yet on this one though.

One more game with current deck, then swap out to include leadership.

 

 

Good to know there are some....Some easier quests in this cycle. Don't want the game to have outgrown my ability.

I threw a progression style (you play P-style, don't you?) deck (1 core, first two cycles, HoN and the first Hobbit Box) together and played 2 games. Did win both times, but have to admit I played a little sloppy and missed some points of archery damage from the Umbar Assassin during game, don't know if it would have made a difference.

Some (more) things I noticed that really make the game easier:
1) Spiritfindel - He's a total beast with Light, Rivendell-Blade (and Asfaloth, if you use lore) and kills almost everything without help (only Umbar assassin and Lossanach Bandit (if you only have 1 blade) being too tough). If you can ready him during your first round (cram is awesome) you can pull the thug out of the staging area before quest resolution :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

2) Discard the Scroll! - As soon as a pickpocket hits the table take it's attack undefended and place the (hopefully) 1 damage on the scroll-holder to attach it to the pickpocket. Only pick it up to advance to stage 3 once you are ready (and later to win the game, but that shouldn't be a problem) and then discard it with the same method (so better pick pickpocket with 3A's when revealed effect ;)). This will prevent some encounter card effects, the leaping fish's effect and the effect on stage 3b.

3) Clever attachment placement - The quest punishes ally armies quite heavy. Even though there are discard attachment shadows, powering up with attachments is much safer than allies (especially in stage 3). But don't put them on your highest threat cost hero, because of local trouble and don't put them on the hero, if it comes to the worst, you would sacrifice first. That is what can and did happen to me in game 2: Umbar Assassin without the option to optinally engage it. I was far below his engagement cost, but a zealous traitor wiped many allies out and I could only make 1-2 progress/round so I just let it stack up quickly and killed of Theodred (just to only draw leadership cards for the rest of the game...) and take it out, as most of my power was in Glorfindel.

If you want to take a look, this is the deck I used (don't mind the sideboard; this are just the cards I sorted out while cutting the deck down to 50 cards): http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/53297 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/53297]

Thanks some nice ideas, some I was incorporating and some not. Didnt think of the blade for Spiritfindel and have been using him to quest, but if he can kill enemies, its better to power up Gimli and let him quest (battle) and Glorfindel attack, good idea. I will look at cram too thanks.

Alex,

have you considered Boromir for Quest n.1? In any case, I had nightmares (before the nightmare decks arrived) at passing the quests in this box (and I still have to beat Cair Andros :/ )

Im actually using Boromir. He does great and Im glad I included him, though his defense isnt quite high enough (shield comes in later packs). To be fair though, my last deck smashed the first two stages but crashed on the third. Im now tweaking to try and get third without losing balance from firsttwo.

So difficult, I think the hardest scenario deck build I have played yet. But I think....think Im making progress.

## 307 [alexbobspoons on April 21, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2744560)

Soooooooooo close.

Died with 12 out of the 15 quest needed on the final phase so close.

Had been through the encounter deck once and a reshuffle so the defeated enemies were piling up again. 

Don't think I played any decision wrong so it's a loss due to the luck of the cards or my deck design. 

I can see how later cards adjust this so much,  Boromir died due to to many defends and the gondorian shield would totally negate that.

 

I did have very little questing in the last phase due to card draw but really if it's drawn more spirit allies then maybe my first two passes wouldn't have gone as well. 

Did lose 3 allies to that nasty ally damage engagement. 

 

Soooo close.

I don't think my deck is optimal for this quest at all but I do think it's the first draft of the deck that is actually possible to beat the quest, so before I do a full redesign with leadership,  I think I'll give this deck another go.

And another loss.

Getting a bit fed up.

For everything I build into the deck to combat the traitor or the collateral damage or the assassin or the etc etc the solutions just don't come out of my draw when the encounter cards reveal. It apart feels like the encounter is too cluttered with tricks.

 

I got to last stage again but by that time had lost so much as to be at a point I was just trying to survive rather than quest to victory.

I'd lost so many allies to do-1-damage.

Had gandalf all in hand but not enough resource. 

 

Sheesh

I think I'm going to get leadership into the mix for this.

## 309 [alexbobspoons on May 13, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2785225)

BEAT IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

I used Leadership (Theodred) Tactics (Gimli) and Spirit (Glorfindel)

I got Light of Valinor on Glorfindel quickly

Got Unexpected Courage on Gimli quickly

Had defender of Ramas out early

got a few allies out, Gimli damaged, got through first two stages.

High threat... but played 2 of Elronds Council (getting threat down and buffing questing) while playing Galdalf and escort from edoras and got Faramir out and quested in first turn of the final stage for 20-something and smashed it in one turn YEEEEEEEEAAAAAHHH!

 

Wow that was EPIC!!!

 

The first two stages were slow at first as less tactics mean harder to fight, but I was patient and Gimlis unexpected courage helped. Then when enemies were clear Gimli could quest highly using battle.

 

The things that made the difference this time were:

1: Good draw, yes unexpected courage and light of valinor as well as defender of ramas early were good luck. Gandalf and Faramir later were also good luck.

2: Theodred - His resource generation made a lot of things playable that otherwise may not have been.

3: Snowborn Scout was a little trooper as well, adding progress and chump blocking in usual fashion.

 

Wow after so much trouble this just anhialated the quest in the first go of my tri-sphere deck including Leadership into the mix. Im pretty shocked at how well this played out.

I do think that speed on this adventure is VERY important to avoid stuff stacking up.

 

YEEEEEEEAAAAAAHHHHHHHH !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

Glad thats over.

Seeing as this new deck had only one go at it, I may well play it another time without the pressure of needing to win before I go onto the next adventure.

Now that took some time

Yeehaw!

Thanks folks.

 

Ive heard Into Ithilien is harder than Peril even though its official rating is easier, then Siege is one of the hardest in the game ever.. eeek. Then I would move onto Battle of Laketown another hard reputation gosh its not an easy ride.

 

At least reputation says the 6 APs of the cycle are slightly easier and reputedly a lot of fun. Looking forward to managing to get to the cycle packs... wonder if I will manage it by Xmas

So I had another game.

Turn 1 all quested with intention of damage going on Gimli from thug.. Umbar Assassin comes out ****, no cards in play, heavy damage on Gimli. Thug and Assassin attack and  heavy damage Glorfindel and kill Theodred. Shadow cards discard all heroes resources and then players hand. End of turn 1 I have all  1 dead hero, 2 heroes almost dead and no cards in hand or in play.... no resources.... oh dear.

 

Turn 2 draw Elronds Council, no use now..  Both defend, Glorfindel dies and Gimli just survives. Turn 3 Gimli dies.

 

Total failure

If I wasnt okay to lose I would have stopped on turn 1 but I enjoy the game so knew I would lose but felt I would see how far I would get :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

But then if I want okay losing I wouldn't be playing this game huh :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

That Umbar Assassin is quite something. I love the comment somebody has made on his card at cardgamedb in the cards spoiler section, have a look if you want a chuckle.

Ps I always appreciate likes on my posts (have had quite a few from you thank you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ) as I see them as looking the post and is writing, not necessarily liking the outcome. But Your comment made me grin :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Pps for the epic effect of the result I was actually hoping to lose on turn 2 but realised I could keep Gimli alive so felt I should. I also realised afterwards that I could have taken the 3 damage plus the whole undefended attack on Theodred to limit the spread of the chaos, but hey ho. 

 

Ppps autocorrect changes Gimli to "gimp" it seems .... well how curious.

I had another go today, was doing pretty well and then the card that made me lose my hand lost my hand. Simply never got things back after that.

 

Moving on from this quest now. have to say I think its my least favourite of the whole game so far. I find many scenarios have what I think to be "tricks" whereby they arent just high damage or big enemies but they do game altering things like Umbar Assassin does, or the lose your hand, or the kill all allies (okay 1 damage to all allies) and in most quests you build solutions into your deck. But on this one I find there are too many different tricks. While I have solutions in my deck, its the luck of the draw if my solutions are not out yet when they appear and I dont have room for draw acceleration to the amount I would need for my trick counters.

Makes for a game where all is good and then you are sunk on the draw of one card.

Other scenarios can be frustrating but then after you build in trick-solutions all of a sudden they become more enjoyable and the pressure eases. With this quest, I beat it and did really well when I won, very much so... but... replays do not feel much fun. You are still waiting for the too-many-tricks and then bam! game over.

 

Its been good to have the challenge, but compared to other scenarios on re-plays, its just not that fun. Dissapointing really.

 

So, now to have an initial game of Into Ithilien.

Its reputation is hard and I am just going to use my current deck as a tester-run, so no hopes to win, just to see what happens. Then pack away to think about deck tweaks for next times game.

Hehe

So I just beat into Ithilien first go :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

It was hard and VERY tense but amazing fun.

 

I managed to keep Celador alive to miss stage 2 (I think death would have featured there otherwise) and this made a huge difference.

 

Gimli had 4 damage and unexpected courage so was going strong.

Theodred was a resource machine and also gained celebrians stone by the end.

Glorfindel managed to get Light of Valinor early and so was excellent.

I got  2 gandalfs in-hand plus a sneak attack. So  3 Gandalfs through the game helped loads. 2 lots of threat reduction and a 1 card draw.

Faramir (un-thematic I know) help masses with questing on the later stages.

2 lots of Elronds Council kept more threat low and added willpower in the later stages.

Defender of Ramas was excellent too.

Snowborn Scout did his bit, though also damaged Celador when he chump-blocked.

Escort from Edoras did a great questing service too, though added another damage to Celedor as he left play.

Celador died in the final stage.

Final threat was 32, I am very glad I didnt hit 37 to kick in "siege" on the quest card.

 

That was great :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] so tense but wow fun win.

Looking at my type above, I think I was VERY lucky with my card draw, very strong draws.

No spiders or Mumak encountered.... thats lucky!!

 

I really now need to play this quite a few times with win-stress removed as I know that then next quest has a rep as being one of the two hardest in the entire game run and just like I was with Escape From Dol Guldur, I am prepared to bypass that quest if I feel I am struggling too much. Few more games of Ithilien before I look at the biggie.

Good job with Ithilien! I remember struggling a lot with beating it. I finally won it with Beorn, Boromir and Aragorn (lore), using a lot of early attack to battle quest, and resetting threat with Aragorn on the last stage. Do you want some small advice on Cair Andros or do you want to give it a couple of tries first?

I assumed it would be harder as you would have stage two to tackle which would add time and thus more chance of may cats coming out of the deck (though without reading it I suspect that stage two would then skip stage 3 and thus be equal anyway) though stage two I suspect is also a siege or battle thus making the southron company more difficult. Also Celador as a free character helped me. 

 

Then again, if a deck is built for battle/siege questing, I can see where stage 2 might be easier than stage 3. I was lucky to have Gandalf,  Faramir, light of valinor etc all adding to willpower questing.

Real life being busy. 

Went away and took games but didn't get to a LotR game. Watched a lot of TV,  played some D&D boardgame and Marvel Legendary.

This weekend is Descent2 and my new DungeonQuest,  but if I have more time I will have another pop at Into Ithilien and write up. 

 

I really appreciate the interest in my writings thank you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'll play more soon,  just get so busy. 

 

EDIT: on checking, before I went away I did get another Ithilien game in but it looks like my write up didn't post,  but I did type it. Essentially I got stuffed in stage 2 by the blocking wargs chain-surging and ending in the Mumak,  disaster. Wasn't doing too bad until that point. It all just went bang really quickly. Masacre!

Wargs surging can be devastating. I already loose on turn one with three of this in a row. I just loose my ally that I just pay and one hero O_o. I don't know if the problem is still printed in recent version but beware: wargs surging is no longer get shuffled back in the encounter deck. Mumak is also really difficult. I try to avoid them of just calculate for block but almost never kill one in solo mode, 4 turns is too long.

Good luck for your next try!

Another game at Into Ithilien.

Same deck.

Started slowly, had a bit of a clogged staging area but managed to get through bit by bit. Gimli was fully wounded but Glorfindel got light of valinor. A sneak attack Gandalf helped. Was a slow slog and the round that I completed stage1 Celador died, so my first go at the standard stage2.

This also was a long slog as I had been aiming for using willpower and so the siege keyword was a pain. I had 3 Elronds Council in hand but didnt want to lower threat without using the willpower gain.

I slogged through, playing a standard Gandalf to boost defense as I was low on defense, but Defender of Ramas came to my aid as a solid 4. Nasty Morgul Spider attacked but I defended with Gondorian Spearman and quick-strike with Gimli to dispatch it. I just missed out with 8 progress but the followig turn the encounter card was a location so managed to get to stage 4, though I had Southron Company engaged.

 

Right!! Willpower now huh. My threat was 36 so only 1 away from siege but I played all 3 Ellronds Councils for a 3WP gain and a threat lower of total 9 haha.

I then played out another Gandalf onto the table, exhaused Faramir for his WP bonus and then quested with everybody. My total WP was about 21 and so it handled the 1 threat of another Southron Company and blitzed the 15 progress needed to win HAHA! Victory!

 

So thats 2 wins against Into Ithilien out of 3 games thats a pretty healthy score. Quite pleased with my deck. However I didnt see a single Blocking Warg or the Mumak so again I was lucky on the card draw.

 

I think now I will grit my teeth and the next game will be the Siege of Cair Andros. Bit concerned I will be stuck on this for ages until I can get onto other quests, we will see. I will keep the same deck for the first test of it though and see what happens :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Wow man, 2/3, good for you.

I think I struggled a lot more due to reshuffling surging Blocking Wargs back into the deck (anyone know when that was first errataed?).

Although Siege of Cair Andros is hard, it was one of my favourite quests of the deluxe + cycle. Truly epic quest.

My game 2 featured Wargs and it just smashed me to bits. The first game I only had 1 and the current game was zero. So I do think lucky draws really!

 

Worried about being stuck on Siege and not enjoying it. Pelargir was so hard for me I started to not enjoy as much, I hope Siege isnt the same.

I can't really say no worries, but Cair Andros is a much more predictable quest and in my opinion limits the decks that match up well against it much more than Pelagir does. For me that makes the quest less fun and interessting than Pelagir, which I played many times more than Cair Andros. But it also means that it isn't that hard to come up with a decent deck to grind out a win.

To me Cair Andros in more difficult and specific since siege is often more difficult to achieve that quest in battle or with will. Plus I have hard time at the beginning to figure what are the best options between save the locations or let a lot of attack undefended. But it is in the same difficult range than into Ithilien (probably a little bit easier) so you can beat it ;).

## 333 [alexbobspoons on June 18, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2841892)

So first go at Siege, lost massively. To be honest also did not enjoy it. That's not to say I won't enjoy it with a better deck, but with this feel no fun at all, very disappointed. 

 

At no point ever did I have enough defense to beat the threat in the staging area, so that mounted. 

Trying to quest to reduce the questing failure meant I didn't have enough defenders to core with the encounter decks monsters which were a LOT. So I took combat damage or lost allies every turn. 

 

There was never anybody left to actually make a meaningful attack on the monsters,  so they built up in the engagement area until they killed everyone. 

 

While I could have played it differently,  I never felt a different play would have worked. Every turn felt doomed and that I had no good option.  I was just wasting time until defeat. 

 

It wasn't fun because I never felt I had tactical options,  I felt I was losing with no effective plays available at any point for the whole game. Can't say this scenario felt well designed as it felt futile while other losing scenarios have still felt fun with a chance, I never felt I had a chance. 

 

This may be a different story with a specific designed deck,  time will tell. 

 

I feel I need a deck with heavy defense because without that I had nothing. 

Big on tactics, maybe leadership. 

Full de c know redesign is in order. Very combat/defense orientated,  which obviously fits the theme. 

Will a tailored deck make this scenario fun?  Dunno yet.  Am I capable of designing something to cope with it?  Dunno that either.

Your speech don't seem to fit with with this scenario. What don't you let undefended attack and go to stage 2 so you can now quest with will and keep strong defender/attacker to fight? It probably wasn't enought (since you reveal 2 cards per turn at stage 2) but can be your only way left when you are on the way to loose everything.

IF I understood it correctly, he wasn't able to finish stage 1 or make progress at any time, so it didn't matter if or which locations were destroyed. But it's indeed a viable strategy to not even try to save the locations and use their "hitpoints" as a buffer to set up for all 5 stages. 

I had the most success myself with a mono tactics deck that features close to zero willpower. Only important thing is to get stage two out of the game as there's no way to win willpower questing against two cards per turn. If you draw enough eagles, defenders of rammas it's possible to handle combat and clear the locations.

Don't be to frustrated I don't think anyone ever was able to come close to beating this quest when going in blind with a non-specific deck. The encounter deck and quest design just punish various things way to hard...

If there is no more battleground location in play you go immediately to the stage 2, that why I say you can let attack undefended if defense is too hard to manage at the moment. You will have to face defense later so this is not perfect at all but can still delay defeat and may be within this two turns a miracle can happens :).

I too found that the best deck for this scenario is mono tactics with heavy defence. There are couple of cards that punish you for having multiple spheres and tactics has a lot of defence to take care of questing. I think it's best to just don't care about willpower when building you deck. You only need it at stage 2, so if you can clear the first location the scenario isn't that hard. Boromir, Beregond, Gimli, Beorn are all good against this quest, and of course a lot of eagles/defenders of rammas, who siege quest for 4 while costing only 2

## 339 [alexbobspoons on June 19, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2843327)

Just to add,  I didn't get any progress on the quest card and the final battleground location was still in play when i died, thus was on stage 1 the whole time. 

Taking undefended would indeed have advanced me but seeing as I did this blind I wasnt taking tactical decisions I was playing to test the scenario and be surprised by its contents. So not seeing what other stages have means I wasnt able to plan for them.  I had/have no idea what later stages need in terms of questing/siege/battle. Paying it blind you just try to do the best you can on what the stage card says. 

 

Thanks for all the advice and ideas folks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Curious why envoy of pelargir?  Seems 2 cost to gain 1 back. So is it simply a 1 cost chump block?

It is a very useful cards when it can also quest and reorganize resource among heroes. Since it can't be any of this I don't get either the point. Good luck for you're next try. This deluxe box make me totally rethink my way to build decks (since I always build my deck to beat all the scenario it is very hard to manage those one).

The Envoy is a very good ally. For 1 cost you get someone that can quest, attack, or chump-block, and at the same time provide resource smoothing. He appears in many of my decks.

As long as there are no effects in the quest that severely punish you for losing a character, I'd sooner put him in a solo deck than Feint (why not both?).

Thats a great point thank you. Feint is one use and gone so Envoy as a blocker is just as good yet has the option of those other aspects, very good point thanks.

In this scenario it can't quest most of the time nor resource smoothing :/. This aside it is also the ally I play the most (and may be 2 times more than the second one). But I recommend to play them both because blocking with an ally can damage a lot battlefield location in play because of the shadow cards. You want to use it to attack.

So I designed a deck based HEAVILLY on Seastans build (having read the article with great interest, I then find that despite what Yoda says, it's really difficult to unlearn what you have learned..)

 

Gave it a go. 

 

First two turns encounter cards were masters malice, ouch!!!

Didn't do to badly but I suffered from shadow-card-stacking making some enemies hit for about 10.. deal another shadow, deal two more shadows etc..

And eventually lost. Fairly uneventful other than just continued slog.

I did enjoy it though, was a much better shot at the scenario.

I found with this quest I lost a lot in the first couple turns (counting losing the Banks as a loss), but if I made it past those turns I had a decent shot at winning. It can be frustrating, but at least you don't have to keep devoting an hour to the game only to lose at the end.

I tend to carry on with the game regardless, so this lasted 30mins before I finally went down but in honesty I felt I was wasting my time all the play. Did not enjoy it, which is not a nice feeling with this game. Right now feeling very frustrated at how a mechanic can do that without much bad-choice from me, Putting the game away for the night after only one play.

Got to say, overall not impressed with the HoN deluxe box. Its difficulty is above that I would expect from a standard game and if I had been buying progressively on-release this may well have finished my involvement with the game. As it is, I know good stuff is ahead, but not happy with my play at the moment.

 

Peril in Pelargir was on the whole not great fun, possibly my worse quest to-date. Into Ithilien I surprisingly didnt mind but I can see where it frustrates.  Siege is just frustrating.

Im sure that "IF" I master this quest it will all be a different story, but right now its really hard to get enthusiasm to play it :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] hate to be a downer but as a non-expert player this box really is a disappointment. Its the kind of difficulty Id expect from a hard-mode (Nightmare?) not a standard off the shelf game.

 

Feels like a waste of time this evening. When I started the game at core, losing was still huge fun for the enjoyment of the game. This quest, losing isnt fun its frustrating. For me presonally, bad design :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Totally with you Alexbob. This box did not mesh with my partner's and my playstyle at all at the time, so we quit playing the game for a month. It was Cair Andros that did it for us, too--the frustration sort of built up throughout the box and then having Cair Andros as the capstone felt like a slap in the face. We eventually came back to it with two mono-Tactics decks, crushed it, rolled our eyes, and moved on.

There's definitely light at the end of the tunnel--the Against the Shadow cycle isn't nearly as hard as the Heirs of Numenor box, and it has a few real gems of quests in there. The Morgul Vale is pretty tough, but somehow it's easier to accept since it's at the end of the cycle rather than the beginning. Even so, it's not as frustrating as Seige of Cair Andros, in my opinion.

If you get too frustrated, you can just skip it and come back to it later. I'm a completionist too, but I won't tell anyone if you don't. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

As another newbie, I'm rooting for you alexbobspoons! I'm still in Dwarrowdelf and I'm a little nervous about reaching HoN based on its fearsome reputation. It sounds like there were some serious balance problems with the design of that cycle. It is reassuring to know that Caleb managed to strike a better balance with the sagas and subsequent cycles.

Back to this time there was no nightmare or easy mode. They probably want to make everyone happy at the same time so they make quest with different challenge (some easy, some medium and some hard). Sound like a smart idea. But putting three hard scenario on the same box is pretty hard and that's the problem with heirs of numenor. To my own I found those quests very cool, even back to this time. Even when I start losing ten times in a row. After defeat them with regularity, with a deck who also stand very well against other quest, I really found myself having mastered LoTR in a whole new level :).

Hmm interesting.

So I made a totally fresh deck, mono tactics.

Beregond, Gimli and Thalin

I still lost, but I got all the way to the final stage. Also, I lost Gimli VERY early in the game he did almost nothing, it was a shadow-card-multiplier again where the total hit got up to about 9 sheesh.

I also had to suffer the Mumak.

Part of me feels that if I had managed to keep Gimli, his extra resources plus battling would have made a big difference. On the final stage we were in battle and I simply didnt have the axes to get any progress on it. If Gimli was still about I would have used my ciradel plate on him (still unused at end of game and Gimlis resource would have paid for it) and been able to quest-crazy with him, which would have cleared the quest in two turns (added to what I was already questing) and by defenders were enough that they all chump blocked until I dies on the third turn.

Soooooo, had I not lost Gimli early-days (had...if...possible etc yes I know...) then there is a chance the numbers would have worked on this quest and I may have beaten it.

 

So Hmmm, is this mono tactics deck capable of beating the rotten quest and get me onto other quests? Dunno.

 

But the main thing here is that I actually enjoyed it! I felt I had a chance even after losing Gimli and it didnt feel futile and disconnected. This I am very happy about as right now I am curious as to what the next game will bring and THATS back to where I want to be with this game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Glad to hear that. Having access to the progression card pool, I'd say mono tactics is the way to go and knowing the cards of the encounter deck, I am convinced that is what the designers had in mind when designing the quest.

Quest is defenitly beatable with a mono tactics deck, a little more luck (yeah, kind of sad that the encounter deck still can simply crush you bringing out Mumaks, shadow card chains or simpely destroy specific locations without anything to do against it) and you can move on. As others have said the rest of the cycle is way more "balanced".

I do think I'm in with a shout at this now if I make the right choices and with a LOT of luck.

I'm almost tempted to splash in shadow cancellation with a song. Few tries mono tactics first.

I squeaked out a few progression style victories with Legolas, Boromir (T) and Beregond.

Blade of Gondolin x2 on Legolas can be really helpful in this quest, especially on that stage where heroes strong in battle/siege questing are useless due to the need for conventional Will questing. And mono Tactics neutralizes The Master's Malice.

Beat it beat it beat it beat it yes yes yes yes! 

Errrr. .. I er,  I beat it .

One handed solo tactics.

Same deck as before. Gimli,  Beregond and Thalin. 

 

Good game, mumak passed as a shadow card. 

Cleared first two locations but lost the citadel however staying in siege worked better for me. 

Game went to plan though balancing questing attacking and defending was a difficult call. 

I got a defender of rammas out on turn 1 which helped. Beorn came out fairly quickly too and that helped. 

Archery hit me a few times but it buffed Gimli so he could attack. Lieutenant of mordor was tricky but Gimli and Beorn finished him.  Khazad khazad was a useful card too,  played two. 

Last phase I played a Gandalf. Everybody quested in a panic. Orc war camp came out for 5 threat and I had quested at 20 and needed 15 progress, win !!!!!!!

 

Awesome. 

Maybe play another for fun before moving on. Feel happier now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] less frustrated!

Had another go and lost but I gave it a good shot. 

Went down in stage 4

Didn't clear properly so stage 3 stayed in the deck and the willpower stumped me, managed to clear it with Gimli and Gandalf but it took a lot out of me.  The Mumak was in play too so I was losing a lot of allies to chumping. 

By stage 4 I didn't have enough cards out left to defend attack and quest so I slowly got ground down. 

 

Was a good fight, deck worked well even at a fail so it wasn't frustrating. 

 

Now onto battle of laketown (gulp) had a quick look and woah it looks hard. Mono tactics had no willpower so no point having a test go, need to design a deck that can quest. Thinking tactics/spirit as a start idea to test it. 

Gosh I'm waiting for the second hobbit box after this scenario for a breather after all these so hard quests.

Hmm I'm wondering if tactics/leadership might be better. Resource acceleration, celebrant stone, faramir ally. Might get better results from leadership than spirit. Also snowborne scout.

2 tactics 1 leadership hero maybe. 

 

Edit:

But then there are cancellation effects needed. Threat reduction and big defending needed. ..hmm.  maybe trisphere spirit/tactics/leadership I might even try and splash in healing. This is going to take some thinking about before I even play.

Battle of Lake-Town requires a whole other mindset/deck-building strategy to win. Ask if/when you get stumped.

Still one of my favourite quests... but was extremely frustrating until I figured out what had to be done.

Good luck!

Its quite impressive how tastes might differ... For me, Into Ithilien and Siege of Cair Andros are amongst my favorite quests. I also enjoy Journey to Rhosgobel, another quest which is overall disliked by many players

## 366 [alexbobspoons on July 28, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2901639)

Firstly,  I like rhosgobel too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] also holds of Emin muin which many hate. 

 

Secondly I had a game of Laketown. 

 

Girls for attack, frodo for defending smaug,  glorfindel for questing and multi use.

Spirit for cancellation cards and threat reduction with added bonuses of unexpected courage and similar stuff. Valinor etc

OHAUH gandalf instead of core

Tactics for citadel plate, dwarowdelf axe etc.

Dwarven mail for frodo

 

All seemed a good idea. 

Smashed!!

 

The big smaug who makes an immediate attack came out, so frodo defended but threat rose. Then in the same turn, different phase (combat) smaug attacks again, frodo takes it undefended, so threat zooms more, shadow card added more hits and if I remember right another attack. 

Devastating.

I was questing very slowly add I didn't get any allies out, so only made about 6 progress while smaug was brutal. Bust 50 that before I could do anything good or get threat reduction going. Brutal.

 

I did consider lore aragorn to reset threat but thought I needed spirit cards and resource more. I may add him with healing and go trisphere after another go with the deck as is. 

 

Burning damage and damage on Laketown were no bother, it was questing and damage soaking that were problems. 

 

Fun though.

Into Ithilien and Defense of Cair Andros was my two favorite quest until recently. They bring the game in a new whole level. This is the moment the game came to maturity. From now I felt every quest on cycle 1 and 2 (and especially the 2) is annoying. But since they even create more sophisticated dynamics. Time counter was brilliant. It take me time to realise how it give rythm to the game but it became my favorite cycle more than one year ago. Cycle 5 have a lot of great thing too and may be I will realize how great it is soon too.

As rhosgobel and Emyn Mul are both not on the two first cycle you already know what I'm thinking about them ^^.

But we were talking about laketown. I got this quest pretty soon after it release and I play it numberous times. Here what I get:

1- Questing is very important. Every turn can set you closer to the defeat because of the burning of laketown and because you will have to sacrifice allies for Smaug;

2- Watch your threat. You have to be under 35, and under 30 is even better. If you can let Smaug in the staging area and only get the immediate attack of the smalest everything gonna be cool, as you have a LOT of willpower.

3- Watch for the shadow who deal 1 damage on every ally. It is very painful.

4- Having weapons seem useless. You only need to attack at the end so it will not serve until then. Armure plate allow you to block well with the hero attached to him? I doubt so. Play a lof of allies at small cost with willpower. And get support from who you can to kill Smaug at the end, but the first step is to survive at him first.

5- Of course it is useless to have anything that target enemies since all the Smaug are immunized.

6- Keep going! This one was really hard to defeat for me at this time. Good luck

Thanks for that much appreciated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I had considered blocking with chumps but thought I would run out of allies and thus Frodo would be better at the blocking, not sure if that was a good idea yet.

Also, my idea for damage on Smaug was that I would likely lose allies before final phase and not have enough left for damage, so as a result, get Gimli with enough damage on him with a citadel plate and a Dwarrowdelf axe to be doing serious high damage and then double-whammy with a Khazad! Khazad! card to take most (not all) off Smaug in a single turn once I get into the final stage. (Bearing in mind all these cards are played on the hero, not the target, so Smaug wouldnt be immune to any of this).

 

At this point, my one go at the quest skyrocketed the threat, so maybe Frodo blocking was a poor idea, or maybe its just that I didnt get my threat reduction into play :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Maybe I should have swapped Gandalfs for core to reduce threat.

So too much threat not enough questing was the main issue in my first go.

Will give the same deck another try before deciding properly what goes wrong and how to tweak/change it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The best things is to not have to blocked at all. For that you need to be at small threat. It is impossible with your frodo strategy.

Why would khazad! khazad! will be better than ally? Allies don't die if you care enough. You can cancel the shadow who deal 1 damage on each. Get allies so you can both quest on early game and attack on end game.

And that may me think that tactics do pretty poorly in this adventures because it don't have any cards for doing this. In solo I always found that tactics was really weak compared to other spheres. I just take a look and none of my 11 best solo decks use tactics, even if five of them are tri-sphere. For comparison I got 9 deck for each others spheres.

Only because if Gimli gets to do someing like 11 attack, that's high damage against smaug if the objective card reduces his defense, so being able to do the same amount of damage with a single card at zero cost is pretty good. 

To get allies out of equal damage is a lot of resource and then there's the trick of keeping them alive long enough. If Smaug engages that's one ally gone. Most heroes are around 10 cost so keeping the threat really down can be hard. Glorfinfel is a good bet but unless valinor goes on him, he is raising threat every quest phase. I'm also not sure a chunk of good questing spirit allies can do enough damage thigh they would quest well.

I do like your idea though and it has obviously worked for you! Maybe I should look at leadership for some allies as maybe they will balance questing with attacking :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Why did you say "If Smaug engages that's one ally gone"? That mean you sacrifice the ally on the attack? So if you have khazad! khazad! instead you just lost a hero (because you don't have any option that loose that ally)?

Few heroes are at 10 cost or more. Except in tactics (did I ever mention that I don't like this sphere in solo ? :p). Yes for example Glorfindel for to quest at 3 every turn and have a low threat. Play 3 light of valinor, regular drawing cards and you will have it soon and be able to attack for 3 when needed.

You can also go for a dwarf deck with Dain, so allies can either quest or attack.

Elrond/vilya is as always a good deck

Probably even secrecy can make it out with Timely Aid, big allies and a very good tale

Your strategy of building up Gimli as a heavily armoured dragon slaying machine is a sound one, Alex. It worked for me. And I seem to recall winning that quest repeatedly with relatively few allies. 

## 373 [Authraw on July 30, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=2905635)

Every time I have beat this quest, I used Frodo. Keeping threat low in the early game was really important, though, so that the only thing I had to worry about was the Smaug that makes an immediate attack. I believe I used Dunedain Warnings and a Hobbit Cloak to buff Frodo's defense as much as possible to buy myself more time. Once my threat inevitably got too high, I would sprint to the finish, hopefully having built up enough forces by then to take Smaug down.

I never played it progression-style, though, so I don't know how many cards I was relying on that you haven't added to your collection yet.

Only because khazad khazad is just one card and zero cost, I would still have allies in play as well, but paying for allies and losing them to Smaug would be false economy (if threat too high) hence why I aimed to use Frodo and avoid losing too much to Smaug.

Glorfindel is already in my deck as is Valinor, so that aimes to keep my starting threat down some.

I can certainly see the benefit of lots of allies and dont think I yet have enough in my deck.

Still going to play another game with current deck just to test its strengths and weaknesses :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 

 

Thanks for all the good advice to everyone.

Looking back at my sheets, looks like I only used Gimli when playing 2-handed.

Seems I beat the quest solo progression using Frodo, Aragorn (L) and Glorfindel (S)... but lost far more than I won, and that was the only lineup I tried.  It's been over 2 years since I last played Lake-Town... I think either Aragorn (L) or Glorfindel (S), with Frodo and Gimli might also work solo.

Another play. Lost.

The tactics seem to be working okay, not great and I bust threat. I hadnt got past stage 1 but had good progress and about 4 victory points.

 

I suffered from not getting Valinor on Glorfindel so he was expensive. Also, Gandalf(Hobbit) didnt seem worth his cost without the when-played effects as all he did was quest, so his ability didnt help (going to swap out for core).

Also, Northern Tracker and Lorien Guide came out and are expensive but didnt play well as there werent many locations in play at that point. So they didnt pay for themselves.

 

I think the theory is sound but not the best hand. Going to swap out Galdalf as I could really have done with the threat reduction of core (or card draw) then play another game later :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Its really hard, and its tiring having so many hard quests in a row after HoN box, but its not as frustrating as HoN. If I can just get past this quest I am onto Hobbit-box-2 before the HoN-Cycle so should be a little breather. Just need to master this one :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

and another game and smashed again.

 

Not one turn did I have enough possibility at all to beat the threat in the staging area, not one single turn. It was still fun but nothing I could do at any turn.

 

I am going to redesign my deck. I have been thinking that Gimli is doing very little and IF I were to get to final combat, it would be quite difficult to get him damaged enough to fight without actually killing him. There is only the Dragon causing damage and he causes quite a bit which also cannot be relied on due to the many shadow effects. Gimli powered up and then playing Khazad Khazad  would be such massive damage but can I actually get him injured enough without being dead? Whereas I am really struggling to quest well even with spirit as two heroes. No point having a good end-game plan if I cant get there.

So.. I have two main thoughts.

1: I remove tactics completely and replace with either Leadership (celebrians stone, steward of gondor, faramir and then loads of allies) or Lore (threat-reset-Aragorn plus loads of allies)

then the next thought:

2: Is Frodo worth keeping for the Dragon attacks rather than a chump blocker? Do I replace him with Eowyn to quest hard?

 

Build up the allies to quest and/or block and then hopefully have enough peoples to battle Smaug if I get to the end.

I think that playing both Frodo and lore-reset can be smart.

But if you don't play Frodo you must stay low on threat. The threat trouble is about not being engage so only get down one time with aragorn when you reach 35 (so you can't anymore escape from 2 out 3 dragon) is not enough. If you planned to be engaged with the dragon and sacrifice an ally each turn give up, there is no way you can win this ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png].

Just had another game WOW!

Lost, but close.

I redesigned with Leadership in place of Tactics. Thorin as hero.

It was a battle all the way, really hard. Got Valinor and Celebrian and Steward of Gondor on Glorfindel. Got Unexpected Courage on both Thorin and Frodo.

 

Went really well but all a battle. Got a good few allies out but the 1-damage treachery kept thinning them out.

 

Got all the way to then end and killed Smaug, by this time Frodo was dead. Victory points: 30, Damage on Laketown: 33 arrgghh lost. The last few turns Laketown had taken bad overspill damage as Frodo had dies and thus chump blockers were left to defend. But it was so close.

If I had got a threat reduction out one or two turns earlier, Frodo would have survived as threat wouldnt have been too high to avoid saving him. One less "burn" damage card also would have made the difference. So it was soooooooooooo close, could have been a win.

 

I was lucky with the good cards I got onto the heroes, but it still played well and hard. Will stick with this deck for another try next time.

Another big loss, never got off the ground really. 

Hardly ever had enough willpower to beat threat the whole game. Those 1 damage treachery and shadow cards really bashed my allies. My deck had cancellation but it just didn't come out. 

I just trod water in stage 1 the whole time until my that busy from frodo taking dragon attacks. 

Hard game.

and another play.

Loss

Long game but struggled all the way. Almost completed stage 1 before threat bust.

Never got Valinor on Glorfindel so threat was rising quickly. Tried to keep under control but nope.

Too much damage and not enough questing progress.

 

Very hard.

I know this is intended as a hard quest, but after playing the 3 HoN quests and then this, 4 of the hardest quests I have ever played is tough going. I can see why the internet records a large group of players quitting the game at this point in its history, there just doesnt seem much let-up. Im still enjoying it, but not as much as I used to. Right now, every card from the decks seems crucial, every decision a game-breaker. The win margin seems so slight and so dependant on draw, the relaxed fun of the game isnt there in these scenarios for me.

In one sense thats the way it SHOULD be in a dragon-attacked town, so its well designed, BUT I  think released at a bad time. 4 hard quests in a row is simply soul-sapping. Either Laketown would have been better a little later, or HoN deserved one or two easier quests for its box I think.

 

I am going to stick with this scenario for now, I have hopes (low) to beat, but I think its days are numbered before I throw in the towel and move on (So far Dol Guldur is the only time I have done that). This saddens me, but I would rather keep enjoying my game then end up run down. The game needs to be challengin, but fun too. For me these 4 quests back-to-back are too brutal. I couldnt even dream to think of a thematic deck for these.

 

Ill carry on with my current deck as I think its capable of defeating the scenario, but I do have a side-though that I might try. Leadership and Lore (not sure if I would have enough questing) so that I could get Gloin with citadel plate to defend the dragon without raising threat.. Then Lore healers to get him back healthy (all the while generating big resource to get extra cards into play). Plate is expensive and this relies on getting out healer cards while maintaining a good questing score, so I dont know if it can work at all. Its just an initial thought.

Another loss.

Poor from the start

Turn one I got two allies out which drained my resources, then the first card killed them with no cancellation. So my hand was badly depleted and resources were zero.  From there I grew into location-lock and lost out to threat eventually.

Not great, not so much fun either.

 

Im beginning to see my current deck is far too reliant on draw luck and the first go with it that almost won was far too lucky. I need to redesign my deck :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

I do not feel like moving on yet, but this run of hard quests is also not making me want to play numerous games in a row. Its too hard work. Feels like losing from the start and hoping for some luck to land.

 

Ill take a break from it and think about a deck redesign. So far my big problems are questing high and threat. I may use Lore Aragorn to try help the threat. As for questing, well thats a difficult one. My location allies havent been able to avoid location lock because of the Wharf card that keeps nullifying them, so they are expensive for what they are. I think try for more allies with raw questing power if I can.

Ive had enough and am throwing in the towel.

After a long break to clear my head I had a game at Laketown today with a new deck and didnt even get a single progress. It simply was not fun. Right now I am no longer actually enjoying the game as I just cannot figure out this scenario for my play and its become a chore for me as it is too hard for my abilities. If I keep going I will ruin my enjoyment of the game completely so now is the time to put aside Laketown and move on.

 

I will next go to On The Doorstep as this appears to be next release before the Stewards Fear. Hopefully I will have a better time at that. Maybe I will return to Laketown in the future with a bigger cardpool like I plan to do someday for Escape From Dol Guldur.

 

Defeated.

I support that. Lake-town requires specific deck building and can be frustrating even with proper deck. What worries me is that you go straight into On the Doorstep, which contains at least one quest annoying for similar reasons.

As my play is progression, it seems On The Doorstep is next so thats the one I grabbed. If I get frustration with one I will move on again as I want to keep enjoying this game.

 

As for Laketown, I will come back to it one day but for now its stopped being fun and thats when to move on.

 

For the first quest of OTD I have picked one of the suggested decks from the instructions, which I think will be awful. But its a starting point for me to see where the scenario goes before deck building again.

On the doorstep is next for me too, I plan to double hand it and use both suggested decks.  I'm not good enough at the game to true solo it.  I think.

I don't think I am good at the game but so far solo single handed only laketown and dol guldur have beaten me. Sometimes it's just trial and error.

I found the previous hobbit suggested decks awful so am expecting the same and just see if as a starting point really. 

Best of luck

Played a game of spiders and flies with the tactics and lore deck. Did well got to stage 4 before smashed. 

Enjoyed it! 

Don't think the decks worked well at all I played very few good cards. Bilbo got his ring thigh and that helped a lot. 

So far, I think key things look to be good defending, good attacking, good questing. Some cancellation would be nice. 

Also, maybe powering up individual hero's would be better than multiple allies due to then having less unconscious to fix. But then less to soak poison.

Well have a deck tweak before another go. Add more tactics combat tricks to shift spiders fast, then some questing cards. Might swap lore for spirit for questing, cancellation and threat reduction. Also defender of ramas is needed :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Was nice to enjoy losing a quest again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

In spider of flies you need to be a little bit lucky because when your entire board felt unconscious you can't deal well with enemies so if two enemies arrive right after you will die in almost every case or any deck.

In multiplayer I think that the key is to think in advance about the deck who will own Frodo when passing to the split stage. It must be the deck with good heroes, and absolutely not the deck with a lot of allies (who need to smashed tons of spider outside, waiting for him). A deck with tactics is often good with that (good heroes, not that much allies, event that help).

Just wanted to say I've really enjoyed reading the past 16 pages of your time with the game. I'm just coming back in myself and am also doing progression style. I first got the game about two years ago and played a ton of the core set, then eventually picked up the first cycle. Life happened and I only got through two of the AP's before having to set the game aside for a time. I'm looking forward to finally finishing off the first cycle and getting into the dwarves. Eventually I hope to have as complete a collection as you!

Yay I had a great game today after big break.

I went to my box and found my desk was in bits following previous redesign thoughts, so looked at my last bits here and designed a new deck on my notes. 

Double tactics with single spirit. Gimli,  Legolas and Glorfindel (s)

Spirit I included threat reduction, cancellations, light of valinor,  unexpected courage and arwen undomiel.  Tactics I went combat orientated. Plus gandalf etc

 

It went really well. First draw I had valinor and bilbos ring. Great. Very lucky start.

Early on I got citadel plate onto gimli,  wow he soaked poison. Got stuck when the great Web location meant we couldn't quest to remove location lock but arwen was drawn and played and we slowly removed it as she tipped the balance. That was a tough point. Unexpected courage went on gimli and things went good then.

From then on it was mainly combat and questing

Managed to quest through stage 3 and 4 to a win.

Stage 3 was the most difficult. At first because of unconsciousness but then later because even with all characters conscious,  the Web location plus lots of poison meant I couldn't quest enough to clear the location (until arwen) so it was worrying at that point.

But it came good. Great game and close win. 

Gandalf never appeared (slacker). Defender of Ramas was a trooper, Arwen saved my bacon, citadel plate on gimli was awesome.

 

Great game, enjoyed. I think I will use this deck a few times on this scenario for fun now before moving on to the next scenario.

 

A triumphant return :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Oh for goodness sake.

 

I had a game today of spiders and flies with my winning deck slightly tweaked.

It was going excellently but then on stage 3 everybody but Bilbo goes unconsious (thus losing poison) leaving Bilbo the only one conscious and as it happens with 1 poison.

First card out of the encounter deck is Crazy Cob which due to the 1 poison immediately attacks Bilbo with nothing I can do and Bilbo is dead.

 

Argh what a way to lose :(

 

Makes me think its not worth committing Bilbo to early quests so that he doesnt get poison for this eventuality, but then until stage 3 hes pretty useless in that case.

 

Grrr

PLayed another game and got squashed by Bilbo not readying people fast enough with the big spiders coming out of the deck.

Moving onto The Lonely Mountain for my next game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] will play first with my current deck before deciding if any tweaking/changing is needed.

Looking at your last post in this thread which was months ago, you seem to have a problem with that quest 😂

No, just havent played in months.

I did beat the quest and was just still playing it a few times before moving on and I felt the next enjoyment would be in a new quest :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So another game and this time the new quest (Lonely Mountain I think)

Got to stage 3 before busting threat.

Was quite fun. Tricky one. I struggled to quest a lot as targets were very high in staging. Didnt do much combat but didnt really need it, defending was irrelevant due to Smaugs big attack levels when he had a pop at me.

I also struggled for resources. Was dual sphere with Tactics and Spirit. Glorfindel was good, Gimli was okay and Legolas useless. Need to swap Legolas for a better quester.

Not sure how I would fare against damaging Smaug but next game will simply need much more questing somehow. Might bring in Eowyn to pair with Glorfindel. More revealed-cancellation would have been good too!!

Fun tricky quest so far.

Had a think.

Definitely thinking:

More questing

More cancellation

More resources

More chump-blocking (or threat reduction to let Bilbo block)

Combat not seeming that important overall, though do need a bit

## 406 [alexbobspoons on December 28, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=3577035)

New deck and two losing games.

Swapped out Legolas for Aragorn.

Celebrians, Steward, sneak etc

Game 1: Worked well until Smaug did a chain surge attack and essentially killed everyone. Bang.

Game 2: Went downhill early as some surges tied up people and I lost Aragorn. Sadly then I just seemed to draw leadership cards and couldnt play them, so I had a useless hand and very little in play, which lead to location-lock which then lead to threat busting.

 

Not seeing tactics doing much yet other than chump blocking. Thinking of swapping tactics out for a second Leadership or Spirit hero. Then swapping its cards in the deck for various chump blockers of the other spheres. Will have a think on this one.

Redesigned deck removing tactics. Added Eowyn and more of both spirit and leadership cards.

 

Beat it yay!!

 

Kinda difficult. Surged through questing, Faramir invaluable, celebrians, eowyn, glorfindel+valior etc. Galdalf was around a lot as I drew all 3 and sneaked him twice too.

Smashed the 21 progress target with really high questing.

Ive never been sure if this applies as the card number is 20 so not quite sure if you have to cap at 20 and then get at least 1 damage on Smaug, so I played another turn to try that. Quested low to save people for combat. Smaugs burgle-surge meant he ended up doing 6 consecutive attacks kiling each time, including Eowyn (undefended) and Gandalf. I only had enough people left to get 1 damage on him but it was enough. Phew.

 

Will replay a few times with this winning deck now, without the pressure lol.

I wonder if the 21 quest points is clarified in the faq??

You can exceed the total progress on a quest card, so you could have twenty-one or more progress on stage three and win with no damage on Smaug.

Played again with this deck, smashed it with questing.

High questing and lots of allies seems to do very well on this quest if you ignore hitting the dragon :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I did have 1 or 2 of that card in my winning deck yes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I think my key cards were Valinor for Glorfindel,  unexpected courage, celebrians stone, steward of gondor, sneak attack, gandalf, burglar bagins,  elronds council (I think that's its name, reduces threat), plenty of willpower chump blockers (with Faramir supercharging them in one of the victories).

There's a female ally neutral card whose name I forget but great card. Costs 2 but gives 1 back to a noble hero so really only costs 1. So perfectly cheap chump blocker but also has 1 wp so nice to add questing until chump needed, good card.

 

As a leadership/spirit deck, getting steward of gondor on Aragorn giving lots of resource to him plus a spirit icon, then 2 spirit heroes, meant resources were never a problem for either sphere. Obviously dependant on getting steward out of the deck but both games that happened. I think I put a full 3 copies in.

So today I started playing again.

 

Played Battle of Five Armies for the first time and used the previous deck to get a feel for it. Got hammered! That deck is no way suitable.

 

I see the key in prioritising the quest stages for their negative effects, but couldnt get progress to stay on before it got knocked off..

Need a deck with good defense, attack and questing, which the current one isnt really, too many attachments that didnt help me, not enough allies.

 

Need to go away and think about a deck design then give it another go!!

## 416 [alexbobspoons on May 18, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=3941099)

Designed a new deck. Bit like an army.

Glorfindel (spirit) Aragorn (Leadership) and Gimli. Lots of allies, combat effects and mitigation cards.

Played a game and lost.

Was a struggle, didnt manage to get anywhere near as many allies out as I expected, this hurt me and I lost aragorn early which meant I kept drawing leadership cards without a use. Had plenty of resources but couldnt play much. Managed to get 1 progress on each of the three stages but by that time I was starting to become overwhelmed by Bolg Bodyguards with 3 engaged, so I couldnt hold out long enough. Technically I burst threat but only because of a few rounds of Bilbo defending with the ring.

 

Cant think of anything YET I would change with this deck, think it was a bad draw/play. Need a game or few more before I can feel if the deck needs changing.

## 417 [alexbobspoons on May 26, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=3944554)

So I beat the quest.

Mixed feelings on it.

I really enjoy how it does feel like a battle, so much going on, such a panic to get things set up so quickly, very thematic.

But..

I also feel as a game it has too much emphasis on getting things set up too fast. At the start there is a scrabble to get questing progress on all three stages to avoid the bad effects, while also encounter cards are removing the progress AND also have additional bad effects if any stage has zero progress on it. So this starting point is MANIC. But, once you have yourself set up with a couple of progress on each stage then the negative effects fall from loads to pretty much zero and you can just bash away at the remaining part of the quest steadily.

 

The goblin surge remains a hard thing to beat. The big bad guy went down in one hit from a powered up gimli with glorfindel.

 

Think I will move on from this, the quest is fun but the starting panic is too stressful to make the whole quest completely enjoyable.

## 418 [alexbobspoons on June 2, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/139109-the-newbies-first-experience/?do=findComment&comment=3947871)

Thread seeming quite these days :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Anyways..

Had another go, horrible starting hand after mulligan but I pulled it back some. Had the three intermediate stages with 9-7-1 progress upon the end, so not quite managed the last stage. I bust threat at 50 bt Aragorn and Glorfindel had died that turn anyway as I knew I couldnt win so did a blaze of glory finish. Bilbo and Gimil had one health remaining each.

 

I still dislike the pressure on starting with this quest. If you dont get a good enough start (starting hand) then the game punishes you so hard that it seems too hard to pull back from. True that deck design could try to get cards out fast, but I am not too good at that part of a deck design.
