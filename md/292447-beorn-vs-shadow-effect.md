Hi guys,

I have the following scenario:

I just have one hero (Beorn) in play, I declared him as a defender but King Spider comes up as a shadow card.

In this case Beorn must be exhausted, Is he still considered as a defender until the end of the phase?

Regards,

The declaration of the defender was already done, so even if a shadow effect exhausted the defending character that was still ready (or even blanked out the sentinel keyword if it was defending another player's enemy) the defense would still resolve normally. The only consequence would be that Beorn would not be able to act anymore for the round.
