I know he doesn't get much love, but I just played Nightmare Dol Guldur with my gaming group the other day and he became a beast with the following attachments--Spear of the Mark, Unexpected Courage, and 2 Dunedain marks (+1 attack each).  With this combo he attacked twice per turn, smashing stuff in the staging area most efficiently at an attack of 7!  My deck consisted of Éowyn, Théodred, and Dúnhere for some Rohirrim synergy--my friend was playing Théoden, Éomer, and Hama, for the thicket-of-spears recycle win.  

 

Only problem was I had hardly any cards because of that darn treachery card that drains them, and I was sitting on zillions of resources I couldn't use.  Should've included campfire tales.  But we still won, so we were happy.

oh yes- Dunhere is still a great hero. cheap, access to treachery cancellation, and of course as you say -the spears hitting in the staging area. pair him with legolas and hands upon the bow, you may never need to engage! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Yea, I love to get 2 Spears of the Mark on him. I created some secrecy decks, one of which uses traps, so he's pretty much guaranteed to have something to destroy.

Wow that's just dirty--lol.  I love it.  Get Anborn in there to recycle traps and it gets messy I bet.

Sounds like you guys had a great game mate!

Dunhere can indeed become a real powerhouse when you get the spears out early.

And you played multi player leadershit with out campfire tales? Shame on you! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

It's a auto include at our table; it only gets better with more players.

Yeah, I'll be fixing that asap!

What? He is commonly recognized as one of the best heroes in the game ever printed. Now with 7 attack into staging area... he is just godlike.
