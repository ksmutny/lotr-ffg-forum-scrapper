With the release of the last box for the saga, we are probably facing the last year of the game in terms of new material. We will still probably see a new deluxe expansion based in Dale/Erebor/Iron hills and its cicle, but beyond.

Personally, before the line ends, I would love to see some old cards re-printed with a "lift up" errata which would make them worth being included in a deck. I know there are plenty of such cards (see this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/] for some examples), but it pains me to see some very iconic Middle-Earth stuff that is not worth putting (nearly) in any deck. For example, Radagast or the Horn of Gondor.

I specially like the idea for Radagast [https://www.flickr.com/photos/146910575@N03/31409463396/in/album-72157673544027673/] from John Constantine [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/250511-john-constantine/] or the much more thematically correct Horn of Gondor [https://theshadowarchive.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Horn-of-Gondor.png] from Dav Flamerock [https://theshadowarchive.net/lord-of-the-rings/]. Another nice card that could use a lift is the White Council, which could nicely be errated to include the sentence "Players may spend resources as a group to pay for the White Council" in line with some of the new cards we are seeing these days. https://www.flickr.com/photos/146910575@N03/31409463396/in/album-72157673544027673/

I would like to have all of the cards that have seen errata.  I would like a core completion set.  I would like some of the cards you are talking about.

I don't believe it will happen.

May be not but I have some hope it may happen :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
