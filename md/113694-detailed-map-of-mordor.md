Anyone seen this before? Some pretty **** interesting stuff, especially Carn Telloth where Sauron apparently intended to house Smaug!

Only issue is some stuff isn't canon (names for all the nazgul) but it appears as though that is only the Nazgul as everything else on the map seems to be legitimate and can be found elsewhere on canon works.

A lot of the place names are non-canon also - from MERP not Tolkien himself - eg Carn Telloth that you mention.

does the map say it's sources? because many Tolkien sites source each other, as jjeagle says - Carn Telloth isnt canon

 

i think the most detailed map of mordor, is the one just printed in the back of the book? i mean, there are atlases and other things, but i think Mordor wasnt filled in with detail (probably on purpose) ... the only named places i can think of off the top of my head are

-Barad Dur

-Mt Doom

-Sea of Nurnen

-Nurn

-Black Gates

-Cirith Ungol

-Durthang

-Minas Morgul (if you want to count it as Mordor)

-Valley of Udun

-The Surroundinf mountain ranges
