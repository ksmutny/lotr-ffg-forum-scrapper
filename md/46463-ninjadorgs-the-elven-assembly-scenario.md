Okay, so here’s the last official scenario in my ‘trilogy’ (since The Lost Road is for one hero only), which will allow you to play The Old Forest, The Forgotten Ruins and this “The Elven Assembly” in Nightmare mode. Enjoy!

Another fine piece of work! The local players seem to be picking this up. Keep 'em coming!

 Thanks mate, I think that'll probably be the last one for now, at least until the expansions come out!
