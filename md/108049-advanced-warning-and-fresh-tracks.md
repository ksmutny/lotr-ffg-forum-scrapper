I have a few questions on some card usage:

1. Advanced Warning: in what way is the card useful? It only prevents engagement checks into the end of phase, so they still will engage just but just at end. Am I interpretng this correctly ?

2. Fresh Tracks: it says enemies added to the staging area, but does that include enemies revealed during staging? I have played it as such but would like confirmation.

Thanks

1. ? Until the end of the phase is until the END of entire phase. No window, neither little window to forced engagements.

2. Yes, all enemy added to the staging area, coming from whatever it is.... encounter deck by revealing, etc.

 

Both cards are good cards.

So if I play advanced warning they can't engage me at all?

If you play advanced warning, not only do they not engage you, they don't engage any player - the skipping of engagement checks is not limited to just the player who played the card.

 

If I'm running an all lore deck and am facing a quest that likes to dump a lot of enemies at once, then I love this card. Unlike others, it doesn't prevent me from optionally engaging so I selectively pick one enemy (per player) to pick off and kill.

Combine an all lore deck with a all tactics rohan deck that play records to abuse advance warning and forth eorlingas, I'm curious how it will work out.

Thanks guys for helping me understand the value of advanced warning.

When you quest almost all characters and you pass to the next quest card and this one triggers 'reveal x cards' and you have a lot of enemies in staging, you can 'delay' the combat for the next round, when you will be ready.
