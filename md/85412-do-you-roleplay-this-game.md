after talking about the amount of fun one can get from theme playing on another thread, i thought i would ask this

…do you roleplay this game?

one of my favourite things to do is to not only build theme decks, but also come up with reasons why such characters would be together.

dunedain, noldor, dwarves and hobbits are particularly my favourites as they sit so well with the early chapters of the fellowship of the ring….my personal favourite part of JRR's works.

of course its a little harder to explain why dain, eowyn and beorn would be together, but its fun trying….

who else does this?

i wish i role played more in this game. a lot of the time i get caught up in the mechanics of the game and lose focus of the whole point which is having a good time.  role playing does lend itself towards creating more thematic decks which is always fun too

Same as above.  Thanks for mentioning it cuz I will do more of it now.  I think about allies and stuff maching my heroes traits most of the time but I never think about the heroes themselves.

thanks for replying. its good that others do. its especially great when the game ends up exactly as you have role played it….perhaps if strider and the twins were scouting out an orc encampment in the foots of misty mountains (road to rivendell) and end up stumbling on a secret doorway, which suddenly open and out pours an orc ambush…however the elven twins, spurred on by each other, valiantly fight off the attack…

…..the designers really have made this game a roleplayer's treat
