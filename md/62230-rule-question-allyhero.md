# [Rule Question: Ally/hero](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62230-rule-question-allyhero/)

At times, I see: Any Hero, also I See: Any Ally

Can I play Any Hero on any character?

Can I play Any Ally on any character?

And if both questions are no, how can I recognize then the cards that can be played on any of my characters (so Hero and Allies).

 

thanks,

 

Laiyna
