G'day!

I live in Australia (which now that Oprah Winfrey has visited, means that everybody else in the world knows where that is!) and I was wondering if anybody might know the best way to buy this game. Currently the Ozzie dollar is at near parity with the US dollar so, should I buy it from the US and ship it here or wait and buy it in Oz?

US price will probably be half of Ozzie price but I will need to add postage which will probably even things out!

I also have no idea of how far behind the US release date it will appear on Ozzie shores and then I need to consider the inevitable monthly expansions and how I also get them.

So does anybody know if you can sign up in advance for ongoing delivery of initial release and subsequent expansions like a subscription service that will offer discounts?

Many thanks,

Fatboy Chubby

I have all of my LCG's on constant order at my FLGS he brings in them all for me as his distributor has him on standing order as well. I am sure any store would be happy to set that up. Also having recently sold some stuff on ebay and shipped it to Australia(which I knew where it was long before Oprah I am sure) its very expensive to ship down there and very slow if you don't use air mail which is crazy expensive. Now keep in mind I am in Canada so it might be less to ship from US as its closer, not by much though. Really I would say support your local store and buy local. Less hassle involved and less waiting.

I personally like http://www.gamesparadise.com.au [http://www.gamesparadise.com.au]

Other than that, I agree, support your local gaming store!

Who's Oprah Winfrey?

 

Just kidding!

Even here in Europe (Germany), I've heard about her. But I don't think I've actually ever seen her on TV. Is she really that popular in the rest of the world?

 She's popular among superstitious single mothers.
