 Can Peace, and Thought only be played after your Heroes have refreshed and threat has been raised?  It seems this is the only window for a player action which leaves you with two exhausted heroes for the next round unless you have another way to ready them.

Refresh Actions can only be taken after the readying of cards in the refresh phase.  So any cards exhausted by the refresh action would remain exhausted until the refresh phase of next turn, unless you have other means to ready them.

yes i believe, looking at the timing chart at the back of the rule book, that the refresh green window is the last part of every turn
