Just to beef up the dull experience Hills of Emin Muil provides so far, I came up with two optional rules that should give this quest a bit more of a twist:

1) After both Amon Hen and Amon Lhaw have left the game draw one more encounter card during the quest phase


2) All enemies get:


Forced: If this enemy is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return this enemy to the staging area after it attacks, and


Forced: After this enemy is defeated, shuffle it at back into the encounter deck.

This will provide the quest with the hit and run dangers of the enemies that will pursue the heroes through Emin Muil. The danger will increase the more locations the players have removed from the game (less locations in the encounter deck but same amount of enemies), so its a build in "danger timer".

The rule about Amon Hen/Lhaw gives the players a tactical choice remove them fast from the game and suffer one more encounter card each quest phase or eat the threat and try to live with it.
