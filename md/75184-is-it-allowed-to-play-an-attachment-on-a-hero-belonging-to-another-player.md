I learned the game by playing with friends not by reading the rules.

When they play they play attachment on each others characters.

Is this really allowed?

The rules states that attachments shoold be played on a players play area.

If it is allowed is it also allowed to play a ally and place it in control of another player?

rulebook page 25:

 

When a player plays an ally card, it comes into play 
under his control and is placed in his play area.
 
&
 
When a player plays an attachment card, he has the 
option of giving control of that card to another player 
by attaching the card to one of that player’s characters

And to follow on from Rich, you can play attachments on other players characters providing the provisions of the card are met.

For example Burning Brand can only be played on a Lore character. etc.

Can I add to this question? What about when a card has an ability "give one resource to another hero". Does this mean another hero under the control of that specific player? Or is this player allowed to give a resource to any hero under any other player's control?
