I have to the chance to build an insert for the core box out of foam core.
Was hoping that somebody already have a design ready since my ability to design stuff, well lets just say they aren't that great.

Was planning to store all encounter cards in one box.
If no design is available, how much space would you do for each encounter, and also for each Deluxe/Core set encounter sets?
