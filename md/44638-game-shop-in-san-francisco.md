Hello

Anyone that can recommend a good store in San Francisco that might be selling Lotr: TCG ? Have a friend going to the US so planing on asking him to get me a copy.

BR Enies.

Gamescape (on Divisadero.) There is also one called Just Awesome on West Portal, but I've only been there once or twice...
