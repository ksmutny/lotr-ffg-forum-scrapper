Let me first start off by saying, yes, as a math teacher, I am aware that there is other significance to the date.

But my buddy and I were running through the saga and we have reached the Pelennor Fields scenario, which I hear is the best scenario in the game. We are attempting it tonight for the first time, so I was reading up on it last night and discovered: https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields [https://lotr.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields]

> On March 14, 3019, the Siege of Gondor began, and on the morning of March 15, the Army of Rohan arrived with 6000 riders. 

In other words, the Battle of Pelennor fields took place 3/14/19.

Providence that we should land on the scenario on this particular date!

Have a great day all!
