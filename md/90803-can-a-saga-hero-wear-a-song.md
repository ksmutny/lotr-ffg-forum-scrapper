# [Can a Saga Hero wear a Song?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90803-can-a-saga-hero-wear-a-song/)

And use the Song to spend their resources for that sphere?  By Saga hero I mean Bilbo or Frodo in a saga expansion.

 

Also, can I attach Steward of Gondor to Bilbo/Frodo to make sure he has a steady supply of resources?

 

I've looked around and I can't think of why not to either question.

Since FAQ 1.4 that Narvi's Belt was erratad to the following:

 

Narvi’s Belt KD 3
Should read: “Action: Exhaust Narvi’s Belt to give attached hero a [Leadership], [Lore], [Tactics], or [spirit] icon until the end of the phase.”
 
 
This was done to prevent using it with the Baggins sphere in the Hobbit Saga, as explained in some rulling  at the time.
 
 
So I'd say the Songs should follow the same principle.

There is nothing in the rules against attaching a Song to a saga hero (unless in specific scenario rules), so you can attach a Song card to a saga hero and spend his resource as the Song card allows (Spirit/Leadership/Lore/Tactic as specified on the Song card).

 

In the Over Hill and Under Hill version of Bilbo, it has the text: "cannot gain resources through player card effects.", so you cannot use Steward of Gondor to give him resources, though you can legally attaching it to him (without any effects).

I had forgotten that Bilbo has that line of text, but Frodo does not. Also, I think that the Narvi's belt errata is sort of the reverse case. (Obviously there could be an errata in the future.)

Narvi´s belt was errataed to prevent your regular heroes from spending their resources as [baggins] resources, which was meant to be a limited pool for the quests. Which is why saga Bilbo has the line: "cannot gain resources through player card effects."

 

Narvi´s Belt, I suppose, was a slip-up in that regard.

 

Otherwise Steward of Gondor + Narvi´s Belt on any other hero would have made the quests easier than was their intent.

You are completely right, Narvi's Belt was the reverse case.

 

 

Misread your question. That said, nothing stops you from using Songs on Hobbit Saga's Bilbo.

Both Hobbit Bilbo's have the "cannot gain resources through player card effects" but the Bilbo from On the Doorstep is only "from non-treasure cards".

Can you put dunadain warnings, burning brand and other attachments on Bilbo or Frodo? (Saga Version)

Can´t see why you wouldn´t be able to do that
