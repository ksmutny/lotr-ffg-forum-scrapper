# [The Erebor Hammer Deck, The Most Broken Deck Since Ziggy Miner?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76284-the-erebor-hammer-deck-the-most-broken-deck-since-ziggy-miner/)

## 1 [Mattr0polis on December 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76284-the-erebor-hammer-deck-the-most-broken-deck-since-ziggy-miner/?do=findComment&comment=739554)


Hi all. Do you like broken decks, infinite loops and completely dominating games of Lord of the Rings LCG? Then you are in the right place! Because we're talking about the most busted combo since the Zigil Miner deck. In fact, in my opinion this is way worse than the Zigil Miner deck but I'll let you judge for yourself.


 


Now, to start off, I did not find this combo. That well-deserved credit, as far as I know, goes to alogos on the BGG forums (alogos3 here). Give him geekgold if you see him on BGG. He posted about an infinite loop and said: "If you want to access this dark and forbidden knowledge that ruins the game, PM me." Curious, I sent a PM and got a legit reply. After laughing a bit, sharing the combo with my friend (The Janitor on here) and us joking about hilarious ways to abuse it, and reading comments like this: "There is no five card combo that breaks a game. Sorry, building up a five card combo takes too much effort in and of itself, particularly in a game like this." we decided we wanted to try it out. This is then simply the deck I built around the combo.


 


Anyway, let's get to it:


 


The Deck


 


Beravor


Bilbo Baggins


Thalin


 


Erebor Hammersmith 3x


Master of Lore 3x


Master of the Forge 3x


Gleowine 3x


Miner of the Iron Hills 2x


Longbeard Map-Maker


Warden of Healing


Haldir of Lorien


Gildor Inglorion


Gandalf 3x


 


Legacy of Durin 3x


Horn of Gondor 3x


Born Aloft 3x


Steward of Gondor


Song of Kings


Song of Travel


 


Daeron's Runes 3x


Peace, and Thought 3x


Lorien's Wealth 3x


Will of the West 2x


Wealth of Gondor 2x


Parting Gifts


Out of the Wild


Blade Mastery 2x


 


~~~~~


 


The Breakdown of Parts


 


Heroes


 


Beravor-For drawing.


Bilbo Baggins-For drawing. Start yourself as player one.


Thalin-You need a dwarf hero, and Tactics color for the combo. Thalin is also less threat than Gimli, which is better to hopefully keep enemies off of you early.


 


To be clear, our games are almost exclusively two or three player games. That's where this deck and combo works the best. The other players' jobs are basically to stall until you lock into the combo. I was sending Bilbo and Thalin questing every turn (for a whopping help of two! Oh and Thalin's ability.) but that was basically it. It was up to my friends to quest, defend, attack, etc. although all they really have to do is make it a few turns, stopping things from getting so bad that you lose in those first few turns or that attacks or things get through to this deck. Any of these three heroes dying will severely damage the probability of getting the combo up, in play and done quickly. I'll let my friend post up his deck if he wants to, but his main parts to help do these companion deck tasks were: a Spirit/Tactics deck with Eowyn, Eleanor and Hama (hopefully with Feint early). Beregond was also involved in the three player games to sentinel block for me.


 


The Combo


 


Erebor Hammersmith 3x


Master of Lore 3x


Legacy of Durin 3x


Horn of Gondor 3x


Born Aloft 3x


 


So, if it's not obvious to you what you need to do: Get out Legacy of Durin on Thalin and Horn of Gondor on Beravor as quick as possible. My friends' decks also ran copies of these two attachments to help us get them up faster. Then play Master of Lore and name "Lore Allies" to cost one cheaper. Now you can play Erebor Hammersmith for one, draw a card from Durin's Legacy, play Born Aloft on Hammersmith, use Born Aloft to send Hammersmith back to hand, gain a resource from Horn of Gondor, and repeat. Hammersmith gets you the Born Aloft back from the top of your discard pile, so, you can do this infinitely to immediately draw your entire draw deck once you hit the combo in your planning phase.


 


Drawing Cards Stuff


 


Master of the Forge 3x-Really awesome since three of the cards in the combo are attachments.


Gleowine 3x


Gildor Inglorion


Gandalf 3x


Daeron's Runes 3x


Peace, and Thought 3x-Ridiculous card.


Lorien's Wealth 3x


 


Beravor is two more cards for you each turn. This may seem like a lot of cards dedicated to drawing but I wouldn't change that at all. It doesn't matter how many slots are for this, it is the single most important thing. All you have to do is find those five cards, so we need to draw away. Peace and Thought is insane. There's games where you'll draw your 6 card starting hand, mulligan if it's not good, draw 2 more cards from start of turn and Bilbo and 2 more from Beravor, and then if one of those 10 is a Peace and Thought, have drawn 15 cards on turn 1. So, to that guy who said "There is no five card combo that breaks a game." and "building up a five card combo takes too much effort in and of itself, particularly in a game like this." you would be wrong. VERY wrong. Not only is this VERY doable but on average we were hitting the combo on about turn three and have even pulled it off as early as turn two. About the only thing that might stop you from doing it that quick often is resources but even that there are ways to help. Hopefully you get Horn of Gondor up early. Or a friend finds one of his Steward of Gondors to play on you. My friend also ran Miruvors to give me an extra resource quickly some games, plus you might be able to use your two extra Born Alofts (after you draw your whole deck) on your friend's allies to trigger Horn of Gondor a couple extra times. Also if your friends find their copies of Legacy of Durin or Horn of Gondor to play on you that will save you some. Try to save as many resources as you can but obviously work to find the combo. Mulligan at the start if you don't have at least two of the combo pieces. 


 


Infinite Resources Tricks


 


Song of Kings


Steward of Gondor


Wealth of Gondor 2x


Parting Gifts




Song of Travel


Will of the West 2x



 


Now that you've drawn your whole deck, here's where things really go off the rails. Once you draw your whole deck, hopefully you have enough resources to play Song of Kings on Beravor, who then can pay for Steward of Gondor, to make her Gondor trait. Or maybe your friend found his Steward of Gondors to play on you. Now you can play Wealth of Gondor 2x on her to gain two resources, then pay one to play Song of Travel on her and one for Will of the West to shuffle the 2x Wealth of Gondors back into your deck. Pause to do your Hammersmith/Born Aloft bounce trick twice more to get the Wealths back, play them both again, repeat for a net gain of one resource each time. Repeat until you have infinite resources on Beravor. Now play Parting Gifts to move infinite resources to another hero on the table, Will of the West, Hammersmith/Born Aloft, repeat until every hero on the table has infinite resources. Now find your Lorien's Wealths again and loop those infinitely as well on the other players so that they can also all draw their whole decks. Depending on turn order the other players may or may not be able to play all of their characters and attachments like you but if not they'll be joining all of yours next turn.


 


Other Ridiculousness


 


Longbeard Map-Maker- Um, him plus infinite resources pretty much takes care of questing…


Haldir of Lorien-Ranged/sentinel plus Blade Mastery trick in Combat Phase covers an attack/defend for an emergency on your friends if the turn order on the combo turn made them not be able to get their allies out just yet.


Warden of Healing-Infinite heals to everyone.


Out of the Wild-This is just ridiculous. Infinite plays of this equals almost nothing left in the Encounter deck. Some quests it leaves nothing or like only a couple cards…


Blade Mastery 2x-you can play this infinitely on every character in play in the Combat Phase, soo attack and defense are covered. Also useful for the Siege/Battle Heirs of Numenor quests.


 


Now everyone has their whole deck in their hand and has infinite resources. You can now do basically anything you want. Aside from the last couple of tricks here, there's a BUNCH more stuff you can do and loop infinitely, I just let my friend include these other tricks to lighten the deck load. You'll have to loop Will of the Wests/Lorien's Wealths on the other deck so that they can keep doing their stuff infinitely as well. Some of the best: obviously The Galadhrim's Greeting to reduce everyone's threats to 0. The Riddermark's Finest to clear every location in play. Hail of Stones/Grim Resolve or similar damage tricks to clear every enemy in the staging area. Tactics Boromir/Fortune or Fate to kill every enemy NOT in the staging area. Fortune or Fate to get all heroes back that died in stalling for you. What's almost funny is you'll find a lot of stuff isn't even necessary. I mean, do you even need to kill every enemy in play with events when you have basically infinite attack/defense characters? Do you even need more than a few allies now that you have infinite events to do basically everything?  It's really your choice which tricks to include and which ones become simply arbitrary.


 


Miner of the Iron HIlls 2x- This guy just is for if some of those stupid attachment treacheries make it onto any characters. Also they are other cheap dwarves you can use with Durin's Legacy in an emergency for a couple extra card draws if you're having trouble finding the main combo cards.


 


~~~


 


So there it is. If everything went well, on about turn three you drew your whole deck, gave every player's heroes infinite resources, let all players draw their whole deck, dropped everyone's threats to 0, eliminated all locations and enemies in (at least) the staging area, eliminated almost the entire Encounter deck, played every one of your allies and attachments (and depending on turn order, your friend's allies/attachments), plus other tricks.


 


Obviously there might be some games where you don't hit the combo and then everything goes to hell. But it hasn't happened yet. And as long as you don't actually lose the game, you can always pull all the way back once you do hit the combo. Your scores will be ridiculous too, and are only limited by the +10 points per round rules. Our best scores right now are a 13 on Into the Pit and a -3 on BATTLE FOR LAKE-TOWN. With the new scoring system even. I didn't even know you could enter a negative score but the quest log lets you and even says "use negative numbers if needed". *Shrug*. There's a few quests that could still be problematic but almost all of them you will destroy. Ironically, the Battle for Lake-town, the hardest quest available, is probably the best one for scores with this because of all the victory points. You just have to hopefully not hit like the 'attack everyone' Smaug or other bad stuff early in that quest.


 


I'm not quite sure how this will do solo. It probably depends on the quest. Obviously it will be harder, especially for early resources and blocking, but maybe still doable on many quests as long as you can survive. I'm not sure what I would cut to fit some of the other infinite loop trick cards though. Hilariously you don't even have to quest very hard (or at all!) as long as you find the combo before you hit 50 threat.


 


My main motivation for posting this, honestly, is to just bring awareness to the combo and to FFG. I kind of hate errata but obviously something here needs fixed. I'd hate to start going to those new game store events in January when the game night kits come out only to see this combo everywhere. It would kind of put a damper on the premiere of game night events right off the bat, in my opinion.


 


What part should they even fix though? Legacy of Durin? Master of Lore since he seems like something that could be abused later on as well? Wealth of Gondor, though I think you could then still maybe do an infinite resource loop then with 3x errata'ed Zigil Miners, Lure of Moria and Will of the West once your deck is out. What also scares me is that certain other parts of this might end up being broken on their own without the combo. Mainly Wealth of Gondor. Like, you can easily draw through 15 cards on turn 1 with a Peace and Though and if you hit a second Peace and Thought in those 15, you could be through 23 cards by turn 2 without playing any other drawing cards or Daeron's Runes or other players playing drawing cards on you. 23 cards! That's almost half your deck. And this is post-Beravor errata. If we can get through our deck any faster with future cards, Wealth of Gondor 2x/Will of the West infinite resources trick will be ridiculous on it's own and you won't even need the Hammersmith parts.


 


Sorry if I over explained some stuff here. I really just wanted to make sure everyone, veteran or apprentice alike, was fully aware of what this deck is capable of. I'm honestly surprised more people aren't talking about this yet.


 


Anyway, I would love to hear your thoughts. I'm sure some of you might even see ways to improve the deck and make it even more stupid, hah. Maybe my friend will post his deck as well, so you can at least see our version of a companion stall deck.


 


Enjoy!

It's not really fun, no. Once you draw the combo it's almost anti-climactic really, and the game is basically destroyed. I guess the motivation for doing it though would be good scores in the quest log or the prize support in the game night kits, etc. That kind of stuff. That's what worries me more than anything. And to be fair, the Zigil Miner deck wasn't really "fun" to play either but people still did it a LOT for whatever reasons.

this is exactly my take on these things. part of me thinks the designers of these decks set out to make a dekc that will break the game. (thats not aimed at you mattropolis by the way…or anyone else for that matter….i know youre just putting this out there for interests sake)

i guess what i mean is that there are people out there good at making these decks..really good, and i guess they just need to accept that once in a while a card wil come along that will chain react with previous ones to create a break in the game. all we (or they) can do is wait for the next errata and in the mean time either enjoy the broke game (if thats what they like) or pretend the card doent exist as i did with zigil.

i feel lucky that im not good enough at this game to have this problem reir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/reir.gif]

iddqd … the konami code, game genie… there are plenty of people who enjoy unlimited power modes, whether intended by game developers or not.  I wonder, though, what do you think the fix for this will be?  Limit Master of Lore's effect to 1 card in a phase (or 2 or 3)?  Limit Erebor Hammersmith's ability to once per round?  I would really hate to have them come down on Legacy of Durin or the Horn of Gondor.

Honestly, we ended up running this combo just to see if we could pull it off.  And it WAS hilarious to see three decks empty on third turn. Especially because our third player had no idea what we were doing.  But it boils down to the same problem as Zigil Miner.  A great card (Master of Lore) that is actually quite easy to warp into a broken combo.  It was just nice this time to be an ally when Mattropolis decided to try out one of the horrible combos he discovered.

Master of lore seems like one of the issues, and we may run into more issues with this card later on, but for this specific case it may be easier to focus on the horn of gondor, and only allow the response to take place in all phases except the planing phase, I think this wold break the infinite cycle because resources would eventually run out, and would not be replenished each time hammersmith leaves play.  This would work right?

I don't think this change to the horn of gondor response would at all diminish the quality of the card, since, at least in my games, allies really leave play durrin the planing phase.  Although, I may be missing some strategy that is important to another player. I certainly missed the one in the topic of this post.

As with the old Ziggy, I don´t see a problem. I tried them like most of us did and after a few games didn´t bother with them anymore. 

And for everything that involves the importance of a good score ( game nights or tournaments ) just make a restricted or banned list.

Problem solved.

Would any legitimate strategies be nerfed unduly if Born Aloft was limited to once per phase?

Very cool. I1 more unbalanced things in the game. And again Beravur and again unlimitd draw and unlimited hand size. As i always say any game with unlimited draw and unlimited hand size is always will be unbalanced. And like always the broken cards is Beravur, Will of hte west.

The big problem of this game is UnLIMITED DRAW AND UNLIMITED HAND SIZE!!!!!

I read that post in BGG, and I was not the guy who said "There is no five card combo that breaks a game", but I agreed with him, because when he said those words I think he was referring to a solo play.

You play exclusively 2~3 player games, and 2~3 player games are very easy even without this combo.

Only quest that is actually difficult for 2~3 players are Massing at Osgiliath and if the other 2 players can hold off the enemies for first 2 turns (which is how long it takes to set up the combo according to your post), you can win that scenario without this combo as well.

I admit, whomever came up with this combo is very creative and insightful, but the combo itself doesn't really create a situation where it turns an unwinnable quest into winnable one…. it just makes a winnable quest to be winnable with unneccesarily amount of cards in hand/play.

I've toyed around with this combo in solo player using various combination of Dwarven heroes. I still consistantly won against scenarios that I have won without using this combo, and I have still lost against scenario that I have lost without using this combo (namely Dol Guldur)

But being able to draw your entire deck in single phase, however impractical it is, shouldn't exist and I think errata on Legacy of Durin (a limit three times per phase or something like that) can easily fix this.

We don't play exclusively 2-3 player but a large majority are. That said, the game is still enough of a challenge after multiple hundreds of games that it continues to be our most played game. I definitely would not call it "very easy".  And I wouldn't write off a combo just because it's harder in solo. EVERYTHING is harder in solo and a lot of things are clearly not even balanced for solo play. I've heard many times that the game is balanced mainly with 2 player in mind, which usually does feel the most balanced to me.

The problem with errata to Horn of Gondor, Legacy of Durin, Born Aloft, etc is that drawing tricks alone might eventually lead to the Wealth of Gondor thing (or worse) again down the road with future cards.

I think I partially agree with Glaurung. Things like this will keep cropping up unless they put a cap on card drawing.

Simple solution …

 

How about a rule that says:

"Each card may only enter play, or be put into play, once per phase."?

 

Thus, once a copy of Erebor Hammersmith has entered play and been returned to your hand, you can't play it again that phase.  The only way you could play another Erebor Hammersmith would be to have another one in your hand - which in turn could not be played a second time once having been played out and returned to hand.

 

This would prevent any future infinite loops and still leave card drawing available for those lucky enough to play be able to Sneak Attack two Gandalfs in one round, etc.

So if someone really thinks we need an errata the only thing that needs to be done: Make Will of the West a "once per game" card or a "remove from game after use" card. 

That solves all our "game breaking" combos because so far all of them rely on WotW to keep them going.

Agree with you. Will of the west is most broken card what i saw in any card game. Show this card to MTG player, he will be shock.

the game is not easy with number of players. Yes in SOM cycle it was like this but now with HON is going more difficutl with the number of players.

I've been thinking about this situation over night and, despite my two proposed solutions above (1. limit Born Aloft to once per phase or 2. institute a rule saying each card may only be played or enter play once per phase), I've reached the following conclusion …

What does it matter?

 

Computer games include cheat codes and nobody complains if you use those cheat codes in single player or even multiplayer co-op.  So given this is a co-operative game, what does it matter if this combo exists?  If people want to use it, let them.  You don't have to if you don't want to.  What's the problem?

 

The only problem I see is any potential competitive tournaments with players competing to get the best score against a given scenario.  And if/when that happens, just ban the combo.  Have a rule saying that in competitive play, you can't play Born Aloft on Erebor Hammersmith more than once per turn.

Simple.

 

"God mode" exists in single player computer games, but not in online play.  I don't see why we can't have the equivalent for this game, too.

Sorry but I really don't see that as a valid argument at all.  I've played twenty CCGs/LCGs in my time and I don't think you can compare the cards from any of them to those of another - different games require different cards and different standards.

Hell, one really obvious example - the Babylon 5 CCG allows players to choose their starting hand.  No, really, it does.  Too powerful for LotR, right?  But it's perfect for Babylon 5 and the game would be terrible without it.

Saying Will Of The West would shock an MTG player is completely irrelevant.  :-)

What matters is whether or not it works for this game.  And I think it does.  Other than the prospect of uber-card drawing, which I think it's fair to say was never FFG's intention with any combo, why exactly would Will Of The West be too powerful?  It wouldn't …

Yeah, kind of agree on Will of the West as well. It has been a lynchpin in both this and the Zigil deck. Making it go out of play after you use it would stop the infiniteness of these types of combos. Though, you could still draw your whole deck in like a turn, which probably still isn't great for the game.

I'm sorry, "very easy" was not the word I should've used.

What I was trying to say was that 2~3 player games allow players to 'specialize', which allows players to do reasonably well against most scenarios without the need for extreme specialization (such as spirit/lore draw + wotw deck given in this post, or infamous Hama pure tactics lock down deck); if you are able to with with these extreme measures, you are probably skilled enough to win without them too….. but I said them in very poor manner.

 

And like what others said above, every broken combo arises from Will of the West. Fix that card, and always set limit per phase or round to repeatable card draw and that should be good.

So if someone really thinks we need an errata the only thing that needs to be done: Make Will of the West a "once per game" card or a "remove from game after use" card. 

That solves all our "game breaking" combos because so far all of them rely on WotW to keep them going.

Yes you right on certain points but….. any card game is need draw. When draw is unlimited is always bring to unbalance. If in 1 action i can shuffle all my dsicard pile back is really powerful. When i saw this card first time i was shock. And all the time on this forum i say will of the west, Beravur and Protection lf Lorien should to be ban or get errata. Now Beravur and Protector get already waht they deserve now is time for Will of the west. And also i still beliive we need to limit draw per round and sure we need to limit hand size.

Rather than have a draw limit, which requires keeping track of the number of cards drawn, I think a "hand cap" is better.  A limit to the number of cards you can have in your hand keeps you from drawing too many cards all at once.  It won't fix everything, but it is a good start, since it makes these combos slower and less reliable.

In one game I play, a hard hand cap was recently set at 16.  The end-of-turn hand cap has always been 8 for that game.  But the end-of-turn hand cap was not effective on its own, as 17 years of draw abilities made it possible for players to draw obscene amounts of cards in one turn.  Once they instituted a 16-card hand cap, it GREATLY reduced the number of people attempting broken combos.

FFG could easily do something like this in LoTR LCG.  Have an end-of-turn hand cap of 6 cards, and a hard hand cap of 12 cards otherwise.  Or some other numbers that they thought was fair.

same story was with previous Lotr card game from Decipher. From the begin Decipher game also have unlimited draw but very quickly come crazy powerful combos and they issue the rule of 4 ( cannot draw more then 4 cards every turn in felowship phase). Felowship phase is the same like a planing phase for FFG game.

Yes, I remember when Decipher announced that rule.  It made sense.  So did giving eratta to Far-Seeing Eyes to make it unique, which I think was announced at about the same time.  The "Rule of 4" just felt a little clunky, since you had to keep track of how many cards you had drawn that phase.  Thankfully, 4 is a rather small number, so it wasn't that big of a deal.

I still prefer a hand cap, since you don't have to keep track of anything in the past.  You only have to count the cards in your hand at the exact moment you activate a draw ability and see if you are allowed to draw.

Yes the good old times of Decipher……….I remember first Lotr world cup in Essen 2002. I was there with my country team……Good time!

Anyway hand cap is the good decision i agree with you. Sometimes is also geting weird when i play with my friend who love to play lore and Beravur and in the middle of the game he had more cards in his hand then in his player deck. And then he say : i can cancel this treachery let me check i should to have a Test of will somewhere here and it take a 10 second to just look to his hand. And after he play dwarfen tomb to get Test if will back to his hand. And from this moment i start to feel crazy boring cose i understand game is won 100% and is only matter of time and from this moment a game is just burden. NON change it! Now is not same every thing much more hard and i love it! Really waiting and like the idea of the new nightmare sets for the old quests to make them replayable with strong current decks.

Will see what Caleb will do now with all this issues.

I have to say that this mechanic has a certain kind of elegance. The Beravor and Ziggy decks have been pretty straightforward, but this Hammy tactic is kind of cool, especially as it does not affect solo play as much as multiplayer.

 

What I would like to see are treacheries that will be shuffled into the player deck. And they should  include mean stuff like "discard all your cards" or "raise your threat / reveal one encounter card for each card that you have drawn this round" etc.

That's a pretty cool idea. The only problem is that you could still abuse stuff in every quest without those treacheries. But still, maybe like an errata to Will of the West or something and then the inclusion of treacheries like that in some quests could be a way to make drawing decks look less enticing.

Yeah, that's a concern of mine as well. Keeping track of how many card draws, or even watching to make sure you don't go over a hand cap size, is just kind of clunky and not very fun. It's another monotonous task to keep track of, just like when we had to start keeping track of game rounds. Too many things like this and the game upkeep becomes more of a chore than it's worth.

We might be okay for a while again if they just stop the Hammersmith trick, don't make many more drawing cards, and then start making some of leptokurt's treachery cards.

The power of some of the cards in this game has been a constant surprise to me, I think. Stuff like the Zigil Miner, Will of the West etc, they're cards I didn't expect to see so early in a game's development. I mean, Will of the West is a core set card! Good lord, it makes you wonder sometimes whether the designers know what they're doing. I do remember the discussions about the Zigil deck where people were including loads of high-cost cards in their decks to get the resources they wanted, then they brought out scenarios that discard allies from play (Long Dark) and that use your high-cost cards against you (Foundations of Stone), which I've always thought were elegant ways of countering these ludicrous decks. It makes me think the designers do know what they're doing, and were just waiting for people to get comfortable with these crazy decks when they then make scenarios you don't want to play with them. So now there's a stupid idea of drawing your deck into your hand during setup or whatever, so what's the betting we'll be getting scenarios that say "during the planning phase, reveal x cards from the encounter deck. x is the number of cards in your hand" or "each enemy (or location) in the staging area has threat equal to the cards in total in each player's hand" and the like? Having the encounter deck copy the players could be interesting, too, so every time you bring an ally back from your discard pile, you have to put an enemy into the staging area or whatever. Basically, what fresh hell have they got in store for us now?

This doesn't really have any effect on the already-released scenarios, of course, but then up until they announced these new nightmare cards, I was firmly of the opinion that the designers thought we all only played the current adventure pack, and the other quests would gather dust once they were "beaten" etc. I dislike errata, either to cards or the rules themselves, so I hope they find some other way. The idea of mixing treacheries into the player deck sounds absolutely inspired, I'd like to see something like that happen. I don't want to give the impression that I think the game was badly designed from the start, but the fact that there are no upper limits has always really bugged me. Even the fact the rulebook suggests using alternatives when you run out of tokens etc - to me, if I've pulled all of the resources that were in the pool when I started, that's it, I don't go digging around for change to use! So I suppose if it came down to a rulebook erratum to introduce a hand cap or draw cap, I'd be happy enough with it. I'd prefer, though, if they found a way to use hand size against us in-game.

Errata are not the way to go. I think FFG have been way too liberal in their errata already.

As I see it, an errata should be used only to correct a true mistake (think Impulse in MTG) or some typo; not to completely change the original intent of a card's designer or correct a badly designed card.

(For example, the way I see it, the current errata on Beravor and Zigil Miner are bad).

The solution here is to simply use the banned / restricted list.

Puttting Will of the West on a restricted list with a number of other combo-oriented cards would quickly limit the possibility of abuse while leaving room for "some" powerful 2-cards combo to still exist (such as Beravor with multiple Unexpected Courage to quickly go through your deck).

Adding a hand cap is also a possible solution, although it again raises the question of why did they decide to let player draw infinite in this game in the first place.

Card errata are bad in general but I think they are far worse in a competitive game . Here if you use or don't use the errata then who cares really? I see them more as guidelines on to how to keep using cards that are otherwise problematic.  A banned list or even a restricted list seems really odd for a solo/coop game though again you can ignore it at your option or institute your own banned list for things you find make the game too easy to be fun.

I have found playing bad decks against easy scenarios as much fun as trying to figure out how to beat all the scenarios with one deck/pair.

There is no competitive parity to enforce. If somebody organizes a competitive event, he/she can compile a banned/restricted list or otherwise structure the tournament to eliminate degenerate combos.

We played this again yesterday and found a thing that can make it even worse. We thought you were at least limited to the amount of turns it took to get through all of the quest cards. Usually you can get through one quest card a turn, so your score (while still being ridiculous with this deck) is still limited, barely, because of the +10pts per round.

But my friend took Legolas today. After we pulled off the combo, he dropped two Blade of Gondolins on Legolas. We purposely left enough enemies in the staging area or engaged with us or in the Encounter deck (after milling it down to like 3 cards because of Out of the Wild), that at four progress each kill, Legolas cleared all of the remaining Quest stages by himself with infinite Blade Mastery and Grim Resolve.

Our final score was a 14, on Seige of Cair Andros, on turn 3. Going through all five quest stages. And this was a pretty bad go at it because we lost two of the three battleground locations on turn one due to horrible flips.

My starting hand even kind of sucked and after taking a mulligan I only had one of the five combo pieces. But after I used all of the drawing cards that I had, I had all five pieces before the end of my first turn.

I don't see the need for errata on these cards either. If you enjoy these types of games, where winning can be 100% certain the second you have a special card combo in hand, then great, here you go. I prefer to duke it out. I prefer to lose in a tight struggle than win in a landslide. (Well, every once in a while a landslide can be nice.)

For game nights, they seem like a more organized casual event anyway. Each location will play it slightly differently and can ban or restrict combos as they see fit. 

I do have to say kudos to the ones who found this crazy combo. It is a pretty thoughtful and creative use of the cards!

None of the cards in this game should have received errata. That was a philosophical mistake by FFG. If you're worried about certain combos in your tournament, publish a banned/restricted list beforehand. That will give the players plenty of time to plan accordingly.

Yes they should. If you want to ignore the changes in your own home then fine. I however want to know that all organised play is the same. There is no reason for them not to release errata, so that this consistency can be achieved for those who want it.

I have to agree. Infinite draw and infinite hand size are really bad! This can/will brake allmost all possible games. Think about playing a poker in a tournament agains a player who draws hole deck in his hand and the select his 5 cards for the game… fun? Definitely not!

Most of my friends are allready in the way of making their deck to draw more and more cards. It is not fun anymore and it allso makes most scenarios ridigilous easy. It is not fun any more after you find the way how you can draw all your cards in you hand. It is fun to make that deck, the plaing with it is really boring.

Summasummarum: we need errata or banned list or rule changes to help this situation! There can not be tournaments if and when there are so broken combos like there are today.

What about going back to the original post ?


Blade Mastery and Longbeard Map-Maker can be replace by a single song of durin with grim resolve/miruvor, you'll have unlimitted stat for the turn. (you lose the ranged/sentinel of Haldir though) (there is miruvor alone for infinite will, and also Grave Cairn for attack, Blood of Numenor for defence)

Out of the Wild is good, but you can't ban the discard pile. If you had just one The End Comes, you'll be able to empty a lot of different scenario. You just need a dwarf that leave play, but it's not impossible to find one (the irony :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

Gandalf can be played indefinitly when you play a born aloft on him, allowing you to have 0 threat, and clearing all the enemies. Problem with the locations ? add a snowbornscout.

I never though to play with this cheat code on multiplayer, I would like to see the face on the one who wasn't informed about it :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].

For your friend, you can add Wandering took with Elfhleim to reduce their threat for the score, and a Fortune or Fate.

In solo, this combo is prety easy to set up if you only got treachery or location. Ignore the quest, just defend enough to not lose hero and combo cards. Ending with 49 threat and a lot of damage to make the combo is worth it.

I think a dual deck building can be made to speed up the setting of the combo for some cards don't need to be owned by yourself (Legacy, Born aloft and the Horn).

Keep in mind that this combo only works during the planning phase. FFG has yet to make more broken cards !

This is what I figured at first too, but then the first game we played these decks, there's chances during the quest phase to play actions and once you've did the combo and have infinite resources you can loop events whenever you want: Out of the Wild/Will of the West/Lorien's Wealth on yourself/Out of the Wild/Will of the West # 2/Lorien's Wealth # 2/repeat. So even that's not a problem. As soon as the encounter deck reshuffles you can do infinite Out of the Wild again unless it's in the middle of staging but you can control when it empties by leaving just the right amount of cards in the Encounter deck. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

Got that one wrong, too hasty, it's Song of Earendil that work with wandering took.

 

For The end comes, it's to finish it all before hand, you cannot do the infinite draw loop out of the preparation phase, and you could only play 3 out of the wild at the start of the questing phase… not like you would draw anything that would make you lose, but… you know… conscientiousness.

No, you don't need the infinite Hammersmith anymore after that first planning phase. You can play WAY more than 3 Out of the Wilds. You only need the Hammersmith trick to draw your whole deck in that one planning phase. Then you can play any events at any time and an infinite amount of times because of the things you have.

For example, QUEST phase:

1. play Out of the Wild

2. play Will of the West to reshuffle the 1 Out of the Wild back in

3. play Lorien's Wealth to redraw that same Out of the Wild

4. play Out of the Wild again

5. play Will of the West #2 to reshuffle the 3 cards in discard pile (Out of the Wild, Lorien's Wealth, Will of the West #1)

6. play Lorien's Wealth #2 to draw those three cards again

7. play Out of the Wild again

8. play Will of the West #1 again to reshuffle those same 3 cards

9. play Lorien's Wealth to draw those three cards

10. play Out of the Wild

11. repeat infinite

You can do the same with pretty much ANY event card you want to loop at any point in the game where you have an action step, alls you need is to have the infinite resources you got during the planning phase from looping Wealth of Gondors on that turn you hit the Hammersmith combo.

It's really dumb, lol.

Yes, I remember when Decipher announced that rule.  It made sense.  So did giving eratta to Far-Seeing Eyes to make it unique, which I think was announced at about the same time.  The "Rule of 4" just felt a little clunky, since you had to keep track of how many cards you had drawn that phase.  Thankfully, 4 is a rather small number, so it wasn't that big of a deal.

I still prefer a hand cap, since you don't have to keep track of anything in the past.  You only have to count the cards in your hand at the exact moment you activate a draw ability and see if you are allowed to draw.



well there are times you will have a lot of cards in hand (e.g. Escape from Dol Guldur, one ally per turn) and it is perfectly normal to draw and keep over the initial hand size of 7

I'd love to have the rule of 4, at least it was not a problem to me when I was playing the decipher Lotr TCG

Drawing caps would kind of suck since it's another thing to remember. Not hard to do, just annoying.

I think in a perfect world I'd just like a hand limit you must discard down to at the end of a round. However that doesn't stop this deck at all so it would have to be in addition to some errata.

Where does "Master of Lore" come? I can't find it on lotrlcg.com [http://www.lotrlcg.com]

On the other hand I get the point that it's "not fun" that many are making, but keep in mind that FFG is trying to get this game into competitive and these combos aren't good for that…

Y'know, this will be laughed off, but it occurs to me that something does stand in the way of this combo… it is the real, physical world!

To make this combo work, you have to discard Born Aloft -- actually, physically put it in the discard pile -- pick up Hammersmith, grab a resource token, play the Hammersmith, pay that resource token, draw a card, take Born Aloft out of the discard pile, play it on the Hammersmith…. I mean, actually physically do those actions.  

I am guessing that this is not happening.  More like, once one has the combo on the table, he says "ok, let's say I cycled through that 40 times, and now I'll just draw my whole deck."  

If you consider the physical act of manipulating cards a compulsory part of the ruleset, this is a highly unappealing combo, even as powerful as it is.  Imagine a competitive environment though -- people would train to cycle this combo quickly!  And how awesome would it be to see some guy do this and draw his whole deck in under a minute?!

Lol yeah, I do go through the motions a few times so everyone can understand what it is exactly that I'm doing, but then I just skip to the part where I have my whole deck. Repeat for the part where I get infinite resources, let everyone else draw their whole deck, loop other events, etc.

Though I'd think at a game night or something more formal, you'd be glad for me to skip over the "physical" act of doing it if you are at my table so that you aren't sitting there for 30 minutes waiting while I go through every motion. Lol, that would suck, but would be a funny rule to enforce. I'm confident I could do everything & have enough resources in maybe under 20 minutes if I tried, but that'd still suck horribly for everyone.

Just wanted to point out that, although we're saying this combo is an example of a broken ruleset, you actually have to "cheat" … in a soft sense of the word… to make it bearable :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

since there is no loop rules or infinite rules like MtG, I'll anyone playing this deck to do every step of their infinite combo, including each deck shuffling, as a punishment apesta [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/apesta.gif]
