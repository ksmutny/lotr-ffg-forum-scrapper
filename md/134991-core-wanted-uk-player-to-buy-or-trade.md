Hi all, I am looking to buy or preferably trade for a core box. I am in the UK and would prefer UK sellers due to cost and if you happen to be around London then i would happily collect.

 

I have a number of items i could trade for this so please PM if you have anything

 

Many thanks

Daenarys,

Have you tried Orc's Nest (near Forbidden Planet, Shaftsbury Avenue)

http://www.orcsnest.com/ [http://www.orcsnest.com/]

or

Leisure Games (near Finchley Station)

I don't live in London (I'm up North!) but both are great shops!
