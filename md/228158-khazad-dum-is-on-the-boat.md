For anyone who's been waiting on the Khazad Dim reprint, it's status has recently been changed from "at the printer" to "on the boat".

This is the last item I've needed for my collection, and seeing the ridiculous prices on ebay has gotten so frustrating...

Yay, now we will have a 3-day break from all the "where do I get Khazad-Dûm?" posts until it runs out again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

3 full days to sell out? Pffft, the game is dying.

Seriously, though, I'm looking forward to posts about players' first time through KD and DD. It's my favorite cycle, I love how they absolutely nailed the theme and story.

I've just finished the entire Mirkwood cycle, myself. I have The Massing at Osgiliath on the way to tide me over for a little bit until KD arrives back in stores. I can't wait!

Three days to notice ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

It's definitely a fun cycle. If nothing else, it at least has the highest balrog per quest ratio.

My partner and I have run out of quests to play, without purchasing Khazad dum, so really looking forward to it being available again. We at least have Massing at Osgiliath, which was super challenging and fun, to replay, as well as the later Mirkwood quests, but most seem too easy at this point. I think our decks have pretty much made it possible to overcome the Mirkwood quests without too much trouble.

Ever thought of trying the Nightmare version of the older quest?

Since we're so far behind on the original products, not really lol but that is a good idea for later.

 

I counted up and we'd have to spend $535 (before tax) to catch up to the current cycle! haha

I'm around the same amount myself (counting all sagas, but not Nightmare - which I may just skip). Won't catch up this year :/

oh don't do that kind of calculus. Not good for morale... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]. More seriously, I bought the core set 2 almost 2 years ago (I think it was in September or October 2014), I've bought The Dead Marshes AP, then everything in order, and I just purchased Blood of Gondor / Morgul Vale last week.  So I go through 3 cycles in 2 years... so... yeah... don't think I will ever catch up!
