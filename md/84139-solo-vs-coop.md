I play mostly 2-player coop, and have been doing so since the beginning. I do play solo occasionaly though, usually when trying out a new deck. I have just made an Outlands deck (using proxy, since my pack hasn't arrived yet), and took it Into Ithilien. I have realised not only how good the Outlands are (I have known that for days now) but also how much easier Ithilien is solo. In the past the trend used to be opposite, and I think only Osgiliath was reversed but now HoN are all in favour (in difficulty) of solo play. And it is not just marginal, it seems totally scaled towards that. The encounter decks just combo so well with more players, if no more than 2. I wonder whether it is intentional or accidental, if solo players have been heard, and if the trend is going to be continuous. How is Steward's Fear in this regard?

Granted, I've not played Steward's Fear with two players, but it's rather brutal solo. This is mainly because there are so many enemies that come out of locations, and even then, there are so many locations, it's very hard to progress. I have heard it's not as bad as all that, but I've only beat it once… on easy mode. Still, if you have a good outlands deck, I'm sure you'll be able to score a win on it.

 

Good luck when you get the chance to challenge it!

Oh thanks, interesting. I do have a good Outlands deck but I am sure it is not an answer to everything. FFG seem to be doing a good job at making very different quests, especially lately, and what works in one of them usually doesn't in another.

Some quests a  more difficult with a number of players and some are not.

Lost in the dard very wasy solo and 2 players game but try it in 3 or 4 players is going really hard. Cose only when toy revealed at least 3 encounter card per phase  you start to see combo of encounter deck. Same for the Flight from Moria and Massing at Osgliliath.

Same for all HON quests.

But Dol-Guldur is diffferent. More players more easy. So is really depend on the quest. But sure solo game and coop game expierince is different. And deck bulidng also.

Yes, true, I forgot Flight from Moria, I have hardly played that one, never liked it (Hunt for Gollum was also a bit easier solo, perhaps the only Mirkwood quest)… I just felt if they would push toward making solo easier with the newer quest but Steward's Fear may already prove different. I was just surprised how much easier Into Ithilien (especially) felt compared to coop. Scaling is certainly not easy. Thanks for the input.
