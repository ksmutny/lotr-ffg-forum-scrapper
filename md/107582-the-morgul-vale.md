This is the hardest quest I have played solo. Any tips?

Win? Use a better deck? Sorry. I'd give better advice if I had ever played it.

I haven't beat it yet!

I agree it's hard. I think there's a topic in strategy about this, I may have started it myself. I've heard Caldara decks can beat it and Hobbits do pretty well. I want to beat it with a Gondor deck but never can.

Have you watched Glaurung's MV Video?  If not, do so.  The deck he used beat it pretty good.

My elves deck laughs at it, but my super hero attachment deck gets whipped.  It's about keeping your threat down until you are ready and then trying to finish the quest in two turns.

I Don't recall the exact decklist, but I remember defeating it with ease with mono tactics, and being confused by everyone saying it was hard, then trying a different sphere and losing horribly. So my advice is try tactics. I think it was a hama-recycling deck.

Just played it and beat it first go getting my second victory against it =)

Lost many times trying to get my first victory however.

You have to kill Murzug and Alcarnon quickly and face the nazgul early on keeping your threat low.

Won with 7 tokens on To The Tower.

I second the suggestion to use a Hama-Feint-Recycling deck.

Thank you for the tips, all! Yeah, I played with my elf deck: Elrond, Glorifindel, and Legolas. However, I just couldn't set up enough allies to deal with even Murzug. I haven't watched Glaurung's video yet. I am going to tonight!

I finished watching Glaurung's video on the Morgul Vale. That was an interesting way to defeat the scenario. I really enjoyed the video Glaurung! I would of never of thought to keep the main enemies in the staging area the whole time in order to defeat them. Anyway, a very good strategy. I suppose there are many ways to beat the quest, but my elf deck is not one that fares so well against it.

Really?  My Elrond, Mirlonde, Glory (Sp) deck just laughs at Morgul Vale.  Board in all of the Elrond's Councils and Galadhrim's Greetings.  Keep your head down until you are totally loaded on the ally front and then blast though the quest in three successive turns.

I won it with two different mono sphaire decks. A tictis with Hama, Legolas and Beregond , and a Spirit with Frodo, Glorfindel and Pippin.

In tactics i was recycling the feint or thicket of spears, in spirit i was keeping threat low choosing enemies
