 And have some fun.  There is a groundswell that believes that Glorifindel will be the new hero in one of the next two expansions, and there is reasonable evidence to support the belief.  Going by the Aragorn template he will have the same stats as the old Glorifindel, but a new sphere and ability.

So…  What sphere do you think he will be and what will his ability be?

Spirit.

 

Hope he has some ability related to Silvan / Noldor.
It would be awesome.

 Spirit.

Glorifindel does not exhaust to in order to commit to the quest. 

Quest Response: If no progress tokens are placed on the quest card during this phase, exhaust Glorifindel.

This sounds like pretty bad design.
Also, it should be a "Forced:" effect, otherwise, there is no reason for a player to trigger it's Response.

Yeah I guess it would be a forced affect. After giving it some thought, I can't see Glorfindel as a Spirit hero. He would be better off in Tactics or Leadership. Giving bonuses to Noldor characters or have an ability related to Slaying a Balrog.

Keeping him ready somehow would be very poweful but given he's Spirit, it does not seem very likely. Although, there may be a trend of a diversion between "ready" effects and "not exhaust" effects. We Do Not Sleep is a Spirit card which allows not to exhaust. There  has been a case with Wrapped! where "not exhaust" would come off more useful; but it has been the only one.

Having 3 attack hero within the Spirit sphere would be a big boost no matter what. And it is hard to come up with a proper ability. Scaring off enemies might be both thematic and with the spirit of Spirit though.

I hope ffg will let us know today who's coming. I have never considered myself an addict but this game has got me but good. I usually check the site many times on Monday to see the new preview. **** it if I have to wait till Tuesday or even Wednesday for Tolkien's sake.

 What about..

 

Glorfindel does not exhaust to commit to the quest. 

Quest Response: After an enemy is revealed during the staging step, discard X cards from the top of your deck to put that enemy on the bottom of the encounter deck. (X equals the enemy's threat value).

Interesting ideas. But the first is too powerful I feel. The second one is good but it would have to be played around a bit probably because some of the baddies have lower threat etc. It could still work that way though. So I would quite like the response ability, something along those lines.

 This is a variation on an idea the Cardboard of the Rings guys had, but it would work thematically.

Glorfindel

Threat cost 15

Willpower 0
Attack 0
Defence 0

Hit Points 2.

Action: If the Balrog is in the Staging area, Discard Glorfindel from play to Add the Balrog to your Victory display.

 

Obviously, this would be useless outside of a Balrog quest. Think it would be tricky though to give him 'Normal' stats and not make him overpowered.

Either way if there's Balrog death happening, I'll be extremely disappointed if it comes at the hands of anyone except Glorfindel or Gandalf.

I do hope there's no battle with the Balrog in Shadow and Flame. It may be hard to avoid but it goes totally in contrary to the following story. It is almost like defeating Sauron in one of these pre-LotR times. None of the Fellowship (safe Gandalf) had any idea of the Balrog in Moria when they entered the Mines, did they? Now when I am thinking about it I wonder why from all the places the designers took us to Moria which should have remained un-scouted prior to LotR (except by Balin's expedition which a long time had sent no news).

i wonder why moria at all? it certainly seems more challenging from a design perspective ie how do you keep it fresh when your always underground

not that im dissapointed in this cycle- completely the opposite- it just feels like moria could have been a later cycle

Same here. I do like the cycle mechanic (and player cards even more so perhaps), quite a few new ideas here and there but I think it was not the best choice to visit Moria after Mirkwood.
