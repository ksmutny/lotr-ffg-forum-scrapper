I know I probably post these silly threads more than all other visiters combined. Still, I cannot help the curiosity, so be with me whoever enjoys the guessing game.

Now, we've got a Boromir as a allround attack boost. The original Faramir ally was an allround willpower boost. And of course, one can combine them together in a Leadership oriented deck. But do you think the designers will go with it for the hero version as well, or will they provide a more solitary version of the brother, similar to the original Boromir? I would think so and I feel it shall be a Lore Ranger.

Any other ideas?

i also think lore, he was wiser than his brother. i think he will be able to give some sort of aid to defense and protection

The history rights by  people like Boromir. He is most interesting character in the book cose he is a man. Just a man like you and me.Same like Isildur. just a man.

When i was 7 years old and read the book first time i was really inspire by his story. He was strong and straight. I dont think Faramir was more wise. But he was more weak for sure.

 Boromir tried to take the ring

Faramir didn't (and don't let Peter Jackson convince you he even thought about it much)

 

therefore, Faramir was clearly both wiser and much less "weak"

Oleg, this is my favourite post of yours, ever.

I do feel Faramir was wiser in a way but there are different ways of being smart or intelligent. I would not outright say Boromir is the most interesting character in the story, but for me he is surely among them, one of the first that come to mind. I have a strong feeling for the whole tragedy of the family though.

As for the game, I hope Faramir comes with higher willpower stat than his ally version since he will not likely be able to boost others anymore. If any Gondor character should have willpower of 3, it may well be Faramir.

But do think of the situations they were in. I myself still consider the whole plan as foolish, as Gandalf rightly puts it. That it was the right thing to do in the end is another matter. That I am myself rather foolish is very probable but that is the fate of man.

I'd favour a spirit Faramir with a high WP and/or defense and a low starting threat, as he was an inspiration for the men who were with him and he knew how to set ambushes. His special ability could be something about trapping enemies (like Forest Trap) or cancelling the threat of one enemy in the staging area (like Radagast's cunning) or reducing the attack strength of an enemy.

Yeah, sounds good; just the abilities you mention feel as prototypes for Lore (as are the cards you mention).

 How about something to do with the siege or battleground keywords? Perhaps something which makes him the partner to Boromir?

 

Gondor allies gain +1 Willpower, maybe also:

'If the active location is a seige, Gondor allies gain +1Defence."

that would be nice and thematic, but a little restrictive in other quests…such as bombur

Gonna make up a new Faramir hero because i'm bored

Hero: Faramir

Sphere: Lore

Starting Threat: 6

Gondor. Noble. Ranger.

WP: 2   ATK: 1   DEF: 2   HP: 3

Action: Exhaust Faramir to choose an enemy engaged with a player, take the top player card from your deck and attach it, face down, to the chosen enemy.  While that player card is attached, the enemy cannot attack.  When the enemy is discarded, so is the attached player card.

Flavor text: "So this is the answer to all the riddles: here in the wild I have you, two halflings and a host of men at my call, and the Ring of Power within my grasp"

 

Not sure why I picked Lore,  although thats where it seems a lot of the "ranger" cards are headed.  His ability is basically a re-usable forest snare which kind of stays in-tune with his ranger and trap background.  I tried to balance this great ability by keeping his lackluster ally stats.  I picked a low starting threat mostly so that his bad stats wouldnt be so much of a turn-off as though he wouldnt be used (as if this card would see the light of day anyway) plus he seemed very skilled at keeping away from the enemies of Sauron which is the thematic purpose of threat to begin with.

I do hope Faramir does combo with Boromir. Not as strictly as do Elrond's twins, but that there is a clear combo without printing Boromir's name on the card. As much as I like the current Boromir version, the ability is a little bleak and Faramir could spice things up. I just cannot myself see how; and even if I did, it would mean little.

Boromir is my second favorite character in Middle-Earth, he is strong, he is bold and he is honorable - in the eyes of every Gondorian, at least.
Faramir has a lot of Willpower, I remember somewhere in the book where he has the chance to get the ring and he refuses it, so, in a game sense, I would put him with 3-4 willpower, high defense and low attack even though he was a nice ranger.
