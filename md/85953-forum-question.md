How do you search topics/threads?

I mean to search LOTR LCG topics and stuff.  Remember like before the update there was the grey thing you could click that said "Search Topic" And you would pick Lord of the Rings Card Game and then type in something like "Redhorn Gate Spoilers" and then it would give you all the topics that were related to Redhorn Gate and Spoilers.  Do you know what I mean?
