I made a custom map- board for this game, as I was feeling it needed a map to give you a sense of the locations. After all what is Middle-Earth without a map? I posted it here: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1461169/custom-board-lotr-lcg [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1461169/custom-board-lotr-lcg]

Check it out, and feel free to make your own! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Awesome!

It looks a bit like that online interactive version of spots/locations from the game (dunno its link, sorry). Is there a source for those maps?

Thanks! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I have the description for everything I used in the link. Check it out for details. But to answer quickly to your question, the maps are from Karen Wynn Fonstad's The Atlas of Middle Earth and I also used Master of Lore's excellent maps for some of the quests: https://sites.google.com/site/thelotrlcgatlas/home [https://sites.google.com/site/thelotrlcgatlas/home]

Yep. That site was in my mind.
