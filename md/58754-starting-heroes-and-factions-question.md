# [Starting Heroes and Factions Question...](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58754-starting-heroes-and-factions-question/)

## 1 [PKDuke on January 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58754-starting-heroes-and-factions-question/?do=findComment&comment=577435)

So I've read the rules, I've watched some tutorials, but before I start my first game there is something I still need clarification on.

It looks from me from setup descriptions that the three heroes I choose are supposed to be from the same Sphere of Influence(i.e. Denothir, Glorfindel, Beravor(Lore)).  Then I shuffle all(or one of each?) of the related Lore-icon Player cards(+Gandalf) into my Player Deck.    However, I see several examples in the rules of a single player having heroes from different Spheres.  If this is the case, is my Player Deck now a mixture of all of the (let's say 2 different) Spheres for the characters I choose? 

So in case I am too confusing above, let me break down my question(s)...

1. Can I field heroes from different Spheres as a single player?

-and, if "Yes" to above....

2. Does my Player Deck include all cards in the base set with the matching Sphere symbols or one copy of each particular, different card(+Gandalf)?

Thanks in advance to all helping me with my noob question....I am anxious to play happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif].

Yes, definitely. The Core Set comes with four pre-constructed decks, one for each sphere. If you don't want to build your own deck, you can simply use one of these. For instance, the Core Leadership deck would consist of Theodred, Aragorn, Gloin, and all the associated Leadership cards (+Gandalf). But, if you want to build your own deck, you can (and probably should) mix two or more spheres together. So, you could make a Lore/Spirit deck with, say, Eowyn, Beravor, and Dunhere.

For simplicity's sake, if you are using one of the pre-constructed single sphere decks, you will include all cards with the matching sphere symbols (+Gandalf). If you want to combine two spheres, I'd suggest just adding all the cards associated with those spheres. Then, as you play, you will find certain cards more useful than others, and you can start removing a few things to thin out your deck. The "official" deck size is a minimum of 50 cards, but there's nothing preventing you from playing with a bigger or smaller deck if you so choose.

Hope that helps, and welcome to the game happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Thanks for your reply.

So am I understanding correctly that I build my 50-card minimum Player Deck with any combination of the Player Cards from the Spheres related to the heroes that I choose?  Also, in building my deck I may include multiple copies of the same card(for example, 1 or 2 of "Self Preservation"(Lore- Card 72)).

hi

 

in 50 card decks you have

-3 heros of any sphere

-at least 50 cards out of the related spheres (you could have cards not related to the heros spheres but thats when you have song cards- im just complicating things here though)

-UP TO 3 copies of each card

 

so say you had a tactics,lore, and spirit heros

you could have say 1 thirds of each sphere in player cards, or you could go mostly tactics and the rest the other two, and so on....

Thanks to all, I am somewhat of a veteran with card-drafting games(Thunderstone, Rune Age, etc.) but I never played CCG's or LCG's and thus the deck-building element of this game is new to me.  I appreciate the explanation for a noob like mehappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif].
