 I've got a question about Son of Arnor.

 

When I play him, say on turn 1 during the Passage Through Mirkwood quest, can I pull the Forest Spider right away from the staging area? Also, do I resolve the combat during the normal combat round or when Son of Arnor engages the Forest Spider?

 

Thanks!!
