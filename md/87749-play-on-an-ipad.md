Just wanted to inform about this neat little app. It's called CardWarden and it's a tabletop simulator. In other words, you can play just as in real life and you have to do everything yourself. But you can import the images/take your own pictures for whatever game and play it on the go :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] it just so happens to work really nice with this game even though you can play whatever board-/ccg-/lcg game you want. I use it for lotr lcg and death angle. Just make a google for CardWarden. And I'm not getting payed for saying this. I just thought it was awesome to be able to play it on the go :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

IS there any database with the cards for the game ?

Â 

It is something similar to octgn ?

Sounds kinda cool ill have to look into it. I thought it would be really cool if FFG/anyone made an app for the game that helped with miscellaneous things like keeping track of the turn, threat, progress, etc. not that I expect it to happen but it would be cool. I know there's something like that for magic

It's like octgn, but for the iPad. And you have to put the images in yourself. Either by capturing them with the camera or you can import them from you desktop and then import them into the CW. It's a bit of a work but afterwards it pretty cool :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I know another that only uses the CW to do the encounter deck. This way he gets to play with the cards AND get an easy solution to managing all the different encounter decks and use them.

Personally I didn't feel for taking a picture for every single card I own so I went for a better and quicker result. I took the images from the lackeyccg LOTR LCG plugin. You can do it from the octgn files too but the quality of the pictures aren't as good as the lackey ones. Can hardly read the text on the quest cards.

But bear in mind, only use the images of the cards you own! Else it's piracy.

How long did it take you to create a single deck and a single quest?

## 6 [mr.thomasschmidt on August 3, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87749-play-on-an-ipad/?do=findComment&comment=830472)

The timecomsuming job is to get the cards into the CW. You will use an hour or so just for that. And that is if you find a good way to organize it first. I had a lot of thinking back and forth and used a lot of time here until I found a way that worked for me (you are welcome to pm me and I'll happily share the knowledge :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

When all the import job is done, you can make the decks as quickly as in real life. Same when setting up for a quest. One of the advantages here is that when you have set up a quest you would like to play, you can save the game. So if you loose you can just load the game and start over. No need to start setting it up again. Of cause you should save before you do the final quest setup as read on the cards ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Oh, thx. I will give it a try.

I tested CardWarden and played a little lotr with it. Yes, it works. It's some work at the beginning, but afterwards its ok. It definetely has to be improved. Here is a review:

CardWarden is a little program for card freaks, who want to have their own cards on their ipad to play on the go. It's kind of octgn on a tablet but still very limited. There are no games preinstalled, you have to import and built your own games. It is just a sandbox, but it still has to improve to be really satisfying. Once you understood how to get your cards into the database and how to play with them the fun starts. There is no alternative out there i know of, so i hope CardWarden will be upated.

Card Warden has all the basic functions that a card board game simulater needs to have. You can import your own cards by importing image files, or you can just photograph them with your ipad camera to get them into the system. Cards are stored into virtual boxes, where they can be arranged in different card decks.

Then you can load these decks and play with your cards the same way you would do on your kitchen table. The program allows you to tap cards move them around on the board, add tokens, etc. Even a dice roll can be simulated if you need one.

The "playing with your cards" part is nicely done, i managed to fulfill a quick round with my living card game.

I think the basics are there, but CardWarden has to improve the import and card management system a lot. I had problems to understand how to get the images right, photographing the card backs and fronts. I wish you could do this more flexible. Changing the image of a card is almost impossible and very frustrating. You can not delete a single card, but only all of them. The card management is way too limited and needs to be improved a lot!

Sth important: it is single player only. There is no network play with your friend.

lackeyCCG for iPad is done... an is just waiting for the apple gods to approve it (yet another reason why andoird owns) and this it will go live. It has all the same fetures as regular lackey, including being able to connect and play to others using mac windows and linux as well as all the other 100s of games it supports.

Good news, cause it would be difficult for me to photo all the cards to import them . With two kids less than 2 years of age time is not friendly on me :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

IF I ever comes. Over a year ago I asked eagerly when it would be done and the message I got then is the same as I got about two month ago. "It's done. I only wait for getting it approved by Apple. Shouldn't take more than 3 weeks" So I will get excited WHEN it comes. Until then I'm not taking Travors word for when it MIGHT come. And I'm not yelling at you booored :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'm just very disappointed in the way Trvor has handled this. He's a great guy but it doesn't take over a year to get something approved by Apple(slow as they might be). So either it wasn't done when he said so or he just hasn't really been paying any time to fix what wasn't approved. And that's called giving your fans false hope.

Also OCTGN has announced an update, again almost a year ago, that a near future version will be cross platform. As in being able to be played on iPad.

But where CardWarden is the strong one is in the card importer. I'm totally dependent on either Tragic to update the lackey plugin frequently. Or some other guy to update the octgn plugin. With CW I can do it all my self.

@nyck And just write your suggestions on the comment line. The developer reads it frequently and listens very close to his buyers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

@thomas I already did :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I think CardWarden has great possibilities to be a neat little app. I will have to import my cards again. because i messed it up totally. i am interested in how you organized your boxes. But since i am too stupid to send pms i did not ask you yet ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Â 

Yeah it is true that my updates are not as fast or as often as some people would like. The thing is though any personal user can update the application pretty easy.

Â 

All you need to do is go into the SETS folder of the plugin and load the carddata.txt file. in a excel editor, like Xls or Clac or something. It should import with all the data in different columns. All you need to then do is save the images form somewhere and write the name of the image in the 3rd column. If it is a encounter card, put ",encounter" after the image name.

Â 

Clipboard_1.jpg [http://s16.postimg.org/6jm0vbbhx/Clipboard_1.jpg]

Â 

Then type in the names. the third column is the sub dir in sets where the image is taken. I have been using the initials for the APs. There is a lot of other data but most people just use the images so you do not even need to fill it in if you do not want to. but if you do just follow the examples of the other entries.

Â 

When you save it make sure you save as a TAB DELIMITED text file and your done!

Â 

So yeah.. not to hard to update the files for yourself.. in fact most LackeyCCG users do it this way. My updates are in fact usually taken fomr other users that I collected after the end of each cycle.

Â 

Hope that helps!

First of all, I didn't mean any disrespect or complaint. If it was how it was seen I apologise.

I'm a big fan of your work with the plugins and have enjoyed many hours of play I might not have been able to play without them. Now that you break it down in this way it does seen very easy to update. Which is a good thing. Cause what I meant by being dependent on you to update wasn't about the time it coul/would take before you updated it. Simply meaning that if you for instance quit the game for good some day, then we are dependent ion someone else to take it up which might never happen. But you effectively turned that fear away with you explanation on how to do it yourself :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So if ever lackey comes to iPad I believe this WILL be the best way to play this game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I've been on another Hearthstone kick lately, and it's really because it's on the iPad. It's a fine game but the convenience factor is the only reason I've been playing it more than proper card games. As one can imagine, it's easier to chill on the couch with the wife playing on the iPad than with physical cards. So for that reason I am determined to get CardWarden up and running so that I can play my favorite with a proximal level of convenience.

Â 

I'd done it once before but partly gave up after a while. I'll follow Ian's guide [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2014/05/22/exploring-cardwarden/]again but I'm going to try and find a shortcut of some kind, maybe by importing the images from my desktop (not sure if that will save any time). Will report back here when the time comes!
