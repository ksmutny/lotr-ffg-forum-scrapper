when you are discarding cards without being told specifically what order to do it in (for instance shadow cards at end of combat)…what order do you do it in?

i seem to remember someone saying you can choose….this was about the returning of snow cards in redhorn pass

i only ask because it sometimes makes a difference when told to return certain cards

Yes, I've asked this question before and got the reply from Caleb that the player can choose the order if the effect does not specify otherwise.

Especially handy if an objective card passes as a shadow effect, and you've got Shadow of the Past in your hand!

and be sure that when an enemy leaves play, its shadow card goes with it.
