Hi guys,

just a short question: When Thaurdir in the Battle of Carn Dum attacks and a shadow card is revealed, do I mind itÂ´s sorcery keyword? Or does the sorcery keyword only affect him when revealed during questing?

When you reveal a shadow card, you ignore all of it apart from the shadow effect.

Unless there is an effect in play which explicitly contradicts this - for example the Witch of Angmar in The Dread Realm has an effect which triggers if her shadow card(s) have the Sorcery trait. However no such exception is present in Battle of Carn Dum, so you follow the general principle - only the shadow effect matters, so Thaurdir doesn't trigger.
