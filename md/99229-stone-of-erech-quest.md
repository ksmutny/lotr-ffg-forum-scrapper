What do you guys think about The Stone of Erech?  Nobody talks about it.  

How often do you guys play it?

I haven't had a chance to give it a go.. yet. I have it on order when it comes in I'll try it out. I really like the ideas in that quest and have immensely enjoyed all the PoDs so far so I am pretty keen.

It's an extremely enjoyable quest and not nearly as brutal and unmerciful as Massing at Osgiliath and the Battle of Lake-town. I definitely recommend picking my up; it's not like any of the other quests in the game and you'll find yourself approaching it in different ways than most other quests too.

The thing I liked about this scenario having just finished with the Heirs of Numenor quests was that this one didn't feel nearly as random. If you make up your decks right, it's still a challenge, but you feel like you can handle whatever comes at you. Compare that to say Into Ithilien or Siege of Cair Andros and it was a huge relief. A lot of fun!

Nailed it.

Each and every card in a PoD quest is designed exclusively for it, so the randomness and the luck factor is very small, in contrast with (mostly) the HoN and AtS quests where the luck of the draw separates victory from defeat (more than deckbuilding and strategy).

I dont know where uw challenge there?..... is really boring and easy quest..... there us nothing just long annoying desert........ really big dissapoint. Nothing at all. That why there is no talking about this quest. Big flaw......

Quest is cool and fun, CAN be very difficult, but most Dwarf decks can handle it.  Boss blanks everyones text, so Outlands become very weak, no Dain bonus, etc.  First introduction to a Timing mechanic, where the longer the game goes the harder the cards become
