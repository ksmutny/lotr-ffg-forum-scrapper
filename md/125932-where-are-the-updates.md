Supposedly, Nin-in-Eilph has been released for 5 days. By now, OCTGN has an update with the text and Hall of Beorn has some type of update, but I haven't seen anything. Have the moderators for these not been able to get their hands on the packs yet?

Dunno. Celebrimbor's Secret is on the boat, though. Warms me in the cold evenings.

Maybe just give it some time. I think that when the moderators find the time, they will start the work. As in LoTR, time is always short and a precious thing.

As much as I wish that the blog, podcast and search engine were my primary focus, I have to spend all day killing trolls in order to pay for the Hall. It just so happens that I have a huge deadline looming at the end of the week, and I'm trying desperately to fight off whatever Orc-fever everyone around me seems to have caught. Suffice it to say, I will be adding Nin-in-Eilph spoilers soon, but it probably won't be until Sunday or early next week. If some generous soul wants to pay for me to do game support full-time, I'm all for it. Otherwise, I humbly ask for everyone's patience as life can sometimes necessitate other priorities. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Hey Dan. Thanks for the update. OCTGN just got its update today too. Sorry for my impatience.

If you ever want some help on the Hall of Beorn maintenance, let me know and I could probably fill in some gaps. I know it isn't easy to trust your code to a stranger, but there are ways around that.
