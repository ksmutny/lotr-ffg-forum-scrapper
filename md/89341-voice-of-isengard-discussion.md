## 1 [Karlson on August 27, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=851557)

Fantasy Flight just released some really nice preview articles as well as the new homepage for the next LotR Deluxe Expansion, the Voice of Isengard!

 

I really think the new Time component will be a blast to play with, but the Doomed player cards are going to be a knife in the ribs for me because I typically start with beefier heroes and a higher threat.  

 

And it looks like Saruman will be an ally after all.  I predict he slowly turns evil over the course of the Ring-maker cycle.  I'm particularly excited about 9 different encounter sets in this expansion, as well.  That's going to offer a lot of variety, so I'm assuming each quest is totally different.

I'm really excited! I love how the player cards are really powerful, but they come at a great cost in threat gain. Lore Aragorn is going to be really good, I'm thinking, with those new player cards! 

 

I wonder if there's going to be any more Rohan stuff in it besides the spoiled Tactics Hero? However, the art in the set is really cool! Love shadowy figures in armor!

check out the description page- there is another rohan ally spoiled.....in general this looks to be the best pack yet- amazing design ffg

 

so many great cards spoiled so far....

I've said it before, but I'm really excited for this box, like it's the one I've been waiting for the entire game! Very excited at getting to see Rohan and Orthanc, and of course, my favourite character from the saga, Saruman! Quite pleased with what they've done with him anyway, and all these Doomed cards are pretty thematic for doing a deal with the devil.

Yeah over at the About/Description page for the game there are Two Allies or Heroes (presumably) in the background, the one mentioned by rich (which I don't think is Eowyn; check the ears they look like elf-ears), and a male elf (maybe a new Haldir?). Looks like a great expansion.

I think we're going to see more elf heroes by the looks of the pictures. Those Orthanc Keys combined with Legacy of Numenor is going to be crazy. I wonder what the tactics and spirit doomed event is going to be.

 

Lore Aragorn just got even better than he already was.

## 11 [richsabre on August 27, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=851612)

well it seems pretty standard so far- leadership = resources, lore = cards....so tactics=  damage to enemy and spirit = willpower boost

 

as for the female elf....well, its not galadriel, i doubt its arwen, there isnt really many more...so im guessing its a made up hero (unless im having a major brainfart and forgetting somone)....and with art like that, who can complain?

I think it should be fairly easy. You'll need the Core, but that will be the only thing needed for the quests. I don't think the player cards from AtS are game changing enough to make it too difficult in the future cycle.

i am hoping that this deluxe pack and cycle will be the polar opposite of AgS and HoN. not difficult in hoardes of enemies charging towards you, with battle and siege, but clever difficult...so you really get the feel of an intriguing and deep quest, one with plenty of options that are all worth exploring (whereas many 'option' quests really only have 1 or 2 choices that would ever make sense)

The quest setup card in the article has the player set aside 20 cards as an "out-of-play deck" and it appears you mix in some encounter cards with it. This is an interesting, new game mechanic. I'm curious what it is for...

Second Hero speculation

Who do you guys think (or hope)? Another Rohan. character? Someone from a neighboring region (perhaps an elf or hobbit)? ANOTHER dwarf? A new Theodred that fits into the new Tactics/Spirit Rohan alignment? Personally I want to see the Marshal of the West-Mark, Erkenbrand, which would mirror the combo in HoN (both heroes from same area, one a big name, the other, less widely known but still crucial to the plot of LotR).

i think the 2nd hero is the woman on the images. must be an elf as you pointed out....im guessing ffg-created

 

arwen would be random to say the least.....certianly isnt galadriel, and as i said, not many left from that

I second Rich's guess. It could be FFG-created, but I think it could be Arwen. It looks like Magali's work and looks like a hero, battle-ready version over her damsel in distress objective version.

The article also says two "notable" heroes. I might be reading too much into the use of the word, notable, but I don't think the hero will be ffg-created.

true....but what would be the connection? if we are going in order, the arwen should still be in rivendell...unless she travels back to lorien. perhaps this is the cycle for silvan? silvan/rohan....i like it

## 36 [kyrie on August 27, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=851700)

My hunch is that it is a hero version Arwen. It is definitely Magaili's art, and it looks strikingly similar to the Arwen art she has done already. It could be that she is visiting from Rivendell to join our heroes in the quest, just like the elves did in the Dwarrowdelf cycle. It's not too much further away from Rivendell so I don't think it's too much of a stretch.

 

As for the male elf on the left, it could be hero version of Haldir. At least, that's what I am hoping for. More silvan synergy would be welcomed.

## 37 [Pharmboys2013 on August 27, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=851702)

So much cool info with this.  First of all i'm really glad to see that Eomer's ability gives him a plus 2 attack and not a plus 1 (especially with the now confirmed limited once per round...i prefer this over plus 1 limit 3 per round).  It wont be hard at all ensure he's striking with 5 each turn...I'm liking him a lot.  Also, i cant even explain how excited I'm going to be to create a "Captains of the West" deck using core Aragorn, Prince Imrahil, and Eomer...especially given that the latter two seem perfect for each other.

 

Putting the doomed keyword on cards is a really great idea to encourage more strategic deckbuilding and influence greater decisions in game rather than just picking which characters quest, attack, and defend as can often become commonplace.  The fact that they have cards that indirectly work with these voluntary threat increases like the orthanic guards and orthanic keys are also quite cool as it suddenly becomes its own archetype (one not limited to a "trait" either...although it seems the "isengard" trait will be surprisingly plentiful)

 

Call me crazy but my first reaction to Saruman is not a great one.  Cost is reasonable and stats are great obviously but the threat gain is a bummer and i dont really think the ability is that great.  Firstly because it can only be something in the staging area and secondly, because it just removes it from play for a single turn...so its still going to be there.  Its not even like if you picked an enemy you could attack and kill it off without worrying about it attacking you and you wont be able to travel to the location that you select and clear it from the board in its weakened state.  Maybe it'll be better in practice but I think i'll be trying some of the other cool cards before i will Saruman

 

Finally my favorite topic...hero speculation!  The female elf on the banner is a bit interesting.  The looks work just fine but it seems somewhat out of place for her to have a sword drawn and bruised from battle.  I also dont think its a created character because as previously mentioned I'm sure the term "notable" for the hero selection was done very purposefully.  Its going to be someone we know.  I remember when Heirs of Numenor was announced there was the banner picture of the then unkown Celador who many people thought might have been the artwork for Faramir but that obviously ended up not being the case.  The elven female may just be an ally...or if it is Arwen, good for FFG for portaying her differently enough to make us debate about it haha.

 

Also...on page 1 a few of you said you saw an elf that looked it could possibly be Haldir?? where is that? the only banner characters i see are Eomer, that smug orc, and the elven female

Westfold Outrider (The Rohan Ally sort of spoiled) seems to have an exhaust to choose and enemy (or location) in the staging area. Will it be an attack? Will we have a tactics ally that can do locations? That seems rather cool.

After searching my cache (which was intact) I found an image that kept popping up as a black square (and therefore I presume was the image that got deleted). It was "MEC25_bg_mini.jpg". They may have, alternatively just written over the old file with a new one and kept the same name (MEC25_bg-b.jpg).

Good luck finding it.

Hmmm very interesting and suspicious. I think my vote is going to that character (presumably Haldir) as the second hero. It's a significant individual and the removal of the image is just too much of a coincidence. I can see the conversation at FFG now: "put up a picture of the new hero as part of the banner" "ok done! What do u think?" "No! Not that hero! The one that's already revealed! Hurry and change it." "Ok sorry... There....I bet no one even notices"

> Also...on page 1 a few of you said you saw an elf that looked it could possibly be Haldir?? where is that? the only banner characters i see are Eomer, that smug orc, and the elven female

The elf that might be Haldir is here (on the top left): http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=210&esem=1&epmi=s [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=210&esem=1&epmi=s]

 

 

Woah! I just went to my own link in a new window and the picture banner totally changed to Eomer!!

 

Did FFG take down the man-elf and put this up instead all of a sudden??

 

I just saw the above posts. I guess I'm not the only crazy one...

 

I have a screen shot of the original shot because I left the page up from earlier...but don't know how to upload it to here.

Although, the art on that female elf looks too good for an ally. The only other allies that I can think of off the top of my head that might even come close to that good are Haldir and Gildor... Hmm. And she looks like a spirit character for some reason, whether she's the hero or an ally.

I think you might be onto something Pharmboys...miscommunication and FFG not wanting to spill all the beans up front. I think Haldir is going to be amazing if it's him.

I'm too lazy to read the whole thread, but this just looks like it's going to be the best expansion to date (for me at least). Everything seems to be getting better; art, theme, mechanics, etc.

to summarize so far for those just joining we are debating who the art spoilers are on the about page. one appears to be an elf woman, and the other, which was taken down and is now eomer, was an elf man, possibly haldir.

Haldir would be a good guess, and as for the elf woman I think it's either a made up hero (unlikely) or just an ally (I think this is more likely).

the more i think about it the more i am interesting to see what is going on in the storyline. we are obviously going near lothlorien, though i think that it will not be a big part of it until it gets its own cycle.

My guess is that the female elf is definitely a new (warrior) version of Arwen. The resemblance to previous depictions is definitely there, and she could conceivably make a trip to grandma's house and participate in some adventures on the side!

I would think Legolas as well, only Magali has depicted him having black hair, not blonde like in the movies. There are other elves it could be, but if you look at the art on her Haldir ally card, the resemblance is striking.

 

Any case, we could speculate on this for days. I'm really looking forward to this new expansion, especially playing around with the doomed keyword on player cards. I have lost count how many games I've lost due to threating out. And now players can optionally raise their threat for power cards...seems like a Palantir temptation thematically. I like it!

Wow. These new deluxe expansion and ring-maker cycle looks promising. Rohan decks will be interesting to build. I lile how Saruman was designed, it couldn´t be more thematic. I also wonder if Isengard will be a playable trait. Also is it me or is the box of a different color from the previously spoiled one at GenCon. Art of both elves is fantastic (it has to be Magalli´s) if those two were the only cards on the box i would still buy it.

By the way Guard's response effect is worded it seems like you would be able to trigger it from the doomed effect of an encounter card as well. Does this seem plausible?

 

I know it is less likely to happen, but hey, that would be a nice benefit to be surprised by. And the Keys of Orthanc is even better because you get a resource.

I'm thinking it's almost definitely the hero version of Haldir.  As for sphere, that could go to really any of them except for Tactics (since Eomer will be the Tactics hero of this expansion.)

 

I am most curious to see what all "Isengard" traited cards come out with this expansion and cycle.  To be honest, I never really thought of Isengard as a faction in its own right before (when compared to Rohan or Gondor.)  But it looks like it's about to be, and I'm excited to see what it is represented as -- so far, a lot of doom goes with it!

yes, i like the idea of isengard as a faction. in the film it was portrayed as a nice peaceful retreat (until the obvious) where saruman pretty much lived alone, but this certainly was not the case. there were guards, and housing for the guards....it was afterall a numenorian tower, so i think the guard is well chosen

Not sure if any Gondorians were still left living in Orthanc per se, but it's certainly not a stretch to depict the guard as one of them.

As far as sphere placement, I would think Lore makes the most sense although it would be cool if he had decent combat stats and was spirit.  As noted tactics isnt happening and i'd be surprised if he was leadership since those are the two spheres we got in HoN.

 

Also as neat as it is to get isengard cards i hope this expansion/cycle doesnt turn into a outlands/gondor scenario where the seemingly weaker or less popular faction (isengard) becomes radically more playable than the mainstream or popular faction (Rohan)

I doubt Isengard will be even remotely as powerful as Outlands has fleshed out to be (I don't see how they could fit in that many different allies!).  But then again, I'm really not on the same page as many players --- I play this game first and foremost because I really like the Lord of the Rings.  Additionally, I have a lot fun while playing it with thematic decks rather than the most powerful one.  

 

With that said, I never keep score or have the urge to "beat" my previous best wins or anything like that.  So as far as Outlands being way overpowered, I'm not really opposed to it because to me, it's just another theme deck to use. 

 

Overall, however, I do have to find a balance between playability and theme for most quests in order to stand a chance at beating them!  I guess what I'm trying to say with all this banter is that I'm not against higher power decks because I'm not playing this competitively; I'm playing it for fun.

The problem with the changed banner is much simpler: they used the banner from the next deluxe box.

I like Saruman, good defensive card. Specially for Tactics.

I actually would prefer if Isengard get developed like Outlands.

Outlands are provinces of Gondor and has no intention of seperating from the kingdom.

Isengqrd has been fortified by Saruman as ally of Gondor (therefor ally of Rohan), but Saruman is not serving Gondor and Isengard is certainly not part of Rohan.

So having Isengard as small powerful keyword makes more so than it did for Outlands.

Regarding guards of Orthanc, I think I read it somewhere that thet are mixed breed between gondorian guards that were posted there long ago and local Dunlanders, but can't be certain.

For solo game deck building in the current game system very limited.

In coop game you have a very big choice of deck building.

This is a bit sad since in solo game there is only 4-5 decks which is playable. Other deck you can play but there is mostly lose then win.

so really big and cool mode for the game is coop.

About new box. I love it! Should be cool! Idea of doom and time is very good effect solo and coop games. Since i play mostly solo i like it.

> Westfold Outrider (The Rohan Ally sort of spoiled) seems to have an exhaust to choose and enemy (or location) in the staging area. Will it be an attack? Will we have a tactics ally that can do locations? That seems rather cool. 

Its " Discard Westfold Outrider to choose...."

 

I guess it will deal damage to an enemy or even discard a non unique enemy with no defense or something similar.

Haha... I wouldn't be surprised. Those characters would make much more sense with the next saga box.

 

I also think Saruman isn't bad. His ability is basically: Add one to seven willpower to the quest (unless there's nothing in the staging area). It also gives you time to deal with enemies which is nice.

Oh, I love the art again. Especially the now hidden Elf. But also the two event cards, and especially the Legacy, beautiful.

Saruman is tricky, great design. Word of Command does seem to combo very well with him - though it must be kept reserved for Gandalf, haha.

Just so much to talk about, very intriguing mechanics. Threat reduction has just been given new dimension. Elrond's Counsel works wonders in solo with the new Doomed cards. The Galadhrim's, on the other hand, in 3 or 4 players.

And yeah, I believe we must be getting more Elves in this cycle. It is just about time. Lothlórien is close, and so is Eregion.

You keep Sneak attack and W of command for both now. Cool! Now you can have 6 wizards in your deck which is very powerful.

Hey Guys Just saw the anouncement and read throught the topic :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Nice!

 

I really liked what I saw so far, but for me the most intriguing part is the replacement of the banner! Why would ffg want us not to see this elven male but don't care about the female elf?

 

To me - although I was quite convinced that we will be getting a new Arwen hero - this might indicate that the male elf will be the second hero. However, wether Haldir or Legolas I cannot say, though the hair colour seems to be a valid argument.

 

I am still convinced that the female is Arwen, though! I was actually hoping when we get to see more elves and hope (until the official anouncement) that the next deluxe expansion / AP cycle would focus on the evles of Lorien.. :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

 

Anyway, already very very excited about this new expansion :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I suppose it could be something as banal as this is a Rohan/Isengard box, but the banner doesn't show any Rohan stuff? That for Heirs of Numenor [http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=157&esem=1&epmi=s] was very Gondor-y, after all! 

 

I'm going to second the vote for Erkenbrand in this box, then see what happens from there. It would be really awesome to see more Elves in this cycle - I was hoping for an Elven box to come next - though all those hopes are now swept away by this awesomeness!

This is also inaccurate. In the novels it is never specified which color was his hair. Some people speculate it could have been blacl or blonde, but either of them is possible. In both the Bakshi film and in MECCG he is depicted having blonde hair.

Personally I think it's just a design question, not any sort of stealth move to limit exposure to the upcoming card art. How do I know this? Because they replaced the unnamed elf with EOMER! I'm guessing it went something like this...

 

*FFG LOTR LCG team stands around the monitor looking over the updated website with pride*

 

Boss: Looks great! But, Hmmm something feels wrong.

 

Convenient child: Where's Eomer Daddy?

 

Boss: OMG Eomer isn't on the FRONT PAGE!?!?!!!! How did this happen!? He's my favorite hero! 

 

And thus they swapped out Mystery elf with the obvious first choice: Eomer!

 

That's my theory on how it went down anyway.

Ents?

 

Like "Exhaust Ent when he enters play. Don't ready Ent during the refresh phase. Action: ready Ent when your threat is 49."

 

That kind of Ent?

Just this afternoon I was thinking about what an Ent ally would look like. 

 

My take on it was something like "Skinbark does not ready during the refresh phase. Action: exhaust a Hobbit hero or hero with more Willpower than Skinbark to place a progress token on Skinbark. Refresh Action: If Skinbark has a number of progress tokens at least equal to his willpower, discard a progress token to ready Skinbark."

 

A bit overly complicated with the two actions, but somehow their slowness needs to be modelled I feel.

In all honesty, I hope they do make Ents only playable once a game or perhaps force the players to wait long periods of time after each use, because no player should ever be hasty in using Ents.

i think ents fit perfectly in with the new doomed way of paying for cards. because doomed= threat increase = game turns, paying for cards in this way is paying for ents in 'time'

How about something like Ents enter play exhausted and don't ready until they take damage? Simple, but flavourful.

There is also the Time X mechanic they discussed in the Voice of Isengard being introduced.

 

I could see Ents with a Time 3 or 4 where you have to pay to bring them into play, but they stay exhausted until the Time is up.

This is almost certainly going to be the case. 

 

Ents enter play exhausted with time X. After x turns they can be used normally.

Alternatively it could be, When an Ent exhausts it gains time X. Ents can only ready when they have no time counters.

Although I like the idea of cards that can only be played when you have threat over a certain amount (or like a reverse secrecy) I'm not sure they would be a good design. Threat is basically the game's way of saying you're running out of time. Cards that get better as you run out of time would probably be too good. You can 100% rely on the end game threat state to to occur.

The only way to balance it would be if it was threat 49 (maybe 48). Which is essentially saying, do you want to hold out for the super version of the card (at the risk of losing the game if your threat spikes just before you use it). That might be good for moments of tension but might be overall bad for game play - and difficult to design for in a balanced way I think. In any case we already have the tense feeling of last second save when you're at threat 48 or 49 - making cards that just do that better is a form of power creep and probably nothing else.

In any case I want them to add card themes that are better able to resist the shadow (As a Noldor trait probably). I'm hoping to see a hero that has something like: "For every Noldor hero you control your maximum threat before losing is increased by 2" or even better for every Noldor in play increase your maximum threat by 1 - which would be great thematically with their allies that you have to pay cards to keep in play.

You won't fall to the shadow but eventually their low numbers will force them to retreat ... to the west. Once they start retreating you may suddenly lose - and certainly will when a critical number depart you.

also, the player may pay Radagast's resources to remove the resource token on the ent card.

 

then the ents may join the battle quickly with Radagast.

I really am not a super fan of objective allies but maybe that will change if I get to play my palantir deck more often. So far I haven't played it in a scenario with anything useful in the encounter deck. Too busy trying to play thematic decks of the Fellowship going through the new Black Rider's scenarios. With 3 players and 7 heroes pre-chosen for us... it has been difficult to say the least.

You can bring eagles into Moria. They're not going to sacrifice the playability of ents in a player deck just to be somewhat realistic witht the theme.

 

Also, am I the only one who thinks we're NOT going to see ents as a suppoerted theme in this cycle?

I think they'll be there. Perhaps not as a theme per se, but they'll be there. Perhaps in conjunction to the Time X or Doomed X, or be just like the Beornings were in the Mirkwood Cycle. Remember those cats (bears)?

I think it's a save bet we'll see two prime Rohan heroes in the box. My wild guess is Erkenbrand. (prolly leadership)

Reason: Khazad-Dum gave us two dwarf heroes and Heirs of Numenor gave us two gondor heroes.

The deluxe boxes usually give us heroes that fit the theme, while the cycles seem to be able to give us any random jellyfish they like to add.

## 146 [Gizlivadi on September 5, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=858741)

First, I don't think that the theme of this box "is" Rohan. it's just a part of it. Second, Heirs of Numenor gave us a Tactics hero and a Leadership hero. I don't think we'll see Leadership Erkenbrand in this box since that'd be the same as the last one. I think we'll see either a Spirit hero or a Lore hero (most likely Haldir).

Yeah the warhorse totally made my day too! - I see this card getting proxied... i'm far too impatience to wait!

 

As has been previously mentioned by others I would have preferred warhorses to have a limit of 1 per hero rather than restricted... but... the possibility of Eomer making 3 x 5 strength attacks in a round, using 2 warhorses also works for me.

Well, he is the LORD of Westfold, and governs Helm's deep. Sounds like a leadership candidate to me.

Though he's also described as a great warrior. Which also makes him a tactics candidate. Just not in this box.

Any hero can be any sphere by now really...look at lore pippin... Stil: Lippin > Spippin any day.

I do hope you are correct. I'd love to see more Elves, as they are my favorite characters.

Though you must agree FFG does not really care about long overdue or timing.

I can point again at Pippin here....2 Pippins in a row...

I would not like another eowyn or legolas hero to be honest.

There are so many that could fit this cycle and never been used before

I'm all for a new Tactics Eowyn for the last saga expansion, but yeah I hope the developers focus more on characters we haven't seen before. And I really hope we don't see a new Aragorn or a new Legolas or Gimli heroes in the next saga, I believe we'll see ally versions of those characters.

 

As for the next cycle, we don't really know if the player cards for it will focus on Rohan so much. If we take the last cycle as an example, there was lots of Outlands support and some support for Gondor but we also got a Hobbit centric pack and we got Mirlonde and whatnot, so I would not be so sure we will see Erkenbrand or Gamling though I hope we do.

Nah. He'll be an objective ally in Voice of Isengard, but not a hero. It would mess up too much with the saga storyline, and there's just no real reason to make him a hero or an ally. So yeah, we know he was a good guy at some point in the somewhat distant past, but we know too little about him and he's just not relevant at that point in the story.

Has anyone pointed out yet how interesting the 1A side of "To Catch an Orc" looks? It's on the preview article page and it says that at the beginning of the game, we take the top 20 cards of our deck and set them aside and shuffle an orc guard (of the Orc we're trying to find) into our deck!

They're not completely worthless. Some cards (like palantir) interact with Noble trait and ranger's cards interact with Ranger trait. But I guess that they will add more such cards, and maybe even some treacheries like "each warrior gets -1attack till the end of round"

I hope we see a preview for VoI, but I would especially like to see a preview for the upcoming Ringmaker AP cycle. Based on how important the story line was for Against the Shadow and the Black Riders, I expect these new AP's to be a story and thematic homerun. My gut is telling me that this game has found its groove and the best is yet to come. I'm pumped  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Totally agree with you! I am so excited about that cycle. 

 

I think (and hope) they will make bigger emphasis on quests and encounter cards. 

 

I have big expectations as every cycle has better quests than the previous one IMO. And the previews are amazing, especially the last one with the Dunland enemies. I hope I will have enough money to buy this one right after publication.

 

 

Sorry for my bad English :/... I am from Slovakia.

Much like everyone else I'm still eagerly anticipating the reveal of the 2nd hero (who i'm still standing by with my deduction of Haldir based almost soley on the original art that was shown then removed).  Regardless I think whichever faction or trait that 2nd hero belongs to will set the tone for the lore and spirit cards in the set.  Correct me if i'm wrong but i think the only preview card shown thus far for either of those two spheres has been the card draw doomed card.  It seems like each cycle now will try to tackle a couple game play options.  Against the shadow was gondor, ranger, outlands, and monosphere...I expect the ring maker cycle to expand on Rohan, Orthanic, Doomed, and whatever trait the 2nd hero belongs too (assuming its not also Rohan in which case i'm stupid and this has been a waste of writing)

I also hope we get a new preview article sometime this week, preferably tomorrow.  I am really getting excited for the possibilities revolving around Fangorn Forest, and all the untapped player cards that could bring into the game.  I think it would be great if we get a battle-heavy Dunland quest and a more location/treachery based forest one. 

## 189 [Scroll Lock on December 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=933700)

We have seen lore and leadership doomed events. What do you think tactics/spirit will be?

IMO Tactics one will be direct damage. But spirit... I am not sure. It probably wont be threat reduction

(LOL). I was thinking about direct questing. Something like "place Y resource tokens on one location in play."

Direct questing? I think something like "doomed X. Ready all your characters and have another quest phase without revealing another encounter card (or maybe with revealing?? hmm). You must use the allies readied by this effect to quest again. X is the number of character exhausted characters you control when playing this event." But I think this is too complicated... Hmm but I actually love complicated player cards...

In ''turtle" quests maybe yes, as long as you can control your threat.

Though Caleb has stated that he wanted to counter this popular tactic in VoI.

Hence the time X mechaninc; making the doomed X possibly quite high as a cost in the new quests.

 

This is all in theory of course. nothing certain.

But if so, Loreagorn will be everyone's new favorite hero.

I hope that in Voice of Isengard and the Ring-maker cycle we see a theme of magic rings similar to Meccg when you tested a gold ring to see what it is and all that. Maybe we even get to see more Palantiri (specific please this time, all seven seeing stones were described in detail and we have enough material).

I wonder how' they're gonna deal with compatibility issues with Saruman and the rest of the saga expansions in which he has become a traitor. Maybe a permanent burden called Saruman's Treachery or something that removes all Saruman player cards from the game.

That may very well be the case. You're right in that the designers don't always make the saga quests literal recreations of that part of the books, and that it doesn't have to restrict you to make it exactly the same. I think it's better this way.

Side note: I feel like I do take the saga expansions much more seriously in regards to theme than the cycles. I don't think I've played any of the hobbit quests without Dwarf decks nor the black riders without the hobbits but I have no issues taking elves into sieges of Minas Tirith ha

Pretty much this. Otherwise Gandalf could have been unusable in several Hobbit Quests (where he went away in the story), or in Black Riders (where he had business with Saruman).

I was thinking about the deluxe and next cycle possibilities last night and, while this is all just random bumbling on my part, I thought I'd share it all the same. 

 

Now that they seem to be committed to saga expansions for the Lord of the Rings itself, I feel they may start to stay away from the 'core' locations because they will be covered in those expansions. The fact that we're getting Dunlendings makes me think that perhaps we'll be looking west towards Swanfleet and Tharbad, rather than east towards Fangorn and Rohan, even if we are going to see Rohan player cards. 

 

I'm usually wrong on these things, but thought I'd share my musings, anyway  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

@spalanzani I certainly hope so! Exploring those little known places would be great, and I don't think we'll get a Helm's Deep rehash which is probably what would happen had the sagas not been made.

Gamlimg is a pretty cool Rohan character and if he did come out he would probably be leadership sphere as he lead some forces.

He may come out in saga but remember that FFG has made duplicates in the past so we might get 2 copies.

too soon for a new Theoden? jkjk (but really FFG...a Rohan-centric leadership Theoden is what we all want)

 

From the Rohan side I'd like to see Erkenbrand, wouldnt mind a new Eowyn either

 

Silvan wise I hope we get a Haldir featuring the art that was originally spoiled, would be cool to see Galadriel or Celeborn too

Since it's called "The Ringmaker Cycle" I really wonder if we won't see Galadriel. (I believe it was actually Celebrimbor who made all of the rings except for The One Ring, but I doubt we'll see him.). The real wild card is what they plan to do with the third saga expansion, but I think Erkenbrand and Haldir are a given. I want an Arwen at some point, but this might not be the right place.

I think Theoden as an ally would make a lot of sense. They did it for Denethor, why not Theoden? They could even bundle him with the highly anticipated "Snowmane" card that would give him a big boost (like Vilya for Elrond) and would also apply to the hero version. This would make the hero version much more palatable to a lot of players.

HaHa, I think black riders was a bit of an exception given that it was a saga expansion. I don't doubt at all that'll we'll see another Theoden in the first or second Two Towers box but I would be surprised (albeit pleasantly) if we got a new one in this cycle.

The ally idea is interesting, hopefully they could find a balanced idea for it so it doesn't make its equivalent hero not as significant (like ally vs hero Faramir) but also isn't so weak or burdened that it's never played compared to the hero (like ally vs hero Denethor)

I would like to see a leadership hero with a skill that only apply(or work) if all your heroes are leadership (because the outland one is not really an equivalent to Theoden, Caldara and mirlonde).

With the release of Grima I have to say I am surprised but I do like him, good willpower, low threat, 2 good traits if the cycle works out well and a ability I love. With master of lore and him you can play high cost allies like gildor and haldir for really cheap or with grima you can play events or other cheap cost items for free if master of lore is on the board.

All the people (myself included) were thinking about another Rohan character liker Erkenbrand or maybe an elf. And they gave us a Rohan character indeed!

 

100% surprised about Gríma as a hero, but 100% pleased. He's a good reductor, like Master of Lore and also plays with the doomed keyword of this Expansion.

An interesting bit about this is that they specifically mention in the newest preview article (I'd quote it but I'm on my phone and can't accurately copy it) that this expansion only contains Rohan and Isengard traited cards...so I'd wager that the spirit cards are Rohan themed to continue the path originally set with all the spirit Rohan characters during the shadows of mirkwood cycle, or are just non-specific cards altogether

It wasn't a ring of power but still a magic ring. There were many magic rings in middle earth besides the rings of power, like the many lesser rings that Celebrimor made as practice for the others, and Saruman made a ring of his own, so I hope we see more rings in the Ring maker cycle.

Indeed... For now we have the following cards revealed:

1 Éomer Hero Tactics
2 Gríma Hero Lore
3 Saruman Ally Neutral
4 Orthanc Guard Ally Leadership
5 Isengard Messenger Ally Lore
6 Westfold Outrider Ally Tactics
7 ------------
8 Rohan Warhorse Attachment Tactics
9 ------------
10 -----------
11 Legacy of Numenor Event Leadership
12 Deep Knowledge Event Lore
 
Worth mention that in the other expansions
Khazad-dum got 13 player cards and
Heirs of Numenor got 18 player cards.

You forgot Keys of Orthanc, which I believe is #10. Assuming they continue in the sphere pattern, #7 is either a Spirit ally or a Leadership/Lore attachment. #9 should be a Spirit attachment. I also bet that both Spirit and Tactics will get Doomed events, so that makes 14 cards, assuming that there isn't also a neutral event.

7- spirit ally (I hope, we will get some awesowe expensive spirit rohan ally)

9- some attachment

10-keys of orthanc

13- spirit doomed event

14-tactics doomed event

9 may be some attachmemt(probably leadership or lore), that would allow attached hero to spend resources for Doomed cards from any sphere.

I've read the articles about VoI and couldn't find Keys of Orthanc... Could you point it?

 

I agree that 13 and 14 should be Doomed cards for Tactics and Spirit...

 

Following the other expansions pattern, we shouldn't get any more neutral cards. KD got Boots from Erebor and HoN got Envoy of Pelargir and we already have our neutral card here

I can't imagine what a Tactics Doomed card would be.  It would have to be very powerful to make it worth raising your threat in a tactics deck.  Something like:

0 cost
Doomed 2
Discard a non-unique enemy from play.

I think a great Spirit doomed card would be:

0 cost
Doomed 3
Cancel the when revealed effects of a card just revealed from the encounter deck. 

It would give you more cancellation than just a Test of Will, and present you with some interesting tactical decisions between raising your threat and canceling a treachery.  It would make a doomed Spirit-Lore solo deck with Strider too powerful though, and those already seem like they will be ridiculous in solo play.

Fun to speculate and hopefully we don't have to wait too much longer.

If the events are "Doomed", then they would probably have an effect for each player, so neither of those effects are likely. I have an idea for the Tactics event, but I kinda doubt it's right. As for Spirit, it could ready a character for each player, or something like that.

was originally thinking the tactics one may deal direct damage but considering how the two revealed thus far very specifically benefit each individual player my guess is that it will grant possibly a +1 to each characters ATK and DEF for the turn

## 259 [Glowwyrm on January 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=946624)

I see both of those events as effecting all the players, especially the Spirit one because it outright cancels a treachery that would presumably effect every player.  The Tactics one has less obvious benefit for other players, but if you're the Tactics player, hopefully you aren't worried about your engaged enemies, and you're using it to protect other players.

I think a readying effect for Spirit or a global willpower boost would be very possible.

These are just wild guesses about cards anyway from a guy who really wants to see a tactics siege weapon that can destroy locations.  I can dream...

## 260 [CaptainAce on January 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=946685)

That seige weapon sounds awesome as tactics is my favorite sphere and it would help make solo a bigger possibility because right now it's hama with trained for war and theoden as only helpful questing/location cards.

Doomed events will be as simple as those 2 we have seen yet.

Maybe something like this.

TACTICS

Each player deals 3 damage to one enemy engaged with him.

SPIRIT

Each player readies one character he controls.

Or each player ignores "when revealed" effects or treacheries in general in this turn (must be played before the staging, or something). That could add some more importance to scrying cards like Palantír.

Now seriously: These small victories (tactics Rohan, Dunland, Ents, new mechanic, surprising hero, old threat cost color and design) make VoI very nice box, Caleb did great job with his team.

My guess is as good as any, but I think it should change to shipping status within the next 2 weeks.

This game is doing well and I wouldn't take anything from the lack of info. I agree that the lack of preview articles is frustrating.

So how many of you have already decided what deck you will use for the first VoI quests?

I'm planning on taking my elves to Dunland!

## 282 [Tracker1 on February 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=970617)

I'm thinking my Caldera deck, and then something completly new with the new player cards.

## 283 [booored on February 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=970719)

I'll be making a new deck, there are some very powerful cards in the spoilers.. so I think there will be some fun options for new decks.

I like to make decks for each quest. I dislike making single decks and using them all the time, I get board of using them. I prefer to make a deck for a single quest that crushes it into dust, then for fun i play it vs others.

## 284 [Scroll Lock on February 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=970805)

I haven't been thinking about this. But I will probably try out Tactics/Spirit Rohan. Astonishing speed will be key against Time X mechanic.

## 285 [Karlson on February 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=970815)

Definitely a Rohan themed set of decks.

## 288 [kyrie on February 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=971131)

Grima/Aragorn (Lore)/Glorfindel (Spirit) Doomed Deck

 

I have a feeling it will be overpowered but really fun.

## 289 [Scroll Lock on February 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=971212)

Yes, I definitely want to try out Grima, Keys of Orthanc, Orthanc Guard and all these things. Probably Grima-Mirlonde-Elrond deck. Not very thematic, but I think it will work well.

And if that Fangorn quest wont use Battle/Siege I will play it with Hobbits!

## 290 [chuckles on February 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=971383)

Most likely start with a Silvan themed deck (will proxy; Celeborn, Naith Scout & The Tree People)... next most likely is a Rohan, Orthanc, doomed affair...

depends, I expect there will be some strong threat reduction in this set. Possibly even outside spirit in the form of a attachment or something.

This is what worries me about this set the most. The Doom keyword will in all likely hood add more threat reduction witch in turn will make many of the old er quest fart far easier.

I'm just guessing.. but I think this could happen.

Exactly.. this is why I fear there will be a bunch of threat reduction incoming. The ones spoiled could have been spoiled as they are the new "shiny" mechanism. It seams a logical progression to assume this will be offset with new threat reduction cards.

I hope they do not as a influx of strong threat reduction will greatly alter the difficulty of older quests.

I think they will not do it. This is not wise from any points. From game prospective and commercials prospective as well.

## 297 [Style75 on February 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=972527)

I think they will definitely give more threat reduction but it will be conditional.... you'll have to do something to earn it. Think of how card draw was added to tactics; kill something, play a card and tap a weapon to get the card draw. You can do it, but you've got to set up the combo. Compare this to lore sphere card draw which is just a straight up effect.

 

I think this is the best way to approach sphere specialties. Each sphere is really good at something and can do that job easily through straightforward card effects. Other spheres will be able to do it, but have to work harder at it, often involving combo cards or achieving specific events in the game.

 

This way you can let monosphere decks still play the game, but the spheres retain their special flavor.

## 298 [booored on February 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=972535)

I like those ideas for threat reduction... lets hope your right.

i am not sure why mono-sphere should be encouraged... I mean why would anyone want to play mono... like i know you can and there are cards now that are for it.. and I guess you should be able to if you want.. but I fail to see the draw to it.

## 299 [Thanatopsis on February 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=972583)

> i am not sure why mono-sphere should be encouraged... I mean why would anyone want to play mono... like i know you can and there are cards now that are for it.. and I guess you should be able to if you want.. but I fail to see the draw to it.

 

Monosphere allows greater depth within a sphere.  If I'm gaining three of the same resource every turn and can fill a deck with 50 cards of the same sphere, there is greater opportunity to draw and play more powerful cards. 

 

Of course with the added depth comes a lack of breadth across multi-spheres.  As with all deck building, it's a balance.

 

Ex/ Gildor in a tri-sphere deck is tricky to get into play. Either wait five turns or build a combo (and then there is the opportunity cost of what Lore cards could have been played in the interim).  In a mono-Lore deck, Gildor can come out in two turns and we don't have to feel as guilty putting three copies into the deck.

## 300 [Style75 on February 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=972591)

I enjoy pretty much every way to play this game: solo, solo 2 handed, and multiplayer using monosphere, dual sphere, tri sphere and even quad sphere decks. It's all fun!  Monosphere should be just as valid a concept as a multisphere deck so it's important that the developers send a few cards its way to ensure it stays competitive. The best of these are like "foe-hammer" where they provide a benefit to non-monosphere decks as well, but it's important to have a few of those monosphere only cards like "Book of Eldacar" to give the occasional big boost to monosphere. I certainly don't want to see them all the time, but every now and then is fine by me.

## 301 [booored on February 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=972602)

Foe-Hammer isn't a mono sphere card in any way...

 

> Of course with the added depth comes a lack of breadth across multi-spheres.  As with all deck building, it's a balance.

 

There is no ballence in a mono-sphere deck.

 

As I though, I understand that the mono-sphere decks need to be at least viable and able to be used if you wish.. I just do not see why anyone would choose to. The very nature of them restricts you to only a sinlge deck, and single play style. You have no flexability in your game... it is just the exact opposite of what deck building is about, witch for me is building a deck of answers.

I really hope ring-maker will bring some love for 2heroes deck. Probably yes, as we will see Secrecy.

Honestly, I can not imagine some card that gives some specific advantages to 2-heroes deck, but I am sure Caleb can make something innovative with his team.

I really like secrecy, but it is not built yet. I think (and hope) its main sphere will be spirit. Maybe some Silvan hero, that reduces your threat for playing secrecy cards... I can only dream.

## 304 [Thanatopsis on February 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=972728)

Moderator: Would it be possible to create a new thread on monosphere decks and transfer the applicable posts on this thread over?  We're getting a little off-topic.

 

> Foe-Hammer isn't a mono sphere card in any way...  [et al.] 

 

Any card that shores up a sphere's weaknesses can be considered a strong monosphere card: for Tactics cards that aid in resource acceleration (Horn of Gondor), card draw (foe-hammer), and healing (Gondorian Discipline) are all strong candidates for a mono-tactics deck. 

 

A Four player game is the opposite extreme that will build a case for monosphere decks.  Four quad sphere decks will not be as efficient as four monosphere decks.  Each of the monosphere decks will have the depth needed to use the best cards possible.  Breadth is attained by all four decks working together.

 

Now, this efficiency is reduced as we go from 4 to 3 to 2 to 1 player.  And, it is at its worse with one player.

 

> it is just the exact opposite of what deck building is about, witch for me is building a deck of answers.

 

Here is a not so clever analogy. 

A "Deck of Answers" is like always having the right shaped peg to fit into the right shaped hole.  There is a balance of spheres that will be able to confront any challenge. 

A monosphere deck is like having only one peg that is made out of steel, and you have a very large hammer.  Even if a square hole comes along, you just slam that peg through the hole anyway to solve the problem. The bluntness of this approach is softened by monosphere friendly cards that soften a deck and start to make it well rounded. 

 

ex/ who needs healing when a direct damage tactics deck kills enemies before they can even attack in the first place.

Just a little tidbit for you guys, I asked Cristi Balenescu about his illustration for one of the VoI quest cards.

It depicted a scene of battle with a lone rider moving away. He confirmed that this is Grima fleeing the battle. Might suggest getting Grima as an objective ally...

It is a FFG game.. there will be tons of expansions!

 

Even if it wasn't it is a wargame, it just uses discs instead of minis. So it is even easier for FFG to produce new units for commanders to field. I would expect new races, units, scenarios in addition to new mechanisms in a fairly regular cycle.

The cardboard of the rings podcast [http://cardboardoftherings.com/] did a really good interview with him after he was hired by FFG (See episode 46). He talks about the process of designing the sets including the playtesting. It's fascinating stuff and definitely worth listening to. IIRC, the first set he had a hand in was Black Riders which was then follow by VoI and the Ringmaker cycle so we are only just now seeing his handywork (along with Caleb of course).  My gut feeling tells me that the game is getting a lot of TLC from Caleb and Matt and the upcoming AP cycle and saga sets will be the best yet.

They have a new keyword: Hinder

 

They don't get shadow cards, they don't attack, and each round they are engaged with you they remove progress from the quest/active location.

 

also, the individual huorn enemies all have effects when they are engaged with you (deals damages, raises your threat more per round, removes resources, etc).

Played through first quest last night. If you don't want spoilers, time to look away!

 

 

 

SPOILERS

 

First quest is the one that deals with Dunlendings. It's a combat-heavy quest that piles on the enemies, and the hand size and card draw hate is pretty intense. At the same time, you need a lot of willpower to quest through quickly to avoid the time effects. Grima is an objective ally that you have to shepherd to safety, so you can't use him for this scenario. It's hard to put a difficulty on it after playing it once with old decks I had laying around, but I'd say it's challenging but beatable (this is two-handed, by the way).

Just out of curiosity... what Grima objective ally does? Does he has the same art as hero?

By the way, thanks you for shedding some light on huorns... but there is a spoiled trechery which makes every huorn make an immediate attack... and you just said they don't attack. Or they don't attack on their own, just as a cause of trechery?

I'll try to spoil a couple of encounter cards tonight, if people are interested. The Grima objective has different art, but the same stats (if i remember correctly). He has "Action: Draw a card." and you lose the game if he leaves play.

I do like the art better. It's more of a close-up, but he looks pretty **** evil. Between his appearance and the name Wormtongue, he's practically shouting "villain" from the rooftops. Get it together, heroes!

Just picked up my copy.  Not too much to add at this time except that there is a story line in the rule set with the obligatory "DO NOT READ PAST THIS POINT UNLESS YOU HAVE COMPLETED THE QUEST."

 

So I didn't.  The first quest is a fight at the Fords of the Isen and I'll try to record a round report over the weekend.  I'm probably going to use my elves deck first and may not include any new cards.

 

One last comment is that the overall card art is very good.

I have a question for all of you that have the expansion.

 

Has the card Legacy of Númenor, the leadership one with Doomed, a value of Doomed 3 or 4? 

 

I have a copy of VoI and those cards have Doomed 4, but on the preview here at FFG it reads Doomed 3.

 

Also, I understand that there are copies of encounter cards that have the golden circle for "normal to easy mode", but not all the copies of that same card must have the golden circle, am I correct?

yes, the card is now Doomed 4 - probably a good change, IMHO.

 

and yes, you don't always remove every single copy of a card - sometimes just a couple - for easy mode (or even for nightmare mode) - only cards with the gold ring.

I've now played the first quest four times. The first two times were with my elves deck and it got destroyed. The enemies are powerful and can come at you in bunches. My elves ramp into a great late game, but need to lay low for the first few turns and weren't able to do it here. So I switched back to my Glory, Strider, Tactomir deck and am two for two, but the second one was really close.

I would put the first quest, rated a 5, about equal to Into Ithilien. I'm going to make a session report now, but it will take a little while.

## 361 [kyrie on February 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=992668)

I have played the first two quests using a solo Doomed deck with Loragorn, Grima (which technically is cheating on the first one), and Spirit Glorfindel. The deck was able to pump cards out like crazy, with either Saruman or Gandalf once every turn (Saruman is so cheap, and with Grima all you need is 4 resources for Gandalf which is easy because the Keys of Orthanc gives you an extra resource a turn pretty much).

 

I went 1 for 2 on the first quest, which is labelled a 5; and I went 1 for 3 on the second quest, which is labeled a 4.

 

That being said, to me, the quests seem to be more difficult than Heirs of Numenor, not because of the enemies, but because of the card draw hate as well as the new time mechanic. A lot of the quest cards only give you 2 time counters until the the bad effect goes off, which sometimes takes only one turn to go off due to encounter card treacheries. I have yet to try it double-fisted, but my guess is that it will be harder the more players you have, since the time mechanic remains the same, but more opportunity to trigger treacheries which decrease how much time you have.

Played the second quest and won it. Fun quest with a lot of tough Orc enemies, about equal to Peril in Pelargir in difficulty I think. There is no "hand size hate" in this quest, but there is a very interesting mechanic in searching for Mugash "the Orc".

Will play it again a few times before moving on to quest three, which should be pretty brutal if history serves.

Wow, your tearing through these, six months of waiting finished off in a day! So, it seems the quests may be difficult but not HoN difficult which took me many attempts before getting any wins. Do you think the scenarios have good replayability? Seems like you had to do very little deck tweaking to complete these. I was hoping these would keep me busy while waiting for the first AP, but it seems like your managing them quite easily. I hope the third scenario makes you work for it and provides a bit of a frustrating challenge to overcome.

The good news for Glaurung is that I played the second quest again and just got pistol whipped! So there are some bad encounter deck combos out there. I put these quests along with the Heirs box in general difficulty, harder than most of the Steward's Fear cycle. (But I haven't seen the last one yet.)

I haven't encountered the Toughness keyword yet,

played all 3 three-player today.

 

quest 3 is rated the most difficult but is joke. won in it a two or three rounds.

 

quest 1 is probably the most difficult.

 

quest 2 is also somewhat difficult.

 

i will likely replay 1 and 2 - but 3 is a dud.

Oh :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]  

How many times did you play Quest 3? like could it have been some really lucky cards draws?  And do you think the 3rd quest could be harder solo or still just a joke?

Do you think quest 3 is a number of players thing? Do you think it could be more difficult solo?

Two mores games on #2 - a loss and a win.  So overall I'm about 50% using my best deck.  Also, I AM adjusting the deck pretty heavily for the quests.  I like both quests in that if you stumble the encounter deck - and especially the Time mechanic - can really punish you.  Quest 2 in particular attacks your deck in a totally new way and really required boarding.

 

I probably won't get to #3 for a couple of days.

I played through all three quests two fisted with thematic (but strong) Gondor-Rohan decks that also make use of the new Isengard cards.  My heroes: Eowyn-Eleanor-Eomer and Strider-Imrahil-Theodred.  I put every single new card in the pack to good use, which was fun, and I didn't have to change my decks for any of the quests (though the second one would have been easier if I had).

The first quest is tough and tense, but manageable.  Very fun and replayable.

I lost the second quest six or seven times before I beat it.  Several times I got pounded into oblivion.  Other times I got really close, but lost.  It is the best designed quest, the most thematic, and the toughest.

I won the third quest in three rounds on my first try without knowing what was coming.  It was ridiculously easy and really straightforward. 

The added narrative sections are fun too, and the encounter card art is great.  Loved everything about the box but the third quest.

I really liked these three quests! I built two decks between the three and while I don't think these are the hardest scenarios out there, I think we have plenty of those already. I'm glad this wasn't more HoN. I'm was getting kind of sick of round 2 defeats just because of a few bad cards popping up.

Quest 3 could be more difficult solo, if only because it can take a little longer to pile on progress.  Derek from The Grey Company podcast posted a pic on their Facebook page from a solo game in which he was down to one hero and two allies.  I plan on trying the quests out solo sometime, now that I've finished two-fisted.

Beat first quest on second try and second quest on first try. Still need to play the last quest. In my experience (and I've found that difficulty in this game is really subjective), this box is definitely not on the same level as Heirs in terms of difficulty. That being said, I do really like the creative mechanics enough that I'll probably be inspired to play through the quests again quite a few times with different types of decks.

Can someone try to grasp the design on the Saruman card that basically exiles a creature from the game. I know this is a mechanic that somehow finds its way into every cardgame as it's been in MtG, WoW, GoT recently, among others. But why on Saruman? Because they want him being played a lot, given the ability has always been quite awesome.

 

I'm guessing that - being a wizard - he can put an enemy into stasis or something. I haven't read the books though. Is there something you could see?

That's a great question, and one that I've been pondering for awhile. I can think of a few possibilities:

 

1) Saruman is able to use his powers to foresee danger and help the heroes avoid it.

2) Saruman is already corrupt and actually in league with dark forces to some degree, so he can selectively manipulate them to clear the hero's path.

3) Saruman is known for being extremely persuasive (that's why the box is called "voice of isengard", because his voice is almost magical in its ability to persuade), so perhaps he "persuades" an enemy or location to get the heck out of the way.

I thought it had more to do with #3, but I can see the argument for #2.

 

Also, for what it's worth, I lost my first game of the third quest in four turns.  Kept a bad opening hand and got hit with two bad treacheries that I couldn't deal with.  (I was playing solo one handed with the same deck that I used on quest 2.  Will need more side boarding.)

It'll be very interesting to see how the general fan base responds to easier quests this time around. If you were around here when HoN released, there was a firestorm of complaint over how hard the quests were. I wonder if the designers took that to heart and dialed it down a little (or a lot!)?  I can see the designers shaking their heads in disbelief if the majority of people complain about easy quests  :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

I can only speak for the first two quests and I don't think they are that much easier frankly. Remember that we didn't have any of the AtS cards at the release of Heirs, or Black Riders either I believe. If I lose those cards from my decks I think things are about the same. Furthermore, I'll admit my skin had thickened since Heirs as it forced me to build really powerful decks and expect to lose more.

## 390 [chuckles on February 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=994702)

yes I remember that Style75, I was a fairly new player at the time and aforementioned flames of complaint almost put me off the game for good. You may have thought the world was ending.

 

I think that Heirs was only a show stopper until people figured out that they needed to majorly rethink their decks to allow for the new mechanics. I don't think that VoI was ever going to really stump people the same way. As even if it was/is? comparably as hard a lot of players will already have in mind that, new mechanics may mean not just tweaking but major deck rethinking/building... and once you know the 'trick' to a quest they are generally quite straight forward to build for.

 

The designers are in a tough spot as they are wanting to keep bringing new people into the game & keep the existing players all Larry like... Hopefully easy mode helps... or maybe introduce a super easy mode ...and harder Quests ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

For at least a little while, I see quests just being very different rather than really escalating in difficulty for a few reasons:

 

1) The more you escalate the power of the quests, the more you need to escalate the power of the card pool. This would cause the power gap between the core set and the latest sets to be too large.

 

2) Nightmare and Easy modes were promoted more after Heirs of Numenor was released, so the designers can allow those play modes to do the greater adjustments to the game difficulty instead of just escalating the difficulty of quests as we go.

 

3) The game seems to be header toward more trait-based and synergistic decks with slightly weaker player cards to offer more options instead of increasing the power of the cards.

to be clear, i'm not complaining (and i know you weren't specifically saying i was).

 

it is a bit of a let down to win a quest on the first go without really knowing what you are doing (a la the 3rd quest in the box). we did have to replay the 1st and 2nd but still managed victories without tweaking decks.

 

i think the quests are fun and interesting enough to replay. and that's the most important thing to me, at this point. not every quest has to smash my head in, but on the flip side, i don't think we need anymore quests that can be won in a couple turns on your first try w/o tweaking decks (and yet somehow it got the highest difficulty rating...).

What kind of decks are you guys using to get turn 3 wins on Into Fangorn? Are you playing solo or two handed? Anyone feel like writing a round report?

i haven't played solo in years, as i don't really think you get a "full" gaming experience that way. encounter decks simply don't "shine" when you only flip one card.

 

so, i played these quests 3 player. one player was leadership-ish dwarves (dain, thorin, bifur), i used designer-Matt's rohan deck posted on the site (well, a tweaked version of it), and the 3rd player used mono-tactics, if i remember correctly.

 

so yes, you do need a decent amount of willpower, between the dwarves and some rohan WP, we blasted through it and the tactics player could take a tree or two down to reduce threat slightly. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I can attest to Dain, the third quest is a little easy, but I am assuming it would be more difficult if you were forced to go to stage 3 (if you are quick enough you can breeze by it and avoid a lot of trouble).

 

However, if you are wanting to up the challenge, you can just house-rule that the Huorn enemies do attack during the combat phase in addition to their hinder key word. That would make the quest very, very, difficult, in my opinion, because they have such a high attack strength and are really difficult to kill. I think I am going to try that out as a bit of "nightmare" mode.

For the third quest, two-fisted I used a Rohan deck and a Gondor/Loragorn deck that pumped out willpower with Eowyn/Rohan allies for one and with lots of allies and Sword that was Broken for the other.  The Lore and Leadership doomed cards made the victory easy, because they jump-started both decks.

SPOILERS but, the quest three is really thematic.  If a bunch of trees attack you, and you run away really fast, you'll probably be ok. 

And no complaints about the box except for quest three, only because it was so simple to solve.  Art is great, player cards are great, first two quests are great, storyline is great, theme is great.  A great box, and one of the best purchases in the game I've made.

Played Into Fangorn twice tonight and I beat it both times without too much trouble. I hate to say it, but it is a bit easy, mostly because the Huorns don't attack and so you can just quest like crazy and there's only two real quest stages. I'm not slamming the quest, but I just wish it was a bit more difficult, as I really love the idea behind the quest.

 

For the record, two-handed with Frodo/Eowyn/Glor on one side and Eomer/Beregond/Imrahil on the other. Second game, I replaced the mono-Spirit deck with Grima/Glor/Loragorn.

Just played 1st scenario with solo Caldera deck. Got a victory in 12 rounds, but it was not easy. Sort of reminds me of Drudan forest, but much more difficult solo. My Caldera deck had no card draw in it, and I was still getting pretty beat up, decks built with a serious draw engine are going to get slamed. Overall, I liked it and the encounter cards and quest cards worked really well together. Time mechanic is great and does add a sense of urgency, since time running out = very bad stuff, and it added a lot of tension to the game.

My theory is the reason why Into Fangorn is so easy is because the quest is meant to lull you into a false sense of security. The next quest is Dunland Trap.... notice the word trap in the title?

Perhaps you're on to something there.  I had to reread the effect of the hinder attribute several times to make sure I was playing it correctly... it just seems so under-powered.  I beat this quest on only the fourth round without any attacks, just a couple of the Huorns "hindering" a couple progress off from the quest.  Maybe it was beginner's luck and this quest plays out differently depending on card draw, but I would agree that it seems way too easy from my initial experience.

 

"To Catch an Orc," however, brutally thrashed me around 5 or 6 times before I finally achieved a narrow victory.  I don't know what it is about that quest, but I find it to be quite challenging.

The second scenario is also pretty difficult. It took my Caldera deck 4 attempts to get a victory, but in 2 of the losses Mugash showed up in the first cards drawn from the 20 card player deck. The unpredictability of when he shows up will make the difficulty of this quest a bit more random then usual, since an early arrival will be very difficult for many decks to deal with. I even had to capture him again in the end. Not an easy scenario, the Time X mechanic is a really good improvement to game play, it adds a layer to the game that was only present in a few scenarios before, I really like it. I'm very curious how other deck types do on these, but on to 3rd scenario first.

The first two quests don't require much questing power, but the third is all about Will. Conversely you need to fight early and often in the first two and not at all in the third. Add to that the Timed mechanic which basically doesn't let you develop your deck and you get very different construction requirements. So making a solo deck to handle all three reliably is tricky.

Also, please at least state how you are playing (solo one handed, solo two, multi-player) when reporting on the quests. (All of my attempts have been solo one.)

I played all three of these quests in a solo two-handed format with a mono-Tactics deck (Theoden, Eomer, Hama) and the other deck jumping between Leadership-Spirit and Lore-Spirit.  I beat the first quest with the above mentioned Tactics deck as well as Theodred, Dunhere, and Eowyn.  

 

The second quest took some serious reworking before I finally beat it.  I would have to disagree that it doesn't take a lot of willpower; in two player, the locations can really add up fast and destroy your questing phase.  That may not be the case in solo one handed play, however.  Anyways, the player decks that finally gave me the win were Theoden, Eomer, and Legolas paired up with Grima, Glorfindel (spirit), and Eowyn.  I used these same setups to also beat the final quest (twice in a row).

Played solo with Caldera deck on Into Fanghorn, won twice lost once.

The Caldera deck beat all 3 scenarios unmodified, with none of the new player cards. The second scenario was the most difficult, followed by the first then the third.

The third scenario, was not as easy as others made it seem. There can be some nasty combination of encounter cards. When ever i had choice of selecting a Huorn enemy i selected the Dark-hearted one with engagement of 1, and it raises threat by 2. Having a few of them engaged can lead to threat problems and they combo pretty well with one nasty treachery card. Also, the other Huorn enemies are pretty nasty too with some pretty bad forced effects. It kind of reminds me of Return to Mirkwood in that if you dont finish in 5 or 6 rounds with heavy questing you could threat out or be in serious trouble. It seems like it is designed to be a fast race type of quest, and if i modified Caldera deck to include even more questing power it would be even simpler. Overall I think it is pretty cool scenario. I'm happy with all the scenarios, and am excited to try some other decks against them.

Even though I struggled the most with quest two, I think it's my favorite quest out of all three of them.  I need to give the first quest some more attention because I rather rushed through it, but did enjoy that one as well.  However, I felt like the second quest really provided some interesting mechanics that felt unique and interesting.  

The "out of play" deck was a great idea to add an element of suspense and it really varies how the quest unfolds as well.  It could be a long, perilous search throughout the mountain (if Mugash is on the bottom of your deck) or it could prove to be a quick capture and tense fight with the Uruk.  The quest definitely has the potential to feel different each time you play it, and even though it kicked my butt at first, I think it allowed me to enjoy it all the more and makes me excited to play it in the future.

 

I like the setting and unfolding plot of the third quest, but so far, both my playthroughs have been a breeze and over very quickly without incident.  In my opinion, the Huorns should still be able to attack during the combat phase in addition to depleting the active quest of progress.  I just think their "hinder" ability is too weak as is.

Yeah, I think a big problem too is only having two quest stages, which makes it really easy to just blow through the quest. If there were more quest stages, it would give more time for the huorns to pile on players and let hinder and those forced effects do some damage.

 

p.s. I know there's technically three, but the third only comes into play if you don't blow through the quest in the first place.

I think I'll try to purposely let the time tick down and out on the first quest phase so that Mugash can escape into the encounter deck. That will definitely make the quest longer and undoubtedly amp up the challenge as well.

This was from early speculation about the female elf in the banner on VoI page. Looks like it was used on one of the quest cards, so I wonder if that excludes it from being a player card in the future. I thought for sure it would at least be a player card if not hero by the look of it. Oh well.

I would have mixed feelings about it there being another Arwen... not because i wouldn't want Arwen as a hero or another even Ally, but because there aren't that many Elves and I would prefer more in terms of numbers of different cards to choose from rather than different versions of the same Character.... oh the small matter of the current version being pretty jolly awesome.

Ugh, this is very annoying. I have been feeling like I have such a big cardpool that my diversity of decks never ends, and the diversity of quests runs a very wide amount of variety, so I was going to halt acquisitions at this point. It sounds like the quests really are peaking here, though.

I have been playing the 2 nd scenario a lot. It is really pretty challenging solo.

Some spoilers ahead.

The time 2 on the first quest card requires you to quest successfully almost every turn to ensure you can put another time token on the quest card. Usually the first round of questing this is acomplished, but 2nd round with an active location can be difficult to clear and it often requires 8 or more will power to achive, some slow decks that do not have Eowyn and spirit questing power are going to have a challenge with this. If you quest unsuccessfully the 2nd round, you will be down to one time token at the end of the round, and it's likely you will not quest sucessfully third round. At the end of the round when the last time token is removed 2 cards from the encounter deck are revealed. I have not done a through analysis of the threat values of the encounter cards, but it's probably hovering around 3. At this point it's pretty much game over. If you dont quest successfuly on the first round your fate will come sooner. Not only do you have to be able to quest well, you are also going to need to be able to defend high attack enemies that have decent defense and a hefty amount of HP. Also, the unpredictable revealing of Mugash from the out of play deck with engagment of 1 and big time stats will destroy even a good start.

This is one of the more difficult quests I have seen in a while, Maybe I have not thrown a lot of different decks at it yet, but I would put it on par with Morgul Vale.

More spoilers



I agree, Traker.  It is easily my favorite quest in the box and the one I have played the most.  In two-fisted, the locations pile up quickly and slow you down.  In a couple of games, the treachery that forces you to remove a time counter or damage all exhausted characters (and surges!) came up twice in one quest phase and caused me to choose between losing heroes and failing the quest or letting the timer run out and taking FOUR! more encounter cards.  Needless to say, I lost those games.  I think the search mechanic is great and adds a lot of unpredictability and replayability to the scenario.  When you add more players, you risk the chance of finding one of Mugash's guards, which are really nasty too.  Or, you can flip over Mugash and a guard in one turn, and you'd better be ready for it.  Just a great quest, a solid difficulty, interesting mechanics, and lots of strategic decisions that the player has to make. 

## 423 [Bullroarer Took on February 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=998255)

As long as we have started to talk about strategy...

 

The Timed mechanic does what it was designed to do: put early pressure on players not to dawdle.  The effect on my deck building - and this is especially true of "To Catch an Orc" - is that I now am running a lot of 3 of Uniques where I used to run two.  Examples are Asfaloth and Arwen.  Where I used to run only two of them figuring I would get one sooner or later, now I run three because I want them in my opening hand and in the case of the second quest, I don't want all the copies to be in the orc deck. 

 

Of course this means having even more cards in my hand that possibly might not do anything, so loot cards and conversion cards are also important.  By this I mean cards like Daeron's Runes and Protector of Lorien.  Throwing away useless cards to Eowyn's ability is obviously good too.

 

Great quests in my opinion and they have really got me streamlining my decks.  Cards that were "nice to haves" aren't making the cut in some cases now.

Man you guys are all breezing through these quests, I just got Vol yesterday and played the first quest last night.
Lost about 5 times and couldnt play anymore (was getting far too late and was also getting frustrated).
I did get to the third stage twice though and lost on the second stage the other times.
The time counters and whatnot aren't so bad its the enemies themselves..... for a quest that you need to be quick with and quest with lots of willpower to make any progress the enemies are quite difficult with their high armour, high health and even high attack as well........ even the goddamn trackers or scouts or whatever have 3 armour....

My decks are just too slow and get really strong over time not straight away and this quest more than almost any others (other than obvious ones like SAF, Morgul Vale etc) starts off pretty frantic and can easily overwhelm you within just a few turns.

I find the King's Road and Dunland Chieftain the worst of the lot.... If Kings Road comes out first turn and either deck has 5 cards in hand and you have to travel there instead of The Islet you can be in for an early struggle to get Grima and move to the next quest before running out of time especially if you cant clear the staging area.
I've edited both decks (play double handed) specifically for the quest however and am going to give it another shot tonight.
I'm fairly confident with my deck tweaking and hope/expect to beat it tonight! Hopefully the first time! Probably not though....

Definitely not breezing through them.  I have lost quite a few games too (except on the third quest).  I am lucky enough to have the expansion come out on a week when I have more time to play than usual.  If you're still struggling, I posted two decks I made that are thematic but can still beat the quests.  They pump out a lot of willpower quickly and have enough combat power to take down enemies.  Just a suggestion for you: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/forum/250-strategy-and-deck-building/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/forum/250-strategy-and-deck-building/]

It's interesting, this may be the first expansion where I'm actually more excited about the quests than I am about the player cards. Usually I'm all about the player cards but these quests are just so good! I also like that, beside having to move quickly, they don't seem to force to you to make a really specific deck to beat them.

I think scenario 3 is pretty difficult for solo,  it must be easier with more players, since first reports made it seem really easy.  Those trees can really beat you down if your deck is not questing fast enough to make it through, two of them have some pretty nasty forced effects.  I like how their attacks and or damage they deal are out of the combat phase, which really changes up some strategy.  I don't mind the one that raises threat, it's the other 2 to watch out for.   Very cool quest with a very different feel to what were used to.

Hey Tracker1, when the Huron enemies attack, have you been giving them a shadow card? I read in the rule insert that they do not get shadow cards nor attack during the combat phase, but when they attack outside the combat phase, are you supposed to give them shadow cards?? If so, what if Mugash has been shuffled into the encounter deck as a result of timing out and then he is dealt as a shadow card, does he go automatically to the staging area, or are you out of luck and have to wait until the encounter deck gets re-shuffled? I wish it was more clear on the cards, but I thought I would ask you since you have some experience playing the quest. Thanks!

Wow.  Night meet day.  I went back to my base build* which is built for the long game and then deliberately stalled the first four turns to build up my hand and resources.  Mugash went back into the encounter deck and then I went after him when I was ready.  Edge of Fangorn stayed in the staging area the entire game and while it did take a long time, the quest was never really in doubt.  By the time I found Mugash I had all my attachments and allies in play and it was trivial to quest out in one turn.

 

*I did add Shadow of the Past in case Mugash came out as a Shadow card.

Yup. Ran it again the same way. Took* a very long time as Mugash came down as a Shadow and I didn't have Shadow of the Past in hand, but I felt in control the whole way. So the third quest may be the easiest of the three after all, especially if you don't play for points. There's just something missing here as basically you can attack the trees, but they can't attack back. Also, ONI stage three when you reveal five cards and choose one a lot of the cards are a complete whiff since you aren't in the questing phase anymore.

Still, the first two quests are good right?

A duel it is narsil!

I changed up my decks again quite heavily and managed to beat the first and third quests a few times each. Tried a few other older quests with the new decks as well and had much better wins then before. Needless to say this made me very happy indeed ^^! Still trying with the second quest however... I almost aways cop take cover and hunting orcs surging together in the one turn =( very nasty. I'm surviving alot longer though.

I can finally read this thread now that I've finished all three quests. Spoilers ahead!

 

 

We played 2-player.  The first and second quests were moderately challenging.  The first was very "standard" for recent quests, it's just a flood of enemies, and if you can take control of the staging area you've pretty much got it made.  We beat it with a Bard/Yew Bow deck paired with a Dunhere deck at 22 threat each for a staging area attack strategy.  

 

The second quest gave us the most trouble.  We always play blind the first time, so we went in with our Bard/Dunhere decks and got choked by locations.  Went back to the drawing board, put together a tried and true pair of questing decks and the same thing happened.  That time we were just breaking even during questing, which is enough to ensure you lose the game by round 3.  Then we just went overkill by throwing in Eowyn and Glorfindel (replacing Frodo first, then Bilbo).  Once we got a couple of cards down and survived the first two rounds, the rest was very easy.  Mugash was waaaay at the bottom of my out-of-play deck, but we never felt threatened, it just took a long time to find him.

 

The third quest we won playing blind on our first attempt.  First round travel to Edge of Fangorn, second round clear it and claim Mugash.  Third round finished the first stage and went on to stage 2, then quest to victory on round 4.  Those Huorns were certainly ominous and menacing, but the time bomb never went off and we won very quickly.

 

Fun quests, To Catch and Orc definitely was my favorite despite early frustration.  But it did harken back to the days of old -- once you get set up, you can really own the board.  It just gets the most points for uniqueness.  The third quest looks like it has potential: when things go wrong, I think they probably go pretty wrong.  It didn't happen to us, so I'm not sure... was very easy on the first attempt.

We played that if you quest successfully, you increase the time counter regardless of whether tokens were going to be placed on the quest card.  It definitely made a difference-- I think there was a moment in the early game when we would have had the counter time out.  Once we got set up, though, we owned the board and the counter was a non-issue as long as we could deal with When Revealed or engage effects that give you the choice to decrease it or do something else nasty.

the encounter set could be used for other quests in the cycle and (i don't have my cards handy to reference) but there is a treachery that makes the trees attack - i just can't recall if they get shadows based on the treachery.

The rules say "When engaged with a player, an enemy with the Hinder keyword is not dealt a shadow card and does not make an attack during the combat phase".

 

I think this is ambiguous:

 

- it could mean that they aren't dealt shadow cards full stop - as rborkowitz said

- but it could mean [this is how I played it] that they aren't dealt shadow cards in the COMBAT phase, but that you would deal them at other times (when the Huorns attack because of treachery, or at the start of the resource phase for the Angry Huorn)

 

Actually, on reflection, not ambiguous: it's pretty clear that they will get shadow cards when they attack at other times.

As I said in the rules thread, it IS beatable the harder way - I've done it.

 

And it's clear from the answer I got from Caleb that the "harder" ruling was intentionally designed that way - it wasn't a mistake or an oversight on their part.

> > Does anybody know why there are shadow effects on some of the cards in the Into Fangorn quest?  Since all the enemies have Hinder and the rules say an enemy with Hinder is not dealt a shadow card, I can't think of any reason why shadow effect text should be included on any of the cards.  Am I missing somethere here?

Shadow cards would be dealt for the treachery card, there is also one tree that does attack during resource phase, so it would also get a shadow card then.

Speaking from a solo standpoint only, I found that the quest was really hard if I tried to keep Mugash from escaping into Fangorn.  This meant travelling to the Edge of Fangorn and adding a Huorn to the staging area.  This caused extra pressure early.  Playing the quest contrarian and just letting him escape and then tracking him down later made it much easier.

agreed; they have established the word "CANNOT" is absolute. So if they are choosing NOT to use "cannot," then they have deliberately left open the ability for huorns to get shadow cards.

yeah we've already both posted in that other thread about how we disagree, no need to get into it again dude.....

nothing you say is going to change how badly worded or ambiguous that quest card/mechanic is.

Also I haven't in any way tried to state or imply that it was a mistake or oversight, its just worded terribly and could be much much clearer.

This is kind of like not picking up the scroll in "Peril in Pelargir".  I don't think the designers intended the game to be played this way as it makes the quest a whole lot easier. I'd be curious to hear from them as to if this is true.

Indeed, that's been my question as well, regarding Saruman's whole corruption. It wouldn't quite jive with the text, as Saruman's treachery is revealed for the first time by Gandalf at the Council of Elrond. My hunch is that the heroes will have some vague suspicions or feeling that something isn't quite right, but nothing certain will be revealed.

My guess would be that the conclusion of the ring-maker cycle will be that the heroes have been helping Saruman in the making of his magic ring, thus the name of the cycle and, more importantly, the name of the last pack, which I will not say here (it was removed for a reason).

Finally got my hands on this the other day. Played the first quest only. Three times, yet to beat it. Think it is already one of my top five! Cannot wait to try the others once I beat it.

## 460 [Pharmboys2013 on March 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89341-voice-of-isengard-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=1007307)

A little late to the discussion party but wanted to throw in my two cents none the less...

 

Played through all the scenarios several times (solo only) with both a Rohan deck (with what seems like a currently popular hero line up of Eowyn, Eomer, and Prince Imrahil) and a Mono-lore "doomed" deck (Naturally running Grima and Loragon as well as Bifur).

 

I agree with the general consensus that "the fords of isen" and "to catch an orc" are the two harder of the scenarioes, but maybe I'm just lucky but i've been quite successful in the second quest compared to others.  Mugash has always been towards the end of my set aside deck so I've been well prepared to face him.  My only losses in the scenario were from bad first or second turn encounter draws which really has the potential to happen with any quest.  I can def see where not making progress on the first round can lead to an early death as well from the time mechanic, but I've been ok with that.  Probably my favorite out of the 3 just because I enjoy how unique the experience is.

 

Into Fangorn is a quick interesting quest.  I feel like I'm so intimidated by the huorns and their crazy stats, but rushing through quickly with will power is an easy solution.  Out of I think 4 play attempts on it I have yet to "reach" stage 3.

 

Fords of Isen is a challenging scenario, the dunland enemies all have decently high atk values and hp and they combo so well with the scenario itself.  The time effect on 2B can be really deadly as well if you either dont have an adequate number of characters out, or too many cards in the hand.  I wont be looking forward to battle these guys again going forward even though its obviously going to happen since all the enemies come from encounter sets that are not unique to the scenario itself.

Played "to catch an orc" multiplayer finally today.  Attempted 3 times and lost each time.  I think this one definitely scales up with more people mainly because of the locations so easily compound and combo with each other, didnt have a problem with enemies at all but anytime more than one Mehedres dropped on the board or an "orc territory" treachery was revealed it was normally too difficult to overcome

You'll get there dude, took me like a billion attempts but now I can beat it at least once out of every three attempts and the deck used can take on almost all other quests (at least all the ones I play; havent attempted any nightmare decks or print on demands but have played almost all other quests). To Catch An Orc, along with Morgul Vale and Shadow and Flame, has definitely been one of the most challenging quests to date and really pushed me to make two killer decks (I play two-handed) to beat it, the best part is though how good those decks are in general now =D

Pl ayed the fords of isen last night with my wife. Heroes where Theoden, Eomer, Hama for me, Eowyn, Dunhere, Theodred for her. All our carachters where either rohan or istari!

Looking all the way back to the beginning of this thread when everyone was trying to guess who was in the banner:

 

Whoever was originally on the left, they probably took him down because the card that he was on got removed (or was never actually planned to be part of the set in the first place).

 

I'm also sad to see that the picture that was likely Arwen is from a quest stage card, though that does help explain why the other characters behind her (behind the Ring) seemed to fit perfectly into one picture...

 

Anyone else sad about how this turned out?

Glaurung: "I don't like 1st quest."

I don't know. I played it solo with thematic Rohan deck. I didn't check any cards before playing so I lost once and then won. They are all too easy to kill and have weak threat. Dunhere is awesome against them all and if something goes wrong there is always killer Éomer. They need some Surge, lower engagement cost and higher defense.

But the artwork is absolutely amazing and the new mechanics, too.

But if you won't like 2nd quest, then something is wrong. Either with me, or with you, or with the quest. It has awesome storyline, mechanics, artworks and boss. Maybe it is not hard enough but I like it, cos you don't have to quest with Beorn, Eowyn, Sam and dwarf allies.

No, if he lost he would be raving about how cool the quest is.

 

This box isn't that hard, so I wouldn't expect to be hearing its praises sung by the power gamers among us.  Also, you do have to admit that the first quest is pretty "vanilla."  Fight and quest, very straightfoward.  "Time" is cool but doesn't bend the typical game experience any in the first quest -- when time expires, you just take damage, get more enemies, or lose the game.  So it just adds pressure but not a unique flavor... this is a flavor that's been around for awhile.  So I can see where he's coming from.

Od course i won both times…without even pay attention……Time is sounds cool but it never trigger in my game since i just blow up all this Dunldands….. waiting for battle and…..win in 5 min….. What  a Grima doing theret?  It sounds like: wow let put Grima there. For what? I don't know nut fans will be happy. AAA ok.  Some one get his salary for nothing…….

 What about draw card mechanic…. there is no cards with surge so is already…..Quest is really nothing…..

 

i play this game 3 years and i don't need kind of core set quiets difficulty 1 or 2…….. NM we need in the box straight away….

 

 I don't try second quest but i see cards and i like it….sure this one should be ok

I was thinking about this even before I read your post.  I think Deluxe Expansions are always a jumping-on point for new players.  They get displayed in store windows, they get more press, whatever... they get the game's presence out there more visibly, and they attract new people.

 

It's unreasonable to expect that no new players will buy the box, or that only 3-year veterans will pick it up.  New players will also come, and should -- this is good for the life of the game.  So they make quests that are accessible to everyone.   Heirs was a misstep in that department, and I bet we had some new players who outright quit after picking up HoN.  Lost business and lost community.

 

I don't mind a bit of a standard quest in a deluxe box as long as we get some flavor from the rest of it.  They need to keep the long-term player base happy as well, too, And we did, in this box.  I'll tell you right now though, none of these quests are hard enough to satisfy your glut for punishment!  So if challenge is the only thing that excites you about playing cards, you're going to be disappointed.

I think the quests are about right. But the third should have been the first. In other words the third quest should have been the most difficult. Not the easiest quest in the whole game... Glaurung don't even bother playing the third, u will be very very upset!

Hey, the first quest in one of the best they ever designed. I played it over a week before starting with the second one.

 

To catch an Orc is OTOH is boring. The mechanic sounds cool, but in all my games so far I either was brutally beaten because Mugash entered play too early, or they were a walk in the park because he came too late. There never was a challenge.

 

The Dunlandings are a gang of well designed enemies. I love love LOVE how they punish card drawing decks. And they're high threat enemies so you're able to play Hobbit and secrecy decks. The locations also make me sweat, and the treacheries are hard, but not unfair.

 

The story is ok, but I don't like that the heroes basically do all the work for the evil guys. Last cycle we supported Mordor, this time we help Saruman building up his evil might. That's deeply unmotivating for me.

I think the focus of the game is not only around the dificult level. I like the new original quests, 1s quest try to discard hand, 2nd quest try to find out Mugash and capture him, 3rd quest try to avoid huorns.... If you want dificult, play nightmare, if you want combat play HoN, if you want .... game not only is about thinking how is the next dificult step, i think is more about how original is the new way.

Yes i stop buy Lotr for now……I will buy now only Nmode…..

there is no point for me play a game which one you win for sure……….. I don't talk about difficulty but after Briliant HON and Ndecks for First cycle is a insult for me…… for what i pay my money……….????!!!!! I will not buy anymore until NM come. 

 

Hobbit NN and lst 3 NM quest that what is interesting for me.   And if majority of players happy with VOI so i happy for you.  But for me is child play in kinder garden….I create a deck which can play quickly 20 cards of my deck and encounter deck answer location 2 2 and maybe if you move there something happen…come enemy attack 2 and remove 1 tokens…… 

i like to use my brain not to sleep when i play cards………

The game is not only how easy you can win.

 

In fact, for new players these quests are really hard. For advanced players, are normal dificiults (in adittion, you must build special decks, for example, to play 1st quest specially).

 

But advanced players like to try the quests with diferent decks. The most boring in this game is to get one deck and try to win all quests with the same deck, and in adittion, to say: this quest is harder, this quest is easier... How? Can you say it only with this one little approach?

I beat all these scenarios straight away first time with caldera deck. I was a little disapointed at the time, but figured that power decks are not really the way to enjoy this game, except on the most difficult of scenarios. Building theme decks that fit to the story line seems to be the way the developers are designing the game. If your going to play your Mono-leadership Dwarf deck, sure you are going to be dissapointed, and if power decks are all you want to play, then like you say, just play NM mode, since my hunch is that the new scenarios, with there heavy emphasis on theme are also going to be designed to accomidate playeres who want theme to matter in their games. So yes, scenarios may be more casual, and this will probably satisfy the large majority of players who lean in that direction, the minority of players who enjoy very difficult quests where they must use the best decks around are going to be dissapointed.

Personally, I can adapt my play style to either direction, since i enjoy making decks that are intersting, even if they are not very poweful on the toughtest challenge. When a tough challenge arrives, i'll build a deck to take it on. For me getting the most out of this game is related to the deck building and ustilizing the variety of strategies that can be created with the player cards. If i just settled on a few power decks that can crush most scenarios then the game is boring and i lose interest fast. If every scenario is super difficult then each deck will probably be relying on a similar set of power cards that everyone plays, and the majority of player cards are worthless.

The only solution I am finding to this problem is to make and test a variety of different decks with different strategies to get the most out of a scenario.

Also the ultimate challenge already exists, have you beaten NM Dol Guldur solo yet? That should keep you busy for awhile. If every scenario was that difficult the game would also be boring, and more players would stop playing for that reason then if the scenarios are to easy.

yes sure I agree with you. But as I say w need NM right in the box.

I like ti build up different decks but I do not like to build up simple decks. For example your decks I can call decks. Decks what build up players who host cboftr is not decks is just a packs if cards. Play on your level im happy in them level just a waist of time...... so for me is clean Nmode!!!!! But I need to wair for that long time..... anyway I dont wonna insult anyone im just s straight

Glaurung, I have a special nightmare mode for you! And you don't even have to pay!

It is very simple: Beat the 1st quest with poor old Bilbo, the lore hero. You must play solo- one handed.

Forced: If Bilbo leaves play, you lose the game.

Thanks for suggestion but I dont like limitations.... I like to use all cards build up powerful combo and waiting for powerful answer. Nmode us perfect solution but we need to wait for so long time for that......

as I say I will not buy any new lotr product until there will be no NM included. Or will just wait for NPack and then buy......

Guys, I'd like your opinion on Deep Knowledge. At first I considered it to be a very strong effect and determined to put two in my deck along with three Daeron's Runes. The more thought I'm giving it however, the less enthusiastic I get. Even at 0 cost, the drawback is quite significant; 2 threat raise just to net me one card (the second will be the one that will replace the DK I just played) doesn't seem too much of a bargain for me. I know that in combo decks where you want your key cards to come asap, hence digging your deck is golden, it's importance is evident, still the drawback is nothing to sneeze at.

 

And a more specific question, concerning the aforementioned event: in an Outlands deck with a Lore (Beravor), a Spirit and a Leadership hero, if you had to pick between two DK and two Stargazers, which one would your choice be? I'm asking you because, if I finally decide to include the event, the Noldor gals will be the ones to go. Nothing beats personal trial and error, sure, I'm interested in your opinion though.

 

All the above concern one-handed solo play.

How much threat reduction do you have in the outlands deck? If it's none to little I would stick with Stargazer, but if you have Glorfindel and Elrond's Counsel it might save you resources to play Deep knowledge.

Is it easy to get the Stargazers in play, or is your spirit hero usuing resources for other cards that makes it a challenge to get them in? If my deck is strong in card draw, and resources are being used fast, a card like stargazer unless it is critical to the deck, might just end up sitting in my hand, since it's not necessary to arrange the cards. If the deck is slow in draw, and I want to make sure I get the cards I need each round then she is a good fit.

Stargazer with Beravor can get you 2 cards you want each round. With DK and Beravor, you can pull in 4 new cards.

Outlands decks need to get up and running fast, and then they can handle most things and threat will usually not be an issue. I would suspect that DK fits an Outland build better than stargazer, which may take a few rounds to get into play, and by that point, if you have a good outlands deck, she will be uneccesary because by round 3 or 4 the deck could already be a powerhouse.

But, without knowing the rest of your deck composition and strategy it's tough to say what the best approach Is. Although any deck that is not playing Aragorn lore with doomed cards is taking a risk.

Having finally got the box this weekend, I've been running a couple of decks I have kicking around against the new scenarios (the decks are a quest quietly deck using Frodo, Pippin (lore) and Glorfindel (spirit) that aims to mix high willpower cheap allies with deck manipulation, and a deck using Eowyn, Dunhere and Hama to kill things in the staging area). I lost against both quests the first time out (usually to tactical errors), but then walked them second time out.

 

To Catch An Orc certainly seems to be quite luck based (Mugash came out very late in the game, and got Feinted and whacked), and I was a little sad to see Battle and Siege keywords go, BUT, it was nice to get a new expansion and not immediately have to go build decks just to beat it! I'm excited about how secrecy is becoming viable again, since so few enemies engage at a low-threat, I actually got to play a sneaky deck, and the up-coming cards to help this trait will be mighty welcome.

 

That said, I can totally see power-decks eating these scenarios. Without the keyword changes, willpower is back as king.

I pay all VOi scenario with 3 players and is getting much better that way. IN solo game time mechanic almost never triggered 

but in 3 players game is start to work since questing is not so easy as in solo game. First quest a really brutal and card draw mechanic is doing good… ouch Dunlands is really dangerous!

 

Second quest also ok. Third is start to shine. I really love this one! Shame in solo encounter deck combo and time mechanic almost useless every game….

I'm glad you're enjoying it more. That's one of the reasons why I tend to prefer playing two-handed solo or 3/4 player games with others, as it gives a chance for the encounter deck to build its own combos/synergy.

 

I also agree with what monkeyrama said, I'm sad to see battle/siege go. I don't think they should appear in every quest, but I was kind of hoping those keywords would stick around rather than be limited to one cycle (and a few saga quests), as they really turned deck building on its head.

I'd like to see more conditional use of these keywords.  Stuff like "If this is the active location, the current quest gains Siege."  We have seen these sorts of effects before, I would just love to see them more frequently.  Forces you to make strategic decisions (like avoiding location X at all costs -- or rushing to travel there as soon as you can) without forcing you to use a certain kind of deck to finish the quest.  Siege and Battle, when printed on a quest card, eliminate too many possible deck types otherwise.

Absolutely. Much as I love Peril in Pelargir, it is a little annoying that some heroes that only offer willpower (obviously Eowyn, but even Sam to a certain extent) are almost useless until the third stage. I thought Blood of Gondor was good with the locations that controlled the type of keyword, and would really like that in future. 

 

Also, I agree with Glaurung 100% about the encounter decks getting better with more players. I mostly play two handed, and have found the Fangorn quest to be really quite tricky (although with no deck tweaking to help out - I still had traps in one deck...), and this is largely because the cards can stack against you very quickly. I can see Fangorn being much easier in pure solo (only one card out at the start etc.). A good start to the cycle though! Maybe with the return of Secrecy etc. in the coming packs we'll also see a mix of quest mechanics too.

Finally played, won and experimented with each quest solo one-handed (I know you all forgot about this box yet, but here in eastern europe it takes longer to get the newest expansion) and I must say I am not disappointed.

There are many things I like about VoI- smaller or bigger: Encounter cards are awesome, they bring theme, new interesting mechanics and art is just perfect(Down from the hills, Fords of Isen etc.). Every quest is absolutely unique and fun to play. Not a single card in the box is used in 2 or more quests from the box, so every quest is ready to be played. Encounter sets are smaller so you should meet most of the cards and see its uniqueness.

VoI has 2 heroes and everyone must like at least one of them. Either Éomer-classic hero in shining armor ready to smash orcs- or Gríma- unexpected hero with unique mechanic. Player cards have awesome art, some of them are very useful and/or interesting. Spirit had the worst cards in last cycle IMO, so I like that in this set it has the best (IMO).

And the fact that this box is required to play The Ring-Maker that promises good looking quests, Silvans, Eagles, Secrecy and Gondor player makes it a must have!

I played Fangorn 4-player. Got 2 forest malice or something like that. They put 4 huorns engaged with players and make them attack immidietely, then combat phase, and resource phase with huorns abilities triggering... And it can't even be cancelled.

If I am not wrong, if you add huorns into play because of this treachery, they won't attack. But maybe I'm wrong.

Yeah, but I drew this treachery two times in single quest phase.

Just played Fangorn 2P and 3P.  Def not a dud like it can be in Solo sometimes.  But it seems like its either a quick(but need a TON of WP) victory, or a ridiculous loss.  In 3P game we had like 9-10 Huorns in play by turn 3.  Enjoyed the quest though.

 I need to try Fangorn solo to see what it's like, but even 2 player it can throw some nasty encounter combinations at you (koriakin97's example is a good one). I think it may be the quest that I find most interesting to take on 2 handed.

In solo is ptetty easy.....it can be challenging if you let Mugash run into the forest and there will be long way to find him.... but with me is happen only once in 6 8 games....

In my opinion Into Fangorn is the hardest quest in the box.

I notice that, or you run like counsil Gandalf 'run you fools', or you sure loss. Mmmmh, said as this way: if you dont win at 3rd round, you loss the game.

 

So it is a little boored to play an scenario questing all to win in 3 rounds.

To be honest VOI quests is not the best box in the game…….Nmode can change it…..but when…..?…..

If they follow their schedule, then we'll see Voice of Isengard nightmare set in about... 4 years, at best. And that's if they decide not to do Road Darkens before the Voice of Isengard nigthmare.

Oh, they will do two saga boxes at least before Voice nightmare. After seeing one set of the Nightmare I now know it may be the only product of the game I will not buy. I am also not very excited about print on demand but Massing at Osgiliath is excellent and Battle of Lake-town a great challenge.

Played the 1st quest last night with a buddy.

Really fun quest imo. Not hard, but fun.

The time mechaninc is ok, but what I really loved was the punishment for having cards in your hand.

Then there's a encounter card that goes to you hand and you can't get rid of it? Good stuff.

There's also new encounter cards that stick to the quest card. Also a fine new mechaninc.

And the Grima ally letting you draw cards is just poking you in the eye...

Normally you would SO want that... I liked it!

Just play Catch the Ork with my friend.. one lose one win…… very ok quest actually solo, 2 players and 3 players….

 

There is one question: What happen if player who has Mugash in his Out of the game deck i Eliminated? Game over for all players? Looks like yes since Mugash is unreachable…..

Also one more think about rules…i have a new Dwafs leadership mono deck and able to cycle Sneak attack with a tome of ( I forget)  the one who cost less for every leadership hero and bring back event from discard pile. So actually this combo is crazy powerful!  Able to play 3 Sneak attack with Gandlalf in a single round is really huge advantage! in the end of the game  when your deck is small i really crazy. 

 

Foe example i was Able play Gandlaf 3 times in a round to KIll Mugash ( twice 4 damage) and then quest and finish the game in  1 round…… Really crazy combo…...

Don't you think that the theoretical difficulty level (4) of "To Catch an Orc" is lower than it should be? At least playing solo...

Just remember with the Tomb of x and the other cards like, after you play the event you retrieved from the discard pile that card goes back to the bottom of your deck. So, if you have one sneak attack in hand and none in the discard pile along with 2 tomb. You will only be able to play sneak attack twice.

Your probably playing it correct, but I made this mistake my first few games trying out the Tomb, scroll and the others.

While with my wife we won the fords of isen on firs attempt, we have mo yet managed to beat this after 7 attempts .... We won massing at osgiliath and battle of lake town much easier ...

Ignore the difficulty ratings, especially if you are playing solo.

The difficulty for To Catch an Orc depends heavily on the deck you're playing. I first encountered it with my tactics/spirit Rohan deck and won almost every game easily  - the only exceptions being when Mugash was revealed after turn 1 or 2.

 

I'm now playing TCaO with a lore/leadership Rohan/Loragorn deck. The scenario is much more challenging (and fun) to play. Despite losing more often I enjoy all the synergies between Grima, Isengard Messenger and Saruman.

I just finished the three quests in the box with my Beravor / Glorfindel (FoS) / Hirluin deck. Played thrice the first one (one loss and then two victories - in the second victorious game, I switched Beravor with Elrond and found it works a little better), twice the second one (a defeat and then a victory) and the third (two victories). Concerning the second one, which most people (and I concur) seem to consider the most difficult one, it's crucial to quest successfully and place a progress token --> add a time counter on the quest card in the first turn. That third counter makes a world of difference between failure and success. Other than that, it's certainly luck based; if Mugash is revealed early on, things will be worse than tough. I found the most important Outlands ally vs these quests not to be the Herdsman (as was the case in the HoN), but the Swordsman. The more the better. Fun quests, to be sure.

Who's your third hero? I came to Sam being the best partner to create The Doom Deck.  And at this point it kind of feels like there's really only one way of doing this deck which makes it kind of boring...

Same here. I really like idea if Hourn but most of the time is very easy to past it and win in maximum 3 rounds. But if Mugash will run to the forest (is happen with me once) then the game getting brutal…….. You need to find him, go deep and deep in the the Fangorn and things getting really grim.

If you LET Mugash run into Fangorn and don't try to catch him it is actually pretty easy. But if you try to catch him and fail then it's a problem.

It's Sam, lol.

Buuuut that's mainly because of the scenario's structure. Like it has been said already, if you don't quest successfully, you're toast. However,  I plan to try out a mono lore deck with Mirlonde or Pippin in the future. Or I'm going to change my current Hobbit deck (Spirit Pippin / Frodo / Merry) by switching Merry with Grima.
