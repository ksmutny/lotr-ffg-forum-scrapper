The boon cards earned at the start of RGS, Andúril, Sting etc. What happens to them during the setup of future scenarios? 

The Campaign card instructs us to choose 1 card (each player) and then shuffle the rest into the first players deck? Will this be the case for all scenarios that follow? Because they don't contain the permanent keyword does that mean that they get shuffled into our decks each quest after RGS? I'm a bit confused tbh.

You've earned them, so you can choose to include them, or not, in your player decks.  Doesn't have to be the first player.  Like the treasures of the Hobbit quests, you shuffle them into your deck like any other attachment.  But they cannot contribute to the 50-card minimum for a "tournament legal" deck.

okay thanks! that's a bit disappointing, since in a 50+ card deck it can take ages to draw those cards :/

 

Anyways we've been playing RD and a couple of things came up.

 

Concerning Andúril. I attached Andúril to Aragorn, now can other attackers join in on Aragorns attack when he uses the effect on Andúril to target the attacking enemy? Can Legolas for example join him in his Andúril attack?

 

Also if Aragorn uses the effect on Andúril to attack an enemy after having defended it, i can't attack the enemy again when declaring attackers regularly later can i? I know each enemy can only be attacked once each round but i was wondering if Andúril wasn't considered as a normal attack, like Hands upon the bow or Hail of stones or something.

No, Anduril's attack will be like Quick Strike -- other characters can't join in.  Normally you declare all attackers simultaneously.  With Quick Strike or Anduril you declare the attacker as part of the card text, and there's no opportunity to declare additional attackers.

 

You CAN, however, use Anduril (or Quick Strike, or Hands Upon the Bow) to get multiple attacks against a single enemy within the same round.  That one surprised me as well.

This might be a dumb question, but can I used Anduril's ability even when the attached Hero is exhausted? Or do I have to have some way to ready the hero after defending in order to be able to attack?

The attack is declared as part of the text on Anduril so Aragorn does not have to be ready. It is that same text which makes this an extraordinary attack and enables you to attack the same enemy multiple times, as the attack is not part of the regular framework of the round

Can i use Anduril's Attack against an enemy who is immune to player card effects?

For me, it's not the same as quick strike or hands upon a bow, because the enemy is directly targeted by Anduril itself.

..."target the enemy that just attacked."  I'm sure they did that on purpose: you can't use any "targeted" effects against immune enemies.

 

From the FAQ:

"This means that any player card that uses a form of the words “target” or “choose” cannot choose a card that is immune to player card effects as its target."

 

So I wouldn't use Anduril against immune enemies.

Anduril is boss on Elrohir. Plus +1 defense for all his defensive duties. Then you use his built in ability to ready after each enemy attack. Use Andurils ability to attack an enemy with 3 attack strength after resolving its attack (fantastic to weaken or outright kill weaker foes) and he will remain ready so long as you used his built in ability as Andurils ability exhausts only the weapon and not the attached hero. You can then swing again for 3 with him and even against the same enemy you attacked with Andurils ability if need be. 

Plus he can quest for 3 if you have a way for him to do this without exhausting or if you can ready him afterwards (naith guide, unexpected courage, lembas etc). 

Pretty beasty and also not as unthematic as many other choices for the sword. He is merely keeping it safe for Aragorn being his future brother in law and everything  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
