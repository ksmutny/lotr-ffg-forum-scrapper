Let's say I have To the sea ! To the sea ! attached to a hero, I have one spirit resource and I have 4 cards in hand, including ally Glorfindel (now, you probably see where I'm going wth this...).

 

My question is : can I discard the 4 cards I have in hand to 

 

reduce the cost of the next Noldor ally played this phase by X (to a minimum of 1)

 

like it says on To the sea ! To the sea ! and then play Glorfindel from my discard pile?  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

I don't see a reason why not.

I believe that is legal.

So Glorfi ally is like Keenes of lances, he reduces it's own cost by leaving your hand. What a dude!

 

Also one of the rareunique  allies that you can keep 3 copies of.

Has there been a formal ruling that Keen as Lances reduces its own cost?  The first Keen as Lances you play should definitely cost 5, not 4.  In order to add it to the victory display, you have to use its action.  To use its action, you must first pay for the card which is 5 for the first one you play.

 

Obviously Keen as Lances #2 is reduced by #1.

Yeah, I should have pointed that after the first Keen is played, it reduces it's cost.  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]
