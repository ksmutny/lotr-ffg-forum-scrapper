Hey I'm new and i have some Q's, 

1. Can you put progress tokens on a location while in the staging area or does it have to be traveled to first?

2. Do you really have to exaust a character just to travel to a location and make it able to quest on or am i missing something? 

3. Can Snowbourn Scout place its 1 progress token on a (on its ablity) on a location in the staging area or does it have to be traveled to?

4. I have Core set, KD and RTR.  What do you suggest i get next? The Mirkwood Cycle? The Dwarrowdelf or the Hobbit ones? Kinda looking for the ones that would get me the best cards thus would make it easier.  But also looking for one that has fun quests that are beatable.

 

Thanks

1. putting progress on a location in the usual sense…ie. by questing, means you have to have travelled to it. however other actions such as snowbourne scout can put progress on them in the staging area

2. you dont have to exhaust anyone to travel unless the location specifically says so (which usually is not the case)

3. as above…..either

4. dont go hobbit yet….it wil be too hard with your card pool…same goes for hiers of numenor.

just go to mirkwood and play them through in order, that way you experience the storyline.
