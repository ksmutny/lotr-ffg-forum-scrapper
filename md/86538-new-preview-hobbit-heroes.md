Ok, so when I first saw them, I was a bit shocked. I guess they all look fine except for Sam who looks hilarious, and then I was shocked at the spheres they chose for each of them. Sam in Leadership? that's, well, an interesting choice. Since Caleb said he based the hobbits off of the lotr as  a whole and not only from the beggining of fotr (Sam as mayor of the shire, Merry stabbing the Witch King, etc) I guess these will be the only versions of these heroes that we're going to see. If that's the case, I guess I'm fine with that.

And what's even more strange: the hobbit deck that this article proposes (Frodo, Merry, Sam and Pippin) has absolutely NO Spirit in it! What!? How are you supposed to play Smoke-rings and whatnot?

Which is... not included in this pack? They could have as well not included Pippin since we already got a decent (and spirit) version of him in the last AP. And also, I'm concerned about how a four sphere hobbit deck would work, IF it would work. Call me a skeptic, but that seems strange and off-putting.

Dude, again, I'm not saying it's not possible. I'm saying it's impractical. Extremely impractical. A four sphere deck (five, including ring-bearer sphere) which depends on songs which are extremely hard to get if you're a new player feels like a very odd choice from a design standpoint.

ok....first things first- i challenge anyone to say that merry doesnt look like his film version- he is the DOUBLE of dominic monaghan

 

 

so with that out of the way, onto the cards.

 

SAM. - i dont mind the art. its not amazing, but i dont see it as stupid either. Calebs idea of leadership is something that i wouldnt go to personally, sams leadership traits certainly do not overpower his spirit as a character, but thats ok, it makes sense in a way

 

MERRY - tactics was thought up from the start so im not surprised there. ive already mentioned the art

 

PIPPIN - i disagree with the sphere choice here. i do not consider the case good enough to put pip as lore. a similar case could be made for merry who led the 4 hobbits through the old forest- he was afterall a brandybuck who knew more about that area even than frodo. personally i would have made him spirit (which we already have hence i would have left him out)

love the art though, and despite thinking he looked like astin from the banner spoiler its much better up close

 

now, i am dissapointed not to see fredegar bolger. i was sure we would see him. surely he will be an ally. personally like someone said above, i would rather have seen no pippin and used his old version (already calling it old, and i havnt even got him!!) and seen fatty

 

all that seems like im dissapointed with the cards....so to balance it out here's what i like

 

calebs idea of the hobbits getting stronger as they perform heroic acts is very thematic and something i hadnt really considered and as i have said before its great that the designers are considering theme and lore first

 

im really trying to think of more good things to say here, but for the time being i am going to reserve my main judgement until i have the pack as i really want this to be the best expansion yet as it is based on my favourite piece of tolkiens writings...which i am sure it will be

Well there is going to be a fourth hobbit hero in the expansion which was not spoiled yet. We can assume that hero will be Spirit (and Rich, he could be Fredegar).

 

I also was initially not too impressed with the Sam card art, but after looking at the higher res image, it doesn't look that bad. It looks like he's staring into the eyes of Shelob, almost consumed with fear, but not quite...

 

I second what Rich said about the sphere assignments. Everything can be made a case for except Pippin as Lore. They probably put themselves into a bind when committed to releasing a Spirit Pippin in AtS. I think Merry could make a better case for being Lore with the library he put together and his trips to Rivendell. Caleb could have said something about Pippin spending a lot of time in the libraries in Gondor after the War of the Ring.

good- i forgot about that, i assume they didnt mean the 4th hero was the frodo card?

ps - i just looked at the artisit for the cards and what is strange is that they were all done by the same artist. i wonder why he stayed clear of the film versions for sam and pippin but relied so heavily on merry? strange....

Yes looks like in Decipher previous game again. Very cool Sam without any problem deal with  Witch-King. Hate it!

Stupid, nasty hobbitses. I like more idea of hobbits just a sneak hide and run. Now we will see Merry Fighter like a  Aragorn.

Also a bit dissapointed.....

I also think the card abilities are pretty spot on.

## 14 [Samwise Gamgee on July 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816219)

Yes, in that sense, a 4 attack Merry seems pretty ridiculous. One thing that I guess tempers the Hobbits' abilities is the fact that they are in so many different spheres. If you have too many Hobbits, resource generation will be tough in the beginning. Another observation is that there will be no Hobbit monosphere decks ran in the Black Riders.

That's how I understood it. There will be four hobbit heroes in addition to the Frodo hero card.

I'm kinda sick of Villeneuve/Dainche art for my part. Especially on Hobbits. The card abilities however seem all nice. I guess this can be a functional deck but as I said before it will be tough with resource management.

## 18 [Pharmboys2013 on July 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816240)

wow, quite surprised at the negativity around the cards considering how much i love all of them.

 

the art is pretty good with clearly Pippin> Sam> Merry IMO

 

i really dont mind the sphere choices at all, we cant nitpick all day about the merrits of any one hobbit in any one sphere but they cant all be spirit or lore so i thought Caleb did a very fine job fitting the characters into spheres while still maintaining the essence of the game (4 heroes 4 spheres per saga expansion)

 

the powers are really great and i cannot wait to build a hobbit deck with these guys along with the other toys they'll get in the box.  anyone who has already tried to build a hobbit deck with the current cards surely already realizes how underpowered they are at the time so i dont mind Merry's potential 3 or 4 attack if it means i dont have to rely on the hobbit gandalf each turn to kill anything

 

i also love how well they synergize with each other as was already stated in the article, Pippin's ability is so unique and cool that it already makes his current incarnation seem obsolete (also whats up with Pippin just having the two best art depictions by far?! they must really love him)

I like that the Hobbits were made with the entire saga in mind (especially as Sam's art suggests, because I think he's threatening Gollum in Mordor), so that they have room to grow and improve.  When paired with the boons, these hobbits can become a strong deck archetype. But I wonder what the game designers will do about the breaking of the fellowship.  These hobbits were clearly meant to be played with other hobbits, but one of the strengths of the hobbits was how they inspired/worked with other races.  Will we get a Rohan Merry and a Gondor Pippin, or Ent boosting versions of those characters?  With lots of great heroes still to come in the saga expansions (Eomer!), I'm curious as to how the designers will approach it, and if we'll get more hobbit versions to the exclusion of other heroes.

One thing I was hoping was lower starting threat values so the secrecy decks could make a bit of comeback. 6 isn't bad, but a whopping 8 for Sam.

i think that, given the fact sauron was only interested in frodo and didnt even consider hobbits to be a threat at all, all hobbits apart from frodo (and bilbo) should have a threat of 6. sam perhaps can be given a higher threat if you are looking at the entire lotr, as he was a ring bearer for a short time

I actually like the Sam card very much. I think he too is very similar to the movie version. Which is cool by me. Haven't read the books yet you know ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] and that's maybe the reason I think he actually fits in the leadership sphere. Not that he is a leader like Aragon, but he does take a lot or responsibility, specially when Frodo gets stung by Sheelop and gets the ring before the orcs. This might not happen in that way in the book and if not I fully understand the hesitation about him not being spirit instead :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'm just happy to get him as he is my favorite in the whole tale.

no that is a good point. i guess it depends on how you see the words leadership, spirit etc. its interesting to see whether cards literally represent that phrases as described in the rulebook at the beginning

 

if you look at what it says under leadership then sam certainly does portray the initiative and inspiration to frodo.

if you look at what it says under spirit then it also looks like sam!

 

so i guess the designers have the choice of either there. to make things more complicated he could have been lore for his knowledge of the garden and even poems, and tactics for showing shelob where to go

 

i think sam is the toughest of all, thats why im not particularly dissapointed either way

the more i think about these hobbits the more excited i get about them! lots of good deck choices with them

 

obviously they all work great together (excited to see the spirit hobbit too who i would think is either bilbo or fatty) but even alone Sam and Pippin make great additions to decks.  Sam's ability doesnt have any other "hobbit" factors to it so throwing him in a deck with a reasonable starting threat you can have a great quester who can also attack or defend with 2! it helps even more that he's leadership which is a sphere that is very much lacking in characters with high starting will power and low starting threat, two things Sam excels in.  Pippin also is quite good in decks using lore, thinking about my current lore/spirit deck of Denethor, Mirlonde, and Glorfindel (spirit) i could replace Mirlonde with Pippin, have the same starting threat, quest for the same amount of points (both have 2) AND draw cards when i optionally engage with enemies

 

with all their low starting threats, a hobbit deck also makes ideal use out of ithilien pit as well... lots of options

why? we pay for these cards. im sorry but when you pay for a product you immediatly get a valid opinion...which includes you, so i respect your opinion not to complain...all sorts i suppose...but as far as im concerned what makes us human is our ability to form opinions, and that includes complaining...and thats coming from an englishman - and we never compain, just try serving a fly in our soup :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

just for the record i wasnt complaining about the cards design...i like to talk about the designs of cards, its interesting to consider how close they represent the real thing.

 

as for the art, thats a whole other story i wont derail the thread with, but it has to do with the books being books not films

I too wonder what the game designers will do about the breaking of the fellowship and the situations after that. These hobbits were clearly meant to be played with other hobbits, but ex Sam and Frodo was only two for a long time (maybe gollum will be a objective Hero or something that allows him to be counted as a Hobbit to for the count hobbit bonus). Also how will Merry be able to damage the Wtich king? He and Eowyn and maybe king Theodred, he will have 1 in attack!

Merry's response would still be really useful in reading an attacker, Théoden for example.

i trust in the game designers to make relevant scenarios after the breaking off the fellowship, they've been superb so far.  its literally their job to do this (even tho we talk about it like its our job  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ) so i trust their judgement

## 36 [kyrie on July 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816315)

All three new hobbits are great! I love the synergy of Merry and Pippin with other hobbits (best to use them in a mono-hobbit deck). Sam on the other hand, I really am looking forward to because not only it provides much needed leadership to the hobbit deck, but his ability works in any low-threat deck or even mono-leadership deck. I will definitely be trying him out in all sorts of decks, even if it's just to splash leadership to get steward of Gondor and Sneak attack. His questing power for 3 and low threat are perfect for any deck.

 

I may be overestimating a bit, but I think Sam might be the new "spirit Glorfindel" but of the leadership sphere. He's only 3 threat more, but has a positive effect rather than the negative threat gain, and the ability I foresee as going off quite a bit, so essentially he comes with a "Light of Valinor" pre-attached to him but boosts his attack and defense to a reasonable amount. I don't want to say he will be more powerful than Glorfindel, but maybe with all the hobbit attachments (like the cloak) he might just prove to be better (though I might be biased given that the leadership sphere is my personal favorite giving access to sneak attack and steward).

 

Does anyone else think Sam might prove to play on par or even higher than Glorfindel?

thats tough to say- i think, as you point out in your post, it depends on the cards we get specifically for him. one of the main reasons glorfindel is so powerful is the light and asfaloth

## 39 [Rapier1 on July 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816369)

My post just got destroyed (after I wrote it for an hour) so this is more of a summary:

 

I'm concerned that getting Pippin will mean we'll get new versions of other fellowship members (particularly Aragorn and Boromir). I don't feel that we "need" a new gimli or legolas either. 

 

I'm concerned about the overall power of these three heroes (although I do really like them at the same time), all three hobbits feel like they get two special abilities (that they don't pay for)

Merlonde gives +3 stats (effectively) as her only ability. Bifur has +1. The elf brothers each get +1 (but only together, separately they actually pay 1). Sam is basically the second best at this role (With only spirit glorfindal being better at +7 - but everyone seems to agree that he's overpowered, and probably the best single hero in the game).

 

Sam gets +3 stats if you engage something more threatening than you. He also gets a free ready. This means that Sam can quest for the same as Aragorn but doesn't have to spend a resource to ready, he can ready for free if he engages something above the threat cost. He gets to attack or defend at +2 as well as questing for 3. I think Sam is clearly the most powerful hero here (and much more powerful than other "8" cost heroes, except for Spirit Glorfindel)

 

Merry gets up to +3 stats (in a Saga expansion with a hobbit bonus hero) or more likely +2. He also gets the amazing ability to ready another combat hero. I feel that these two abilities together may be too good - although I do like that one of them is better with hobbits and the other is better without (since letting another hobbit attacker ready to attack again isn't that great). He has good potential as the combat star in a tri-hobbit deck, and as a support in mono-tactics to get for instance, double legolas questing, or Gimli with high damage twice. (Although I think merry might be a bit too good, I really like the design here).

 

Pippin has obvious synergy with hobbits. (Letting the hobbit theme of engaging high threat enemies work for longer, and on smaller enemies). I think his secondary card draw ability will rarely see play outside of the hobbit theme. Overall I find him quite underwhelming if not taken in the hobbit theme. It's especially a shame because spirit Pippin also only works with all hobbits - which means we now have two hobbit cards that absolutely need other hobbits, and they don't work together. (Merry I think will work even without other hobbits).

Overall I'm excited by the direction of the hobbit theme, but I fear that it's trying to ramp up too quickly to compete with the strong Dwarf theme - and that this could lead to power creep and inbalance with other themes. (See outlands). The smaller themes like hobbit and outlands will already have an advantage in being very focused because of their narrower card pool. Making them too good will sideline other bigger themes (even dwarfs if Hobbits continue to get power like what's shown here).

(Dwarfs are too strong as a theme mainly because they should have been broken up the way elves and men were - but since they weren't initially we're now stuck with that poor design choice - I hope it won't prove to be a problem for power creep and balance in general).

Sorry if it isn't clear - but I don't have time to write it all again.

Not much to add that hasn't been mentioned yet.  Artwork is decent.  Synergies are very nice for the Hobbits!

 

I did notice that Sam is really the only one that really doesn't have any built in hobbit-dependant abilities... making him a bit more versatile than the other two.  That combines with his better stats probably justifies the higher threat cost.

 

I honestly think the lack of a Spirit sphere amongst them is due to the previous Pippin having that sphere, regardless of who the 4th hero in the set will be.  This way, you can run with Sam, Merry, and either version of Pippin based on whether you prefer to run green cards or blue.

 

Personally, while the Pippin cards are OKAY if you want to create a theme deck, I am looking forward to a Sam, Merry, and Glorfindel (spirit) deck that starts below the Secrecy threshold.  That gives me the blue cards I need to cancel treachery/shadow, to stay under the secrecy level, and the allies for questing.  Sam can bring his secrecy cards to the party.  And Merry pulls in those potent Tactics cards to give them all some bite (Gondorian Shield on Sam to give him 3 defense after questing, potentially 5 with the cloak- for 2 resources total... Rivendell Blade on Glorfindel- combined with Merry's readying ability?  Potent..).  About the only thing lacking would be the encounter deck manipulation and healing from Lore... card draw can be managed with Foe-hammer, Gandalf, etc...

I like these hobbits versatility!

Great cards ! I couldn't think of a better way to develop hobbit heroes. They are very thematic also. Sam is one of my absolute favourite character and the part against shelob and the tower of Cirith Ungol is one of my fovourites, so I appreciate the art has that setting. I also like the spheres they're in. Sam literlly leads Frodo towards the completion of his task, merry is (with eowyn) the witch-king slayer and pippin is a Took ! The hard part will be choosing which hobbit to use and which one to let out ! And if Fatty is going to be the fourth that's going to be an even harder choice. I'm really looking forward to see what the tactics cards will be like. I also like that each one of these hobbits is perfectly playable in non-hobbit decks. Pippin will still increase enemy's threat cost by 1 and you'll still draw a card if you engage an enemy with a higher threat, plus with mirlonde he's great for monolore secrecy. Same for Merry, a tactics hero with 6 threat and 2 WP (3 with theoden)...pretty welcome...and he has a very cool and thematic ability. Sam is just awsome, he quests for 3 (for only 8 threat in the leadership sphere !) and stands in front of a tough enemy raising all of his stats by one (except for HP which by the way is just awsome and accurate since he's the sturdiest hobbit ever). Great heroes, can't wait to have TBR in my hands !

I also think they did a good job. Not exactly what I was expecting, but still very good. I REALLY hope that the last hero is Fatty, Farmer Maggot, or Rosie, and not Bilbo. I don't want Bilbo coming along on these adventures. He already has two sets of his own!

Very excited about this. Okay now at first glance they might seem overpowered (merry with 4 attack) but it think it´s compensated with the distribution of the hobbits in the 4 spheres. Managing 3 or even 4 spheres with hobbits might result a bit tricky and i really like this beacuse it will make you think more on the deck building aspect. Also note that Merry and Pippin have only 2 hitpoints and Sam 3 so if you don´t play carefully the journey to Rivendell might be a short one, especially with the 9 Black-Riders (which i hope we can face all together in the Ford).

Most of you seems to forget that these Saga expansions are "meant" to be playable with core set, but without anything else. So it was guite obvious that we would get Pippin, Sam and Merry, because they are not in the Core set. (I forget Frodo of cource allso, but he is the "new" extra hero, so there has to be new version of him allso).

We have Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Gandalf in the core set, so it is not nesessary to make new versions of them. It may be possible that we get them allso, but it is not nesessary. Boromir is must, because he is not in core set. Let see just when he will be released.

 

All in all I am guite happy what I have seen so far, and my Hobbit frency friend will be happy too! He will get his Hobbit deck at last! :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

On another note, after some thought, I believe they will eventually release a spirit version of Sam and Merry at some point through the APs.

I on the other hand think a new legolas and gimli will be a lock for the next box. I know they're already in the core, but they are such critical members of the fellowship I would be very surprised if they weren't included, besides I suppose we're about due for new versions of them. Boromir on the other hand is an interesting case, he obviously is also very important but it seems kind of odd that he could be our first 3rd version of a hero especially after getting one so soon (although pippin goes against this reasoning). What sphere would he even be? Another tactics?! An argument could be made for lore (albeit not a strong one) and spirit would be a real clash. Instead I may think that we would get an ally version (likely tactics). It has a precident with Gloin, Bifur, and Dwalin from the hobbit boxes so I doesn't seem it would be a huge reach.

Personally I think the heroes for the next box would be(rounding out the fellowship):

Aragorn (we can't NOT get another version of him in these expansions...it's gonna happen), Legolas, Gimli, then the last spot be occupied by any one of the following: Elrond, Haldir (my pipe dream), Celeborn, Galadriel, or Arwen (I'd think she's least likely since her book part is so small despite being an important character)

I got quite annoyed reading this. I'll be quick to say (for like a zillionth time) that this is my all time favourite game, and I am very grateful to have got it. However, these boards are for opinions about the product. I don't think they're meant with a slogan: PLEASE GLORIFY OUR EFFORTS OR REMAIN SILENT.

On a related note, do you visit internet much? Have you ever been to IMDB for instance? I only go there for reference but I have glanced over the boards a few times. Boy, do not go there if this annoys you, or you might be up for a heart attack. Because there are films that people put much, much more time and effort into (than ffg, hardly comparable even) and yet the majority of the boards show up only to troll. I think trolling is quite rare (if even existent) on these boards, for which I am quite glad. But I think people are entitled to dislike what they are offered, no matter how much work has been put into it. Of course, you can get annoyed by it, and of course you may share that feeling with others, but doing so seems quite naive to me.

Great call about Pippin. But I don't understand why we saw him at Amon Din. Shocking to get him twice within a few months.

I am not sure we will see another Boromir. I would like that because I am totally bias and he is my favourite character but it seems unlikely to get a third copy of him, or is it?

Who will be the fourth Hobbit? Fatty or Bilbo? I think we need a more active Bilbo even though it makes little sense. I feel what we got in Mirkwood cycle was an older Bilbo and now might get a younger one? Fatty as an ally perhaps? Barliman is. How about Barliman Butterbar, Farmer Maggot, Fatty Bolger and Folco Boffin as allies?

And to finally comment on the cards previewed. I really like them in general. I like the art for Merry, especially the surrounding. It seems very film-inspired, not only the facial features but the whole scene.

 

The fact none of these are Spirit has me hoping we shall see cards outside that sphere to counter treacheries or even lower threat (Lore has got that already). It is pure speculation but I would like that very much.

Yes, we definitely need more options to cancel treacheries. That's one of the main problems with building mono-sphere, is that you don't get access to key cards in other spheres. Hopefully we'll see more in the near future.

I love these three new Hobbits. Finally some low cost heroes to boost the secrecy keyword (at least a couple of supply cards would be nice, FFG; though there should be some to support the Hobbits, right?). Mirlonde/Pippin/Frodo should make an interesting deck.

 

As for the spheres, I am not as picky as others. I don't mind if a sphere doesn't fit completely. Sam seems to be ok, Merry too. And Pippin - well he is curious and likes to explore his "wisdom" ("What happens when I watch into that crystal ball?" - "Oh!"). He is clearly the Hobbit version of a scientist, so yeah, I think lore is a good choice for him.

I agree. I mean, just look at The Steward's Fear. In just one pack, Outlands became a viable deckbuilding option. They could easily just feel one adventure pack with all secrecy cards. Not that it would be enough, but it would definitely bolster secrecy's strength. I would be curious to know why they haven't given it more attention.

indeed, and not just for the playability, but the theme...i mean it is the ongoing theme throughout the fellowship as i say...thats 2 saga packs i would dedicate to secrecy.

 

how many of use actually play secrecy? i am at the moment as i have just built a great deck with a friend but apart from the line up we chose there isnt really any more choice than that....you are basically forced to use glorfindel. the hobbits will help of course but unless secrecy gets more options it is going to just fall out of memory...which is a shame as it is one of the best developments i think

To all of those saying we'll see new heor versions of Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, etc. Really? Why? This is supposed to be played with the core set, and there you have pretty decent versions of these characters. I don't see why would they make new versions of them. However, I'm pretty darn sure we'll see them as new ally cards, that's for sure.

 

On an unrelated note, while I like Merry and how he works with the hobbits, I don't see how he suposedly works with Rohan as some of you have said. In fact I don't think he works with them at all. Yeah, he's a low threat tactics hero to use with Theoden, but he's pretty much only good with other hobbit heroes, so I just don't see myself using him in a non-hobbit deck.

In my opinion designers see secrecy can be very unbalanced in the future and will ve more and more difficult keepna good balance with this mechanic.

Im pretty sure if spirit Glorifindel was a secrecy hero with text: if you control another 2 heroes discard Glorifindel from play then yes. But they was not really serious about it. And then caleb come and things start to change. Will be no secrecy.

I hope that you're right about that - I'd love to get some of them as allies. While I like the hero versions, being able to add some of these characters to decks where I use other heroes would be great.

They did similar things with the dwarf allies that had previously been heroes in the hobbit boxes, so its not unprecedented.

> On an unrelated note, while I like Merry and how he works with the hobbits, I don't see how he suposedly works with Rohan as some of you have said. In fact I don't think he works with them at all. Yeah, he's a low threat tactics hero to use with Theoden, but he's pretty much only good with other hobbit heroes, so I just don't see myself using him in a non-hobbit deck.

 

Merry will quest for three with Théoden. That's pretty good for 6 threat. Other tactics boosters and attachments could help him out.

Well, let's keep in mind that the 4-strength attack will ONLY be possible while using him for the saga quests.  In the "normal" core/expansion/AP quests, at best he would be able to get to 3 attack (with two other hobbit heros).

 

On top of that, so far much of the new hobbit "stuff" (abilities, events, etc) seems to be preventing conflict... such as the event that prevents all engaged enemies from attacking... the caveat to that card is that you also cannot attack the enemies in return... So I think his impressive attack abilities will be limited by a) regular encounters outside the sagas, b) some of the natural mechanics of playing other hobbits anyways. 

 

And they had to give you SOMETHING to be able to attack with if you don't get any of those hobbit "escape/evade" cards or abilities into play...  Right now, he seems to be the only option.

You also have to factor in the hit points for the hobbits. 2 points/hobbit (except Sam). That's quite the liability.

To those who don't anticipate that Aragorn, Legolas, or Gimli will be heroes in the next box but rather allies, I'm curious to hear who you think WILL be the heroes. I just can't get passed the idea that the one box which would contain quests where the whole fellowship was present, we wouldn't actually receive any heroes IN the fellowship (save Boromir who's complexities of inclusion as a hero I already discussed previously). Do you also not think we will receive another Eowyn throughout the duration of the expansions simply because she's in the core? With 6 expansions we will have 24 heroes released by the time things are said and done, I really don't think FFG is going to neuter their creative developments to cater to the small portion of players that will only have the core and an even smaller portion of those that would be offended by duplicate heroes.

Playing devils advocate tho, if the 3 Hunters are not included that to me leaves:

Elrond

Arwen

Haldir

Celeborn

Galadriel

Boromir

(None of which are perfect fits for tactics (save repeating Boromir) although the same was said of the hobbits prior to yesterday)

no i agree with you, i think we shall see both the hunters as allies and heros at some point, just like the dwarves of thorins company are

 

i think your list of who the heros are will depends greatly on how far ffg are willing to stretch the term 'hero'. there are of course plenty of characters, but whether the designers would use them for heroes or not i dont know....i sort of hope they do...i would rather like seeing lesser characters as heroes

I also think (and would like!) to see them as allies too but I think that'll be later IMO.

As for my "list", I like the more obscure characters as well but I listed the most logical in terms of their relevance in the book and how most of them haven't had hero cards yet

I still think that you're right that we'll have at least one of Legolas, Gimli, or Aragorn in the next one. You raise a good point, because I don't think any of the characters listed have the right "feel" for the next box. But, we won't necessarily have 24 new heroes released.

Merry looks like a very strong character to me. Untap effects are always strong. I expect him to sit very comfortably with either 2 other hobbits for 3attck , maybe 4. Still the real power is when playing with Brand. What you now have is a range attack system that can do so much.. It needs a add range card to run but this is not hard to get running and brand himself can function 1/2 the combo by himself.

 

Merry and Brand attack. Brand untaps target toon for your partner. Merry untaps Brand. Brand and Target Toon attack. Brand again untaps target toon again. So we are lookign at +5 attack minimum each attack from range + the attack value of what ever card you are untapping every time. Some thoughtful optional engagements can max the untap effect based on turn order, but in most cases the untap will be used for the NEXT attack. Still swarms of enemies can now be taken down with ease.

 

Also the sword deck can pull as much has they like and block, not needing to worry about attacking back as you can untap all the cards. This can be done nearly on trun 1 as well. Pretty powerful.

 

If you get some Elf Rope or w/e the **** it is called or UC on Merry this becomes a combo that can untap entire hero lines across the table. It isn't quite infinite but close.. though there are better uses for UC, the elf rope might find a good target in Merry.

 

Pretty keen to try it when I get a chance.

I don't think it is that tricky. The books were fairly delineated between Frodo and Sam, and the rest of the Fellowship. So in those Saga Expansions with Frodo and Sam, you have the ringbearer sphere. With the rest of the Saga Expansions, maybe (this could be farfetched, but hear me out) you have Aragorn replacing Frodo as that main hero. Just my theory. It could be way out there.

Crapamundo!  Why stop there?!  Put Brand and Merry on opposite sides of the table.

 

Brand and Merry attack the same target.  Merry readies Brand.  Brand readies Merry.  Rinse, lather, repeat until the table is clear of enemies, at least on Merry's side of the table.  Then you get at least one more attack on an enemy engaged at Brand's side of the table.  2, really (Brand's player declares attack, Brand readies Merry, Merry's player declares attack, Merry attacks alone).

Why all the sentiment that secrecy is dead?

 

I agree that 2 hero secrecy is very difficult to motivate but certainly not impossible if one of the hero's provides extra resources ala Theodred. 3 hero secrecy is very much alive and well and there are a large number of options here. If you're playing a deck that can provide strong threat reduction and you regularly find yourself below 20 threat, how could you not consider resourceful, even you don't play any other secrecy cards.

 

The secrecy card pool provides some of the strongest cards in the game imo. I would like to see it grow, but I do feel as though the current options support secrecy very well. 

 

The recent Hobbit Developer deck is very instructive in this regard and my playtests with the deck have been excellent. It's a really really strong mechanic as it stands imho.

Bombadil would have a very high power level whem compared to other heroes (if the devs make him true to the books), Goldberry as a hero would also he quite a stretch and Gildor will be unplayable in some quests, because he is an objective ally in this saga expansion so you would have to eat up threat cost for replacing heroes in campaign mode, should you want to include him.

Right, forgot about Gildor. Guess he is out. I don't think that Bpmbadil has to be that strong. He is very passive/uninterested, so he could be designed in a way that he has some low stats but a great passive ability. or an ability that is triggered when you play a song on Bombadil. Same goes for Goldberry (who could have some healing ability) who I don't think is a stretch. She is more powerful than most of the characters in LotR and she gets more page time than Hirluin. Let's not forget there is a certain lack of female heroes.

>  

I personally am most certainly not against duplicate Heroes.

 

I want more then anything a new Aragorn (spirit), Legolas and Gimli. Along with specific items, weapons for them (Anduril, Lothlorien gifts, etc.)

 

I know the existing versions of these characters are great, but they are my favourites and I want as many options to play them in different sphere combinations, synergies and circumstances as possible. I personally don't think it's likely, due to a lot of negative buzz concerning this topic in the past. I think we'll get ally or object ally versions of them instead. Like the Hobbit with Thorin's Company, the designers will want the single player to have the option of having the whole fellowship under their control.

 

I think this is a big shame. This is the real Lotr now, and I want up-to-date, definitive versions of it's most prominent characters. I think objecting to duplicate characters not only cuts down on the options available for playing with your favourite heroes, it hurts the longevity of the game. There are only a finite amount of characters, and while I very much appreciate seeing lesser characters as Heroes, eventually that is all we'll get. A second Pippin? Strange perhaps, but honestly how could he not be in the black riders set? The three hobbits previewed synergise fantastically together.

 

Having said all that, I think FFG will go the elven route with the second fellowship set. Galadriel, Celeborn, Arwen and Haldir. All new heroes, two new girls (much needed, as inevitably with some stunning art from Magali), and all giving a much needed boost to the much needed and requested Elven synergies. I would prefer this in a parallel Elven cycle, but I don't think it will happen.

 

The Three Hunters in the Treason of Isengard box? I would love it but I think it's unlikely. Rohan synergies and Ents are a certainty, I think.

 

As sad as it seems I think we may be stuck with the core set Legolas and Gimli (as Heroes at least) for some time.

 

Ps, whoever said the main objective ally after the breaking of the fellowship could be Aragorn, I think that would be an excellent idea. However, I think it more likely to be Gandalf the White (Fangorn onwards, of course). It wouldn't step on the toes of people who want to use the existing Aragorns, and would go part way to giving us an actual Gandalf hero. (A powerful Hero, and one they would never have to worry about breaking the rest of the game.)

I see the only sensible way in having Bombadil and/or Goldberry in game as a one-time use ally (think Escort from Edoras) or through an attachment or event. They weren't travelling through the Middle-Earth, so I see little sense in having them as a heroes in, say, Siege of Cair Andros, or in Moria. I know that the game stretches the believability sometimes too thin, but why stretch it even more?

So, the Spirit hero will also be Hobbit? ****, I hoped for Spirit Aragorn.

Why? Because one of the spoiled cards reads something like "Attach to a Hobbit or Ranger".

I guess Aragorn will be the Gandalf of the Black Riders, a 5 cost neutral ally for one turn or something.

Fatty or Maggot would be funny.  Fatty #1 because of his name (would be a shame if they put Fredegar) and hes that character that is yea part of the group but not really that important.  Not sure if anyone is into anime but he reminds me of Yadjirobe from DBZ.  Farmer Maggot would be sweet if they made an ally which was his dog, we need more creature cards! ha

They use Pippin and Merry instead of Meriadoc and Peregrin, so I definitely think he will be called Fatty. Fatty is also a good choice because it would have been so easy for him to go on the quest with Frodo, but he didn't. This time you can implement some revisionist Tolkien.

now that they have been announced it seems kind of obvious that it was always going to be these heroes. presumably FFG wants these boxes to be able to be played standalone, just with the core-set. and you cant play the story in the first book without these guys -- so it had to be these.

 

i suppose that means each subsequent box will only include heroes that appear in that book too.

the second book introduces the rest of the fellowship, but most of them already appear as heroes in the core set. so maybe they wont feel the need to give us duplicates of those. what other heroes appear in the second book that aren't already in the core set? the only big names i can think of are gandalf (as a hero, not an ally), elrond, celeborn and galadriel

so i think that anduril will be an artifact that gives aragorn a tactic icon. i know that it usually the artifacts are items, but ring of barahir has 3 traits, so i dont see why anduril wouldnt have 'weapon, artifact'

I really like this idea. Hoping it comes to fruition. I had thought that our next Aragorn would be tactics for this reason but I think I like the anduril idea even more

Well, sometime in the far-off future, I think we'll see a version of Aragorn in every sphere. He's one of the few people who actually fit in all the spheres. Then you'd have an Aragorn for all occasions!

I had two immediate responses when I saw these heroes (both echoed here in this thread)

 

1) After hoping for the longest time that more Hobbit cards would be released, we can not only play a viable hobbit deck, but actually spread things wide enough to have two semi hobbit decks play in tandem.

 

2) Wow, now secrecy becomes that much more of an option.

 

I'm all for expanding the ways my group can play through early adventures.  Very excited for this expansion.
