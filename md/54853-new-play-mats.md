im looking for a mat with cool artwork, an example of which can be found here http://www.oggames.co.uk/artists-of-magic-dragon-castle-playmat.html [http://www.oggames.co.uk/artists-of-magic-dragon-castle-playmat.html]

i looked for LOTR ones but doesnt seem to be any, perhaps a good thing for FFG to bring out? anyways im loving that dragon so might just go for that one

The Khazad-dum box cover painting would be a great choice for getting the ball rolling on these... just saying. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 If you go to boardgamegeek.com there are a few fan made mats/player aids that are pretty cool.

Have you ever visited The Game Crafter [https://www.thegamecrafter.com/]? They can usually take a design and make it into a professionally made accessory. I've used them mostly for cards, but they do all kinds of gaming accessories.
