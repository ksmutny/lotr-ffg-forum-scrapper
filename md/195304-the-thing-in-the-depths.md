Sam Gamgee ally without Frodo is a bit meh but in Saga, he is even more awesome as you don't have to use Spirit Frodo. Nice to see Sam as an ally no matter what.

Also, interesting that they chose a squid/kraken like creature for the Thing in the Depths. A bit redundant with the octopus-like Watcher, I was expecting more of a huge sea-serpent or water-dragon, but I'm not complaining. They had to put more enemies in there, and tentacles end up being the best choice for that.

 

Also, is it just me or are there 2 encounter sets just in this pack?

 

Edit: nevermind, the very article mentions it.

Call me one of those who don't like the theme. But the mechanics look promising. My favourite card so far is "Hold Steady!", but the kraken cards also look cool.

 

I'm not so deep into LOTR lore, so could someone tell me if there are mermaids and stuff like that in Middle earth? I mean, are there some good underwater guys like Namor or, cough, Aquaman, cough

I thought about it too, but then I remembered lack of such things in previous cycles (Chief Turch, Dru-buri-Dru, etc.) and desided that this is too good to be true.

Hey now--don't be knocking Spirit Frodo! He's a hero, Mr Frodo is. Like in the great stories! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Jokes aside--I was literally just about to type how awesome Ally Sam will be in a Saga playthrough.

Please no! I am done with Heroes I can't use in any quest. It was bad enough in the Sagas but Amarthiul worries me that it will become a trend. I love the flavor of it but I DO NOT like rebuilding my decks for each quest.

I like the Kraken. It lets me imagine Gandalf--fresh off his successful bout against the Balrog--has decided to take on Cthulhu.

 

It is a little redundant with the Watcher though. Doesn't bother me but I can see it.

Agree fully with your statement of Watcher thingy.

## 16 [John Constantine on December 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195304-the-thing-in-the-depths/?do=findComment&comment=1924695)

What do you guys mean by redundancy with the Watcher? From all I can tell, the quests are completely different (have you read the article? how those new tentacle thingies work? and that's just the second part of the quest, the first one you fight the pirates). And not just that, but the adversary itself is a giant squid, unlike the Watcher who is more of an octopus!

## 17 [Gizlivadi on December 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195304-the-thing-in-the-depths/?do=findComment&comment=1924706)

The mechanics of the Kraken are obviously new, but I'm talking about thematic redundancy, in that it's another octopus-like boss with tentacles. Don't get me wrong, I'm fine with it, but when they hinted at this pack in the cycle announcement, I thought it was going to be a sea-serpent rather than a squid.

 

Edit: Specifically, I was thinking of this card:

Well, to speak of thematic redudnancy, we fight orcs 90% of the time and everybody is ok with it, but once in a while we get something like that and it instantly gets labeled as thematic redundancy? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

It's like calling Journey in the Dark a redundant quest because we already have Shadow and Flame.

Well, we get to fight orcs 90% of the time because they are the most common foot-soldiers of Sauron and we know they are almost everywhere. As far as we know, there was only 1 creature like the Watcher, and he dwelt inside Middle Earth. When creating a new monster in the sea they had total freedom to create whatever they wanted, they didn't have to make something similar to the Watcher again.

How is it similar? It's a squid, not octopus. And it's giant, compared to the Watcher. To make the quest mechanic work properly, they needed something with appendages.

> To make the quest mechanic work properly, they needed something with appendages.

 

And that's why I'm fine with having it, as I said. Still, octopus and squid are similar to me, considering there are other very different types of creature they could have used.

You know you're reaching when you say that thing remotely similar happened years and cycles ago is "redundant". And squids and octopuses are pretty different.

I agree that it's going to be pretty different than Watcher in the Water.  I also don't think Gizlivadi is pushing the point so much.

I think it's perfectly fine that the Karken/boss monster is a tentacled creature. It suggests that even though they may be slightly different, they also share a common ancestry. IMO, too many totally unique monsters stretches credibility (yes, I know, this is a fantasy world and everything stretches credibility  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ).

Does the Sam ally mean that we get a new version of Frodo? Perhaps a lore one?

What makes you think that? He was obviously created for the Spirit Frodo, and even the article references it.

Cause it would be a shame if Sam was limited to only one single hero version. Also, I have Frodo somewhat connected to that whole ship setting. I know we're not talking about post LOTR, but I somehow imagine a wiser Frodo sailing on a ship and kicking the asses of...

Well, you can always play him in Saga quests that include Frodo hero :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I wouldn't rule out possibility of another Frodo hero (or another hobbit hero in this pack), though, because there is a hobbit event art spoiled.

> Does the Sam ally mean that we get a new version of Frodo? Perhaps a lore one?

 

Like @John Constantine said, I think he was designed primarily for Spirit and Saga Frodo. Still, I would love to see another Frodo considering how important he is and how many Aragorn's we have at this point. Though I don't know about Lore...Spirit does seem to fit him best. Maybe Spirit Ally Frodo? Or a Leadership Frodo?

 

As for the Kraken-squid and whether it is or isn't redundant considering the Watcher-pus...

 

Squid and Octopus are, in fact, very different things. But for most people they inhabit a very similar place in our perception. They are the things in the ocean with all the freaky tentacles and no skeleton. Maybe people remember that one gets super big and the other is the purple-ish sushi they see on the conveyor belt and don't eat.

 

From a thematic standpoint we are fighting a big boss enemy battering us around with tentacles. It's not the same but it is thematically similar.

> Wow, this quest sounds complex. Also, I like the art on ally Sam much more than the art on hero Sam.

I am the exact opposite. I think the art on hero Sam is one of the best art pieces in the game. Even the sword and backpack look amazing. How elvish he looks just furthers the idea and concept that some hobbits were a bit more elvish than others or perhaps had a bit of elvish blood and his scar shows how he has turned from a simple farmer to a noble hobbit warrior/adventurer.

The ally version is just a fat ass ugly hobbit lol

The garden and background and house look amazing but Sam himself looks awful. He looks way too old too (he should look younger than Frodo because well... he is younger than Frodo!). 

 

I think the ally is pretty weak too. Never going to defend with him even at 2 defense as he has 2 hitpoints so scrap that idea. So essentially you can pay a spirit resource to give +1 willpower or +1 attack (I know you get both but you wont get use out of both) to an ally..... oh and only when someone raises their threat... 

why would I not just use those spirit resources to play other 1 or 2 cost allies with 1 or 2 questing power... 

I'm sure there will be niche uses for him or at one cost with Frodo just with his stats he is pretty **** decent for his cost (ability still sucks though, you can just trigger it more often with Frodo) but overall I think he is pretty mediocre and more a "fun" card than a useful one.

Gosh sam is OP.  and people call spirfindel over powered!  and on top of that, he is a hibbit with all the pirks and also allows for bill.  to much goodness for one card if you ask me. He is like spirit bofur, who is already ok, except you can get him in anytime for 1 with frodo in play + he has his extra boost thing.  over the top.

I think this is just a matter of personal opinion. While the art on hero Sam is pretty good and it shows his "elven warrior" side during the Cirith Ungol chapter, I think I just prefer to have "the" card representing Sam showing his more gentle and hobbity side we get to know and love during the course of the books. Clearly the art on ally Sam is supposed to represent the latter, and there's nothing wrong with that.

Hmmmmm nothing springs to mind.....

There are the various Valar and Maiar that take on aquatic forms and live in/guard the seas.

Ulmo and his vassal Osse and others I do not remember. I think there was an enormous whale though...? Would be pretty epic to have an encounter with a huge whale that is actually a Maiar in that form!!!

Ulmo in the various pictures we have of him looks a fair bit like a merman so it is definitely possible that there are creatures or vassals or servants of his that may have forms similar to mermaids/merman etc. There is nothing explicitly outlined or talked about in tolkiens works as far as I am aware however. Sea serpents are mentioned... I hope we get a sea serpent in this cycle.... I definitely think the giant squid is still cool and don't mind it is similar to the watcher (and the ancient marsh dweller which everyone has forgotten about!) but would definitely prefer to see an epic sea serpent instead or hopefully as well.

oh yeah no to each his own. I think the actual art itself on the card is really good I just really don't like the depiction of Sam personally. A bit superficial of me really but hey this is a fantasy world! I want everyone and everything to look beautiful/amazing  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

jokes aside definitely just a matter of preference. I like seeing the badass warrior side of Sam (that he was more or less forced to become) and you like seeing the gentler and average hobbit side of him that makes his various accomplishments seem so much more impressive and meaningful. Both equally important and interesting sides of a great character!

Yeah but his boost costs you a spirit resource every time you want to use it.... definitely not worth it in my opinion when you think of what else you could be spending those resources on...

In the last three cycles, with three exceptions, each hero had at least one thematically-connected card in their pack that matched their sphere. For example, in Angmar Awakened: Merry had Curious Brandybuck and Hobbit Pony, Dori had Longbeard Sentry, Erestor had Galdor of the Havens, Amarthiúl had Guardian of Arnor, and Arwen has Elvish Light and Tale of Tinuviel. The exceptions are Mirlonde and Rossiel (Advance Warning and Leave no Trace are connected mechanically, not thematically), and Mablung (where Galdhon Archer and Bow of the Galadhrim both support the cycle's Silvan focus). The article said it would be a Spirit hero, and both Spirit cards in this pack are hobbit-themed, so a hobbit hero seems likely. Since there are already Spirit hero versions of Frodo, Merry, Pippin, and Fatty (and Sam is an ally here), there's a good chance we'll continue the Mirlonde-Idraen-Rossiel tradition of the second pack having an FFG-created (female?) hero. We could also get a new Bilbo hero, Rosie Cotton, Farmer Cotton, Farmer Maggot, or even Folco Boffin.

 

A detail I noticed in the last two announcement articles:

>  
> 
> Flight of the Stormcaller introduces a new Leadership hero and three copies each of ten different player cards.

>  
> 
> The sixty new cards in The Thing in the Depths allow you to determine the course of the resulting battle, even as they introduce a new Spirit hero and three copies each of eight different player cards, including innovative new allies for each of the four spheres.

 

It looks like they're giving themselves more design space by allowing for some quests to have more new encounter cards, while still roughly keeping the same player card progression rate.

 

On another point, I would love it if the support for decks with fewer than three heroes (mentioned in the Flight of the Stormcaller announcement article) were worded so that it helps a deck with two regular heroes and one saga hero. I would love to play the quests from The Land of Shadow and the sixth saga box with a thematic Galadriel-Sam-Frodo deck, using very few allies (Gandalf and Elrond, with some Gondor rangers in The Land of Shadow). This needs more support to work, and it would be disappointing if such a card (intended to support decks that don't use a full set of heroes) doesn't work for saga quests.

Good catch on the number of player cards in the packs. It seems that it will depend on the number of encounter cards in the pack, in that they want some packs to have more encounter cards for mechanical reasons, but the player card pool of the whole cycle will remain intact.

That depends. Desperate times call for desperate measures. Given the fact that he can be readied during the quest if you're lucky, then he is 3 wp for questing and then 2 atk/def for combat. Doing this each turn will obviously put a dent on your economy, however he costs 1 (I don't think I'll be ever running him without Frodo) and that leaves some space for triggering his ability, especially when it makes the difference between defended and undefended attack, or those pesky 1-2 attack you're lacking to defeat a worthy foe looming over you.

Tactics Boromir goes great with ally Sam. Spirit Frodo is also good there -- as you can use A Good Meal to lower threat cheap. Now I just wish Bill the Pony was no longer Leadership, but of course he is meant for the hero Samwise.

Ah that's very true, if his ability is triggered before quest resolution you can get both the extra will and then extra attack.

Yeah in a Frodo deck I suppose he is decent, mainly for his cost... but his ability as well. Was a little too quick to judge as usual :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Well, I still think it is better (or easier in a way) to use Boromir every round than play a Doomed card every round. Though, I have to say, I have not been exploring the Doomed avenue that much, mostly because I do not play Strider so often. I like some cards, mainly Deep Knowledge a lot, but not the whole deck made around the strategy.

In a kind of unrelated note, man, they've been quick in announcing the AP's of this cycle! We haven't even had another preview for the Grey Havens and we're already announcing pack #2. And on the other hand, it's been a while since The Land of Shadow was released and we don't know anything about the Flame of the West other than the title. I think they're building the expectations to the max.

I don't think there are any direct mermaid references in the standard LOTR but "the book of hidden tales" mentions several early draft versions of Earendel's journey where he encounters and befriends mermaids/sirens.

Although they no longer appear in "the silmarillion" Tolkien did consider them during the evolution of the middle earth history.

I too expected the Flame announcement before the second pack. On the other hand, I think they tend to announce the adventures within the cycle in a rather quick succession. I just didn't expect the first one to come relatively early after the deluxe. How is the recent practice with the deluxe, did we get many previews for the last one? I believe it was the main one (including the "about" page which is now missing, I believe), then not much for a while, and then one closer to the release? And do you guys believe we get The Grey Havens before the year is out as they claimed?

Honestly, I think the worst part of Ally Sam is his name. He's a great card, no doubt--but are you going to switch Hero Sam (and probably Bill and Hobbit Cloak) out of your Hobbit Deck? I mean, if you aren't running Sam in the first place then sure but he's probably the most common of the Hobbit Heroes to hit the table. 

 

I actually think Ally Sam will see a lot more play (at least in the short term) in non-Hobbit decks utilizing Frodo as a defender. He has a sphere match and is dirt cheap with Frodo on the board, plus synergizes with Frodo's ability. And if you weren't building primarily for Hobbit synergy then it's not as much of a loss to lose access to Hero Sam.

But of course you can have more decks ready at once. I too used to be concerned by this but it is rather inevitable to have the great characters in more alternatives. And it is only good when more of them are playable. I was actually hoping for a Tactics hero Glorfindel because the Lore one is not really that great but getting a powerful Spirit ally is also very nice.

Don't you still need a leadership hero to pay the cost? I thought if the cost was 0, you still needed a hero to match the sphere. Here's hoping for a new Leadership Hobbit!

Not denying that. I think we agree that the Watcher is octopoid but not an actual octopus. I'm considering the various tentacled monsters in Tolkien (and those now created by the game designers) to share a common "Cthulhoid" origin (did Melkor corrupt the ancestors of the kraken and Watcher into Cthulhoid abominations?). Not necessarily implying that the creatures actually come from Lovecraft's universe... although who knows???

" 'Not safe for ever,' said Gandalf. 'There are many things in the deep waters; ..." (from the Council of Elrond) Personally, I always imagined Gandalf was talking about deep ones or something Lovecraftian like that. A kraken will also fit the bill nicely.

Looks like we know the hero, via Game Trade Magazine:

 

For some reason it's not letting me post the picture, but the hero is Lanwyn.

9 threat

2 WP

3 Atk

1 Def

3 HP

 

Dale. Scout.

Ranged

Response: After an encounter card with surge is revealed, either ready Lanwyn or give her +2 WP until the end of the phase. (limit twice per phase)

 

I don't like it.  3 attack and ranged in spirit?  The spheres mean nothing.

I think she's fantastic. Firslty I love the art, and just being a 9 threat hero with 3 attack is great, And finally that ability is pretty decent. If you're running Lore you can use Henamarth to selectively quest with her for 4. I like her. The only gripe is being Dale since it doesn't have any trait synergy but who cares, first Dale hero in a while.

Well, Dale means nothing, but Scout means a little and looks like it will have more support in this cycle.  Right now there's only one scout attachment (Warden of Anor), and it's a when-quest buff.  So making this hero Spirit gives her one toy to support in-sphere, and since her ability is essentially when-quest, that's a good thing.  Maybe she'll get another spirit scout quest buff of her own, which would benefit Idraen as well.

 

This would make three scout heroes, all having 3 attack, two having ranged, and none being in tactics.

Where all those tactics-only enthusiasts were when 2/3/1/3 Ranged Lore Haldir got released? And that one can attack the staging area too, which to me is more of a Spirit thing to do. And speaking of something "tactics only", out of 3 printed ranged Tactics heroes, only legolas is at the threat cost of 9, other two guys are 10 and 11. It won't change one thing: tactics has a lot of stuff to pump that ranged stuff into oblivion, and spirit has little to none. And that's where true sphere identity lies.

 

About possible Dale synergies, I can totally see them not implementing a single Dale synergetic effect, and here is the reason: they might want to keep Dale as this "runaway" trait when they can design somehting powerful with that trait and not be afraid it will get tout of hand with some side faction synergy.

She does not needs to trigger her ability on regular basis, it's just a nice addition to her overall strong stat box.

In some scenarios there is no surge, so she loses her ability. I agree that her stats are very good, but Haldir with same stats can attack staging area. Maybe switching doomed for surge isn't a good idea, but she should be able to use her ability more often with help of some atachments

The cards "gain surge" so it's like they are there form the beginning. Otherwise they would have written "cards with a printed "surge""

Idraen and Theoden are both 2/3/2/4. Those are combat stats in Spirit. For me, sphere identity is more about theme and ability. You can't build an entire combat-focused Blue deck without basing it around their core identity - attacking the staging area, threat management to selectively engage, action advantage. Just like a mono-Lore combat deck feels like a sphere-focused control deck.

I don't see why her ability wouldn't happen due to cards that "gain surge".  I'm fairly certain Minas Tirith Lampwright's ability can be triggered as a result of cards that gain surge as well, although, I suppose I don't know if that has been officially ruled on or not.

I'm pretty sure you can use her response with a card gaining surge. Otherwise the cards would have been worded like ' When a card with the printed keyword surge is revealed'.

But i don't know when the response triggers. For example, if a treachery with Surge and an effect dealing damage to all exhausted characters is revealed, can I trigger the response and ready Lanwyn before the when revealed effect applies?

And again a FFG created hero on the 2d AP.
Like Mirlonde, and Idraen and Rossiel :-)

Late to the party, but wow, Lanwyn is bonkers. (Even if her name seems more Rohan than Dale to me.). She is what Idraen should have been.

As far as lamenting tactics I've given up. I think the designers have too.

She says "after" a card is revealed, which at the very earliest places it after the When Revealed effect.

Didn't the Rohirrim originally descend into Rohan from the upper vales of the Anduin? There could be some genetic or cultural similarities there. Unless I'm forgetting where the Men of Dale came from.

Her name sounds more Celtic-Welsh to me than Old English, but I see the similarity to Eowyn.

Maybe she's another Lannister.

So is Lanwyn going to have a Warden of Arnor-esque unique attachment?

 

'Response: When an encounter card is revealed but before resolving any of that card's keywords or "when revealed" effects, exhaust this attachment to have that card gain Surge.'

 

(I just thought I'd design a card that would cause even more grief than Grima...)

Sounds like an awful card and I love Grima :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

> Where all those tactics-only enthusiasts were when 2/3/1/3 Ranged Lore Haldir got released? And that one can attack the staging area too, which to me is more of a Spirit thing to do. And speaking of something "tactics only", out of 3 printed ranged Tactics heroes, only legolas is at the threat cost of 9, other two guys are 10 and 11. It won't change one thing: tactics has a lot of stuff to pump that ranged stuff into oblivion, and spirit has little to none. And that's where true sphere identity lies.

I don't see the point in describing the game as is since I was talking about what I would prefer. It seems to me you yourself do that quite often. I think it is a shame that Legolas is the only 9 threat ranged hero in tactics. By the way the Outlands hero is also ranged for 8 threat in leadership, which annoys me. Look, basically I think any stats can be available to any hero in any sphere. I would just prefer if only high threat heroes had off color stats. So, red would have the low threat high attack, spirit would have low threat high wp. I also think ranged should be common in red, but rare and high threat cost in other colors. I don't run the company or the game design so my opinion doesn't matter, but that doesn't mean it's silly or ig oran of the game. I will still probably use her and enjoy the game.

It seems unlikely that she'll have any specific support in this pack. Two Spirit cards from the pack have already been spoiled (Sam and Elevenses) and this pack only has eight (non-hero) player cards. If she had an attachment designed to fit with her, it would almost certainly have to be neutral, which means another sphere would only get one player card. Shadow and Flame is the only previous adventure pack with less than 2 cards in a given sphere: Hands Upon the Bow was the only Tactics card. (Although, to be fair, this is the first adventure pack with only eight player cards. There are also saga expansions with only one card in a given sphere.)

Do we know that Lanwyn comes from this (The Thing from the Depths) pack?  How?

She is in a card fan with other Thing in the Depths cards, and the caption at the bottom says The Thing in the Depths.

I love that her "Ranged" attack is her falcon!

Nice catch. An actual falcon attachment that plays on a Scout would be so cool.

Yep pretty awesome, reminds me of Mordecai in Borderlands!

 

Her flavour text/quote seems to reference the men of dale using birds or falcons as messengers and having some sort of trick that allowed them to understand the birds. Perhaps this concept of being more connected to animals and the ability to use them (maybe just birds but perhaps birds, oxen, even wolves trained to be guard animals or whatever) more effectively as weapons or tools than say Rohan, Gondor etc is a cool identity they could potentially give to Dale.

This is totally random, but I subscribe to a channel on Youtube called SciShow, and the host Hank Green regularly interviews this woman Jessi from a local zoo who brings on various animals.  It's as if she posed for the art of Lanwyn (skip to 12:11).  I'm never going to be able to look at Lanwyn without seeing the connection, kind of like Elrond ally and Steven Seagal.
