 I just played the Tactics deck straight out of the box in solo and while winning (scored 44 points), I felt constantly frustrated.  Gimli became a beast with 6 attack but I had to keep using him to quest.  Furthermore, a string of locations really hoses this deck badly.  I had several turns in a row of sending in heros while still taking 4 threat and making no progress on the locations that were punishing me.  I was keeping Legolas ready for attacks with his special ability and often came up with nothing for him to do.  Enemies had a very short lifespan but without better Will on characters and no will on allies, the deck really suffers and I felt odd having characters quest who really should be doing something else.  

In comparison, the lore deck (scored 30 out of the box) seemed much more flexible and balanced.  Denethor blocks, Glorfindel quests (and occasionally attacks), while Beravor usually attacks with ally help.  This allows D and B to use their action abilities if they don't end up fighting.

 

Other peoples thoughts on mono tactics?

Friends don't let friends play solo mono-tactics decks.

Agreed. Tactics solo is brutal.

How on Earth did you win that game? Taking four threat a few turns should have seen you hit 50 way before ending the scenario.
