I have SoG in my hand. At the beginning of The Planning Phase I pay 2 resources to attach it to a Hero. Can I then exhaust SoG immediately and use the 2 resources generated to pay for additional ally and attachment cards from my hand? Or do I have to wait for the Planning Phase in the next round?

 

I have scrutinised the rules and FAQ and can't seem to find a conclusive answer.

 

The closest is on page 30 of the rulebook when it says that in green steps "Any player can take actions generally". Which would seem to suggest that I can. But it hardly seems definitive.

 

Any help, much appreciated!!!!

Yes, you can exhaust it immediately after attaching it to a hero and use the generated resources.

Actions that are limited to certain phases have that phase included in their activation such as "quest action" or "combat action"  Any card that is simply "action" can be used during any window of opportunity.

 

Attachments can only be played during the planning phase, but the action on it can be activated at any action window, including immediately after playing it.
