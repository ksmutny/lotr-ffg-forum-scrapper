The following is my idea for playing the Shadows of Mirkwood series of Adventure Packs as a series of linked games where the outcome of each game influences the play of the next.

 
--------------------------------
 
Deck Construction
 
Players will use the same deck for all 6 adventures.
 
You will need to construct 50 card decks as per the normal tournament construction rules from the rulebook.  However the following cards may not be included in any decks for this campaign:
 * Dunedain Mark
 * Dunedain Warning
 * Dunedain Signal
 * Dunedain Cache
 * Dunedain Quest
 * Beorning Beekeeper
 * Eagles of the Misty Mountains

Gameplay
 
Play each game following the normal rules.  If you win you receive a bonus, if you lose a penalty.  (In the rare case when one player is eliminated, but the other is able to win, the winning player gets the bonus, and the eliminated player the penalty)
 
Between games completely reset the player decks, heroes, and threat counters as if a separate game was being played, with the exceptions noted below in the bonuses and penalties section.
 
Bonuses and Penalties
 
The Hunt for Gollum
 
Bonus - The signs of Gollum's passing prepare the party for the travels ahead.  For each Clue card attached to a character at the end of the game, that character may attach to themselves one attachment with "Dunedain" in the title.  The same attachment may not be taken twice.  This card begins the next and all future games in play on the hero it was last attached to.  If it is discarded by an encounter effect or a dying hero, it is removed from the game.
 
Penalty - The party has had trouble finding signs of Gollum's passing and must spread out further to search.  Each player must remove 2 allies with the Scout or Ranger trait from their deck.  If they do not have 2 such allies, then they must remove any two allies from their deck.  They will not be available in future games.
 
A Conflict at the Carrock
 
Bonus - Grimbeorn thanks the party for their help and offers one of his followers to help the party on their quest.  Each player may place a Beorning Beekeeper ally in play at the start of the next game.  As long as the Beorning Beekeeper remains alive, he will begin each of the remaining games in play as an ally.  If he is discarded for any reason, remove the card from the game.
 
Penalty - The trolls continue to waylay travelers in the area patrols must be increased to watch out for them.  Each player must remove 2 allies with the Warrior trait from their deck.  If they do not have 2 such allies, then they must remove any two allies from their deck.  They will not be available in future games.
 
A Journey to Rhosgobel
 
Bonus - The Eagles are grateful to the party for saving Wilyador.  Each player may place a Eagles of the Misty Mountains ally in play at the start of the next game.  As long as the Eagles of the Misty Mountains remains alive, they will begin each of the remaining games in play as an ally.  If they are discarded for any reason, remove the card from the game.
 
Penalty - The same poison the killed Wilyador has affected some of the creatures in the party.  Each player must remove 2 allies with the Creature trait from their deck.  If they do not have 2 such allies, then they must remove any two allies from their deck.  They will not be available in future games.
 
The Hills of Eymn Muil
 
Bonus - Although a difficult passing, the characters grow in strength and skill as they over come the terrain.  Each player may attach to a hero they control one attachment with "Dunedain" in the title.  The same attachment may not be taken twice by a player.  This card begins the next and all future games in play on the hero it was last attached to.  If it is discarded by an encounter effect or a dying hero, it is removed from the game.
 
Penalty - The players are worn out by their passing and forced to abandon some of their equipment in order to pass though the hills.  Each player must remove 2 restricted attachments from their deck.  If they do not have 2 such attachments, then they must remove any two attachments from their deck.  They will not be available in future games.
 
The Dead Marshes
 
Bonus - The experience hunting Gollum in the Marshes has given the party valuable insights.  Each player may attach to a hero they control one attachment with "Dunedain" in the title.  The same attachment may not be taken twice by a player.  This card begins the next and all future games in play on the hero it was last attached to.  If it is discarded by an encounter effect or a dying hero, it is removed from the game.
 
Penalty - The party must make another attempt to capture Gollum.  If they fail a second time, the Dark Lord's servants have captured him and the players lose the campaign.  If they win on the second attempt, the players don not receive the bonus and begin the final game with +2 threat each as the extra time in capturing Gollum has allowed the creatures of Mirkwood to prepare for their arrival.

Some notes on my idea.

 

I prefer building general decks to building my decks for specific quests.  So, part of the challenge of this campaign is to build decks that can be successful at all 6 of the Adventure Packs.

 

I tried to pick bonuses and penalties that were meaningful without being game-breaking.  I felt the first 3 were nicely thematic, but would welcome suggestions for better bonuses for Emyn Muil or the Dead Marshes.

 

I primarily play 2-3 player games.  In theory this should work solo as well, although the final adventure will still be nigh impossible from what I understand.

 

I also tried to keep things relatively simple.  There is very little bookkeeping and it should be possible to play the campaign over multiple days/sessions while not having to remember the state of the game, merely wins and losses.

 

So, what do you think??

Interesting variant.  Pretty well thought out.  I'll give it a try when I get some time and report back.

I like the general idea alot.  However, in the specifics, i don't think that trimming your deck is much of a disadvantage.  For the right deck, losing would actually make your more powerful.

I considered that.  I went that route for a couple of reasons.  I figured losing a couple of cards shouldn't impact the odds of cards turning up to significantly.  Also, it seemed that if you have to build one deck to handle all 6 scenarios, it was unlikely that you would have room for many junk cards you wished to get rid of to thin your deck out.  Also, the discards are targeted.  Losing the first scenario, could cause you to lose 2 Northern Trackers, which would certainly have impact later on.

That being said, it also seemed like the least bookkeeping involved and didn't require remembering anything in-game.  Another possibility for a penalty would include starting with a wound on each hero.  Which made sense to me for Rhosgobel as the party would have used its supplies on Wilyador.  That would potentially make Emyn Muil really tough with all of the wounding treachery cards it has.  Or there could be reduced hand-size at the start and I already used increased threat.
