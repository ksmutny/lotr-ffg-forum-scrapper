Do I have to travel to every location before I finish a quest card or the complete scenario? Can I still win with locations in my staging area? Thanks.

As long as the Quest Card doesn't require it, you can leave whatever you want in staging. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
