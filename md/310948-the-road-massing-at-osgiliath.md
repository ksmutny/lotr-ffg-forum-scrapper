The Saga has ended, but the Road goes ever on. Before Frodo ever set out from Bag-end, rumours of war drift across the Anduin to the ears of Denethor, Steward of Gondor. Trusting only to the report of his highest councillors, Boromir his eldest, and Prince Imrahil, he dispatches them to Osgiliath to investigate the claims of a force amassing on the eastern banks.

Here is my Playthrough report of Massing at Osgiliath. Hope you all enjoy!

There are reports of increased Orc activity around Ithilien, and you have been sent to investigate. You enter Osgiliath and cross the river. On the outskirts of the city, you see a horde that surpassses all expectations coming down the Morgul Road.
