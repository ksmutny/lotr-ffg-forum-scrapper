So in black Riders it talks about "campaign mode". In the booklet it talks about all "18" scenarios form the 6 expansions.... Is the Hobbit Expansions considered part of the Saga? Are we looking at 3 more expansions or 5 more... and if ti dose include the hobbit.. are there new campaign cards for it.. and do the "treasures" and all that carry on like boons and stuff?

They are talking about 5 new ones that cover Lord of the Rings. The Hobbit expansions are not related in any way. Try reading the booklet next time.
