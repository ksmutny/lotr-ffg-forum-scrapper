I've been going back through the saga campaigns lately and I can't seem to get "Pursued by the Enemy" from Journey in the Dark and "Followed by Night" from Breaking of the Fellowship out of the encounter deck.  Have I missed something?  TIA.

If "Pursued by the Enemy" is earned at the end of Journey in the Dark, it can be removed from the campaign pool through Seat of Seeing. (It might not be earned if the players earn only two burdens--by going quickly enough or killing the Balrog--and choose "Shadow of Fear" instead, but most players seem to find "Shadow of Fear" worse than "Pursued by the Enemy.") If the players explore Seat of Seeing, "Pursued by the Enemy" is likely the best burden to remove, since it had pretty bad When Revealed and Shadow effects.

At the end of Breaking of the Fellowship, the players earn either "Followed by Night" or "Ill Fate" (which I'm pretty sure means that Seat of Seeing can't result in players having neither burden, since one is earned through the campaign card resolution, which is after Seat of Seeing would have removed it from the campaign pool). If "Ill Fate" is chosen, "Followed by Night" won't be in the encounter deck in subsequent quests.

Thank you.  Have to go back through my notes now.
