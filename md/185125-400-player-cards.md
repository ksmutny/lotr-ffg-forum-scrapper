# [400 Player Cards](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185125-400-player-cards/)

As of Escape from Mount Gram.  This does not include heroes, or treasures or boons from the saga campaigns.  Also, I don't have Land of Shadow yet so I haven't included those cards.

 

400 cards may sound like a lot, but a typical rotating card pool will often contain 2000 cards so this really just highlights how slowly our card pool grows.

How evenly distributed are the spheres?

I also meant to mention that there are 61 heroes so far.  I'm working on the full distribution now, but I think it's very tight based upon my binders.

I just did a quick research using cardgamedb: 470 total cards.

 

Leadership: 107 total, where 15 heroes, 34 allies, 23 attachmetns, and 35 events.

 

Lore: 113 total, where 17 heroes, 37 allies, 23 attachments, and 35 events.

 

Spirit: 107 total, where 15 heroes, 33 allies, 24 attachments, and 34 events.

 

Tactics: 106 total, where 15 heroes, 32 allies, 29 attachments, and 30 events.

 

Neutral: 37 total, 1 hero, 10 allies, 16 attachments, and 10 events.

107+113+107+106+37=470

Take away the heroes and Shadows of Mordor cards and we agree. I think that CGD probably added in boons and treasures too.

## 6 [John Constantine on August 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185125-400-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1736482)

Yeah, it did, but I subtracted them. With all the saga stuff there is 514 player cards.

I knew lore had more cards, but 6 is quite a few really with only 2 cards per sphere released in a pack.

## 8 [Djenni on August 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185125-400-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1737502)

How about just one new release that would be player cards only? 

 

Like a new Deluxe Expansion that would be just player cards. That'd be awesome.

I believe that was already asked for before. Unfortunately, I don't think they will ever do that :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Caleb said there won't be an only player card product, sadly. I feel 500 is awfully low for a game that's benn going for 5 or so years.

## 11 [John Constantine on August 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185125-400-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1737549)

Did Caleb put any insight into it? Like, why there won't be any?

## 12 [Gizlivadi on August 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185125-400-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1737561)

He basically said there won't be any because even though player cards are cool, it's the encounter cards and the quests that conform the game itself, so giving a product without a quest would be an unfinished product.

That's too bad.

Um... that would be true for the core set, but I can't agree on that one in the current game state. They do pod quests without player cards, by that merit they are breaking their own rules by giving us an "unfinished product".

I totally agree.

I like how slow the player card pool grows, it gives us time to fully experiment with cards rather than being overwhelmed.

## 17 [John Constantine on August 16, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185125-400-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1738049)

Nice try. But you know, in a backward situation, no one would force you to buy everything immediately and be "overwhelmed", if it's really a problem for you. There is nothing good about slow growth of a player card pool.

- New cards are something meaningful when released

- Players can actually play cards before the next batch arrives with new cards

- No power creep since they can actually design cards and combinations instead of giving every new hero +1 attack

- New players can keep up with the game

 

It's not that I wouldn't like the player card pool to grow, but you can't say there is nothing good about a slow growth of a player card pool at all.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ok, then let me put it that way - fast growing card pool outweights slow growing one tremendously. And I'm not talking ultraspeed here, but right now it's extremely slow. And each packs can only bring so much. A box full of player cards would not hurt anybody.

## 20 [banania on August 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185125-400-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1739500)

That, plus only one deluxe full of player cards would bring something like 12 new heroes and 51 player cards (165 cards total), which is to say, 3 heroes and dozen player cards per sphere.

Not a chance to get to the point of being overwhelmed I think.

 

This could also be a great product for anyone who want a chance at beating the Core Set with only the adding of a deluxe of player cards.

## 21 [JohnGarrison1870 on August 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185125-400-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1743354)

While personal preferences vary of course, I'll just add my voice to the list of those who are fine with the current rate of growth of the player card pool.

 

Although an expansion consisting entirely/largely of player cards would be pretty interesting, and I'd snap it up in a heartbeat, I have no desire to push for one.

 

However, I would like to see "quest card only" expansions. These could just be 30 cards per expansion, which contain nothing but quest cards for approximately 10 new quests. Each expansion would focus on an expansion cycle, and use various encounter sets from that cycle. While you might not be able to play every new quest in a quest expansion pack if you don't have every adventure pack for that cycle, you'd be able to play most of them. At least 2 or 3 of the quests in such an expansion would rely only on the starting expansion for that cycle, so it'd be useful even if you don't have any APs for it yet.

 

This would dramatically increase the value of prior packs. As it is now, I feel it is very wasteful to have 30+ encounter cards for each quest that never get used again. I feel this is a lost opportunity.

 

If FFG never puts out such a product, I might just have to fill the void myself... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Like this?

Yes, like that. But trying to create a product that spans the entire game so far would be risky, as people wouldn't likely buy it if they only had a handful of expansions. I think having a separate pack of quests for each cycle would be best.

 

And yeah, I didn't actually think I was the first to consider this idea. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
