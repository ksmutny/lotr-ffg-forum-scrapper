## 1 [newdarkages on March 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607182)

I've had this game for two weeks now and am enjoying it very much.  I've got some questions regarding gameplay however:

1.) If "Driven by Shadow" comes up as a shadow card, can I use its shadow effect to discard the "Caught in a Web" Treachery card attached to one of my heroes?  I have so far assumed this is a legal move but am not 100% sure.

2.) If a Location leaves the staging area by having a number of progress tokens placed on it (i.e., using Northern Tracker or Snowbourn Scout) equal to the amount of quest points on the Location, is it considered explored?  If I discard "Mountains of Mirkwood" in this way, does its response trigger?  Again, I have so far assumed this is a yes.

3.) In the "Hunt for Gollum" scenario, can I claim an Objective the same turn/phase that I advance from Stage 2B to the next card without the reset occuring?  I.e., can I just leave the Objective(s) in the staging area until the very moment I finish 2B, or do I need to claim it the turn before?  Further, what if the Objective is guarded by the current Active Location, and this Location is explored and Stage 2B finished in the same quest -- can I still claim it and proceed?

1. Yes, but only if you are defending with the hero to whom Caught in a Web is attached (since Driven by Shadow says, "Choose and discard 1 attachment from the defending character."). Note, though, that if the attack is undefended, you CANNOT discard Caught in a Web, since that part of Driven by Shadow's shadow effect only discards attachments you control.

2. Yes. A location is "explored" whenever is has progress tokens on it equal to its quest point value. All relevant responses/effects trigger at that time.

3. Basically, yes. Signs of Gollum can only be claimed at a very specific time. Per p. 5 of the FAQ, players have "quested successfully" after staging, as soon as you determine that the total willpower exceeds the threat in the staging area (i.e. before placing progress tokens). At this point--and ONLY this point--you can claim Signs of Gollum if it is unguarded. THEN you place progress tokens. So, in the scenario you presented, you cannot technically "wait" to claim the objective until the very moment you finish Stage 2B; however, in the instant that you tally your willpower and recognize you will be placing enough progress to finish the stage, you CAN claim the objective BEFORE placing progress. 

This timing answers the second part of your question. Basically, if the objective becomes unguarded after progress tokens have been placed, you won't be able to claim it until the next turn (since it was guarded at the moment when you "quested successfully"). If that were the only Signs of Gollum in play, you would immediately reset the quest deck.

Thank you, and yes, very helpful.  I will try to check out those FAQ's pretty soon, but really quick, here's something that came up last night:

We were playing Passage Through Mirkwood.  During the Combat phase, Player A destroyed an enemy with Legolas, and per Legolas' Response, 2 progress tokens were placed on Stage 2B.  We drew "Don't Leave the Path" for the next quest card, and picked out a Forest Spider and Ungoliant's Spawn, placing them in the staging area.  Player B was playing with Dunhere, who was readied.  Player A was the first player.  Could Dunhere then attack the enemies that were just added to the staging area?  I don't see why not.

Sure. You flip quest cards immediately after placing the requisite amount of progress tokens on them, even if it happens during the combat phase. When you flip to "Don't Leave the Path," its "when revealed" effect triggers immediately. By the time Player B's attack step rolls around, there will be two new targets in the staging area. So, in your example, Player B could indeed attack either spider with Dunhere. In fact, this would work even if Dunhere were under the control of Player A (since Player A can make other attacks besides the one with Legolas). If Dunhere were ready after the sequence of triggers, he could legally attack either spider.

Agreed with 2. and 3.

 

I'm not sure if your answer to 1. is correct. Sure, technically it's true that the card text only says that one ttachment from the defending character has to be discarded. However the text in the bracket implies that Driven by Shadow is directed at player controlled cards: "If this attack is undefended, discard all attachments you control."

I don't think that the game designers ever intended to help a player with this shadow effect by making it possible to remove Caught in a Web, but the card reads as if it was possible. I guess there should be an errata for Driven by Shadow that includes the words "controlled by a player" in the first sentence.

## 7 [starhawk77 on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607733)

It's a literal reading of the card text. Admittedly, straight interpretations of card wording can be problematic in this game (I'm looking at you, Stand and Fight...), so I can see where you are coming from. But there are other attachment discarding effects that specifically mention player "control," while Driven by Shadow does not. I suppose you could read the second part of the effect as implication that the first part couldn't discard Caught in a Web, but that would be you adding meaning to the text beyond the actual words (again, not necessarily the wrong idea in this game). 

In general, I think it's usually best to abide by the literal wording on the card unless it leads to a blatantly nonsensical outcome. Otherwise, you're trying to read Nate's/Lukas's mind(s). There are plenty of encounter cards that can occasionally prove somewhat beneficial, so I don't think the players managing to acquire some advantage from Driven by Shadow is that far-fetched. Some clarification here would be welcome, but I don't know that Driven by Shadow would receive errata, since FFG has been pretty consistent about specifying control in other instances. Seems to me like the effect would have said, "Discard one attachment you control from the defending character" if that had been the intent.

 

## 8 [booored on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607747)

1) - No, not in any way is this legal. Treachery cards that are played as "condition attachments" are NOT attachments. Yes, it is pathetic that they are called attachments but they are so get used to it. When a card is like Caught in the Web is attached to hero the the only way currently to remove it is to cast Miner of the Iron Hills. "Response: After Miner of the Iron Hills enters play, choose and discard 1 Condition attachment from play. " The card Driven by Shadow ONLY effects player cast attachemtns like songs or armour or weapons.... treachery cards turn into "condition attachments" and remain un affected.

## 9 [The_Fallen_Arises on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607820)

 I would tend to agree with booored...it would also be more in keeping with the spirit of a treachery card, which is never meant to really help.

## 10 [Bomb on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607824)

Honestly, I think the text on the card speaks for itself.  I see no reason why the defending character can't have the treachery attachment discarded.  The undefended condition sounds like a way to protect characters that additional players have in play and to increase the penalty for being undefended even further.  The initial effect says nothing about it being an attachment you control.

Also, Treachery cards that become attachments ARE attachments for ALL purposes once their lasting effect(that makes itself an attachment) is in place.  It is now an attachment that you do not control. 

There are Treachery Cards that exist that actually help you more than hurt you sometimes.  The ones that say "Return an exhausted Ally to your hand." for example is tremendous in combination with Allys that have put into play abilities.

But sometimes they can help you.  Canceling cards like those isn't the only way to fight against them.

See Pursued by the Shadow in combination with Gandalf or Snowbourn Scout.  Gandalf being available for his put into play effects again can be huge.

All attachments count as "attachments".

Discard an attachment.............encounter card or player card.

Discard an attachment you control........only player cards.

 

## 13 [richsabre on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607907)

yes the rules (or at least faq) are clear about this- you only control player attatchments

Well...can't argue with that...I stand corrected, and rally to your position. If we abide by the letter of the rules, that's how it should work.

## 15 [booored on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607938)

no... the effect dose not affect condition attachments. End of story. There is no argument about this and it has been confirmed by Nate I am sure of it, though it has been so long I forget when. As has been said you do not control condition attachments, you can not discard them

Forgot to mention objective cards.

So it would be:

Discard an attachment.............encounter card or player card.

Discard an attachment you control........player cards and objectives.

If the attack is undefended, then I completely agree with you because that falls in line exactly with the condition of the shadow effect.  However, I completely disagree when the Condition Attachment is attached to the defending character and this shadow effect is revealed.  It makes no mention of the need to control the attachment you choose to discard.  You should not read past that part of the effect's text because you do not meet the conditional requirement to trigger the undefended portion.

I don't think it's right to dismiss any debate on this subject without a pointer to the ruling.

If the effect said "Discard a Lore character from play (If this attack is undefended, discard a Leadership character from play).", we wouldn't discard a Leadership character from play if the attack is defended, right?

I have no issue with there being a preexisting ruling made from the game designer, but in this case I think the text is clear enough that it would be unnecessary.  Normally, undefended shadow effects are supposed to be a lot stronger, so in this case it is even worse when undefended.

## 19 [The_Fallen_Arises on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607982)

 If there truly is a ruling by Nate on this very subject...it only heightens once again the need for a clarified rulebook...

## 20 [radiskull on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=607993)

 I'm aware of no such ruling, and after searching these forums and the BGG forums, I can't find reference to it.  (Not that the search function here is anything to be confident in...)  But If the attack is defended, Driven by Shadow does not specify that you need to control the attachment you're discarding, so you can discard any attachment, even Caught in a Web (since once it attaches to a character, it is an attachment.)  If the attack is undefended, Caught in a Web stays.

## 21 [booored on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=608030)

Your probably looking for the wrong thing, the ruling wasn't on condition attachments but on how card costs and conditions are met. The condition attachment may be on your card but you do not control it, it is still part of the encounter deck. It is just cast on you. You can not sac it as a cost payment, anymore than you can use any encounter card for any other function. This is highlighted with the keyword "condition attachment" to separate it, but it is the global rule about how card costs work that dictates that this can not be sacked.

I don't understand what you mean by card costs.

It still doesn't make sense that a card named "Driven by Shadow" frees one of your heroes out of a spider web. It just doesn't make sense. And I need no BGG forum to know that.

Imagine everyone is looking for missing Frodo, and then he shows up and everybody is puzzled how the hell he made it out of that trap, and he says: "Guys, you won't believe what happened, but just as the spider wanted to eat me and my second breakfast, a drug driven Orc junkie came along and slew that beast with his bare hands. He must have been driven by a shadow!" Everyone nods in agreement.

And no one would ask him if he controlled that web. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

though my memory be crap im siding with booored- i remember this coming up but it was several months ago, infact could have been last year- so dont ask me for links :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

and i also agree with leptokurt- doesnt make any sense thematically

Infact reading the card i read it like the words controlled were missed out on the first text, it seems to read that the 2nd shadow part is a follow up of the first

Maybe not, but there are a number of encounter card interactions that happen to prove "beneficial," even though the cards themselves appear designed to hinder the players. Freezing Cold can prevent a character like Glorfindel from becoming committed to a potentially fatal Avalanche!-induced quest to complete Stage 2B of The Redhorn Gate. When Many Roads shuffles locations back into the encounter deck, it minimizes Cave Torch's drawback. As much as I enjoy thematic consistency, the rules don't always conform to how card effects "should" play out. 

Personally, I'd be all for an errata to add a control requirement to Driven by Shadow. Unless that happens, or unless someone can produce an official ruling from Nate, the wording is pretty clear. But I don't see a big problem with playing it your way, since you'll only be making things more difficult. If that keeps your conscience clear, so be it--it's the opposite of gaining an unfair advantage. 

Basically, if you want to hamstring yourself, feel freehappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] But the text doesn't obligate you to do so.

You'd think that if it was as long ago as you say, that it would be addressed in the FAQ today.  I think that is what is hanging most of us up on following the text literally.  I mean, the effect makes perfect sense as it is.  The undefended portion is just that much more harsh.

well the thing is that YOU are playing incorrectly and YOU are making it EASIER for yourself. ... now on the surface I do not care about this.. I have said many times that as this game is not pvp it is all about player experience.. make up w/e the **** rules you like... Just know there is 2 things happening here.. 1 you are invalidating all your scores, on this quest and most likely others.. and this is one of the reasons we will never see a torny play system and as much as I admire Juice all this stats and scores are meaningless... as everyone is playing incorrectly, due to no one getting check by there assonants in a competitive environment. Still. this is only the most minor of results.

The real problem here and what i am concerned for you about is that you are failing to understand a basic "supporting structure" of the game so to speak. What I mean is that the game has some basic core rules that everything is built off. The reason you can not sack a condition attachment is from one of these core conceptual rules. So you will make similar mistakes all the time for as long as you play. The card text doesn't specify condition attachments as the core rule dictates what cards you can sac already. The attachment type is just a reminder of this....

It has been said so many time... you can not satisfy the cost of a card or the effect of a card though the payment of a card you do not control. This card is cast on you by the encounter deck, you can not choose to discard it as there is never a choice on your part.. it is not your card to go.. "yeah I choose that". As you need to satisfy the cost of the shadow effect from your own card pool. Ask Nate if you do not belive me... as rich said this came up when teh game 1st came out and there was a ruling about how card payments function.

7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]

 

Edit... Found the ruling.... from the FAQ

(1.06) Control of Non-objective Encounter Cards Players do not gain control of encounter cards unless control of the card is explicitly granted by a card effect. When an encounter card (such as Caught in a Web, CORE 86) becomes an attachment and attaches to a character, that character’s controller does not gain
control of the attachment.

That doesn't matter. Driven by Shadow does not require that you control the attachment. Like I have said approximately ten million times now, Nate may issue an errata/ruling that the card functions as you have suggested. But that would be a change or a clarification: the card as written and the body of rules we currently have mean Driven by Shadow CAN discard Caught in a Web.

As for the argument about paying costs, let's look at the actual rule book text (p. 25):

Paying Costs
Many cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do Y” manner. When confronted with such a construct, everything before the word “to” is considered the cost,
and everything after the word “to” is considered an effect. Costs can only be payed with cards or resources that a player controls. If an effect is canceled, the cost is still considered to have been paid.reset back into the encounter deck.

If Driven by Shadow said something like, "Discard an attachment to cancel this effect," that would fall under this section, since that fits the clearly defined formula of paying costs. You could not discard Caught in a Web to pay that cost, since you don't control the treachery attachment (per the FAQ ruling you yourself cited). DbS doesn't say anything of the sort. There is no cost being paid. There is simply an effect. 

In short, I still see no evidence that suggests Caught in a Web is immune. I appreciate your concern for my invalidated scores, but I'll bet on my interpretation of core rules principles and take my chances. 

Look, we all know that the wording in this game is often less than ideal. This may be one of those cases where Nate intended for a card to function a certain way, but where the execution of the text muddled the original meaning. That's fine, and I'll acknowledge it if I see proof. Short of that, though, there is no reason to assume DbS works in the way you have posited.

So are a lot of other people, apparently. Those of us who play the cards using, you know, the text on the cards. 

I'm going to stop feeding you now, since I don't have radiskull's patience. You've made your case, and I've made mine. The debate is there for players to consider and decide for themselves until such time as someone produces an actual ruling from Nate. I don't think one is even necessary, since the resolution seems clear, but that might be the only way to get clarification here.

 There is absolutely no cost of any kind on Driven by Shadow.  Any discussion of cost in that context is erroneous.  Control of the attachment you are discarding is irrelevant (in the defended case).  The text of the card is clear.  I like to think I understand this game pretty well, and I'm pretty **** confident that Driven by Shadow's text contains no sort of cost.

To accuse your fellow forum-goers of missing a fundamental aspect of the game which you yourself do not understand (apparently) is, in my opinion, pretty rude.  Especially when stated in the abrasive way you did.

Please produce a clarification by Nate, if you can.

Call me one of those who don't get the whole cost thing. There is no cost to pay, as the defending character has to discard an attachment. And what about Miner of the Iron Hills? Isn't he allowed to discard Caught in a Web, too?

This is a good point. Everyone, including booored I think, uses Miner of the Iron Hills in this way. Let's compare text.

Miner of the Iron Hills: After Miner of the Iron Hills enters play, choose and discard 1 Condition attachment from play.

Driven by Shadow: Choose and discard 1 attachment from the defending character. (If this attack is undefended, discard all the attachment you control.)

So both cards say to "Choose and discard" but the differences are the modifier "condition" and the fact that one removes any condition attachment in play while the other is restricted to the defending character.

That's all I'm gonna say. You guys take it away.

Absolutely. I'm sure the entire purpose of him is to discard threatening attachments like that.

The ability has a Response to trigger it, so the only thing that is needed is the fact that the Minor of the Iron Hills is entering play. Technically it has no cost because it is not in a format of "Do x to do y". If a cost was associated with this effect it may say something like "Response: After Miner of the Iron Hills enters play, exhaust a Dwarf character to choose and discard 1 Condition attachment from play."

Here, X is "exhaust a Dwarf character" and Y is "choose and discard 1 Condition attachment from play".

You don't pay costs for any effects that are not your own unless a rule or card specifies this specifically. A notable one is Eowyn.

"Action: Discard 1 card from your hand to give Eowyn +1 Willpower until the end of the phase. This effect may be triggered by each player once each round."

This one specifically states any player may trigger this effect and it is done by paying it's costs.

As most encounter cards, like Treachery cards, Shadow effects, or Objective cards, they have no costs associated with them. Some may have some ways out of the effect going through where it is like paying for a cost(place 2 resources on Gollum. A player may pay 1 resource to place only 1 resource on Gollum for example), but they are basically effects that just happen. You are not paying anything to enforce or power them.

Think of it this way:

If this game is a walk to a lemonade stand, you might have some encounters on your way to lemonade stand and back.
Someone jumps you and just takes your wallet. This is an example of a Treachery card that just enforces an effect(stealing your wallet).
At the lemonade stand you give the vendor 50 cents to take and drink 1 cup of lemonade(let's pretend it gives you +1 willpower). This is an example of paying a cost for an effect. Do X(pay 50 cents) to do Y(take and drink a cup of lemonade).
On your way home, you find the person that jumped you and beat them over the head with a broken bottle(exhaust a character for a fun reference) to take back your wallet(take back your attachment from the discard pile). This is an example of paying a cost to take back the attachment.

Hope that helps clear it up for you and if not, feel free to comment. :-)

 

## 39 [guest479094 on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=608530)

It seems pretty straightforward...

Attachments = anything attached to character. Player controlled attachments are a subset of attachments. Conditions attachments are a subset of attachments. If the card says "attachments" it automatically includes all attachments whether they are condition attachments and whether or not the player controls them. Thats how sets and subsets work. *Only* if the text limits the sort of attachments meant would it not include all types of attachments.

Driven by Shadows says "Choose and discard 1 attachment from the defending character." "Attachment" is not restricted here and thus includes ALL types of attachments.

I can understand how one might argue that this doesn't make sense thematically but it IS what the card says. So, unless there is some ruling that the card should have said something else (so far it seems no such ruling exists), it seems obvious that Driven by Shadow can discard "bad" attachments. I see no gramatical, logical or rules basis to come to any other conclusion.

A cost for Driven by Shadows? Where the heck is that coming from?

## 40 [autio on March 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=609364)

booored is not only wrong but he is being ignorant.  Perhaps the creators wanted the card to behave the way booored has stated, perhaps not.  Until there is an errata or they explicitly clarify the ruling themselves there is no way for us to tell.  Until that time, the text on the card should be followed.  

The defended part of the card does not specify that you must CONTROL the attachment, while the undefended part specifies that you must discard attachments that you CONTROL. Control is explicitly stated in the undefended portion of the card.  I refuse to believe that they just forgot to state it in the defended portion.  What if the defending character contained only attachments from other players.  With booored's explanation those cards would be unaffected since the defending player does not control them. 

Also, as it has been stated many times previously, there is no cost involved in the shadow card.  The card is entirely an effect.  Therefore, when defended, any attachment on the defended player may be discarded, regardless of control.  Caught in the Web is an attachment, be it a condition attachment or not.  The condition is just a subset of the attachment type.

Yes, he/she would.  Unlike other LCGs, a player assumes control of any attachments played on his/her characters by other players.

Sorry, I recognize I'm teh n00b to this game, but I've come across situations like this one before. My take here is purely a thematic one, so while the card does explicitly state, "Remove attachment," and Caught is "an Attachment," the intent to my way of thinking is that it came from the Encounter deck. The Encounter Deck is "The Home of Bad Things," and not "Suddenly, a party of Elfin Archers ride to the rescue." Looking at the body of the cards, I would frame this with the likely intent, which is to harm the party.

That, as they say, is my 0.02. I'm not saying I'm right! I'm saying that makes the most dramatic and common sense to me.

## 43 [radiskull on March 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=609407)

 Thematically, that sounds right, but you may find that using thematic considerations to answer rules questions will lead to an illogical mess.  (Some would argue that that's already the case, but I'm not among them.)

You have to apply the rules rigidly and non-thematically, otherwise you'll be saying "But Legolas can't use his Rivendell Blade when he's using his Ranged ability - what, he's gonna shoot his sword like an arrow with his bow?"  Down that path lies madness.  Just go with it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks for explaining the "cost" stuff a bit more detailed. Until now a "cost" was only something that you had to pay for with rour resources.

## 46 [booored on March 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=609594)

no cost is anything that you need to do to satisfy a condition on a card. Like say discarding an attachment. You do not control the condition attachments, as they are controlled by the encounter deck, so you can not satisfy that "cost" by discarding that card, you need to choose one of your own player card attachments.

That is not a cost, that is an effect.  Discarding an attachment is what the card does.  Send it to Nate if you don't believe me.  The location that has as a Travel effect "The First Player must discard 2 cards from his hand at random to travel here" is an example of a cost.  "Do X to do Y" is the formulation.  Here, X = discard 2 cards at random, and Y = travel to this location.  Traveling to the location is not the cost of the travel effect by any stretch.

Here is the rulebook's definition of "cost":

"Many cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do
Y” manner. When confronted with such a construct,
everything before the word “to” is considered the cost,
and everything after the word “to” is considered an
effect."

If it doesn't cost resources, and it doesn't have a "pay X to do Y" construction in its text, then it is costless.  Nate will tell you the same thing.

What Radiskull said.

Also, isn't cost always optional? IOW, you may have to do X to get Y, but you also never *have* to do X.

## 50 [radiskull on March 24, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62021-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=609822)

 It depends on the context.  If an event said "Discard an ally you control to eat extra pie", you'd have to discard the ally if you played the event.  It is optional in that you don't have to trigger it, but if you trigger it, you must pay all costs.
