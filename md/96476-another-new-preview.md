looks like elves will be a focus of this cycle!

 

looks like it won't really be a Rohan cycle (which is to be expected, given the previous cycles' player cards not really matching their location) and Secrecy returns!

Wow!  Love what Caleb and Matt are doing.  I liked how he discussed developing a thematic core for a trait, so that it has a strong identity and mirrors the role of the race in the books.  The biggest complaint about Gondor, aside from it being underdeveloped, is that it lacks a clear identity.  With one AP, it seems like Silvan will have a clearly defined role in the game.    

And perhaps we got a little foreshadowing of this with Silvan Refugee and Children of the Sea, both of which look a lot more valuable now (though I always liked Silvan Refugee).

That was so amazing!!! I have been patiently controlling my excitement throughout the wait for Voice of Isenguard, but this... this is just too much to handle! I had a feeling that the Elves were the next group to receive some love, and boy are they indeed.  I couldn't be happier with the direction that they're taking with the Silvan trait, and that Celeborn hero.  Wow!

Aside from my excitement for the Elven developments, I am happy to see that Secrecy will be getting some added options too, making Hobbits even more enjoyable to hide, seek, and quest as.  

 

So ready for this year's Lord of the Rings LCG goodness.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Where previous cycles dedicated a larger portion of cards to their main themes, the player cards in The Ring-maker provide more of a smattering of Middle-earth in order to introduce several new strategies and revive a few older ones too (Secrecy, anyone?). There’s something for everyone in The Ring-maker!

This made me very happy :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Awesome ability on Celeborn. This means we might see Lady Galadriel by the end of the cycle. And it seems like there will be a new focus for each AP--so it will not only be Silvan which gets developed but, in Caleb's words, "a smattering of Middle Earth." Secrecy hint as well. Looking forward to this year!

## 7 [Gizlivadi on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=948467)

I'm in love as well... of the Silvan cuites and of the whole cycle! Wow, what can I say, first of all, Dunland is one of my absolute favorite places in Middle earth and it's great to see that the first adventure pack will be set there. Plus, the dunlending enemies and "culture" (boar-clan, anyone?) look exactly as I wanted them to be. The silvan trait focus is amazing as well, and the player cards shown in the article look all very playable. I'm extremely excited for this cycle.

 

Also, Ost-in-Edhil? FFG has heard my prayers!

Awesome. This is looking great.

I am really curious to see what spirit has in store. So far no spirit cards have been spoiled in VoI previews or this one. They got the short end of the stick in HoN. Hoping to see some interesting things for that sphere.

If it's as good as what i have seen here it should be amazing.

Looks like Rumil response will not work with lore event The Tree People. Nice to see some willpower for tactics, compare him to Bofur which costs 3 and has one more hit point. Is the ability of Rumil that much stronger? Still thrilled regardless.

I like the card. Better than the Beorning beekeeper at least. Assuming you have Legolas it'll be at least 2 damage which is decent.

Absolutely, the history of Eregion is one of my favorite parts of the lore. Caleb and Matt have done their homework and are going deep into the lore. Ost-in-Edhil played a major role in the manufacture of the rings of power and the battle against Sauron, but also in the alienation of the local peoples of the area who later became the Dunlendings. The thematic synergy here is nice and I can't wait to read the story that FFG has written for this cycle. Hopefully we'll see a bit more of the area of Eregion, I'd especially like to see the ruins of Tharbad.

 

I was already excited for this cycle before and I'm over the top excited now.

## 16 [Bullroarer Took on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=948526)

My elves deck (which is my favorite to play) is excited. I hope we see a neutral elven card or two.

But... Celeborn Silvan? What am I missing?

Also, I hope they tie off the few loose ends of the Dunedain cards.

Great job FFG!

I'm glad they haven't abandoned secrecy. I hate when a CCG abandons support for a deficient game mechanic and you're stuck with a whole bunch of cards you'll rarely (or never) use. I trust that Caleb and Matt have taken a hard look at secrecy, identified its weaknesses and now the mechanic will be resurrected in grand style!

 

Plus... more mount support? I'm very curious.

Agreed, agreed. Add to that my hopes for magic ring attachments (either rings of power or just lesser magic rings) and maybe even some lost seeing-stones.

> But... Celeborn Silvan? What am I missing?

I thought the same thing, so I did a little research.

He's listed alternately as Sindarin (earlier) and Telerin (later, maybe). The former seems to be more canonical and is also what Legolas and Thranduil are (even though the former is traited Silvan in the game, probably because they lived with/ruled Silvan elves). I suspect they decided to make it easy and make him Silvan like Leg's rather than introduce another Elf race into the game.

Maybe someone more qualified would care to weigh in, rich? Gizli?

Hmm, I'm no expert on the subject of the different strains of elves, and to be honest I don't really trust ffg's decision to make two elven traits, Noldor and Silvan, because that is not really accurate (should've went with just Elf IMO). That said, if I recall correctly Celeborn was a Sindarin, which may be related but it's definately not the same as Silvan elves. Many silvan elves were ruled by Sindar elves (like Thranduil and Legolas) so it seems they're just repeating the process of naming such characters like Legolas and Celeborn Silvan for economic purposes and because that's the people they ruled. Not something I would have agreed about, but that's just ffg. Then again we got the "Istari" and "Dúnedain" traits which are also a bit weird, as well as no "Man" trait for some reason.

## 24 [Alex6222 on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=948604)

Oh boy so many elves in one pack!! I guess from now on this pack should be renamed "The Silvan Pack" (like the outlands in TSF). Run il is costly but it can have great effect. If you run Legolas and have some Trollshaw scouts you could deal massive damage to enemies. I think Noldor and Silvan would be great for 2 player. My Elven Alliance deck will now see some changes.

I was thinking the exact same thing. I guess I should have suspected this would happen, when Legolas was included in the core set with the Silvan trait. Granted, Legolas even calls himself a Silvan in the books, but I guess they didn't want to include Sindar as a trait. Now that Celeborn will be released with the Silvan trait, it is safe to say that Sindar and Teleri will not be traits in this game. Oh well, it's a small price to pay for what look to be some great cards.

## 26 [Raven1015 on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=948616)

Yeah, since Legolas was released as Silvan, it has seemed pretty clear that FFG was going to stick with just two Elf factions, Silvan and Noldor, and treat Sindar = Silvan. While this isn't accurate, it makes sense from gameplay perspective, as they would be hard-pressed to develop three separate factions. Since the main Sindar characters we get to know in LOTR seem to all lead Silvan Elves, it makes sense that they would share the trait. We can think of Legolas and Celeborn as not being Silvan, but having the trait because they are part of the same "kingdoms" as Silvan Elves.

I am so excited I cannot find a proper way to express myself, I waited Celeborn (and Galadriel) to be in but from though to reality. He could have been spirit cause he was supposed t be the wisest of eleves, but he was a leader also so I guess they mixed leadership with high questing power ... If we manage to get some more elven weapons and also a couple of very strong elve allies then it is enough for me to be quite happy about the cycle  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

PS: Guys , Celeborn was leading silvan elves , I guess thats the reason he has that trait, in order to be connected to the people he was ruling. There is no Sindar or Galahdrim trait to give him and I guess it would be clever to create another elven trait

## 30 [Gizlivadi on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=948634)

I think it should be noted that there was an old Demo hero card for Celeborn in the spirit sphere. Apparently he was ditched for this new design.

Oh my gosh. Amazing. I think I'm more excited for this than I am for Voice of Isengard! And Rumil! YES! That means we'll see an Orophin! And possibly a Haldir hero that will combo nicely with their abilities. You could have all three brothers out at the same time! And more mounts! And more secrecy! And more... Smattering of Middle-Earth! Congratulations to the designers. I couldn't be happier. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This expansion and cycle are just blowing away expectations so far, such a great time to be a fan of this game. The way the cycle is described I wouldn't be surprised if we saw each AP focus on a particular gameplay style. Much more preferable to the old way of waiting for the max potential (or maybe I just harbor bad memories of waiting forever for Anborn and Visionary Leadership).

Cannot wait to play with the silvan elves, looks like an incredibly fun deck archetype to run, the only question now is who the accompanying two heroes will be with Celeborn. A tri-sphere with Elrond and spirit Glorfindel could probably work.

Love that Caleb is hitting his stride here,

I see 3 tactics cards spoiled. that means that they are either changing the AP pack format, or they spoiled a card for a different pack. I feel like the Doomed event is actually supposed to be in VoI.

I also noticed that each of the spoiled player cards has a quote/excerpt on it. I wonder if they are putting more emphasis on that now.

There's already a precedent for this: both Foundations of Stone and Shadow and Flame had 3 (non-Hero) Lore cards. In FoS there was no Neutral player card, and S&F only had 1 Tactics card.

Galadriel seems like a sure bet now (I'm guessing as a Gandalf-esque ally). Maybe we'll even see a new Legolas hero...

Very interesting. Lovely art as usual, not only the characters but the Tree People especially.

 

Now for the Tactics doomed card, I think it fits well. I too had thought Tactics may not be given doomed cards since they have no threat reduction and high threat cost in general, but then I remembered Tactics Boromir. As for this particular event, I believe it can prevent damage dealt to Beorn hero which may be super useful.

## 38 [Karlson on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=948667)

I'd bet my Erebor Boots that Haldir gets his hero debut in the Ring-maker Cycle.  While he is a Lore ally already, I'm thinking he'll receive a Tactics hero incarnation to pair up with the spoiled ally card of his brother, Rumil.   I'm really excited to see the diversity of this cycle come forth too.  While I enjoyed the Dwarf centered Dwarrowdelf Cycle and Gondor centered Against the Shadow, I'm ready to receive a good variety of cards that are unique and bolster both old and newly forming traits.  It's going to be a long wait, I fear!

Plus, I think there have been super good cards spoiled as well with Celeborn, Rumil and of course:

That's a lot of cool stuff. Yummmy!

 

Playing a Silvan deck should be interesting. So far their focus was on healing Silvan characters, thus ensuring to keep them in play as long as possible. Now they're popping in and out of the woodwork like crazy, so there is no real need for playing Silvan Tracker. And Silvan Refugee also has, uh, absolutely zero synergy with their fellow elven comrades...

## 42 [Nickpes on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=948723)

Ok , a thought 

 

You play with Celeborn, Glorfindel (spirit) with Light of Valinor and a Lore Hero (chose one)

 

You have imladrize stargazer in play looking the five cards coming

 

You play Naith guide which quests for 2 cause of Celeborn, you chose Calaborn to quest without exhausting , you have Glorfindel who does the same (you quest for 8 at least), and then play The tree people to take Naith guide back and put in play an expensive ally you know is coming (Haldir, Gildor or whatever) ... so you have Celeborn, Glorfindel and at least that ally ready for combat

Well, Silvan Tracker has so far not been very useful since many Silvan allies only have 1hp and there is no way of increasing it. And I think it shall be reoccurring theme that Silvan fragility. Still, the Tracker works better on heroes perhaps and Celeborn seems a very good candidate with 2 defence.

 

As for the Silvan Refugee, she seems a great candidate for the returning to hand Silvan ally (a feat the new cards seem to share), still, it is probably only useful to have one in play unless you take advantage of Horn of Gondor, for instance - but that should feature in a different deck perhaps.

 

As for the line-up, it again feels like a good idea to have Spirit Glorfindel with Celeborn, at least unless we get a good Spirit Silvan hero to combo. But once you have Celeborn and Glorfindel, it is probably a good idea to have Elrond as well, to get some of those more expensive allies into play cheap with Vilya. Starting threat 29 may not be too bad in such a deck of totally awesome hero stats.

 

Now for Galadriel? She will be Noldor though.

Starting threat 29 may not be too bad in such a deck of totally awesome hero stats.

Just a thought, i put Silvan Refugee into play and he gets +1 willpower, 1+ Attack & 1+ Defense until the end of the round via Celeborn. Then i use the Event The Tree People and move Silvan Refugee to my hand and i do all this during the planning phase. Could i then pay 1 resource and put Silvan Refugee again into play triggering Celeborn's effect a second time giving Silvan Refugee another 1+ W,A & D?

 

Basically through this effect or any other is it possible to gain more than 1+ W,A & D through Celeborn's effect?

 

Or is not possible since the the Event Action window comes after i have finished playing all my allies & attachments?

There is nothing prohibiting you from playing events in the planing phase. But, I don't think this combo would work. I assume once the Refugee is brought back into hand any bonus to stats are removed once it is out of play. But I could be wrong, but very surprised if it was allowed.

## 49 [scottindeed on January 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=948829)

Yes, the stat increases would be removed once the card is taken back into hand.

I SO wanted elves! I already love this pack. I want this more then VoI now!

 

This made me happy too:

 

The Ring-maker provide more of a smattering of Middle-earth in order to introduce several new strategies and revive a few older ones too (Secrecy, anyone?).

 

Guess FFG does read the forums eh?

I remember reading somewhere that once a card is returned to the hand, deck, or discard pile it loses all modifiers to it. This also includes damage which is how you're able to "heal" the Beorn hero card. I think this was in the FAQ somewhere, but I don't have it with me to check. But there's no way you can stack Celeborn's bonus using bouncing effects (sending a card repeatedly from your hand to the table and back again).

Gildor is a Noldor so he won't work, but Haldir is fair game.

And maybe I've been misunderstanding some of you, but I have never been unhappy to pull a Silvan Tracker from my elf deck. He heals Mirlonde every turn and if you are also playing Elrond he's as hard to kill as a cockroach.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

I do not know what made me happier, the text in the preview or the cards.

Golden times for LOTR LCG,

I LIKE they want to change the fact, that every cycle develops only 1 faction.

I REALLY LIKE return to secrecy.

I LOVE the cards!

But there will be one another change, I can see 3 tactics cards, all with Ring-Maker cycle symbol and with numbers under 20, so they all are from this AP.

Silvan Refugee, at 1 cost, will be the perfect candidate to activate those bouncing out of play effects. With Celeborn in play, a one turn questing of 3 willpower is worthwhile as well. And although you will be taking some Silvan allies out of play, I doubt that you'll be completely wiping the board of allies each turn (especially the expensive ones), so I think Silvan Tracker will still have a place,

I don't know about you guys, but Caleb, Matthew and FFG in general know how to create spectation. And it was well delivered.

 

I love also, and that's my opinion, the caring and love these two guys are putting on theme, to the point of making each known trait on this game unique to play. That's something that makes me want to play each and every type of deck.

 

The mechanics, interesting. The art, you know, we need to create a new adjective for excellency, like LOTR-esque art, because saying it's beautiful sounds shallow.

amazing Art work, Silvan reinforcements, promises of more secrecy & mount stuff... WOW!!!

 

Mono Lore just got that much more interesting to me... Elrond, Milronde + ???. Recycling 'The Tree People' with 'Isildur's Scroll' AND 'Vilya' (that also gives a spirit icon) AND Elrond's ability to pay for other sphere allies... making it very easy to include Silvan Refugee, stargazer, childen of the sea etc... (Celeborn in a 2nd deck probably with S'Glorfindel & Legolas).

 

Stocks in Prince Imrahil, Eomer, Horn of Gondor, Valiant sacrifice & Children of the sea must be going up too. Maybe even Rivendell Bow as a to boost Rúmil's response.

 

I'm guessing from the wording of Rúmil's response "After you play from your hand... " means that neither Vilya Nor The Tree People would trigger his response... pity... oh well.... Horn of Gondor attached to Legolas would make paying for him pretty simple.

Silvan Tracker and Mirlonde are the backbone of every elf deck. Once tow of these guys are out you have almost nothing to fear. Especially when entering the Druadan Forest.

Yes, I already liked Mirlonde quite a bit for her role in mono-Lore decks.  (In fact, she is the only FFG "made-up" hero that I do consistently use... Some of the others aren't necessarily bad, I just have a hard time using them over real Tolkien characters.)  Anyways, Mirlonde will undoubtedly see much more use now with the Silvan trait being developed.  

 

I really enjoy the thematic direction they're taking with the Silvan trait as well.  Powerful play-entering abilities but short lived... Just brilliant for the Elves of Middle-earth whose presence there in the Third Age is slowly fading.

That "White Council" card looks interesting. Each player chooses a different option, them being ready a hero you control, what looks like add one resource to a hero you control, and two more options I can't quite make out. That would make for some interesting decisions in a four player game.

## 65 [Gizlivadi on January 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=949654)

About the White Council: I think it should be more than just add one resource or else in solo play (yes I get that the card was intended more for multiplayer but it still should work for solo, hence the X cost) it would be a pretty crappy effect. Love the theme of it though, and the art.

I totally agree with the first and disagree with the second point: I really like Mirlonde and think she belongs to every mono-Lore deck, but for that I would not play her with Celeborn, especially as he (just by himself) benefits allies, not heroes.

 

And if Silvan Tracker was good with Mirlonde, he will be better with Celeborn, of course (though they don't match in sphere).

But it shall be one resource, surely, unless I am much mistaken. Because if it were two resources (for one paid), the card would be too strong in comparison to the likes of Wealth of Gondor or Gaining Strength - all the more so being neutral. If it is one resource, it can still be played solo - in order to shift the resource, but the other options will of course be more likely benefitting. And as said, it is made for coop.

Yes, I realized that (and actually proxy-tried) that also. I too have desired to use Mirkwood Runner more, and this is a good option. But actually, the card is not too bad on its own. I guess, however, that we shall see some Galadhrim weapons (surely the bow) in the near future, so that further boost will be possible.

To the "White Council" card: The 1st option is surely "Ready 1 hero you control", 2nd is "add 1 resource to a hero you control". I cant see the 3rd option, but there is a word "from" :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Like everyone else, I am very excited about this, and as a Noldor/Silvan player, I simply cannot wait.

 

One question, since I haven't been keeping up very well lately: Is this "Ringmaker cycle" (kickass name, I want to see Celebrimbor!) connected to the Voice of Isengard expansion like Khazad-Dûm/Dwarrowdelf and Heirs of Númenor/Against the Shadow, or is VoI a standalone addition?

 

I have been hoping for an elven cycle for quite a while now, even though I thought it was Rohan's time to shine. With Celeborn in the first AP, we may very well see lady Galadriel later on - with Nenya, hopefully! If she is a hero, I'm guessing that she will be [spirit] and able to predict the player or encounter deck ("things that have not yet come to pass"). What do you guys think? If she is powerful, her threat level may even match or surpass Elrond's.

 

Thanks for the info. This made my day so much better!

The newest article states that this cycle takes place directly following the events of Voice of Isengard, so I think it will be more connected to this next cycle than any of the deluxe expansions before it were.

Note that the focus of the cycle is not elves, as it doesn't have any real focus at all. It will present sprinkles of factions and cultures from all of middle earth, and in fact I think that after the Dunland Trap elves will receive little attention. Hopefully we'll get more artifact and ring cards like Nenya or the Elendilmir (which was found by Saruman and kept in Orthanc, so it feels appropiate). I think we'll see Galadriel in the next saga expansion rather than in the cycle, but of course I could be wrong.

I think none of this cards belong to the first AP...

The Encounter-Cards don't have the same symbol and the card-numbers of the Player-Cards are to high (first number can't be a 1, if you ask me)

You're right. Those numbers should all be single-digit numbers. I hate it when they do that! They did the same thing when they announced The Steward's Fear. They talk a bit about the pack, then move on to talking about the cycle and that's when they send in a picture featuring cards from throughout the cycle, just to tease you even more.

 

Well, as long as they don't do what they did for the AtS cycle: reveal the first pack in October 2012, release it in May 2013. Seven months is a ridiculous wait in this game.

> 
> What do you think?

I think it would definitely be cool if the eagles expanded out of the Tactics sphere.  In my opinion, Spirit seems like a good fit for them.  In The Hobbit, the eagles save the day by rescuing the Company of Thorin from the wild wargs and then proceed to fly them to safety.  Eagles already bolster some serious attack power with their presence in Tactics; so now I'd like to see them represented more as saviors (Landroval [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/51223bd0-ffd1-11df-a976-0801203c9004]already has a great hero saving ability; more effects like his is what I'm thinking.)  Perhaps location management could be a new eagle role as well since they are capable of flying great distances.  These are just a few ideas I have, but in reality it might make eagles too powerful.  Even where they stand now, though, I greatly enjoy making eagle decks, but they more or less serve one role since they're only present in the Tactics sphere.  

 

And straying a little off topic here (but still on the note of birds of MIddle-earth,) I was really bummed that the On the Doorstep Saga Expansion did not include an ally card of Roac the Raven [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Ro%C3%A4c], who aids the Company of Thorin in the novel.  Though we did get the Ravens of the Mountain [http://hallofbeorn.com/HallOfBeorn_deploy/Cards/Search?Query=ravens&CardType=None&CardSet=Any&Trait=Any&Keyword=Any&Cost=-1&Sphere=None&Unique=False&Sort=None] Lore card, we didn't get the old bird himself, so I'd love to see him pop up somewhere even if it is exceedingly unlikely now!  I'm a bit partial to birds, though, so I'd be happy to see any new ones show up in the game... and yes, even the deadly Craven Eagle [http://hallofbeorn.com/HallOfBeorn_deploy/Cards/Details/fd89bdbf-7475-4f3e-96fc-8f5315a93074]!

Yeah, the lower bunch of cards are most likely from future expansions: just the same happened with the Steward's Fear announcement. It is probably because they merged the cycle and first pack announcements together (we used to get both in the past for Dwarrodelf, for instance).

Did not notice the numbers, thanks for pointing it out, I was fully expecting to see all those cards when i got the pack, a little disappointed, but at least whole pack is not spoiled.

The White Council indeed gets stronger the more players are around the table.

Yet the cost increases 1 per player, making it quite expensive with 3 - 4 players, 

as the difference between 2 to 4 cost is huge in this game.

 

Though it already feels like a very strong utility card, like Gandalf himself & Miruvor with many options on them.

And the best part is that it's neutral, so it's always usable.

 

Somehow this card themeaticly feels very spirit-sphere to me, but neutral is even better playability wise.

I'm going to put it into a mono tactics solo deck, which needs some readying effects after the quest phase.

Yea, readying effects are always useful and we need more of them outside of Spirit. Rohan Warhorse was a nice addition, but being restricted makes it painful to use because you lose the ability to hold another weapon. When playing solo, I like to reword the cards to say "Limit one mount attachment per character" and remove the other limitations (except for ones like "Attach to a tactics or Rohan hero" obviously).

I just read it again (it is so beautiful, haha :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] ) and saw things I overlooked before:

The Dunland Trap also provides more support for the Mount trait, as well as the Time X and Doomed X mechanics featured in The Voice of Isengard, and players will also discover thematic ties to Saruman and the White Council.

 
More support for the Mount trait. Will we only see Mounts, or even allies or events working with them? I would really like the latter option. 
 
 
And another thing-  "...players will also discover thematic ties to Saruman..". WHAT IS THIS? I have not got any ideas. But maybe...Palantiri ?! Or what? Please share your thoughts.

As I've said a million times, and I won't get tired of it, maybe Palantiri, magic rings, other wizards, and the White Council (we already saw the card). And mostly, more magic and spells!!

look like the eagle deck will be making a comeback. Things like Born Aloft  suddenly look playable...

I expect more to come... still I think a Eagle Deck might be on the comeback trail.

 

Some card coming to mind are also..

Looks like this might even get into the initial draft of a deck design...

Bouncing is always a really fun thing in card game, something I really like. I expect this will form some VERY strong decks. When you consider there will be a full cycle adding to this effect and all the threat reduction I expect may come along with the new DOOMed keyword...

 

I dunno.. looks like some power decks are a coming.

I would like player cards with Time mechanic. Maybe with Ents... "While this super-strong Ent has Time token on it, he can't exhaust"

## 93 [booored on January 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=958236)

There is a effect called "fated" in COC, were it is "Fated: X"... each time you activate the action or response or w/e it gets a token.. after X tokens you place it at the bottom of your deck. Pretty cool, and kind of similar to what you mean. Allows very powerful card to come and go... I think it could find a home in LoTR.

## 94 [Scroll Lock on January 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96476-another-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=958246)

Yes, that mechanic fits into this game.
