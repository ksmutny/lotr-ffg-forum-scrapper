My husband and I received the Core Set for Christmas this year. His birthday is coming up and I wanted to buy him an expansion pack and/or an adventure pack or two.

I need some help though. There are so many to choose from: what order do we need to get them in? What one should I buy first, second, third?

 

Please help! Thank you!

Well the first cycle released was 'The Shadows of Mirkwood'. Starts with 'The Hunt for Gollum', you can just check the product list to see the following packs (6 in a cycle).

 

 There is also the deluxe expansion 'Khazad-Dhum', this will give you 3 new missions and a fair few player cards. It also includes cards to support the 'Darrowdelf' cycle (the one currently being released). There is no point buying darrowdelf packs until you have khazad dhum!

 

 I personally always buy in order, so I would suggest starting from what was first released! Personal choice though, im sure people will tell you which packs have the best cards etc (I just prefer to have everything!)

It makes sense to do it in order anyways, Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, etc. I would recommend some packs to skip for their quests being not as interesting as others but they all have valuable player cards.

I would get them for him in order too.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Start with Hunt for Gollum and then Conflict at the Carrock, so forth and so on.

 Same opinion here ! :-) Granted, some missions aren't as fun as others..in fact, some are sort of a chore (Hills of Emyn Muil)...but as it was said before, the new Hero and player cards are too good to pass up. Beside, since each cycle tells a story, it's cooler to play them in sequence...In fact me and my girlfriend never progressed beyond a quest unless we beat it once. Gives a nice feeling of progression !

After the Core Set, the Mirkwood cycle came out in this order:

1. Hunt for Gollum

2. Conflict at Carrock

3. Journey to Rhosgobel

4. Hills of Emyn Muil

5. Dead Marshes

6. Return to Mirkwood.

 

Then

7. Khazad-Dum Deluxe expansion


Dwarrowdelf Cycle:

1. Redhorn Gate

2. Road to Rivendell

 

I agree with the other guys that you should get them in order. Khazad-dum will be way too hard if you jump to it without getting the preceeding player cards.

He's going to be really excited, way to go!
