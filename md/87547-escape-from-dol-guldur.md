So do you draw your hand of 6 cards first or do you put down all the guarded cards for the objectives? 

 

Thanks,

For all scenarios you always draw your six cards, then set scenario cards and follow setup instructions

So for Dol Guldur you might not be able to play cards in your hand for a particular hero if they are captured.
