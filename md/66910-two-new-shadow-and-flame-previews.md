Both preview cards look pretty sweet!

Only real problem I have with them is that once again these two sweet cards are Spirit and Lore spheres… ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Yes, and Miruvor, the Spirit one (surprise), is very strong, I feel, especially in a deck with Beravor. I can just imagine what Tactics will get…

Hey, tactics still needs more sh*tty cards to make those two never-exhausting allies work. After all, it makes your decision much easier to discard a card when it's not useful or (too expensive) anyway.

Best combo ever: Fetch Miruvor to get 1 resource and put it on the top of the deck!

you do get to choose 2 though- so you get 1 effect and a reuse for free

 Finally a way to get all your cards in one turn with the help of Beravor and Miruvor……

How does one Refresh Beravor, add one resource token to Beravor(techinally a spirit hero but it she has a song then it would still count) and put this card on top of their deck in a single round.

If she already had a couple tokens one her you still only be drawing one extra card with her ability because 1 of the two would be Miruor. Unless she has like 40+ tokens on her I can't see her drawing her entire deck.

I can predict the new tactics cards: A card that gives attack and an ally with no willpower and boring mechanics! cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

I am one of those who loves Spirit and Lore…I know, how "typical." Miruvor is just jaw-dropping gorgeous!  Wow.

Expensive, but possible. Cool card, otherwise.

 

Let me say this, before Glaurung can do:

Errata for Beravor:

use power only once per turn!

I havd't been using the Ranger for a while because I'd found the ever-drawing proccess a bit boring, and tried to supplement her with other ways. Now that I came back to Beravor, she seems by far the safest bet to draw them.

She actually suplanted Strider in the deck and as much as I like his ability and synergies, the deck works much better now because it can draw from the start. That is a huge difference compared even to the strongest drawing cards like Mathom.

Now for the errata, Beravor is a strong hero in her stats, so I don't think she would go to waste if she could only draw once per round. With the Protector, she makes a great quester/blocker (more so with the Brand).

…and as Rich mentioned, the art for the craftsman is just terrible. I mean the Elf really looks like anything but.

Yes, yes. It was. haha

I just didn't understood your reply.
You can't get 1 effect + reuse + free. It costs 1 resource to play.
