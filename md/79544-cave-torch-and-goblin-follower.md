Since Cave Torch says to discard the card, and then if it is an enemy add it to the staging area, Goblin Follower's "When Revealed" effect would not take place, right?  I just wanted to make sure I'm not doing anything wrong.

Thanks

I think you are correct.  Reveal is used in a specific way.  A card can be "added" to the staging area without having "revealed" it, so the When Revealed effect does not trigger.

Thanks for the reply.  I think it's kind of like Sneak Attack in Escape from Dul Guldur, as you are not "playing" the character, but "putting it into play", and in this case you are "adding" the card to the staging area, not "revealing" it.
