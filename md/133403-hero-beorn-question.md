Hi all, just a silly quick question: is hero Beorn able to be put back into play via Landroval's response? I really hope he is, as I'm taking on a 3-player Journey down the Anduin tomorrow with mono-tactics and unless i can draw a Gondorian Shield for Beregond in setup or mulligan, then Beorn will have to eat a hit from the Hill Troll on turn one due to my starting threat of 33. Any help would be much appreciated!! Cheers from Australia!!

I suppose i should qualify the question by giving my understanding of it = even though Beorn has 'immune to player card effects' does that still void landrovals responce given that Beorn is considered out of play when the response takes place?

Again, it might sound like a silly question, but any help would be great! Cheers

Yes, as he is out of play when Landroval's response trigger, is text is not active.
