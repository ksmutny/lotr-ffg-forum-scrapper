Hi,

In the rules on explanation of victory points there is:

"Some enemy and location cards award victory points
when they are defeated. When such a card leaves play,
one player should place it near his threat dial to remind
the players of the victory points when they are scoring
at the end of the game."

I was wondering what happens if the encounter deck is depleted and we need to re-shuffle it. Is the card returned to the deck or not?

Once you have defeated a victory card, it stays next to your threat dial for the remainder of the game. It is not shuffled back in even if the encounter deck is re-shuffled.
