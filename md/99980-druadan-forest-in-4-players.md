Has anyone played this quest (Druadan Forest) in 4 players?

 

It is really dificult, woses hit us a lot, but... A LOT!!! Even in my identity card...

 

Before:

After:

It is a joke, of course. But seriously: some rounds with 30 archery..., always without resources (4 cards revealed and almost all of the cards with prowl, locations that make impossible the life...)

It is true that 2 of the players were new players, but the other 2 were very good players. We played 3 times , and all the 3 with an absolutelly loss.

Maybe we must build specific decks.

 

 

How about the others? Have you tried it in 4 players?

> Each deck 3 war del of healing and you done

that's absurd - this quest is not that simple.

 

to the OP: yes, this quest gets more and more difficult the more players you add. 30 archery and tons of threat is par for the course for this quest during multiplayer - and not being able to pay for things becomes more difficult.

Played it with 4 players when it first came out. All we could do was laugh on every first or second round loss.

I just tried it again solo last night. It demolished outlands, that archery just kept killing them off before I gained any momentum. I think everybody has to be able to kill them the turn they appear or else you are SOL. I was playing archery originally as only while in the staging area, on reread, I found out it is much worse.

I played it with 4/3 players too - and we only survive to stage 2 - archery and prowl its killing and nasty  combo. We fall like flies and without resources, we could only watch the deaths of our characters, one by one. For 4 players is it  the most difficult scenario.

haha, it's going to be really, really tough. so much archery. such high threat on locations. healing is a must. resource acceleration is helpful.

So everyone stock up on healers like Glaurung said basically.

I'll play Elrond, that's a no-brainer.

How about a low cost card strategy?

Combined with a ranged attack / attack-the-staging-area strategy a la legolas + hands on the bow?

Its good  when one  player  play Elrond, Eleanora: 

 

Elrond + Vilya - You can play cards even when you do not have the resources. 

Eleanora - to cancel Treachery cards. 

For this, all available for  heals cards. 

Thror's Key - for more nasty locations. 

Northern Tracker. 

Legolas, Bard The Bowman + Hands Upon The Bow - killing enemy with archery before they will engage with you. 

Hama, Bokk Of Eldacar - to take back Hands Upon The Bow

yes, but that's not anywhere near close enough - especially if you don't draw them.

 

locations are often going to have 10+ threat (it's based on the archery total, which is often very high in multiplayer). so, you'll need a way to deal with that, if you can't quest through it.

 

archery has to be placed on allies on one stage, which means the healers might get wiped out early/often.

 

it's just such, such a tough quest, in general, for multiplayer and i'm not sure any one strategy is a consistent win.

Perhaps something strong to drink? ...I so so hate the prowl! 3 or 4 player DF sounds like a cruel and unusual way to spend an evening. I'm a fan of Silvan Trackers & Asfaloth for this quest,  if you have enough resources to get them into play.

 

Good luck.

yes Dain Ironfoot have right. This cards, which I wrote, can little help survive longer , but  for now,  this is still the nightmare quest for 4 players.

I agree with Dain Ironfoot. Playing the two players, and for four players is a big difference. 
Besides, only the player who plays Elrond may play a card without resources. rest of the players without resources get stuck with cards on his hands. 
So as I said - these tips may help a little, but still I could not ever get further than the stage 2. In addition, 4 cards are revealed every turn + sometimes surge - that afflict players mercilessly by all ways. And even with 3x Warden Of The Healing does not keep up to heal the wounds in 12 Heroes + Allies , and Archery,  put on characters many wounds ,every turn. For 4 players is it a brutal quest.

Seems we're not playing this week as one of the guys fell sick.

Thanks for the tips though. There's always next week.

I'll let you guys know how it went.

For 4 players for this quest even Easy mode does not help (I tried) - Encounter Deck is very small, and for four players scrolls quickly, so you  must often it shuffles, and enemies barely kill them, come back again. does not have a moment's peace.

When it is in play, it becomes impossible to play nothing:

 

ffg_ancestral-clearing-tdf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_ancestral-clearing-tdf.jpg]

 

If you dont have asfaloth and 1 tracker, impossible to play cards getting stronger player.

 

But the worst, this fatal combo:

 

ffg_glade-of-cleansing-tdf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_glade-of-cleansing-tdf.jpg]   ffg_druadan-hunter-tdf.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_druadan-hunter-tdf.jpg]

 

At the end of the round, you probably dont have any resource (or a very fews), so the threat of location raise up to ... 13!

And the archery of the hunter is... of course: 13.

It is easy that in staging could be 2 copies of one of them... so, probably: game over in 2 rounds.

 

You must play very very well your cards to avoid that combos. I am seeing that the real combat here is in staging, so you need cards that manipulate locations from staging (Asfaloth, trackers), and combat enemies from staging (trackers-bow, hands upon the bow, hail of stones...). Locations are more easy if you reach to play the player cards, enemies is more dificult because when you need trigger the event you dont have resources (and trackers-bows are slow to play all they).

If you have Voice of Isengard, I would bring along Legacy of Numenor and maybe Saruman.  Precious resources for all your heroes and the ability to exile a nasty location/enemy for a turn.  I think this is one quest where everyone at the table can stomach four threat for the resources.

Yeah, it's hard to feel bad for the heroes here. Stomping through ancestral clearings, killing poor Woses who are just trying to have a drum circle...

ah yes, itchiness, thanks again for all the help. Appreciated. You would be pleased to know that this had an immediate effect on all involved, the itchiness stopping remarkably quickly. Then the forest was a very peaceful place indeed, bodies lying quietly in their own little pools of red... except of course for the multitude of BUZZING FLIES helping to decompose the now itch free bodies... if, of course, they weren't stolen as well!! Do hope that the Wose enjoy the peaceful negotiations with bathing corpses...

Aaaaaagh, finally! We won!!!!

 

zxzr.jpg [http://imageshack.com/a/img836/4162/zxzr.jpg]

 

But we suffer during all the game until the end. Very funny.

 

We played very well, maybe the attacker player (monsophere tactics) not had good cards in hand. But other player (monolore deck) had good work healing, and the other 2 players (monosphere spirit) could play lots of cancels and one tracker, and me (no monolore.... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]) could quest hard and play asfaloth.

We had problems with enemies, they weren't killed from staging (no hails of stones, etc., only Thalin the first rounds -after was killed-, and one tracker-bow after, but not enough to kill nobody from staging), i could play arwen and become one centinel to defend, any chump blocker, and aragorn (just last round died - oooooooh - by Wose boss).

 

Values: 241 score in 8 rounds (O.O, but without killing nobody from staging).

Well done! I really want to play this quest 4 player now as it sounds like a completely different experience. I don't think I've actually ever lost this quest but I play two handed (have lost one of the two players a few times however) and four player this looks to be absolutely punishing! That druadan hunter and glade of cleansing combo you showed is bad enough against two players but against 4 with archery 13 and 13 threat....... :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] !

So we did this quest yesterday and I warned my buddies about it screaming fire & brimstone.

And you know what? It was actually not that bad.

We won on our second try, with rather a feel of control from stage 2 and onward.

1st try we played blindly, as always, and died the first round questing as 1 of the guys threat-out after all our characters where removed from the quest by a treachery. Ok, so we all took 2 questers each next game every round.

Maybe we got lucky, but the 2nd try went fine.

I was the only guy who had build a deck for it, as the others where too lazy, and used their decks from stewards fear.

And I must say, I was not the star of the show.

The mono spirit quest canon guy smashed through most of stage 3b with his willpower attacking.

I did not manage to get a single healer on the table. Prowl sucks.

Yet we could usually pull out, and kill off the woses each turn.

Fun quest really. We all agreed. Though prowl does suck...

Drúadan Forest and Assault on Osgiliath are my favourite quests now, probably not only out of Against the Shadow cycle.

 

But I almost always play two people, so the Forest is challenging but not as crazy as with four. There is an important aspect, threat really does not matter here, no Doomed and you want to engage the Woses anyway. So yes, the new Doomed cards seem especially fit, as do high starting threat decks that can deal with stuff. Also, Denethor has been the champion of the quest for me, especially in combination with Strider's Path (for nasty locations) and Expecting Mischief (killing immediately the Thief, and getting rid of his surge, and the Drummer, reducing the threat considerably; which is half of the enemies you will get). Direct Damage is great in general: the enemies have low hit points.

 

So if I had to make four decks, I would do this:

Lore Rangers with Denethor and healing; Gildor's Counsel is also a great card, as every encounter can lead to accumulating trouble.

Tactics direct damage deck, preferably with Thalin, even Beorning Beekeeper can be a winner then.

Very high questing deck, going all out willpower, it will be needed.

Global card draw deck, to engine the rest, Deep Knowledge on repeat with Scroll of Isildur, for instance.

With heavy heart, I am inclined to agree that the play-testing must have been very poor for the cycle. I really do not want to sound ungrateful as I totally love the game but I cannot imagine taking two of the Second Breakfast decks (though I, again, like the entries very much) and have a decent chance against some of the quests here. And whether I am a talented player or not, I have been spending a lot of time on the game these past three years, so I should have enough experience in its execution.

I do have high hopes the Ring-maker cycle will be much better in this regard, though.

you can see my video in youtube.... so you know how I play. I pretty sure wirh Elrond Glorifindel lore and 4 W of healing I will make it....

most of the players create problems where is no problem.

Foelr example..... if you are good player and your partner too but third player is moron and have a bad deck you wil lose a game. But us doesn't mean by 3 players is impossible..... hope you got what I mean......

But I think the question was, have you actually tried Drúadan Forest with 4 players -- regardless how many people were at the table? I haven't. I guess it must be cruelly difficult since already 2-player game is often very challenging and the scaling is just bad in favour of solo play. I think this is where many nay-saying about the quest comes from. Also, if one finds his skills superior, why trying to take the mechanically best deck to beat a quest?

With a few notable exceptions, I usually am the moron at our table.

Yet we rarely lose a game.

I have Elrind and Glorfindel as the basis of one of the 4 decks

You don't actually get much of a chance to play allies Glaurung

It's all over very quickly

Same goes for Into Ithilien 4 Player

Just craziness

Do you remember you yourself once talked about playing a 4 player game and you were astounded at how the synergies of the encounter cards could just pile on and defeat you ?

This is that x 10

However. I can totally see that these quests play very differently in solo

You have a lot more control and not as many encounter deck effects to deal with

It is obvious that quests like Drúadan Forest have encounter sets that combo wonderfully. I can already see a very great difference between solo and 2-player.

 

Troymk, if you are still interested to keep trying it out, consider my advice above. I am not saying you will pull a win, but I am interested if it can be at least an improvement. Scouting the encounter deck can help, direct damage in combination with it, crazy willpower provided by one of the four (plus some decent willpower heroes in some of the others), and perhaps warden of healing somewhere as well. I think Legolas or someone for Hands Upon the Bow, and Hail of Stones are great to cut the Hunter before his archery is applied. I do not have much time for it now, but if you cannot, I might have to do it myself.

Yes sure i remember and i already check Druadan Encounter deck and I'm pretty sure i can make it with Combo i use to explain already….. You can put allies into play as well not only you need to play them all the time……Sure is not easy anyway….. But heal  is a key and put allies also is  and use all your resources every round….. But there is some nasty cards like a locations (no gain resources) can lock you……….. 

 

And remember the time when i make Leadership/lore deck and won all almost all quest without any problem. But this time majority on this forum was sure you cannot make a successful  deck without spirit and Test of will….. That why i start to make my video to show people is possible…….

Anyway i don't have any chance to play 4 players since in Bangkok we don't have some many players……we lucky when we can play by 3…… maybe octgn? But i have a mac so also no chance…….

Glaurung  If you have the room you can do it yourself.  To tinker my decks to being ready to hand to people, I play 4 Player Solo. Take up the dining room table  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Come on glaurung, stop boasting as if you have just discovered universe. You keep saying you were the first one crying about Beravor and Protector of Lórien, even implying the errata might have come because of you. Now you are suddenly the first one having been able to win without Spirit. I am not saying you cannot play the game, you should just realize there are probably hundreds, maybe thousands of people capable of it. Also when you say this is the only serious way to play the game it  is just, you know, your opinion. I am not to wreak havoc here, I am just saying there are always many different perspectives and one should tolerate those also that are not necessarily his own.

I'm doing a 4 player quest through all 9 HoN & AtS Cycle.  I remembered how hard this was and set it up in easy mode.

 

So,....

 

After being stripped relentlessly of all their resources Stars in Sky popped out and retracted everyone from the quest. + 23 Threat  Game over Turn 1

 

(To add insult to injury each Hero had taken 2 damage already from Men in Dark x2)

 

 

I will give this one more try but it looks laughably unbalanced as we've discussed.

Tried this one YET again last night.

 

My guys quested for 21 and kept almost all their resources (and I had 2 A Test of Wills in hand) (and Gandalf Destroyed a Druadan Elite as he sneaked in for the quest)

 

However after some prowls removed 9-11 resources I was bereft. Between the locations and enemies revealed the Druadan were at 36 Threat, and 34 archery.

 

I resigned.

 

If FFG DO read these, Guys let me playtest 4 player for you   MY GOD  you need someone to!!!!!
