Had my first real game tonight it was fantastic, a really good story experience really enjoyed it, but I have some questions.

1. I was playing passage through Mirkwood and Denether got webbed meaning I had to pay to refresh him. I had already played all of the allies whose name escapes me that let me remove the condition (treachery) so there was no means in my mind of removing this card. A number of turns later the same thing happened I drew the same card, now here is the question, could I have webbed him twice meaning if I wasn't paying, he just still didn't refresh but would require double to refresh and would need twice the means to remove the webbing if I hadn't already paid them or do I have to web another Hero?

2. If I am progressing a quest card or location and finish it off, say I have two left and I have three progress to put down do I transfer it to the next quest card?

3. Not really a rules question, does the game transform much from the base set? Is always so high quality?

4. Can I play all the allies in my deck? Is it normal to have 8 allies at the end of the quest?

cheers in advance, sorry for the newbie lingo

Hi and welcome to the game and community!

 

1) Caught in a Web is addressed in the official FAQ, which you can find here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LotR-FAQ.pdf [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LotR-FAQ.pdf]

 

The relevant portion is this:

 

Q: How does a player resolve the situation in which a single hero has multiple copies of Caught in a Web (CORE 80) attached?
A: The player must pay for each copy of Caught in a Web before the hero can ready. Each copy of the card creates an independent condition that must be fulfilled before readying the attached hero, so if each condition is not fulfilled the hero cannot ready. End result, if a hero has two copies of Caught in a Web attached, the player will have to pay 4 resources from that hero’s resource pool in order to ready the card.
 
2) Progress tokens do not carry over from one quest card to the next-- that extra progress is just lost.
 
3) In my opinion the quality has stayed very high throughout the game's life.  The Saga expansions (the two Hobbit-themed expansions and the Fellowship of the Ring "The Black Riders" expansion) in particular are some of the best quests in the game, and the developers continue to release player cards in those expansions that you'll want to buy as well.  
 
4) There's no restriction on how many cards you can have down on the table, so yeah it's normal to have a host of allies at your command by the game's end, if you've done well.  Just watch that you don't have more than 1 copy of a Unique character (like Gandalf) on the table at any one time.
