All the player cards and some quest details have been revealed in the "what to expect from the assault on osgiliath thread" the later pages are mostly discussion on them with I think most of the spoilers being on page 4 or so

Edit: make that page 5

I think you could have put up a spoiler notice and save the content for inside the post (instead of the subject).

you also can see there is a link to all cards (without picture) on German language.

Are you similarly disappointed when FFG reveals the hero(s) for a pack/box or do you not read the articles to avoid "spoilers". Not bring sarcastic honestly asking.

No, I expect FFG posts to contain some reveals/spoilers (including heroes about half of the time) in additon to new mechanics, plot details, etc. but they don't paint a full picture. Although I figured we'd get the Faramir hero, I didn't know, and I like to avoid such content (particularly big cards like heroes) until I pick up the pack (which would be a while since I'm still catching up). I know I could have avoided the forum, and even hesitated coming here because of spoilers, but getting it in the subject line (something FFG doesn't do, at least not explicitly like "Faramir is the new hero...") seems too much.

 

Generally I appreciate what Devastatione88 posts, I just think that a "spoiler alert" (to avert one's eyes) is a common courtesy at this stage of forum, blog, internet development.

Except that Faramir being a hero in this cycle was an open secret. Otherwise I agree about spoilers being neccessary.

I would disagree, we all (I think) hoped it would happen, but at least I (I can't have been the only one) was prepared for disappointment after seeing a minor character (Hirluin) and then a made up one (Mirlonde) in the first 2 boxes.

I'm sorry if I spoiled Faramir for you John85. I should have spoiler-alerted. My bad. Really sorry.
