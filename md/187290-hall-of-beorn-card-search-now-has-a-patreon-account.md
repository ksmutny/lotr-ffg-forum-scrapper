As the game grows in popularity, the Hall of Beorn Card Search is receiving more visitors every month. It is great for the game, and it is exciting to see the community around the game grow and mature. This also comes with a cost. Specifically, it costs money to host the search engine. I have started a Patreon account to help cover the hosting costs of the site. If you find the search engine useful, all that I ask is for $1 a month. This helps me to keep content up to date and continue adding new features. Thanks for your support!

Tried to, but my attempt was blocked cause Greece is under financial capital control and we cannot make payments abroad. Tried in case I was lucky but ... Hope it will be lifted soon

Dan, if you feel up to it, make a post about the increase in traffic your search engine recieves. It'd be cool to read about the stats and maybe it would finally shut up the "ded gaem" crowd.

Where is that "dead game" crowd you keep talking about? People are bringing that up, but I do not actually see anybody who tries to actually prove that game is dead, or at least insists on it.

Yes, I will have to dig up the traffic stats. While it is hard to correlate an increase in traffic on the search engine with a direct increase in players of the game, this is certainly the most logical conclusion. I can say that traffic on the search engine seems to be up 10-25% since just before Gen Con and almost 30% since the beginning of the year.

It seems to have finally been put to bed, but it used to be that every month or so, someone would post a "omg, the game is dying!" thread.
