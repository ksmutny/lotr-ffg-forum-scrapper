Notice that The Lord of the Rings LCG was nominated as best game of the year as well as best artwork by Dice Tower Games?  This is a high honor indeed!

That is pretty amazing! I absolutely love the artwork in this game, especially the location cards. Simply stunning art on those.

 Yup ! All the more reason to sleeve the Encounter cards as well as the player cards…real top notch art ! And this nomination is highly deserved…ever since my girlfriend gave me this game, it not only made me an avid player of the game, but made me fall back in love all over again with Tolkien's work. In fact, the use they make of the whole setting, geography and history is simply awesome. Good work FFG !

 I agree! I love this LCG. I tend to be really competitive when it comes to card games, and this is a nice way to get together with friends and play cards, without the feeling of their being a winner and a loser; even when we lose, the game is fun and exciting. I enjoy the difficult quests, actually. Getting really close but not quite making it is intense, and makes me want to shuffle-up and try again!

Same here…I love CCGs, but they get so competitive that if you don't win a couple of games, you feel like your evening has been a waste. It's especially hard to take when you spent hours and hours building a deck. At least in LOTR, the LCG, you play with others, and you can actually build synergies together. It has the dynamic of a CCG without the bad vibe you get from its competitive visage.

I got to say that The_Fallen_Arises helped me discover a bunch of fabulous games from the ffg range and I have never ever regretted it. 

As a matter of fact, I'm looking foward to own shares of that company since everything they touch is gold : awesome art, cooperative play, great franchises, loyal customers, etc.

I may have said it couple of times today during the game I and The_Fallen opened the Doors of Durin, but LOTR lcg is the best.

No wonder it may win more than one award.
