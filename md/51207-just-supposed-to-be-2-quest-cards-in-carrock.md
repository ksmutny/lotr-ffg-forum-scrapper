 Unlike the other four quests we have encountered so far, the stage 2 of this quest doesn't actually state that players win the game after defeating the trolls.  Am I missing a quest card or something, or is defeating the trolls the end of the quest?

 no one knows "for sure" but we've all gotten only 2 quest cards.

since the point of the quest is to kill the trolls, it seems logical to assume that it only has the 2.

Defeating the trolls and putting 1 progress token on quest 2B is enough to win the game.

 Yeah; that's what I thought too guys.  Thanks for the prompt comments! So; what set are we to receive this Radagast card that I have seen on lotrlcg.com?

 In the Journey to Rosgobel pack, which is next.  I'm excited to get Radagast, but I do hope the new creature cards in the JtR pack have more than 1 hp, because his healing power doesn't help the Winged Gaurdians.

 While I was at GenCon, I asked on of the game designers who was there demoing the game. He said the scenario is 2 quest cards; once you complete the second card, you win the game.

Good, can we expect the cards of Massing At Osgiliath to appear at lotrlcg.com soon then? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
