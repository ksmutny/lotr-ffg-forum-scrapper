I am trying The Redhorn Gate today.  I am on 3B of the quest, with Caradhras being the active location.  I reveal Fell Voices (TRG 2/29) which reads:
"When Revealed: Return the top 2 Snow cards in the encounter discard pile to the top of the encounter deck…"

In the encounter discard pile, the topmost snow card is a Snow Warg (TRG 29/29) and the next one is Avalanche! (TRG 21/29).  My question is do I have to put the topmost one (i.e. Snow Warg) on the encounter deck first and then Avalanche! on its top (i.e. next card I reveal from the encounter deck will be Avalanche!), or I can take these two cards out from the discard pile and rearrange their order to be put on the encounter deck?

In this game, I use the first approach and then Avalanche! (in cooperation with 3B quest card) would kill all but two of my characters on board.  I am relying on Dain Ironfoot to give everyone (but Arwen) +1 boost to willpower.  Since Avalanche! would exhaust Dain and commit him to quest, everyone would loose that boost, plus the effect of Caradhras which -1 willpower to all who commits to quest, all drawf with printed willpower of 1 (including Dain himself) would be dead due to the effect of quest 3B.  Even I have a Lure of Moria that I can pay for (to ready all Drawf characters) would not save me, right?  Because before I can take an action, Dain will be exhausted and his boost is lost.  Avalanche! could be brutal in stage 3.

i remember this being asked when it came out, and i believe (though am not certain) that you can choose what order you put them back on the deck

….but now i think about it, returning them in their natural order would make more sense….so sorry, im not sure!

 My first thought is that this is similar to "simultaneous effects."  From the official FAQ:

"(1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing
If two or more conflicting effects would occur simultaneously, the first player decides the order in which the effects resolve."

This is only one effect, really, but as there are no other guidelines available that I'm aware of, I would say you can choose the order.

I've received the reply from Caleb Grace,

Hi Angus,
Because Fell Voices does not specify the order in which you return the 2 cards to the top of the encounter deck, then the first player will decide.
Cheers,
Caleb

Thanks Caleb for clarifying this!

Hi All,

Similar question to Angus…. If I only have one snow card to return from the encounter discard pile to the top of the encounter deck, then fell voices gains surge. In this case which comes first, the surge or returning the card? Because if it is returning the card first, then the surge will put it straight into play, which is how I have been playing it. However, I am not entirely sure that it has been played correctly. Any advice would be welcome.

Thanks, Lee

The card gains surge and will force you to reveal the one card you just put back on top of the encounter deck.

As I have been playing it then….. Good to know.

Thanks very much.
