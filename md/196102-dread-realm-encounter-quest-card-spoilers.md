I'm loving this pack!

I was going to mention how Daechanar doesn't look so imposing, he pretty much looks like an evil ranger, but then I read the quest cards. Pretty cool!

I really like that you have to escape after defeating the boss.  First we saw Matt Newman mention that the Chrono Trigger prison break sequences were inspiration for Escape from Mount Doom.  Now we have Metroid, and many games like it, here in front of us.

So he is a Dunedain and a Sorcerer...

 

The packs looks brutal. And awesome!

Gondorian Spear on a Shielded up Beregrond sounds amazing for this quest, if only to knock out Sorceries.

It is a very hard quest.

Use this card, it has helped me a lot:

Great call!

 

I'm also upping my Powers of Orthanc to three copies.

Maybe it's just bad luck, but I have the feeling that, playing in a 3-4 game this quest may be almost impossible to beat unless you use decks specially dedicated for it.

 

In order to explore the location in the stage 2, you need to defeat Daechanar, which is impossible while they are sorcery cards, and revealing 4 cards during mission each round... almost every round 1 or 2 will hit the table. My first game was a 2 player game, and during 5 rounds, we were discarding one sorcery, just to see another one appearing next round... finally we gave it up, being so tired of the quest...

 

Anyway, playing it in solo is fun, and being a hard quest, I believe it is slightly easier than Carn Dûm

I assumed running Gondorian Spearman with dat 2costed Spear attachment for Reanimated Dead instakills. Also, Goblin-Cleaver.

Power of Orthanc seems key here to succeeding in multiplayer. Each person gets to discard a condition attachment so you should be able to clear the board before attacking.

Gildors coulsel would be good for the scorcery. Or Out of the wild (one of my favourite cards, very good with the door is closed). The quest seems to be tactic and lore, would an ent decck be good?

Finally, straight shot gets a day in the sun.
