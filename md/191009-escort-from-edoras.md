Hi,

 

I did search before regarding this, but my feeble brain still requires clarification.

 

So, if there is a location in play before the quest card, does Escort from Edoras still get his +2 questing bonus, or does it need to be directly playing to the quest card.

 

Apologies and many thanks.

As long as Escort from Edoras is committed to the quest, he gets his +2 questing bonus. Whether or not there is an active location is irrelevant.
