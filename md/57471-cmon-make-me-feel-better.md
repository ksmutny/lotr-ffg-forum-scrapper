in light of a few misunderstood rules that have been coming up lately, i have realised that after 9 months of playing this i am still doing a couple of things wrong,

firstly ignoring the forced effect of the first HFG card after id completed that stage, secondly not realising that i could discard as many cards as i wanted for protector of lorien, thirdly playing the guarded rule kind of wrong when two guarded cards come up after each other....anyone else still doing mistakes like this? seems to me after i get each AP it takes me about 2 months to iron out the rules, going back and forth between posts and FAQs just to figure out that some of my victories are now void. Guess its jsut a constant learning curve.

I think everyone can forget something from rules sometimes. Then we look at rules.

And what about two guarded cards?

if a guarded card comes up and the guard card is another guarded i would ignore the first guarded card and leave it unguarded (count the guards in that sentence!) dont know why i did this but i think i miss read the rules and it just stuck, still never mind

I definitely played stage 1B of HfG the wrong way for quite a while. For a week or so, I also thought A Burning Brand could only be attached to "genuine" Lore heroes (i.e. not a hero equipped with the Song of Wisdom). Seems pretty silly in retrospect, although it made sense to me at the time. Oh, and I definitely used Stand and Fight to bring Gandalf back into play (seriously, though--who didn't?).

Don't worry too much about it. You played by the rules as best you understood them at the time. This game is usually pretty straightforward, but there are always tricky situations (e.g. Meneldor's Flight and Vassal of the Windlord). I don't think you should devalue any of your victories, especially the ones in which you DIDN'T use Protector of Lorien to its full effect; if anything, you won those games in spite of a self-imposed handicap. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

When i started playing Dol guldur, I interpeted the guarded rule so that the objective cards got new guards when they weren't guarded anymore and not claimed by the player. Made the quest even harder than it was. I also took the orc guards from the encounter deck, not from the player decks.

When I returned to Dol Guldur recently I forgot the one-ally-per-round restriction.

 

The latest mistake I did was in Rhosgobel - I didn't realize that each card could only heal up to 5 points. That's why I waited until Wilyador had around 15-17 damage and healed him completely with Lore of Imladris. My winning ratio dropped by half after playing it the way it was intended to be.

 

I think I made more mistakes than Wilyador has hitpoints. That's why I'm thankful for this forum being there, and all those fellows who offer their help.

Guarded cards do get new guards during the next quest phase if not claimed by then, don't they?

Guarded cards if not claimed before the next staging part of the quest phase do get new guards, don't they?

No, they don't.

@richsabre: Yes, it happens often that I stumble over something I played wrong a long time.

No, it remains in the staging area, unguarded.

 Doom1502, Dam, thanks!  No wonder this was always so hard!  Even though we finally won on sAturday, we could have done it a little quicker!

The big one that I was playing wrong early on was the use of Stand and Fight to retrieve Gandalf.  I'll usually rule in favor of the game on anything unclear (like the 1A forced effect in HfG when you complete it), but I thought that this was clearly okay to use the G Man.  I was wrong, so wrong.

Just yesterday I've seen that in Dol Guldur we should select prisoner at random! It was real challenge to play without Aragorn or Imrahil.

And I often forget that when you rescue prisoner you should put 1 damage on him.

Do you select hero or cards (Necromancer's Pass) at random and how? It's strange to shuffle 3 or 6 cards.

And for the 3rd step of Passage through Mirkwood quest, it is one of two cards to chose randomly! What I do is to shuffle under the table and pick up the card randomly. If you want "true" random, you could align the cards in front of you and use a D6 die happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]
