# [VASSAL module available](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59564-vassal-module-available/)

Click here for the thread at BGG which has the link for the module and an extended pictorial walkthrough of how to use it: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/756340/vassal-mod-available [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/756340/vassal-mod-available]

Note: I did request permission from FFG to share this, but did not receive a response.  So I'm providing this with the understanding based on their previous response and restriction for the LackeyCCG version, that nothing be added that hasn't been released for at least 6 months.  So currently, this module only includes the base game, Hunt for Gollum and Conflict at the Carrock.  And I can't guarantee that I'll keep up with everything from here... the main purpose for me to have this module is because I travel a lot and I like to be able to play some of my favorite games on my laptop on an airplane or in a motel room, etc.  But with my travel schedule about to hit its busiest time of the year soon, I don't expect to be able to keep up with all of the APs and Khazad-dum, etc.  I'll do what I can, but please don't expect everything to come out in any kind of timely manner.

And no doubt some will prefer to use Lackey to play, but if you're familiar with Vassal, you might find it easier to figure out and play around with.  Lackey is great, but for whatever reasons, I do prefer using this module to play.  Anyway, for what it's worth, it's available.

 Awesome! Thanks! I use Vassal all the time to play long distance Star Wars Saga Edition RPG and Star Wars Miniatures with my brother. This is a great addition!

 So I tried this on the bus on the way to school. As a proxy for play it did alright. There's a little bit of a learning curve, but as long as your familiar with the game, you should be able to figure it out. I did have trouble with saving a game, though. But all-in-all, it's a well-made substitute for the cards if you're travelling. I obviously prefer playing with my actual cards, but there's no way I'd ever be able to play this game on the bus without Vassal or something similar.

Did you figure out how to save it?  Should be pretty straightforward... File > Save Game, then next time you open the module, instead of choosing New Game, choose Load Game and open that saved file.

 I finally got  the save to work. I don't know what was wrong. Yesterday evening when I tried loading my saved game, I got a blank play area with no cards and my threat down to zero. But I just tried it again and it worked fine.

 Vassal should work fine on a Mac. Make sure Java is updated.

I should note that the Vassal module has been updated a few times.  It's now much easier to save decks, and there are private hand windows so the scrying rules can be intact for 2 player games.  Several fan scenarios were added, and a few other tweaks and improvements here and there...
