I got a restock notification from Miniature Market around 6pm EST.Â  9pm EST now and Treason of Saruman/Land of Shadow have gone in 3 hours from 20+ in stock to under 5! Mountain of Fire went from 20+ to gone.

Also, any idea on what is going on with the Dream Chaser cycle? It isn't even listed anywhere on the "upcoming" page and it wasn't part of the restock. I only need The Thing in the Depths and Temple of the Deceived to complete my collection.

About 5 hours ago Miniature Market had 20+ On The Doorsteps in stock.

As of 5 minutes ago they are sold out.Â

The upcoming page is woefully unreliable. I nearly always just check the product page to see if an item is in stock or not.

I believe there's been a twitter post (quoted in another thread somewhere) stating that they're reprinting it in Q2. In other words it's coming!

Oh well, so much for getting Mountain of Fire I guess. I can only hope Shadow and Flame lasts long enough for me to get one.

Well shoot I didn't even get an email notification. Anyone else find any other Mountain of Fire expansions anywhere? It's the only Saga I'm missing and currently starting to feel like Schwarzenegger in Jingle all the Way. Hahaha

Oh, I got the alert Tuesday night and by the time I read it they were sold out at Miniature Market. I'm with you. I hope I can at least get The Mountain of Fire if nothing else to finish of the saga expansions. Hopefully some other stores will get some in soon.

I was worried about missing out and just ordered it all from FFG instead. It costs more but I was tired of constantly checking (not trusting the in-stock notifications).

As far as I can tell, Coolstuffinc hasn't hasn't gotten the restock yet (assuming they're getting it and I didn't miss it), so I would watch them if you missed Miniature Market.

I don't think it's time to panic yet: there're numerous on-line stores you can watch (Game Nerdz, 401 Games, Cool Stuff, On the Table Games, Game Kastle, Atomic Empire, Troll and Toad, â€¦ to say nothing of Amazon, eBay, etc.). And don't forget your FLGS--call them and ask them to order it for you!

Hopefully there will still be some Mountain of Fire somewhere on Wednesday. I can't get it until then.Â ðŸ˜Ÿ

Thank you! They had everything I needed with only one flat rate for shipping! Mountain of Fire here I come!Â ðŸ˜€

The tough part is with various saga/deluxe/adventure packs slowly being restocked, I'm trying to wait for that perfect moment to grab everything I wanted to get all in one big order as opposed to 3-5 smaller orders (which is where I would be at this point).

I foresee a lot of (failed) questing in the future!

Hmm...I think I still have a sealed mountain of fire and road darkens from when I accidentally ordered 2. Might stick them up on eBay at some point.

Hate to say it, but that may not be the best strategy to deal with the way FFG puts out LOTR LCG products.Â  Not if you're really wanting to get everything you're wanting.

At three times retail, I assume?

Youâ€™re not wrong. I ended up just going for what I could. Missed out on the treachery of Saruman. Oh well, next year right?

Looks like Miniature Market has more in stock. Â I see Mountain of Fire and Land of Shadow there.

Thanks, I might have very well missed mountain of fire had you not said something!

Phew glad I ordered one when you posted! Must have bought one of the last copies
