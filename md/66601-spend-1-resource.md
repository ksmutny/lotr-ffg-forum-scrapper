After 7 months of playing this thing came to my mind and made me sick!

The cards that say "spend 1 resource to do that" either from the very hero's pool (Glorfindel) or any other resource pool (Longbeard Map Maker-Lore) 

do not limit that you pay one resource only yes? Can you not pay as many as you want to multiply the effect?

What about Radagast? Can you only heal 3 points of damage in a 3player game? I suppose you can heal less but you have in any case to pay X.

of course - thats the beauty of longbeard- put him with steward of gondor and you can discard 10s of resources to give yourself +10willpower

same with protector of lorien and card discarding

I may be wrong but I think it says limit once per round on Glorfindel's card.  Apologies if I'm mistaken

ah yes - glorfindel is limited- the basic rule here is that unless a card gives you a limit (either per round, phase etc) then you can do the action as long as you fullfill its requirements

also note that some actions are 'quest/resource/attack phase etc.' actions that can only be carried out in those phases

Of course I've noticed the "once per round" but is this a limitation for the ammount of damage points he can heal or for the times he can do it per round?

I mean that perhaps he can heal for instance 3 damage points but only to one character per round. It is logical that he won't be able to heal all hurt

characters in play every round. Even if we suppose he has the resources needed.  preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

"Limit once per round" means Glorfindel's ability may only be triggered once per round.

 This is understood but he can heal as many damage points you like once per round or one damage point per round? From what I know and have read so far I did not find a clear answer.

No just 1 wound. For more they would have written "Spend X resources to heal X wounds on a character (limited once per round)"

Fair enough. I had a little hope for Glorfindel!
