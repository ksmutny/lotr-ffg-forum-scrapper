Ever caught yourself starting to do that?

Doing? No. Wishing? Oh, yeah.

I evaluated the possibility to implement such concept balance-wise.

My Thalin + Triple-Anborn/Sword-thain/Wingfoot deck may not exactly be street legal, but that doesn't mean it's not fun.

Definitely played multiplayer games where we only noticed we had hero Hama and ally Hama in play together after several rounds. But I can't think of any time I've seen duplicate unique allies on the board.

"Duping" is a process in A Game of Thrones where you can protect a character from a variety of effects that cause a character to leave play by taking another copy of that character and putting it in play underneath the original, discarding the duplicate to negate that effect.

I've definitely had trouble with having both Bofurs in play. They're really useful splash allies, and find their way into a lot of my decks.

There is no damage in AGoT, so the mechanic doesn't translate, but I find myself almost automatically doing it now.

Well, mechanicly you could discard dupe to prevent any effect that would cause an ally to leave play, like return to your hand, discard from play, or even damage.

Glorfindel SORT of already does this. I mean he isn't free the second time but you can essentially put him back into play as many times as you want if you have the resources to do so...

I don't see how putting a copy of unique ally underneath his copy in play and discarding it later to prevent that ally from leaving play is even SORT of playing an ally from your discard pile. Two completely different things.

 

Also, on a side note, to seriously consider duplicating mechanic from AGoT in LotR, another thing must be implemented as well: dead pile.

I remember my very first game with the core set, I had 2 Steward of Gondor on Aragorn and piling up a lot of resources, while I was thinking "This is so broken, there's something weird here"...

Good point.

In a Caldara deck that probably happens if he gets destroyed somehow ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] First ally to find his way back if you discard Caldara!

Dupe everybody and then use scry to ensure you have Sleeping Sentry as Shadow and rise your middlefinger when it discards your dupes!
