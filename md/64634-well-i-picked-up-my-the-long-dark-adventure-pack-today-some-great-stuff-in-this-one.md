I totally agree. What we need is a DEFENSE tactics hero not another attacking themed one. We already have 4 of those! (Gimli, Legolas, Elladan, and Brand) not even counting Boromir (because I think he can make a pretty good defender also).

I'm not too thrilled. However, it is cool having a Tactics rohan hero although, again, it would have been even better to have him be a defender so you could run Eowyn, Hama, and Dunhere. Oh well. He acts as a replacement for Dunhere I guess, if you want to do some more direct combat instead of Dunhere style combat.

Brian on Cardboard of the Rings should be happy at least!

While I can't claim that Hama is great, I think he is roughly in line with other Tactics heroes. I expect to continue to see a theme of Tactics heroes and characters benefiting from attacking. I was hoping that we would get one that actually resulted in a net card draw (even if it meant you had to kill an enemy). So to that end, I am rather disappointed.

Hama is great!

As long as you keep getting enemies to fight, you can have Feint or Unseen Strike or something every turn once you find one.

Or in an Eagle deck, you could do The Eagles Are Coming  every turn to get a hecka eagle army out fast and to quickly power up the Eagles of Misty Mountains.

And he's Rohan for all those tricks.

 

A bunch of cards from this pack look great though.

Hama is fantastic. The ability to recur cards like Feint or Hail of Stones is pretty insane. If you're playing mono-Tactics or using Song of Battle, you can stall enemy attacks indefinitely with Thicket of Spears. Under the right circumstances, he's actually one of the best defensive heroes in the game, as he turns any card in your hand into an event that negates an enemy attack. 

Basically, you no longer have to be judicious with your Tactics events. Do I use Feint on this Mountain Warg or save it for The Watcher? With Hama, I don't have to choose. That's a terrific advantage.

Interesting hero, especially for solo players. Yes, playing Feint or Quick Strike every single round looks very promising (but costy). This is especially true for the Dwarrowdwelf expansions in which shadow effects are getting really nasty. I consider it a big help to be able to prevent them from happening.

Hama is also strong in attack, so all you need is a Veteran Axehand to kill most of the feinted enemies in a single turn.

If you start with 0 cards in hand, after using Hama, won't you have to discard the card you just picked up? First you pick a card and put it into your hand, then have to pick and choose a card to discard and since you only have 1 card in hand…

I agree, too. I get where they're coming from with this ability, since Hama retrieves the sword for Theodin, they gave him a card-retrieving ability. But I think giving him a 1 for attack and 3 for defense would have been great. After all, he was standing guard to Theodin's hall, so a defensive build would have been perfect for him. Then the response could have triggered when he was declared as a defender instead of as an attacker.

Why costly? It's a cycle, you choose two cards to swap places. There is virtually no cost involved.
His ability turns any card in your hand in any card in your discard pile, even Unique events (when they exist). He also can only become stronger with the passing of APs bringing more Tactics events to the table.

 

I find him amusing. Way more interesting than the Reponse Twins.

I find the complaints about his defense amusing.  As long as you draw one feint card he is one of, if not the, best defensive heroes in the game.

## 15 [Budgernaut on May 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64634-well-i-picked-up-my-the-long-dark-adventure-pack-today-some-great-stuff-in-this-one/?do=findComment&comment=631953)

If you want to rely on Feint, go ahead. First, though, you have to draw Feint, and if you're playing with one core, you'll only have two copies in your deck. If you never draw Feint in the first place, your strategy is shot. If it works, you're right, it is a good defensive strategy because it opens up one more attack action because you have one less character to declare as a defender. But let's say you have two engaged enemies. You Feint against one, but still have to defend against the other. It would be nice to have a Tactics hero that excels at defense instead of offense.

See, at least with a defensive Tactis hero, the hero always has the option of defending, rather than relying on drawing the right card for the Hama strategy.

How would Hama interact with quick strike? Does exhausting and resolving your attack (as quick strike reads) function as "declaring as an attacker?"

I think he looks solid for his cost. I was hoping for a high quest (3) hero, as i still dont think solo tactics is at all playable, or another dwarf, but I think this works well for allowing me to dabble some tactics into my pure rohan deck.

+1 for this

And "The eagles are coming" in an egale deck to get all your eagles into your hand in few turns (paying for Hamas abilty with multiple Landrowals afterwards for example)

Awesome Hero

I agree that Hama is a much stronger hero than many people are realizing. Like someone said, he has the ability to retrieve specific events to defeat enemies before any defenders are involved (Quick Strike) or negate an attack from an enemy, possibly multiples (Feint). Another thing that no one is mentioning is that this guy is a Rohan Warrior. He could be put into a Rohan deck and benefit from different Rohan synergies. However, I would have gladly traded a 10 threat hero for +1 on the defense but I can't wait to put this guy on the war path. I think he might work really well in a Rohan deck or Tactic/Leadership with the Twins. As long as resources don't become an issue The Twins and Hama have the ability to defend and attack with some ferocity.

With one card, they put Tactics on track to be playable in solo play. Well done!

Upon first glance, I had the exact same thought others had about running a Tactics/Spirit combo using Dunhere, Eowyn, and this guy. I would just put in a bunch of cheap 1-cost tactics events and a handful of Tactics allies who are geared specifically toward blocking. With a Rohan centered theme, a lot of event cards I don't normally play would suddenly find themselves as the centerpiece of their very own deck concept. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don't buy the complaints about not being able to block if you have more than one enemy and are repeatedly throwing Feint at one of them. No smart player who has the option would be blocking with a hero anyway, unless of course he/she is in control of the specific combat situation (ie a Lore character with a 2 defense with Burning Brand on it blocking a 2 attack enemy, or Hasty Stroke in his/her hand when he/she blocks with the hero). If you are having blocking issues, put more allies in your deck.

Curious to know what else is in this set, if anyone has time to post the cards. Player cards I mean, not encounter cards. I will see those when I get my copy.

 Tactics is GREAT at defending.

If you're playing with Eagles, that is. 

 

Otherwise Leadership and Lore both FAR outstrip Tactics when it comes to Defending. 

 

I'm not excited by Hama, but I'm not saddened either. His ability has some great potential and I've been wanting a Tactics hero for Rohan. I think he's more generally useful than Dunhere's. Which is not to say that Dunhere's ability isn't cool, it definitely is, but it's also more niche. I've gone whole games without ever getting to use his ability.

I agree that Dunhere is not super fit in every quest. But I would argue his usefulness is on ascendency - with the exception of the Watcher, there he could do little but Unseenly Quick Strike some Mountain Wargs.

A hero that is designed to burn through events to optimally use puts a significant amount of pressure on the card advantage of a deck. Not to say that it can't be done or isn't effective, but the reality is that this optimizes event usage which have temporary effects on the board. I am glad to see events get a boost since a board permanent has an inherent advantage. But Hama is as card hungry as any card in the game outside of Protector of Lorien (if you play it right).

I use to play previous Lotr card game from Decipher and this errata idea come from this game. From the begining they also have unlimited draw like Lotr lcg( for now) but quickly they understand is too unbalance and create the rule no more then 4 cards you can draw 1 turn.

In my opinion strategy when 1 player in the begin of the game just draw lot of cards with Beravur while other players defend and fight quite unbalanced.

Then Beravur player draw 25 cards in his hand and start to quest and run. This strategy very effect but also very boring! Cose of this i never play Beravur.

But even without Beravur POL is still very powerful.

I think Word of command is an insanely cool card (thematically speaking), but we'll need more Istari cards to really be able to use it to full potential. I don't see myself using it with Radagast in my eagle deck, nor do I see myself exhausting Gandalf just to search my deck for a specific card. Way to expensive.

Sneak attack + Gandalf + Word of command is awesome, but that's a 3-card combo.

The scenario itself is ranked as difficulty 7. Got it today, used my old deck (Loragorn, Théodred, Frodo) without any changes and had five easy and one tough wins. So either my deck is that strong or they erred about the diffiulty again. I am somewhat disappointed.

We also beat the quest in the first run in a 2 player game. Perhaps we were just lucky (no Cave Troll, no Goblin Warlord), but I guess 7 is a bit too high. But I like the quest. The locate mechanic is very nice and fitting, and some player cards (e.g. Elder of the Healers - if that's the proper English title, I'm buying a translated version) are pretty good and especially Words of Command is thematically great! Superb drawing, and the first "Spell" for Istari characters, yippie! And I also liked the drawing of some encounter cards (the titles should be something like "Quiet Grottos" and "Cave Spider").

Interesting read, but nothing in it that convinces me he couldn't be Istari, at least the possibility is not ruled out. If the Tolkien family would agree to it, why not?

i highly doubt the tolkien family would agree though……..id eat my 3 copies of gandalf if they did gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

besides bombadils words all point to him being very ancient - at least before sauron, if not melkor- so that puts him well before the 'istari' came about…..fair enough gandalf and the likes existed before in the undying lands as maiar, but the idea of istari only came about to counter act saurons last rise to power

…..i suppose gandalf makes some remarks that could …..such as the moss gatherer and stone rolling…..so he could be a form of wizard set a different task long before the istari came….but this would still not make him an istari

I am pretty sure he won't be Istari. But then what? Probably no trait whatsoever would be most fitting. Now that you mentioned him, he's on top of my wishlist, all for the ol' Tom Bombadilo!

Also there is Saruman, Gandalf, Radagast, Alatar and Pallando… so a few we having seen yet .. and I see no reason we can not use Saruman.. he was a good guy for a very long time.. if the games time line wasn't a broken dogs leg we could argue for or against this.

yeah i wouldnt mind seeing saruman…..i would prefer it if he came with a hefty price for using him

sort of like a one turn 'gandalf' card, only more powerful, but when you play him you have to raise your threat by alot

Fan card from cardboard of the rings, but i think something like this would be awesome.

Going by the previous logic, he shall only be called Saruman…(not the White).

I am puzzled whether he shall make it as an ally but it is certainly one card title that could appear as both an ally and enemy. Well, Gollum has already been an objective, will be enemy soon and hopefully one day an ally also.

I'd love to see a Saruman the White, but I wonder if they will do that as it would limit a big enemy later. Like, how do you make him a player card but not screw over the encounter deck?

I guess those eventual scenarios would all be forced to start Saruman out in the Staging area during setup, making it so you can't even play the player card version right from the start like the Arwens, or something like that.

Or I wonder if cards that are set aside, out of play like the Nazgul of Dol Guldur or the Carrock Trolls count for uniqueness restrictions. For every other card game, I'd say no, but this game for some reason they already established that the out of play Victory Display area can still be interacted with, so I guess that's not too far of a stretch either.

sarumans chief power was words- therefore i think any saurman card should have some nice ability to control enemy cards as player cards or a turn….it would be complex but hey…..it would be worth it

Well, all the scenarios could have a little note: No other copies of Saruman can enter play. Just like the two with Arwen do. I don't find it that much of an obstacle and do not expect to see Saruman as an enemy in more than a handful of quests. Plus he probably would begin the game in the staging area (or out of play) anyways.

Or you can always portray Saruman's evil side as a Treachery of sorts - which would be quite fitting in his case.

How about the trait Tom Bombadil ? It sounds pretty unique and so a pretty good fit for him gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Yes. Wow, I do wonder whether they've been scratching their head over him already. He must be a nightmare to design, it has got to be special otherwise people like me will start going crazy (like with the original Glorfindel). But it is easy to make a special thing get too powerful. Poor designers, at least they're draining our wallets dry enough.

with characters as special as bombadil i think the designers should take a note from tolkien- less is more…..ie he has to be an event or ally and his abilities have to be limited so that he fits with the narrative

 I think Bombadil will probably be an objective like Grimbeorn the Old. That would make the most sense because I don't think Tom Bombadil ever really travelled away from his forest, did he?

Agreed. This makes sense to me.

Yes, you are so right, that would make sense indeed… and I would be at peace with it although the childish part of me still wants him as an ally in my deck.

I remember he was a card in the tcg game, I haven't played it much but I remember buying multiple packs of it just to get him; and never have obviously.

im just waiting for a comment from a certain player saying 'theme is already broken!….if we can take frodo and glorfindel and denethor on a quest bombadil can leave his forest' ……well no…not in this case i think
