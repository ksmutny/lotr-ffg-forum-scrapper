I have bought multiple core sets. Are we supposed to upgrade the Encounter Deck to 3x X cards?

 

I have been playing it that way and it seems to be a little bit easier in single player but gets harder with multiple people.

 You're not supposed to do this, but you play the way you like ^^

 Nothing official yet but there's one thread in these forums that gather most of the rules questions (check for the FAQ keyword ^^).
