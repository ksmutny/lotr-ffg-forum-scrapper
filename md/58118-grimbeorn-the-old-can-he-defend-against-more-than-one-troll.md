 Since grimbeorn doesn't exhaust to defend against troll enemies, does this mean he can defend against more than one troll attack during a round?

Yes. He's the Middle Earth variant of Chuck Norris.

Nice. I hope every kind of earth throughout time and space gets to have their own personal Chuck Norris variant. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

Sure glad we do.

 Nuts!  I could probably have a much lower score if I had known this the other day!!!

Wow, after all this time I realize I've always played that wrong. Somehow I thought you'd have to declare all of your defending characters at the same time...

I think the game just got a bit easier.

so does this mean you have been playing it as unexpected courage cant allow multiple defends?

 I actually was playing this way until only about two weeks ago. I was also under the impression that defenders and attackers all had to be declared at once, like with questing.

It was a wonderful revelation when I reread the rule book and figured out the real rule!
