So, tonight, as 3 of us played into the pit, when we had several enemies against us and in the staging area, I sneak attacked with Longbeard Orc slayer and the the next round paid to put him in full.  Every Orc, which was every enemy in play got two damage in less than a round, and many went bye-bye!!!  Wished I had him in for the second game when we did the seventh level and got overrun in stage 2b.

Yep, he's a nice little orc-slayer ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Also, Thalin plus Longbeard Orcslayer equals a good time.

I know, it's really cool to see old cards find renewed usefullness!

Also, Thalin plus Gondorian Spearman = Awesome

 Don't forget how useful Blade of Gondolin has become now too! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Frodo and Bilbo actually benefit quite nicely from this card now (as well as any non-dwarf hero).

Tonight I played 7th Level with 3 players. My shining moment was when I played Longbeard and killed  4  Goblins and damaged 3 others!!!  

Boo - yah!!!

Let the party begin!!!  We played last night with 3 players too, but everytime we got to stage 2b, that extra 3 cards was almost always an extra 3 enemies and we just got swamped!
