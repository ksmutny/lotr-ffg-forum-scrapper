Did I miss it or has a release date for RtM been announced?

I have a $10 credit on Amazon and I'd LOVE to use it on that...  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

FFG's catalog says November 2011, and they seem to be on pace for that.  I'd say just after Thanksgiving perhaps?

 It's status on the Upcoming page was changed to "Shipping Now" last friday.  That status is typically given 7-10 days before the release date.
