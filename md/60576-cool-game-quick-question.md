 I like this game (especially for when I cannot find an agot game). I am about to jump into the deck building game and was wondering if there were any restrictions besides matching the spheres (like 3x per card or 60 card min like aGoT).

no more than x3 of every card, 50 card minimum deck size.  Also, you can't play 0 cost cards of a sphere without a hero of that sphere.

Matching spheres isn't a "restriction". You can have cards from all 4 spheres in your deck if you want (and heroes from 3 different spheres). I've heard of decks actually using all 4 spheres (3 heroes from different spheres and song cards to gain the extra resource) so it is possible.

 I'm currently playing solo with two decks.  Both decks have Heroes from 3 different spheres and cards from all 4 spheres included in each (+ all the song cards).

So far they're doing great!  I've managed to beat the 3 Core Set quests plus HfG and CatC.  Next up Rhosgobel!

50 card minimum? Arent the core decks like 30 cards?

Yes. Those are 'learn-to-play' decks.

I believe this is incorrect. You need a resource match to be able to play a card (page 12 of the rules). So to play Khazad Khazad (a zero cost tactics card) you need to have a hero with a tactics resource pool. You can then remove zero tokens from it to play the card. Without a resource match, you can't play the card.

Isn't that what he just said?

This is only a restriction for tournament decks. Feel free to use a 30 card deck if you like.
