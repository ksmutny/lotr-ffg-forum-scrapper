I just have a question about Rhosgobel.  If I happen to finish the scenario before I travel to Rhosgobel, and it's still in the staging area when I reach the third stage in the quest, does that mean I can't heal Wilyador at all, even with the Athelas?

Rhosgobel says :"While Rhosgobel is in the staging area, Wilyador cannot be healed"

So you cant not heal the eagle in any way. No Events, Allies, Objectives or quest cards.

I guess you have to visit Radagast. But watch for Birds shitting on your head ;-)

I agree.

 

But you can even explore Rhosgobel even before stage 2 of that quest with, for instance, Northern Tracker…

Yeah, or with something like Thror's map.  But I was just making sure, cause I didn't know if the quest cards bypassed that effect.  Anyway, thanks!
