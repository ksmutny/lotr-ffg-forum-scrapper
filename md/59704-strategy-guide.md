Has there been any talk about an official or at least well-produced Strategy Guide for LotR LCG?

ICE made a few nice books for their MECCG games back in the '90s: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Collectible_Card_Game#Books [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle-earth_Collectible_Card_Game#Books]

...and I was wondering if FFG (or someone else) has plans for something similar.

the late 90s was a whole different world for the profitability of CCGs and various supporting products.  If you want to know what you can expect for this game, you are better off comparing it to longer running LCGs (Call of Cthulhu and Game of Thrones).  So, we may see something like an art book down the road.

An art book?

Hmm.

Aren't there already enough Tolkien-related art books out there?  And to be honest, I don't think the cart art on LotR LCG can really compete with Alan Lee, John Howe, Ted Nasmith, and all the other awesome Tolkien artists. 

Hopefully FFG will think more in terms of the game than the art.
