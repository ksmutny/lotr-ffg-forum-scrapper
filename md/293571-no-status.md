Anyone else find it weird that most of the games packs don't show on the upcoming page at all anymore?  No awaiting reprint like they used to be.  Anyone else find that disturbing?

It'd be more disturbing if most of the game packs hadn't recently been reprinted.  There's only three LOTR LCG now on the "awaiting reprint", but there's no less than 8 reprints "Shipping Now" (Mirkwood cycle + Grey Havens + Black Rider).  Back products get added in bunches, so I expect the next update to awaiting reprint to show whatever has gone out of stock since then (or in the case of the reprints, whatever has gone *back* out of stock since then).

For comparison, the most recent (remaining) addition to the awaiting reprint for LOTR was 11/7/2018, while the most recent addition for Arkham Horror is 7/25/2018.  As tardy as the updates are for our game, it could be worse.

Anything beyond shipping now is completely inconsistent at best.  Zero to be concerned about there

I've noticed that.  I'm missing one adventure pack, and it's not on the list for "awaiting reprint".  I'm hopeful that it will show up at some point though.
