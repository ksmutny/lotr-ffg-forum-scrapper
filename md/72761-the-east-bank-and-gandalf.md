The text of "The East Bank" location card from the Hunt for Gollum deck says "ally cards cost one additional matching resource to play from hand" when its the active location.  (Emphasis added, of course gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]).  As I read this text, there would be no additional cost for playing Gandalf from your hand; i.e., as a neutral ally, there are no "matching resources" involved.  To this end, in the Core Rules, under "Paying for Neutral Cards," it states that neutral cards "require no resource match to play."

Any thoughts from more experienced players?  (I apologize if this is covered in the rules, errata, or FAQ somewhere -- I did look for an answer and didn't get a match when I searched the forum here for "east bank" either).

Thanks!

 I presume there is no additional cost, for the reason you stated -- there's no matching resource.  To tell the truth, I hadn't really thought about it before and have probably played it wrong in the past.  Anyone else want to weigh in?

well i can certainly see why you say that- that is how it is worded……however i think it means 'all allies'…the reason?

well the west bank affects all the events and attatchments and likewise i imagine the east does the same for allies. it is worded poorly thought, and i have been playing this since hfg came out as 'all allies' as i really think this is what the card means…

you could always send in a rules request…there are several cards that ffg word in a way if you take too literally make no sense or have been FAQed otherwise, i think this is one of them

Good news from a player's standpoint!  Just got a rule clarification from FFG; here's their response to the question in this thread:

You are correct: because Gandalf is a neutral ally with no "matching resource icon" you do not need to pay any additional resources to play him while The East Bank is the active location.

You had me second-guessing myself though Rich -- goes to show how these things can go either way sometimes!  That legalistic feature of this game is something I really enjoy, even if I suspect it may not be to many people's taste.
