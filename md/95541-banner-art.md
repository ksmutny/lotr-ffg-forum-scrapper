I'm finishing up my filing of all my cards and would like to put some of the fantastic art on the covers. Where is the best place to find it? Would love hi-res images of Arwen, Strider, Elladan and Elrohir.

Hmmm to be honest I'm kinda tired of the same style poster art. I'd use less conventional choices like for leadership, Strength of Arms; spirit, Fortune or Fate, for lore Radagast's cunning; on tactics I agree Forth Eorlingaas is great.

While I appreciate the ideas where can I find the art?

Deviantart mostly. I don't know if there's all the pieces I said but most of the illustration online are in there.

yes, Gizlivadi is correct, though as a user of Deviantart i know its unlikely you will get high res there. I limit my own work to low res so im guessing other artisits do the same.

Arwen, Elladan and Elrohir are by Magali Villeneuve. Google her name for images and they'll pop up, fairly big.

 

A nice large version of Strider is on Deviantart.com

 

You can find a lot of cool things by just searching for lord of the rings lcg and images. Lots of artists post their work on their personal blogs but deviantart is definitely the hub.

 

This is awesome as well:
