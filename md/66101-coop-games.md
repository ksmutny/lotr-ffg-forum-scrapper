Are there any other co-op games by ffg besides LOTR?

Thanks

The Lord of the Rings: The Board Game is a co-op and (in my view) very good.

Mansions of Madness and Middle Earth Quest are semi-cooperative in that a team of players can play the "good guys" while one player takes the forces of darkness.

Arkham Horror, Space Hulk - Death Angle , Lord of the Rings the Board Game. Mansions of Madness (players vs dungeon master), Decent (players vs dungeon master) Cosmos (alliance game). Elder Sign, Fury of Dracula (players vs dungeon master)

There could be more but these are just the ones I own.

 Wow. Thanks for the list!  I hope Star Wars ends up being coop. I read the posts over on the other forum and it's a bit of a mystery at this point.

I'll have to check out the LOTR game. Is that one suitable for solo (if one player acts as two players)?

yes it is…..i play it that way…..i wouldnt say its a 'huge' amount of fun as it isnt designed with this method of play in mind, however i think the john howe art and lovely boards make up for it

---its worth noting i have the original so i dont know if the FFG version differs

In addition, Gears of War, a fully-cooperative game for 1 to 4 players.

Our game group has been meaning to get this for a while.. Is it good.. I assume you like it as you have it as a avatar :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. I have been waiting for  "watch it played" to run it.. as it is in their list.

I am strongly in the camp of wanting this to be a LoTR clone… as in co-op / solo play and a encounter deck.. this was what was originally announced and I see no "evidence" either way.. but we will find out soon enough. Still Netrunner is a card game with a scifi theme that is known to be pvp.. so I think it woudl make sense for them to make this co-op.

like all co-op games yes it can be played solo.. but this one isn't as good at solo as you would think. It also has a lot of really cool expansions that improve the game a ton.. though one of them introduces a Dungeon Master (as someone can play Sauron vs the players). I just do not think this really a game that is fun solo. The game itself is very good though in co-op… it is also great for kids as it isn't very complex.

The FFG version is identical to the original apart from typical FFG style improvments to the componants and the art on the main board, this is debatabel as an improvmet.. but there are no changes to the rules. .

I've played it a few time, some solo and some co-op.  It's quite challenging, and the AI (the system-controlled Locusts) is better than that in, e.g., the Ravenloft Castle boardgame by WotC.  However, it is heavily luck dependent.  I think you have to play it (or at least watch it played) to see if you would like it.
