Quick question, if I have a hero with an attachment and he or she now has 2 spheres of influence, does he or she collect 2 resource tokens on the resource phase, 1 for each sphere or does he/she only collect 1 period. I think its still just 1 because its per hero but wanted to make sure. Thanks guys!

Just 1 resorce is collected.

but you can spend those resources on the other spheres and targets that need the card to be a resource type.
