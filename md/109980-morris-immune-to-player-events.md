Hi,
 
playing Conflict at the Carrock on nightmare mode. 
Is it legal to use Thicket of Spears [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=36] so that Morris [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=4042] cannot attack, if he is engaged with me?

You can use thicket of spears but, even though the rest of your non-immune engaged enemies will be affected by it, Morris will not.

I didn't find anything on thicket of spear not affecting immuned enemies. Did I miss it in the faq or is it in an official response ?

FAQ 1.47

Cards with the text "Immune to player card effects" ignore the effects of all player cards.

 

 

So Morris ignores the effect of thicket of spears.
