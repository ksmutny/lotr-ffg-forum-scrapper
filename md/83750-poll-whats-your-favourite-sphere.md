# [Poll : What&#039;s your favourite sphere ?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83750-poll-whats-your-favourite-sphere/)

## 1 [DevastazioneH88 on May 12, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83750-poll-whats-your-favourite-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=794605)

I was curious about everyone's favourite sphere in the game…You can say what's your second favourite as well if you want…just give a few reasons for your vote (characters you like are in that sphere, cards you like, combos you like playing are in that sphere, a specific aspect of the sphere itself, anything)

 

My vote goes to Tactics : I love the fighting mechanic of this game, it's simple, fast and very enjoyable. Moreover most of my favourite characters are in the Tactics sphere (Legolas, Hama, Landroval, Bard, Boromir, Beregond, Elladan), I like eagles a lot and I love to put one (or two) blade of gondolin on Leoglas to progress more by killing than by questing, I also enjoy Hama+blade of gondolin+foe hammer.

 

My second favourite sphere would be Leadership : I just love to have resources to play everything just when I need it. Sneak attack and Steward of Gondor are two of the strongest cards in the game (I love them). There are a few characters I like (Aragorn, Boromir, Imrahil, Elrohir, Theodred, Faramir). One of the features I love is boosting WP with faramir (sometimes twice with ever vigilant).

My favorite is Lore.  Lore can quest, fight (Haldir, Mirkwood Runner, Gildor), Look at encounter deck (Gildor's Counsel, Denethor,) Heal, of course, and they got ranger spikes.  yeah… I think they are the most balenced sphere.

Second is Tactics.  I just love all the attachments they have.  I also love the eagles and other allies.  They have the most fun Heroes I think.

My favourite is Tactics. The HoN quests made it even more useful, because it can now be good for questing too. The only thing I miss there are some good non-race specific weapons.

 

Second favourite is probably Lore. Card draw and healing are really helpful, Forest snare or Burning brand have saved my bacon many times as well.

Lore. firstly, im a man of knowledge and learning so it fits right in there. secondly i love the art of many of the lore cards….i mean i love all the art, but there's probably more lore cards than any other. secondly i feel lore needs you to engage more than the others. spirit has an obvious way to use it, so does tactics, and to a lesser degree leadership. but lore needs you to think more

You love all art? What do you think of Stright Shot and Gunabad Archer?? I HATE that art.

Or what about Dori [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/over-hill-and-under-hill/dori-ohauh], for that matter?

well perhaps not all, but close to it. thinking off the top of my head i can think of the following i dislike…usually because i do not feel the art fits with the theme of the game (even though the art is generally mixed):

henmarth riversong

 dunedain watcher

Pleased to see my love for Lore reflected by others! My favorite is definitely the green sphere because it is fairly well-rounded. Some of my favorite cards are Ranger Spikes, Gildor's Counsel, Radagast's Cunning, and Secret Paths.

Spirit…

 

I'm all for threat reduction …

Leadership

Not really even sure why, i just feel they mesh really well both solo and with all the other spheres.  They have a lot of interesting cards and some of the coolest heroes not only within the context of the game but also the books like Aragorn, Boromir, and Thorin

I too like most of the art. I find Dori to be among the best. I also like both Henamarth Riversong and Dúnedain Watcher. I am not very fond of some of the new Outlands, I wish they were all more like Hunter of Lamedon (Hirluin, Swordsman and Knights are good though).

As for the original question, my favourite sphere is Lore also. But not to play really right now. I agree its strategies are most intriguing. They are just not that developed or effective yet, compared to Spirit. I like all the spheres, however, and their distinction. I feel this was a masterful idea, and it is one that makes the game so very special. Having traits is obvious, and I hope some of the lesser traits (Warrior, Ranger) will be soon developed, as will all the national or race traits, of course; but the spheres are extra.

I agree with you Ileimmoen !

I gotta say tactics. I don't know… I guess I just really like to feel that satisfaction of having 15 attack on 2 defense. cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]mono [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/mono.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]mono [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/mono.gif]cafe [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cafe.gif]  Second favorite would be hard to say… Probably lore, but spirit in close second.

Probably lore…….

Lore for me. Some of the mechanics I most enjoy are Lore based (I really like encounter deck manipulation).
