The new Faramir Hero is just amazing! The quest is extremely location heavy and once you successfully quest through locations, you "gain" them in front of you. It is a really well thought out siege-type scenario. 

 

Player cards are, well, they're okay in my opinion. Faramir is the real shiner in this scenario! The is a Gondorian Knight who is pretty cool though, 3 cost: 0 wp, 3 attk, 1 def, 3 life. He has the text, "if all of your hero's have a tactics icon, he gains, As soon as Gondorian Knight comes into play you may engage an enemy in the staging area and immediately make an attack against that enemy." I am paraphrasing the text here, but you get the point I'm sure.

Oh yeah, the knight is a tactics card.

FedEx has mine on the way too. I think there's a few cards that will hop straight into the decks I have been working on.
