# [What Two Heroes Will Be Featured In Sands Of Harad?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228778-what-two-heroes-will-be-featured-in-sands-of-harad/)

What two heroes do you think will be included in the new deluxe expansion? The description says that it will be two heroes who work well together, so I'm guessing (and hoping) it will be a spirit Sam and a leadership Frodo. Post your ideas below.

New Frodo and Sam would be more found in the last Sage box, I guess?

For this box, probably a dwarf and elf hero combo that synergise together?

I'm almost sure it's the new Legolas and Gimli that we've been waiting for for much too long now. But I could also see it being a new Elladan and Elrohir.

Well, Unexpected Friendship keys off of having a Silvan and Dwarf character, obviously referencing Gimli and Legolas' friendship. But it's a Leadership card, and our current hero versions of Legolas and Gimli are both Tactics, so neither of them could actually use the card.

 

That leads me to believe that the heroes in this box will be a synergistic Legolas and Gimli, with one of them being Leadership.

Leadership Gilmi and Spirit Legolas would be great, and are very likely!

We already have 4 Lore silvan heroes, so another Lore Silvan hero is unlikely. Futhermore, there are a lot of silvan allies (5 with the Drowned ruins new ally) in the spirit sphere, and no Silvan spirit heroes. Would be nice to have one. :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]  Especially Legolas.

For Gilmi we have his leadership ally version. A leadership hero Gimli could be cool.

I'd like to see a new Gimli, at least. I've not played his current hero version since mirkwood, and while I rarely play legolas, I do still use him on occasion. So it's a shame for such an important character to be sidelined. A nice new version would be good.

Everything suggests a new version of Legolas and Gimli , but dwarves and elves do not make a good impression in the desert ... I hope there are Alatar and Pallando , other Istari , as heroes or allies .

Looking at the player cards spoiled so far, I think it's gonna be Legolas and Gimli, with the rest of the cards being another potpourri of traits with Silvan, Dunedain, etc.

Which is so meh to me. The Harad desert finally seemed to be the place where we would discover new mystical stuff, and while the new Harad heroes/allies sound exciting,the fact that the box itself is just going to be another smattering of races that could just be in any other cycle is so boring. At least they could include an actual unique Palantir or Lesser Ring, but getting more of the typical races in the Harad box sounds really unexciting. I wonder how many people will call this one their favorite deluxe expansion as opposed to Grey Havens and Lost Realm, which brought so many new themes unlike this one.

especially considering the Unlikely Friendship card, 'working well together' is pretty relative

i also think it'll be new versions of Legolas and Gimli though. they fight like an old married couple but work pretty well together

i'm also hoping/speculating we'll get some Harad heroes in addition to the obvious Harad allies (we know we're getting at least one and seems extremely likely we'll get a few more besides)

the last couple of cycles has given us a Harad objective-ally that became a hero later on in the cycle, so maybe we'll see the same thing again. this intrinsically kind of rules out getting one in the box, but i have a feeling we'll get this again.

I think it's pretty much a given we'll get a Harad hero, which I'm really excited about.

Those heroes and attachments are really good. I will use them for sure (Three Hunters deck finally a thing?) but this is certainly the least excited I've been for a deluxe expansion to be honest.

I found them (new Legolas and new Gimli) quite disappointing :/

 

The Dwarven Shield is kinda weird since the abilities point in different directions... you either make a good defense thanks to the +1def, but then you don't gain any resources, or take damage and gain resources,but then the extra defense was kinda irrelevant...

I think they are pretty good together....right out of the gate you are getting 5 actions a turn with some stat boosts...even without each other you can capitalize on the ready-ing. Of course , you need some card draw and resource gen to keep it going. Finally making a good "three hunters" deck would be awesome.

As for the kind of opposite abilities of the shield...I kinda like the "if plan A doesn't work, at least there is a silver lining" aspect. Add Loragorn for some access to healing/card draw and you've got a pretty good engine here

Thinking in solo, these two with Leadership Aragorn might be good. For resources you have Steward, and for card draw you have Elven-light which works great with Legolas, and of course you have Unlikely Friendship that does both. Plus with 2 leadership heroes and Steward it'll be very easy to play Sword that was Broken, so that deck might be pretty good.

I like them. They each work well with the Tactics versions of the other too. Legolas can give tactics Gimli additional defense in order to mitigate some damage but still gain attack strength. Gimli can pump up Legolas' attack to kill enemies and make progress. There should be some interesting combos available between the four heroes.

It's a bit disappointing that their abilities don't work with their ally versions. It would have been nice if the wording was "ready another hero or Gimli/Legolas" rather than just ready a hero.

agreed about Dwarven Shield. i don't think i'll use it.

i'm on the fence about Mirkwood Long-knife. on the one hand, similar willpower-boosting attachments are costed 2:1, so in that sense, it's an extra attack on top of extra questing, but it requires extra readying effects (granted, it's in the sphere of Unexpected Courage)

my hesitation is the fact that it's restricted and how it's horribly costed for similar attack-boosting abilities. i really like it for traditional Silvan decks with Celeborn, Naith Guide, Unexpected Courage, and/or Light of Valinor to get the most out of his pretty decent all-around stats

but i don't like it that much for Legolas + Gimli (which seems to be what it was designed for). say we have a deck with Spirit Legolas, Leadership Gimli, and you put two Mirkwood Long-knives on Legolas, you're paying 4 resources + 1 resource every time he quests to get 3 extra questing power out of Legolas.

alternatively, you could simply give Legolas a Rivendell Blade for a lot cheaper, spend less on allies to quest for more. and in fact, i don't know that i much like the new Legolas/Gimli combo because you pretty much have to quest with Legolas to make Gimli's ability trigger for Legolas, have to quest with Legolas for his ability at all, which means you're discarding a card and spending a resource every turn or probably not doing it at all (or just readying with Gimli's ability for someone who isn't Legolas)

that said, i'll certainly try them out before i make a final judgement, and i have a feeling there will be more cards that are intended to work on the combo

plus Lore seems like a good fit with the extra card draw for Legolas and healing for Dwarven Shield + Gimli, so maybe there's more than just more Spirit/Leadership cards for them.

also, with the inclusion of Spirit Legolas, that means we have two Spirit heroes with 3 attack and ranged. through in a Spirit Beregond, and you have quite a different style of deck for Spirit whose heroes can attack/defend but can't really quest all that well.

Mirkwood Longknives seems okay.   The thing is that it's spirit, so sure, if you happen to be running Tactics than Rivendell Blades might serve you better.  But if not... Mirkwood Longknives seem a good replacement.  

Don't forget about Fair and Perilous, which adds the Willpower of a Silvan or Noldor character to their attack, which makes Mirkwood Longknives hit even harder.   I hate to say it but...  On Spirit Glorfindel these things are pretty boss.  Quest for 5, attack for 5, and if you drop a Fair and Perilous than Glorfindel hits for 10.

Glorfindel is noldor pretty sure the long knives are silvan hero only (main reason that they are so meh to me)

Glorfindel would need an elf friend to use the knives. The reason it works well with the new legolas is that gimli helps legolas double task. He could help a different silvan hero double task and use the wp and the atk bonus.

Putting Long-knife and Wingfoot on Haldir would be pretty reasonable, although not amazing for the cost. I think it might be best used in conjunction with the weapon based tactics events.

Can't say I look at the new heroes and think "wow!"...but any heroes with in-built readying of other heroes have potential in the right deck. I look forward to seeing what people come up with.

Ive never got it to work well with the existing hero versions, but these two plus core set Aragorn could work well...all three heroes having built-in action advantage has to be a reasonable foundation for a thematic deck.

These new heroes are pretty cool but I don't think they work that well with the older versions...

The new Gimli doesn't work well with Tactics Legolas because tactics Legolas shouldn't be exhausted before the combat phase (unless you had Hands Upon the Bow or Quick Strike) as he is pretty much only used to attack....unless you slap 2 of those new attachments on him and put him to 3 willpower...

I would much rather a Rivendell Blade and Dagger of Westernesse/Bow of the Galadhrim on him instead however putting him anywhere from 4 to 5 attack with the -2 to enemy defense as well rather than just putting him on 5 base attack (also FAR cheaper to play the two tactics attachments). 

Similarly the new Legolas doesn't really work well with the old Gimli as all it really allows you to do is quest and then attack/defend with him when really you want to defend and then attack with him..... this ability is good when used on any hero and the +1 willpower  is such an insignificant bonus especially compared to the +1 attack that Gimli provides with his ability (with readying you can utilize that +1 attack multiple times during a combat phase however the +1 willpower can only be utilized the once during the quest phase unless there are hide tests etc etc..). 

Although simple I like how powerful the readying effects can be (as opposed to to the +1 will or attack) and that you can have multiple in built readying effects from the start of a game before playing a single card. 

There are plenty of cheap readying attachments nowadays which are arguably better than these abilities but by having these abilities inbuilt you can combine them with readying attachments for several actions a turn with these heroes. Legolas's ability is a fair bit better than Gimli's to me because all you have to do is discard a card which for many decks can be beneficial instead of a cost (Elven Light, Galdor ally AND hero, Lords of the Eldar, Glorfindel, Decks trying to empty their actual deck to allow for infinite recursion of a single card: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228800-how-to-infinitely-recur-any-event-in-the-game/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228800-how-to-infinitely-recur-any-event-in-the-game/]etc etc) whereas using a resource to trigger Gimli's ability is always a "cost" as there are not really any "triggers" or effects that occur when you spend resources.

 

I also really like the Dwarven Shield and think that it is an amazing card for dwarves in general not just Gimli whereas the Long Knife is very meh. Silvan hero only means its only good on Legolas, Haldir and Argalad, Celeborn sort of, and its only good on Haldir with readying (And pales in comparison to the  to alternatives you could put on him). We have so few Silvan heroes to begin with that I wish  this could be attached to Silvan characters as well or alternatively Noldor heroes as well. Silvan and hero is just so restrictive and lately so many cards (ESPECIALLY elven ones) are so much more inclusive (Dunedain OR Ranger on Steed of the North, character on War Rainment, Ranger OR Scout on many new cards) that this is somewhat disappointing.

Dwarven Shield and Day's Rising on the new Gimli ensure that he'll get a resource for defending no matter what.  Put Heir of Mardil on him as well, and he'll also ready.

 

I think Legolas' ability to buff Gimli's attack works well with tactics Gimli, since it allows him to quest for three and still be ready for combat. It allows him to quest for four and still be ready for combat if Gimli's in a deck with TaTheoden, the readying effects for both new heroes aren't confined to heroes you control.  More problematic is Legolas' need to quest to use his readying given his 1 wp, since competition is tough for LoV.  I do like the new knives, though.  And since competition is tough for LoV, there's no shortage of strong wp/combat heroes you might want to ready with Legolas ability.

 

Gimli's attack buff doesn't work well for TaLegolas because he won't quest, as noted above.  But again there's no particular shortage of strong wp/attack heroes that would benefit.  Leadership Gimli would work especially well in a dwarf deck with Thorin, taking advantage of his high wp/attack.  With Thorin's resource generation, the cost won't be too high.

I definitely like the new Gimli; as Dalestephenson pointed out, he'll be useful any time you have a hero you want to ready during the combat phase -- a fairly common thing. I'm not sold on the new Legolas though. He combos well with LeGimli, but who else might you use him with? Haldir, I guess, when your threat is low?

I just don't want to commit my 1 wp 3 atk ranged character to the quest if I don't have a sure way of readying him.

New Gimli - means you can quest with Legolas. I know that isn't the best with the older version, but a few WP buffs can fix that. HE also means you can defend with another hero first, then defend with Gimli, just to have the other defensive hero standing again for another attack. Erkenbrand? Beregond? Also, if legolas uses hands upon the bow, quick strike or a great yew bow to attack first, gimli can stand him up.

 

New shield - This means a dwarf can take one hit and take an undefended (if necessary) and make money off the undefended. I'm surprised I haven't seen much about a Gloin deck coming back here. Two resources for one damage?

 

New Knife - The long knife is a weird one because it has the WP that only 2 cost attachments have had so far. The 1 attack and the fact that it is a weapon opens a few windows for spirit to get weapons without having to dip into tactics if they don't want to. Find a simple way for Legolas or haldir to double task and it gets much better. As said before, Fair and Perilous is probably one of the best ways to use this.

So given what we know (3 Aragorns, 2 each Legolas & Gimli) and all the cards available, what would be the best solo 3 Hunters deck?

I'd go with the new Legolas and Gimli with Core Aragorn. You have massive resource acceleration with Steward, easier access to Sword that was Broken, all your heroes can do everything and for card draw you have Elven-light which combos amazingly with Legolas.

I would choose Loreagorn myself. That way you also have easy access to a Lore's card draw ability to fuel Legolas. For solo play, I bet you could build a nice doomed deck out of it, especially considering we are about to get more doomed cards too!

Second for Loreagorn...Gives you access to the card draw to help fuel Legolas, healing to keep the Dwarven Shield trick going, and Master of the Forge to get all of them tricked out with attachments....+ The art on that version is my favorite.

Loreagorn would be my second pick, but I mean, what better fuel for Legolas than Elven-light?

True..But having access to Daeron's Runes, Deep Knowledge, etc. lets you get the card draw without having to spend much either...Not necessarily better than Even-light, but a great addition to it I would say.

That's true. Between Elven-light and King Under the Mountain, your card draw is probably going to be OK without Lore, but I guess I was thinking the threat reset is going to be helpful too since you are starting so high. Also, Wingfoot pretty much gives Loreagorn the same ability as Leadership Aragorn but for far cheaper.

It doesn't. I was just saying I would run Core Aragorn with these 2 new heroes because you get more Leadership resources, and for card draw you already have Elven-light and King Under the Mountain. I will agree though that going trisphere with Loreagorn to use stuff like Deep Knowledge and Wingfoot is nice too. It's just that I am normally very wary of going trisphere in solo unless there's smoothing shenanigans, but that's more of a personal bias.

I ran Loragorn for a few cycles and one of my favorite tricks is to let my threat increase as I hoarded my Galadhrim's Greetings and Elrond's Councils and then trigger his ability and play those cards dropping my threat through the floor.  Council will require some hoops now though.

Man, I know that Spirit Glorfindel is pretty tired, but I do wish that Mirkwood Long-knife was Silvan OR Noldor so it could go on him...Seems like such a good fit that I wonder if they didn't make it Silvan only specifically to keep it off of Glorfindel.  Que Sera....There is always Elf-friend I guess, Though probably a bit inefficient as a combo.  Still be fun to get him all buffed up, quest for 5 w/o exhausting, swing for 5, Drop some progress with Asfaloth....

Yeah I can't stand that they made it Silvan Hero only. Plenty of people in the past have shown disappointment at attachments that are only useful on a single hero (or two), other than the rings which should be as restrictive as they are. 

Most fans of the game seem to prefer attachments that are good on a range of characters but provide a slight boost if placed on the character they "belong" to.

Snowmane is a great example, still gives the same effect but just doesn't take up a restricted slot if placed on Theoden. Same with Herugrim actually, same ability on anyone but is cheaper when you play it on Theoden. Captain of Gondor is great in that it can go on any warrior character, the Aragorn attachments are also great that some of them are great on any character but especially good on Aragorn or provide an additional effect if placed on Aragorn. Plenty of attachments p[er 

Baffles me when they release a card like this after all the backlash they see on the forums when they generally release cards like this. Only the Rings should be this restrictive.

i too like Herugrim and Snowmane.  there's also Asfoloth in that as well.  but i wouldn't really say that Mirkwood Knife is baffling.  one, it's not a unique item from the lore that is understood to be own by a specific person.  also, on the other hand of the argument for restrictiveness of attachments, i see people often complaining about how literally any hero can become the Steward of Gondor

 

for Mirkwood Longknife, i think it's also paying it forward.  sure, it doesn't have a bunch of targets now, but i'm sure we'll get more options later on (maybe even in the Harad cycle itself)

Mirkwood Knife is good on most of the silvan heroes, if they have Light of Valinor as well.  Too bad the Noldor usually hog that attachment (though to be fair, LoV really *should* be on a Noldor thematically.)  I don't like tying attachments exclusively to a particular hero, but this one doesn't and tribal attachments are common enough, if not Noldor/Silvan distinctions.

 

This makes two attachments for Noldor and Silvan that can't go on the other, though to be fair the two Silvan attachments are more exciting and also unshared (Bow of Galadhrim vs Star Brooch and Steed of Imaldris.)

It's not like the seven were made for Dwarves. That's just the number Sauron gave to them. 

 

The One Ring is special, having been made to control the others. The Three are special, as they were made in secret away from Sauron's touch. The other sixteen were general purpose.

Legolas, Leadership Gimli and Skyward Volley is a fairy nice combo. Use Skyward Volley after dealing shadow cards but before resolving enemy effects to do 2/4/6 damage spread across 1/2/3 enemies and then use Gimli's ability to ready Legolas so he can still attack and place progress with his ability if you are running the tactics version.

Edit: Skyward Volley also works well with King under the Mountain and Spirit Legolas's ability.

The more I think about Gimli, the more versatile and awesome he seems, especially in multiplayer. Being able to ready any hero on the board at such a critical time in the round is going to be so helpful. And the fact that he is sentinel makes him able to pretty reliably pop his ability any round you need it. Like if a player can't handle an enemy they have engaged, Gimli can defend it, and then ready any ranged hero on the board to help kill it. Or if everyone is good on attack and defense, Gimli can still ready that one player's Galadriel or that other player's Beravor that didn't get to use their exhaust ability yet this round. 

 

Finally, his ability is once per phase, not once per round. So for those annoying quests that have stuff attacking you in the staging step, you could potentially use his ability multiple times a round.

If we're being picky, LoV should only work for Glorfindel and Galadriel (and it'd be useless on Galadriel). No-one else in the game has been to Valinor. Well, the wizards as well. Point is putting it on Silvan heroes is about as thematic as putting it on most of the Noldor heroes (which is to say, it's not).

Yeah, the new Gimli is really great; readying any hero during the combat phase is going to be nice in a lot of decks.

 

I'm not so sold on the new Legolas, unfortunately, but I think I've figured out how to reason about his ability: you're essentially discarding a card to get to use one hero twice, with the flexibility of instead holding Legolas back as an attacker. For instance, let's say you're running Elrond, Treebeard, and SpLegolas, and it's the early game. What you'd really like is to get double-duty out of either Elrond (so he can defend something) or Treebeard (so you can use his Willpower-boosting ability if needed but still have him ready to smash something). At this point in the game, you don't really need Legolas' 3 atk--you'd much rather use one of the other heroes a second time--so it's kinda like getting two copies of a high-threat hero for 9 threat (and a card discard). Then later in the game when you've got your LoV and Unexpected Courages down, you can just use Legolas for his 3 atk. He's flexible that way.

> Imagine for a moment how the game would be different if Lore Glorfindel wasn't trash.

to be completely fair, he's not though.

 

he just had bad timing.  he showed up at a time before Elrond, which doubles his healing potential.  with heroes like Beregond, starting at 30 threat or higher for Journey Down the Anduin isn't a complete death sentence for your ability to finish the quest.  and with things like Favor of the Valar and the valour keyword, having a high threat in general isn't the terrible fate it once was.

 

but by the time a lot of these amazing pieces that could help fuel his ability and mitigate his high threat were out, we already had Spirit Glorfindel, one of the most broken heroes in the game.

 

i see a lot of excitement for Dunedain Remedy, which granted heals free the first time and is not limited to once per round, Lore Glorfindel starts the game with that ability.  and in a cardpool where threat doesn't matter as much as it did in the core, compared to Spirit Glorfindel, Lore Glorfindel has the same stats plus a usable ability, whereas Spirit Glorfindel just starts the game with lower threat.  yes, it's amazing for secrecy, but like i said: threat isn't what it once was.

> Imagine for a moment how the game would be different if Lore Glorfindel wasn't trash.

 

I wouldn't call him trash myself.  But it's a problem when his spirit form is FAR superior by any objective standard.  If I need a low-threat hero, Splorfindel is on that short list.  If I need to splash Spirit, Splorfindel is on that short list.  If I need a rider for Asfaloth, Splorfindel is on that short list.  If I need a solid quester and/or attacker, Splorfindel is on that short list.  Lorefindel rarely makes any of these same lists.  Aside from his high threat, his healing ability is just too weak and expensive in almost all cases - especially since the Warden came along.  

 

I'm not a crazy advocate of errata, but just for the sake of discussion, I think Splorfindel would benefit from a simple update:  Any time he is committed to a quest, raise your threat by 1 (eliminate the exhaust requirement).  LoV would still be an amazing card and useful for him, but Splorfindel would no longer be able to escape his high profile - a point which is specifically thematic.

 

A good question for everyone here is:  Can you think of a new event or attachment which could specifically give Lorefindel a bump and make him more competitive with his spirit counterpart?

 

Perhaps an event:  Until the end of the phase, after you trigger a card effect that heals any amount of damage, draw 1 card.  

 

This is off the top of my head, feel free to poke holes in it.

While I can objectively critique the quality of art, especially in a comparative context, please try to remember you're talking about the hard work and effort of real people.  As one coming from an artistic background, the art choice on this card is far from awful and calling it such is demeaning to the artist, however you rank it among the current pool of card art.  

 

I implore everyone to please keep this discourse civil and impersonal in its criticisms.  Thank you.

It looks like the artist has never drawn a human being from life before.

Well, Glorfindel is an elf :3

> I'm not a crazy advocate of errata, but just for the sake of discussion, I think Splorfindel would benefit from a simple update:  Any time he is committed to a quest, raise your threat by 1 (eliminate the exhaust requirement).  LoV would still be an amazing card and useful for him, but Splorfindel would no longer be able to escape his high profile - a point which is specifically thematic.

I stopped using Splorfindel since he seemed to find his way into most of my Spirit decks; this is the exact house rule I have been using to reintroduce him to my decks, and so far I've been pretty happy with it. The interesting side effect is that LoV no longer has to go on Glorfindel--whereas before he would always be the best recipient, now Elrond, Rossiel, Elladan, and a host of others all make equally good choices, depending on the situation.

Id take him if he added 1 threat when he committed, but never had to exhaust as the benefit.
