Anyone who hasn't heard this show, make sure you do it is pretty good and gets steadily better as they go on. The addition of Jared for example has brought some much needed card synergy expertise to the show to augment Brain. With so many personalities on it there is some that are sure to grate but I think they do a great job, I recommend this to "most" people.

Im a little behind on listening to all of these, but I can recommend them to people!

 

 It is a decent length podcast and the guys are a laugh! They are pretty fair on their card reviews and dont mind admitting if they were wrong about a card in the past! It is refreshing and honest!

 Also a fan of the cat who occasionally shows up! Star of the show! Go Misty!

I will fully admit I was wrong if someone can prove to me that adding three progress tokens equals the valiant act of virtually the entire organized militia of Rohan charging across the fields of their allies to honor an oath their kings of old once swore upon, losing their king (and almost the closest thing they have to a princess) in the process and decimating a substantial portion of what national defense they could maintain!

I welcome all challengers!!! All of you I say!

I meant you and Jared have some pretty good incite to the card interactions. The others are entertaining.. but nearly all the useful information comes from you , and now also Jared.

The cat is surprisingly quite often in the podcast, e.g. you can hear her (?) in the latest episode in the background.

cat should get more air time.. do not feed her/him b4 the show so the puss is all up on the deck during the cast so we can hear the meows!

I certainly appreciate the compliment, but I gotta stick up for the other guys. They are far more knowledgeable about this game than myself. I think, going into this, my role was always somewhat of the perspective from someone who doesn't understand card games as well. The interactions I've seen all four of the other guys come up with is incredible. Mitch is a master of building synergistic decks, Andrew comes up with card combos I've never even remotely thought of, and Brandon somehow manages to make cards I thought were garbage look like cards made of solid gold. Jared, of course, does all of that and then multiplies our skills by 20 or so. I like to think that what I bring to the show is, like I said, the perspective of someone who is learning all of this as he goes, plus I'm big into the actual lore of the story, so I like to really look at the flavor of the cards.

As for the missing cat, we haven't heard her in awhile! Mitch and I have animals running around the house that I usually try to edit out of the recording because they're more annoying in the recording than they are cute. I'll make sure Brandon knows that the fans are missing the sixth co-host.

Some Cardboard of the Rings trivia: the cat you occasionally hear when Mitch is speaking is Fenri [http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/8365/img0123ar.jpg]s [http://img715.imageshack.us/img715/8365/img0123ar.jpg], whom would be the kitten you hear during Episode 22.

I've been a fan since I first discovered it a couple months ago. I've been catching up ever since. LotR is my first ever card game and if it wasn't for this podcast I'd still be pretty overwhelmed by it all. Listening to you guys discussing each card has been invaluable in my learning how to look for synergies, play combos and what to include in a deck build.

You know what I'd love though? A newbie section. A 5-10 minute portion of each episode where you guys explain and discuss core concepts in card games. Like draw advantage. What is it? How is it useful? Which spheres lend themselves to strong card draw? Which cards are good for card draw techniques? A lot of these concepts I've had to find out for myself and hearing you guys go over each concept supplemented by examples of how you'd build and play your decks would be awesome.

Can I offer one critique? Give Andrew some ADHD medicine before each show. There's no doubt he's clever but he's Mr Tangent the flow-breaker at times. You can tell when he starts to get bored because he starts to crack the jokes. Most of them are funny, but they can be pretty interruptive.

Apart from that, two thumbs from me. Keep up the great work, guys.

I think that's a great idea, Xib. I started the exact same way with the podcast and the game. My only real experience beyond LOTR was the Xbox versions of Magic The Gathering, which I primarily picked up just to finally learn the dang game.

I'll bring your suggestion to Brandon. I know we're looking for good discussion materials for future recordings, and I think this is a great way to start. Please feel free to bring up more ideas and suggestions for items we can talk about!

Downloading it now. I haven't listened to all the episodes just yet (they're all downloaded), but I'm working on it. Hopefully the cat makes a quest appearance in this episode.

 After some technical difficulties, Cardboard of the Rings makes their triumphant return in Episode 24, We're All Out Of Chicken [http://cardboardoftherings.com/2012/04/22/e24-were-all-out-of-chicken/], featuring guest-host Brev!

I caught up on the last few episodes while traveling the last few weeks. Unfortunately, I was traveling in a noisy motorhome, and it pointed up the problem I've mentioned before; Andrew is too quiet. He might as well have not even been there much of the time, because I couldn't hear or understand him. Please tell him to SPEAK UP and not sort of mumble and almost whisper like he does a lot. PROJECT! And Brandon should still be closer to his mic source, but at least the tone and delivery of his voice cuts through enough, unlike Andrew.

Great content and interaction on the podcast, but it's a shame if everyone can't be heard well.

First of all, lightdarker did not play in the Long Dark youtube game.

Second, they were very aware that they messed up rules-wise and checked in with everyone and asked if we still wanted to see the video…we said yes.

Third, you're being kind of harsh, the point is entertainment as much as anything.

Thanks for the defense, Narsil. Glaurung is a frequent voice in this community, and he/she is quite noteworthy for having a strange, ethereal ability to piss everybody off.

As a more generalized response, we do not claim to be masters of the game. We do not claim to be experts on this game. I'm assuming that's what you meant by "a lotr Duty," at least. You know what we claim to be? A free podcast that everybody is free to listen to -- or not. We welcome criticism and we welcome people to call us out when we make mistakes. But you know… overall this is a free broadcast that asks nothing of its listeners that they don't want to give already. If you don't want to listen, don't. If you want to call us out for some mistakes, please do it. I would love to know what we did wrong so that we don't repeat it in the future and give other people bad information.

An ineffective route, however, is to write a ridiculous rant that escalates yourself into some sort of glorified throne of rules knowledge. Don't call us names for getting it wrong, show us what we did wrong so people can learn from our mistakes.

I am aware that this response is nothing but feeding the troll, but I guess my hope is that OTHER people, other BETTER people, in these forums and on our Facebook group, are aware that we totally welcome criticism. All I ask is that you treat us like normal human beings when you do :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Good post (as opposed to the badly written rant above).I've only recently started played Lord Of The Rings LCG, after some friends introduced it during one of our group gaming sessions. I've been going through all the podcasts at work since I saw this thread, and really enjoy what you do (often having to supress sniggers at work as I listen on headphones). Sometimes I get useful insights from the 'casts, sometimes spot errors (which are usually picked up in the next episode), but overall, just appreciate some fun input for a game I really enjoy (that also helps work pass by!).

Keep up the good work!

What happened here is partly a cultural problem. In some countries, being harsh is a norm. I think I know what I'm talking about being from one of those countries.

Anyways, even the more "socialized" people on this board have been quite harsh in the past which is a shame. And starting with myself, I have to say my responses to those have not always been exactly "sophisticated." It would be nice if people tried harder making this board a "better" place.

I dont know why some people are complaining about a few mistakes. can anyone honestly say they haven't accidentally missed a few rules and card effects in their games? especially when the board gets really busy with cards.

i've been following the podcasts for a while and i think they are really good. i think it's better that they're not "professionally" done. they talk about the game, go off on a tangent sometimes, have a laugh, and make the odd mistake, just like us.

the youtube stuff is worth a watch, but i would be disappointed if they totally replaced the podcasts. i'd much rather have it on my headphones to listen to while i'm doing other stuff

…dont listen to those critics, lightdarker!

the mistakes are alright

When we play, its common to get rule changes introduced by the quest card wrong or overlook them (like Hunt for Gollum, when to reveal that cards? How many now? ). It happens all the time. sometimes I wish they would include a summary card where all the game changes are shortly recapped and when they happen…

 Thank you for the kind words, everyone. I'll be sure that everybody at COTR drops in here to see what great fans we have!

For the record, this is Brian posting, and Brandon and I are usually the rulebreakers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Mitch, aka, thelightdarker, is our rules guru and keeps us all on task. So none of the negativity should have ever been directing at the Mitch King. It's all me and Brandon. In fact, to celebrate this series of posts, I think I'm going to recommend that he and I record a gamer together and break every rule possible. I plan on using Pokemon cards.

You're all great!

 Seriously. This is a great program EXACTLY because it's natural…read have errors, mistakes, using time on suddenly appearing subject etc. How boring it would be if it would become a 100% proff radios how / YouTube show with rehearsed scripts. If that ever happened the show would loose it's soul and the popularity drop to down below zero! This isn't a audio version of the rule book or a rule cyclopedia, it's entertainment when it's best. Guys coming together talking about the game and making the mistakes everyone else except perfect-Glaurung-I'm-so-great-and-everybody-else-but-me-sucks-at-this-game-cause-I'm-THE-master-guru-expert *gasp* is making. Casual, relaxed, funny, great.

Well, not much said that haven't been said already. Just wanted to make my voice heard in defence of you guys and your great work.

So in short, people at thecardboardofthering please don't stop!

Glausung, please do!

while there are some shocking errors in these play through, as would be expected if you ever listen to these guys card evaluations :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png], Still.. I would expect Glaurung to make just as many of not more, as he is a solo player (so no one ever checks on him) that claims extremely high win ratios and even uses a single deck for all scenarios AND uses his own ban list (no Beravor, no tracker etc etc) I would like to see him post a game.

A thought about making videos:

Trying to keep the running time low + not wanting to take up too much of the other players' time ---> quick decisions ---> moving through phases very quickly  ---> inevitable mistakes

Yep, I made a couple innocent mistakes out of tiredom (tallying each round at the beginning, not the end, of the refresh phase, and once I forest snared the chieftain I completely spaced placing shadow cards). Hooray for being able to add annotations to videos!

yeah it is pretty funny… especially when 50% of all the stuff they do is playing incorrectly. These guys just cheat.. not that i think they are malicious about it… they just do not understand the rules. This isn't us being rude, or mean.. it is just a fact watch there games yourself and you will see. You correct them on the youtube account and they delete it cause they do not like being told how badly they play.

 You guys totally nailed it. We're so afraid of criticism and someone letting us know that we made a mistake that we delete the comments. We are scared!

Sarcasm aside, we welcome the criticism. I really do mean that. None of us claim to be perfect at this game, and none of us has claimed that we are the end-all experts on its rules and playability.

What I do despise is your antagonistic approach to the situation. The two of you have a notorious ability to make people feel pretty sh*tty with your comments. Rather than using your -- and it pains me to admit this -- pretty impressive knowledge of how this game functions to help people develop their strategies in a friendly way, you attack and insult. Your stupid little disclaimer comments in your signature doesn't mean you aren't being a ****, you're just making an excuse for yourself.

I personally don't know what Glaurung's comment was on YouTube, and it wasn't me who deleted it. I can't speak to it, but based on every interaction I've had on here, I have no doubt that it was a nasty comment designed only to hurt, not designed to provide constructive feedback for us. And frankly that's good enough for a reason to delete it. I welcome both of you to continue listening to the show and watching our videos if you want, but don't expect us to accept your feedback in the same manner that we accept it from others. We don't owe you anything, and coming at us with the attitude that both of you use just causes us to act out of anger. So congratulations, I guess you got what you wanted. You've managed to piss us off! I guess you win!

To the rest of the community, and those of you who take a look at the videos, please don't let anything I've said here discourage you from letting us know when we make a mistake. Yes, sometimes we miss text on a card, but I assure you it is a mistake likely prompted by our desire to produce a quick, clean playthrough and video for you, and not an intentional decision to try and cheat. Mistakes will continue to be made -- several times we've reversed decisions we made on cards because we read them incorrectly, I myself do this all the time!

Please continue to let us know if we goof up. We want to play these scenarios correctly. And as a final message, I don't want anyone to think that we have tried to elevate ourselves to some sort of godlike status. We just make a podcast and some videos. I firmly believe there are people on this site and others who have more knowledge about this game than the five of us. It's entertainment; we're not absolute experts and we're not the final word on anything that happens with this game. All right, that's enough feeding the trolls.

Happy gaming! Episode 30 coming soon!

## 74 [TheLightdarker on July 19, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62056-cardboard-of-the-rings-the-lotr-lcg-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=661118)

First of all, I agree with everything that Brian (FallenTurtles), wrote in his post.

Second of all, Glaurung - I was the one that deleted your comment from YouTube, because as soon as I read it, I had a very difficult time resisting the urge to just come out with it and once and for all to tell you to go f*** yourself. I'm glad I didn't, but as soon as I had deleted your comments out of irritation, I wished I hadn't - once my initial reaction subsided, I would have much rather written something like I have now, so in that way, thank you for coming to this thread and giving me a second chance to express myself in response to still more snarky, antagonistic comments.

You say that criticism makes people better players, and most of the time, I would agree with you; the problem, however, is that you are not a constructive critic. Leaving a comment that says "can you even read???" is not constructive, nor does it make anyone a better player. It's nothing more than a thinly veiled personal attack directed toward me or the countless other individuals and forum posters that you have directed your "criticism" toward. Your other comment, mentioning that I did in fact overlook the "response" ability on quest card 2B (I mis-read it as Forced), was actually constructive - I had made an assumption, and stand corrected. However, when you and Booored suggest that the people responsible for producing this podcast and the videos don't "understand how to play the game," purely because of simple mistakes like this, that just comes off as malicious and ignorant, and generates ire toward the both of you.

Have you ever stopped to think that maybe it would make for a boring video or podcast if there were frequent or long pauses to process every possible piece of information, or to read every single card verbatim? Have you ever stopped to think that some of us don't want to dedicate the amount of time and effort necessary to ensure that everything is perfect? I have not committed every single card in the game to memory, and there are plenty of scenarios I haven't played for months - deal with it. Neither the podcast or the videos are scripted or rehearsed (nor will they be), and therefore, mistakes happen. I would love for either of you to release a recording of one of your own gameplay sessions, or to put out your own podcast, just so you might begin to understand that they are different than posting on a forum - you cannot easily edit your content. If we mispeak on the podcast, or don't take the time to look up a rule, it's in the interest of keeping the running time within reason (the podcast already tends to run two hours long), and it's more important to us that we create interesting and engaging material (your mileage may vary), than to get everything perfect; plus, not every co-host has as much time to dedicate every other week.

If we get a rule wrong, it isn't because I, or any other co-host has some sort of mental deficiency, and it isn't because I, or any other co-host, doesn't "understand how to play the game." Mistakes happen. Criticism is helpful, and welcome, but the garbage that you and Booored consistently, incessantly post in this forum is rarely constructive, especially so far as anything related to COTR is concerned. As much as I appreciate every single person that listens to our podcast and/or watches our videos, I would welcome the opportunity to never have to read so much as a single additional post from either of you two.

By the way: all of this was written in haste, so you'll have to excuse me if I made any mistakes.

- Mitch

What was that…. ".. then he gets off and your hosed" ? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:D I had a really good laugh there. 

I really enjoy your podcast and the insight you give for all those cards. To err is human, to forgive is divine. So forgive them for their harsh criticism and please continue your podcast and the videos (I have to watch them, at least one of them).

Glaurung, I would never say this under "normal" circumstances because I know how hard it is to learn a second, or third, language. However I will say this to you because of the nature of your strong comments. Learn the language before you use it!

The Cardboard of the rings podcast rocks! I neither want a sterile nor a rules fundamentalist game podcast.

Stop feeding the Trolls and the only thing remotely funny in this discussion is that Mitch and Glaurung are sharing the same profile pic…

 Seriously CotR crew. You do an awesome job. You are great entertainer. Just ignore unserious people like those two creeps. There has seriously been wasted enough time and effort on those two than what they deserve. Just do like most of the other nice loveable human beings here at the forum do and ignore anything they say. And please, by all means, delete anything they ever post anywhere you can do it…that would help a lot of people much more than reading their destructive degenerating critique. You get to grow with the critic from those who love you, everyone else doesn't matter one tiny iota. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I have enjoyed the podcats and videos scince the beginging(yes this is Morbid or Mark L. if you prefer)The reason i like them is because you are just fans of the game. If  this was being done by FFG themselves, i would maybe expect the negativity. I enjoy learning the scenarios and rules WITH you, so please keep all the content you do coming and i apprecieate your time and effort.

Thank you for the podcasts and youtube posts. I love that each person on the podcast has a different style of playing. That brings a different view point to the player cards. You guys see things that I will never see, and I enjoy learning from all of you. Please keep up the great work and continue to ignore the silly negative and nitpicking from others that don't appreciate what you do for an awesome game. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Glad to hear that you've enjoyed them, and thank you very much for the feedback! I've been away from the video production scene (and my LOTR LCG playing has dropped off considerably), since a few months ago - details to come in Episode 38, which should be live sometime soon - but in the meantime, it's great to be back, and the new series has been a blast to make, so far. As soon as Matthew gets back in town from out of state, we'll be churning out many, many more!
