Hi guys,

just a question:

may I use the two cards Gandalf Ally and Gandalf hero

in the same deck?

You can have them in the same deck but you will only be able to play Gandalf ally if Gandalf hero is dead... So basically it is a waste of space on deck....

well, unless you are using the allie for a purpose such as flame or arnor

I don't understand...

if you use flame or anor you can use the ally Gandalf... how? just to increase the attack points of gandalf hero?

or there are other ways?

can you explain me better...?

tks...!

ok, so the allie costs 5, which is a pretty high cost for any card.  and for flame of anor, the higher the cost, the more attack, so you could use the allie purely to get more attack with flame of anor.  it would work, but I personally would rather just use a card that I can actually play.

ok all clear now... and I agree with you. the allie gandalf is great in this game where the threat increase so quickly.

if I would continue to use the hero gandalf... any other idea to reduce threat? (I use Galadhrim's greeting...)

Elrond's counsel, Smoke rings, Galadriel (Spirit hero), Aragorn (Lore Hero)...

Island Amid Perils if you run Silvans at all.
