Lately, I am into Caladra decks. I was hinking about starting the saga (again) and lost my thought to which boons I'd pick.

With Caladra in the discard and Prince Imrahil on the table; would it be leagal to permanently attach a boon to PI?

What happens in the next game? Caladra still in play, paying to put PI in game. Has he still his boon card (as an ally)? Similar question: Plaing with Legolas hero, giving him a boon then switching to the ally version. Will that ally always enter play with the bonus attached??

So, as I can see this, there would be a problem Permanent boons, as they can only be attached to a hero at the start of the game and PI ally (and Legolas ally also) cannot fulfill this requirement...

You could attach Permanent boon during a game when Caldara is in discard and PI on the table, but that boon would not be re-attached to him at the start of the next game.

But, I think it would be legal to attach Permanent boon to PI ally when Caldara is in discard, switch to PI hero in the next game and re-attach that boon at the start of that game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You could even switch lately to another version of PI hero from upcoming The City of Corsairs adv pack and still keep that Permanent boon then :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] :)

Thanks for reminding me of reading the rule book! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also, if you ended the game with Caldara in the discard pile (so Imrahil could be a hero), you could not use Caldara again in the campaign.  She would be added to the list of fallen heroes.
