Hi,

For the cases below should I include the 3 heroes in the random process to determine which hero will be the prisoner? 

Case1:

During setup 1A, if one of the encounter cards is Caught in the Web a hero will have it attached when the "When Revealed" effect on side 1B comes up.

Case2:

During setup 1A, If one of the heroes is exhausted as a result of one of the encounter cards when the "When Revealed" effect on side 1B comes up there will be one hero exhausted.

Thanks for your help.

Yes you should include them. In this game everything is written, either on rules or on cards. So even if it is weird that a hero already caught in the web is captured it can happen in the game (or with Frodon ^^).
