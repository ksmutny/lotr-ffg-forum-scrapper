But apparently had very limited quantities and sold out very quickly. Just got out of their vendor area and they were completely out of stock. Got my flame of the west though and about to take on the seige of annuminas in 15 minutes!

Sorry for the troll headline

Wow, all very good. Argalad is certainly very, very good. All that hoopla about the text alignment meant people really started to believe he would damage himself.  Interogation is just amazing for a trap deck. I will have to think more about Battle Fury. And it is surprising to get healing in Leadership, and quite an interesting one, too.

And many thanks.

 

And Argalad seems a decent combo with Haldir. I mean he can "quest" with his attack, which is easier to boost perhaps, after staging, and hit an enemy that Haldir then more easily finishes, or?

Not sure what to think of Argalad. I like the Remedy, specially wince it's the second non-lore healing effect. Battle-Fury is a good idea that could take the place of Quick Strike. Interrogation is INSANE!

And the rest of the cards are: Courier, Marksmen, Robin, Hithlain, and?

> Not sure what to think of Argalad. 

Really? Just reducing threat by 2 after staging is decent. And the only think you need for that is to have one enemy of threat 2 or more, which is almost a given. And if not, if the quest is really enemy-so-light, you can always quest with him for 2 as well. Just one Silvan Bow makes him attack strength 3, so the vast majority of enemies get their threat nullified and damaged.

> Battle-Fury is a good idea that could take the place of Quick Strike.

But you have to have an engaged enemy, or have Dúnhere, basically (who is not a quester). And then you need Spirit to get an extra questing action. I am not sure if this is good, really. Glorfindel probably the best target as a quester/attacker, easily ranged, too.

Battle-Fury seems to be most useful for heroes who have some form of readying dependant on being committed to the quest: Aragorn (Le), Snowmane, Wingfoot, etc. I don't think it makes Quick Strike obsolete though, since QS can be used after enemy engagement and Battle-Fury can't.

Battle-Fury will probably be most useful with Tactics Eowyn.

Argalad is good with a readying card on him. Shame he's not a ranger or he could use Wingfoot.

You can quest with him for 2, then if you ready him, you'd essensially quest for another 2 using his abilty.

That's 4 in Lore. Nice. His overall stats are ok, and I really like his ranged keyword.

 

Dunedain remedy is a cool design but meh as a card. Good to see it as a option for healing in leadership tho.

 

Battle fury: Glorfindel anyone? There are some other nice options, but he just popped in mind first.  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

 

Really diggin Interrogation. Great design & theme! Good card: scrying & discard!

Battle fury with tactics Aragorn pretty well too.

I quit reading the cards and started scrolling through the comments to make sure this was brought up.   We spend a fair amount of time trying to figure out what he said and we never once considered they would shift the text due to the art!  

 

I love the new hero, and can't want to bring him into the Anborn+Sword-than+Wingfoot murder combo, and am now going to finish reading those cards!

Elven spear is another good option for Argalad.  It almost acts as a Protector of Lorien at that point, discarding cards for "will power".

Just as Protector can also act as Spear with Fair and Perilous: interesting.

Argalad, Thalin, and some Spears of the Citadel are going to do good work.

Several strong, fun cards in this pack.

 

The announcement article said:

> You'll also find the new Dwarven Sellsword (The Drowned Ruins, 83), a new Hobbit ally, and a couple of cards that may allow you to traverse even these strange and deadly tunnels with fewer than three heroes…

Strider is the only card in this pack that specifically references number of heroes. I like this mechanic, so I hope there's more support for it in one (or both!) of the remaining packs.

FFG articles always do this, sadly. They say "a slew of new cards" or "a variety of new cards" when referring to 2 cards and "a couple" when talking about 1.

Well, we do get 3 Striders in this pack  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I wonder if it would be more appropriate to call him "Dwarven Sellaxe"?

Whilst Strider is a very good card for its second ability (I have certainly run decks with no more than five characters in play for most of the game, if not the whole game), the less than 3 hero support seems quite feeble so far, and I cannot see many more cards coming that way in the last two packs.

 

That Sellsword looks more like a businessman to me.

Interesting as that card looks, is it just me that thinks the art's a bit off?

Seems like a solid pack. Really like Battle-Fury. Nice effect, and costed well.

With the release of Argaland, are there any heroes left from Middle Earth Quest?
