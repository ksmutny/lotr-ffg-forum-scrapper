Hi All. I am hoping you can help.....

Can Arwen use her ability to discard a card from your hand to add 1 resource to a Noldor hero‘s resource pool at the same time Cirdan discards 1 of the 2 cards he draws at the beginning of the resource phase? Ie. can the same discarded card be used to trigger both actions?

Cheers,

Wow... that's a good question! Between the time Cirdan gets his second card and his forced ability, I wonder if you can Arwen's action right after, because usualy forced abilities occur before actions...

But if you can, this could be super fun and useful! Triple use of Elven-Light!!!

No.

If it were a response to a card being discarded from your hand (like ally Galdor), then that would work, but in order to trigger an action by discarding a card you need to choose to discard that card to trigger that ability. You can't trigger it when you are forced to discard by some other effect.

PocketWraith already nailed it, but to put it in a different way..

 

Cirdan: Draw 1 additional card at the beginning of the resource phase. Forced: After drawing cards at the beginning of the resource phase, choose and discard 1 of those cards.

Arwen: Action: Discard a card from your hand to add 1 resource to a Noldor hero's resource pool, or to Aragorn's resource pool.

 

Cirdan's ability happens at the very start of the resource phase (or at 1.1 in http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf], if you prefer, where you will note the substep to be red, not green). To pay the cost for Arwen's ability -- "Discard a card from your hand to..." -- you need, a. an action window, b. a card to discard in your hand. The Cirdan-discarded card cannot fulfill this, as it is no longer in your hand by the time you hit the action window.

True, but the reason I put it the way I did is because even if there was an action window there you still wouldn't be able to do it for the reasons I stated.

I wasn't saying you were wrong; just trying to help others. Some rules questions require appeal to action window considerations, some require appeal to cost payments, response timing, etc. If it were simple, there wouldn't be a popular subforum on the topic! But a lot of questions can be resolved through clear delineation of what you're trying to do, and I just wanted to list out the steps above.

**** shame! I was hoping i had hit upon a cool little combo. Thanks for clarifying.

Cheers,

Yeah, the idea was cool...

It does combo with Bilbo's ability, so if Bilbo were on the table and Cirdan was in the first player's deck, he'd draw 3 cards and discard one.

If only Bilbo had real Hobbit stats (like at least 2 questing...).

As alluded to above, get ally Galdor out too and draw a total of 4 with one discarded! Who needs hero Erestor, right?
