# [[Warden of Arnor] Give me deckbuilding challenges](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240464-warden-of-arnor-give-me-deckbuilding-challenges/)

I imagine a fair number of you have at least seen my blog even if you're not regular readers:

https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/ [https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/]

 

Here's something I've had in mind as a possibility pretty much since I started the blog and figure now is as good a time as any to do it - I like doing deckbuilding challenges, but I'm not especially good at coming up with interesting ones to do, which is where you guys come in.

 

I'd like to crowdsource some interesting ideas for deckbuilding challenges I can do if you have them. They can be whatever level of specific or vague you like. You can restrict the card pool I use (progression-style, minimum purchase, random or specific selection of packs, whatever), stipulate using specific cards or combos, target a specific quest or just ask for a working deck that fits the other conditions. Just try to make them interesting.

 

Obviously depending on how many suggestions I get I may or may not be able to do all challenges people give me, but for each challenge I do I will put a post on the blog talking through my deckbuilding process and then have either a written play-session report or a video of me attempting a quest with the deck. If I'm doing a video for a given challenge I might actually just stream it, though finding time to stream may be difficult for me over the next month.

Oh, and of course I'll post in this thread to let everyone know when I've done a challenge.

 

So if you can think of any deckbuilding challenges you'd find it interesting to see someone attempt, please post in this thread and I'll see if I can get it done!

RNG all 3 heroes and a quest. You can play on sleazy mode (full encounter deck, start with 2 resources per hero). No Songs, no Steward.

I enjoy the fact that you make a point of including lesser-used cards in The Line Unbroken, generally including each card at least once. Here's a suggestion: Randomly choose heroes (pick 3 out of 5, or else 2 out of 3 and choose the last hero). When you build your deck, at least a third of the cards in the deck (17 in a 50 card deck) must have a RingsDB popularity of 1: http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Sort=Sphere_Type_Cost&Popularity=1&PopularityOp=eq [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Sort=Sphere_Type_Cost&Popularity=1&PopularityOp=eq]

 

It won't be an especially strong deck (though there are some decent dwarf cards in that list), but I imagine that this will present some tough deckbuilding choices and result in an interesting, unique deck.

 

Edit: Alternatively, you could have half your deck consist of cards with a popularity of 2 or less: http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Sort=Sphere_Type_Cost&Popularity=2&PopularityOp=lteq [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Sort=Sphere_Type_Cost&Popularity=2&PopularityOp=lteq]

What fun! I miss the deckbuilding challenges we did a few times on the forums, this reminds me of those.

 

Okay, here's my challenge: Defeat A Shadow of the Past without using any Lore, Leadership, or Spirit cards.

Build a deck with only Warrior heroes and one copy of each ally with the Warrior trait and win Battle of Pelennor Fields or Helm's Deep with it (doesn't have to be a solo game). Hall of Beorn lists 40 such allies spread across neutral, tactics, spirit, and leadership.

That's easy. Tankagorn would have, what, 15 from his toys, 12 from the useful Signals, 3 Unexpected Courage. Then probably Weapons and Armor for Beregond. And Glorfindel and his toys.

I've thought about doing this sort of thing before. I think I came to the conclusion that the best letter was G. But that was a while back and the card pool has grown since then.

> Try to construct as many viable decks as you can from the whole card pool without reusing any cards.

 

We recently played through the Core Set and Shadows of Mirkwood like this (what we actually did was use only the cards we had, which meant 3xeverything + some extra core set cards). There is just about enough for this. It was really fun. I wouldn't like to do any of the other cycles like this though.

I picked this and a challenge suggested on the Warden of Arnor facebook page as the first two suggestions to try. Here's the blog post discussing my deckbuilding process: https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/2017/03/02/deckbuilding-challenges-no-attachmentsall-attachments/ [https://wardenofarnor.wordpress.com/2017/03/02/deckbuilding-challenges-no-attachmentsall-attachments/]

I'll be streaming my attempts to actually beat a quest or two with these decks this Sunday, 8pm GMT, at www.twitch.tv/pocketwraith if anyone's interested in watching.

Well, those games were... interesting. Turned out a bit tougher than I expected, maybe I should've picked some easier quests. I think the decks could've performed better with some better luck on the encounter deck draws, and perhaps also some more considered play on my part - decks with weird restrictions like these ones need to be played a bit more carefully than decks which are just built to be straight up powerful.

As far as I know there isn't an easy way for me to divide up the twitch VOD, so I'm thinking I'll just export the whole thing to youtube, but I'll try to find the time tomorrow to go through and note in the description when each separate game begins. Thanks to everyone who came and watched, or who watches on youtube once the VOD is up there!

I forgot to actually link that VOD here. Here it is. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0chQH9pi3o&lc=z13nudlj2oyajz2ef23bjzkxdm2ddfql1]

I will be getting back to some more of the proposed challenges hopefully soonish (though some of them are proving harder to build for than I anticipated), but for now, this Sunday I'll be streaming my attempts at Seastan's hero auction [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241829-the-middle-earth-hero-auction/]. The challenge for that was more in the bidding than actually getting the deck to work, but it still should be interesting if anyone wants to watch.

I've chosen this as the next of these challenges I'm taking on. I had to allow myself a little leeway on the words 'A' and 'The' because otherwise I actually would've run out of cards I could use, but I limited it to two cards (3 copies of each). Blog post and RingsDB decklist:

Still taking suggestions? I'd love to see a deck that uses Sam Gamgee and Nor am I a Stranger to enable him to use Herugrim, since he gets a bonus to Willpower and Attack. I guess it would work similar to just putting Elf-Friend on him and then using Fair and Perilous, but I just love the idea of Sam using Theoden's Sword to tear up the battlefield.

Well, more difficulties than I expected but it worked out, and worked against the Nightmare version as well! Definite luck of the draw issues, it's not the most consistent setup, but it can work out just fine sometimes.

Exporting the VOD (and the VOD of me taking my solo campaign through Passing of the Grey Company afterwards) to youtube now.

Look out for the next stream in two weeks time!

EDIT: And, done. Worked out great, as I was confident it would, though I did talk through how things could potentially have gone wrong for me. Trying it against the Nightmare version of the quest, on the other hand, was very much a failure. Interesting for me especially since that's the first time I've played Nightmare Mount Gram, and I guess it makes sense that the Nightmare version is more likely to screw you if you try and circumvent the intended mechanics. Though I wonder if we'll reach a point somewhere down the line where it will be feasible once the card pool expands a bit further.

The stream VOD appears to have split itself in two for some reason, but it is right now being exported to youtube.

I built many decks with them. Or at least the scout and the timely aid that I couple to a very good tale to get big allies very fast. I build only one deck with the wanderer (and only 2 since today, sorry): http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5585/best-deck-at-1-hero-for-solo-mono-sam-gamegie-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/5585/best-deck-at-1-hero-for-solo-mono-sam-gamegie-1.0]

I agree with this kind of challenge :). You will probably end on something like http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4880/elrond-gandalf-arwen-undomiel-for-the-strongest-solo-dec-3.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4880/elrond-gandalf-arwen-undomiel-for-the-strongest-solo-dec-3.0]

We can say this in others words: try to find as many decks you can (or one new deck) that can defeat escape from dol guldur nightmare or battle at five armies nightmare or encounter at amon dun nightmare. Those three are the hardest scenario I know so it will accomplish the same that ask you to find good decks :).

Can you make two solo decks with the following:

 

Deck 1 

Sam

Idraen

Eowyn

 

Deck 2

Legolas

Treebeard

Pippin

And make sure to use spirit Pippin ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Beat Journey Along the Anduin using Gandalf, Elrond, and Treebeard as heroes. You'll have a starting threat of 40. If that's too easy, do it on Nightmare :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

EDIT: Realized there are two decks with that lineup published on RingsDB. So, perhaps it's not too original or it's already "solved". But I suppose you could do it without looking at those decks, or using a different build altogether.

As Gandalf Elrond are the bassics of the best deck I know (with Glorfindel or Arwen for the third hero) I don't think I would be so hard to defeat, nightmare or not, journey along the Anduin. And I know what I'm talking about since Journey along nightmare is the scenario I play the most in solo in all the games (like 300 times may be). If he don't do this one I can do it by myself.

That may be so, but adding Treebeard adds significantly to your starting threat and gives you no direct access to spirit toys apart from Gandalf's and Elrond's limited multi-sphere abilities. It seems to me that Glorfindel and Arwen both contribute critical missing elements to a Gandalf + Elrond build that Treebeard just doesn't provide. While I doubt this is by any means an impossible task, I think this 40-starting-threat build has still got some interesting challenging elements to it, and I'd be interested in seeing how people creatively get around those problems.

Since Gandalf have all sphere it is pretty easy to play a lot of cards with imladris stargazer and wizard pipe. With some elrond counsel and double back 40 will not be a huge problem. Especially in journey down the Anduin, where threat is not a major problem. It is not like you are playing return to mirkwood or the nin-eil-eipth :). Those can be a little bit more tricky.

Gandalf/Elrond/Treebeard against Return to Mirkwood would be a sight to see.

Let's make that the challenge, then!

The big problem with taking Gandalf/Elrond/Treebeard against Anduin would be surviving the Hill Troll at the start, the rest of the quest wouldn't be particularly hard I don't think (more so in Nightmare). Return to Mirkwood on the other hand would be a constant struggle not to threat out. I'll probably give both a try, though it might not be for a while.

With that lineup you can technically defend and kill the Hill Troll on the first turn as long as you draw into Shadowfax, Lembas, or Quickbeam, which doesn't seem hard to pull off. Return to Mirkwood seems like more of a challenge while not being impossible. Nin-in-Eilph might end up being an even tougher challenge, but it's been a while since I played that one so I can't recall.

Good luck. I'm thinking about doing it, in nightmare, as a challenge to myself :).

make a pair or triple of good rohan and gondor decks that works with each other.
