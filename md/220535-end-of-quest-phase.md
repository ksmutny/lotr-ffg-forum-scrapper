At the end of the quest phase what happens to the characters I've committed to the quest? Do they leave the play area? Thanks.

Being commited to the quest is just a state. Nothing change otherwise.

I don't know what you call the play area, but nothing say that they have to "leave".

Thanks for that. I'm clear on it now.
