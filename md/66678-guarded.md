 If you play an encounter card that says "Guarded"on it, do you ALWAYS have to draw another encounter card and play it on top of the "Guarded"card?  I always do that.  Is that correct or am I screwing myself?

Also, what happens if the card I reveal is a SECOND consecutive Guarded card?

Yes.  Please read the rulebook P.24 "Guarded"

I have run into the situation where the second card is also a guarded card and I just simply draw two more.  I basically keep drawing until I get non-guarded cards.

 

What is even worse is when they have "surge" and you could wind up with 6 new cards arriving in the staging area very fast.

 

Another variation to your problem is when I draw cards as part of the "setup".  They will have text on them that say, "One damage to any exhausted character" or "-1 willpower for this encounter".  I ignore that text because we aren't in the questing phase, in fact, we are still prior to resource and planning.

 

Am I doing any of it correctly?  No clue, but it seems like the right thing to do and makes sense.

Yes, since there is no exhausted character at setup, the encounter will have no effect. If the encounter card says "-1 willpower in this phase", its effect will have ended when you start your first turn.

 Thanks for the clarifications. :-)

If I draw a two guarded objective cards (or three, etc.) back-to-back I play them as if they are clumped together and draw another encounter card until it is an enemy (which acts as if it is guarding multiple objectives) or a treachery card (which is resolved according to its text). The rules seemed ambiguous to me so this is how I play drawn objective cards until something clearer is ruled from FFG or someone changes my mind. cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

This is covered quite clearly in the rules, page 24: "If another objective card comes up while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place the 2nd objective in the staging area, and use the next card of the encounter deck to fulfull the original keyword effect."

So the sequence is:

1. You draw a guarded objective.

2. You draw a card to guard it but this is also a guarded objective.

3. You draw a card to guard card (1) - enemy/location/treachery

4. You draw a card to guard card (2) - enemy/location/treachery.

Each guarded objective needs its own guard.

What I really want to know is when exactly you can claim a guarded objective.

For example, if an enemy is guarding it and then is brought down during an engagement check, does that automatically free up the objective for claiming?  Or do you actually have to defeat the enemy guarding it to claim it?  Same thing for a location...do you free up the objective for claiming once you travel to that location, or do you have to fully quest through the location to claim it?

The rules are exceptionally unclear on this.

## 9 [dalestephenson on March 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66678-guarded/?do=findComment&comment=3234614)

Until the enemy it is attached to is defeated, the objective is guarded and cannot be claimed.  Until the location it is attached to is explored, the objective is guarded and cannot be claimed.

Seems quite clear to me the rulebook.

"An encounter card attached to a guarded objective is dealt with in the following method, depending on its card type:

Enemy: The enemy leaves play, either by being defeated or as the result of a card effect.

Location: The location leaves play, either by being fully explored or as the result of a card effect.

Treachery: The treachery’s effects resolve, or are canceled. (Treachery cards are immediately triggered when they are revealed.)

Once all encounter cards attached to a guarded objective are dealt with, the players can claim the objective in the manner specified by its card text."
