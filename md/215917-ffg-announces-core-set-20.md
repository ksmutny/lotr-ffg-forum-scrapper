Or maybe not, because of today's date.

Saw the title, thought to myself "really??!?!" And a split second later I thought "oh, duh, April 1", but decided I had to read this anyway just in case.

Frankly, it wouldn't be the worst idea.

Second edition of AGoT was impovement over the first one in every aspect.

I'm bored enough at work to actually attempt to make this a conversation.   

 

I really wish they would make a Companion Core box that fills out the play set for any of the non-3x cards from the core, but then also include 2 more threat dials and 3x of certain cards so you can build more than one deck.

 

Some cards that are top priority:

Gandalf

A Test of Will

Hasty Stroke

Sneak Attack

Valiant Sacrifice

 

Other cards might just be 3x of some of the low cost allies.    

 

What do others think of this idea?

 
 
John, what kind of improvement do you want out of a 2.0 core?

I've thought about this as well. They could even include just 1 scenario in the box, ensuring that die-hards who already have 3 core sets will go out and buy it too.

As someone who likes to keeps many decks built at the same time, I fully support this idea. I would like a 2nd edition of just the Core set as well.

What do you hope/want to be different in a Core 2.0?

> What do you hope/want to be different in a Core 2.0?

 They should :

1- add 1 to every stat number on every card, but...

2- substract 1 from every threat cost of each hero

3- replace all the ''once'' words by ''twice'' for all Action desciptions

4- reduce the cost of all non hero cards by one (all 1 cost cards now would cost zero, and cards that already cost zero wouldn't be discarded after being played)

5- finally, errata test of will to give players a choice between canceling a when revealed or a surge effect from an encounter card

Besides that, no more changes would be needed.  :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

What improvement, you ask?

For the top of my head:

-balancing/reworking overused staples/underused unstaples;

-clear and consistent wording for card effects with the sight for the future;

-better balanced quest with less favor to certain number of players;

-ideally - 3 copies of each player card per set.

I definitely agree with the reworking of cards that are only used initially due to lack of other options.  Like several of the reworked cards brought up on the Create a Card thread.

 

Ability templates should be a set in stone thing for this game - and all of their games - but for some reason they love to change the wording/order of things but still mean the same thing.  Unless you are talking about a game reboot however, changing cards from the core isn't going to do much to solve this issue.  They should implement it immediately though to make future cards consistent - though we know that is unlikely to ever happen.  

 

The designers definitely seem to have learned a lot as this game has progressed and I would be interested to see how they could modify the core encounter quests to scale better with multiple players.

 

I am actually on board with FFG's reasoning for their inclusion of 1x and 2x cards.  It allows them to create a more diverse card pool from just the core - yes, at the cost of consistency.   But since they do this will all their games, that's why I think at the very least they should sell a completion-ist's core that is either 3x of everything like you want for a higher price, or just to finish out the place-set of the non-3x cards in the core without the tokens, etc.

I didn't play AGoT, but from what I heard/read the first edition was in a worse state "gameplay-wise" than LotR is right now. Even though there are some mechanics/things in general I would like to see changed, I don't think it would be worth the work FFG would have to put in. Mainly this hits "old" Things and Cards, as the Designers really got better with time. Bilbo is a great example. Extremly over costed (threat wise). They are never gonna erata him, but in a reboot Things like this shouldn't happen, Designers should have noticed that his threat is to high for +1 Card. Or mechnics like secrecy, that never really came out great

 

The most interesting part surely would be what to do with the quests, as I think the way they work shouldn't be changed (AGoT didn't really Change mechanic mechanic wise, did it?) So they could Keep 1.0 Quests playable, what would be great for 1.0 Players, who at least could Keep the quests, even if they have to reboot their Player Cards.

 

Last Point: The coreset should have better Card Distribution. AGoT 2.0 and Warhammer: Conquest had pretty good cores afaik and there weren't to many Things you couldn't use from 3 cores.

I'd love to see them release an "alternate core set" to live alongside (and compliment) the existing core set. It would include copies of the 1-of and 2-of cards from the original core set, but also a brand new set of 3-of cards that serve similar roles to the existing core set's 3-ofs. It would include 3 new quests and could serve as an alternative starting point for new players (and probably a better starting point, honestly).

 

Buying both cores would give you a sizeable (but basic) set of cards to start from, six quests, 3 copies of each card, and enough counters and tokens to play 4 player.

I have been saying from the beginning that the reason Tactics gets shorted in built into the framework of the game:  You need to quest every turn, but you don't need to fight every turn.  Furthermore, the general threat rule of threat = WP + AT + DF + HP often means that tactics heroes get penalized for having good AT and DF, even though the can only use one per round (barring readying effects).

 

I would like to see some sort of change to the framework of the game so that if you have an enemy engaged with you could arbitrarily make it a "siege round" or "battle round". I wouldn't mind seeing a single "combat" value that would apply to both AT and DF.  That way you could make it a "combat round" instead.

 

Also, spirit got too much of the color pie.  Spread it around.

 

Obviously these concepts would need to be playtested.

 

Finally,the core set make up of AGoT 2 is fantastic.  And if they did the same thing with a new LOTR I would preorder 3 core.  (As it is I am using proxies.)
