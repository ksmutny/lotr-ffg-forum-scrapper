So, what happens when a player puts three Wandering Tooks and three Song of Earendils in his deck?

 

He can take tons of threat from people, allowing them to play Secrecy cards.

If he pairs this with the Lore Aragorn, he can take threat from people until he is at 49, and then "pop" Aragorn to return to his starting level.

All of this is possible because both the Song of E and the Wandering Took are unlimited, and this "infinite" combo gets far better/worse when others splash some blue and put the Songs/Tooks in their decks as well.  Then everyone can pass threat around ad nauseum.

Would you like to play a Secrecy card?  Here, let me take all your surplus threat.  Now, take it back so I can play one… and so on.

We played a few games with all players playing those two cards (and one playing Aragorn), and it made almost everything easier.  Plus it allowed us to keep our scores very, very low.


I do believe that one or both of these cards needs some attention, if only to free up future card design.

Thank you,
J
