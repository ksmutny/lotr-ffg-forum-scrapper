# [Heroes you haven’t tried yet](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/)

## 1 [GrandSpleen on March 9, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3244294)

I was looking at the list of available heroes, and I’ve done a pretty good job of using most of them at some point or another. Here are the heroes I think haven’t really given the time they deserve. How about you?

Argalad. I have built decks with him but never played them.

Eomer, leadership. I’m not that enthusiastic about his ability.

Fastred. The threat part of his ability seems attractive. As for staging area attack, when I build those decks, I do so with the intention of avoiding attacks. I don’t really want to devote a hero slot to a “just in case I have to engage” strategy.

Folco. He is essential for some decks I have used on my own in OCTGN, but it seems not to count unless the hero hits the table with other players, for me.

Kahliel, I haven’t made a harad deck that I’m happy with yet.

Spirit Merry... I always use the tactics version 

Na’asiyah. Someday...

Quickbeam. Just because he’s n ew.

Tom Cotton. Failed hard in my campaign when I tried to use him! I like the idea though...

I'm using Argalad for my narrative campaign series on my blog, and I quite enjoy him. His ability is deceptively powerful, even without readying.

For LdEomer, I've got to admit that I like him less than the other staging area attack options. That said, I did make a pure solo deck with Eomer, Fastred, and Galadriel that used Herugrim and Nenya to swing for insane attack into the staging area, and that deck was just fun to play.

I love both Fastred and spirit Merry - although I've only ever used that version for a thematic pelennor deck.

Other than that, the heroes on your list are all on mine too. I haven't really used LdImrahil much either - I think I need to give him a chance.

Fastred is a good option on a bad mechanic. You can still engage an enemy just to lower your threat by 2 you know ;).

I don't understand your point about Folco. I'm using it as a 4 threat hero for secrecy hobbit decks because all that stridder or "sneak attack to Prince Imrahil" options are indeed cute but don't worth the cost.

Since Merry spirit was released I alway use is spirit version. I never get a big use of tactic merry, probably because building mono tactic fight decks don't make me dream.

Quickbeam have already find a great use along Gloin to me. He could ready so many times.

Tom was a real blast to me. I was trying to put some hobbit synergies together since so many times. But they basically only be good for they low threat in secrecy decks and the hobbit pipe mechanic. Now we have a hero who help both to block (Tom himself, can be help by hobbit cloack and staff of labathron) and to attack (with his ability on other hobbits) and with an event to put thing together and enjoying cool entering the game ability (like bilbo). And you have free to play curious brandibuck that can attack for 2 and then quest for 2. Not bad! Tom really work well in my decks.

Thurindir, for sure. It's only a matter of time before I build myself a side quest deck, though. 

Treebeard would have been on my list too, except that I literally just built a fun deck with him.

It's been a really long time since I last played Fatty, too.

I mean I've used him, but only by myself in OCTGN, and I want to use him at the table with other human players with physical cards.

Fasted is one of my favorite heroes in recent memory! Your point about wanting to avoid enemies altogether with a staging area attack may be true, but it's unrealistic. There are a ton of effects in this game that force you to engage enemies. But apart from that, he actively helps you reduce your threat over time which is vital to staging area attack decks.

I recently heard from someone who took a Fastred/Dunhere/Eowyn deck through the entire Haradrim cycle, and I wasn't the least bit surprised.

Now, if you play primarily multiplayer I could see even more of a case for this guy. Without Fasted, you need everyone at the table to have low threat in order to have someone left for Dunhere to attack. With Fasted you just optionally engage something that was going to go somewhere else, then push him back to the staging area in the combat phase.

Someone still needs to sell me on this guy.   I want to like him! So my real problem: it just seems like the Fastred deck is a "staging area attack" deck in name only.  Mechanically it doesn't offer anything unique, no attack avoidance, still have to deal with engagement 'Forced' effects.  

Often I hear the argument "Why should I use this card, when I can replace it with a different card and make the deck better?"  Actually I hear this argument from you on the podcast!

If you're looking to manage threat and defend well, spirit Beregond.  Less threat management sure, but better defensive option (better native stats, better access to defense boosting effects).

If your aim is "kill enemies after having engaged them," Fastred can be replaced.  All he is doing is providing +attack to Dunhere and lowering threat by 2.  The threat is nice, but Beregond seems better. He can apply his reduction to other players at need.  And in general threat reduction is not hard to achieve.  Dunhere essentially starts with a handicap since he's at 2 attack native.  And he has to attack alone.  Any other 3-attack hero would be superior if attacking enemies, after you engage them, is your goal.

If you're looking to attack enemies, without engaging them, Fastred is just an insurance policy.  I guess I'm really only interested in staging area attack as being an alternative to the traditional engage-defend-attack sequence of play (even if it's not realistic for the entire game).

I should also mention that I say all this totally while working on a staging area attack for my Arcade deck series, but Fastred doesn't fit into it (that's not his fault really, he just doesn't do what the deck wants to do).

There is an embarrassingly long list of heroes I haven't played starting with Dain the Ignoble.

## 10 [dalestephenson on March 11, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3245131)

One difference between SpBeregond and Fastred is that Fastred always lowers your own threat, while Beregond lowers the defending player.  He's also reducing by two (always) instead of one (if uninjured).  Still, it's hard to argue that SpBeregond isn't a better choice in most situations, since he has better defensive stats.  Is he also better for a Dunhere or LeEomer deck that wants to kill enemies in staging?  I think that's possible, and if you have the philosophy that card A is better than card B that playing B instead of A can't be justified, then that could be used to not play Fastred.

But that philosophy doesn't fit well with "heroes you haven't tried yet".  If Beregond didn't exist, I think Dori would be a popular hero.  Because Beregond exists, there are practically no cases in which a Dori deck can't be improved by adding Beregond instead.  But it's worth trying Dori, because he can be fun to play.  The same is true for Fastred.  Even if a better deck could be constructed without Fastred, it wouldn't be a Fastred deck.

My favorite Fastred trick with my Black Serpent Fellowship was to defend an enemy for each deck, bouncing his own (weaker) enemy back into staging while leaving the other deck (with LeEomer) with their enemy engaged.  Then in the questing phase LeEomer with Firefoot and Spear of the Mark could take out the staging enemy *and* have the spillover damage take out his own.  Took some setup, but it was beautiful when it happened.

I'm still inclined to favor Fastred over SpBeregond for a solo Dunhere deck, though.  While Beregond's ability can counteract the threat raise each turn, other sources of threat raise, special engagement effects, or low engagement costs can all scupper Dunhere's lone ability.  None of those will prevent Fastred from setting Dunhere up.  (Aside from his 3/3 defense, of course.)

## 11 [GrandSpleen on March 11, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3245215)

Fun side note, I think Beregond is actually the best teammate for Dori! He's fun for tanking early game heavy attacks, then once you get set up later in the game, he becomes a defender in his own right.

Alright, I'll try selling him a bit harder.

1) The Fastred deck is *not* meant to engage every enemy. Only ones with low threat (and therefore likely low attack) so that you can bounce them back and maintain your threat at a low level. Dunhere is still heavily relied upon to kill enemies before they ever engage. The ratio in games I play is probably 2:1 for enemies killed without/with engagement. Since Fasted reduces your threat by 2, you only need to engage an enemy ever other turn if you really want to keep your threat low. With Beregond you'd have to defend every turn.

2) Again, Beregond's higher defense isn't as useful as you'd think because the enemies with high attack tend to have high threat as well, so you don't engage them.

3) My response to swapping Fastred for Beregond and Dunhere for some other attacker is this: weapons. Weapons are as important to this deck as Fastred and Dunhere. By virtue of the deck being low threat and focused on staging area attacks, there are six cards you can include in your deck (3x Spear of the Mark and 3x Dagger or Westernesse) that will give Dunhere +2 attack for a cost of 1. That's huge. You of course also run 3x Open the Armory so you can virtually guarantee you will start with a 5 attack spirit hero that only cost you 8 threat. The second weapon follows soon after to turn him into a 7 attack menace. And since he's spirit you get access to UC to really start tearing up the staging area.

4) Just take a look at the Eowyn/Dunhere/Fastred lineup's first turn: Start with 23 threat. Play a weapon on Dunhere, play a 2-cost 2-WP ally, quest for 6, have a backup defender ready, and attack the staging area for 5. It's just incredible how fast the deck gets set up and how fast it continues to ramp despite no resource generation. It really is a top tier deck.

Alright, you've won me over.  I don't know if I'm going to roll out a deck with him in it anytime soon, but I acknowledge his virtues.

Let's be honest.  This is me here.  Once I can find a gimmicky use for him, he'll be my new best friend.

My list of never-played heroes - Note that I almost never play solo:

Dori - He looks bad and I rarely play any dwarves besides Gimli and Bifur

Eomer (Le) - His ability is very meh, and staging area attacks are less effective in multiplayer games.

Fastred - Similar to Eomer.  If I'm going to do staging area attacks in solo, I prefer to never engage the enemies.

Galdor of the Havens - His effect isn't very exciting, and I'd almost always rather play Erestor.

Kahliel - I kept waiting for more Harad support, but it never really got fleshed out.

Na'asiyah - She's a hero you need to build around, but it's a very straightforward and boring build.

Quickbeam - New, but also doesn't look very good.  I doubt I will try him.

Thurindir - I like the idea of him, but in multiplayer we almost never want to devote a turn to side quests.

 

Other heroes that I've rarely played:

Gandalf, Boromir (T), Caldara, Dain, Hirluin - Too powerful for my taste.  Don't want to be "the Gandalf guy" at the 4 player table.

Bard, Brand, Lanwyn - Their lack of weapons makes me always go with Legolas or Haldir instead.  The new cycle should fix this problem.

Bilbo, Fatty, Dwalin, Oin, Pippin (S), Aragorn (Le) - Any deck that these would fit into, there is usually another hero with the same traits (or same name) that would be a better fit.

Treebeard, Halbarad - Any deck that these would fit into, the ally is usually better.

I love Galdor!  Always happy when I figure out a deck that works with him.  I like Erestor too, but I dislike how he so strongly dictates your playstyle.

Also a Galdor fan. Any time I get to combo him with To the Sea!² is a good time.

He is a cool idea and I really should try him.  I think I focus too much on his mulligan ability and underestimate the potential of his redraw ability.

Try him. And side-quests. Really. 

I play two-player only and Dunedain decks I have are very good. Unique play-style (keep enemies enegaged, side quests, doomed) and suprasingly strong ;).

I'll second the strength of a Thurindir side-quest deck. It can get insanely powerful. I've got a 2-player unpublished fellowship somewhere that was basically a standard Dunedain deck of the "engage all the enemies" variety paired with a Thurindir deck whose primary purpose is to run Gather Information round 1 and use it to fetch Keep Watch. Between that setup, ally Arwen, and Entangling Nets for really big enemies, I had a Vigilant Dunadan blocking practically every enemy on the board without exhausting.

They aren't a good fit for every quest, but in the early game, side quests are almost always worth the turn you spend on them. It can even be worth completing 2 or 3 in a row if you've tuned your decks in that direction.

Against the most difficult games I play it is quite impossible to success a side quest on turn one. You don't have enough willpower, either because the encounter deck put plenty of cards on the beginning and/or because he stop you from using your full power. In that case Thurindir is not very useful and the side quest needed in the early game (keep the watch, the storm comes, the one who allow to draw each turn) doesn't work. I'm still a fan of some side quest but I prefer gather information, who are as usefull on the beginning (get key cards for you mechanics) that in the end (get events that help to stand until the end, like feint or test of will) and even more double back who is essentially a quest more useful on the last turns. When I read you it is like early game allow us to do nice things to get ready for a bigger challenge. It is true sometime, but I more looking after deck who can deal with early difficulties because of what I'm playing against ^^.

I get the feeling that thurindir his quite long to set-up (get gather information for looking for another side quest that you could have looked for on a first place seem not a fast way to setup). It also can be completely disrupted by a "we need to get quick" mechanic. That is why I never really try it until now. But it is among the things I want to do in the future :).

I agree mostly. He's going to struggle against the absolute hardest quests in the game. But for other ones he is quite good. I have started using him with Send for Aid to get a free OHaUH Gandalf, Jubayr, Treebeard, or Glorfindel out on turn 1 or 2. Then play another big ally from hand and start using AVGT.

With Tactics Eowyn you can actually complete the sidequest on turn 1 against any scenario, even ones that start with a lot of threat. You just need to get a bit lucky and start with Grappling Hook.

I too am a Galdor Fan. I like to put Protector of Lorien on him and pass him to another player with Desperate Alliance. Then they can dump their hand and draw a new one!

Since I'm often focuse on the most difficult scenario I never go deepest in this strategy. Who will be your third hero? You are only at 14 so maybe you can even be secrecy, with Glorfindel for example. If you also have a decklist I would be glad to see it.

I'm a galdor fan too, even if I'm only playing it on Noldor builds. I almost discard all my hand during mulligan to find the right cards. Then I easily find a way to discard my hand with Arwen hero, Glorfindel ally, elven jailer and to the sea, to the sea (where I do over discard sometime).

I don't have a decklist at the moment, since I just thought of that Eoywn+Grappling Hook+Thurindir idea. I think in 2 player it could be even more reliable, since each deck could include 3x grappling hook. Then complete Keep Watch on turn one.

Heroes that aren't currently in a published or unpublished fellowship of mine:

Leadership: Erkenbrand

Lore: Bilbo Baggins, Folco Boffin (but I plan on adding Folco to my four 2-hero decks)

Spirit: Lanwyn, Legolas

Tactics: Eomer, Na'asiyah, Quickbeam, Beorn

Clearly more Dori fellowships are needed.

I have 724 unpublished decks on ringsdb. I thought this ripe for some statistical analysis so I put a little script together to count my hero usage. Here are the results:



# of decks Hero # of decks Hero # of decks Hero 144 Spirit Arwen Undómiel 15 Tactics Gimli 5 Lore Faramir 139 Leadership Denethor 15 Tactics Hirgon 5 Spirit Nori 107 Lore Erestor 15 Spirit Merry 5 Lore Ori 74 Spirit Glorfindel 14 Tactics Thalin 4 Leadership Elrohir 67 Lore Elrond 14 Lore Thurindir 4 Spirit Fastred 56 Spirit Círdan the Shipwright 13 Leadership Celeborn 4 Spirit Idraen 55 Tactics Éowyn 13 Lore Folco Boffin 4 Spirit Óin 50 Lore Pippin 13 Lore Mirlonde 4 Tactics Théoden 47 Lore Beravor 13 Tactics Prince Imrahil 4 Leadership Thorin Oakenshield 47 Tactics Boromir 13 Lore Treebeard 3 Tactics Brand son of Bain 45 Spirit Éowyn 12 Leadership Balin 3 Spirit Dwalin 39 Spirit Galadriel 12 Lore Denethor 3 Tactics Elladan 35 Lore Galdor of the Havens 12 Lore Haldir of Lórien 3 Leadership Éomer 34 Lore Aragorn 12 Spirit Legolas 3 Leadership Halbarad 34 Leadership Théodred 11 Spirit Caldara 3 Lore Rossiel 33 Leadership Sam Gamgee 11 Leadership Dáin Ironfoot 3 Spirit Théoden 32 Tactics Mablung 11 Leadership Gimli 3 Tactics Tom Cotton 27 Tactics Beregond 11 Tactics Merry 2 Lore Bombur 26 Leadership Elfhelm 9 Tactics Éomer 2 Spirit Lanwyn 25 Lore Gríma 9 Tactics Legolas 2 Spirit Pippin 24 Neutral Gandalf 8 Lore Argalad 2 Tactics Quickbeam 24 Tactics Háma 8 Spirit Eleanor 1 Fellowship Aragorn 23 Tactics Aragorn 7 Leadership Erkenbrand 1 Tactics Na'asiyah 22 Lore Damrod 7 Lore Glorfindel 0 Fellowship Aragorn 22 Leadership Glóin 7 Leadership Hirluin the Fair 0 Fellowship Aragorn 21 Leadership Amarthiúl 7 Leadership Kahliel 0 Baggins Bilbo Baggins 21 Leadership Aragorn 7 Leadership Prince Imrahil 0 Baggins Bilbo Baggins 19 Lore Bilbo Baggins 6 Tactics Dori 0 Spirit Fatty Bolger 17 Lore Bifur 6 Leadership Faramir 0 Fellowship Frodo Baggins 16 Tactics Beorn 5 Tactics Bard the Bowman 0 Fellowship Frodo Baggins 15 Spirit Beregond 5 Leadership Boromir 0 Fellowship Frodo Baggins 15 Spirit Frodo Baggins 5 Spirit Dúnhere 0 Fellowship Frodo Baggins

 

So it looks like the only (non-saga) hero that I've really never built a deck with is Spirit Fatty. Of course this doesn't track whether I actually played the deck - only that I built it. I think it's still interesting though.

I was initially shocked to see Arwen in my #1 stop but I guess it makes sense. I would have probably predicted Erestor. I am very surprised to see Lore Pippin in the #8 spot since I don't think I use him as much anymore.

I've made the code for doing this publicly available here: https://repl.it/@Seastan/lotrHeroUsageShare [https://repl.it/@Seastan/lotrHeroUsageShare]

I'd love to see the results for other people!

Very interesting!

My top 11:


14 	 Leadership Aragorn
14 	 Spirit Arwen Undómiel
13 	 Spirit Éowyn
13 	 Lore Pippin
12 	 Spirit Galadriel
11 	 Leadership Denethor
11 	 Lore Elrond
10 	 Spirit Frodo Baggins
10 	 Leadership Sam Gamgee
9 	 Lore Aragorn
9 	 Neutral Gandalf

I'm actually pretty surprised to see Elrond and Gandalf so high up, I didn't think they were particular favorites of mine or anything. I think my Path Less Traveled blog series is probably primarily responsible for the proliferation of Spirit Eowyn decks. The rest of the list pretty much makes sense; those are some of my favorite go-to Heroes!

My Bottom 14:


1 	 Lore Beravor
1 	 Tactics Brand son of Bain
1 	 Tactics Dori
1 	 Leadership Elfhelm
1 	 Tactics Éomer
1 	 Leadership Éomer
1 	 Leadership Erkenbrand
1 	 Leadership Kahliel
1 	 Spirit Óin
1 	 Lore Ori
1 	 Spirit Pippin
1 	 Tactics Quickbeam
1 	 Tactics Théoden
1 	 Lore Thurindir
1 	 Tactics Tom Cotton
0 	 Tactics Bard the Bowman
0 	 Lore Bombur

This is really interesting too. Some of these Heroes are just new, so I haven't built enough decks from them yet. Others are primarily multiplayer-focused, so they rarely hit my table.  Still others are frequently lambasted for being bad Heroes, so it's not too surprising I haven't used them much. But what is Beravor doing there? How could I have been ignoring her this whole time? I suspect it has something to do with my propensity to build thematic decks; maybe she has too much competition in Dúnedain decks.

My full list is attached if anyone wants to look at it.

My result was a bit skewed by my practice of saving multiple versions of a single deck.  But the top hero was not surprising to me: Damrod!  I love traps.  Here are my top 10:


16 	 Damrod (Lore)
13 	 Elrond (Lore)
13 	 Merry (Tactics)
11 	 Galadriel (Spirit)
11 	 Pippin (Lore)
9 	 Arwen Undómiel (Spirit)
9 	 Frodo Baggins (Spirit)
8 	 Aragorn (Leadership)
8 	 Éowyn (Spirit)
8 	 Gríma (Lore)

Surprised to see Grima as high as he is.  

At the bottom of the list, there are some 0's, but they are all heroes I have used multiple times.  Erestor, the twins, Gloin...  I used to make and save decks with a different deckbuilder, so those are lost to posterity.  The only one I have legitimately not used is Quickbeam.

And by the way thanks for doing that Seastan! That is super cool.

I thought I found some interesting results in my top twelve:

29     Arwen Undómiel (Spirit)

29      Éowyn (Tactics)

28      Glorfindel (Spirit)

25      Denethor (Leadership)

18      Galadriel (Spirit)

17      Círdan the Shipwright (Spirit)

16      Amarthiúl (Leadership)

16      Sam Gamgee (Leadership)

14      Boromir (Tactics)

14      Éowyn (Spirit)

12      Elrond (Lore)

11      Legolas (Spirit)

 

I was not surprised seeing Arwen, tactics Eowyn and Sp Glorfindel at the top. I build a lot more decks than I play, due to vast amounts of spare time without access to my cards or octgn. Therefore, a lot of my decks ends up being very similar, as I don’t tire of building the “same” deck once each month. This may explain how Amarthiul, a very specialized hero that works “better” in multiplayer, ends up being number seven in my solo oriented deck collection. Another reason might be my love for the dúnedain archetype.

Cirdan is another favourite hero of mine, as is Boromir, Galadriel and Elrond. Denethor and Sp Eowyn surprise me a little bit, as I sort of don’t like Èowyn, and I don’t remember building so much with Denethor. They are really powerful though, which might explain things. Sam is equally surprising, I don’t like hobbits, or leadership.

Perhaps the biggest surprise is Legolas. I find him to be an interesting hero, and use him a lot more than I use le Gimli. One of my favourite decks is le Denethor, sp Legolas and lo Glorfindel. I like the combination of sp Legolas, Elven-Light, Steward of Orthanc and Keys of Orthanc. A hero ready and two cards for one threat! Speaking about Glorfindel, I actually have 6 (!) decks with his lore version. After a bit of research, my Lorefindel decks vary from mono lore to tri sphere, and contain several pure noldor decks. Very interesting indeed. Twelve threat for 3wp, 3atk and 5 hp is not that great, but his good traits helps him a lot. LoV and Rivendell Blade works as good with him as with his overused spirit version. And he has the greatest ability in the world, his name and sphere. Really. In sphere Asfaloth. And card draw. Plus that one game in five years when his healing saves you a game. Everyone must hear about Glorfindel’s greatness, how he “won” a hard archery quest, like Helm’s Deep, for you. It will be worth using him for that moment

I also think Lore Glorfindel is not at all a bad hero.
