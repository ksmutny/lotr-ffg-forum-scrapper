Nice to meet you all, just started looking into this LCG and being a huge LotR fan I believe this would be fun. Is this playable for one and/or two people?

Welcome. Yes it is, in fact this game is playable Solo or Co-Op, with 1 to 4 hands/decks or players (The core box says that you need a second box, and whilst it is helpful, it is not necessary for up to 3 and 4 players)

 

I say hands or players, as even when you are playing solo you can use more than 1 hand/deck. Two handed solo is quite popular as it allows for various card synergies that require more than 1 deck in play.

So is it possible to gather multiple expansions and combine them with the core box and play with that?

Yes of course. In fact, if you want play really, you must play with the most player cards you can.

This is the best game i have never played, and you can play up 4 players (and more if you want)

Pd: from which game is your logo?

Middle Earth quest. I have not played it but I love Elves in fantasy settings and this one looked pretty awesome.

 I was in a similar position about a year ago, trying to decide of this would be an enjoyable game for a Tolkien fan, and had some of the same questions. I took the plunge and am very glad that I did. This is a very absorbing, dare I say addicting, solitaire game that has the additional benefit of being a solid multi-player game that plays well cooperatively. The latter quality is really useful, as teaching others to play a competitive game is often one-sided and can even deter some folks from wanting to learn. However the cooperative structure of this game makes it fun to share with friends.

how much of the game can you solo play?

Hi everyone, it is nice to see so many new players take the plunge. Be warned, however, this game can become a real addiction :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

 

> how much of the game can you solo play?

 

Everything! The game scales reasonably well for 1-4 Players, so all the quests can be played alone. There are many players who play two decks solo, which can be great fun, too, but requires good card management and a bigger table.

 

Some of the quests tend to be very difficult when playing solo, for an example Escape from Dol Guldur from the Core Set. Others then to be even a bit simpler when playing solo. So you can adapt your play style for each quest. When playing two decks, you can try and build decks that share cross-deck synergies which is also a great challenge and a lot of fun.
