Previous round killed the Nazgul, two locations (total of 8 threat) on staging area ... play trained for war and decide to put on questing as much as I can in order to feel safe that I will get the 15 (plus what will be n the staging area) quest points I need to win the quest ...

 

I sum up 31 quest points !!!! and offcourse the snaga scout cannot change the result

As a new player I am a tad lost but that aside, what is this program you have used to make this photo (not imageshack, the actual program you are running)?

This is a platform called octgn with which you can play the game someway. It doesn't contain all cards though and not that fun as the real game. I use it more for screenshots like this or if i want to play a quick game as a break from work. Imagine that even on holidays I prefer to get with me all the packs on my baggage instead of just a laptop with this software
