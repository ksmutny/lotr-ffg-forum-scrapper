In a multiplayer game, do you get the cost reduction of item and armor even if you don't control him? I'm pretty sure, because it doesn't say "when you play . . .," but I wanted to make sure.

Oops. Should have posted this in the Rules section.

TL;DR: Yes, it‘s independent  

I can‘t think of a reason why it shouldn‘t count for everyone. As you said there is No „you“ or „if you Control B...“ in the Text. Just the general Information to lower the cost. It is an „aura“ just like Dain‘s willpower boost for example. Just because you control the hero doesn‘t mean his effect doesn’t come in to play for others, except the text states otherwise.
