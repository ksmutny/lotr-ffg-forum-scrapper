# [forum catagories petition....sign here](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/)

## 1 [richsabre on February 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=589842)

after getting a general approval from the forum this thread has been changed to a petition used to send to FFG to (politely) ask for forum catagories

a very regular user of this forum i, as well as others, know that it gets the most traffic of all the LOTR LCG forums, therefore i think it is in its best interests to keep it as user-friendly as possible

these are the updated catagories which the forum has so far voted for:

General topics

Rules and FAQ

Player content (custom scenarios/tournaments/deckss etc)

 

 

these arent final, but i think they are the best so far,

also personally i think we should have some sort of general discussion area and new player introductions -or use the off topic for that, but if you have any strong feelings for/against them please post so we know

 

update: due to several member opinions i think what most people think we should do is keep the catagories to a minumum so that we can find posts asap, therefore i have made a thread where you can vote for which cats you think best

 

ok so please sign this thread to add to the petition

i will update names here as we get them

I can do nothing but agreed with you !

I'm french and I mainly read the forum for rulings and news so it kinds of bugs me to see sooooooooo many threads about tournaments (which are good threads but really not relevant for me...) and to see that the unofficial FAQ thread is always lost in any other page...

Hope some admin will put good order in it soon...

 

## 3 [cordeirooo on February 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=589938)

There is something similar here: http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/17-lord-of-the-rings-lcg/  [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/17-lord-of-the-rings-lcg/%C2%A0]

Also, the admin there are more active, so it's easier to make 'minor' changes than here.

## 4 [DurinIII on February 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=589943)

I agree with you Rich.  The forum page just has too much different stuff going on at the same time.  Categories (albeit very general ones like you mentioned) are a good idea.  

## 5 [SiCK_Boy on February 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=589954)

I think the main issue is the first page limit rather than categories and sub-forums. If that first page was 3 or 4 times longer, it would be much easier to look up the last week's worth of posts rather than having a first page than can barely hold the last 24 hours.

good point, and going back to my dislke of catagories, a result i would prefer

I think something like this would be fantastic!

I like what you've got. Similarly, I could imagine:

 

Rules & FAQ's

News

Tournaments

Gaming Reports

Custom Cards & Scenarios

Off-Topic

 

richsabre, what do you mean by "variants/player content"?

We could also have a Quests forum, with a subforum for each quest.

That would make it easy to find quest-specific advice, FAQs, play-throughs, reviews, variant suggestions, etc.

It would also make it easier for people to avoid getting "spoiled" by info about quests they haven't tried yet.

What appeals to me about this idea is that as we progress through the quests, we progress through the forums, sharing advice and ideas with other players who are focusing on the same areas of the game.

So, what is our recourse as a community toward seeing something like this become implemented.

i.e. How do we make this happen? lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

That would be this thread then eh? lol I think it would be great to get some sub forums going. I don't come on here as much any more as I did as it's just so bogged down in the latest 'tournament' etc post. Good threads for people interested but not for those like me.

yes or we could always have 3 catagories

BOROMIR

PIPPIN

BILBO

and you post in those relavent- nah im joking that would get confusing

i do think its important that we have a corner where theme guys like me and others can hang out and competative guys like glaurung and tourament masters like juice and zjb(sorry forgot your username hah) can hang, and of course a place for everything in between

## 14 [richsabre on February 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=590716)

ps

actually i find petitions a little snobby and demanding

how about one of us emails a mod and just plain out asks for catagories?

thats if the rest of the forum wants it

which we'd only know by a petition

ive gotten myself into a cycle

must stop

must stop

pps i just wanted to point out how happy i am that this forum isnt really moderated....man ive just had my hatreds of control freak mods re-ignited elsewhere....free speech for all etc etc

see thats the beauty of this forum- you can go off topic as much as you like and not get called a troll- a scatter brain guy like me wouldnt survive if it changed....and i have no idea why im discussing this with myself.....anywhoo back on topic!!

I like the idea.  I also like the idea of a Scenarios category.  It's too easy to lose track of interesting threads when Real Life interferes with consistent LOTR forum diving

## 16 [richsabre on February 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=591074)

I'm for forum subcategories, too. I really like this suggestion:

Rules & FAQ's

News

Tournaments

Gaming Reports

Custom Cards & Scenarios

Off-Topic

 

BUT.. I think with subcategories we all have to try very hard to open threads in the right subforum OR it actually has to be monitored by a forum moderator.

IF they would only grant 1 subcategory I vote for:

 - Rules/FAQ

as previously stated i would rather not push the forum in the way of mods......really really rather not

 i have never agreed with the patronisation (a word?) of forum moderators....not saying all are like this, but ive yet to find a forum as free and easy as here

 

i think it wouldnt need to be anyways, we already have catagories, well 1. but if they were really obvious ones people would get the idea

## 19 [juicebox on February 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=591183)

If there was an option to move old threads to the new categories, that would be excellent as well.

richsabre, are you familiar with how to update your original post (in this thread)?

(If not, let me know, and I can give you a quick rundown.)

I ask because I think you should turn this thread into the official petition. You could update the initial post title (to include something about "sign the petition") and keep a running list of names in the original post of people who sign in agreement that we need forum categories. I hear your hesitancy around "petitions" - maybe it could be called an official request (or something), but I think readers may be more familiar with the concept of a petition (so it might be more expedient). Also, I think it is an incredibly reasonable request. We are not asking for the moon. This site, in spite of its limitations, continues to be the LOTR LCG forum that gets the most action. It would be great (for all involved, FFG included) for the user-friendlyness of the place to receive this small upgrade.

My humble opinion.

hi juicebox

 

no ive tried to figure how to change it but dont actually know how

and yes i think turning this thread is the best way

also i would need some sort of indication about how many/what type of catagories are generally wanted

personally i think your listed ones are good, but somone mentioned quest sub catagories, which im not sure about, do we think this is watering down the mix too much? i dont want to convert the forum into a place where you have to click on 20 pages to get to your destination

also i think if we had more general catagories everything would pretty much have its place and be seen more

I agree with you. I like my list too, and I think Scenario specific categories are too narrow and would create confusion about where to make posts that apply to the game in a more broad sense. So, I think we go ahead and make the proposal for the general categories. I'm normally not this "executive" in making decisions, but these thoughts come from participating in other forums over time. Also, future change is always an option. This would just be a much improved next step in developing the site as it is currently. My thoughts... if anyone has some remarkably different ideas, please don't hesitate to post. This is all very worth the discussion in my opinion and will be a significant investment in the future quality of these forums.

To update you post:

1) The next time you post to this thread, immediately afterwards, return to page 1.

2) There will be an Edit option up in the top right hand corner of your original post.

3) Click on the Edit option.

4) Cut and past the URL from the "edit your post" page and save that somewhere else (a Word document or whatever). (Then in the future, you just past that specific URL back in your browser when you want to return to the page to make another edit.)

5) Once the page is open for editing, you can update the title of the thread and the content in your original post.

Feel free to PM me if you run into any other questions. Wait, are we friend on here yet? We should be friends. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Awesome. Nice work.

Might I suggest adding numbers by our names? Not a big deal right now, but that wouldl help keep an accurate count of how many signatures are on the list as it grows over time. That way, at a glance, it can be seen how many names are on the list. When it gets to a significant number, I think you or I (or everyone on the list) can be encouraged to message the good folks at FFG with a link to this thread and our specific request for forum categories.

 They made a subforum for Massing. Unnecessary if you ask me. They should make one for Rules instead. As most of the posts are rule questions.

The more I think about it, too many different forums is a bad thing. I don't want to have to click back and forth between several different forums to read posts, just because they have a different type of subject.  This forum isn't that busy to require that, and I'd rather have just one forum than too many.  So what would be most useful is to take something that's very particular and gets a lot of posts and give it its own space... which to me mostly means the tournament thing.  There seem to be a lot of tournament related posts here, and those would have a very particular interest (or not).  Of the 28 threads on the first two pages of this forum, 6 of them relate to tournaments.  That's not a huge percentage, but to me that would justify giving it its own space, especially as it will have a limited appeal.  Those who have interest in tournaments can follow the them on that forum.  Move those tournament posts to their own forum, and that would leave everything else very manageable within the general forum.

I also think that fan-made scenarios and custom cards and things related to that could/should have their own forum, only to distinguish them from the official released materials.  In terms of the amount of posts or content related to that, it's not a lot (as compared to Arkham Horror's fan content, for example), but just for the sake of noting that those things are not official (and therefore some may want to ignore them), a separate forum would be useful for them.

The only other thing that would be good is a place to post decks, like this forum: http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/19-lotr-lcg-decks/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/19-lotr-lcg-decks/]

So I suggest only four forums: General Discussion, Tournaments, Fan Creations, Decks/Deck Building

Otherwise, I don't think it needs more than that, and more than that would probably be detrimental.  Rules questions and general product discussion should all remain together in the main forum that gets the most traffic.

The only other thing that would be good is a place to post decks, like this forum: http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/19-lotr-lcg-decks/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/19-lotr-lcg-decks/]

So I suggest only four forums: General Discussion, Tournaments, Fan Creations, Decks/Deck Building

Otherwise, I don't think it needs more than that, and more than that would probably be detrimental.  Rules questions and general product discussion should all remain together in the main forum that gets the most traffic.

 

 

i do agree with you, ive said previously that i dont want to turn the forum in a 20-click-to-get-to-your-destination thing

i think whats best is that before we send this petition we all sort of come to an agreement on the cats we want (this is a great forum and after all and i certainly dont want to be the one who ruins it lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif])

ive updated the op about this

It would seem that many of us are in support of some type of categorization of the topics...promising....but, will it happen?  To be honest, I can't see how anyone who plays this game and uses this board would be opposed to such a change.

Where would Deck Building fit into these categories? I think there has to be an additional category for people to post their decks (text files as well) both for play and for help in modifying.

This is what i enjoy about CardGameDB.com

i think custom card/player content should be modifyed for that.......your point is noted for when we all decide :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

ok so to update what people have been requesting-

 

1.small amount of catagories- around 4ish

2.a deck building catagory or for at least for it to be included in one of the other catagories

3.a place for general topic/theme/debate posts

4.definatly a dedicated rules and faq section

5.definatly a tournament section

6.player creation section

i will post another thread where we can decide

I think it would be sufficient to have 3 sub forums. 

-General

-Player created ( tournaments, decks,scenarios……)

-Rules and FAQ

 

and close the Massing sub forum. I took notice of it months after visiting this forum for the first time.

 I'll sign the petition. Whether it becomes 3 subcategories or 5, doesn't matter to me. But I'm starting to see how useful it would be to split the forums, especially for searching.

It is time-limited, though.  After a while, you can't edit it anymore.  One of the great "features" of this forum.  sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

Yes, because the edit feature is time-limited, I recommend saving the URL for the "edit mode" for a page you might want to return to later for editing.

Here are the basic steps I use:

To update you post:

1) The next time you post to a thread you have started, immediately afterwards, return to page 1.

2) There will be an Edit option up in the top right hand corner of your original post.

3) Click on the Edit option.

4) Cut and past the URL from the "edit your post" page and save that somewhere else (a Word document or whatever). (Then in the future, you just past that specific URL back in your browser when you want to return to the page to make another edit.)

5) Once the page is open for editing, you can update both the title of the thread and the content in your original post.

booored, why so pessimistic?

Also, why so all knowing? Do you have some inside information about FFG's policies around the creation of forum categories?

I mean, why not try this? The future is yet to be written.

If we can collect a bunch of signatures and each write to FFG personally with a request for the change and a link to this thread, at least we've acted on our desire to better the community experience. Sure, we can't control the final outcome, but we can say our piece. The alternative is just not attractive to me.

## 66 [booored on February 13, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=593608)

Hey I did what he asked and bumped it didn't I? Also after you have been on the forum for a few years you will see the level of community management that FFG has.. they produce smick products so it is easy to forget that they have a tiny studio with very small number of employees.. there is simply no one watching.... mostly

## 67 [richsabre on February 13, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60032-forum-catagories-petitionsign-here/?do=findComment&comment=593716)

i think the bottom line here is, whether you agree or not, other forums on here have sub catagories, it isnt asking alot to get them here, and our intentions are nothing but to do the forum good, and i think as some of the original players of this game, we have a duty to keep the forum going and keep it user friendly

 

out of the main posters on here, most have shown support, so i think we are backed by the majority here.....if no one got back then yes, i would  let this drop into forum oblivion

 

i dont want to bump this thread again but this is the point, an important thread like this gets put to the second page within the day, its good the forum is busy and active like this, but threads need more than 24hrs reading time

 

also im not expecting ffg to be reading this, the idea is to send them a nice message asking for their time, which we all apreciate is very precious with all the products they bring out

 

but you have as big a say as anyone else here, and your opinion is noted as a negative to this thread

Well if people say "don't do categories" I say "Don't create 3 or 4 tournament threads per week..."

We all have a voice, of course, but, if we can't reach an agreement with FFG, at least, we have to agreed with each other...

- don't create a thread before you searched your question
- don't create a thread if the topic has already been discussed
- don't create a thread if you can answer an existing thread and the topic is not relevant for every one

Any other "rules" have to be set down and respected

these make sense......... however i would much MUCH rather have catagories and have the freedom to post whenever and whatever, and not have to feel bad. it would also mean mods which i have gave my opinion of

also the search tool here is awful and i like the free and easy manner of this forum, its a nice chilled out place to be......i hate rules.....'down with The Man i say!'

however shiv@n is correct in that eventually people will get fed up of thread knocking theirs down, i mean it isnt just tournament thread, it could also be one of my thematic little debates, that probably doesnt hold much interest but to a few.....and that will start to annoy the posters of more game orientated threads and of course visa versa

I prefer the categories too richsabre, it's just another way to look at it if we can't succeed to get the categories...

booored said:

Well, maybe my english was very bad and I didn't make my point without being rude and in that case, I'm sorry. Or maybe are you trying to make a point showing this forum is not moderated. Or maybe you're just an *** ! But, I don't think I desserve this kind of answer...

Yes, I would be glad to let people do want they want, where they want and when they want, but then, apply this to you and let me try to be constructive and let me say what I want in a thread where it is relevant...

If I may add this, I don't read the tournament thread or anything else I don't want to read (when it is clearly indicated in the title of the thread) but I don't want to look through 5 pages before I find anything relevant for me...

So Yes, I vote FOR the categories, at least, people will write anything they want anywhere they want (in the proper category at least...) and everyone can be happy together. BUT, if it can't be made with FFG, I think we have to self discipline ourselves and be careful with this forum or it will soon be the mess (it is already, no ?)

i think the end point here is no one wants to have their thread buried, and everyone can ignore things that dont interest them, but you cant ignore a page where 75% of the threads arent relevant to you, lets face it -you'll leave the forum eventually, and i dont want this to become a ghost town where everyone's buggered off to cardgamedb or bbg- yes i have seen your signature, and i hate this forum software too, but ive spent a year building up about 1000 posts and several friends on here, so id really prefer it if we tried to better this forum before we give up on it

Candacis, I think that's a great idea. I'll do the same soon too.

rihsabre, I just want to say, if I haven't made it clear already, I'm really thankful you took the initiative to get this topic going. I agree completely that forum categories will enhance the LOTR LCG forum experience exponentially.

So, what if we all follow Candacis's lead and start sending in individual messages making this request? (Also, does anyone have any other suggestions for ways to contact FFG directly?) In the request, we could provide a link to this thread too as evidence of the growing support for the change. Of course, it will be more impressive the more "signatures" we have, but hopefully, that will continue to grow. In the mean time, some other more direct action may feel good.
