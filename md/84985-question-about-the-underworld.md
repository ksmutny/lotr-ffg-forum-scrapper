the rules said "when a location leaves play,any facedown cards stacked underneath that location are revealed one at a time,and added to the staging area."   here the question,when a location with two cards underneath it leaves the play,just choose one and reveal it or reveal both of them

Is this a real question? How are you having trouble deciphering that?  Of course you reveal them all….

Awesome attitude nismojoe!  Seriously, answer the question or don't.  You don't have to insult the guy.

Give a man a fish, feed him for a day.  Teach a man to fish, feed him for life.

Worst use of that quote ever. Seriously where did you go to school? You´re just trying to justify being a deuce.

Ah yes bash on someone for mixing up a word that doesn´t belong to his native tongue. Is spelling correction the best defense you have for your behavior?

1) If english isn't your native tongue, don't attempt to mock someone using it? 2) You didn't misspell the ******, you used a completely different word.  Deuce generally means 2 or the playing card with the number 2 on it. 3) Only reason I bothered to respond that way was because of the "where did you go to school?" comment.  The main point there was a bad education being pointed in my direction when in fact the irony of it all was that you used the wrong word.  I am unsure if deuce has a double meaning in another country.  Like the word *** here means gay and in england or britain or something it means cigarette.  Gotta be careful on this planet with what you say.  Rich, that will NOT result in you getting a free unexpected courage!!!

1) Du er bare et fjols, der helt klart har misforstået idéen med et fælles sprog i det hele taget. (so did you understand when I did use my native tongue? Do I really need to explain why I´m trying to communicate with you in english?)

2) Never said I misspelled it. I said I "mixed it up" which is quite more open to interpretation. Misspell could be one way of interpreting it. Swapped could be another.

3) Clearly you have no problems behaving like an ass to people asking for help. Are you surprised people behave like an ass to you? Maybe even trying to deliberately provoke a response to get you to realize that very few people enjoy, in essence, being called stupid?

4) You´re still trying to avoid the core of the conversation here, which is about respecting other people, who´s only fault is asking a question. Are you going to get around to that ever or are you too busy trying to cover your own assinine behaviour?

5) As far as I´m concerned you owe pcjames an apology (don´t know if pcjames is still watching or cares though)

OK, that was fun but it's time to move on.  I officially declare myself the only person allowed to troll nismojoe for trolling easy questions.  Nothing to see here folks, back to your hobbit holes.

  And now I apologize for my awesome first response.  Had you led off with English isn't your main language, I would not have been so hilarious.
