1.  If you have a hero with the condition attachment "Caught in a Web", can you discard Westfold Horse-Breaker to ready that hero?

2.  Can Westfold Horse-Breaker's action be used to ready a hero of any player, or can he only be used to ready one of your own heroes?

Thank you very much for your help!

1. Yes, caught in a web says "Attached hero does not ready during the refresh phase unless you pay 2 resources from that hero's pool."  It can be readied otherwise, through card effects.

2.  "Discard Westfold Horse-Breaker to choose and ready a hero" means any hero, controlled by any player.
