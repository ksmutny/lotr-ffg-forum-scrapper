What's a card that you've hardly used, that you would like to be able to use more? Have you tried to make it work? Why didn't it?

 

One of mine is Small Target. I like the idea and theme behind the card, but I found it tough to use. I tried putting it in a deck with Silver Lamp. It's still tricky because you need to be engaged with two enemies, 1 of which has enough attack to kill the other - otherwise you aren't gaining much action advantage. Also, it's an event, so it's hard to build around.

 

What are your favourite underused cards?

Being a solo player there are soooo many cool cards I can't even think about using because they aren't efficient enough for a solo game.

Mostly costly (non leadership, non silvan) allies come to mind like Anborn, and Elfhelm.

Oh man, Small Target would totally be at the top of my list.  Such a fun concept, but near impossible to execute.

 

Great Yew Bow would be another one.  The ideal target is Lore Faramir, but his threat is so high and he's out of sphere that it never really works.  The fact that it doesn't work with Bard's ability is a travesty.  Plus, now Haldir basically does the same thing.

 

I might put Strider in that category.  You can kind of make it work, but I haven't been able to make a 2 hero deck that was as effective as a comparable 3 hero deck.

 

My favorite underused card that I have actually gotten to work is Keeping Count.  You need a ton of card draw to make it work, but it can be bananas when it gets online.

I'm pretty sure it does work with Bard doesn't it? Great Yew Bow specifies that it's a ranged attack.

 

Keeping count is another good one. I should really play around with it more. What was your hero lineup?

It does work with Bard, its text indicates that the attack is considered ranged. Great combo with Dunhere because he will then benefit from Bard's defense debuff when he makes his own attack, if needed.

Oh yeah, the fact that Hands Upon the Bow doesn't work is a travesty.  Great Yew Bow just doesn't work for other reasons.

 

My best keeping count deck has been Mablung, Aragorn (T), and Hama.  You are killing a lot and using Hama to cycle Foe-Hammer.  Once Aragorn gets like +10 attack from Keeping Count, he gets Rivendell Bow and can snipe anyone in the staging area with Hands Upon the Bow.

 

I want to try including it with an Erestor deck, but haven't put it on paper yet.

You all are already mentioning some good ones. Palantir is one that I really like and have used effectively, but seldom use. I feel like I always have to pair it with Loragorn but maybe Spirit Merry would work too.

Oh, don't get me started :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Well, if I had to pick just one... Hm...

 

Against the Shadow. The concept is super cool, the execution - not so much. You pay helluva resources to swap the stats of only spirit guys, and that need to be the stats that is most useful during the first hostile phase. I think I'll need to make a pass on it for my rework project.

Ooh, I like that idea. Dunhere is so much fun, but takes a lot of building around to get to work. One more tool in the Dunhere toolbox!

 

I still haven't been able to get Rossiel to work. I've had a few fun decks using the victory display shenanigans, but I still haven't figured out how to make one with Rossiel in it. I always want to use her as a defender, but she doesn't really have enough hit points to be able to defend safely. I end up wanting to splash Tactics for Elven Mail, and Spirit for Light of Valinor, but go mono-Lore so that I can stay in secrecy to reduce the cost of Out of the Wild... and then I switch her for Denethor or something and everything becomes much more focused.

I've noticed in my Rossiel Secrecy deck that Rossiel isn't that important. Her effect of +2 Willpower is occasionally beneficial, but other than that, that Victory Display stuff works fine without her.

Against the Shadow is a nice one. And I would also mention Light the Beacons.

Defending if often tough in this game and the bonus granted by both those cards is tremendous. Sadly I never seem to find the resources to play the cards. Monosphere is a given for AtS and nearly a given for LtB... So it's obvious all those spirit characters are going to quest and thus not be available for defending most of the time.

Those cards saved our asses multiplayer during siege questing but never saw much more regular play.

## 13 [DukeWellington on December 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2566549)

Well on some level you can make any card kinda work, depending on what your standard is for "working", so the cards that came to my mind are underused, extremely fun, but difficult to use consistenly on most quests. There are niche cards like Free to Choose that need a specific effect in a specific quest to be useful. Niche cards just end up losing out to universally powerful cards with effects like card draw and resource acceleration because even if you make Free to Choose work in it's ideal scenario, the standard power cards will often still perform better.

Anyway, top underused cards would be Palantir (by far), Grappling Hook (which I have made work with Erebor Battlemaster), Idrean (again, you can make her work, just wish she were better), Dwalin (most fun I've had in game is making this hero work, especially with T Merry), Ranger Bow (always underperforms), The Door is Closed

## 14 [Authraw on January 1, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2566618)

Ooh, Ranger Bow is a good one. I always plan to do some sort of Gondor direct damage thing with it, but it never seems worth the card slot, the exhaust of the ally is attached to, and all of the resources it takes to play it all down.

For those of you looking to make Ranger Bow work, I had a lot of fun a couple years ago with a Glorfindel, Mirlonde, Pippin deck.  I can't seem to find my decklist anywhere, but I roughly recreated it here: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4048/ranger-bow-target-practice-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4048/ranger-bow-target-practice-1.0]

Follow Me! It's not that I'm itching to pack it into decks, exactly... It's that it's a little mindbending to think of situations where it would be useful at all. For extra points, combo it with my actual answer to the OP prompt, Defender of the West.

Lore Glorfindel, his ability is so so but you dont need healing in the begining so i wished he would have another ability, Also pay a resource in lore today he would be a pay a card i guess.

i've thought about making a thread recently about picking a horribly underutilised card and see if people can build a deck around making it work (not just include the card, but see what it takes to make it live up to its potential)

for me, it's a lot of the leadership and lore-sphere secrecy allies, like Dunedain Wanderer [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Dunedain-Wanderer-RtR], Rivendell Scout [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Rivendell-Scout-TTT], and Ithilien Lookout [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Ithilien-Lookout-TDT]

they seem cool, but they just aren't in the right spheres to make them work easily

## 25 [dr00 on January 2, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2567628)

> Spare Hood and Cloak is another card that I want to use more.

i was thinking about this recently as well, and i think ally Arwen could work really well with it since her ability activates every time she exhausts, not just when she exhausts for a specific reason (like questing or defending, etc.)

if you cycle a bunch of cloaks through her, you could get a bunch of sentinels and/or lots of def bonuses when you need them

it's still probably bad. or maybe needs copies of the cloaks in all the decks to really get it going. another character that activates some ability on exhaustion could probably help too

EDIT so i don't keep multi-posting



> Gamling.  Definitely that guy.

i have 1 copy of Gamling + 1-2 copies of Rallying Cry in my Rohan deck, and it's great in general, but especially powerful with Escort from Edoras to get that boost to questing every round when you need it, especially late game when you have a decent pool of resources and an established board state so you don't mind having to spend 2 every round for 4 questing (which is a great deal though anyway) Edited January 2, 2017 by dr00

I used it in my support deck, utilizing Boromir to ready anybody on the board for 1 threat.

I see the use there, but the problem with Spare Hood and Cloak for me is that it almost always a one-time use, as in this case. There isn't much reason to pass the Cloak back to Boromir.

 

That said, I did manage to build a deck where it bounces back and forth between Lore Denethor and Forlong. Forlong always has extra exhausts to use, and Denethor (stacked with UCs) often ends up with extra exhausts if you see a card you like on the first go. But apart from that niche use, I haven't played it much.

 

> Here's how you do that: Don't Hog the Cloak [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/spotlight-slapdash-spare-hood-and-cloak/]

 

Haha, yes I remember reading that a while back. Maybe that's the treatment all these underused cards need!

Ithilien Lookout is great though, here are some decks that use him to full potential:

I felt the same way for a long time until I built my Aragorn / Arwen secrecy deck:

http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/806/legend-of-luthien-2.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/806/legend-of-luthien-2.0]

 

I built that deck before the new 2-hero support cards came out; it looks like it could use an update.

sorry if i wasn't clear. my only problem was that they're secrecy in a sphere that isn't super easy to make secrecy work. granted, it's easier in Lore than Leadership, but it still totally applies, especially since so many Lore ranger-themed cards that revolve around the staging area, avoiding engagement, being below 20 threat, etc.

i had an idea for a loragorn + arwen 2hero secrecy deck, but it will annoy me forever that its starting threat is 21 lol :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

i suppose it's not the end of the world though, and there are plenty of those 2 hero support cards now that could make it work. i may give it a closer look

Cards I really like but just seem to fall short of being worth the slot are Idraen, Lanwyn, Rossiel, Defender of the West and The White Council.  

## 33 [awp832 on January 3, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2569086)

I suppose when I hear "underused" I think of cards that I feel are stronger than most people give them credit for.  So just because a card isn't unheard of doesnt mean it doesnt make the count, so long as I feel it's still undervalued.  Similarly cards that you never see aren't going to be on the list because well, they're probably still bad.

5   Follow Me!  From everything I've read, the legal play of this card allows for some serious multiplayer shenanigans.  Can't believe we don't see it in most multiplayer Ld decks.

4  Lanwyn:   I thought when we saw the first Ranged hero ever in Spirit that things were about to get crazy.  So far, she has not been popular.  Even less popular than the considerably worse Rossiel hero, who came out at about the same time.

3  Grappling Hook.  For all the Gondorian fire decks or other cards that use attack shenanigans,  not even a 1-of ?   Seems like a bargain to me.

2 Gleowine:  Yes he is used, but he's underused.  1 card/turn for a mere 2 lore resources is just a great value over the course of the game.  He's like the best.

1  Eowyn (T):   4W tactics hero that reduces your threat by 3 and lets you one-shot most enemies, allowing for an easy kill on the first nasty thing that comes around... deserves to be one of the most popular tactics heros.

Not getting into an argument about relative power levels, but I feel I should point out that Lanwyn and Rossiel were released a whole cycle apart.

5: Follow Me could do more if you could choose the first player. But even then, I'm not sure what "serious" shenanigans you're taking about.

 

4: Agreed - we need more support cards around surge, including a way to give a card surge to gain a benefit.

 

3: Grappling Hook isn't repeatable (for good reason) without a lot of effort. The Gondorian Fire decks already dominate the game without it.

 

2: Agreed - Gleowine would probably my top 5 list of underrated cards

 

1: I see her being used a lot.

Idrean has been underused by me because she's always lived in the massive shadow cast by Glorfindel+LoV. With the Dunedain mechanic more fleshed out now, I've used her a couple times for spirit access. I wonder if Spirit Aragorn comes out if she'll ever see the light of day again.

I feel like Argalad is one of those cards that is somewhat underused. Anything that lets you tweak questing after drawing encounter cards is excellent, direct damage is excellent, silvan trait is excellent. I like pairing him with tactics and giving him Elven Spear to tweak his attack for those enemies with more than 2 threat.

 

We just need an attachment like "Ithilien Promotion" that gives a Scout character the Ranger trait :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I want to use her ability in the same vein as Boromir (T), though obviously not nearly as efficient.  There is lots of ways to put progress and move it around to semi-on-command ready her, but getting a lot of defense/attack out of her requires so many other spheres that aren't Spirit.

I remember a discussion a while back that went like this:

 

During the combat phase, you have 4 players. Players A, B, C, D.  Player A is first player, B is 2nd, C is 3rd and D is 4th.

 

Player A resolves his enemy attacks.

During Player A's resolution, Player B uses Follow Me! and becomes the first player.

Player A is now the last player.  When he finishes resolving his enemy attacks, it is now Player B's turn for player attacks.

 

You have skipped the enemy attack portion of the combat phase for Players B, C, and D.

 

I don't remember whether there was a ruling or official weighing in on the legality of this.

that is the idea I was talking about, Grandspleen.  As far as I am aware there was never any official ruling, and the question is still "unresolved".  As I see it, the rules are clear enough, and it works,  unless you're making some sort of exception for Follow Me!'s specific case.   

Grappling Hook:  yeah, you might be right about that one.
Eowyn (T):  I see her not uncommonly.  But I think she's one of the best Tactics heros around, and deserves an even bigger share.

I considered this, but I thought you would just start resolving player B's attacks as he is now first player and has not resolved his attacks yet. But if you're right, I agree that is some powerful shenanigans. Skipping attacks for 3 players is a big deal.

I love the chutzpah of the idea, but I don't see why it would work. I didn't see the original discussion, so apologies if I'm just reiterating previously-advanced points...

 

Core rules, p. 18: "The 1st player then repeats [the 4 steps of combat resolution] for each enemy that he is engaged with. After the 1st player has resolved all enemy attacks against himself, the player to his left resolves the attacks his enemies are making against him, following steps 1-4 in turn for each enemy. If playing with more than 2 players, proceed clockwise around the table with each player resolving all of his enemies’ attacks."

 

It seems to me that if, to use GrandSpleen's labeling, player B uses Follow Me! during A's enemy attack resolution, then B immediately starts resolving his attacks, then we move on to the player on his left, i.e., player C, then D, then back to A if not all of his enemies have attacked. The rules don't say anything like, "Repeat until you've reached the last player"—they say, "proceed... with each player resolving all of his enemies' attacks."

Well, without wanting to derail this thread too much, basically it works like this (simplify this down to 2 players)

Player A is first player and engaged with 0 enemies
Player B is second player has enemies engaged.

Player A resolves attacks made by enemies against them.  There are no attacks to be made, that step is now complete.
Now it is player B's turn to resolve attacks made by enemies against him.  Player B is preparing to do this.  Player B is entitled at this point in time to play cards like Feint, etc.   During this event step, Player B plays Follow Me! and becomes the first player.   Since "Enemies attack the first player" step is complete, enemies facing player B do not attack.  It is the time for enemies engaged with the second player to attack.  The second player is now Player A;   Player A has no enemies engaged with them.   This step is now complete, it is now time for players to attack.   You have just skipped the attack phase of all enemies engaged with player B.

## 45 [pmdoug on January 4, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2570100)

1. Minas Tirith Lampwright

I absolutely love this guy for being one of only two player cards that actually interact with the surge mechanic. He was released back in Heirs of Numenor, and somehow remains the only true counter to surge. He's fantastic: fun art, low cost, and stats so pitiful that they become endearing. But I've only ever included him in a deck with the Palantir (another underused card), using him as fodder for Eomer and Imrahil, or when playing across from a friend using Risk Some Light. I so badly want him to be good. I want this kind of card to supplant the tyrannical rule of Test of Will! He's risky and inefficient, but when he shuts down a card it's the best feeling. But I'll continue to sing his praises, even if he consistently discards himself after mistaking a mountain for a troll. He's like the boy who cried wolf. 

 

2. Lanwyn, Bard, Brand and all the Dale-folk

I like Lanwyn for much the same reason I like the Lampwright. She isn't a direct counter to surge, but she is the only hero that stands up to that most annoying of keywords. I like Bard for his raw power and the fun that can be had by coupling him with Straight Shot or Firefoot. I like Brand because he was there for me back in those early days, readying my friend's heroes and staring directly at the sun. And yet I almost never use them...

The sad truth is that these three heroes have terrible trait support. Scout is becoming a more and more useful trait, so Lanwyn has that going for her. But Dale? It isn't even a real trait. Hey Brand, enjoy all the weapons and abilities that come with being King of the Dale! And then Bard doesn't even share the Dale trait with his grandson. He has the only Esgaroth trait in the game, but at least he has Warrior to make him feel better. 

Being a Dale hero grants you access to nothing, and there are only three Dale allies to muster. I really like the Rhovanian Outrider, but I can't say I've ever used the Ravenhill Scout or the Celduin Traveler. If the next cycle after Harad doesn't visit and/or support Dale, then I'll be very disappointed that this trait was never given a fair chance.

 

3. Thror's Key

Not much to say here. I just love this thing and can't understand why I don't run it more often. Sure, it's not crazy good, but I'm always happy when it triggers (I'm looking at you Outlying Homestead). 

 

4. Revealed in Wrath

This is mainly underused because it's still a rather new card. It also isn't an auto-include general purpose card. But it is super fun to shut down certain enemies, especially when used by Arwen or Galdor.

Lanwyn is actual my most likly hero. I used her in a Lanwyn-Idraen-Theodred-deck where surge is generated by using Ranger Summons. Allies help me to ready Idrean and Theodred provides res. It's a shame that the Ranger of the North do not have a shadow effect like the ones from Massing at Osgiliath.

Sadly, since "attacking enemies" only begins "once all players have resolved enemy attacks", and player B hasn't resolved enemy attacks yet, the combat phase never finishes and the quest ends right there.

I agree with this. Since the phase doesn't end until all players have addressed combat, it seems like combat would proceed to the left until that is the case. In fact, in the worst interpretation, the initial 1st player may have to resolve combat twice if they are to the left of the final 1st player but before the last player.

 

Obviously that makes no sense, and neither does any of these exploits. That being said, I still struggle to find uses for it that justify deck space. I suppose often a Leadership/Tactics deck wants to engage more enemies, and therefore might want to be 1st player during the engagement phase, but realistically there are much better ways of engaging enemies.

 i actually made a very similar deck. i also tried to include Elfhelm when he was revealed since i'd start with 3 scout heroes

i think it needs just a bit more support though. the first and most obvious is having more surge cards like the ranger, but i think a really big thing is just having better questing scout allies for their cost (most are 3 cost for 2 willpower or similar). Snowbourn Scout is a good chump blocker. Rivendell Scout would be great if it was easy to enable secrecy

i really like Greyflood Wanderer in this deck though.

that said, the deck is really great at controlling locations and works really well with Idraen's ability and it might do well to focus on just beefing up your heroes with mounts/Elfhelm and signals and other attachments

I have actually been able to get good use out of Follow Me in my brothers deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3834/warriors-of-the-west-3.0]. That deck really needs to keep at least 2 enemies around in order to do its thing, and more than once I've been able to use Follow Me to simultaneously save another deck from trouble and get myself the extra baddie I needed to help trigger my bonuses the next round. It's actually a pretty good fit for the deck, but it still ended up relegated to the sideboard since I found I didn't really need it if other players had brought Sentinel defenders (meaning I was less likely to have to play some weird card to save the day).

 

That's the closest I've come to getting good use out of it though.

i made an mono-Leadership Outlands deck with a bunch of copies of things that draw 1 card for 1 resource in lieu of Rod of the Steward (Campfire Tales, Follow Me!, and of course We Are Not Idle, since it draws for free)

for a sphere that generates enough resources that a 2 for 1 resource/draw effect is considered useful, i felt it would help by effectively having a lower effective minimum deck. it's clearly the worst of the card draw effects, it's probably the first i'll cut if i find something better, i don't really care too much about being first player (nor do i build anything else around that), but it finds a place

Elfhelm does not fit into my deck. Theodred does a great job and povides spririt resources for trackers, outriders and other stuff. I included 2x Elf-friend and 2x Mirkwood-Longknife to support Lanwyn besides Dunedain Mark. So mostly she has 5-6 ATK besides 4 WIL. http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/34800 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/34800]

All this Elfhelm hero talk reminds me how underused the Elfhelm ally can be. He's pretty nice with any quest that throws lots of Doomed encounter cards at you, and there are a surprising number of quest cards that raise your threat. I might even consider including Mustering the Rohirrim just to pull him in the right scenario (like Nîn-in-Eilph, ugh!). His stats are pretty solid too for either defending or attacking.

I have tried and I feel Mutual Accord doesn't work very well.   It seems like it would be nice but it just requires too many combo pieces to be in play, even with 2 decks dedicated to the idea,  it's not enough benefit and requires a lot of investment (in terms of deck space).

Elfhelm ally is pretty nice.  He's a good value of Theoden (S) is around, and a decent attacking/defending card considering it is spirit.  And his ability is handy, I do like him in a Rohan deck.  Otherwise 4 cost is a bit pricey, usually I would rather have a Northern Tracker.

+1 to this. Free Emery + Sword-thain with the help of Arwen's resource, and then use Caldara's ability to bring 3 spirit heroes for free into the table (Glorfindel, Northern Tracker, Háma, Prince Imrahil, Elfhelm, Rhovanion Outrider, and Jubayr -once The Mûmakil is released- to name some options), all this during round 1

don't forget Eomund

but i agree with you. even with things like Leadership Boromir, Visionary Leadership, For Gondor! (which is only ok on its own)

as someone who's spent a fair bit of time trying to make this work, i think you end up doing is making a rohan deck that works pretty well and has to include 3 copies of mutual accord, then a gondor deck (again, 3 copies), but the gondor synergy just isn't really there yet. there's no discount card for them. there's steward of gondor and L-Denethor, but those aren't really gondor-specific

there's literally no synergy across spheres from Spirit or Lore, so you're kind of stuck with leadership/tactics, which have a lot of great valour options, but in that instance, t-Boromir is kind of pulling more weight than L-Boromir (imo)

basically, it's kind of a mess making a decent gondor-themed deck that wouldn't be better as something else because the gondor theme doesn't mesh well with itself as compared to others. that's why mutual accord doesn't really work imo



> Is there much value in it besides in a caldara deck? I've used it on ally legolas to put Roman warhorses on him, but between narya, hero faramir there are many ways to ready allies seems superfluous.

i think it's strong in decks that have lots of effects that rely on number of heroes (cards reduced in cost by number of certain type of hero, for example, or Pelargir Shipwright who gains willpower for every spirit hero)

i think it's kind of a trap to try to make an ally a hero for some wombo combo. you still have to deal with the fact that you basically paid full price for Resourceful (which isn't a good deal and costs a lot of tempo)

Obviously Sword-thain works well if you get it and/or the ally for free with Vilya.

There's the trick where if you Sneak Attack an ally then play Sword-thain on them they don't return to your hand at the end of the phase which obviously cuts the cost.

I built a shenanigans-y deck around the idea of playing Sword-thain on Ceorl, then giving him Steward of Gondor and Songs so he just becomes a big stack of resources that moves around the table.

If you're playing a mono-sphere deck which uses the relevant Record attachment then in addition to your Sword-thain generating resources you also save a resource each time you play a Record so it recoups its cost and becomes a net gain of resources faster than it otherwise would.

Presumably the Sneak Attack trick works the same with Tactics Imrahil too.

Although you'd need to play Sword-thain during combat phase somehow...

## 69 [NathanH on January 7, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238381-underused-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2575830)

Ah yes, it's a Combat Action isn't it.

Azain Silverbeard and Well Equipped. Not a reliable plan, but it works.

i suppose that would be the living-the-dream-est living the dream play ever considering you need to have Azain to be in the top 5 cards of your deck and THEN have Sword-Thain in the top 2 cards of your deck after a shuffle

Well-equipped isn't too much of a hassle, you just need it in your hand. you could set up one piece with, say, Wizard Pipe, so maybe just get Sword-Thain and Well-equipped in your hand and keep using Imrahil until you pull a dwarf, then finish the combo. don't think it's worth all the trouble though lol

also it would work with To Me! O My Kinsfolk!, but again, it's like a 3 card combo for what exactly? and getting Sword-Thain out for free requires even more cards (as explained above). it's probably really cool and fun when it happens, but i would imagine the encounter deck is running amok while you're waiting for all the pieces

this is why it works so well with Caldara. it makes Map of Earnil cheaper, gives more willpower for Pelargir Shipwright, and gives you another ally from the discard with Caldara's ability, and that ability makes it so worth it cos you're getting some high-cost allies into play for free

i think it's really hard for any other deck to compete with that right now. a mono-Lore deck with Mithrandir's Advice and Scroll of Isildur comes close, but it's probably lacking a few other synergistic pieces

cards that benefit from having more heroes

Leadership

Ingold (+1 willpower if your Sword-Thain target has 1 resource)

Legacy of Numenor (+1 resource)

Rear Guard (still not worth it though)

Tighten Our Belts (+1 resource)

Tome of Atanatar (reduces cost down to a possible 0)

Tactics

Book of Eldecar (reduces cost down to a possible 0)

Forth Eorlingas! (if Rohan and if you need another hero for this attack)

Spirit

Inspiring Presence (they have no threat cost, so they'd invariably get the extra bonuses)

Map of Earnil (already mentioned)

Pelargir Shipwright (already mentioned)

Smoke Rings (actually kind of cool, and we're getting new pipes soon. just hope they can be equipped on Hobbits or it might not be worth it to go down this route)

Lore

Beorn's Hospitality (can heal another hero... still probably isn't worth it playing this card at any rate)

Galadhrim Healer (same as above. probably isn't worth justifying the combo, but Galadhrim Healer is pretty awesome in her own right)

Mirlonde (but the effect doesn't matter, and doesn't even combo with Loragorn cos that wasn't your starting threat)

Mithrandir's Advice (probably the coolest use of it: +1 one card)

Scroll of Isildur (reduces cost down to a possible 0; can be used to play more Mithrandir's Advice)

also In the Shadows and Take no Notice, but you can already reduce them to 0 by having 3 Hobbit/Ranger heroes

Neutral

Justice Shall be Done (3 more resources before you flame out, but at the cost of 4...)

Fellowship

Fellowship of the Ring (gives you one more willpower by virtue of this new hero you have)

Frodo's Intuition (gives you one more willpower and one more drawn card if you Sword-thain a Hobbit)

Treebeard and Radaghast would be cool since they have built-in abilities for those resources (and collect some of their own), but they don't belong to a sphere of influence and therefore aren't eligible targets

also some upcoming cards in The Black Serpent (but i won't really comment on them to preserve spoilers)

with Leadership, all you're doing is mitigating the tempo loss by getting more resources from some effects (which Sword-thain is already doing), and Ingold is basically even more of a tempo loss since you need to hold another resource in reserve

Tactics has barely anything

Spirit is pretty much all banking on Caldara

Lore looks pretty nice with Mithrandir's Advice though

there's probably a decent multisphere Hobbit Sword-thain deck out there. hopefully they can get another equipable pipe

and of course you can simply make any ally a hero and load them up with hero-only attachments and even have an extra hero to soak up undefended attacks, but Sword-thain is 4 resources. there are other ways to help with that and most of the combos aren't really all that powerful or necessary
