# [Forest Grove + Guarded](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61825-forest-grove-guarded/)

 The rules for Guarded make it clear that if an objective is revealed during the staging step that a guard is dealt. However, should you also deal a guard when the objective is search for and directly added to the staging area via a card effect like Forest Grove? If yes, do you shuffle first then add the guard? Or just add whatever the next card was as the guard?

 The FAQ says that you resolve Guarded at any time the card enters play.  You'd need to shuffle the deck before drawing the guard, though, since otherwise you'd know what the guard card was going to be.

 Technically the rules say anytime it enters play 'from the encounter deck'. given ffg's past rulings, i thought there might be a chance that this would skirt that verbiage. For example if you can find a way to put it into the staging area from the discard pile instead.

 The FAQ doesn't use that language.  It just says anytime the card "enters play".

I'm not exactly sure what you are asking here...

1) Draw Athelas
2) Draw Guarded: Forest Grove

... that is it.. it just sits there as the guarded card until you clear it... after you clear it you..

1) search 4 and then place Athelas
2) Draw Guarded: ???

Guarded
The guarded keyword is a reminder on some objective
cards to reveal and attach the next card of the encounter
deck to the objective when it enters the staging area
from the encounter deck, and place them both in the
staging area.

I think the bolded text refers to the guard, not to the objective. The guard is always drawn from the encounter deck.

Hmmm... yea.. well .. it dose say that doesn't it.

The English here is clearly saying that the objective card needs to come from the encounter deck.. or at least seams to.

To me though it is obvious though repetition of nearly a year or how even long it has been from release and seeing similarly bad worded rules that this is not the intention. We need a ruling from Nate to be certain but I am personally convinced the spirit of the rules is that if the card is placed in the staging area, you draw a new card to guard it regardless of were the objective card itself was drawn from. Regardless of this terribly worded citation.

 The FAQ can supersede the rules.  Here is what the FAQ says.  In my view, if the FAQ contradicts the core rules, the FAQ wins.

(1.01) Encounter Keywords
Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play, including during setup.

Consider this a ruling from Nate, since, you know, he wrote the darn thing.  This seems to be a revision of the keyword rules, NOT a clarification.
