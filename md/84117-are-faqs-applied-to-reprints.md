I have two core sets.  First instruction book is © 2010, the second is © 2012.  And they seem identical.  I also don't see any differences in the cards themselves.

Do revisions and reprints include FAQs?  Or are they identical to the first releases?

So far, no, the reprints are identical to the original prints. Many players have discussed the possibility of errata'd cards (you could probably search the forum and easily find a dozen threads) but FFG hasn't applied them to the Core Set (so far) which is in its fourth printing (I think). Based on that, I don't expect the reprinted APs to have errata printed either. On BGG someone has used a card editor to make "errata'd" versions of the appropriate cards. You could print those and proxy them (either on top of the original card (In sleeves) or on sleeved cardstock.

this is not entirely true; 3 cards have been corrected from the first run of core set cards: dol guldur beastmaster, the nazgul, and a quest card from escape from dol guldur.

Thanks for the catch DI, I hadn't heard about that.

Interesting.  Thanks for the heads up.  Does the BLUE DOT on the packaging indicate anything?

I'd think this would apply to A:Netrunner as well.

A:Netrunner is different.  I have two core set, one is dated 2012 and the other 2013.  The rulebooks are different (the flow chart of the timing structure is updated as per the FAQ).  There is no card errata for A:Netrunner so far, so the cards are the same.

I'm not sure about the rulebooks that come with the physical sets, but I know the downloadable version of the core rules at least has the updated scoring.
