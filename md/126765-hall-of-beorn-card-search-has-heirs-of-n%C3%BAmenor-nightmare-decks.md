finally got around to ordering the POD stuff I don't have - Heirs Nightmare, Long Dark, Foundations of Stone and Shadow and Flame Nightmare, and Old Forest. Probably won't get much time to play them before Christmas, but then I have two weeks off, so I know what I'll be doing!

I think he meant "want", not "won't".

What is wrong with you people? Why are you excited about this?

Because other than Shadow & Flame NM and Dol Guldur NM these will arguably be the hardest quests in the game. Once you have beaten everything at least a couple times you always strive to see just how hard it can get while still being able to pull off a win. So for me they will be an epic adventure.

Yes I'm glad Heirs got nightmare; I think it really needed it. From a solo perspective, Cair Andros was one of easiest quests in the game, it really needed a harder version. However I'm quite surprised they DID NOT put some hate into eagles/defender of rammas ect. I'm not quite sure how its going to be that much harder when you can still quest for 15 on first turn and even more every round with guys like Beregond, thalin, rammas, winged guardian ect.

They should not hate on Ramnas IMO, but Eagle hate would have been cool. Rammas is a Gondor character, so that it would do good in HoN only fits thematic. The Eagles on the other hand, continuely showing up in siege/battle quests, not thematic at all. A Vassel of the Windlord quests for three in a brawl fight (PiP) and so on..

You know I just had a wild thought. These battle/siege quests force us to expend our attacking/defending forces on questing, limiting our combat options if we want to succeed and also render the willpower useless.

 

So, what if these quest keywords, aside from changing willpower into something else, had some additional effects upon successful questing? Like, for example: 

If players successfully quest on a battle quest, then each player may assign 2 damage to an engaged enemy (or each enemy gets -2 defense, or each charageter gets +1 attack). 

For siege could be something like "each player may choose an engaged enemy. that enemy does not attacks this combat phase.".

Very cool idea. Balances out having to use your attackers and defenders to quest. Might be useful in future scenarios that feature siege or battle. The quest would need to be fairly difficult as well or it might be TOO beneficial. Really like the idea though!

LOL. Derek, you are such a newb. What are you even doing on these forums? Isn't there a Conquest tournament for you to be playing right now. Your Orks miss their champion! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Has anyone actually tried these quests yet? If so want to give us a report on your findings?

How you have the label 'the opener of ways'?

Yes  i know, but how do you have this label? Boored has also 2000 posts and he only writes 'member'. Ups, can each one change it in his profile?

I have a deck which fairly consistently beats Into Ithilien solo (http://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/deck-out-of-ithilien/ [http://hallofbeorn.wordpress.com/2014/07/29/deck-out-of-ithilien/]) and I plan on giving this a shot tonight. I do not expect it to go smoothly, but I will certainly share my thoughts - after I've cleaned up the wreckage.
