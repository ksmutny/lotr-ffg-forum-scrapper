I can trigger Expert Treasure Hunter after the Forced effect of the 2B in the Lonely Mountain after I quest successfully?

From the FAQ:

 

> (1.37) Timing of effect resolution
>  
> When resolving multiple effects with a shared condition, players should use this order of resolution: passive abilities first, Forced effects second, Response actions third. When determining the order of effect resolution among abilities within those categories, players should first resolve abilities that use the word “when” and then resolve abilities with the word “after”. A player card effect that cancels an encounter card effect interrupts this timing structure. A cancel effect must be triggered immediately after the encounter card effect that it cancels.

So yes. You would resolve the Forced effect on stage 2B first, and then after resolving it, you can resolve the Response effect on Expert Treasure Hunter. Do note that when you resolve an effect, you resolve it completely before moving on to the next effect with the same trigger. So if your burgle attempt is successful, you then have to choose whether or not to advance to stage 3, and only after that do you trigger Expert Treasure Hunter.
