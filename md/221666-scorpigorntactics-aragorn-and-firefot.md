Hi

would this be okay, Aragorn kills an enermy drags one enermy to him and then uses firefot on the new enermy? The timing here is strange but i think you can chose the order of responses.

It seems like you could.

Yep, I compared the wording on Dwarowdelf Axe and Firefoot/Aragorn. The timing is Aragorn III then Firefoot. The reverse order is not possible due to different words used and timing.
