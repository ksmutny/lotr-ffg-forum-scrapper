Hello, Have a few questions concerning this adventure…

 

The Objective/ally Eagle at the beginning (wylador??) Do I simply claim him the moment i Quest? or am i missing something?

The plants that help you Heal the Eagle at the end, IF they are on a hero that gets killed can i move them to a new hero or are they tossed back into the staging area.

The quest 2B has a rule, any card effect used to heal the eagle is removed from the game… does that apply to a HERO using their heal ability ( i forget the elf's name(12threat).. would i lose that hero? or does that rule apply to EVENT cards only?

 

Thanks.

1. The first player gains control of the eagle the moment he comes into play ( aka from the start on ). He changes control with the first player token.

2. No you cannot move them. It the hero dies they are discarded.

3. Yes, Glorfindel must be removed, too.

Under "support" on the FFG website for Lotr LCG you can look at the rules that come with this quest.

I believe the answers are as follows:

1. Wilyador will start the game under the control of the first player, once you enact Quest 1A.

2. the Athelas will be discarded (ie go to the encounter discard pile). I *think* this is correct but I can't actually find a direct reference in the rules/FAQ. My reading is that it becomes an attachment on the hero under his control. Therefore, hero death means this is discarded, and because it is an encounter card, it goes to the encounter discard pile. You certainly can't move them to another hero.

3. Yes, this will apply to a hero as well.

 Yes, it is rather harsh on Glorfindel.
