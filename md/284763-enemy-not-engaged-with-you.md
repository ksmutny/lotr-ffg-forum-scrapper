Does "Enemy not engaged with you" cover enemies in the staging area? I assume it means only enemies that are engaged with someone other than you, but since it doesn't expressly say that I feel there is room for interpretation. I came up with this question while looking at Haldir (hero).

If you haven't engaged an enemy, Haldir can attack any enemy not engaged with you, whether that enemy is still in the staging area or engaged with a different player.

If you *have* engaged an enemy this turn and can't use Haldir's ability, he can still attack enemies engaged with other players because he has Ranged.

I indeed covers enemies in the staging area, as long as enemies in the staging area are not engaged with you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
