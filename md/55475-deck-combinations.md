Hey

I want to make 2 combined decks out of one core box. With those two decks I'm going to play and add cards from the adventure pack. Per scenario I going to choose the heroes so I can play with all of them.

Which are good combinations? 

Thanks

Werner

Dúnhere, Éowyn, Théodred surely the one. With the expansions, the Rohan-theme deck shall rule.

Boromir, Eleanor, Imrahil is a nice Gondor counter-part but you want heroes only from the core set? Then Denethor, Glóin, Legolas perhaps.

 I have a very powerful Spirit/Lore (Eleanor/Eowyn/Beravor) & Tactics/Leadership (Theodred/Gimli/Brand son of Bain) Decks,( of you dont have brand, you can use Thalin). you can find the Spirit/lore deck in here javascript:void(0);/*1319908759561*/ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efpag=0&efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=569437] (under rep#14), although some of the cards are not from the core box, the original version was from the core, so you can sub any cards you dont have with cards from the core box. 

Cheers
