Hello!

I'm still looking for a storage solution for my cards. I use FFG sleeves and now the main box with inverted inlay is too small to store all the cards. I searched the net about this allreasy but I coudn't find a good solution. I tried buiding something myself, but it worked not well :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

How do you store your sleeves cards?

Looks like it takes you a year to setup a game ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I like these: http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004P313MW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01 [http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004P313MW/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i01]

They come in a range of sizes, and you can easily make your own simple dividers out of bits of card or similar.

 Wow, jjeagle, I have one of those for my SW:CCG collection but have never seen another like it before. As far as finding dividers for something like that, you could use the cardboard inserts that come inside the APs (if you've saved them all). That's what I've been doing. I'm wondering, though, how people are running out of space. I have 3 columns in my core box and have all the Shadows of Mirkwood and Khazad-Dum, but I still have no cards in the center column of my box. I thought the Dwarrodelf packs would all fit easily when I buy them at the end of the cycle.
