Your last hero is shuffled in your deck because of "Lost and Alone", but you continue the game.

What happens when an enemy attacks you?

You can let them pass without any problem?

Think you lose the game if your last hero gets shuffled into your deck.

I seem to recall reading somewhere that if you lost control of all your heroes, you're done for.

You might want to look that up though, as I'm not 100% sure.

I'm too lazy right now :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

No, the FAQ says that you are still in the game:

 

"If your last hero gets shuffled into your deck you are not eliminated from 
the game; heroes are not considered to be killed unless 
they are in your discard pile. You will continue playing 
until you either draw the hero, are eliminated through 
other means, or the game ends."
 
Which means that the original question is a tricky and interesting one - I don't know what the answer is. One possibility would be to say that this means you lose - undefended damage HAS to go on a hero. If you don't have a hero in play, you can't satisfy this, so you lose. Maybe.

Ah ok...got it wrong then, thanks for looking it up jj.

Odd ruling though IMO.

I don't get it really...are they trying to be as vague as they can be with some of these rulings???

Yes, it's not clear... what happens when you have no heroes (because some of them are now in your deck) and an enemy makes un uncontested attack? I think you should at least gain 1 Threat per point of damage it would have done.

It's definitely not clear but I think to play with a harder option: always defend otherwise you cheat the game by being able to put undefended damage on any random ally (put 6 undefended attack on a useless ally with 1 hp) sidestepping the whole danger of doing undefended.  OR since you're already losing with no heroes on the table just be able to declare undefended and put it on allies.

What if you have no allies either?

 

I know you´re in a bit of bad shape but if your deck is heavily reliant on attachments it is a definite possibility.

oooh! in that case enemies would never attack but just pile up until your hero finally comes and then the enemies would just kill him...
