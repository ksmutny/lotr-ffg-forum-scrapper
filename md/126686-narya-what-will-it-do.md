Now that we have Gandalf and the two other Elven rings, he's bound to get it sometime. What do you think it will do?

Action: when gandalf has his staff, pipe, shadowfax, hat, cloak & toenail clipper attached, exhaust narya to win the game.

Gandalf was sent to inspire the peoples of Middle-Earth to fight Sauron and Cirdan gave him the ring because he knew the perils would be great. If the ring were originally designed for Gandalf, lore-wise I would've liked a buffing effect on allies or other heroes. But it was Cirdan's, and I don't know enough about him to take a guess. One thing - it probably won't add a resource icon like the other rings, since he already has them all.

It will have to do with a general buff of something... It's the best way to depict that theme IMO. Or maybe something to just heroes.
