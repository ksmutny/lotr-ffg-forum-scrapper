A player with Aragorn (Tactics) finishes his Combat phase with Aragorn still ready and with the Ranged keyword.

During the Combat phase of the following player, Aragorn is added to a combat (thanks to his Ranged keyword), destroys an enemy and thus engages another enemy, taking one engaged with the current player.

This enemy won't make any attack this round, since now he's engaged with Aragorn's player who already finished his Combat phase, right?

Correct.  If the Aragorn player has already resolved the attacks by enemies engaged with him, this new enemy would not make an attack.  

 

But, it's important to remember the sequence of the combat phase.  You resolve enemy attacks in player order, then players declare attacks in player order.  So the only way to do the "feint" trick with Aragorn is to use Quick Strike (or some other extra attack like Anduril) to allow him to attack outside of the normal framework, which generally means he has to attack alone.  I believe Ambush is the only way to do a group attack outside of the usual framework.  And the trick only works if you are attacking an enemy engaged with a player that is later in the turn order.  Otherwise you could potentially make an enemy attack twice!

Yes, I was thinking about "Quick Strike"
