Interesting that we haven't seen anything about Gollum for this box.  And you know he's in there somewhere...

Almost fooled me...

Why are there two Gollums? oO

They needed space in order to fit the two images together as one, so they had to fill the blank space at the bottom of the left image with something... Unless they are doing some wacky stuff with Gollum in this expansion lol

The Mouth of Sauron has always been in intriguing character to me.  Sauron certainly loved diversity in his captains, with the Mouth of Sauron being a Black Númenórean, as well as your very own, Khamul, being an Easterling ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

One of them is Smeagol.  He was really torn apart.

So, how soon until they announce the Scouring of the Shire PoD?

Earliest is next year, but most likely never.

Oh, you think it'll be a full saga expansion?  I suppose they could get three quests out of the Scouring, but that may be pushing it a bit...

No, I think they'll never print anything related to it.

That's possible, I suppose.  Though after getting so far into the story, it'd be a shame if they left out the conclusion.

I think it will be a Fall Fellowship POD adventure.

I think about a POD too. This saga is supposed to be the last one of LOTR campaign.
