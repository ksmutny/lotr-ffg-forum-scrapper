No seriously, is it a book? Is it a movie? Is it a video game? Is it the Illuminati's plan to take the world? Because we yet got the game number infinite with Android on it.

It's a universe, like Star Wars, or Lord of the Rings and IMO, it's actually pretty awesome! (Then again, I play netrunner, so I'm obviously gonna like it...)

 

There's books, Android:Netrunner, New Angeles (the game), Infiltration(another ffg game), and 1 other ffg game I can't remeber that exist in the universe.

 

(Shouldn't this be in the New Angeles forum?)

Okay, thanks. How did it start?

It is an FFG in-house property whose "universe" was originally developed for the eponymous board game, Android. It's an odd, baggy game that seems to purport to be a murder mystery but is actually something a great deal more amorphous. Check it out at https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/android/]. The creators have previously stated that there really wasn't any great reason for them to come up with such a carefully fleshed-out world for what was originally envisioned as a one-off game, but hey, most people seem to be pretty glad they did.

Bringing it back to LotR, I do hope FFG eventually returns to putting out more varied content in the Tolkien universe, as they've recently demonstrated for the Android one. That dice game doesn't really do it for me, but at least they remembered to do something with the IP.

Its a really cool futuristic setting, that kind of shows us what the world will look like if everything goes the way it is currently going.

Interesting that no one answered "it's an operative system"...

As an iUser I'm not sure how 'operative' that software is but some do call it an operating system. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Cool. I understand what happens in a game does not happen in others right(like that 23 seconds in Netrunner)?

Well, the same way our cycles tell a story and have a purpose for existing, the cycles in Netrunner also tell a story.  I've not been able to keep up with that game, but I did always enjoy the effort they put into it creating an actual "world".

The board games tend to be in the same universe but set at a specific timeframe within it. Most board games to date seam to be after the last delux but before the following cycle.

The identity trilogy books by Mel Odom take place before the core set of A:NR but do a great job of fleshing out and defining the universe that all the games take place in.
