hello,

 

during my quest phase, I draw Caught in a web from the encounter deck.
it becomes a condition attachmentsaying: "Attached hero does not ready during refresh phase unless you pay 2 resources from that hero's pool."

I attach it to Gimli

during combat, I engage a Forest spider. when the shadow card is revealed, it says: "Defending player must choose and discard 1 attachment he controls"

 

My question:

can I discard "caught in a web" ?
Or is this not allowed?

You cant cause the conditional attachment is not controlled by you.
