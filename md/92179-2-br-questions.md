1. was it ever ruled whether the one ring cancels surge, hide etc. as well as the other parts? i seem to remember it was

 

2. can a hero such as glorfindel be commited to a quest and be ready, and then commit to a hide test whilst still being commited to a quest?

thanks

1) Don't know about an official ruling.  But the card says it cancels "the effects" of an encounter card, which seems to cover everything on it.  I've been playing as if it cancels all keywords.

 

2) Nothing prevents a ready hero from committing to a hide test even if that hero is questing.  Sam + Fast Hitch is great here too!
