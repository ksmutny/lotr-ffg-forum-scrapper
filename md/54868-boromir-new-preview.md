discard completely- a hero? a first i thought this was madness, but it ties in perfectly to the books, his small sacrifices every turn, then the ultimate sacrifice when times are at worst- awesome!

we had already seen Boromir.  The big take away from that article is the amazing Dunedain Cache.  That card will see a ton of play in multi-player games.  Also, i wouldn't put much thought into Boromir's sacrifice ability.  It's almost entirely flavorful and will rarely see play.  he is a fully functional character even without it.

The best part of Dunedain cache is that it's movable... uh oh ouch!

yes th cache is pretty dissapointing for a just solo player though, still cant have everything it is 1 -2 players

Hmm, lots of Dunedain stuff...

Love both cards.

The release is still some ways away, I say. I think we might see yet another preview next week before it reaches stores (in the states) sometimes after that (and in about a month in the rest of the world).

Action: Raise your threat by 1 to ready Boromir.

Am I reading this right? Can I as another player not playing Boromir sacrifice a resource (if it's red) to ready him for use by the controlling player?

No, you do not control the card. You can't use cards that you do not control.

You needn't any resource to ready him. If that is what you ask? You just raise threat. But only the controlling player can do that.

I believe if other players were able to raise their threat to ready Boromir it would say so on the card.  Eowyn's ability may be triggered by any player because her card says so.

From the Rulebook, pg. 25.

"Costs can only be payed with cards or resources that a player controls."

"A player “controls” all cards that he owns, unless another player or the encounter deck takes control of the card through a game effect."

Saruman: Bring out yer dead. 
Uruk-Hai: Here's one. 
Saruman: That'll be ninepence. 
Boromir: I'm not dead. 
Saruman: What? 
Uruk-Hai: Nothing. There's your ninepence. 
Boromir: I'm not dead. 
Saruman: 'Ere, he says he's not dead. 
Uruk-Hai: Yes he is. 
Boromir: I'm not. 
Saruman: He isn't. 
Uruk-Hai: Well, he will be soon, he's very ill. 
Boromir: I'm getting better. 
Uruk-Hai: No you're not, you'll be stone dead in a moment. 
Saruman: Well, I can't take him like that. It's against regulations.

As for strategies involving this card, all I need to say is "Fortune or Fate," "Dwarven Tomb," and "Galadhrim's Greeting."  This would involve having spirit resources, but it would be worth it.  Also, as always, Gandalf should be thrown in for good measure.

Suddenly I see a hobbit in in frayed worn down cloak with the hood pulled low on its head banging a cat against a wall.
