# [Silvan, Noldor, ... Sindar?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46737-silvan-noldor-sindar/)

I'm wondering why Legolas is considered a Silvan elf.  He lived with Silvan elves, but he himself was Sindarin.

Is FFG going to just put elves into two categories: Noldor and Silvan?  Or will they include Sindarin as well?  If so, then why not call Legolas a Sindarin in the first place?

How would/will FFG classify Celeborn?  He is Sindarin, but lived among the Silvan elves - just like Legolas.  Will he just get the Silvan tag as well?

What about Galadriel?  She lived among the Silvan elves, but she was Noldor.  I assume she should be Noldor, like Glorfindel, but does FFG care more about who elves live among, or do they care more about what their ancestry is?
