My collection of LotR LCG cards was stolen from  my car last night. I had recently bought Black Riders, and played with it ONCE, in addition to a ton of other expansions and adventure packs I had bought before (and sleeves). I am in a financial situation where I can't just go out and replace everything, so it's particularly painful. So please, learn from my mistake and lock your doors.

Oh man, that totally sucks. Many years ago I had a (very expensive) Magic deck stolen, including cards I had borrowed from a friend. I know how awful this feels and you have my sympathy. If you email me at HallOfBeorn@gmail.com, I can help you out with a new copy of The Black Riders (I'm assuming that you are in the US, otherwise the logistics will be a bit trickier). Just know that not everyone in this world is evil.

I'm so sorry for you man, that's awful. Hopefully someday you can get new cards and actually get to enjoy the awesomeness that is BR. : )

That's an absolute nightmare, I'm really sorry to hear that.

There are obviously still many in the world who are orc-minded.

Thanks for your sympathy everyone. This is especially painful now that the LotR Saga expansions are starting, and being able to play through the events of the books is pretty much all I've wanted to be able to do from the beginning. XD 

I'm getting married in about 9 months, so if I haven't been able to replace a large chunk of my collection by then, hopefully I can add some packs to my registry and get them that way! Who needs practical things as wedding gifts, right? Haha.
