So yeah what are you favorite people?  I apoligze if this has already been asked, but if it has, with new people and all, there will be differant results.

My favorite people are the Haradrim.  Just think, if they would have been on Gondor's side, I just wonder if those Mumaks would have been able to take out the whole Mordor army sieging Minis Tirith?  That would have been awesome :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]   Another reason I like them is beacsue they are more of an unknown people and are way the heck out of the way were everything happens.  That just leaves me wondering all about them and dieing for more information about them.  But yeah those Mumaks, in the book I believe it said that the only way they could be killed is by shooting arrows in thier eyes, am I right?  The movie was a bit differant but man I would have loved to be on the walls of Minis Tirith and watch those big guys mow right through the enemy.  

Second favorite would be the King Tharanduil's Elves.  They seemed like more of the casual party type guys in the book.  And I like how they got deep dark prison cells.  It seems like only the bad guys have the creepy prisons but the King Thranduil's elves actually treat the bad guys like bad guys. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

So yeah what are your favorites and why?

yeah i had a thread like this about a year ago- it was a great thread so thanks for re doing it.

my favourite, by a long way are the hobbits and dunedain. i love the culture of hobbits. the fat lazy, smoking, drinking and over eating hobbits. everything is peaceful and quiet.

on the flip side i love the rangers…completely opposite to hobbits but closely related. transient and mysterious. swift and deadly. i love the fact they are a wandering people from a shattered kingdom

i also love ringwraiths. they are an amazing enemy. again mysterious and very creepy

OK sorry about that.  I'm too lazy to look and see if its been posted already so…. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]   

Man It would be so cool if you could follow Khamul throughout the books instead of Frodo and Gandalf.  Or any other person.  

Hobbits are not my favorite because they seem to be the most normal and just like "ehh I dont care what's happening in the world" and then I'm like "WELL YOU SHOULD!!" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  If you were to follow the Hobbit's life in the shire, I think it would get rather boring.  Sorry to disagree with you but I'm mainly just trying to say something about your post. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

no need to apologise (i wrote clarify there for some reason…) its threads like these that make me put up with the aweful forum loading time ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

i think my perfect hypothetical life in middle earth would be a ranger (adventure and wandering the wilds) mixed with a healthy amount of staying in the shire to relax and drink….ahh..perfect

Same man.  It takes like 5 minuets to load the forum most of the time.  It's wierd…… 

To add on to my first post, I think it would be so cool to hang out with Thranduil and his elves.  That part is my favorite part in The Hobbit when the dwarves are takenn prisoner and Bilbo does his whole sneaky plan.   Haha I wonder what the jail guy's punishment was after all the dwarves were gone. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

i think the worst thing they could have done to him was take him out of the nice little job he had of guarding no one and drinking the king's wine…

Stupid computer crashed during my first attempt to comment here… after I had nearly everything typed out of course… lol

 

I loved the Ents.  Just the thought of being an old relic of a forgotten era.  Something that was talked about by only a few people, and only in terms that spoke of enchanted woods and stories of boogeymen.  Being something older and wiser, detached and ignored (outside of a few meddling wizards or elves every so often)…  Having knowledge and experience of EONS behind me, but being relatively unkown.

Until I decide to wake up and destroy your city.

 

Or the Eagles were also fascinating to me, for many of the same reasons.  Aloof, proud, noble… secure in their eyries.  NOBODY really messes with them.  And then every so often Gandalf begs them to bail his butt (or someone elses) out of hot water…. Save a wizard?  Sure thing.  Tear apart a bad of wargs?  Yaaaaaaawwwwnnnnn…. what's next?

i almost forgot dwarves…..i love their underground-ness….(great word isnt it?)

i mean they literally shut themselves away from the world for generations…..it gives them a sort of detached feeling. i also like their general stubborness

But if I had to stick with humanoid groups, I would have to agree with Rich.  The Dunedain were my favorites.  To me they were a glorious mix of Robin Hood's noble band of merry men and King Arthur's valiant knights… and Assassin's Creed (apologies for the blatant digital reference… lol).

They remind me much of the dwarves of Middle-Earth, as a displaced remnant of a greater race that the world seems to have forgotten, but perhaps moreso.  The dwarves plight seemed more well-known, their grief more acceptable to the rest of ME… whereas the Dunedain seemed to be thought of as odd, out of place, non-compliant with the other factions of mankind.  Even amongst their southern brothers, who should appreciate their plight more than most, they seemed to be looked down upon as unwashed rabble, backwoods malcontents….  Their mystery to me lies in the fact that they clearly knew who they were, the "romance" in clutching to a history and purpose that no one else remembered.  Or cared about.

I think I prefer them so much due to their resemblance to my single favorite character in all of Tolkiendom - Túrin Turambar.  He was such a tragic figure, very much like the Dunedain, wandering through the woods.  Taking on whatever role or name suited his purposes or needs at the time.  Sometimes protector, sometimes brigand… determined.  Always aware of his nobility, but keeping it under cover in order to avoid detection as best he could.  It's also why I liked Aragorn so much in the Cycle.  He was always so concerned of his heritage and doom of being Isildur's descendant.  In truth, I always thought of Turin as a much better pre-cursor for Aragorn (even though Aragorn wasn't a direct descendant from Turin's father, Hurin, but rather his uncle, Huor)…..  Both roaming the wilds, trying to wrestle with their noble heritage, fighting the doom over each of them that seemed inevitable.  And Aragorn succeeded where Turin failed (although he ultimately gained redemption by slaying the father of dragons, Glaurung).

Sorry for the first-age rambling.  The tales of Hurin/Huor/Turin/Tuor are my very favorite….. please enjoy this crab army as apology:
