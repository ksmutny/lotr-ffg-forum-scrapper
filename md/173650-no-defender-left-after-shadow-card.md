Hi there.

 

i just started playing this game and in my first game I came into following problem:

 

I am in combat with one enemy that is still alive.

3 chars, 2 send into the adventure, so I got one left to defend.

Then the big spideris brought into game. So one char has to get exhausted (don´t no the correct term, playing the german cards).

So here is my problem: I am in combat with one enemy, have one char to defend and the card effect says to exhaust one char. That is my defender, right? And this means he can´t defend anymore. So where does the attack of the enemy go.

 

And another follow-up problem: If I send all chars into the adventure with no one left to fight Do enemies not attack me? Do they attack menace points ? Or are heroes damaged that are already exhausted ?

 

Thanks in advance for your help !!!!

For the 1st question, if you have no defenders it would be an undefended attack so the damage would be spread across your characters.

The 2nd question - if you send everyone to quest and an enemy comes up that will attack you during the combat phase then the enemy does so and again it goes as an undefended attack and you do like before.

The damage of an undefended attack will NOT be spread across characters....

 

It will go to a single hero without counting its defense.

 

 

From Core rules, pag 18:

 

If an attack is undefended, all damage from the
attack must be assigned to a single hero controlled
by the active player. Allies cannot take damage from
undefended attacks. If a defending character leaves
play or is removed from combat before damage is
assigned, the attack is considered undefended. A
character’s defense does not absorb damage from undefended
attacks or from card effects.
 
PS: Bold mine

It's not clear to me which card effect exhausted your defender.  If he was exhausted during questing you are out of luck.  But if it was a shadow effect, that happens after you declare (and exhaust) defenders.  In that case all of your characters are already exhausted and the shadow effect would do nothing.  I'm guessing it was this guy?
