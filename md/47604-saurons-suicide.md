I have never thought that but today i realised that pursued by shadow can bring Gandalf to your hand.I sented Gandalf for quest and his was exhausted.Only a goblin was in the staging area so i made Eleanor the defender and the shadow effect was PBS.I said to my self it cannot be.I can't have Gandalf again in my hand by a shadow effect (but i did it lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]).

Does Sauron wants to suicide lol?

Yea this could be a nice idea if we were palying events from the trilogy but i like how you are thinkinggui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif].

 At the very least Sauron seriously underestimates the power of the Grey Wizard.

Very well, since the quests here are not detailed or even mentioned in the books, is it possible that gandalf the grey had a similar experience and became Gandalf the Light Grey, during his time before the fellowship? gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 Unfortunately, in this game, Gandalf often has a tendency to come and go constantly..... maybe he actually started as Gandalf the Black.....?preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

I think they wanted Gandalf act in this game like in the books.Gandalf always comes and goes and no one knows his actions but wen hope starting to fade if you look in the east Gandalf is always there to save the day gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif].

And it's well known that Gandalf to act sneaky like (with sneak attack) like a ranger!

Yeah.... OK..... I guess if you start talking SERIOUS I kinda got that. And it really is a thematically brilliant thing. I for one loved that aspect of the card.

Yea on one hand i wanted Gandalf as a starting hero but on the other hand they did an excelent job with Gandalf.I just hope FFG will give us a hero version of Gandalf in the future.

Yes i think we must wait until the end of the first cycle of the adventure packs to see a new version of the characters we have now (or maybe with the first expantion?).

## 15 [felix16 on June 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47604-saurons-suicide/?do=findComment&comment=478964)

 Yes, I would think so. Especially those who are alredy allies will probably be far back in the line for hero status.

## 16 [Ileopsoas on June 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47604-saurons-suicide/?do=findComment&comment=479051)

Maybe Gandalf the White is coming to stay with us as a hero!

His starting threat will be realy high.Somethink like 16-19.

## 18 [felix16 on June 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47604-saurons-suicide/?do=findComment&comment=479554)

 Then I guess we´ll have to wait and see if they start publishing content based on the actual War of the Ring.
