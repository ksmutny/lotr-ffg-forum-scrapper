Hello,

I have a question for you, when a card is played from its hand, it is discarded after its effect, so, do we recover in his hand "A test of will" with the effect of "Silver Harp" after having countered a encounter card ?

Thanks guys

No. In this instance A Test of Will is discarded from play, not your hand.

As @stimpaksam [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/309009-stimpaksam/] notice it don't work. Otherwise Daeron's rune also could discard itself on the middle of this resolution ?

However if this is relevant in any situation I don't think test of will is discard from play. An event never (and can't) come into play, it go from the hand to a unnamed zone (but secretly named the stack for every MTG players) and leave it to goes to discard pile after his resolution.

Haha, that's a funny point about Daeron's Runes. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
