I've been playing this quest solo endlessly for the past 2 days, without even being close to winning. I've tried a variety of decks with no success. The 8 progress on the Great Hall really cripples the ability to make any progress in the quests, and the Time 5 in 1a feels is almost nothing. The most I've done is get 1 of the clues and advance to stage 2, only to then be crushed by the enemies. Has any of you beaten this quest solo? How many objectives ahve you managed to get? I'd love some strategy tips, this quest is really hard!

I'm fifty fifty on it with my superhero attachment deck. It is hard, no doubt and I've never even come close to one clue. Fortunately you don't need them. I completely agree it's a stern test. Some of the shadow effects and treacheries make me want to cry.

I've tried the Erestor deck from the FFG article against this quest ans failed each time (although I was testing the deck more then the quest).

 

Seems to me like this quest needs a lot of willpower. I'm working now on a deck to beat the Antlered Crown solo, with Elrond and Frodo and Merry (Spirit), with crazy location control. I think that if this deck works against Antlered, it should be good against Rhudaur also.

Yeah, I tried Erestor too and it was a joke.

It seems strange to me that they would release a decklist in parallel with a new scenario that has absolutely no chance of ever beating it. I haven't tried it myself yet (AP is still in the mail) but that's what I gather from the responses so far. I wonder how much these decklists are tested.

I don't have the pack yet. What is the official difficulty rating for this quest? (not that it means much, but...)

It's DL 5, as was the first and second APs. The third was DL4.

I think it's every bit as hard as the first one and maybe harder. Much harder than 2 & 3.

Has anyone tried Rhudaur solo and multiplayer? Is it easier in multiplayer?

I would rate this one at 7, Wastes at 6, Ettenmoors at 5 and Gram at 3. The best AP in this cycle so far.

I think it is a mistake to try too hard to beat one or more of the side quests. Focus on getting a load of allies out for the extra attacks in the second stage instead. I've used a Loragorn/Grima and Ent deck which works quite well for this one. Ally Treebeard and Loragorn with healing is a key for defending Thranduil's attacks.

Have you tried with any of the power decks, or are you trying to stick to theme? 

 

I gave it a shot with my buffed up Boromir deck, and crippled myself by not allowing mulligans or use of Amarthiel. Still steamrolled right through the quest on the first attempt.

The thing is that stage 2B is 30 quests points, ot could be nice to get at least 1 clue. Now, the total of quests points from clues is around 45 quest points... in 5 turns!! So, I guess that if you can quest with around 15 willpower points each turn, you should be in business....  :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

The side quests are tough to complete so I've been ignoring them. I think there should have been a bigger penalty for blowing them off. I guess there are some bad shadow effects if you don't get any clues, but then these can hit you in the first turn which is rather unfair.

 

This sounds like it could be an upcoming monthly challenge: complete all 3 side quests...

## 13 [danpoage on October 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190232-the-treachery-of-rhudaur-how-are-you-beating-this/?do=findComment&comment=1832584)

I beat it with my Keep It Secret, Keep It Safe deck on the second try. I don't see how you would ever gain one of the clue objectives solo - it would take an absurd amount of luck. Without the clue, I just had to deal with the shadow effects being insane (Staff of Lebethron on Sam was the key for me) but my overall solution was to avoid engagement as much as possible and keep my threat low. I built an ally army so that I could quest through the 30 quest points on stage 2 in a couple of rounds (Ally Faramir was key for this). By doing it this way, I only had to face a couple of attacks from Thaurdir. He did get a Sorcery on the last round, but I had enough attack waiting for him (Ally Beorn is a nice friend to have) to finish him off. For the extra attack caused by the Sorcery I just sacrificed a chump blocker, and the healing didn't matter enough to prevent me from finishing him.

 

When playing this quest solo, I completely ignore the clues as a viable strategy and just always choose the +1 Threat to locations (Sift Through the Debris [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Sift-through-the-Debris-TToR]). This seems bad, until you realize that the best strategy it to quest aggressively so you should only have one or two locations in the staging area at a time anyway. I basically look at the time 5 as a counter for how long I have to setup for facing the boss and questing to victory. In that regard, an ally army (and avoiding ever making Decipher Ancient Texts [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Decipher-Ancient-Texts-TToR] the active quest) makes the most sense. Henamarth or other scrying can help you plan for treacheries and player side quests can be chosen when Centuries of Sorrow [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Centuries-of-Sorrow-TToR] hits. For that matter, a couple of player side quests buys you rounds in stage 1 that you can at least be doing something productive, since there is no hope in actually finishing one of the 3 starting encounter side quests. Gather Information helped me to get Ally Faramir which was a key component in being able to put 30 progress on stage 2. Likewise, Send For Aid could be used with a similar end result. In general, ally mustering was key to help deal with the power questing and defending and kill one enemy per round (when possible). This quest is basically a race, and you want to get as many characters in play as possible to help you run it.

Tried the quest again solo, and won. I always seem to quest for the enemy side quest. Questing hard right out of the gate is the key strategy. As long as you can get at least one clue before the timer goes away you'll be fine. But easier said than done I guess. In fact, the time where I lost, I didn't have Faramir on the field, he was paramount to all my victories so far. My threat was always skyrocketing thanks to the one-man army Boromir and treacheries (sneak attack Gandalf twice just to lower my threat), but I took down the enemies as fast as they came. Keep in mind, I do play Easy mode, so that can have a real factor in my ability to win (those extra resources is effectively makes it Time "6" instead of "5" when it comes to resource generation).

Finally I managed to beat this quest using my mono-Leadership Gondor deck. I played 2 games and won both. The first one wasn't so hard since I got all my key attachments early and even managed to complete Quiet the Spirits just in time. The second one was really rough due to enemies and treacheries, and in the last 2 rounds I lost Balin and Aragorn AND Steward of Gondor due to treacheries, undefended attacks, etc. But in the very last round I already had tons of allies in play and had already damaged Thaurdir enough, so it was just a matter of summoning more allies with A Very Good Tale, then readying all of them with Strength of Arms and quest for a million, making enough progress. Man, Strength of Arms is so good, especially with cards like Veteran of Osgiliath. In any case, now I understand that the clues are more of a bonus in this quest, but they are still possible to get. This is definately the most difficult quest in the cycle so far to me, and I am actually very afraid of Carn Dum double finale quests.

Took it out with my mono Spirit Eowyn/Idraen/Glorfindel deck (including OHaUH Gandalf). High willpower, treachery/shadow cancellation, and enough attack to kill enemies carried the day.

Just curious - was it enough willpower to complete a side quest?

Yeah, I completed the Quiet the Spirits side quest. Having 9 willpower out of the gate with the 3 heroes (10 with discard for Eowyn) helps greatly. Still finished it with just 1 time counter remaining.

I usually found that killing any enemies in play before moving to the second quest stage was far more important than finishing a side quest = beat side quest lose the quest. Ignore side quests beat the main quest :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm curious, is everyone that is having difficulty with clues playing the side quest "progress effects" as triggering at any time, not just when it is the current quest?  I forgot to do that the first time I played.  Any time you kill an enemy, explore a location, or spend a resource from a hero for the "book" side quest you should be placing progress on the side quests.

 

I was able to get 2 clues before encountering Thaurdir, playing 2-handed.  Beat the quest the second time through, using Dori in one of my decks even!

Took a few tries, but I beat it with a Glorfindel, Pippin, Treebeard deck.  You have to get Asfaloth turn 1 to clear the location if you want any chance of getting a clue.  The time I beat it I had Asfaloth and LoV.  It also helped that the active location whiffed by discarding 5 locations/treacheries.  A couple turns later I got Unexpected Courage on Treebeard, so all three of them could quest and I could take out the quest that penalizes questing allies.  By the time Thaudir showed up Treebeard had 2 Unexpected Courages, Burning Brand, Self Preservation, and +1 defense from the Clue, so stage 2 became trivial.

 

In another try that I eventually lost, I was actually able to get 2 clues by exploring a bunch of locations and quest pushing with Treebeard's ability (and Healing Herbs on Pippin to heal him afterwords).

I beat it pure solo with an Erestor/Grima/Glorfindel 50 cards deck (submitted by another player) and I ALMOST got a clue (a treachery card forced to change the active quest without flipping the table over).

 

The 50 cards limit really makes the deck give you all good cards and fast. It also has Ents, so after a few turns, you can get ridiculous attack power.

 

The only thing is that I had to quest for the 30 points of the last stage, so I had to throw a lot of allies under the bus.

 

(I should take pictures of the cards of my last turn... or is it too geeky?)

First i try ,  i win. In 4 players. I was the quester player, with Balin, Theodred and Borormir leadership; other player the combat player with Tactagorn, Merry and Pippin; one player the defender, with Erk, Eowyn and Bifur, and other player some mysc with Treebeard, Glorfindel and Elrond. 145 final score, in 4 complete rounds and 45 victory points.

This quest is quite easy (and fun!) with four players. I can definitely see why this quest is extremely difficult solo.

I won this quest on my second try with my Glorfindel(sp)/Galadriel/Rossiel deck.  I was lucky to get Light of Valinor and Nenya pretty early on (though with Galadriel's draw ability, I don't usually have a problem getting to them).  With plenty of Silvan allies and my Heroes' combined 11 spirit; questing was not a problem.  Also, Glorfindel and Amarthiul were ready to deal with enemies as they showed up.  I managed to clear the location and enemy related side quest.  The resource one was hopeless.  I wasn't too impressed with the clues, but the ten less quest points on the final stage was nice.  Still, I look forward to doing this one with a friend or two to try for all the side quests.

I must share this.

 

I played that with a buddy yesterday and we steamrolled the scenario, I think in a combination of nearly having the right decks to do so and a tremendous luck.

I was playing a Dunhere / Theodred / Erkenbrand and he was playing a Thédoden / Eowyn / Eomer.

 

During the first five turns, we got very lucky, revealing mostly unharmful treacheries (the one giving +6 quest points) and not a single one enemy (strange... but true). We did not complete a single side quest, so we got to stage 2b, with the full 30 quests points to do, but in the meantime, 5 turns with no enemies, we had a decent amount of willpower on table, 3 Test of Wills in hand and Erkenbrand with The Day's Rising, Raven-Winged Helmed, 2x Dunedain Warning, Heir of Mardil, 2x Unexpected Courage and Westfold Horse-breaer everywhere on the table. This was enough to withstand the multiple attacks of Thaudir and his minions (7 attacks in the penultimate turn, and Theoden died from a 8th undefended), and on a last turn, each one of us with 48 threat, we rush-quested (already 27 points were on the quest), smashing two treacheries with the Test of Will we had in hand.

The two treacheries were Sorcery, so my friend has to lose Eowyn and Eomer to Thaudir's attacks and was eliminated (it was my fault as I totally forgot to use on unexpected courage at the beginning of the quest phase, so Erkenbrand was exhausted and could not defend those attacks...).

Though, I was questing for 4 (Théodred, Erkenbrand, Dunhere and a Westfold Horse-Breeder) and we needed 3 quest points (no encounter cards left in the staging area, except for the side quest that raise the threat of players, the reason why we ended at 48).

While definitely a pretty epic and hard earned victory it does not exactly sound like you steamrolled it per say with one player eliminated and your final threat at 48 =p

Yeah, but we actually chose to have our threat that high by triggering the action on that 5-threat location which allows you to do so.

Also, as I said, I made a stupid mistake by not defending the final attacks of Thaurdir with Erkenbrand.

Other than that, this really was cake walk, and we were quite surprised it was!

I was the guy who played with Banania.

 

As he said, we were surprised by our victory. It was an epic victory  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  In the last turn, we reveled 2 treacheries (one was canceled but you do not cancel the Sorcery trait so the Thaudir's immediate attack applied) and my 2 heroes died :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] . But even with the mistakes we made, we won ! We were lucky on the first turns, with revelling only locations and treacheries without dangerous effects. (+5 quest points on the side quests for exemple)

But we were aslo unlucky with our starting hands, especially Banania :-) And we don't play power decks, like Glorspindel Elrond Gandalf. We just played two 100% Rohan fluff decks.

 

I think we had a good decks combinaisons, and the good strategy too.

One deck with a huge sentinel defender stuffed on the first turns (Erkenbrand) and some resources advantage. And one deck with heavy questing (Eowyn and Rohan allies +Eomund+ Astonishing speed) and one strong attacker (Eomer + Firefoot).

Mustering the Rohirrim is now a great card, especiallly with the news Rohan unique allies from the Saga boxes (Hama, and actually the new Gamling is even better) . This time I picked Eomund with this event on the planing phase on the antepenultimate turn, and it was a huge help. Every caracter on quest except Eomund, then a Sorcery Treachery reaveled so Thaudir killed Eomund, and then every Rohan ready to fight for the combat phase, after puting 12 progress tokens on the 2B quest. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I think not spending too much resources for complete side quest on stage 1 was a good idea too. Better to stuff and be prepared for the 2d stage of the scenario.

Yeah, and I mean, with the Treacheries giving +6 quest points and the ones forcing you to choose another side quest, how are you supposed to complete anyone of those side quests??

 

Also, I just realized I did not even look at the Objective side of the cards. Are they granting the player more advantages than just a mere 5 quest points reduction during stage 2?

The one time I played it I completed one side quest, and if I'd managed to spare one more resource in an earlier round it could've been two. Admittedly that was with a Dwarf deck, though not a particularly finely tuned one.

The objective sides attach to a hero and give them +1 willpower attack or defence (depending on which one you got).

played this quest for the first time today.   I was playing a Rohan (S/S/Lo) deck with my wife playing Gondor (T/T/Ld). 

First turn she put out Gather Information, and I played Westfold Traveller, switching the Great Hall with the Ancient Causeway.   Because of this we cleared Ancient Causeway and Gather Information the first turn, allowing us to get the best cards from our deck and completely ignore the Great Hall the entire game -we just left it in the staging area the entire time.  

After a pretty good start we cleared 2 side quests before time ran out (Astonishing Speed was helpful) and smashed it on stage 2b.

Tried this solo one handed yesterday (along with Across the Ettenmoors which I won pretty easy on first attempt) with my Dunedain Deck

 

I had an easy time while on stage one and managed to get one clue, but the moment I went on stage two I came up facing 5 enemies (started to pile up after third round on stage one) which made my game nearly impossible. Tried to progress and had ten progress tokens on stage two but after a while I could just defend and nothing else, which made me dump the game

 

I hope I will try again today, liked it very much. Maybe I shoulc add the descendants og Kings event card on my deck so that I can ready characters on stage two to be able to attack as well

Almost whenever I lose this quest is because I get swarmed by Cursed Dead. If I can avoid or successfully defend against them, it's not such a big deal. Good thing you mentioned Descendants of Kings. That card has mad potential, I really hope the Dúnedain archetype becomes more playable in these last 2 packs. Really anxious about our new Leadership Dúnadan heroine! (I'm almost certain it will be a ffg created gal.)

What the Dunedain miss IMO are attachments that will make them a bit better to attack or defend when needed (you cannot trap always).

 

Also a liitle boost on their tactics, there is only one tactics ally IIRC. I have tried a lot with them, I like them thematically, I like the story behind them, that they are descendants from Numenor etc so I decided to try and win the whole cycle with pure Dunedain decks (apart from Henamarth Riversong). Unfortunatelly it seems that this will end on the battle of Carn Dum cause of the luck of fighting cards I mentioned

I don't have this quest yet, but the Dúnedain deck I've been trying out lately (see strategy forum) has been smashing Deadman's Dike pretty consistently. I use Damrod but you can switch him for Berevor (and the various card-draw effects for readying such as Cram and Wingfoot and more resource generation like Ranger Provisions) if you want to keep it Dúnedain pure. You could try my version of a Lore-Leadership Dúnedain deck and see how it plays because I feel this deck should get me through the entire cycle.

 

Descendants of Kings is a super-card btw! I too underestimated him, thinking it would only ready 1 or two characters which isn't such a big deal. But through playing it often I discovered that it's true power is that it readies 'enough' characters because it scales with how much in danger you are. Add Forest Snares to put extra power in it and you'll understand why I consider this card one of the most powerful ones in my Dúnedain deck.

 

Tactics only has 1 Dúnedain Ally and 1 Hero. Spirit has 2 Allies and 1 Hero and they have no synergy at all (maybe through Caldara bit). My take on the Dúnedain is that there are 3 'archetypes'. Tactics Aragorn/Dúnedain Hunter is about engaging enemies one by one and killing them. But it requires many non-Dúnedain as support due to their lackluster appearance in Tactics. Weather Hill Watchman Signals is about the signal buffs and small card-advantage it provides, but that's more of a minor deck-addtion. Finally there's trap-Dúnedain which I play, which is about trapping enemies with Forest Snare and powering up on it. I think that last one is a fully developed archetype, though I would appreciate more support for it. It's just that these archetypes don't mix that well.

I like your deck, I ve seen it, but I own only one core set which is a bit of a problem, so never managed to give it a shot

Tried today with all copies of descendants of kings and some other tweaks and went easily. Won on clue, the one you add progress when explore locations, on round four and nearly got another, the one you add progress when you kill enemies. Two copies of descendants of king where enough to damage thaurdir as much as needed on two consecutive rounds. Beravor with two dunedain warnings, burning brand and self preservation was good enough to defend thaurdir each turn

I don't think the intention is for us to actually be able to grab all 3, at least not without an aligning of the stars. I think thematically, it's more like grab what you can before time runs out, and make your choice. 

 

The best I've done so far is getting 2.

Just confirmed - you can reliably get all 3 with a cheesy Erestor + Love of Tales deck.

No, but if you watched my video on the Super Bilbo deck, it's very similar. You just take out the weak resource-generating cards (Wealth of Gondor, Gaining Strength, etc.) and replace them with Love of Tales and Songs. It just becomes insane and Bilbo is questing for 20-30 willpower by turn 2. This was actually my first iteration of the deck idea, but I figured people were tired of seeing LoT so I wanted to see if the deck could still be viable with alternative resource cards.

Sorry to be thick, but what card are you using to get Bilbo such Willpower?

Indeed, I am very intrigued by this potentially absurdly good deck. Is it good in this scenario only or have you tried it against more quests?

Once Bilbo has a pile of resources I play Lay of Nimrodel to give him lots of willpower.

> It seems strange to me that they would release a decklist in parallel with a new scenario that has absolutely no chance of ever beating it. I haven't tried it myself yet (AP is still in the mail) but that's what I gather from the responses so far. I wonder how much these decklists are tested.

Rule of thumb:

 

new heroes do rarely fit with 'their' scenarios

I noticed with AP the it's often cards that are relaesed later on that can help beat an AP.

Exactly.

 

Though I have to admit that Erestor is somewhat helpful in this scenario. Just got a swift 97 points win with Erestor and his Noldor pals Elrond and Galadriel. I had the famous Vilya + Light of Valinor combo in my starting hand which was soon joined by a combo that I am really growing fond of: Silver Harp + Elrond's Counsel. The rest was done by Henamarth and Protector of Lorien. Henamarth is so cool in this scenario, a shame I have only one copy of him!

How the hell do Silver Harp and Elrond's Counsel combo together? EC doesn't have anything to do with discarding cards. :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

Oh no, you're right! Looks like I (like, totally <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png] ) misread the card text. 

 

So basically the only use of the harp is that you can get back one of the cards that you discard at the and of the round or via Protector of Lorien? :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png] That's certainly a still ok-ish ability, but 2 resources is expensive for that...

Or use Daeron's Runes effectively without needing to discard, or recover a card lost to the Mirror of Galadriel. In other contexts, it'll work with Cirdan, it works with Elven Spear, it works with Eowyn, it works with ally Erestor, and it works with encounter card effects which discard from your hand. I'd say you're kind of paying for the flexibility.

Just made a small correction. While all you're saying is true, you can only use the harp once per turn. That's a lack of flexibility! I can totally see the benefit of this card, but for my taste it's too expensive for what it offers.

 

Especially as you can pay these 2 resources for playing Arwen, Bilbo or any of the other 2 WP spirit allies (or LoV, or..., or..., or...). That's especially true when you're playing with Erestor, as you want to play a good card immediatly from your hand instead of saving another good card for the next turn.

...no it's not. It can do many different things, that's flexibility. Would you say Core Gandalf isn't flexible because you can only trigger one of his enters play effects at a time? I hope not, because being able to do multiple at a time would be overpowered, and so would being able to repeatedly reuse the Harp instead of having to choose which use you felt was optimal at the time.
