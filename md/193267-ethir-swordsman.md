If I have one Ethir Swordsman in play, does he quest for 2?  I was thinking maybe he does, since he is an Outlands character I control.

 

Thanks for answering such a basic question.

He does give his bonus to himself, yes, as do all the Outlands allies.

If you you have the time to get at least half of the Outlands on the table, you're in business.

 

If....

In a two player game with a partner with a fast deck its no problem.  Outlands are not really a single player solution, but if your partner can hold the fort down for 2-3 turns depending on draw you can start spamming the play area with massively powerful chuds.
