Hi all I'm just getting into the lord of the rings card game and was looking at get one of the expansion packs. Can I get any expansion pack or do I need to start with the first expansion pack and how many sleeves do I need?

You can go for pretty much any expansion out there. I'd avoid the Nightmare packs and Print on Demand packs until you've got some experience under your belt, though.

Keep in mind that the Saga expansions do go in a particular order and the six adventure packs in each cycle collectively require a corresponding deluxe expansion.

I'd check out the "Path Less Traveled" series on the Darkling Door blog. It breaks down what cycles are good expansion options for new players. Authraw does an incredible job over there.
