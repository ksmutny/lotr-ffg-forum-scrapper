# [Favorite card per sphere?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/)

## 1 [Noccus on November 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1903432)

So I was wondering...what is everyone's favorite card to use per sphere and why?

Not necesserily the best, but the ones you really love to play.

Heroes not included.

 

 

Mine:

 

Leadership: Errand-rider. 1cost, 2hp, a fun to use great ability, and he can chump. So good, unless you play a mono leadership deck solo maybe.

 

Tactics: Hard to pick one, but I think I'll have to go with Black Arrow. Limited 1 per deck, when this epic card pops up I always get giddy and want to nuke something.

 

Spirit: A test of will. This might sound like a dull choice. But I always get a satisfied feeling when I just cancelled a devastating threachery card.

 

Lore: Daeron's Runes. This card is always a welcome sight when you draw it. 0 cost, draw 2, dump 1? Yes please. Love the "gamble" effect in it, if you discard a card you can also use, but really need that other card.

 

 

And out of these 4, it would be Daeron's runes, hands down.

I by default assume that heroes are excluded from the list

 

Leadship: Orthanc Guard. 2def/hp for 2 most cheap resources of the game makes me include him in every deck that has Leadership in it. 

Lore: Ranger Spikes. Anything that prevents enemy from beating the snot out of me and is also keeps him at low threat is simply a must have.

Spirit: Light the Beacons. This card is a game ender in multiplayer.

Tactics: Rumil. Good stats, has willpower, has ranged, hurts people. Well-worth the munah you pay for him, especially playing the artillery deck.

Neutral: White Tower Watchman. For 3 neutral resources, he is good even if you're not running monosphere. If you do, however, he is great.

I have a really hard time picking just one, since each sphere has great cards, so I'll pick as fw as possible and put them here.

 

Leadership:

 * Warden of Helm's Deep: 3 resources from the sphere best at generating them is a low price to pay for a defense 3, 2 health sentinel ally.
 * The Day's Rising: in certain types of decks this card is hilarious fun, and generates surprising amounts of free resources.

Lore:

 * Warden of Healing: splashes of healing often come more in handy than big single ones like from Daughter of the Nimrodel, Lembas, etc. Also, when you have Elrond (hero) on the table, even a single Warden becomes a powerhouse of heals.
 * Ranger Spikes: -2 threat and no engagement cost is an amazing lockdown tool, since it effectively removes many enemies from the game. Even better is if you also have Faramir (hero, Lr) out, since the Ranger Spike is basically a semi-permanent +1 attack for him.
 * Ambush: Another trap, this card is great if you're low on defenders since you can use that Combat action to defeat the enemy before they even have a chance to attack.

Spirit:

 * Northern Tracker: some quests are lousy with locations, and there is little better than Norther Tracker for dealing with location floods.
 * The Galadhrim's Greeting: lowering threat by 6, or lowering everyone's by 2, is an incredibly powerful effect, even for three cost. This is in most of my Spirit decks.

Tactics:

 * Dúnedain Hunter: While it's less useful in enemy-light scenarios, in your average scenario this is an incredibly cheap 3-attack ally, as strong as some heroes.
 * Knight of Minas Tirith: It's been less powerful as of late, but this is a great card for clearing the staging area of smaller enemies, plus his 3 attack is no slouch for later.
 * For-hammer: with card draw often an issue for tactics decks, this card is a godsend for accelerating your options.

Neutral:

 * Keen as Lances: Hard to pull off in your average deck, in ones built to make use of its special abilities its amazing, especially since playing one lowers the cost of playing another.

Maybe not the most powerful cards, but I love them.

 

Leadership: Warden of Helms Deep. Do not know why, but I like them a lot. Erestor is also close to him.

Tactics: Veteran of Nanduhirion, always a good feeling when they kill anyone, or defend an attack. The hardest one to pick, other cards (horns cry, Beorn...) is like I also a lot.

Lore: Harbour Master. Like Warden of HD, don´t know why I love them. I like expensive, doubtful allies a lot.

Spirit: Warden of Annuminas. Another really powerful 4cost ally, not so good ability, but very good stats.

 

Forgot neutral:

Saruman!!! Just love the character (mostly in the books, but in monies and games too).

Oh I forgot neutral.

 

Keen as lances it is then. Great fun to use playing in a group, and also a very powerful.

I'll be boring and basically give the cards that I use the most from each sphere:

Leadership: Steward of Gondor

Tactics: Gondorian Shield

Spirit: A Test of Will

Lore: Burning Brand

Neutral is not a sphere, but I use Song of Wisdom the most from that binder.

## 7 [Dwarf king Bronze beard on November 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1903645)

Well this is kinda hard question because there are so many great and fun cards to play in all spheres. Well here are some cards i do enjoy to play:

 

Leadership: A very good tale. I just like the idea and art in this card. It's powerfull but not overpowered.

 

Tactics: Eagles of the Misty Mountains. I love eagles and they'r best cards in tactics i think. This one is just the best of all and combined with support of the eagles it becomes even more better.

 

Spirit: A test of will. I just love this card. It has saved me so many times and i think there should be more treachery cancellation cards.

 

Lore: Expert treasure hunter. It's just so good card in all ways possible. You can make a deck around this card or just use it for free card drawing. You can also give it to other players so thats plus too.

I agree with you whole-heartedly that the eagles cards are some of the best in Tactics. I personally love me some Descendant of Thorondor, especially with Born Aloft and Meneldor's Flight being available.

 

I don't necessarily agree with you on Expert Treasure Hunter though. In a balanced deck, you have a roughly 2/3 chance of just discarding the top of your deck every time you trigger it. While it's great with hero Gandalf (since his ability let's you always know what's on the top of your deck), it's far too risky in the average deck for my tastes.

Define a "sphere".

I think he is referring to the Stand and Fight + Gandalf ruling that decided Neutral is not a sphere. It's also going to prevent us from putting Sword-Thain on neutral allies, sadly.

I remember that. I just think that the whole thing of neutral "not being a sphere" is a half-ass measure to prevent Stand and Fight from bringing back Gandalf without much errata (which I still think is stupid, we have a freaking Sneak Attack which does the same frigging thing for 4 less resources).

Hmm interesting thread. I think I need two from each sphere, fun and need.

Leadership:

Fun: Snowborn Scout ( best chump ever )

Need: Steward of Gondor

Spirit:

Fun: Northern Tracker (watch those locations)

Need: Galhadrims Greetings

Tactics:

Fun: Citadel Plate, with Gimli

Need: hmm. Maybe Gondirian Spearman as awesome chump

Lore:

Fun: Forest Snare (Haha! Gotcha)

Need: Daughter of Nimrodel (healness)

All quite core orientated but thats my progression.

Now that I remember the situation more clear, the feeling was that they made Stand and Fight wording initially to clarify that the ally is not restricted to spirit, but ended up contradicting their own rule, leaving neutral out. (Word "can" suggests this, because it enables, not disables.)

This has always bothered me as well. It would have been much less ambiguous if they had worded it "The ally must belong to a sphere of influence". Also, parentheses should only be used used for clarifications - they should not add limitations to a card effect.

This is an extremely difficult question.

Spirit: Elrond's Council

Lore: Warden of Healing

Leadership: Bill the Pony

Tactics:Feint

Neutral: Treebeard

## 17 [Kjeld on November 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1904204)

Leadership: Path of Need -- a eucatostrophe [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eucatastrophe] every time it hits the table (which isn't often at one per deck, and never for long).

 

Lore: Silvan Tracker -- when it gets going in the right deck, and you see the damage just fly off effortlessly at the end of each round, it is a priceless feeling.

 

Tactics: Beorn. Obviously.

 

Spirit: Fair and Perilous. Elf-lord revealed in wrath, anybody?

 

Neutral: Resourceful -- Making two-hero decks viable for five adventure cycles.

Favorite card per sphere is somewhat broad. I choose to interpret this as the cards that I enjoy playing the most, rather than the cards that I find most powerful, or use most often.

 

Player Cards

 

Leadership: Timely Aid

Tactics: Beorn (Core)

Spirit: Shadows Give Way

Lore: Distant Stars

 

Heroes

 

Leadership: Sam Gamgee

Tactics: Mablung
Spirit: Galadriel

Lore: Erestor

Leadership: Steward of Gondor, I love me some money!

Lore: Daeron's Runes, I like ditching uniques.

Spirit: A test of Will, cancelling those treacheries is just awesome!

Tactics: Eagles of the Misty Mountains, once buffed up and with two or three of these b*tches you can kick some ass! I quest with them also more then with other stuff in Tactics.

Neutral: Saruman. This doesn't require explanation. Together, my Lord, we shall rule this Middle-Earth.

Leadership: Ranger Summons. My favorite aspects of some quests is when an objective ally comes in when needed most. But not all quests has those cool moments. With this, I can do that with any quest. I want to see more cards like this. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Tactics: Beechbone. I love tactics. I love ents. I love direct damage. This guy is the whole package.

 

Spirit: Ethir Swordsman. I don't play much spirit so I had troubles thinking of a favorite. I chose the swordsman because he give a great boost to willpower. The more the merrier.

 

Lore: Forest Snare. Locking down an enemy is very nice. Even without Damrod's price reduction, I feel it's worth it. A close second was Wellinghall Preserver (3 WP for 3 that's not Spirit? yes please!)

 

Neutral: Gandalf 2.0. He quests for free and has amazing stats. He's just so powerful. I always try to keep him in play as long as possible. Threat is a resource, use it! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

My favourite player cards:

 

Allies:

Leadership - Faramir - high willpower is so important

Lore - Warden of Healing - super and cheap healer (super in combination with Elrond)

Spirit - Northern tracker - very good solution for many locations in stagging area

Tactics - Derndigle warrior - my favourite defender, best in combination with Booming ent (attack) and Wellinghall preserver (healing)

Neutral - Treebeard - good price, super stats and gain resources for ent cards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Attachments:

Leadership - King under Mountain - I like dwarves decks and this is super for this

Lore - Ranged spikes - I like traps and this is best of them

Spirit - Unexpected courage - super for more actions with one hero and it is not restricted or limited for one hero :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Tactics - Support for the Eagles - super boon in eagles deck

Neutral - Defender of West - it may save hero, universal and cheap title :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Events:
Leadership - A very good tale - one of my favourite cards, super for new allies on the table

Lore - Daeron´s runes - 0 cost x 2 new cards and discard worst card from hand.. for me super 

Spirit - Helm! Helm! - very good in my Rohan deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Tactics - Feint 

Neutral - Hidden cache - 2 resources are super, very good in combination with A very good tale and the others..

## 24 [Teamjimby on November 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1904620)

Tactics: Keeping Count - because everyone says it's terrible, yet I've had many games where I've given heroes +5-10 attack with a 0 cost non-restricted attachment.

 

Leadership: a Very Good Tale - It lets you get out to such a strong start.  Shines best in a secrecy deck with Timely Aid or in Gondor swarm decks.

 

Spirit: Hobbit Pipe - Pipe decks are so much fun once they get rolling.  Drawing 4+ cards per turn with enough threat reduction for a 4 player game.

 

Lore: Strider's Path - This card is really underrated.  When you don't have an active location, playing Strider's path is practically the same as cancelling a location card if the threat and quest points are similar.

 

Neutral: Envoy of Pelargir - Such a great utility card.  Effectively a 1 cost Gondor ally that gives you some resource smoothing.

Lore: Henamarth. I only have one copy of him, so I'm pretty excited everytime he pops up. One of the most useful allies.

 

Leadership: Sword that was Broken. Comboed with Aragorn this card can turn the tide single handedly.

 

Spirit: Arwen, obviously. I love the art, I love the special effect (see tactics)

 

Tactics: Gondorian Shield. I always feel better when I am prepared for battle.

 

Neutral: Treebeard. Fits into every deck and the reason why I never played the hero version.

I still enjoy playing Hero Beorn, but so many enemies have 4+ attack these days that I can't actually use him.

 

At some point I will put together a deck with Honour Guard and Horn's Cry so that I can keep the big bear alive. In any case, with all of the engagement-based effects in the new Dunedain archetype, Mablung is a lot of fun to play.

Leadership : Steward of Gondor
Spirit : Elrond's Counsel

Lore: Wingfoot

Tactics : Feint

Neutral : Core Gandalf

Not very original, but... I almost always end up including one of those in my deck (pure solo).

All very Core oriented like you said, but that's kind of refreshing. Lets us remember some of those decent cards we don't play anymore even though they really are pretty good (I'm lookin' at you, Gondorian Spearman). 

 

And Snowborn Scout IS an amazing chump, but I still think Squire of the Citadel JUST edges him out. You won't see him until next cycle though. But both of them together in a decent Imrahil deck? A thing of beauty :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] And even better later with Eomer!

 

As for me...well, there is a big chasm between my FAVORITE cards and the best. But since the question is about favorites...

 

Tactics: This is a hard one. I love the drama of Black Arrow and the badassery of The Hammer-Stroke or Gimli. But in the end, I have to go with a card that exudes both--Beorn! Few things more fun or dramatic as triggering his ability in the last turn of the game to cut down a Big Bad. 

 

Leadership: Lure of Moria. Me and my girlfriend played all the way from Core to Heirs (plus the Hobbit Boxes) with a pair of pure Dwarf theme decks. Loved the experience and it has forever skewed my appreciation of this card. So many great plays built on this card and so many fun memories. 

 

Spirit: Eowyn. So, she's just mechanically amazing. And bonkers when you start talking about her sphere-match with cards like Herugrim, UC and Snowmane. But she's also just FUN. Her ability is powerful, but feels organic and fun rather than mechanical (Elrond especially come to mind here). 

 

Lore: Ally Elrond. Not super-powerful but I love it thematically as he bounces in, heals some terrible wound or gives some sage advice (card draw), and then bounces out. Also--condition removal is always important. 

 

Neutral: Okay--I'll say what everyone else is avoiding. GANDALF! He is just such a key part of the lore and the game ever since Core. The question is which Gandalf? Core is probably the most powerful if only because of his versatility and the existence of Sneak Attack. And while I didn't like him at first I have grown to appreciate OHaUH Gandalf in a post-Spirit Merry world. But the Gandalf I find myself having the most fun with recently is Hero Gandalf. His ability is interesting without feeling too mechanical, he's undeniably powerful (as he should be--and you pay for it in threat) and his attachments and spell are wonderfully thematic. Love him.

Barring obvious cards like Steward, Test of Will, Daeron's Runes, etc

 

Leadership: Sword that Was Broken. Except for Silvans and Dwarves, I build around this card in every Leadership deck I make. Also, Galadriel. Such an underrated card, she became a staple almost as soon as she was released.

 

Spirit: Gamling. I don't even own him yet, but he is so good in the Rohan deck. Kind of a shame you never end up using his stats, but he combos so well with so many allies.

 

Lore: Lembas quickly became a staple in many of my Lore decks. Maybe not as good as Wingfoot, but still a very good uility card.

 

Tactics: Rohan Warhorse. One of the most fun Tactics cards they've ever released. I would love to see one for blocking, but that's a bit weird thematically.

## 31 [DukeWellington on November 23, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1905137)

When sword thain comes out I will make Gamling a hero and put UC on him so I can use those stats or reuse his ability.

I am cheating a bit but I'm gonna pick my favorite card of each sphere per card type (excluding heroes).

 

Leadership: Gimli (okay maybe Faramir too), Steward of Gondor, We Are Not Idle

Lore: Erebor Hammersmith, Legacy of Durin, Daeron's Runes

Spirit: Northern Tracker, Unexpected Courage (I suppose), A Test of Will

Tactics: Eagles of the Misty Mountains, Gondorian Shield, Feint

Neutral: Treebeard, Gandalf's Staff, A Good Harvest

I would disagree actually. Snowbourn Scout is universal, whereas the Squire is only useful if you have a Gondor hero to receive the resource. OK, Steward grants the trait, but if a hero already has Steward attached they don't generally need even more resources. That point of progress continues to be ever-useful though. Snowbourn Scout I pretty much put in any deck with Leadership by default, but I can't say the same for the Squire.

LIke the deck a lot. I have a similar deck, but with Elrond and Glorfindel (spirit), and plans for letting Beorn sacrifice himself in order to build the ent army quicker.

Leadership: Citadel Custodian. When you play heavy-Gondor in multiplayer, this guy always his the table for 0 and then use him to Very Good Tale some more allies.

Lore: Ithilien Lookout. Just the art, the utility of the card even outside of secrecy is great, good stat overall, that guy swings for 3 when Leadership Boromir is on the table.

Spirit: Helm! Helm! (honorable mention to Light the Beacons). That event is SO thematic, just like Forth Eorlingas! Ride Them Down or Charge of the Rohirrim. Those three others being less playable than Helm! helm!

Tactics: Honour Guard. Repeatable damage cancellation in tactics, 'nough said.

I see where you're coming from but don't know if I agree. Think it really just comes down to deck-construction style :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Personally, if I'm going to build a deck with chumping in mind, I'm gonna build it to CHUMP (and get maximum benefit from doing so). That means the deck will almost certainly have Prince Imrahil at the front (as well as Valiant Sacrifice and PROBABLY Eomer and some Eagles since they love to leave play). Now to be fair, I usually end up running both Snowbourn Scout AND Squire of the Citadel in this kind of deck, but I'm USUALLY happier to see Squire simply because there may or may not be a location in play but I can ALWAYS use the extra resource. And if I'm running Eomer, HE usually gets the Steward to pay for expensive Eagles so it can work as resource fixing too. 

 

Otherwise I would rather just rely on strong utility defenders and readying effects to guard my board and try to avoid having to chump whenever possible. 

 

Now if I was just running a generic deck and wanted to sprinkle in a little chumpyness as some added protection early game (and didn't have a Gondor hero, obviously) then I would probably agree with you. But it still sucks to drop a Scout and not have him fire because there's not a location in play (very possible in 1 or 2 player).

I have noticed that many players seems to like that steward of Gondor card. I strongly disagree about this, not that it's a bad card, actually it's too good in my opinion (a lot of other people think same too). I think i have read somewhere about that this card should be errated but i don't remember where it was. Anyways here is why i don't like it: It costs only 2 resources which you will get right back when you have bought it, then next turn it starts to make a great amount of profit and after few turns you will swim in money. I think it would be better that it would give only 1 resource per turn unless it's attached to Denethor in which case it would give that 2 resources instead. 

 

Also sorry if i explained kinda unclearly but you know what i mean.

Yeah... unless attached to a hero that doesn't even shares a sphere with it, great idea.

 

The problem of cards like Steward of Gondor is not that they are strong, but that they are universal at what they do, essentially hindering any further effort to add similar kind of effect.

 

Another fine example is the release of Dain Ifornfoot, sole existance of which put a huge dent on all dwarf ally attacks and willpowers, while making dwarf decks without leadership much harder to pull off.

## 46 [NathanH on November 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1909577)

I imagine if they knew then what they know now, the designers wouldn't have made Steward of Gondor anywhere near as powerful as it is. It would either be weaker, more expensive, or more restricted. I think it sticks out in the Core Set as particularly overpowered.

 

Staple cards like Test of Will, Hasty Stroke, Feint, are not exactly super overpowered, but they do have the problem that it's quite hard to make cards with similar effects that don't make you think "yeah, sure, but why not just play the Core Set card", because they are cheap and unrestricted.

 

I think Unexpected Courage is just about OK. The fact it costs 2 at least gives some space for cheap readying cards. But I might be deceived because we only have 2 core sets available to us, so we can't rely on getting Unexpected Courage.

100% agree on Steward. Dain...not so much. 

 

Dain is crazy-powerful, no-doubt. But I think the difference is that Dain can encourages interesting deck-building and coordination between players where Steward usually doesn't.

 

I don't play Dwarves solo so maybe he feels more restricting in that setting but in multiplayer games I have never found him restraining. He's one hero slot, but there aren't a bunch of other great Dwarf cards that do the same thing that he is holding back. And while there ARE other really good Leadership Dwarf heroes, I don't see Balin or Thorin suffering that much as both can stand on their own merits. 

 

And if the argument is just, it's hard to build a Dwarf deck without Leadership...well, yeah. But that would be true without him since their best cards are all Leadership. And the same can be said for Rangers/Ents and Lore.  

## 48 [John Constantine on November 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1909760)

Let me elaborate. Dain is a hero that buffs every dwarf across the board with +1 willpower and +1 attack.

The restriction is that every dwarf ally and hero being designed must take that into account. And it will result in an overall willpower/attack descrease across the dwarves to compensate for potential growth out of proportion. Which is not a problem by itself, but if you want to build a dwarf deck outside of leadership, you're stuck with underpowered (for the purpose of Dains sole existance) dwarf allies and no access to make up for it. And that's why Dain is restrictive, he literally nerfs every dwarf before their release.

In theory, yes. But have you seen this in practice? If you look at the list of dwarves we have, most of them follow the general "X cost 2X stats" curve that we see across the board, if not better. Sure, there are some duds (I'm looking at you Bombur ally), but every other trait has duds too.

 

That upcoming Dwarven Sellsword doesn't feel shortchanged for stats either...

Yeah, Dwarf allies are fine without Dain, and then Dain makes them better. And I strongly disagree with the claim that he encourages interesting deck-building. The 5 dwarf stuff from the Hobbit boxes, the deck-mining sub-theme of the trait, these encourage interesting deck-building. With Dain, you just spam a bunch of allies which were already good and they become even better with no effort on your part beyond that one hero choice.

Pretty much stole the words from my brain. The average dwarf really doesn't feel under-powered. And the Sellsword looks hella-sexy. 

 

To @John Constantine's point though, Dain may be preemptively nerfing the HIGH end of the Dwarf allies and Heroes. I could see FFG intentionally holding back just a bit ASSUMING that Dain would be in play when balancing a more powerful character (I feel like the new Dori may have fallen a little foul of this...) but the average dwarf is no pushover without Dain when looked at in the context of the whole cardpool.

That's actually pretty fair. You COULD do that. I think it would bite you pretty bad in a number of quests but it would work okay for a lot of them. 

 

I find Dain an interesting card to build around precisely because his effect is universal. As someone who plays the game pretty much exclusively with people who don't own it, I end up building everyone's decks myself to compliment eachother. That can present interesting decisions. 

 

There are only so many Dwarves—how do I distribute them? Do I focus on the cheapest/weakest allies possible to leverage Dain to his maximum effect or bank on some of the slightly more expensive allies--and that's before we make room for some of the great Dwarf attachments and events. Leadership has the best Dwarf cards, how do I distribute them assuming Dain will be anchoring one Hero slot going in. Do I go Mono-Leadership for that deck and restrict the allies I can drop or give up Thorin or Balin (both great cards). 

 

Maybe it’s the way I build my decks (always building each one to compliment all the others with a single cardpool) but to me he DOES generate some interesting choices along with all the other Dwarf mechanics you mentioned.

Let's take a look!

 

Spirit:

All, except for unique Bofur, spirit dwarf allies have 1 willpower, and 1 or less attack. Is that not a pattern enough for you? None of the spirit dwarf heroes has any of his willpower or attack stats above 2, and none of them has both his willpower and attack at 2 simultaneously and unconditioanlly.

 

Lore: 

Not a single 2 willpower ally. Only 2 allies out of 8 have an attack value of 2, both are unique. Lore dwarf heroes don't have nenither willpower, nor attack exceeding 2 (one of heroes even has 0 willpower and 1 attack).

 

Tactics: 

Tactic dwarf allieas at least can provide you with some decent attack without Dain, but if you wanna take them questing - you'll be vaguely dissapointed.

You would think tactics dwarf heroes would shine in this department? Nope. Not a single wp/atk stat above 2, quite some are obviously below.

 

So this is not irony, it's harsh reality. Most of dwarf allies (and quite some heroes) suck stats-wise unless Dain is in play to compensate. 

 

The upcoming Dwarven Sellsword drains your resources consistently, and that's why he has such inflated attack/willpower. Hindering him because of Dain's existance would be completely blasphemous, because he is obviously not supposed to be used solely for dwarf decks, but for any leadership deck that can use some kickstarting. Thanks god they didn't pre-rendered him for dwarfs only (though decision to make him a dwarf is questionable, as they could have just made him some non-developed trait to be completely neutral trait-effect wise, but this one benefits dwarf players who are going to use him, so it's ok).

## 53 [DukeWellington on November 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910103)

It can be difficult to demonstrate with specifics (as every detail can begin it's own rabbit trail debate) but in essence I agree with John Constantine. The point he is making is about game design not game balance. The problem with a lot of cards is not that they are overpowered but that they prohibit future design. The designers eventually back themselves into a corner.

Let me use the example of Northern Tracker. His ability is necessary to prevent landlock, especially in 3 or 4 player games. In solo he can often be overpriced and unnecessary. So, I would not say he is overpowered. Instead, his existence makes it extremely difficult for any other location control type card to exist. The only card that breaks through this is Asfaloth. Maybe with Gamling the Rohan tribe can provide competition, but basically whenever you see a location control card you think "well I can just run Norther Tracker".

Consider a hypothetical alternative which illustrates the point. Let's say that in the Mirkwood cycle they decided to focus on locations with the "river" and "riverland" trait (which they did) or "forest". Then they made a card exactly like Northern Tracker but it only placed progress on river or riverland locations. Immediately all kinds of design space opens up because now you can have a "Southern Tracker" for marshland or mordor locations. You can have a character that puts progress on "city" locations for quests like trouble at Pelegrir or Tharbad. Unfortunately those cards really can't exist because Norhern Tracker blocks their design. By making Northern Tracker universal it severely limits the ability for designers to make creative cards.

This is why a card is more bland the more universal it becomes. Imagine if Dain gave his boost to all allies instead of just Dwarves. It would completely ruin the game. Not because Dain would be too powerful, but because it would become extremely difficult to design alternatives. That is John's point. That is why I agree with him about Steward of Gondor. It should have had some kind of restriction. Treebeard should not be able to rule Gondor.

All fair points. And as I said before I agree 100% on Steward. 

 

And @Jon Constantine makes some good points. I usually only play Dwarves in Dwarf decks where their real strength is their synergy (with or without Dain) so I don't know if a stat-for-stat reckoning is really a fair test but it does certainly illustrate the point of diminishing design space. 

 

Still...I like Dain. And it's not even a matter of his power but the way he works. I can understand if I'm in the minority there though. 

 

I think I may just be blinded by my own very different experience with Dain. When I played him regularly he was in a pair of purpose-built 100% theme decks that required some clever deck building due to not having access to a lot of the staple non-dwarf cards (Steward included, but also all non-dwarf allies and any attachments and/or events referencing specific non-dwarf items or events). 

## 55 [Seastan on November 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910250)

Apart from Ents, Dwarves have the highest stats/cost of any trait.

 

Ents: 3.76
Dwarves: 1.99 (Not including Sellsword)
Eagles: 1.94 (Not including Vassal/Guardian)
Rohan: 1.92
Gondor: 1.88
Noldor: 1.83 (Not including Elrond/Galadriel)
Dunedain: 1.79 (Not including Hunter)
Silvan: 1.72

 

So Dwarves have the best bang for your buck even without Dain. Dain takes them from "very good" to "insanely good", but let it not be said that Dwarves are "underpowered" without him.

 

I'm not making a comment on whether or not I think Dain is a good design. I am just trying to straighten out the facts.

## 56 [DukeWellington on November 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910280)

Incorrect. Outlands is best tribe.

## 57 [DukeWellington on November 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910288)

Again, debating raw numbers is challenging because context and abilities matter so much. Rohan and Gondor tribes are near the top while Silvan is at the bottom, yet I think everyone agrees that Silvan is the better tribe.

How does Ithilian Tracker, or Dunedain Wanderer, or Silvan Refugee, or Rivendale Scout, Pelegrir Shipwright, or Harbor Master, or Citadel Custodian, or many other cards skew the numbers when the stats/cost ratio is misleading?

Health is almost never as valuable as attack, so if a tribe gets a boost by having higher health it won't tell the real story (Silvan are low health, which is one reason they outperform their stat/cost ratio). A minion with well rounded stats is not as good as a minion with specialized stats (one resonance wandering ent is not actually a very good ally). So dwarves get a big boost from an ally like erebor Hammersmith because he has a lot of stats, but they are all spread out (and he has 3 health!) but his stats are not actually that impressive.

Then, should you count allies that nobody ever uses?

My point is that you can't just clear this debate up with raw numbers. I think the Dwarf tribe is strong even without Dain because of cards like Legacy of Durin, Lure of Moria, Erebor Battlemaster, and We are Not Idle.

That is why the question of design space is the more interesting one to me :-)

## 58 [Seastan on November 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1910306)

Of course there is more to it than just raw stats. But that's all that Dain provides. The point was that Dwarves are not shortchanged in stats because of Dain, that's all. I completely agree that Legacy of Durin, Lure of Moria, and We are not Idle make the Dwarf tribe one of the strongest archetypes even without a global stat boost.

 

With Faramir and Erebor Battle Master a dwarf deck will not be lacking in willpower or attack. Dain is an easier option, sure. Boromir also makes building Gondor decks a lot easier, Theoden for Rohan, Hirluin for Outlands. But you can still put together solid decks without them. Silvan is an interesting case, because it seems they are pretty dependent on Celeborn, and perhaps the reason they are still good despite their low stat/cost. But I will not say that Silvan are underpowered without him at this point.

You're avoiding my point, which was the dent that sole Dain's existance puts on willpower and attack of all dwarves coming out. Comparing the cost efficiency of entire statbox won't do it justice. For example, as I've stated previously, out of entire Lore dwarf roster, only two dwarves have attack above 1 (both unique, both have 2 attack, so it's not that much), and none have above 1 willpower. And Lore contains the most dwarf allies, mind you. Out of 5 Spirit (willpower rich sphere, so to say) dwarf allies, only single one possess more than 1 willpower, and he is, of course, unique.

 

It is got harder to build out-of-leadership thematic dwarf decks without Dain in them, because all dwarves that came out were designed with Dain in mind. They simply lack the stats you need to progress through the quest and not get eaten in the process.

I'm gonna slap a big ol' [Citation needed] on that. You have nothing but your own perception to back up the idea that the Dwarf allies' stats were downgraded to account for Dain, and given that their stats are, as noted, not just credible but good for their cost (not to mention some very useful abilities) I find it hard to believe that assertion.

And the suggestion that Dwarves "lack the stats you need to progress through the quest" I find untrue on the basis of direct experience, because I've used those allies in decks without Dain and found them to be fine.

 

Also, spread of stats can be way more useful than most people give it credit for.

My last response wasn't that great as I think about it because I answered within the paradigm of game balance instead of design. Again, the problem is not that Dwarves are not as good as other tribes. The problem is that you can't make the Dwarves too good because of Dain.

I am not sure how you can provide scholarly citation to show that Dwarves are pretty nerfed, but let's use what evidence is available. The designers don't reveal their behind the door processes, but they do change their design methods over time. Celeborn is an interesting case study because he came so much later. Rather than giving a bland global bonus, he boosts stats only on the first turn. This makes it so that you can have big expensive stat monster silvan without damaging the meta. In fact, Celeborn actually encourages people to play with cheap silvan allies that can be more easily bounced and replayed. Small cheap allies that get buffed temporarily are far less problematic and restrictive to future design possibilities. They are free to still design pretty much any Silvan they want to. I believe that Celeborn is a vastly superior design and if they could do it over again the designers would have done something less restrictive to future design with Dain. Another evidence is Theoden as the tribal leader for Rohan. He reduces cost instead of granting a global buff. With experiance they get better at design. I am not sure how this is all that debatable.

By the way, Dain does not just limit the design of characters but also attachments. Obviously they could not have an attachment like "visionary leadership" for dwarves. Once you have filled that design space you can't fill it again. It is better to divide the space into four or five cards rather than to make one grand card. Again, if Dain gave his buff to all allies then Leadership Boromir could not exist (and visionary leadership could not exist if Boromir was like Dain). That's the point.

Anyone up for a challenge to build a dwarf deck sans Dain and/or even sans Leadership? I' skeptical myself to be honest. Dain is just too good. I have no doubt that the designers have Dain in the back of their minds when they design a new dwarf (poor hero Dori :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ). That's just my gut feeling though.

PocketWraith makes a good point about personal experience. I have played Dwarf decks without Dain and found them to still be one of the most powerful traits. But lets keep arguing because game analysis is fun  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  
 

>  
> 
> >  
> 
> You're avoiding my point, which was the dent that sole Dain's existance puts on willpower and attack of all dwarves coming out. Comparing the cost efficiency of entire statbox won't do it justice. For example, as I've stated previously, out of entire Lore dwarf roster, only two dwarves have attack above 1 (both unique, both have 2 attack, so it's not that much), and none have above 1 willpower. And Lore contains the most dwarf allies, mind you. Out of 5 Spirit (willpower rich sphere, so to say) dwarf allies, only single one possess more than 1 willpower, and he is, of course, unique.

There are only 5 spirirt dwarf allies. You shouldn't draw sweeping conclusions about nerfs from such a small set. This is especially true when you look at those allies individually:

 
Bofur - One of the best questers in the game.
Blue Mountain Trader - Designed with his ability in mind as his primary use, which was so good it had to be nerfed. Him having 2 willpower on top of that would make him crazy powerful, as all the spirit allies with 2 willpower and 2 health are unique.
Dwalin - A sentinel defender not designed for questing. The only Sentinel allies will two willpower cost 1 extra.
Kili - I'm going to go ahead and say that nobody plays this guy without Fili, so he should be thought of as having essentially double his stats.
Zigil Miner - We all know this guy would get played with no stats whatsoever.
 
It seems that the spirit dwarves allies are not even part of the dwarf swarm archtype, with the exception of Kili who normally comes into play from the leadership Fili. So I wouldn't expect them to be designed with Dain in mind anyway.
 
As for lore, the average attack for an ally (not including Ents or Elrond, but I am including Quickbeam) is exactly 1. It's lower if you discount Quickbeam who is considered to be overpowered. The average attack for a lore dwarf ally (not including Record Keeper who cannot attack) is also exactly 1. It's almost like Dain has had no affect at all. The average lore ally willpower is just 1.05 so it's not like only having 1 is a huge loss. And when you consider the abilities most of the dwarf allies have (the Map-maker has given me enormous willpower boosts) it's another moot point.

I've done quite a bit of research here so I'm not going to be swayed by vague feelings of nerfness. Show me some hard numbers that indicate Dwarves are nerfed. You don't even have to prove that Dain is the cause. I just want to see something concrete because everything I look at (including personal experience) is telling me dwarves are just as strong, if not stronger, than other factions.
 
If your point is that they can't make expensive stat monster dwarves anymore, then back it up with some examples, like how Gimli and Dwarven Sellsword don't exist  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] (Sorry for for the sarcasm). I think the only other recent dwarf is the Longbeard Sentry who is a defender and unaffected by Dain in that regard.
 
You other comments about design space I agree with . Celeborn is certainly a lot more fun to use. But that's not really what we are discussing here.

Seastan, these are all spirit dwarves I have, I cannot avoid them if I am to build a dwarf deck without leadership. And spirit dwarves are not the only example I provided.

 

Bofur is also the only card from Spirit dwarves to feature more than of 1 willpower or attack. 

Blue Mountain Trader's ability was not good, it was poorly designed (in terms of exploit-proofness), and the fix (not nerf) was coming as soon as he hit the shelves. And his ability is purely multiplayer-related, so for example, if you're playing solo (which is major case because I'm discussing the life without Dain), you're looking at an ally with empty text box, 1 wp and 0 atk. For 2 resources. 2 hp would have matter, if he had any impact, but he doesn't, unfortunately.

Dwalin - well guess why he is not designed for questing? Because Dain exists! With Dain, Dwalin is a 2/2/2/3 monster, capable of anything. They wouldn't dare to give him any excess willpower or attack, or with Dain he would grow out of proportion.

Kili - look at this fine example of Dain influence. Brothers are essentially the same, with different pictures and colors. They couldn't make blue one quest for more and purple one attack for more, for example, because with Dain - they would be doing too much on their own.

Zigil - still, he is a dwarf, and any player who wants some dwarf action going on is going to consider him. And will get dissapointed.

 

I just checked all lore allies on the cardgame db, and they have pretty decent stat boxes attack and sometimes even willpower-wise, apart from the ones who have some utility going on with them. Far better than unmodified dwarves. Something I certainly can use without Dain sticking around. 

 

They ARE designed with Dain in mind, every dwarf is, because if they wouldn't - their stats wouldn't be so critically small. And that's the problem with stuff like Dain (an inderect proof to my words is lack of global unconditional faction-related stat boosts like Dain throughout all these cycles - they don't wanna make that mistake again).

 

I got it - you do not agree with me. But please - these huge text-wall arguments are putting straing on me, so if you're having intentions of arguing this further, then you can call me on skype or something. That would save the hell of a time for both of us, I'm convinced.

I'm sure how to respond to your analysis other than to just say there is some fundamental disconnect going on here. Fili and Kili get you 2 WP, 2 Atk, 1 Def, 4 HP for the cost of 3. This is just plain good. And Dwalin is a sentinel with 2 defence and 3 HP that you normally only pay 1 for! How much more can you ask? You want Dwalin to be a 1 cost 2/2/2/3 sentinel defender? Come on. 

 

Edit: Do people think that the upcoming Dwarven Sellsword would be 1 cost for 3/3/2/3 if Dain didn't exist?

Also, asking for a dwarf deck without leadership is a whole different level of a request than asking for a deck without Dain. You are asking us to give up a very good tale, we are not idle, hardy leadership, narvi's belt, and lure of moria, not to mention Thorin, Balin, and Gloin.

To be honest I am feeling strained here as well myself, putting a great deal of work analyzing the entire card pool and putting out some hard numbers. I understand no one is asking me to, but if you enjoy having these numbers to look at and work with, then brushing them off by handpicking a couple allies or saying "outlands is the best" is not going to keep me interested in continuing to provide such data (Duke, I know you followed that up with more points but it was a silly counterargument nonetheless).

Without Dain is easy. Thorin/Ori/Bombur can make for a pretty great Dwarf deck. Without Leadership may be more difficult if you want it to be definitely a Dwarf deck as opposed to just a deck with Dwarf heroes and a number of Dwarf allies, but I think there are probably some cases that could work.

See, these are your opinions and guesses at the reasons behind the design, not the objective facts you're trying to tout them as. Dwalin wasn't designed for questing because they wanted him to be a combat character. Fili and Kili have the same stats because the designers wanted them to have the same stats.

And personally, I've made plenty of use of the Zigil Miner and the Lore Dwarf allies without Dain. We have started getting some better Lore allies in more recent packs, but I'd still rate the Dwarves pretty well.

No, that is actually exactly what has happened. You disregarding it does not mean it didn't happen.

 

I certainly agree with DukeWellington that Dain is not as good or as interesting a design as Celeborn or Spirit Theoden, and I can see the point about design space being limited by putting too much into him back then. I just don't really think it has particularly negatively impacted the Dwarf allies that have been released. I think that by and large the designers give allies of all traits the stats they want those allies to have.

Not, it's not what happened. My point was Dain hurts willpower and attack of all dwarves coming out, leaving a lot of lacking allies with no actual way to help you progress without Dain around, which I proved statisticly by providing the numbers. What Seastan did is he threw in defense and healt, both irrelevant to my argument stats. Neither defense nore health help you progress, they help you stall. And Dain does not hurts them either, because he does not affects them.

We played the Hobbit sage with two dwarf decks and no Dain (5 dwarf heroes + Bard). We didn't find ourselves lacking for Willpower or Attack (Defence was a problem). The one thing I would say is that apart from Thorin the heroes are a bit meh in terms of stats without Dain.

Well, if you want to go down that road...

 

If we are going to evaluate stats, let's do it the proper way. We must take into account that there are unique allies, and non-unique allies, and that there cannot be more than 1 unique ally in play at once. (And let's drop the fact that various unique dwarf allies share names with dwarf heroes and even with each other, dropping their effectiveness even further).

 

Hence what we'll do is take each non-unique ally and multiply it's count and willpower by 3, while leaving unique ones alone.

 

The numbers will shock you:

Rohan: 40 willpower across 36 allies=1.11
Dwarf: 39 willpower across 50 allies =0,78
 
A little bit more bitter details:
 
Spirit Dwarves:
Cost: 17.5/9=1.94
Willpower: 10/9=1.11
Attack: 6/9=0.67
 
Lore Dwarves:
Cost: 38/18=2.11
Willpower: 14/18=0.77
Attack: 13/18=0.72
 
 
Please, once again, if you want to discuss it further - let's make it in some place it won't take so many time to express our opinions.

I love them too, but to make progress on the quest, to win in and to not threat out - you need willpower (unless it's siege, but it's a whole different story). To prevent enemies piling on on you (and eventually overrunning you, as there might be more enemies than you have defenders), you need attack. Defending is good, but without anything to strike back, the defense is just a stall for defeat.

The Outlands comment was meant ad a joke. However, underlying the joke was a deeper point that base stats/cost ratios don't give an accurate picture.

As I have said, and maybe this is where John and I have some disagreement, my point is not that Dwarves have been nerfed comparatively to other tribes. My point is that Dain limits design. That is why I made the point about Visionary Leadership, because that example seems to make my point totally obvious.

Now Seastan asked a good question, "what more do you expect?" Well, John actually answered it, but I will restate it. The point is to have a low cost ally with 3 willpower or 3 attack (not both, one or the other). In other words, an ally that specializes in questing or attacking. Now the Dwarves have the attacker (Erebor Battlemaster) in a dedicated Dwarf deck, but not a quester. In contrast, Ents have Quickbeam to attack and Wellinghall has 3 willpower. So, IMO, with Ents they would not give a global buff like that which Dain provides. They have gone in a different dirrection, using the "comes into play exhausted" to compensate. So, it's either global buff or high stats, but you can't have both. If you do, the result is OP, like... Outlands.

First off, I appreciate the time it took you to collect these numbers. I'd be happy to take this off the forums, but I think some people are genuinely interested in seeing these numbers.

 

The only way I see of getting 40 willpower with Rohan allies is to count Escort from Edoras as 4 each. If this is what we need to do to make Rohan look good then sure, but it's pretty cheesy.

 

You seem fixated on the spirit dwarves when there are only 5 of them. I reject "statistics" based on them on mathematical grounds, and have already discussed each of them individually. None of them would be balanced cards with an extra attack and willpower.
 
Have you guys ever experimented with Longbead Map-Maker? Whether your engine is Steward, We are not Idle, or Zigil Miners, this guy is capable of advancing through quest stages single-handedly.

 

And we all know the power of the Erebor Battle Master, who is unmatched in combat and gets hidden by these statistics. Dwarves do not need more attack strength.

## 84 [John Constantine on November 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194127-favorite-card-per-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=1911305)

I counted Escort from Edoras because it's +2 wp is unconditional, it requires no addional engineering. Even if I remove those 6 willpower it provided to the statistics, Rohan would be 0.94, which is way above the dwarves. Interesting thing, if I throw off those 7 lore/leadership allies which are rarely used in any rohan decks due to being off-sphere, the rohan becomes: 39/29=1.34(33/29=1.13 without +2 on Edoras) in terms of willpower. 

 

Why do you thinj I'm so fixated on spirit Dwarves? There are 3 spirit dwarf heroes (meaning that I can try to build monospirit dwarf deck (and fail miserably)), two of which imply the dwarf synergy, from which one implies connection to tactics, And while the tactics dwarves perform decently in combat, spirit dwarves suck at questing.

 

Both Steward and We Are Not Idle are leadership, which means Dain. Erratad Miners won't bring you much resources (and might even bring none at all if you're unlucky).

 

I'll correct your last sentence: Dwarves do not need more attack strength in Tactics.

Oh, of course, it's not like there are three other Leadership Dwarf heroes you could use...

I see we have dropped to the level of considering Dwalin as a legitimate hero  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] (Just kidding).

 

Oin is clearly not meant to be put in a mono spirit deck.
 
Sure, you can technically try to put the three spirit dwarves into a mono spirit deck anyway, and I agree you will fail miserably. So? Just because there are three heroes of a certain trait in a sphere does not automatically mean that the designers have made the mono-sphere option viable for that trait. A mono lore Noldor deck would also be bad, as would a secrecy mono spirit Gondor deck with Eleanor and Caldara. 
 
If your point is that some traits are more heavily tied to certain spheres than others, then I agree. That's just how the designers have made the game. In the case of Dwarves, even without Dain, they probably expect most players would see Narvi's Belt, Hardy Leadership, We Are not Idle, and Lure of Moria, and King Under the Mountain all in the Leadership sphere and think "Hey, maybe I should use some Leadership cards in my Dwarf deck."
 

My issue wasn't with sphere balance. It was with this: 

 

> They ARE designed with Dain in mind, every dwarf is, because if they wouldn't - their stats wouldn't be so critically small.

 

This is such a huge claim, especially the "every dwarf" part. Look at the dwarves we have and add a willpower and attack to them but keep the cost the same. They become overpowered and destroy the cost curve of the game. Zigil miner with 2/2/1/1, Fili and Kili at 2/2/1/2, potential 1-cost allies Bofur at 3/2/1/3 and Dwalin at 2/2/2/3 sentinel. There is just no sign that these allies would've had more stats without Dain because it would break the cost curve they have used with every other trait.

Yes, but if you'll try to combine Oin with anything but leadership, because lore dwarves suck across both atk and wp, tactics dwarves are good with attack but have no wp, and spirit dwarves themselves are not much of neither willpower nor attack (remember, I judge this one purely on solo experience, this all argument gets negated if we have a second player with Dain in his deck).

 

I'll go into a little bit more detail here: Nori and Oin both imply dwarf tribing happening, but we can't combine spirit with anything but leadership and hope to be successful, because without Dain, none of this decks would have sufficient stats to perform, this is not a mono-spirit talk. More of it, most disastrous combination would be lore+spirit dwarves, which would have decent amount of dwarves and stuff.

 

My point is and was all along: Dain's existance hurts all Dwarf characters willpower and attack, essentially killing any attempts at Dwarfs without Dain in solo (I'm sure there is some clever stuff one can do to make something like this work, but I'm also sure that it will be mostly due to not dwarf related stuff). I think that Dwarves could have been much more interesting and self-efficient archetype that exists in all spheres (and is at least somewhat viable in most spheres and combinations), if a staple like Dain would not exist. And then and now every Dwarf coming out is getting double-evaluated due to Dain and turns out a little bit weaker because of him. Staples like him hurt the future game design possibilities.

 

Adding willpower and attack together is not a right way to do it, because a character that has 2 willpower and 0 attack (or vice versa) provides a meaningful impact on his own, while a 1 willpower 1 attack character can be barely felt and won't make huge difference by his very presence. Well, I did not sey that without Dain they would have stats just like they have with Dain, but some of them could have that 1 missing point of stat in a right place to make them valuable picks for non-Dain decks (and make them tremendously powerful for their cost with Dain).

A few solo dwarf decks have already been posted that don't use Dain. Are they underpowered? That's subjective, but as someone who plays with powerful decks a lot I'd have to say no.

 

Adding even a single stat point of stats to most dwarf allies still upsets the cost curve. Many of the allies already get more than double their cost in stats (Especially true when you consider that allies like Bofur, Dwalin, and Fili/Kili are cheaper than they appear).

 

Silvan need to be high in a single stat because the are going to come down and do 1 action before leaving. Dwarves are a different design with a higher spread of stats and more durable, offering flexibility from round to round. Maybe you just don't like that playstyle.

I can't say much on that account until I see them performing decently against some non-pushover quests.

 

It might be [in some cases] even a matter of shifting a stat point, rather than adding it, that can make a huge difference.

 

Also, I find it funny that the only non-unique dwarf ally in the game with wp above 1 is in leadship. He also scries [lore] and places progress [spirit]  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

> Zigil Miner - We all know this guy would get played with no stats whatsoever.

 

With 0 hit points it would be tough, though not impossible, strangely, to get him into play :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Guys, what did you do to this thread? :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

Well, the Thorin Ori Oin deck I posted beat Carn Dum quite handily on the first attempt, but I think I can make it better. Never ended up using Oin's tactics resource so maybe Nori is better. Swap out those Longbeard Sentries for A Good Harvest to get Battlemasters into play. Here: http://goo.gl/3sUKhs [http://goo.gl/3sUKhs]

 

At some point maybe I'll make a video of a non-Dain dwarf deck, but I have a long list of decks to showcase already...

Why Good Harvest? Just use Narvi's belt!

My money on the cost difference of 2.
