New to the game... don't know what I have been doing all my life, a vagrant on the distant shores of unfulfilling games...

 

So, any news on new printing for old packs? The first adventures of Shadow of Mirkwood are already hard to find. Will The Hunt for Gollum be print again?

Absolutely it will be. This is one of FFG's most popular sellers, so they're routinely running out of stock and reprinting. Generally takes a few months, though. If you want, there's no problem skipping ahead to the Khazad-Dum/Dwarrowdelf cycle. If those are on reprint as well, try the Saga boxes. I wouldn't recommend skipping straight to the Against the Shadow/Heirs of Numenor cycle. It's notoriously difficult for inexperienced players with a weaker card pool.
