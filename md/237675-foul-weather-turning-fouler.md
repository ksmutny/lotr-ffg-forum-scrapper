Re Flight Of The Stormcaller

Just wondering... If I'm right on this:

After the quest Full Sail Ahead gains it's 12th progress token at the end of the round the next stage is revealed... The Weather Turns Foul... As it's still the end of the round the new Forced action taken effect immediately?

Typically, a Forced or Response effect on a card won't activate for a trigger that happened before the card was actually in play. "End of round" is a slightly awkward trigger, but my feeling is that the sanest answer is that the new effect doesn't trigger.

We've had clarifications on effects such as this before. Â If the Forced effect was not in play when the trigger occurred (in this case, it was not), it will not trigger.

There is the case though where you can play Foe-hammer and draw into another Foe-hammer, and still be able to play the second copy even though it wasn't in your hand during the original trigger. But cards in your hand aren't really in play anyway so it's a little different. I just wanted to mention it.
