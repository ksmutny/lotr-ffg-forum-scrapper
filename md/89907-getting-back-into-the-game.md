I picked up this game about a year ago or so (core set and 1 adventure pack). I really liked it in that I could play solo. That said, I haven't played it much the last 8 or so months as I started a new job (took up my free time) and was playing a lot of the Warhammer LCG (we prefer the heads-up as opposed to co-op play).

 

Well, he's moved away and I started playing this more. I am in a place where I can drop a little moola here - just wanting advice on what to buy. I figured I should just finish off the first cycle and get Kaza-Dum, and grow from there in chronological order. Is this the best way?

 

Where do the saga expansions fit in? Are they necessary to the overall story? Are they a must have?

 

Also - what are thoughts on mixed sphere decks? I seem to like not mixing (though core set Aragorn is nice to mix) but wanted any feedback.

 

Thanks!

this, to me, is the best source on the subject:

mixing spheres is almost a necessity, i think. or at least playing two decks solo of different spheres. especially when there is a limited card pool (hard to make solid mono-sphere decks with just the core and one AP).

 

the sagas are replaying the books - they are not tied thematically into any of the other APs.

You should also get the upcoming Black Riders saga expansion if you like hobbits at all. It's coming out in the next few weeks and you only need the core set to play. It is also the first saga expansion for the Lord of the Rings.

here's a quick guide based on my experience from playing from the start of the game

 

-go in order if you can get the packs. there really isnt much reason not to. i think if you start picking out certain quests you lose the storyline. i used to think this wasnt so much of a problem, but it appears ffg are starting to put more emphasis on narrative with story pages (which is good)

 

-this game has changed a lot in the last year or so- new keywords, abilities and races. multisphere deck building still remains the way to successfully build decks in my belief, however ffg are starting to make single sphere decks much better in the current gondor cycle.

 

-saga packs are not neccesary to the overall game but do add a great deal to the card pool. i would recommend getting them after you finish the dwarrowdelf cycle, which will complement your dwarf card pool nicely and will keep the order consistent with release, making the difficulty about right

Thanks all! I took your advice - just bought the rest of the first cycle and Khazad Dum. I'll grow from there!
