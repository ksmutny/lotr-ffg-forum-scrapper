As the title implies, I’m quit new to this game trying to master the rules.

 

Have this issue with Sneek attack during Quest phase or Actions during Planing Phase been official ruled yet?

You must play Sneak Attack during the quest phase before committing all characters to quest, because all characters are committed to questing all at once. Then, the allied that was put into play returns to your and at the end of the phase, juste before the travel phase starts.

 

To play Sneak attack during the planing phase means that the allied you played with Sneak Attack returns to your hand at the end of the phase, before the questing phase starts.

Seems like I have a bit of clarification to do.

To the point with Steward of Gondor. I have always read the phrase “Green – Any player can take actions generally…” with the meaning of “generally” as in most cases. The way we have we have dealt with rule issues in our play group is by asking us two question, what do we think is the intention of the rule is, and what’s more challenging. So we have always played it as you can’t take actions during the first step “ally and attachments” during the planning phase. But then I started to watch this podcast Cardboard of the ring, and they do actions in that step, and no one seems to react to that, so the little rule master in my head got the better of me so I’ve been searching in the very shallow waters of the internet for something that’s more legit then “a random dude on internet told me to do so”.

Thank you in advance!

You can take actions during any of the times highlighted green on pg 30 and 31 of the rulebook.  Using Steward of Gondor or playing sneak attack are actions, so you can do those during these action windows.

 

I think the more important part of that diagram is the red highlighting.  You can't take actions during the red things, but otherwise you can take as many actions as you want.

In fact, an ally card that says "Action : discard x cards to put this ally into play, etc" means that you can do the action to put into play the ally during any action window (outside the planing phase), like after engagement checks with ennemies and realizing to you have no defender, so the ally you just put into play can block (and die, most of the times).

 

Other example : you can play Warden of healing right after the combat phase to heal characters, so he's not exhausted during the questing phase in case a treachery card kills him and makes you flip the table over.

 

There is also an action windows right after the refresh phase, so you can re-exhaust Gandalf (or Saruman) and play Word of command to get a specific card before discard him, etc
