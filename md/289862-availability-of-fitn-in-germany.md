Living in Germay, playing the english version. A month ago I ordered theÂ three APs from the Ered Mithrin cycle. The Seller lists FitN still as "available in 5-10 days", so my cards did not arive until now. Anyone experience similar? Anyone has more detailed informations, e.g. container ship not dock?!

I had the same experience with the German version of Roam accross Rhovanion. I had to wait about 4 weeks, even though it was listed as available in 3-5 days, max. 2 weeks. As to why, I have no idea.
