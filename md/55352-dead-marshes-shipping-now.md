I'm very excited about the player cards in this pack!

My educated guess is that it will be available on Halloween, Oct. 31st. Hunting through the Dead Marshes on Halloween! What could be more thematic! For full effect put the Dead Marshes track from the Two Towers soundtrack on repeat, it's really spooky!

Yay! How clever of them, Dead Marshes on Halloween. I like it.

Boromir is about to walk hard like Dewey Cox.

This tread has a very misleading title... Shame on you fooling me to think that Dead Marshes is actually, really shipping now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

How is the thread mislead?  Dead Marshesis shipping from FFG warehouses to distributors.

I was assuming its on sale (like in "you can order it now and we're shipping it to you") but now I realize he meant the "shipping status" on the upcoming page...

I also thought you meant it was available to order. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I was scrambling trying to find where to order it.

Ah, sorry about that. I made sure to use the exact wording from the 'Upcoming' page to try and eliminate confusion but looks like it backfired!

I just wish I actually had a store near me that got "shipped to"! My store has to special order them after they're generally available and so I always end up getting mine at least a week after they're "In stores"

I live in Australia, and I'm still waiting for Emyn Muil to arrive at my local shop, It takes at least 3 weeks for shipping from the US so I get the expansions around 2-3 weeks after they hit stores over there. I know I could order online, but then I'd end up paying more I think.

Hey there, I too live in Australia.

I have purchased my cards through 3 different places now - one lcoal and two international.

I can say with clear certainty that Amazon has been the most reliable for timely delivery and reasonable cost. The only bummer with Amazon this time around is that they don't seem to have The Dead Marshes listed in their product list online.

I have purchased from this site direct, but USPS takes no less than 3 weeks...so if you want to stay local www.milsims.com.au [http://www.milsims.com.au] (based in Victoria) will get the cards to you within roughly the same time that it takes to get the cards from FFG direct. I have a friend who only buys through the above local supplier, and whislt he ahs receieved one of the expansions faster than me, I have beaten him with all of the others ordering from the states.

With no Dead Marshes on Amazon, I think I will go with FFG direct and wait the 3 weeks to get my hands on the cards. The local supplier seems to have dropped the ball again recently and is now a month behind American release.

Yay for living in a colonial back water!

You live in SA right? I have an arrangement with my supplier who is also my friend, as soon as the stock arrives he puts one aside for me. So although I have to wait, I'm going to honour our agreement. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but thanks for the link, I'll check it out.

So, do we know the release date for Dead Marshes?

Most Distributors in the US should have it on Monday, and then shipping time could put it in stores as early as Tuesday. I know the store I work at will have it by Tuesday by the earliest next week.

I am in Sydney, and I get mine from international, even with postage it is way cheaper than buying in a local store. For individual packs I get it form http://www.bookdepository.com/... [http://www.bookdepository.com/...] they do not charge for international shipping, so buying a single pack from them works out as about 15 bucks Australian. Most local stores sell them for 20+.. so it is cheaper and comes out way quicker, as they are very fast on mailing.

For large orders of LCG stuff I use a ebay store LotusVault... it is more expensive for a individual pack then teh book depository, but if you are getting bulk then it is cheap as... for example a complete 6 pack cycle from CoC costs $120 min from my local stores but costs about 80 bucks from here... that is a huge saving. He gets stuff pretty quickly on new release.. if you go there mention "EyeByeThings" so he knows I sent ya :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
