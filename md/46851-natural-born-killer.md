There is this guy with handsome looks (even though men tend to suggest he looks like a female) who just loves killing. His name is Green Leaf but he sees red. No wonder he belongs to the red sphere of influence. He barely ever goes questing yet his thirst for blood makes his commrads progress through locations and scenarios. He just loves to kill and when there are no enemies around he gets angry and idle as if his companions should begin to worry.

Well, I really like to use this character, and combine with Blade of Gondolin. It makes a big difference to get two or three progress markers - as many locations require just three or more. I used to have him with Gimli and Glorfindel with a red-major deck. Now I put him with Beravor and Glorfindel to the mostly green pasture with just a touch of red dropping from this light-footed guy's blades and arrows.

What is other peoples' experience and/or strategy, do you keep Legolas in your deck? To me, he is very useful.

ps: I kinda distaste the movie from which I borrowed the tile, I like the title though

He is extremely useful and I like him a great deal. The one issue I have with using him right now, is that it means that you will exclude one of the more useful spheres out of your deck. Simply put, most decks work better, at the moment, without tactics heroes. Leadership resource acceleration/all around goodness, spirit threat lowering/discard recursion and lore card drawing/healing. One of those key ingredients will be missing from your deck and awesome as Legolas is, he can't make up for any of it. The first pack is going to have a way to splash leadership into decks without a leadership hero and I'm hoping this is going to make tactics heroes more playable without losing any of the other sphere's impact. Tactics is definitely one sphere that needs better support to make their heroes a bit more playable.

You are totally right, I believe. When playing solo, Tactics do no good. But I almost never play solo with the deck - mostly I cooperate with a purple blue deck of Theodred, Aragorn, Dunhere.
