# [Question on Forest Snare card](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60108-question-on-forest-snare-card/)

Just a simple question:  After I kill a monster that I've used the Forest Snare on, what happens to the attachment?  Is the Forest Snare "destroyed" with the enemy?  Or does it go back into my play area?  This seems like more of an "event" card to me, but it says "attachment" and I have not found any other one use attachments.

Sorry if this is an ignorant question, still very new to this LCG but enjoying it!

Thanks!

 It will go into your discard. I'll find the page number in the rulebook for you.

 

Edit: Found it. Page 9, Main Rulebook

Attachment Cards: "If the card to which an attachment is attached leaves play, the attachment card is discarded."

 

2nd Edit: Just to comment on the "one-use attachment" phrase; It's the same as if you play an attachment on your Ally and it is defeated by a monster. The attachment isn't one use (that is, it lasts from turn to turn), but if your Ally is lost, he takes it with him. Forest snare for that matter will last turn to turn, which I've found useful to let it sit on creatures for a while if necessary.

I really appreciate that - I looked but didn't find it.  I figured it would be discarded, but the "attachment" threw me.

When you mentioned a "one-use attachment", I immediately thought of Ancient Mathom as another example.

~But really, what would it do in your play area? just hang out?
