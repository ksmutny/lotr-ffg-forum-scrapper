After a brief hiatus to improve how the images are hosted, Ian's fantastic First Age custom expansion is once again available on Hall of Beorn Card Search:

http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?CardSet=First+Age&CardType=Hero [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?CardSet=First+Age&CardType=Hero]

Â 

To include First Age cards in your search you will need to include +custom in your query as only official cards are returned in card searches by default. For example: "Mablung" will only return the Third Age Tactics hero, "Mablung +custom" will also return the First Age elf of the same name. Alternatively, you can specifically pick "First Age" in the card set drop down menu.

I encourage anyone who has not yet experienced this awesome adventure to go and check it out!
