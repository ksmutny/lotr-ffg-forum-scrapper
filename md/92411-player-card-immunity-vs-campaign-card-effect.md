And spoiler alert for Black Riders content -- we're probably at the point now that we can stop advertising spoilers for this, but better safe than sorry.

 

Flight to the Ford's campaign card give you a way of canceling an enemy attack.  The Witch King is player card immune -- I am wondering whether you can use the campaign card's effect to cancel his attack.  I am thinking yes, no problem.  I don't think campaign cards count as player cards, and the Black Rider rules insert seems to support this simply by listing them separately on the first page of the insert, where the box contents are listed.  Boons like Mr. Underhill appear to be counted in the Player Card count.  

 

 

What do you think?

I'd say yes. Which likely means that Calaeb will tell you it is in fact not possible.

 

 

I have another question:

 

Can I target shadow cards dealt to the Witch King? Like, discarding a Dunedain Watcher to prevent its effect? I think yes I can, but as I didn't want to cheat evil, I resolved the effect nonetheless. Now Sam has an impressive scar over his face...

Yeah you can.  Here's a recent thread with an old quote of an official response.... http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/91531-smaug-and-rider-of-the-mark/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/91531-smaug-and-rider-of-the-mark/]

 

 

Essentially saying that yes, you can target shadow cards dealt to 'immune' enemies.
