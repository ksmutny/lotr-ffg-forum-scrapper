# [Storage for all those sleeved cards?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46514-storage-for-all-those-sleeved-cards/)

Hello again!

I was wondering what people use to neatly store their cards within the LOTR LCG box. The insert provided by FFG is pretty useless, and I'm considering getting deck boxes to store my personal deck, the encounter deck, and the other player and quest cards. 3 deck boxes per box, if they fit, seems to be what I'm aiming at. Any brand recommendations?

Thanks!

I have been using elastics and the core set box for now but will be picking up a regular white cardboard card  storage box to hold them in once more come out. You can get them at any gaming or card shop.

I'm afraid of using any type of rubber band to hold cards together because of the fear that it might cause dents in either the sleeves or the cards themselves. The plain cardboard storage box is a good idea. I will look into those, thank you.

elastics won't hurt sleeved cards unless you make them too tight. The one's that actually work best are girl's hair elastics, I steal my fiance's and step daughters all the time when I see one dropped somewhere.

I know with the sleeves I used the number on the back that tells you what sleeve FFG suggests.  So it was blue with the number 5 which the store employees knew what I was talking about and I got what I needed.

As for boxes I used different color Ultra-Pro deck boxes to match the spheres of influence except I got an extra red one for the Event Deck.  It all worked nicely.

It is unfortunate the insert's middle canyon is slanted at one side (or at least mine is). If it were straight, I would've kept it as is and stored everything in the middle. As it is slanted, I flipped the insert over and store the cards in one of the side compartments, just wide enough to hold all the cards (in penny sleeves).

I use Ultra-Pro brand deck boxes to store my cards, as well as small, transparent acrylic Ultra-Pro cases for each of the different types of tokens.  I have the boxes laying on their backs arranged around the inside perimeter of the box (making a square shape with a "void" in the middle), and it comfortably fits my seven deck boxes (one for each sphere, two for encounter cards, and one for neutral and quest cards), and three small acrylic cases.  Two of the acrylic cases are stacked on top of each other and arranged like another one of the deck boxes, with the third case in the "void" in the middle.  I have four threat dials and my first player token sitting on top of that case in the middle.  The rule book and some turn flow charts I got from Boardgamegeek rest on top of it all.

At the moment, I keep my custom decks in the various "sphere" boxes along with the various Sphere-specific cards I have left over, but I will soon be using two more deck boxes designated purely to store those (I'm waiting for them to be delivered).  I have a LOT of room left over in my deck boxes, so I'll be able to accomodate quite a few expansions before needing to buy extra boxes.  If I turn the deck boxes on their sides, they do not stick up out of the box at all, and the lid still makes a perfect (tight), seal; this would allow me to store maybe two or three times as many deck boxes as I can with them on their backs, so I'll probably have to do that sometime down the road.  Now if only I could overcome my irrational paranoia of my cards being put under unecessary stress or somehow damaged by the deck boxes being placed on their sides, I would be perfect happy with how I have things neatly and snugly organized.

I use the ultra pro deck boxes as well. They fit in the middle part of the insert too so it works great!

Wow, thanks for all the suggestions, people. I'm gonna check out the Ultra-Pro products and see what I can get. Luckily I kept the three plastic bags that game with the game and use them to store the tokens... but a nice box would look prettier and be more easily accessible... Hmm! lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

While that is a crafty solution for your tokens, I feel like those dividers won't be enough for me. How do you keep the cards from sliding up and down the center of the board? I'm looking for something more snug.

The cards don't move with my solution: I even store the core set box in vertical. The reason is that I have filled the empty space with the tockens' tuckbox you can see in the pictures.

Hahah, that little box for your tokens is just too cool.  Gotta admit, I thought about storing my cards very similarly, so kudos to your setup, looks pretty snazzy.  I'll have to take some pictures of my box once I charge my camera.

For card storage I use baseball card storage boxes like these:

http://www.bcwsupplies.com/products/corrugated-storage-boxes/ [http://www.bcwsupplies.com/products/corrugated-storage-boxes/]

 

For storing built decks, I use Ultra Pro deck boxes and Rook *metal* deck boxes like those found here:

As for tracking progress and hero sphere tokens I use FFG tokens found here:

http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/showproducts.cfm?FullCat=206&step=2 [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/showproducts.cfm?FullCat=206&step=2]

 

I use the Red, Blue, Green, Silver and Gold tokens because they are flat and stackable.  I also use some purple wooden cubes I found elsewhere.

I really like this setup. This is what I was looking for. What brand are those thin(ner) acrylic boxes for your tokens? If you can, please provide a link :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Thanks to everyone else for their input as well. Might use cardboard storage as more packs are released.

They're also Ultra Pro brand, and specifically it seems that they're called "2-piece boxes."  They're just two pieces of acrylic plastic that fit snugly together, and there's no hinge.  There are a ton of different sizes, I use three of the 25 count ones for my tokens (two Core sets worth of tokens in each).  The following is a link to the exact product I purchased from my local game store, and I think they cost me maybe $0.50 each...

Just ordered some from that site. Thanks again! I'll pack everything into one of the core boxes, and keep the other one to store future adventure packs.
