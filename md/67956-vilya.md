Just a minor thread here. I really like how Elrond or Vilya turned out, with a minor exception. I see it was easier to do this way but thematically it seems off the Ring can only be attached to Elrond, given the history of the previous bearer Gil-Galad. I think a Noldor or Istari hero would do well; but on the other hand I understand Elrond's power, and it could have been hard to word it otherwise, not least due to the lack of space for the card text.

I think making the ring only work with Elrond was a good call based on mechanics.  The ring is a powerhouse, and if you want to use it you need to roll with the most 'expensive' hero in the game.  Your high starting threat makes it more difficult to use the ring's power.  Can you imagine what it would be like if you could put the ring on the new Glorfindel?

I also think is ok for now. But in the future  if we will get Gil-Galad as a hero will be thematically quite weird he cannot use the ring.

 Just make his text say that Vilya can be played on him. It's a messy way to do it, but it's right in line with the rest of this game.

## 5 [Mattr0polis on July 24, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67956-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=662851)

 Or they make a new version of Vilya for when Gil-Galad comes out that works more thematically with him.

It's fine.

 Yeah, I agree about the mechanics. I was thinking it could be a Noldor hero but not that every Noldor hero would have the same power. I totally see though how hard it would be to word all of that. That is why this thread is sort of pointless, I just felt like saying it. We have Horn of Gondor being carried by any hero, (thematically) in contrast to this.

 Gil-Galad died at the end of the Second Age…

i used to think we wouldnt see 2nd age characters but with the sage additions i think we shall see them as one of them

a numenor pack would be awesome

Who is/was Gil-Galad?

 

 

…Rich? :x

"Gil-galad was an Elven-king.
Of him the harpers sadly sing:
The last whose realm was fair and free,
Between the Mountains and the Sea.

His sword was long, his lance was keen,
His shining helm afar was seen,
The countless stars of heaven’s field,
Were mirrored in his silver shield.

But long ago he rode away,
And where he dwelth none can say,
For into darkness fell his star,
In Mordor where the shadows are."

The best answer on the question who is Gil-Galad.

Check out this melody on this poem. Very nicely done.

**** beaten to it……..as  the poem says gil galad was an elven king and in the 2nd age, along with elendil, was responsible for the march on sauron and the siege of barad dur. like elendil he perished during a duel with sauron himself, and so was the last high king of the noldor

rich

 Don't hold your breath on Silmarilian characters- I don't think Fantasy Flight has the licence yet.

Though they may get it if the game continues to be popular I suppose.

ha. i dont think anyone has that particular license….i believe last time i heard it was in a vault guarded by a fierce dragon

 We'll see what the Tolkien estate says when Peter Jacksons asks about making it after the Hobbit.

thats different….ffg doesnt bring in millions of dollars (they would be doing **** well if they did)

jackson's trilogy is the biggest earner by far (not counting the books themselves) and money has a habit of  changing people's mind

## 17 [Rapier1 on July 27, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67956-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=664508)

 Once they've licensed it out the first time though it becomes much less sacrosanct.

As far as I know they've never let the licence be used for anything up until now. 

 

FF could always get the merchandise licence from the film rights for example.

Plus, Jackson produced a quality work that surely encouraged Tokien Estate to lend him the rights on Bilbo… Now if those 2 films are as good as they are promissing, I guess he could ask for the right to make a Silmarillion-based movie anytime after that… Though it would be more difficult to find a subject fitted for a movie in it (since most people don't know - and don't care) about Tolkien's world outside of the LotR and the Hobbit…

With all respect, I think you are mistaken here. There is an incredible potential in Tolkien's work, and in fantasy. Just look how "easy" it was to create massive audience with the garbage of the likes of Eragon or GoT. I am not to make the lovers angry, I just want to show the potential of such work. And Tolkien is already so popular that there will be huge audience once anything Tolkien-based is announced. And the fact that it is from a different time will only create a new one. I myself am very skeptical that Silmarillon-based film will ever happen (due to movie rights mostly) but I can imagine the outrage among the fans if it shall, and the crazed masses pouring into cinema; it would be full of great battles, beautiful sceneries, epic stories, hot actors and actresses, it doesn't get more attractive than that in current culture.

The adaption can still pose a certain problem but there are "major" stories to pick upon, the Trees and the Silmarills, the Exodus of Noldor, Beren and Lúthien, Children of Húrin, Fall of Gondolin, War of Wrath, etc.

mmmm, im not sure what to think about a silmarillion film, mind you i still dont like the idea of a hobbit film (but thats a whole other thread)….though for different reasons. i think that there is more complex lore for the producers to crap on and turn into a hollywood story, and if i thought the trilogy pulled some bad decisions then the silmarillion would be much worse as if they pulled the storys from the books straight to film, or even followed them closely, then most film viewers would be baffled. hell how many of us had to read the silmarillion 2/3 times until we properly got it?

it still would have all the wonderful scenes as lleimmoen said, but i think the task would be great to adapt it to a film, far more than the trilogy or the hobbit
