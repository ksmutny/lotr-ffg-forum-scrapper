Are on the way...

I like Hirgon.  I like him a lot.

Yay.

Hirgon looks fun, and he has nice traits! 

I am surprised the deck example in the article did not include any copies of Galadhon Archer or Marksman of Lorien. Those seem like they would fit perfectly with him.

Agreed.  Galadhon Archer, Marksman of Lorien, and potentially Knight of Minas Tirith all have some fun synergy with Hirgon.  He seems like a good fit with Tactics Imrahil, who is already running high on tactics allies.  Red Arrow slots into that deck perfectly.

## 5 [John Constantine on May 17, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2790738)

True synergy would be with the Greenwood Archer, too bad that one is out of sphere.

I like the look of the beneath the sands scenario - although their example deck is not one that thematically works overly well, quite hard to imagine going through a labyrinth of tunnels with Ent and eagle allies, but hey maybe the tunnels are huge.

## 7 [JanB on May 17, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2790971)

Hirgon fits perfectly with Eagles. He reduces the costs of the expensive ones like Landroval and Gwaihir.

"Keep Watch" side quest looks like a must in Beorn decks

Maybe I missed it, but what card has the cover art for the article? It looks like Theoden.

Rally the West.

I can't remember if the play restriction keeps it from working since it is an event, but - can Elrond + Vilya play The Free Peoples without meeting the 9 trait criteria?

## 12 [Bullroarer Took on May 25, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2806017)

Off the cuff I think not.

## 13 [PocketWraith on May 25, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2806027)

Yeah, I'd say no. It works for using Vilya on attachments because they're put into play rather than played, but events are still played by Vilya, so the restriction would apply.

## 14 [Slothgodfather on May 25, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2806134)

Figured as much, but wanted to double check. thanks!

## 15 [Bullroarer Took on May 25, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2806240)

Just picked it up.  It's DL5, played with Desert  Creatures and Harad Territory from the deluxe.  Sleeveing soon!

## 16 [Bullroarer Took on May 25, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2806512)

Lost my first game.  I think I had an unlucky series of encounter cards, but won't know for sure until a few more games.  I also know that the deck I'm using is weak against this type of quest.

## 17 [Bullroarer Took on May 26, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2806769)

I'm going to keep my comments here instead of the new thread.  Spoilers Ahead!!!

 

After reflection I realized that I DID get pretty unlucky in the game.  The "boss" spider doesn't drop down from here web until you reach stage 3 UNLESS you draw a certain 1 of location... which I drew on the first turn of the game.  After the location is explored she goes back to her web, but as per usual nowadays, as you advance to the next stage you shuffle the discard pile back into the deck.  I drew that location again shortly.

But there are also effects in the game that simply don't scale with the number of players, so I think that this one is particularly hard on solo players compared to three player for example.  As spoiled by FFG in the announcement article yu are always strugling to stay "On Track", but when you are on track the quest notches up the difficulty.  For example if yu are On Track you cannot cancel When Revealed effects at a certain stage.  Being On Track and Off Track essentially requires you to reveal an extra card per turn, but in different ways, and this does not scale.  Which is why I think this one favors multi-player.

Awesome player cards in this box btw.

What'd you mean by "works for using Vilya on attachments?" Just curious what restrictions that gets around.

Ent Draught can only be played if you control an Ent character, but since attachments are *put into play* by Vilya rather than being actually played you can dodge that restriction. That's the only one I can think of (Elrond enables you to play Lembas anyway), but there could theoretically be more in the future.

Won my second attempt.  Did a bit of turtling on 1A and was lucky to be able to keep recurring an easy location with Off Track.  I also had a couple of side quests come up which further enabled the strategy.  Both decks treated me pretty well.  Brood Mother is a tough kill.

## 21 [Bullroarer Took on May 27, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249906-reinforcements/?do=findComment&comment=2809203)

This might be the first quest where I've really wanted to put side quests into my stack. Before now I've mostly looked at them as a distraction, but for this quest the are pretty useful.
