I am sorry if this is a stupid question, but what is the standard card size? Is it the same size as magic cards?

It´s not a stupid question - i purchased the wrong card sleeves today.

Standardsize is magic size. So LOTR card sleeves size = Magic = Game of thrones = Cuthulu.

I've just been looking myself, since the cards will definitely need protection.

The cards in the following link should be the right ones - you get 50 for $2.99 and they are sized 2 1/2" x 3 1/2" (63.5 x 88 MM), not bad at all -

2 1/2" x 3 1/2" (63.5 x 88 MM) Card Game Sleeves [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=86&esem=2&esum=152] (solid coloured)

I'll probably get the White Card Game Sleeves [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS31] myself.

There will be art sleeves made for the LOTR CG too, but are currently unreleased. They have packs with the following images - Nazgul [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS44], Golden Wood Singer [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS45], Gandalf [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS46], Gimli [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS47], The One Ring [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS48] and Eye of Sauron [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/productdetails.cfm?sku=FFS49]. Those are a bit dearer at $4.99 for a pack of 50. I'll probably get a few of these packs too at some point.

Thanks for the links. I think I want the clear sleeves myself, because I love the art on back. Even though my Gandalf cards are marked (each one has a horizontal line going through both front and back) I promise to try to play fairly if I use the clear sleeves.
