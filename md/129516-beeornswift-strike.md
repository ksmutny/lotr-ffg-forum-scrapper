Beorn can't trigger swift strike, correct? He would be interacting (triggering) a player card effect.

Actually I'm pretty sure he can. Beorn can interact with player cards, they're not immune to him, they just can't interact back. Swift Strike doesn't seem to me like it targets the character declared as a defender, so there's no reason why Beorn would have a problem with it.

I think Pocket Wraith is correct. This card deals with the shadow card dealt to an enemy who attacks Beorn, and has nothing to do with Beorn himself

Sauron, maybe you're thinking of Hasty Stroke?  (cancel shadow effect)

 

Swift Strike is: put 2 damage on an attacking enemy.  You can use this if Beorn is defending, as he does not actually interact with the card.  It triggers off of his declaration as a defender but Beorn is not targeted in any way.

OOPS! don't know what I was thinking! swift strike is just a card that I never use so I kinda forgot about it! but I think what I said might still apply if you put it into the correct context ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

hay, he who you refer to is me.  Morgoth's been in the abis for a LONG time.  I am not the servant but he himself

glaurung, Sauron Khamul… we have already some company here

except for one problem.  Glaurung, you were killed by turin turambar years ago and khamul, he is a lowly nazgul, a mere servant of Sauron ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Well, we all know what happened to Sauron.

 

After helping Eowyn slay the Witch-King at Pelennor Fields, Berethor, Idrial, and Elegost scaled Baradur-dur and stuck their pointy swords right into that mean ol' eye [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQ-eNWwFflE].

he lasted much longer than any of the others and got the closest to controlling Arda.  and Your history, though epic, is not accurate.  Sauron the Great was actually slain, by none other than "the wind"

"Enormous it (Sauron, who had just mustered enough power to take the form he had once known) reared above the world, and stretched out towards them a vast threatening hand, terrible, but impotent: for even as it leaned over them, a great wind took it, and it was all blown away, and passed; and then a hush fell" - JRR Tolkien in The Return of the King
