I love the art.  It ends there. 

Please help me love this card. To me it's only slightly better than The End Comes. 

Can/has anybody put a deck together using this contract than can beat difficult quests?

Seastan called this deck consistently strong:

https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/16230/consistentwisdom-1.0 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/16230/consistentwisdom-1.0]

In the comments he writes that he "tested it against Escape from Umbar, which it crushed. I could tell that it would be capable of beating harder quests as well."

Vilya decks tend to be full of 1x anyway, so the main thing is finding Vilya.  This deck has Vilya, Word of Command, and Heed the Dream (with LeDenethor being one of the three heroes).

As an aside, I think there's a LOT of room between "can beat difficult quests" and The End Comes.  A Council of Wise deck that *can't* beat the most difficult quests but can beat most quests could still be a ton of fun, and with no duplicates would experience a lot of variety in play.  Meanwhile, The End Comes is one of the most coasterish coasters in all of coasterdom.  I don't think a contract has to create a power deck to be worth playing.

Its a fun contract for sure, but its not very powerful. I really enjoyed never knowing how it would play or what I would draw. It was always different.

Problem is you can't count on anything from your deck. Its totally inconsistent. If I wanna powerhouse a quest, I am not playing this contract.

Im playin 3 hunters.

But it is not comparable to The End Comes. That card is so bad I wouldn't even include it in a Council deck. Even with the event benefit, that card is just bad. The contract however is not bad, just not that strong.

Great with Elrond Vilya or in secrecy decks with the events that you can recur for maximum triggering

I have a Silvan deck with this contract that is quite powerful. The main thing you look for is Nenya, but with so many different Silvan allies and events, you can draw through your deck quite quickly. Silver Harp and Mirror of Galadriel combo can find other important cards like O Lorien sooner, but even without those attachments, the deck is pretty consistent. I have beaten Escape from Umbar, Drowned Ruins, and Foundations of Stone with the deck this past weekend, and it did well in 2 of the three scenarios. The Drowned Ruins just punishes Silvans, but that wasn't the deck's fault.

Difficulty-wise, Escape from Umbar is roughly right next to Passage Through Mirkwood. Sorry, have to say that.

This seems a little unfair. Sure Escape from Umbar might not be a difficult quest, but with the whole "remove tokens from the quest" mechanic and the swarm of enemies is most definitely harder the the super easy tutorial Passage Through Mirkwood.

To be honest though Flrbb has a point. Escape from Umbar is certainly harder than PtM but its not a hard quest. Thats why its so popular as a testing quest.

A deck that can beat Escape from Umbar isn't necessarily a powerful deck.

If it takes down Crossing of Poros or Dread Realm its probably a strong deck.

Per the user ratings at the quest companion, it's right next to Journey Along the Anduin.  It's rated 5.4, Journey is 5.3, and Passage is 2.2.  There's really no comparison between starting with the Forest Spider/Old Forest Road combination (regardless of the number of players) and X unique locations, each player starting with an engaged enemy, and a quest you lose if you don't have progress on the first stage to remove, even on round one.  Indeed the Umbar Sentries shows a good deal of enemy creep -- 1/2/1/3 is a bit heftier than first cycle surgers but not especially scary -- unless you can't afford to remove progress from the main quest, boosting their attack to 4.  Ufthak (after the first turn) and Ungoliant's Spawn are the *only* enemies with attack over 3 in Passage.  Oh and the Sentries have archery, because why not pile on the damage?

It's a fair point that beating Umbar isn't a demonstration that a deck is powerful, unlike some other quests where beating it is impressive by itself (e.g. Black Serpent).  But Seastan didn't make that claim -- he said he tested against Escape, it *crushed* that quest, *and* he could tell that it could beat more difficult quests also.  I haven't tried the deck myself, but if Seastan calls a deck "consistently strong" I'm inclined to take that at face value.

After all, it *is* a Vilya deck, and we all know what that can do.  All the unique cards being 1x is a common feature in Vilya decks under normal conditions, because that way they never whiff.  The main handicap compared to a normal Vilya deck is being unable to include 3 copies of your key card, but with the hero choices allowing Heed the Dream and Word of Command to be played turn one -- and to play Vilya also, due to the contract -- that's somewhat mitigated.

You know what? I'm not even a fan of that much. First single sided contract of the bunch, not loving that fact either.

What if you "you may take one additional mulligan to start the game"

I have to admit that my upper comment was a bit harsh. So, let me re-phrase: in behalf of all the nightmare quests, EfU is quite close to PtM. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

A little late to this thread, but as my deck was brought up I thought I'd comment.

Escape from Umbar was used to test the deck, but the mere fact that I won is not what I used to judge the strength of the deck. Rather, the gameplay experience is what I used, i.e. how quickly I found the key cards, how quickly I filled up my table, etc. The quest itself was just to provide some structure. I could do the same thing with no quest at all in front of me (goldfishing), but I happen to like that quest a lot.

And based on this experience (not the victory), I could tell it was a top tier deck, capable of beating much harder quests. I've played the game enough by now to be able to get an idea of deck's capabilities after a little bit of goldfishing. I'm sure many of you have as well.

But just in case you don't care about all that, and only care about wins, I took the deck up against Nightmare Carn Dum, and beat it on the first attempt in 7 rounds, with a final threat of just 30. In other words, crushed it. It's a top tier deck. But that should never have been in doubt. In case you've forgotten how good Vilya is, this was my board state at the beginning of the second quest phase.

And this was the final turn:

Thank you for all your input. I'm going to try that deck out for myself. Seeing as I'm on attempt number 7 of Land of Sorrow I'll try it out on that.

Seastan I believe made a point that the deck is not good because its a Council of the wise deck.

Its good because its a Vilya deck. If you need a strong deck to beat LoS a Vilya deck with Elrond is a good idea since Elrond really helps with his healing. But if you want Elrond powerhouse to be consistent this probably isn't the deck for you, since Vilya is a 1 of, and so is the star gazer. 

## 17 [dalestephenson on August 25, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310174-council-of-the-wise-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3978759)

While Vilya is 1x, there are three cards that can get Vilya in play on turn one -- Vilya itself, Word of Command, and Heed the Dream.  I think Stargazer is less important in a Gandalf/Vilya deck, but there are four cards that manipulate the top card in it.

Looking at the deck on ringsdb, I see some detail about the Carn Dum victory not shared here -- he didn't get one of the three Vilya-getting cards in his initial hand or mulligan, but drew into it with Daeron's Runes and Drinking Song.

It's true that it's good because it's a Vilya deck, and also true that it's not likely at all to be the optimal Vilya deck.  But I doubt it's that inconsistent -- using card draw for all the cheap/free events will shrink the effective size of the deck significantly.

## 18 [Seastan on August 25, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310174-council-of-the-wise-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3978816)

Yes, in that specific Carn Dum win, it was actually the card draw from the contract that enabled me get the turn 1 Vilya, which was kind of neat.

But this isn't a defense of CotW as a card, just a defense of this specific deck still being good, despite the CotW limitation. If you dropped CotW and built a deck with 3x Vilya and 3x of the fetching cards, it would be even more consistent, and a stronger deck overall. But the OP was just asking for a CotW deck that can beat difficult quests, so I think it qualifies.

## 19 [asgardianphil on August 26, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310174-council-of-the-wise-what-am-i-missing/?do=findComment&comment=3979484)

I played a game using Seanstan's deck.

(Attempt 7 attempt 1 with this deck.)

I didn't draw vilya or searching cards. Mulligan: still no vilya or searching cards. I did draw some card draw cards and events. I used all the card draw effects and Gandalf's staff to draw cards as often as I could. When playing an event I reduced threat twice and drew cards about 3 other times. Still no vilya or card searchers. (Or threat reducers other than double back, which I successfully completed) 

 

I lost the quest after about 4 or 5 turns. I couldn't reduce threat fast enough (4 threat increase each turn) and couldn't draw into vilya or fetching cards. 

I didn't feel I could travel to a camp as I didn't have enough allies out to defend and quest successfully. 

I had a new appreciation for the contract and deck though and I'll keep trying as luck of the starting draw was bad. 

I just wish the contract was unique cards are limited to one per deck. As I wish burglars turn only prevents item and artifact attachments rather than all attachments. I feel these contracts have been designed by new staff and not the original designers. They are blunt rather than nuanced.

I wonder if switching Denethor for Thurundir might work as he can pull Gather Information in set up. And that would guarantee pulling Vilya or another card if you happen to grab Vilya some other way    And then remove the leadership cards or put in song of kings etc

That can work, though completing Gather Info on turn 1 is not always possible, and may be less likely than getting a search card in your opening hand. It also requires committing everyone to the quest, leaving you vulnerable in the first combat phase. Lastly, this strategy results in your first Vilya use actually being on turn 2, rather than turn 1.

I'm shocked, surprised and elated all at once.

 

I started playing at 6pm and it's now 10.55 pm. But that's mainly because I typed as I played.

So Land of Sorrow took me 8 attempts and 2 of those attempts were with Council of the Wise.

Thanks to Seanstan for his amazing deck. 

I only changed 1 card. Thurindir for leadership Denethor.

I'm so glad I whinged about this card. 🤣

 

It is a lot of hard work. I could have made a better deck without the contract and put in more threat reduction.  The only benefit is for those who want to explore different types of deck building or make the game harder still. I still wouldn't think of Council of the wise as a quest beating tool as it would say Elrond and Vilya. 

I feel it would have been better if only unique cards were limited to 1 copy and non unique to 2 even. Or maybe just don't limit events. The choosing only 1 option per round is annoying too. There were a few times I was forced to draw a card but didn't really need to I'd rather have the threat reduction. Having free choice is still limited by the number of events you can actually play. 

 

So I'm my game what benefits did I get out of Council Of The Wise over the 10 turns i played? 

Threat reduction:  -6

Resources: 3 

Cards drawn: 2

 

No benefit until turn 3. 

Turn 3: 1 resouce, -1 threat 

Turn 4: 1 resource, -1 threat, +1 card

Turn 5: -1 threat.

Turn 6: 1 resource, -1 threat, +1 card

Turn 7: nothing

Turn 8: -1 threat

Turn 9: nothing 

Turn 10: -1 threat. 

Thoughts.?

Actually yes I do have a thought.

You mention some alternatives to CoTW, and while I can say it certainly isn't a very strong contract, I actually like it the way it is. The 1 copy of each card just makes every game so different in a really fun way. 

I will say that your comment about Burglars Turn is exactly what I felt about that contract. It would have been really sweet if your deck only couldn't include item and artifact attachments, but was open for mounts, skills, etc. The no attachments rule makes it really tough to play. Too many decks rely on at least 1 or 2 attachments.

Also nice playthrough. Elrond + Vilya is crazy, just plain crazy.

Throw in a wizard pipe and it's down right crazy. 🤣

I would've preferred if you could even just have 1 card allowed as a 3x. Most deck archetypes are designed around getting at least one key card out quickly: Steward of Gondor, Vilya, To the Sea!, Heir of Valandil, King of Dale, O Lorien!, Eagles of the Misty Mountain, Treebeard, Light of Valinor, Resourceful, Spirit Imrahil, Legacy of Durin, Visionary Leadership, etc. By imposing a 1x limit you hamstring basically every trait and archetype, which the bonus from the contract does not come close to making up for.

Yeah it is definitely a big restriction that pulls down its power level. 

The thing is I believe Caleb mentioned on Card Talk that most people build trait-based decks and he wanted the contracts to try do something different. This contract definitely feels like it steers away from a certain trait and just opens up a different kind of deck entirely.

Yeah, that’s my favorite part about this card. By far it’s spurred me to build more decks than the other contracts, and all my council decks are pretty different from typical fare from what is posted on ringsdb. A good deal of criticism about this card boils down to “I wish this were a contract that lets me play my usual style, but stronger,” and I can see where the disappointment would come in, if that’s what you’re looking for in a contract (Burglar’s turn suffers the same fate).

Caleb's approach to design often seems to be:

1- For encounter cards, look at what players are doing in the current meta, then design some quests for the next cycle that defeats that strategy (penalty for large hand size, penalty for ally swarm, throw in a card here or there to defeat a voltron deck, etc)

2-For player cards, look at what kind of decks people are not playing, then create room for those decks (monosphere decks, decks that engage and then don't kill enemies, decks that aim to remove their own allies from play, etc.).  Keep in mind: there were reasons to do all of those things before card design made them more desirable, but people weren't doing them. (why keep enemies in play? Forest Snare prevents it from coming back. Once Dunedain hit the scene , you had a plethora of more reasons to keep them around. Why play monosphere? Resource management is more efficient. Some cards enhancing monosphere decks pushed this further).

 

Council of the Wise promotes a deck type that is pretty much absent from LotR LCG (1x decks).  If you can get past the idea that "consistency is defined as drawing the same card or set of cards in every game," this contract is more palatable. Consistency might instead be defined as "drawing cards that perform the same function/role in every game."  You can't easily build a deck around a single card interaction (Vilya), you have to spend energy compensating for the limitations of CotW in order to do that (for example: add deck searching items and have a less-than-ideal setup because you end up keeping Heed the Dream and paying 4 to get Vilya into hand instead of starting with it in your hand).  Instead, if you build your deck around generalities, like "readying" and "healing" and "willpower ally" and "attacking ally," you can build a pretty good deck that's not reliant on drawing a specific card.

 

I've been using the benefit of the deck (reward for playing events) as a resource and draw engine, filling up the deck with around 25 0- and 1-cost events, and usually going tri-sphere to allow access to more 0- and 1-cost events.  I think what I'll experiment with next is allowing myself to use more expensive events, but do something crazy like monosphere, to make it easier to play the higher cost ones I do get, without hamstringing my ability to play other important cards in my hand like allies.  

 

Anyway, I really like the level of experimentation this contract has driven me into.

Yeah its a lot of fun. I have made 2 decks with this contract and I really enjoyed being able to include events that always got squeezed out of regular decks. Now they are so playable.

Rumour from the earth is a great example. In regular decks people would much rather include Henemarth and be done with it, but now the event is giving you an added bonus, and its repeatable. I have included many seldom used events like Dawn take you All and Fresh Tracks and had great fun using them. You just never know what your gonna draw.

My 1 deck had Gloin using well preserved with the One Ring, so that was easy for set-up. He was accompanied by Beorn and Smeagol, who combo nicely (smeagol turns into stinker, undefended Gloin, make $, Beorn swats him... Repeat).
