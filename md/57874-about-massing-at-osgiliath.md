 Hi im a beginner so im trying to get my card collection up to date. I am wondering if I should buy massing at osgiliath soon, because im worried that later on it wont be sold anymore. I know it is print on demand but I am not sure exactly what that means and how long it will actually keep being print on demand. 

 

thanks

 If you have the disposable income then get it now..if not don't. Also if you are prone to /ragequit and migranes this is not a recommended product.lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] Lastly if you don't have anyone to play it with I would recommend passing on the purchase. It can be done solo but not very often...as in seldom. It is a lvl 9 adventure and a lot of fun if you are into self mutilation and other (un)savory practices. demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

I'm not sure how long these print on demand things are around for.. but if you get into this game and do NOT get this quest you will be sore about it.. it is defiantly one of the best quest in the game period.. it is hard yes.. but that is why it is so awesome.

That perfectly summed up my thoughts. Nice story, ridiculously hard. We played four games during a weekend session, everyone was pissed that day. I guess it's not going to hit the table again.

Assuming all available cards, are there any good decks for this difficulty 9 horror?

If you have the cash it's worth it otherwise save your money and get it later. I doubt it will go anywhere.

As for the difficulty I can easily complete it solo with a mono Spirit deck and have done on a couple occasions. Multiplayer it is almost impossible. That's my experience anyway.

i hope FFG doesnt spend too much time on POD products in the future, i would rather they brought out the actual packs quicker, seeing as POD isnt even compatible with the rest of the game, and doesnt offer anything in deck expansion

it's totally worth it. yeah you're going to feel crushed, discouraged, beaten, trampled, bruised, pulverized,overwhelmed, depressed, bitter.....and then there's that little light, a little glimmer of hope.....and that gets extinguished too. these signs are normal and will pass.  after a half dozen tries, when you go from "i can't believe we never got one progress token" to actually crossing the anduin and making it home and taking the boots to the witchking............FREAKIN AMAZING!!!!!!!!!. sure i don't like this print on demand and paying more money just for a scenario. but just for this one. do it. you'll love the punishment. dol guldur? that's a warm-up. yeah. .

exactly.. this is what I do not get about people complaining about this game being hard.. the difficulty level is what makes this game so fun and interesting. When I first beat Massing solo during a deck testing session I was so happy. It was defiantly one of the best game experiences io have had in a long time. You get a great feeling of accomplishment and a real sense of achievement that your deck building and play strategies you have devised works.. This is how the game is meant to be.. I hope FFG do not follow anyone comments I read about making the game easier..

No it's not. There's a reason why not every scenario is difficulty 10. the game is meant to provide exactly the kind of challenge a given set of players enjoy. So what they really need to do is to continue publishing scenarios with a wide range of difficutly ratings.

Reserving the very high difficulty ratings for POD scenarios is exactly the right thing to do, because they're too frustrating for the majority of players, i.e. those who are more interested in playing it casually.

The minority of 'pro' players looking for a challenge also won't mind the higher price point.

... um.. yea that is exactly what i just said.

 I am trying to discern where Massing at Osgiliath is listed as difficulty 9. It was introduced to us at GenCon as difficulty 8.

i have absolutly no problem with the difficulty level, i just wish it offered more, and was of standard quality...with little money and faced with a new adventure pack or this., its obvious what im going to pick...and id class myself as a hardcore player, certainly not a casual one

i can not really tell the cards apart.. from the originals. Maybe as I got the first printing or something.. but they look exactly the same as the original ones I got form the APs.. I mean it is the same printers, same ink, same cards... so the quality difference is no different that from one Ap to another.

What I really want in these games is a deeper development of features.. like new keywords(witch are coming), maybe the addition of optional side quests during a quest... stuff like that. I think the base rules that have been invented here really allow from some creative encounter decks that have yet to be built.

I put all my cards in sleeves so I can't tell the difference in print quality at all then. To be fair to FFG though, the print quality isn't terrible at all.

There is a problem with current difficult level.

I love Massing in Osgiliath cose is really challenge!!!

But if you build deck to win this quest and is you can win quite often then all other quests start to be really boring for you. And this is really wrong!!! So i think is much better to have system where players can set up difficult level of any quest by some special mechanic or adding some encounter cards. But officially not some hand made ideas.
