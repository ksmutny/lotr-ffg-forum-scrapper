Well Dark Knowledge was useful along with Gloin back during Core Set... Until Frodo came along.

But yes, this does casts new light at that card.

yes, ive considered previous combos for it, however it just never seemed worth setting up.

however, get this in play and a 4+ attack enemy could turn into a very nice ally :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

That is a good idea! That negative will power is still a drag tho...I'd put it on Bilbo personally....my AP should have arrived today can't wait to break into when I'm done with work

yes bilbo is who i was thinking. i never use him for questing, mainly for defense with a brand and of course his amazing card draw....this is especially important as there is only 1 of those cards per core set

Yea I only have 1 core set too. I just can't justify buying all those cards only to gain extra copies of a select few. Although this also conflicts with my staunch stance of not using proxys

i used 1 core set for about 1 and half years until i saved up quite a lot of rewards points with my supplier...then i could justify it haha

Dark Knoledge is a under rated card. It gose on any hero that you plan to not quest with. Such as Dain or Denathor or Elenore or w/e. The advatange of it is that you do not need a lore resource match like with Brand.

One of its best uses is in A Journey To Rhasgobel. The bats have a 1 Attck, and if you peak at the shadow card you can tell if it is safe to block with wylandor or not.

I use it on Denethor, like booored says, any non-questing Hero works fine.

welp, played this quest twice with the hobbit deck and lost both times....need some revisions i guess haha.  The first time was kind of foolish on my part because i started with hand that had no other characters who could contribute willpower.  The first few encounter cards were enemies that just sat in the staging area until i could no longer quest succesfully. was over quckly

 

second game i had all the progress completed and more rescued villagers than dead, but i couldnt kill Ghulat!  Despite the large amounts of card draw in the deck, the two copies of Gandalf i was running were buried at the bottom of the deck.  My 1 attempt at using small target was also unsuccesful since i was forced to discard dark knowledge from my deck from a treachery

What a rich idea. Good combo! The biggest problem I see about this is just the whole idea of the Hobbit decks keeping low threat and hardly ever engaging an enemy, it might then be a bit hard to engage two at the time. Still, not that hard, surely. Henamarth or Risk Some Light also work, but it is indeed especially nice "new" use for Dark Knowledge (surely Bilbo doesn't mind the willpower "boost"). And the good thing is you can choose who attacks first, so if you somehow manage to find out both shadow cards, the chances one doesn't have a shadow effect is greater.

 

As for the Hobbit deck previewed on the site, we've been just talking about it today, and I'm sorry to side-track the thread, but I have to bring it up; it's really quite terrible; Timely Aid with over 20 starting threat, no Leadership hero and very few allies: some combo there!

yea making a hobbit deck is going to be tricky for the time being.  relying on the newer gandalf for attack power is a costly solution and even he cant take some of the bigger baddies all by himself.  once the black riders box is released i suspect it will be a much more viable option

i really expect to see things such as hail of stones for hobbits....

and speaking of black rider....and i dont mind derailing this thread as its my own, but who thinks the shard of narsil/anduril is going to be epic?

 

we shall surely get narsil in black rider and then anduril in the follwing pack (i wonder what it shall be called?)

and while im thinking, just imagine all of the goodies we shall get once we leave lothlorien haha....

Whilst I like the idea of Narsil/Andúril, it makes me a bit angry that Aragorn gets mentioned four times on other cards already whilst the luckiest of the rest (Elrond, Glorfindel) get a single mention. Of course he's the great hero of the time, but not the only one, right? I bet the artefacts in question will only go on him. But I wonder if Narsil is going to be called a weapon or not, guess not.

 

Now that I think about it, and I'm not really quick I must say, I guess it may be tricky to get them. First off, Sword that was Broken is Narsil, right? So we've already got that. So we could get Andúril still, but it wouldn't make sense to have both the broken and reforged version at the same time, and they cannot just call it the Sword that was Broken (again).

## 18 [richsabre on July 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85884-finally-a-good-use-for-dark-knowledge/?do=findComment&comment=809352)

haha. yes broken again would be rather terrible of aragorn to be so clumsy.

i actually completely forgot about already having narsil, just without the name.

 

so i think anduril will have 'attatch to a hero without sword that was broken' on it.

## 19 [GrandSpleen on July 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85884-finally-a-good-use-for-dark-knowledge/?do=findComment&comment=809395)

Or maybe Anduril will have text like "Cannot be in play while Sword That was Broken is in play."  

 

I agree that we shall (or should) see something like Hail of Stones for the Hobbitses.  Already it would be a great card for a Hobbit deck, except it's in the wrong sphere.  Incidentally, I do hope we never see a Tactics Hobbit hero.  That would surely mean an influx of Hobbit-themed tactics cards, which would just be bizarre.

I think that if you had Anduril, it should say something like, "Discard Sword that was Broken from play when you play this if it was in play", or something like that. Because I don't think that you should be able to have Narsil broken and Anduril in play at the same time. It wouldn't really make that much sense.

## 21 [Pharmboys2013 on July 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85884-finally-a-good-use-for-dark-knowledge/?do=findComment&comment=809434)

i'm not confident that if they make anduril it would require sword that was broken if only because the saga expansions are designed to be played without needing any previous products (or at least the hobbit boxes were made in this regard).  also in the unlikely event anduril would need the pre-requisite...it had better be an outstanding effect considering StwB is already a cost of 3 and there would be a large card quantity commitment in a deck for only 1 effect

## 22 [Gizlivadi on July 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85884-finally-a-good-use-for-dark-knowledge/?do=findComment&comment=809491)

I think he meant that IF sword that was broken is in play when you play anduril you discard it from play. A little sentence like that on the card would be nice. It would keep the current narsil card relevant, as I don't like it when they make unnecessary versions of already existing elements, or when they make unnecessary versions of things that we know we will be getting afterwards in their "true" form (I'm looking at you, Hobbit treasures). I hope it will not be necessary to have the shards of narsil or something like that beforehand to be able to play anduril.

Yes, epic. Epic fail, to be more accurate. As it has been mentioned, Aragorn did get plenty of toys already and I don't want this game turn into "Adventures of Aragorn and others". Or we will get even spirit and tactics version of him, because there is never too much Aragorn? :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

i think we should, regardless of whether he already has too many. anduril is a key element to the lord of the rings, and to not include it in the saga packs would be a huge dissapointment

perhaps it is more likely it will be a 'saga objective attatchment' much like glamdring in the hobbit packs...though i would rather have it.

there are way for the designers to handle this. it could not be as obviously powerful and epic as i first suggested. the best cards i think are the ones that make you think to be able to get use out of them

on a side note... and back to the original intention of this topic...i finally beat the quest with a hobbit deck albeit not easily.  Gandalf helped mightily and i also found myself using Lord Alcaron to attack and defend since his ability is not as critical once a lot of saved villager tokes have been amassed

I think you're looking at it wrong. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Narsil should complement a Sword that was broken if you manage to have both. Sure it's the same sword, but in it's reforging at Rivendell (by Noldor Smiths most likely) you have the ONE weapon that Sauron himself actually fears.

 

I have no problem with the cards not only being in play on the same hero, but actually having synergistic attributes if Aragorn is the wielder.

Aragorn is all right, and he has some goodies, sure.  But everybody knows that the Lord of the Rings is also called:  "GANDALF!.............and some other guys do some stuff".

I think Narsil and stuff would be something like treasure in Hobbit Saga expansion, not a usual player card.
