The card Poisoned Spear in The Mumakil checks the remaining hit points of a Mumak against the threat of a card discarded from the encounter deck, and captures the Mumak if the card's threat is greater than the remaining hit points. Is a Mumak with 0 remaining hit points captured by a Treachery discarded by this effect? That is, does the treachery have 0 threat or does it not have a threat value at all making the comparison impossible?

I would say that a treachery doesn't have a threat value because there are cards that have 0 threat. Also an event doesn't have willpower so isn't it the same sort of thing?

Threat value of treachery is 0, just as it would be if you had revealed a treachery card with "Needful to Know" or "Ravens of the Mountains"

Oh, is that how it works? I always ended games with such a situation in a SEGFAULT.Â ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
