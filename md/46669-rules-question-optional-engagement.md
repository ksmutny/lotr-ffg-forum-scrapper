# [Rules question:  Optional engagement](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46669-rules-question-optional-engagement/)

One thing I didn't see in the FAQ.  When as a player you choose to optionally engage an enemy (before engagement checks), does this still count as the enemy "engaging" you for effects on the enemy card?  (For instance, the +1 attack when the spider engages).

I may have missed it in the rules, but I'm just curious if that's an intended way to avoid nasty engagement effects, or if I'm making the game a little easier on myself than I should...

 

Thanks,

Yes, engaging is engaging no matter who initiates it, the player or the enemy.

Check towards the bottom of page 16 in the rules

"Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement check, through a card effect, or through a player's choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy and the player engaging one another. In all cases, the player is considered to have engaged the enemy and the enemy is considered to have engaged the player."
