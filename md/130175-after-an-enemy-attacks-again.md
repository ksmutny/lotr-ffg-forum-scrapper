# [&quot;After an enemy attacks&quot; (again...)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/130175-after-an-enemy-attacks-again/)

Hi folks,

 

some doubts about the wording on a couple of cards of the core set. Chieftain Ufthak reads "after this enemy attacks, then...". I noticed this thread [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/653353/chieftain-ufthak] on BGG, from which it seems that Ufthak attacks with a bonus since the first time his attack is resolved. But the FAQ seems to rule the opposite (pag. 9), where it's stated that the bonus is calculated after the step 4 of the attack resolution (hence, Ufthak attacks with an attack strength of 3 during his first attack). The latter seems to imply that the Dol-Guldur beastmaster receives only one shadow card during his first attack, and then he starts receiving 2 shadows / round only from his second attack on.

 

Anyone that could confirm this? Thanks a million for help

 

JULIA

The thread on BGG is 2011 old !

The faq is more recent and accurate.

The beastmaster has been errated to correct the timing.

Ok, thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] So, two shadow cards for the Beastmaster since round 1, and Ufthak gets the first token after the first attack resolves.
