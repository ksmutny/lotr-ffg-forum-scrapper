# [CardGameDB - New Deck Builder](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109446-cardgamedb-new-deck-builder/)

Card Game Database has released a major update to its deck editor... if you haven't been using it, then it might be a good time to go check it out!
 
For those that do not know FFG bought CGDB at last GenCon and they have been slowly working on creating a modern community site with spoilers and deck builders. So there are lots of changes that are finally starting to appear. This is one of them!
 
Anyway, head over to CGDB and say hi... This site uses the same forum software (no coincidence) So the deck exports can be pasted directly into threads here!

I enjoy the old LotR LCG deckbuilder too much to appriciate the new one.

I use Zorbec's Deck builder stand alone application. All other decks builders suck in comparison.

Works really well! Thanks for your work! It's nice to see the graphs updating instantly and actually working!

 

The only thing I would change is the Deck Type options. They don't seem to fit LOTR very well. For instance, I made a two hero secrecy deck and couldn't figure out which tag to use...

> I use Zorbec's Deck builder stand alone application. All other decks builders suck in comparison.

For me, the deck builder has to be online or be built to work with OCTGN, including pulling its data from the OCTGN database on my computer. Online allows me the flexibility to build decks from anywhere without needing to install an app and that keeps he decks all in one accessible place.

If I'm going to use an installed app, then I need access to OCTGN's database on my computer because I often "proxy" spoiled cards, and I also need the deck files to be usable by OCTGN in order for me to not need to manually recreate the deck in OCTGN in order to use it.

So no matter how good that deck builder is, if it doesn't fit those criteria, it isnt worth it. Not for me anyway.

Tried to create an account on CardGameDB yesterday to check out the deck builder tools, but still have not received the validation e-mail that was supposed to be sent, even though after a few hours I made another request that it be sent. The website indicates that those validation e-mails are supposed to be sent within 10 minutes, and I've checked my junk/spam folders, but still nothing.

 

So I currently am unable to post or respond to posts.

 

I'm assuming those validation e-mails are supposed to be auto-generated by the system, but maybe I'm wrong? Has anyone else had issues with this?

 

I have e-mailed the site administrator and am still awaiting a reply (I realize that it's the weekend, the admin may have a lot of things on his plate, etc., so I'm expecting it could take several days before I get a reply).

The emails should be auto-generated, but there may be issues with the system. As for the decks, you should the able to export and import, but no, he is using separate databases for old and new deckbuilders, so the don't auto transfer.

I can only print my deck on txt format as before, or there are other options?

PS: i also use zorbecs deckbuilder, i think it is the best by far, but i also use cardgamedb one when not at home

## 12 [GrandSpleen on July 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109446-cardgamedb-new-deck-builder/?do=findComment&comment=1143670)

I've tried a couple of deckbuilders and found that the CardGameDB one suits my needs best.  I had trouble getting used to Zorbec's and finding what I was looking for in the different windows.

 

A feature I would like, though, is a feature that lets you filter out cards that you have already used in another deck.  Say I want to make 4 player decks -- I can make deck 1, then when I go to make deck 2 I could access this feature to remove all deck 1 cards from my options while I'm building the second deck.  And so on.  I only have access to 1 set of player cards, and this would make it easier for me to build 4 decks without accidentally using the same cards in two decks.

I spoke to CBDB devs about deck tags and he is hapopy to add more LoTR specific tags....

 

So if you want any different tags... then post it here and I'll pass it on.

 

Secrecy

Quest

Support

Combat

Battle

Siege

Solo

1 of 2 Hands

2 of 2 Hands

1 of 3 Hands

...

..

..

4 of 4 Hands

 

 

Anything else you can think of.. besides things like "elves" or other trait specific ones.

I like that currently the cards you allready have selected are shown in 2 columns. (Previously only one column that you had to scroll).

 

I'd be very happy, if they would show in 4 columns - Heroes, Allies, Attachments, Events. (If neccessary scrolling to side).

 

What I'd also like is that I could select not only for what set to filter, but what set to exclude.

(At this moment, not so important, since I don't have only the latest adventure pack, but previously it was a hassle - either trying to ignore all the cards I don't have, or creating huge filter to include the selection of my cards)

 

Overall I like it very much, currently my number 1 choice.

Healing

Turtle

Ally Army

 

These are from the hall of beorn poll to determine what deck strategies most people preferred. The highest voted "tricksey" doesn't really seem like a deck type to me... but turtle and ally army definitely are. Perhaps Staging Area Control could be another one?

Turtleing lol lame there is no turtle in this game

There is plenty of turtling in this game.

what rubbish.

There is no turtelign in this game. Just because that term ius used in other games doesn't mean you can just use it in this one. It is ridicules. Every turn.. EVERY turn you need to quest... so you do not just "turtle".. witch is means staying put in your "base" and not moving out or attacking or w/e. The very nature of this game means that you have to venture out every turn.. so no there is no turteling.. stop being so sill!

Lol, are you drunk?

 

Regardless, there is turtling. Taking it slow, not rushing from stage to stage while you develop the army of allies, keeping threat in the staging somewhat equal to your questing willpower.

 

If there was no turtling, then Nightmare Carrock would not receive this 1 progress per turn thingy.

## 22 [booored on July 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109446-cardgamedb-new-deck-builder/?do=findComment&comment=1153361)

no.. that would be something else.

Turteling is a common term used in many games and ALWAYS means the same thing. Staying put and not expanding or attacking or doing anything outside your "shell". This is a term in so many games it is not open to debate.

 

In this game you ALWAYS have to quest, go out of the shell... so there is no turteling.

 

Saying it is is just ignorant at worst and at best someone trying to sound smart by using a gaming term they herd once but do not understand.

try just searching "cloak". It's definitely in there I just checked, perhaps you cannot find it because of the accent on the o in Lórien

Sadly, that deckbuilder (to be precise: the database behind it) is kind of broken since some month. At least they fixed the doublets in the database. Also side quests are somtimes marked as "hero", sometimes as different other entities, so you cannot add all of them to your deck. And characters like "ó" aren't found easily while seaching. Somehow a special case occurs with Cloak of Lorien; you have to check all boxes of spheres that it will appear.

Broken as hell, but imho still a good deck builder.

Besides, I did not know that it belongs to FFG. Its a pitty that they do not fix their very own tools!

Indeed when i searched with all spheres on, i found it. When i had only lore it did not appear. It has bugs, i agree, but it is usefull, especially since zorbec hasn't updated his for a long time

Yeah, the card search on cardgamedb is very unreliable.  Cloak of Lorien is currently listed as a tactics card.  For some reason Eomer shows up last in the alphabet.  I know I've run into other mistakes like that.

 

Rivendell Councilroom is 10x better, but it doesn't have the spoilers as quickly.  Also it saves locally, so if you deck build on more than one device you won't have access to all of your decks.

If you want to search for cards with special characters like Eomer or Theoden you have to leave out the character with the accent, so you have to type 'omer' for Eomer or 'oden' for Theoden (which both have accented 'e' letters).  Unless you know how to type that character, that is.  It's not consistent though, so I believe you can search Eowyn with no trouble because she her listing doesn't use the special character. Grima is another one like this. Darn you Rohan!

 

The deckbuilder in OCTGN has the same problem.

Yeah, I brought up the issue of needing a better deckbuilder to Caleb at GenCon. He said he'd pass it on. 
cardgamedb is ok but the mobile version is garbage. That's what we really need.
