Greetings, fans of The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game!

Some of you may have noticed recent changes to the Quest Log [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_lotr_gr_main.asp?eidgr=1]. The Quest Log now defaults to show scores logged after November 1st, 2011, the release of the new scoring system [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2782].

This new scoring system lays the foundation for the launch of the game’s organized play program, which is currently being tested by R&D.

None of your old scores have been lost. To view scores entered before November 1st, 2011, you can scroll to the bottom of the page and click a link that will change the date range for the scores you wish to view.

Thanks!

 This seems to make sense - as it removes all the old scores from play that would otherwise skew the averages etc.

 

My only concern is that there's nothing to stop people entering old format scores after November 1st - would it be possible to include a "number of rounds" box, and instead of filtering before /after November 1st, give players an option of whether they enter their scores in version 1.0 or version 2.0 (or whatever the new one is) - that would make it much more explicit for anyone who hasn't read the update, and just logs in to report quests.

Hello all.  I'm new to the community having signed up after discovering the nice LOTR Quest Log.

Question though...I play most of my solo games with multiple decks to simulate multiple players.  I don't see any way to record all the info for a game as I can only enter 3 heroes (not the 6,9,12 that I might play).

Am I missing something?  Or, is the log just meant to capture a single deck solo game or a "real" multi-player game where I'm just one of multiple players?

Thanks.

For multiplayer games, you enter the results of each "player" individually.

this was one of the major complaints  people had when the quest log first came out. Despite all the stuff we've had in the last week or so about "new quest log" they haven't provided any new features, just a filter to shut out pre-November quest entries.

It's all a bit disappointing really.

 I've been playing with a friend 2-player games for a while.  I'm interested in this Quest Log, but it does seem like that it is a real limitation that it cannot properly capture multiplayer (or multi-deck) games.  I would expect this could be implemented so that I could enter a quest result and include my friend's account as one of the players with his own heroes.  These games would then not be used for comparisons.  For a game that has much going for it as a multiplayer game, I think this is an important enhancement the website owners should implement soon!

 That said... thank you, folks at Fantasy Flight games for developing a useful website and forum for this game!  It's not like I am paying a subscription fee to use it, and I realize the business model will have limitations on what you can support for it.  That said, if a moderate subscription fee of $5-10 yearly would enable significant enhancements to the site, I would support it.  Maybe even monthly, but there are probably many that would not be able to afford this in our current economy.

 I am having trouble viewing quest log entries from the last two days -- is it a problem with the new 2012 dates?  It says I have logged them correctly, but they do not show up in the quest view.

I had the same problem yesterday. When I tried to log a quest I completed on January 1, 2012, it happened just as you say. I then tried logging the exact same information but changed the date as if the game was played on December 31, 2011 - it worked like a charm.

Something is currently wrong with the Quest Log and making entries dated 2012.

Change date to something like 31.12.2012 for example. I think that system works as everything before november goes to the old system jar. But it checks the month before november without counting year. Or the new year is the problem.

Looks to be working now. I'd been logging everything as December 31st, but a few times I'd forgotten, submitted on the real date, and had to redo the record. Those "lost" records showed up in my quest log, and the current date can now be properly submitted.

 Hey, 

I try to compare my quest log with the one from a friend. However, I always get a err=no_friend_db message in the address bar and can't see her results.

However, when she compares her quest log to mine, it works. What did I miss? I added the QuestLog to my game resoruces as well. 

 

Furthermore, I would also love to be able to add all the heroes of multiplayer games instead of just one player's heroes.

## 21 [Bjorne on March 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55743-changes-to-the-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=606364)

So, the way I understand this is that you are supposed to log the total team score, but do it several times if you are more than one player(deck), right?

Example, Adam and Anna get 150pts in total for one game (the combined team score). Anna logs the play as 2-players, 150pts and puts her heroes in. Adam logs the game as 2-players, 150pts and puts his heroes in.

Is this the right way to do it?

## 22 [Bjorne on March 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55743-changes-to-the-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=607040)

Plus,

There doesn't seem to be a way to see how many times you failed a quest. What is the point of being able to log failed quests if you can't see the full statistics afterwards?

 

## 23 [Ezel on March 24, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55743-changes-to-the-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=609815)

The quest log is the absolutely most interesting feature on this site for me (since the rules when signing up says this isn't for asking about rules, which in it self is strange).

But it leaves so much to offer! I really hope there will be some work done on it!

At the moment I think we all have to log our quests elsewhere in some way, paper or .txt-file, and hope features get added.

What bugged me today was that I, as a new player, didn't know about the revised scoring. So I did some quests, and learned the game, and finally completed the some quests, Hurray Hurray! So I wanted to log my games and learn about revised scoring and of course I haven't been counting turns! Darn!

Now, that my scores won't be counted since they don't fit the new scoring, that's fine with me (but might not be with others), but I of course still want to log my games and write a bit about what I did right/wrong and what tactics/strategy I tried to use and what was exacting in the game. But what score do I put in the score-field?
I tried leaving it empty, but that didn't work. O tried entering 9999 points but I guess that really screws up my stats. I tried entering 0 points but I guess that also screws with my stats (and is a real obtainable score also I think?).

Do I have to resort to GUESSING my score since I don't know how many turns? Or do I have to abandon my long musings about my early adventures in the game totally? What if the scoring changes again? Am I supposed to check this site before every time I play the game since the scoring-system might have changed since last time and my score-calculations might be useless?

Well. . That's one thing I think REALLY must be fixed!

And of course we also want to be able to enter the full deck one used and so on. . . ;-)

That's the same question I am wondering, or do we add the rounds to each players individual score? I play two decks so do I enter my group of heros twice?  Under the scoring system suggested by Bjorne, the players will have the same score.  But inwhat I suggested the players will have different scores.

I think bjorne is right, does anyone know for sure?  If this is the correct method it's annoying that I'd have to enter my two groups of heros as two different games even though they have the same score.

 I have a question on the Quest Log for Quests where you lose. 

It appears you can enter a quest with a 'fail' result but then they don't seem to appear in your quest summary. Is there something I am missing or are they dismissed? 

 

Thanks!

 Recently I decided to log also failed quest for my own record keeping. Now it seems that the quest log does display them correctly (under logged quests) but it also does something weird. It assumes for some internal purposes that failed quest has a score of 50 and for this reason it does not highlight your best scores in green as it used to be (as long as you logged at least 1 fail and not achieved a score lower that 50 for a scenario).

If fails need to have a score for some internal application purpose it should assume the score of 1000 or so we can easily locate the attempts with best results for a given quest.

I tried using this for the first time yesterday and I thought I would share my thoughts with the community. I have to say I am completely under-whelmed with the quest log.

Firstly, in a two player game you have to enter each player's heros seperately. Which is fine but my partner does not have a FFG account (she uses me to source rules / queries etc.) I would much prefer to see all of the heros being logged in 2/3/4 player scenarios as it will make a huge difference depending on what sphere's they belong to and what their traits are as there is no way of linking accounts with the completed/failed quests in the log.

Secondly, I wanted to make a play by play account of our adventure. We played The Watcher in the Water (first time for playing that quest as well). We got lucky but still won with a very repectable score of 136 for two players. However there is no where to log what was revealed from the encounter deck, who played what card, who killed what etc. I had to resort to typing all of this information into the log which added about an hour to the game time (I'm not the quickest of typists).

Thirdly, the summary shows the community average score for that quest. Again we had a very respectable score and we were only 2.46 points below the average. But I can't see what the best score for that quest is. In any of the player modes - solo, 2, 3 or 4 player. So I have no idea if the average is everyone all being roughly around that score of if the best 2 player score is something like 70 and the worst is something like 200 and everything in between is balancing it out.

So to summarise, I will probably use the quest log again, but without typing a small essay of how we progressed. The term 'quest log' implies it is a documentary of what we did, what we encountered and how we overcame (or failed) that particular quest. I think it is more of a online quest scoring system with a few statistics added in for good measure. I believe a lot more can be done with this which will make this a truely useful and pleasing addition to the game. However in it's current guise I am a disappointed with it, but do believe the scope is there for it to be really good.

I'm thinking about attempting a statistic report page much like the one AH has here on the forums. 

https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=paPMgoencsRppq3PEYWXmQQ&hl=en.  [https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=paPMgoencsRppq3PEYWXmQQ&hl=en.%C2%A0]

You can see it wil be a lot of work. The varied nature of the quests would probably require a seperate page for each quest. 

Something like- page 1 overall stats- number of "players", heroes used, score, (maybe  expansions used). Then a link to a second page with specifics by quest. you may have to reenter the same information from the 1st page twice, I can't think of an easy way to have it transfer over. I am wiling to do all the "coding", hosting and calculating, but I don't have enough time to play through all the quests to find the highlights that would require logging. 

I don't think a turn by turn log is something a could handle, Ideally I would want a set of check boxes of the exceptional stuff. a way to maybe add a note if something amazing happens and a way to view overall stats for all entries, overall stats for each quest, and personal (local group) stats for both also.

I would be using Numbers and saving as Excel and posting to Google Docs, and hoping the formatting doesn't get goofed by the badness that is Excel. I use both Numers and Excel but am mostly a Mac user so if anyone knows how to deal with the problems that might arise any tips would be much apreciated.

This venture might take some time to get going and I don't want to start a thred on it until it happens so just post any thoughts you have here or PM me.   

What I'm looking for right now is any help anyone might be willing to give and a by quest or by encounter deck symbol list of exceptional happenings.

Anyone knows if the easy and nightmare mode will eventually be supported in the Quest Log, either by making each quest appear multiple times (with the easy / standard / nightmare qualifier as part of the quest name) or by adding a field to indicate the difficulty used (first option is much better, for the sake of comparing scores between people)?
