Rulebook doesn't displayes ones.

So I technically can't play any non-response events inbetween attacking and defending, can't for example ready character with attached unexpected courage to him after defending for him to be able to attack and stuff?

There are action windows between the different steps of defending and attacking (see page 18 and 20). So it is e.g. posible to defend with a hero, and in the action window between step 3 (resolving shadow effect) and 4 (determining damage), you can ready the hero with Unexpected Courage. He will be able to attack or defend against another enemy.

Thank you kindly. Missed it out somehow. Well, I wish I knew this yesterday, then I would beat this scenario…
