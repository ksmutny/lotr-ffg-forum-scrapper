Hey everybody. With the announcement of the new major expansion and Watcher in the Water coming out soon and yet to have a hero announced, I was just wondering what are people's thoughts on what heroes you'd like to see. Keep in mind this doesn't have to be who you think it's actually going to be, just heroes that you think should be included at some point. Personally I'd really like to see Theoden, he was always one of my favorite characters and could potentially be something similar to Dain where he has a "leadership effect" due to being King of Rohan. Anybody else?

elrond, faramir (he was always one of my favourites), sam, merry, pippin

Yes! Meriadoc and Peregrin

Yeah, seems like the members of the Fellowship should all get their appearances. I think they've already gone away from the "17 years between Bilbo's birthday and leaving the Shire" thing because Frodo has been included as a hero, as has Eowyn and several others where the ages don't quite add up. Pippin and Merry will be interesting for sure, as I'm sure Sam will. Has anyone else been picturing Sam as a Spirit hero with A LOT of willpower? Because of any character in the Lord of the Rings universe, Sam had to have a lot of willpower and heart. Without him Frodo would've died many times over. I'd also like to see Elrond, I know he's been mentioned as a Gandalf like ally, but I don't think he'd be totally unreasonable as a powerful, high threat hero or something. Another elf I'd like to see included is Thranduil (Legolas' father). I guess last cycle would've been a better time for him to come out, but I guess there's always hope.

 Good thoughts about Sam! I haven't actually thought much about him, but he would definitely be fun to have.

Haldir as a hero. Bain. The three hobbits already mentioned.

I wouldn't mind seeing the other two heroes from Middle Earth Quest, since they already included three of them.

I've always thought of Sam more inclined to Lore, not sure why but the Fast Hitch card having a Sam quote on it may have something to do with it...

Thranduil as a hero would be nice, not sure where he would go though. Leadership? Perhaps. Eomer as a Tactics hero would be marvellous!

I'm still hoping we only get Elrond as an ally. Galadriel too. They are, to me, more guiding hands than active players, so I think it'd just be weird. Though Celeborn would be a nice hero, I'm sure. I'm not too fussed on getting Merry and Pippin, though.

I just have to agree with most what the above says. Eomer for Tactics, Thranduil Leadership. It feels natural. Then Theoden another Leadership. All heroes. And Elrond and Galadriel as allies, Lore and Spirit respectively.

As for Over Hill and Under Hill, if they follow the story only, it shall be hard to think up 10 heroes in total: Bilbo, Thorin, Balin, Beorn (really looking forward to that one as the ally version is not that satisfactory), Thranduil, Bard, and what next? Hope not Gandalf (his ally version is totally satisfactory), and not every Dwarf of the Company should be hero either.

I'm not so sure they are going to put 10 new heros with this Hobbit expansions. As I see it, is that there would be a total of 5 heros between the 2 Hobbit expansions, 2 each (as in khazad-dum), and the extra special Bilbo in the first one to put working the new Baggins sphere. That would make the 5 heros they say in the article.

Just what make sense to me.

And my likings would be Thorin (leadership) and Balin (spirit) for the first one, with Bilbo of course, and Bardo (Tactics) and maybe another dwarf for lore, not sure about this one.

Cheers.

It would make sense to me as well. I just thought I read this box is coming with five. I will check again. And it may be that his one is coming with five but it will be different for the other.

If I had to vote for 5 in the Hobbit, it would be Bilbo, Thorin, Beorn, Thranduil and Bard.

ps: Just checked here http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=136&esem=1 [http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=136&esem=1] - it does indeed say five heroes coming in this one. And if that shall only cover the first half of the story, it seems given we get Bilbo, Thorin, Balin, Beorn plus one other, perhaps Elrond. Surely we shall not see 3 Dwarves, we have got 6 now already, others would like some love, too!

I doubt we'll ever get an istari hero... there roles in the story are just so much more suited for the ally cards. The same goes for elrond (i'd love to see some of the while council as heroes, but... they're all in the background of these stories).

I'd love a thorin hero, and figure we'll get one in the upcoming hobbit game.

I think we could use a theodin leader for our rohirm. Faramir would be good, as stated. I also wouldn't mind some remakes of already existing heroes that fill in some of their other abilities. Aragorn is a great quester and fighter... but he was also a king and an actual leader. I wouldn't mind a remake of him that reflects his ability to boost the gondor cards.

 

Same goes for Boramir. A leadership Boramir would be great. Likewise, Boramir walked like, a million miles by himself from Gondor to Rivendell. I think a willpower 3+ tactics boromir wouldn't be out of the question, and would really help the tactics faction for solo colored decks.

 

As stated, the other 3 hobbits would be nice, and are needed.

I would like to see a tactics hero that has some willpower, as was mentioned. I'm not sure it should be Boromir, but I think the idea is long overdue. Tactics needs SOMETHING to be a viable sphere. I also agree with whomever said that they hope Gandalf does not make an appearance as a hero. He is so thematically right on the money it isn't even funny. He's always leaving and appearing at just the right moment to save the day, just like in the card game. Eomer is another character I think needs to make an appearance in the game at some point, and Tactics probably would be the sphere for him. I think he would make a great candidate for the hero with a higher willpower for tactics, as he was a great leader as well as a fighter. I think Thranduil would fit best as a leadership hero, he's the King of Mirkwood after all. I guess I haven't really thought about what 5 heroes are coming out with the big expansion, rather Watcher in the Water. Hoping it's a spirit hero!

Well, considering the changes to 'regular' gameplay introduced in the forthcoming 'saga' expansion I could imagine an expansion dedicated to playing a bunch of Istari heroes in a truly epic scenario. That might be fun!

Eomer please.

Maybe Aragorn as "Strider"?

I think the Aragorn we have is more reflective of "Strider" then of "Aragorn".

I agree with that.  Would still be cool to have a hero card named Strider though, but obviously he would have to have some text reading "cannot be in play while Aragorn is in play," or something like that.  After all we're going to have two versions of Bilbo now.  I would imagine Strider having an ability similar to the Lorien Guide or Northern Tracker, as well as Sentinel.

We have a symbol in this game that represents "Unique". In the star wars miniatures they had a special ability called "unique" as well. What they did in the game was put on the cards "Counts as __________". They could just do that "Counts as Aragorn", and the unique symbol would take care of the rest.

Not to put down any ideas, but I think the last thing they should do is re-release heroes. The number of characters that they could easily make into more heroes is huge, and aside from the large expansions they only release one at a time. I guess I can understand the Bilbo re-release, as they want to keep the game fresh and keep coming out with new ideas, and this is a way to do that. But I hardly think they've come up with all the heroes they can and have to start rehashing old ones. I'd be horribly disappointed to see Aragorn or any hero really come up again, even in a very different style of card. Just my personal thoughts though.

And I suppose there could be some expansion that features the Istari to a large extent, but if they're planning on releasing a "Gandalf the Grey" hero card with the new large expansion I think it's a mistake. Not only from the aspect that he fits really well where he is, but the fact that I don't think I could make a deck that doesn't include him. He's just too awesome. I guess FFG could make it so he's a well balanced but powerful hero and it'd be up to you whether or not you want ot use him, and I admit I totally would. He is probably the most popular Lord of the Rings character, so eventually I'd imagine he will be released as a hero, be it soon or in some future expansion.

i agree- there a dozens of characters in middle earth that could be released, half of them characters that may not even spring to mind first.....i think they should stick with that...i mean the games just a year old, they shouldnt be re releasing people yet

I think it would be awesome to see more custom heros. The non-sage adventures are independent of the books so it would make sense to add more characters unique to this game. It gives FFG more freedom to make whatever they want willout having to deal with timelines and age issues.

I am also not a fan for characters appearing again. I think they should only EVER re-realease those which they got wrong, aka Glorfindel. I know not everybody will agree upon that one but the consensus is easily there. Either way, bad choices will happen and those characters should be given another chance. Otherwise, it is really unnecessary to repeat those who we have already got.

Really like the new Aragorn. I'm a bit of a Pippin-type player, and he's a Pippin-tastic hero. I do find it interesting that there are now two Aragorn-specific attachments, while no other hero has even one. Definitely looking forward to this AP.

 Ileimmoen mentioned in another thread (and others have the same sentiment) that he would like to see a new Glorfindel, even if it is a repeat. Now, I seem to remember people saying he would have been better as a Tactics player and this has got me thinking. See, I never expected repeat heroes to have the same stats because it would make their niches too similar, but both of our repeat heroes have the exact same threat, willpower, attack, defense, and hit points. This actually does make me hopeful for a Tactics sphere Glorfindel because we'd finally get a Tactics hero with a 3 for willpower, assuming they maintain this trend of 2nd version heroes with identical stats to the first.

I do want to clarify my feelings on these two, though I've said it before in a long-buried thread. The thing that really inspired me about these two is their dramatic change throughout the trilogy. My favorite part was when they returned to The Shire at the end because they didn't realize how much they had changed, and the reader didn't realize how much they had changed, but when they were put back where they started, it was plain to see how much they had developed and grown in courage. The image of them riding through the town in their armor got me so excited. It is that rendition of Merrry and Pippin that I would like to see. The timeline makes it unlikely that we'll see them, since that is pretty much the very end of the third age (or had the 4th age begun by that point?), but the Saga Expansions give me hope that we may some day return to The Shire to fight orcs and overthrow Saruman, and maybe, just maybe, Peregrin of the Guard and Meriadoc of the Mark will be there to aid in that quest.

As someone who really wants to like Tactics, I'd be whining less if they suddenly decided to throw a 3 willpower Glorfindel into that sphere. Lol.

Thanks for sharing the thought. Bilbo does not have the same stats exactly but I see what you are saying, I believe if they make new Glorfindel he shall indeed have the same stats (even though the low defence is a bit laughable thematicaly). The designer said he shall either be Tactics or Spirit, if he is spirit we might even see him up next but Tactics would really do with a 3 willpower hero. What I am most looking forward to is a new and better ability though.

I think what was meant was who is the second repeated hero beside Aragorn: well the also-previewed Bilbo.

Anyway, as for heroes whose threat cost does not match the sum of their other stats: Bilbo (Lore), Bifur, Elladan, Elrohir.

Let's see an Ent hero.  Perhaps Fangorn/Treebeard for fun.  What Sphere would he be?  Lore?

Do you think they may create dual sphere heroes?  Maybe an Ent could be Lore and/or Spirit.

I hope they will not create a double-coloured hero since it is now becoming easier and easier to creat one during the game.

I also wish to see Ents, it may take a while but I think we are definitely ready for more Creatures. I know it may sound strange to call them so but same goes for Eagles. Perhaps we shall see Ents when a cycle turns to Rohan. And I guess they should be Lore.

I would not mind a dual sphere hero if it may assist with Secrecy.  Perhaps with such a hero we will only be allowed a max of 2 heroes.  It would be the type of hero that has high risk and high reward I think.

 I'd like to see a few more invented characters like Eleanor and Berevor.  Firstly it would be weird if they ended up as the only ones not taken from the books, and secondly to spread out the release of the more famous heroes.

 I strongly suspect we'll see a Tauriel in one of The Hobbit sagas, but maybe just as an ally like Haldir.

At some point they will do a Rohan cycle and we'll see Eomer, as with Faramir during a Gondor cycle.

Seems to me Ents would make better allies than heroes, Lore maybe.  Or perhaps an objective ally from the encounter deck.  I just don't see Ents trapesing through Moria.  But I'd like to see more hobbits.  It doesn't make much sense for Sam or Pippin, though, thematically since they didn't do anything but stay home until the Big Adventure, but Merry had been out and about before.  And there's also Fredegar Bolger, too. 

Definitely need more Silvan heroes, though.  I like the new Strider, but I still wish they'd have included a new Lore hero rather than repeat a hero already.

Hahaha.  I'm just imagining Ents walking around as heroes now all through out.   Even as Allies, they'd be out of place I guess.

I'm still not sure how I feel about it.  Eventually the game will run out of characters even in a world as big as Middle Earth.  And we already have Eleanor, Beravor & Thalin.

im not so fussed about ffg created characters- as long as they do a good job- which they have done so far- the line with me would be including (well not literally including, but near enough including) content from other areas- ie the films

I would like to see Éomer as a tactics hero.

He might have 3 willpower and solve the problem with the low questing abilities of tactics. Also you could use him to create a spirit/tactics rohan deck with those nice horseback archers and maybe new tactic rohan allies.

No way, Tauriel is a creation of Peter Jackson and so FFG has no rights to use that name. They''d get sued up the wazoo.

I do want to see Argalad and Eometh from Middle Earth Quest though. Especially Argalad could be coming soon. I''d like to see him as a Spirit Silvan hero who''s focused around defense or maybe even a quester to challenge Eowyn.

I strongly agree. I really like the new characters and I'm very curious what FFG could come up with. I think there is nothing wrong with venture a little bit away from the books storyline and heroes, but staying close to its heart and core feeling of the Middle Earth World.

Also, I would love to see a second version of Eowyn. I was a little sceptical about the two Aragorns, but now I like the idea. For some characters in the book it could work (not for everyone). Eowyn has two aspects as well. She is not only a shieldmaid and quester, but a brave fighter. So maybe a tactics Eowyn would be possible ^^ Or maybe I like her too much gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 The only reason I'll somewhat agree with releasing made up heroes is for the reason stated, and that's to space out the heroes that we all know and love. I'm starting to think that no matter what heroes they put out, they need to start looking at what each sphere is missing. Tactics obviously needs someone who can quest, as the highest willpower any hero has is two and most of the allies they have are either 0 or 1. I like the idea of Eowyn making an appearance for Tactics, hopefully she'd retain some of her high willpower though!
