If you have Love of Tales attached to hero you are playing Lay of Nimrodel, and he has...., for example, 5 resources (he has 5 reosurces when you play on him Lay of Numrodel from another resource pool)... the question is: how many willpower do you increase?

5? the resources he had when you play the song event?

or 6? because after, as a response, loves of tales gets +1 resource by playing song Lay of Numrodel?

the right order should be :

- pay cost of the card

- resolve card

- resolve "card is played" response

 

The lay of nimrodel's effect must be resolved to be considered played.
