If prince Imrahil is a hero when Caldara is in the discard pile he ends up collecting resources when he's a hero correct?

What happens if I get caldara back in play, can I spend unused resources when he is no longer a hero?

Yes, as a hero, he will collect resources. 

 

So the rules state you are to spend resources from heroes to play from cards.  So while he does not have the hero statues, I don't think you can use his resources anymore.  It's the same reasoning that you can't spend resources from Radagast to pay for neutral things.  It is only by his card text that he can generate resources and it explains how they can be spend.

That's what I figured, but the resources don't get discarded do they? What about attachments that are hero only? If you stick them on him while he was a hero, I assume those would have to be removed if he was no longer a hero?

Lots of these things came up when I used him but I haven't seen anyone all this stuff yet

Hero-only attachments stay. LotR does not recheck for legality once attached. It's how Gandalf can have A Burning Brand.

yep.   The various restrictions on attachments only apply at the time you are attaching it.   Like Kakita says, it doesn't keep checking those restrictions - like Game of Thrones attachments do.

However most hero-specific attachments say "Attached hero gets [whatever]." Since Imrahil is not a hero he is not the attached hero and thus doesn't get the effect from such things until he becomes a hero again.

Does that also apply to text on the attached card (eg "Cannot have attachments"), assuming it's been blanked? I'm not sure how to exploit that (Beorn is also "Immune to player card effects," so most attachments won't work on him anyway once he's un-blanked), but using Sword-Thain to make Bill the Pony a hero might just be a valuable end in itself.

No it does not apply to "cannot have attachments".  The attachment would get discarded as soon as the text box became active again in this case.  "Cannot have attachments" is not a restriction on the playing of the attachment.  It means that the enemy cannot have attachments regardless of whether they are played, or already on them, or put into play by other means, or attached after already being in play (such as a trap).
