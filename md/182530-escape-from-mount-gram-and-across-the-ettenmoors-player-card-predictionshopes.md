## 1 [PsychoRocka on July 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182530-escape-from-mount-gram-and-across-the-ettenmoors-player-card-predictionshopes/?do=findComment&comment=1692789)

So now that we have the first AP from the new Angmar Awakened Cycle what do you think we will get in the next few packs?

 

As for the heroes we are getting a lore hero in Mount Gram and a defensive tactics hero in Across the Ettenmoors. Who do you think our other Lore hero will be in this cycle? (other than Erestor in Treachery of Rhuadar). Perhaps Cirdan? Or do you think he will be spirit and not lore?

Perhaps even an Arwen hero, she doesn't have to be spirit like her ally version. 

As for the defensive tactics hero people have guessed perhaps Dori based on this leaked artwork:

https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182133-yet-another-leaked-piece-of-art/page-1 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182133-yet-another-leaked-piece-of-art/page-1]

This art might very well just be for an upcoming ally rather than a hero or it could even be the art for a new attachment that goes on dwarves. If so who else could this Defensive hero be? Gamling? A new version of an existing hero? What are your thoughts?

 

On to the rest of the player cards. In Mount Gram we are getting Distant Stars which has been discussed on the forums and is expected to trivialise certain quests that rely on certain locations being in play such as Journey to Rhosgobel. It looks to be a pretty powerful card and nice addition to location control allowing you to bail on a non unique active location (avoiding its when explored effects) and discard it without exploring it. You also get to search for any other non unique location in the encounter deck and make it the new active location. Keep in mind there are many quests where there are at least one or two locations that either give positive effects instead of negative effects or are very harmless and simple. I think a big question is whether you need to exhaust a ranger or scout hero or ally to use this card. It is worth noting it is an action not a response so can be used at any time (that actions can be played obviously) and can be used to specifically remove an active location that is going to boost enemies during the combat phase for example. It is also 0 cost aside from requiring you to exhaust a character.

Descendants of Kings is a one cost leadership event. Perhaps it will boost Dunedain decks or have an effect that ties in with engaging enemies. Maybe it allows you to declare an immediate attack against an enemy that just engaged you? Maybe it does direct damage to an enemy that just engaged you (unlikely and would be very strange in leadership). Maybe it allows you to stop an enemy just engaged from making an attack for a turn? (like feint but you have to have just engaged it). Based on the name and art alone I am finding it extremely hard to imagine what it might do and am basing my guesses purely on the fact it is a dunedain related card. 

 

It is also mentioned we will be getting tactics cards (two apparently) that are ent focused, leadership cards that encourage direct action against the enemy (descendants of kings is probably one of these and this is another indicator that it will do something based on engaging enemies) and two cards that support a new mechanic based around manipulating the encounter deck and the victory display (Keen as Lances and Leave no Trace). I think we will get another tactics ent ally and perhaps an event that boosts all ents for a turn or another ent based attachment. I think an ally and event are more likely though. 

As for Keen as Lances and Leave no Trace what are your thoughts thus far?

I am strongly considering including and running x3 copies of each and the one copy of Scout Ahead in my decks and seeing how this runs. I want to see on average how discounted the first copy of Keen as Lances played each round is. I want to see on average how much is payed for each copy. Depending on this it may replace Galadrims Greeting in many decks (and mine!) as it reduces threat by just one point less but can cost FAR LESS and in neutral resources and can also draw you cards or put resources on a specific hero instead. The only downside is it cannot reduce any players threat and can only benefit the user. The upside to this though is that any player can run copies of Keen as Lances even if only one player is running Leave no Trace and only a few players have a copy of Scout Ahead in their deck. In this situation after playing a single copy of leave no trace and a single copy of Keen as Lances (for 3 instead of 5 so long as you played leave no trace first) all other copies will cost 2. If you manage to play another copy of Leave no Trace they go down to 0 cost!! This particular AP may be one that people actually buy multiple copies of as you may want 6 copies of Keen as Lances or potentially even more as each player can run it in multiplayer (or two handed) to great effect furthering the potential discount and chance to discount future copies. 

 

Now my main concern for these three cards and this combo/strategy is that it is fairly unreliable. If you don't get any copies of leave no trace but end up with more than one copy of keen as lances as much as the second copy will cost 4 they will both be massively overpriced. Scout Ahead is a x1 only card (as all the player side quests appear they will be) so is also unreliable in reducing the cost of keen as lances. Pretty much you need to have at least one copy of Leave no Trace played to make Keen as Lances worth playing. At 3 cost it is not bad and will also reduce the next copy to 2 cost. This is problematic because Leave no Trace is really not that great. Yes it puts a nasty location in the victory display stopping it from coming out again but this is a very tame effect and one that could very well do nothing in many games or any games of two players or less where the encounter deck does not get shuffled nearly as often. It also costs a resource and is not free. This means you have to have/draw and then play a very mediocre card to be able to use a very good card. Now in the article for Mount Gram they have specified that: 
"Of course, we've already seen that other cards from the cycle can manipulate the victory display, such as Scout Ahead (The Wastes of Eriador, 9), and we can expect that other cards in the cycle will allow us to transfer our control over the victory display into a greater measure of control over the encounter deck." which does indicate that we will get other similar cards in this cycle. Will there actually be other cards that allow you to put cards worth no victory points in the victory display that will directly improve Keen as Lances or are they just referring to The Door is Closed? What would be REALLY nice is a one cost tactics or leadership event that is identical to Leave no Trace but allows you to add an enemy just destroyed (that is non unique and worth no victory points) to the victory display instead of a location. If we do get even just one more card that directly boosts/discounts Keen as Lances and is just a tiny bit more playable than Leave no Trace I think it will be a very viable strategy and will almost definitely be one I employ in my decks. 

 

Now for the few player cards we know about in Across the Ettenmoors. Hope rekindled is a nice discount/fetch card for valour decks that won't really see any play till we get the majority of the valour event cards. Dunedain Message will be great in decks that have multiple side quests and because it is a signal it can be fetched itself by weather hills watchman. Any decks that have strategies that specifically interact with their side quests will want to use this card as it allows you to get out that one of side quest that you normally would only see every x amount of games in the majority of games so long as you draw one of your copies of Dunedain Message. Only decks that feature 2/3 or more side quests or have strategies that directly interact with the featured side quests will have any use for this card though I think. The one card we saw but have no idea what it does is None Return. It has very strange art and seems to be a forest clearing with a group of dead orcs? I very much so doubt it will do anything so awesome but it would be amazing if it did the following: "Discard each enemy that has taken at least one damage from a Silvan or Noldor hero this round".

More Tactics Ent cards have been confirmed? Man, we've seen Wellinghall Custodian spoiled for lore and Ent decks are already quite powerful. My girlfriend loves playing hobbits + ents in multiplayer, so this is going to be fun.

 

edit: I was hoping for Tale of Tinúviel in the first or second pack, but it looks like we'll be waiting until Dread Realm. Quite excited about the new Lore hero, though!

I hope the Lore hero in Mount Gram works with all this victory display thing and somehow makes it into a viable archetype, or else I fear we'll have yet another half-a**ed mechanic like secrecy that needed another cycle to be somewhat complete.

## 4 [Fingolfin Fate on July 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182530-escape-from-mount-gram-and-across-the-ettenmoors-player-card-predictionshopes/?do=findComment&comment=1693410)

Nice post. I will try my best from different angles.

 

Ents. I am surprised we did not see Wellinghall Custodian in Wastes. Because Mount Gram mentions two Tactics Ent-related cards. Ettenmoors promises more Ents though, without sphere specification, so he might show up there. I still think Ent decks are far from ready, we need many more of their cards, and not just allies.

 

Keen as Lances. I think it will be good. I hope Leave No Trace will be very effective for a number cards, however, since it does almost nothing off itself.

 

Tactics defender. I believe it will be Dori. I think he will for sure be a sentinel with all the focus on the keyword: Helm, Hold Your Ground! I am not too excited about him since I hardly ever play Dwarves and there are good defenders in the game already. Still, it will be nice to see a version of one of the Company of Thorin.

 

Lore hero. I am super excited about him. I hope it is Gildor Inglorion, one of my all-time favourite characters (it sounds weird from the couple of pages but it is true). And yes, encounter deck manipulation, please! I like it a lot. It would be great if it somehow works with hero Denethor as well.

 

Dúnedain/Signals. I am yet to build a good Dúnedain-theme deck. For some reason they are not so compelling for me, not nearly as much as Elves, or Gondor, or even Rohan. It is strange because I really like the faction in the source material.

 

I am excited about Valour cards. All the previews seem promising, though I am not sure about Hope Rekindled.

 

I am also so far very dubious about side-quests. Some of them, Scout Ahead especially, seem very powerful but they seem very quest dependent. Lately, there have been few quests in which I would say I have time to linger. Now that I think about it, won't there be very good against Helm's Deep?

 

ps: Psychorocka, I got the Atlas, it is wonderful

Why is no one including Out Of The Wild in their discussions of Leave No Trace and Keen As Lances this time around? Other than the cost when you are outside of secrecy, this is an amazing card. If you're playing multiplayer, then it shouldn't be too much difficulty to get one player to play a secrecy deck with Lore and pile these cards together along with Risk Some Light and really control the encounter deck.

Yeah I forgot to mention Out of the Wild. I feel like that makes the whole keen as lances/leave no trace etc combo worthwhile but ONLY in secrecy as out of the wild really is not very good for its full cost... good point though.

## 7 [joezim007 on July 16, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182530-escape-from-mount-gram-and-across-the-ettenmoors-player-card-predictionshopes/?do=findComment&comment=1693843)

> Yeah I forgot to mention Out of the Wild. I feel like that makes the whole keen as lances/leave no trace etc combo worthwhile but ONLY in secrecy as out of the wild really is not very good for its full cost... good point though.

 

You could also play it with Pippin and Good Meal regardless of secrecy status, though Pippin is best in secrecy decks (or at least low threat decks) anyway.

 

Also, how about Scout Ahead, which we just got? Sadly it can only be 1 per deck, but it helps.

I mentioned scout ahead in my rant, it definitely does help but yeah limit of 1 means it is not very reliable unless you can fetch it. Yeah exactly you may as well be running a secrecy deck if you are using Pippin. You're right though there are ways to make it work without secrecy but they just seem a bit too finicky or unreliable. Really hope we get at least one more card that can add cards without victory points to the victory display. Even just a strong player card that has a hefty cost and does something powerful (unlike leave no trace which is good but definitely not great) and adds itself to the victory display so it can only be used once (but has no victory points) would make this mechanic way better.

I hope we get many more. And they pretty much said it. I expect at least five cards supporting the strategy, plus the hero.

I don't want to derail the thread or anything, but I think it's funny how we get so attached to these characters that have basically no role in the books.  For me, it's DEFINITELY Rumil and Orophin, but particularly Orophin. I was excited out of my mind when we got a player card of him!

For me it's Cirdan. I've never been able to figure out why, but he's one of my favourite characters.

Off the top of my head, if I should list favourite characters from LotR, there would be Gildor Inglorion, Glorfindel, Boromir, Sméagol, Treebeard and Gandalf. And of those, only Gandalf is there throughout (more or less), Boromir and Sméagol are both important characters (to the story as well) but their feature is rather episodic, and the other three totally episodic. Tolkien does this really very well, creating iconic characters without giving them many pages in his epic.

Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast (As an ornithologist, I have a thing with animals) and Gimli are among my favorite characters. I am ry interested also in the Fell Beasts and the creatures that carry Grond to Minas Tirith. Whence they came from and what are their ancestors? Cirdan is also fascinating. How did he know Gandalf had such a huge part ro play and could use the help of Narya? A lot of things that remain unknown are most interesting to me. That's why I think Dwarves are the coolest race of ME. They are so mysterious and have so many lore to them. Evem if you think about the races of Dwarves that live outside the known boundaries of North-west Middle-earth... I could go on and on.

To derail this even more, I will address Círdan's affection toward Gandalf. Well, there were only five Istari who were sent to deal with Sauron, so Círdan knew these should be among the most important players in the upcoming war. Throughout the works of Tolkien, you can see that the power of the characters is very often portrayed through their appearance -- I mean one sees them and acknowledges their power (either right away or eventually but often by their presence only). And of course, some can feel this power better than others, thus it is no wonder that Círdan, being one of the very eldest in the whole Middle-earth would have a very keen sight.

 

I like the fact that Varda realizes Olorin (Gandalf in Valinor) is afraid of Sauron and therefor sends him to raise others against him. And she gets proven right, of course. Where Curunín (Saruman) was proud and not afraid of Sauron, his failure was in a way predetermined. We see this throughout the works as well, especially in the Silmarillion: that pride leads to fall.

Yes, of course. It could also we be possible that Cirdan knew of the choosing of the Istari and in what order they would arrive; Gandalf lives up to the 'last but not least'. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Though I do not agree with the judgement that Radagastforesook his mission. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Me neither. I really like Radagast. I would wish to read more about him after the encounter with Gandalf and Saruman in May 3018 (if my dates are correct). And of course, I would like to know more about the Blue Wizzards, but we probably never shall, unless Christopher digs out more stuff from the drawers.

Yes, I have always wondered where Radagast went. Especially since Rhosgobel was empty when people searched for him.

No, I wouldn't think so either. That's even more depressing then the Children of Hurin.

Oh, I really liked Children of Húrin though. It is very, very depressing at times but uplifting at others. One needs the right mind-set for it but it is a very moving piece. And could make a great movie, too. (Though I keep no hopes for the rights to ever be sold. But maybe one day there will be no need for rights like that.)

The Istari's formation in Valinor is one of my favorite parts of the Unfinished Tales. I recently read an article on tor.com talking about Saruman and his motives as a character. Very fascinating. Also, the author brought up the point that Saruman probably got his affinity for machines and ring-making, as we see he uses in the Lord of the Rings, from originally being a "pupil" of Aule. And Gandalf probably got his likes/dislikes from his Valar mentors, which were Nienna and... Manwe? Not sure. But we also know that Alatar, one of the blue wizards, was a "pupil" of Orome. So, most likely, we know that Alatar (and probably Pallando too, since he is described simply as his "friend") had some traits and characteristics of his Valar mentor, Orome, Valar of the Hunt.  

If we ever do get to go to the east and find the blue wizards, I think that modeling them after their respective Valar would be the most accurate we can get to how Tolkien originally imagined them.

Yeah, CoH is great!

Part of Unfinished Tales talks about Pallando and Alatar going to the East because of all the Valar Orome had the most knowledge of the East; he ventured there on his horse. Gandalf was indeed from Manwe. Man, this is a fun thread. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The essay on the Istari is my favorite part in UT. Quest for Erebor was also a really interesting part. I never knew that Thorin and Co (including Gimli btw) set up shop somewhere else. I should really buy the Atlas!

And it's interesting that Sauron himself was associated with Aule originally before "defecting" to Morgoth. In Tolkien, the power of crafting and creation is generally associated with temptation towards corruption, as we can also see with someone like Feanor.

That certainly seems to be the trend.  But there are some exceptions.  Celebrimbor, off the top of my head.  Also, I guess we should give Aule himself credit, because he seemed to be... Not evil. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]   Unless you count the creation of the Dwarves as evil...

The trend makes sense since Tolkien had rather conservative view towards technological progress. He witnessed the english countryside being destroyed by industrialization and war, and he had a deep love for nature, so it figures that he is more or less reluctant to progress and machines, and it really shows in his works. That's an aspect of his literature that, depite being called old-fashioned or too conservative, still makes it relevant in today's world.

Yeah, Aule and Melkor/Morgoth himself were said to be similar because they both dabbled in the creation/craft realm, but Aule was decidedly not evil. The main thing that seemed to save Aule was a level of humility. This is best exemplified in the whole Dwarf creation incident, as he created them not out of pride or the will to dominate, but mere impatience, which is a folly but not an evil one. And he was willing to destroy them when Illuvatar confronted him. So it seems like craft/creation does not inevitably lead to evil, but it easily can, because it leads one to believe that they can supplant the creative power of Illuvatar himself.

 

It seems like we have taken the thread off on a tangent, but it is a fun one.

I would say even more relevant today than before, now that more people tend to realize how precious certain things are.

 

I don't think Tolkien would have been against progress in general but the words of Gandalf to Saruman seem to sum it up perfectly: "He who breaks a thing…"

Yes, subcreation can easily lead to evil. It indeed matters with what purpose you create. As Raven1015 said, it was really importamnt that Aule offered to destroy the Dwarves himself, because that showed humility and that is why Eru didn't destroy them after all. Feanor was a subcreator and created things which he became proud od and possessive. This eventually led to his death and a lot of worse things. Celebrimbor on the opposite didn't create to posses. He wanted to create just to create and to buy Galadriels love maybe or at least create something beautiful for him. The endgoal was way different the. sauron had for his Ring.

Yes, I loved the part of the Druadain. Ever since I met Ghan in LotR I want him as ally/hero and some normal wose allies. The story of Cirion and Eorl and the part about the memorial stone of Elendil is also really cool.

Oh, I totally forgot about him actually, Ghan-buri-Ghan, not as a character in the books, but as a potential ally for the saga. However, I feel box V may already be too heavy with candidates. Still, I would love to get Woses as allies -- and Ghan as a hero in the future. I was very intrigued by their culture.

Exciting! Looks like we are in the period where they come out one after another woo! Can't wait for some more spoilers for Mount Gram. The few player cards we have seen glimpses of have a lot of potential and the quest itself sounds really fun and flavoursome.

For me it is Cirdan - cause I think of him like someone who has witnessed everything, he is strong enough to oppose everything, but like all the wise people he stays in his corner waiting for the big need - , then Gildor - cause he is a mystery - and above all Glorfindel ... because he slew the Balrog

It may seem strange to say that the character I'm attached to is the dead Haradrim soldier remarked on by Faramir, perhaps curious is a better word. Either way, the point is that I've always been fascinated about the Haradrim and Easterlings both and would have loved to read more about them. 

 

Although in the case of that particular scene, the mystery about them is what lends the gravity to Faramir's words.

I think that it is a case that "better to save the mystery", thats why so little are known ... I believe that they were intended to resemble African or Asian tribes of the Ancient, who seemed savage but also were thought to have a culture of their own, maybe a bit extreme culture but generally uknown to other people.

 

It is like a land of Mystery. like the Tuareg Sahara or something

In the book, it is Sam who talks about him. And the passage became one of the classics to me right away. Very well done in the movie as well.

 

Tolkien's experience with war played a part here, obviously, how could it not. Empathy prevailed -- which is not that obvious, of course.

Ah yes, it was Sam indeed, I had the movie scene in my head. Although I think it is equally fitting given Faramir's character for him to say the words as well. 

 

I think it's definitely a moment when you can see Tolkien's experiences shining through. It really stands out though, because for the most part, the Harad and Easterlings are otherwise a faceless and monolithic enemy, but that one moment gives them some humanity. I think the mystery about them works well for the story and also fits in with the world that has been depicted, a pre-modern world where you wouldn't necessarily know much at all about these people from a far off land.

 

From the perspective of someone who wants to know more about everything in Tolkien's world, I'd like to know more.

For sure.  The Easterlings, Haradrim, Variags, and the Pirates of Umbar are all very fascinating to me.  We get so little information on them in the books, other then war scenes and such.  But their culture and motives aren't mentioned at all.  And it would be so amazing to see how Tolkien imagined them in his mind.  This is also what drives me to know more about the Blue Wizards, because obviously they had something to do with the Easterlings.  And like Tolkien says, they could have fallen and become leaders of the enemy, or they could have succeeded somewhat and stopped many more foes from arriving to aid Mordor. Of course, I like to think the latter, but I guess we will never know.  

Also, if we ever get to go to the east, there would be so many scenario possibilities.  The heroes helping to stop evil Blue Wizards, helping the Blue Wizards stop the Easterlings, helping the wizards by trying to get the Dwarves from the Orocarni mountain range to help in the fight against Sauron, etc.

I think Gandalf wanted to ask for the Blue Wizards help. So one cycle could be go to the South for them, despite heroes didnt fount them. Could be a good cycle.

It is speculated (or rather more than that) that it was indeed the task of the Blue Wizzards to gather allies from the Southern and Eastern lands (especially Eastern, I believe). In which they most likely failed, and later might have even started cults (not unlike Sauron's or Saruman's).

 

Of the four mentioned above, I think we know least about the Variags of Khand.

Maybe not to gather allies. Maybe to persuade that Sauron is not that great a people should not listen to his lies and promises. Maybe without Blue Wizards attacks on Dale and Erebor and Even Gondor would have many more Easterlings. Maybe they persuaded some of the tribe leaders not to follow Sauron. Just maybe...it is how I see them.

Maybe. But I think Tolkien seemed to indicate (whether that be considered canon or not) that they have failed.

Tolkien's view on the Blue wizards changed during his life. His early writing mention that they most probably failed, but later writings color them in a more positive light:

 

Their task was to circumvent Sauron: to bring help to the few tribes of Men [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Men] that had rebelled from Melkor [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Melkor]-worship, to stir up rebellion ... and after his first fall to search out his hiding (in which they failed) and to cause [?dissension and disarray] among the dark East ... They must have had very great influence on the history of the Second Age [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Second_Age] and Third Age [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Third_Age] in weakening and disarraying the forces of East ... who would both in the Second Age and Third Age otherwise have ... outnumbered the West.
—J.R.R. Tolkien [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/J.R.R._Tolkien]

 

From Tolkien Gateway.

 

It seems they did help a bit after all. In fact a few weeks ago I was planning on creating a deluxe box for my Blue Wizards custom cards, and it was about starting a rebellion and overthrowing an evil leader of Harad and replacing him by the rightful king who was not allied to Sauron (represented by an objective ally). I had already many pieces of art and was about to design the quests but got lazy in the process. We'll probably see Harad the next cycle anyway.

Well, Harad, even Near Harad, are very eastern as well as southern Harad lies further east than Mordor, so it makes sense to group them altogether as nations of the east.

By the way, have you seen the new card in the Ettenmoors pack spoiled by COTR yesterday I think? It's pretty good.

In a silvan deck it's insane, can turn a Handmaiden into a 4 attacker or a Mirkwood Runner into a 5 attacker -defense, that's really good. And of course Celeborn, Elladan, Glorfindel and Elrond will greatly benefit.

It's badass on Elrond or Glorfindel especially on Glorfindel with his action advantage!

Wow, the card is insane. I mean so good. Mirkwood Runner really gets another meaning. With Celeborn, he strikes for 5 ignoring defense, most enemies fall against that. Haldir, similar story, with all the timing/placing bonus. insanely good. I love the Elf love we are getting.

 

Plus, you can apply it across the table, just saying.

Yes, I knew that text. As I said, it is difficult to take letters or interviews as a canon source, but it is obviously better than nothing.

A good idea about the deluxe, the designers might get inspired?

And I do rather think of them in a positive way. I think it is enough one of the Istari got corrupted. Three out of five could be a bit extensive, and not shedding the best light upon the Valar's recruitment process.

Just listened to the most recent COTR podcast and of the three cards Matthew offered to spoil for them one was a lore event that interacts with the victory display. Surely this would not have been The Door is Closed as we more or less know exactly what this does already so it SEEMS as though we will get some more cards that potentially put more non-victory points cards in the victory display and help with the Keen As Lances mechanic.

The leadership event that interacts with side quests also sounds interesting as we already have dunedain message so I wonder what this one could do...

Fair and Perilous will be a huge boost to my Lore/Spirit deck. As for upcoming cards, I would be thrilled about a new healer ally. Warden of Healing is fantastic, but I'd love something related to Noldor/Rivendell (yes I remember Lore of Imladris but I'd like something that is reusable and uses Elrond's boost). We don't have too many healing allies (though I suppose the Wellinghall Custodian might be taking up that "slot" in the foreseeable future).

The Door is Closed will be in the Treachery of Rhudaur, so yeah, that's not it. The Lore event probably was None Return, which we speculated will be an enemy version of Leave No Trace. The Leadership event was probably the Dunedain Message, as I doubt there will be 2 Leadership events that interact with side quests in the same pack. It woul've been a bummer if they had chosen that since it as already spoiled.

 

Regarding Fair and Perilous, as much as I like the card, it seems really unfair that Spirit gets an incredible attack boost while Tactics doesn't get the same for willpower. I think that if instead it was a Tactics event that added the character's attack to its willpower everyone would be screaming against the sphere bleed and how Tactics would "lose its identity". But when Spirit gets a huge combat boost, nobody seems to be upset.

The theme and art could be Boromir and Aragorn bulldozing through the snow drifts of Caradhras. They're definitely using their brute force for questing without actually battle-questing.

Not sure who you're referring to with "everyone"; I wouldn't mind more willpower boosting for Tactics in the slightest. Tactics also has a workaround for questing via Legolas+Arod, Trained for War etc. In my mind Spirit is the most essential sphere for success, and as I always end up playing support since everyone I play with prefers combat-based decks, this is exactly the kind of card I need for getting in on the action a bit as well.

I would certainly like such a card. What I'm saying is that if this card hadn't existed and instead we got the tactics version, many people would've complained. While Spirit is not the best at combat at any level, we're accustomed to seeing 3 attack Spirit heroes and 2 attack Spirit allies, while you obviously can't say the same for the analogous situation in Tactics.

Fair and Perilous is trait specific though. You need to be running Silvan or Noldor. I know most people run spirit Glorfindel but if you are running say spirit Rohan or Hobbits or something else you will not be able to utilize it.

What I am saying is that I think you are wrong because basically everyone thinks that tactics is unplayable solo and would love a quest boost. I would say we are more likely to get complaints about a spirit card making spirit OP than a tactics card making tactics playable.

Maybe you're right and people would like it. The thing is, we still got the Spirit version and that means Spirit is still keeping on "stepping on Tactics' toes" as soullos said. But I do remember that some time ago it would've happened, as people were not happy with seeing quest boosting in Tactics. It's a good thing that now more people would accept it.

The idea about attack boosting willpower for Tactics could go to Gondor or Dúnedain.

 

I hope we see more of their alliance. I love alliances. Noldor or Silvan is obvious, Hobbit or Ranger is interesting, Ranger or Scout also, Hobbit or Dwarf (mentioned), Dúnedain or Noldor (just one but more will be coming), Gondor or Rohan we've seen but Gondor or Dúnedain should be more of (though we've got Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire).

Tactics is unparalleled in combat - I don't think Spirit can rival it. In my experience, neither of these spheres is particularly viable as mono-sphere decks in solo play. In this game (and I find this good and very thematic) plurality is always rewarded - Tactics should be paired with e.g. Spirit, either in the same or another deck. But with A Good Harvest or songs, you could play StwB and ally Faramir to boost willpower even in a straight-Tactics deck.

To be fair, Tactics is my least favourite sphere and I rarely use it - but I find it fitting that brute force does not win the day on its own. It does one thing, and it does it very well. With recent cycles' cards dealing out more damage and enemies having higher attack, Tactics plays an important role that Spirit never could and vice versa.

I just wanted to add it here, you guys are so quick. Yes, None Return confirmed. They might have as well added it to the deck-list. What do you think about it? The hero line-up seems reasonable. You probably do want secrecy for the Victory strategy. Mirlonde instead of Merry is another option. Of course Merry is better to keep you in secrecy, but Spirit otherwise might have little to say in the whole strategy (get not manipulation cards, I mean). As for the deck list, I wonder why no Ithilien Lookout and Celduin Traveller? They seem fairly efficient in secrecy decks and they even help scrying.
