All my decks which i build up for solo game i build with idea to play against all quests. I dont like the idea build up certain deck against certain quest( in my opinion in this case you always have advantage against encounter deck, sound like chaeting).

But after Rhosgobel is release was quite difficult for me build this kind of deck. So now my final version of all quest beat deck (exept Dol-Guldor).

Total Cards (50)

Hero (3)
Eleanor (Core) x1
Glorfindel (Core) x1
Theodred (Core) x1

Ally (13)

Radagast (AJTR) x1
Gandalf (Core) x3
Haldir of Lorien (AJtR) x2
Henamarth Riversong (Core) x2
Longbeard Map-Maker (CatC) x2
Rivendell Minstrel (THFG) x1
Gleowine (Core) x2

Attachment (25)
A Burning Brand (CatC) x2
Ancient Mathom (AJtR) x3
Celebrian's Stone (Core) x2
Dunedain Mark (THfG) x2
Dunedain Warning (CatC) x3
Forest Snare (Core) x3
Protector of Lorien (Core) x2
Song of Wisdom (CatC) x3
Steward of Gondor (Core) x3
Unexpected Courage (Core) x2

Event (12)
A Test of Will (Core) x3
Lore of Imladris (Core) x3
Sneak Attack (Core) x3
The Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x3

This deck work quite stable and have answer for almost situations of the game.Steward, B brand and Warning you  play on Eleanor and she suppose to have Song of Wisdom.She is mostly Defernder and Cancel When revealed effect.

Marks and U courage to Glorifindel for Quest and Attack.

Stone to Theodred also mostly for quest and add resources to Glorifindel pool to heal or for map malker to quest like hell. Yes here is no Northern tracker but Map-Maker when you have enough resources give you opportunity quest quite effective.

Haldir is amazing Ally. Sure you need Gildor as well but i still wait for my Emyn Muil. Ebay is really slow this time.

Does it actually work? It seems to be very dependant on having right cards at the right time. Also some combos are not easy to pull off, especially early game (like song + brand on eleanor). I was playing similar deck and was facing the following problem: in the first turns you must choose between quest or offence. If you quest with Glorfindel/Theodred, you can't do anything against enemies. If you do not quest, the threat will kill you (you know that questing phase is mandatory and not optional, do you?)

But yeah, if you survive early turns (like 4?5?) and you have all components in play, the game should become easy. I just think this deck is very fragile before you gain control.

Why do you have one Radagast in your deck? There are no eagles/creatures.

I assume becuase his deck is meant to challenge all of the quests and Radagast is quite useful is JtR

Well, with just one in the deck its quite unlikely you'll draw it soon enough in order to have an effect on the Rhosgobel ending, whereas it's a completely dead card in all other quests...

With Protector of Lorien, there is no such thing as a dead card.

Radagast is only for Rhosgobel quest. Yes you can use him in another scenario but he is to expensive. Rhosgobel is most difficult for this deck. Even 3 Lore of Ilmadris is not enough.

Yes beginning is little bit hard but dont forget you can take lot of damage from undefended attack cose Glorfindel can heal easy after and threat level is not so big problem in beginning cose you always can reduce it later. Cannot say this deck is perfect but as a say work quite stable.

Except that Protector of Lorien can only be attached to a hero and Radaghast is an ally.

Hang on, just realised that you were referring to discarding Radaghast for Protector of Lorien's ability, not attaching it to it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] my bad. rofl :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think he meant "radagast is good" because you can discard him to protector. Rather poor argument.

 To Silverhan 77:

Listen my firend with all my respect i wont to tell  you 1 thing. Before start polemic and argue with proff player as Bohemond you must to learn subject. You must to learn the rules and have a good game experience to really understand and feel yourself like a fish in the water. Otherwise you will look like a kid who talking even dont know what he talking about. Please dont be angry nothing personally. Just let be more  reasonable. Otherwise i get feeling you not really know the game well.

Should post your Deck at The Card Game Database as cool things like deck lists will get lost in this forum as it is only for "current" discussion.. You should consider using CDB for things like deck lists.

www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/forum/19-lotr-lcg-decks/]

 

As for your deck.. I like it.. but I am not a fan of Glorfindel. Also Radagast seams a little off in this deck.. you only have a single copy so chances of pulling him are low, so you can not rely on him as engine in this deck, you just may not ever pull him at only 1 card. It is true that unlike a duel game you get a lot more time to pull as you can optionally choose to stall the game much easier than in a dueling game, but I still tend to side on the "old school" I guess opinion that engine cards need multiple copies to ensure a reliable draw.

While this deck looks like it could be fun, I think at a glance that it is to dependent on a good draw. I think you may find that your win / loss ratio isn't that good, and after a while you may be able to tell if you are going to loose after only a few turns.

Also if you are planning to make a deck to run the entire course of the Shadows of Mirkwood campaign (what most deck builders are planning to do once the last 2 are released) You will most likely need some eagles / or ranged allies... or at least a way to extend your threat reduction abilities.

Still not a bad start, just some play testing and refining here and there and this could easily end up doing what you want for this campaign set. I hope you keep at it, as yo are approaching this very different to me... as I said I have hardly touched Glorfindel. Be interested to see what you come up with

Glaurung,

In my opinion, this game has not been around long enough for anyone to be classed as proffessional (no offence to Bohemond). I have never claimed to be an authority on this game, I often get it wrong. Also what anyone else thinks of me is none of my business so I don't care if to some people I don't come across as knowing what I'm talking about. I've only been playing this game a short while but my opinion and ability to interpret the rules is just as valid as anyone else's. I'm sorry if you felt that I'm unreasonable, that is certainly not the impression I meant to give. But you can at least give me some credit for having the balls to publicly correct myself when I realised my mistake.

No offense taken.  And I am certainly no professional.  And we all make plenty of mistakes when discussing the game.  Well, at least I do ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I also should have clarified my larger point.  If you are playing with Protector of Lorien or Eowyn, you can afford to run "silver bullets" (cards that have limited general use, but are great in certain scenarios) that  not normally make you deck

So, just put this to Osgiliath, what is your actual winning percentage? What do you with the Wolves that will attack you first round due to high threat? They attack for 4 plus Snaga also attacks. Likely you shall have another enemy or a shadow effect. Also, you will quest for 4 max - you're not going to pull out anything the first round, unless you have Protector of Lorien (and empty your opening hand pretty much) or Henamarth (who can contribute 1). So your threat will rise some more. Ok, I am talking without trying it out, you tell me now. But I doubt there is actually any chance of beating Osgiliath with this deck, solo.

Side note as to being professional. I'd suggest learning what the word means before freely accusing others. Professional Lord of the RIngs the card game player? Well, who can say that? It means making a living by playing this game. I don't think the playtesters of this game could do that and I see no chance of making a living by playing it with friends, with no official tournaments around. I have been playing card games for about half of my 29 years and I think I am probably the best card game player in the universe (a jest included) but I would not call myself professional in the field.

There is also no such thing as a dead card that has 2 willpower in a solo deck. Yes, 5 resources isn't the most proficient way to get that (considering he has Haldir, Map-Maker, and a Minstrel) but he's got enough hit points to quest and survive a Necromancer's Reach, etc. if needed. I still think it's almost entirely for Rosgobel to add another card to support the Lore of Imaldris.

Actually i didn try this deck against Osgiliath. Cose i lose myOsgiliath cards as all My Lotr lcg cards. Very bad i forget my back in the taxi and lose many things.

So i buy back core sets and AP packs but Osgliath i need to order.

Yes i should try this deck against Osgiliath.Beginning i can handle it but last stage??? Will be really difficult to kill Witch-King without Gilmy, quest quickly also not so easy.

About  Radagast i need him for Rhosgobe only and with 3 lore of Ilmadris normally is enough.... Yes i can always discard him by Protector or maybe use as a quester in other scenarios  but i will replace him for Gildor when i get Emyn muil. Gildor is really good for this deck!!!

Interresting. By reading your posts I think that you rely a lot of threath control in your playing style? I think that I have underestimated that part so far...

Just peculiar. How long you can stall for nesessary until you have to push on in quest deck?

A good threat deck can get their threat to 0 and keep it near that the entire game... That's why the scoring system doesn't work. This type of deck can cycle through the entire quest deck until getting all victory points, then end the game with 0 threat giving a score well below 0.

For quest you need Map Maker and protector of lorien. If you have Stone on Theodred and u courage on Glorifindel)(after ready him for attack) you can quest with both 6.

Eleanor stand in the case to cancel some treachery or defend(warning make her defense 3 and 4). When you have enough lore resources Map maker is very powerful. He help you a lot(+1 will power for 1 lore resources) + protector of lorien as well.  So you control your will power level in the quest phase as you need. Song of wisdom on Theodred is also 1 more will power by questing to use it for Map maker or Glorifindel can heal 1 damage.

So the best situation is like this:

Eleanor : Song of wisdom+2warnings+Steward+Bbrand+Courage.

Glorifindel: 2 Marks+Courage.

Theodred: Song of Wisdom+Celebrian Stone+Protector of Lorien.

Allies: Haldir, Gildor, Map-Maker, Cleowyne.

Since there is no Northern trackers in the deck you must travel almost every turn to avoid keep many locations in the staging area.

Well Glaurung,

I have built this deck, And I've used it to play The Hunt For Gollum Adventure which is proving to be very tough. I've played it about 10 times and haven't won yet, Heck I'm having trouble getting through stage 1B. I'm finding that once you get a Hunters from Mordor and a signs of Gollum card in play, it becomes very difficult to quest successfully due to the increased threat they pose and even if you do manage to quest successfully you have to draw 3 cards from the encounter deck add one to the staging are and discard the other two, so even if you choose the least nasty one it still increased the threat in the staging area. And Unless you have Unexpected courage on Glorfindel, you can't engage because there is no way of damaging them plus you risk losing a hero when defending. I have found that you can't leave an ally ready for defending because you need them to quest otherwise your threat goes up too quickly and then the hunters engage you. I can see that this deck might work against other quests, but it has a hard time with this one, I like it though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I have sometimes, but firstly you have to take at least one hit which can result in hero loss and also they still get shadow cards dealt to them every attack phase which have to be resolved, granted not all of the have an effect but there are some that can sting.
