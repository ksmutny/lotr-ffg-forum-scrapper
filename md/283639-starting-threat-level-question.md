Hi guys,

My heroes:

Glorfindel = 5
Aragorn = 12
Refresh action: "Reduce your threat to your starting threat level."
Eowyn = 9
Setup: "Reduce your threat by 3."

Threat Level = 26

During the setup Eowyn reduces my threat by 3, then my threat at the beginning of the game is 23, if I use Aragorn' refresh action during the game what would be my starting threat level, 26 or 23?

Regards,

26. Eowyn doesn't reduce your starting threat, she just happens to reduce your threat for free at the beginning of the game.

Authraw is right! That is basically the only difference between having a 9-threat Eowyn we actually have and a 6-threat (this and The Fall of Gil-Galad)
