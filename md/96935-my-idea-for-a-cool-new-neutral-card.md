I'd have to say that neutral cards are kind of my favorite sphere/nonsphere :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

What i would really like to see are more non-istari neutral ally cards. I think a "Mercenary" ally would be really cool. It could be called something like "Northern Mercenary" or whatever  -basically just a hired sword. It would fit into almost any deck since it's neutral and could belong in any themed deck since it would just be a hired mercenary for our quest, meaning the race or faction wouldn't matter for most decks.

 

To reflect the characters poor loyalty (since it's just a hired sword) it could have a forced effect similar to Silvan Refugee for example:

 

Forced: If a character you control leaves play discard Northern Mercenary.

 

If battle starts to go ill these guys aren't going to be sticking around for long. I think this card is a pretty cool idea, at least i would love to see more neutral ally cards in the future. What do you guys think? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

What were you thinking for the stats? I want some Haradrim on our side.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] How about:

 

Mercenary Cavalry

Mercenary. Harad.

Cost 4

0 Willpower 

2 Attack

1 Defense

3 Health

 

Ranged. Sentinel. 

Response: After Mercenary Cavalry is declared an attacker against an enemy, deal 1 damage to that enemy. (trampling effect) 

 

A spendy fighter but he is a mercenary and he can be payed for by any hero.  Also, he can help across the table with his horse whether its attacking or defending.  

 

 

Hired Blade 

Mercenary. Harad.

Cost 3 

0 Willpower 

2 Attack 

2 Defense

3 Hit Points

 

Forced: After a character leaves play discard Hired Blade.

 

 

Western Merchant 

Traveler. Merchant.

Cost 3

2 Willpower

0 Attack

0 Defense

2 Hit Points

 

Action: Exhaust Western Merchant to ????????

 

 

 

Well, time will tell what goodies we will get in the future.

Some pretty good ideas you have there Khamul. 

 

I was thinking perhaps something along the lines of this:

 

Northern Mercenary (3)

Warrior. Mercenary

 

0 W

1 A

1 D

2 HP

 

Northern Mercenary gets +1 A for each encounter card in the victory display.

 

Forced: If a character you control leaves play, discard Northern Mercenary.

How about this for the merchant's ability:

Action: Exhaust Western Merchant to choose an Item attachment in your hand. Discard that attachment to add 2 resources to a hero's resource pool (3 instead if the attachment is unique and there are no copies of it in play).

This ability might inspire more use of Out of the Wild [http://www.hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/51223bd0-ffd1-11df-a976-0801209c9020]

Yeah you're right, that would be a killer combo.

Interestingly, he'd be most powerful against Hills of Emyn Muil, yet mostly useless against that quest too.

How about this?:

All good people can be friend (not only tactics sphere) with Beorn, only you need be a good boy with your friends and with the nature (by this: you must get the same sphere -also with song's help-).

But...

:angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png]  Beorn can get angry with all criature in the middle-earth, even elves, human, hobbits...!!! (he damages even your characters). Only are alive heroes, and: Gandalf and eagles (the best friends of Beorn), and some dwarfs (if they are good friends and have Hardy Leadership that increase his life)

 

 

Good combos: Gloin (to win resources) and lore sphere (Beorn is friend of the nature) healing damage

Slightly off topic: how do you create these custom cards, Mndela? That Beorn looks badass.

 

And I think mercenary allies sounds like a great idea! Like you say, they could fit any theme and sphere.

The image searching in google: 'beorn' :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] . And the template is provided by geckoTH [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/72602/geckoths-photoshop-templates]

Much obliged! I meant the template. I figured there must be a software for it, since we even saw a Santa Claus hero on here last month.

Dunedain could really fit in the neutral theme, they are wanderer that protect little people and are always ready to give a hand to everybody in danger.

Ah yes, there is a software also. But i think the templates are better (if you are speaking about lotr only). The name of the software is StrangeEons, and there is a recent post in this forum: this is the link [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/85255-design-cards-strange-eons-3-plug-in/].

Yeah - Dunedain allies would also be really cool for neutral.
