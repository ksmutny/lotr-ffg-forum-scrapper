This may get easily spoiled in all the Gandalf excitement, but it looks like Team Covenant got a spoiler from the Trouble in Tharbad pack:

Cool, but it's a shame we already knew what this card does. Still, it's good to know that she's coming in Trouble in Tharbad. Thanks for the link!

Yeah, I remember that people were piecing it together from the covered text, but it's nice to get full confirmation.

The missing part of the text was visible in the Spanish article.

I'm just disappointed with the numbers for the cost. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Think of her with all the +1's she'll get from Celeborn.

Besides the Celeborn buff, I think she's appropriately costed when compared to the Rivendell Minstrel. One resource cheaper for one less hope. You could argue about which ability is "better" but I think it would really depend on the deck she's used in.

I guess you could compare her to Master of the Forge. Same number of stats and similar ability. Minstrel's willpower could actually be used every turn vs Forge-man whose ability is used every round and the 1 defense is practically useless even if you don't use his ability.

 

In general though, regardless of ability (even with the new Silvan cards who get the boost for a turn), number of stat points = cost x 2 with a potential to have + or - 1 stat point. There are enough exceptions though, that I'm not horribly bothered by it.

Nothing will beat Erebor Hammersmith. Even the upcoming ent, because he enters play exhausted and does not brings anything back from the discard pile (while with dain, hammersmith overshadows everything).

Are we allowed to consider secrecy costs? In that case, are we comparing number of stat points above 2 x cost or we comparing stats / cost? Last one might get tricky with Rivendell Scout... :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
