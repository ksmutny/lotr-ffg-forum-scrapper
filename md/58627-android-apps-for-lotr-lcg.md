Hello everybody,

 

I recently acquired a nice smartphone that runs on Android, and I wondered if anyone knew about useful apps for the LOTR LCG.

I search a bit, but didn't find anything with google nor on BGG.

You may wonder what kind of apps could be useful to us: While playing yesterday, I tought that it would be nice to have a threat manager that can be used for several players at the same time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If you know anything like this, please share!

Thanks in advance.

No LotR apps out there that I know of.

At the BBG file section there is a app that has the turn sequence... that is the only one I know of. www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66714/turn-phase-helper-for-android [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66714/turn-phase-helper-for-android]

But it is not really any help, maybe if it had the advanced turn sequence chart from bbg or something... What I would like is a app like MTGTracker that can record threat, quest power turns and stuff

Indeed exactly what I'm looking for! Too bad nothing like this seems to exist.

 

If anybody has the appropriate computer skills to program this, please, do so :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
