Do you think Lanwyn will be any good in solo apart from her 3 attack ranged?

Lanwyn is an interesting hero. She's an ok quester, and when surge arrives she has that flexibility of evening the odds against the additional threats that are no doubt coming your way either through a questing push and/or being ready for combat. I'm intrigued.

They really missed a great opportunity by not making a seperate Gavin/falcon attachment card.

The way the article talked about it I was really surprised they didn't.

I want Brok Ironfist hero. With some type of discard action.

So,  a battle report (mild scenario spoilers if you haven't played it yet):

 

I played 2-handed with Beorn/Elladan/Damrod and Cirdan/Glorfindel(Sp)/Elrohir.  Won on the first attempt at this quest, although it was a bit iffy and it took a while. I played kind of sloppy even though I took my time (first time with this version of the these decks, chalk it up to that).  Elrohir was killed halfway through, which made defense trickier.  Cirdan with Narya was the key to winning with his multiple readyings.  The Ambush trap played a saving role a couple of times, preventing some character exhaustions by defeating a particular enemy before it could attack.  Beorn took only two hits: 2nd round from Sahir put 7 damage on him, then one hit again later on from a tentacle that put 2 more damage on him (no shadow effect, reduced from a fatal 3 damage by an Honour Guard).  Here's the kicker: I discarded TWO copies of Steward of Gondor (per Cirdan's effect in the resource phase) in the resource-starved Noldor deck after Elrohir died.  I thought I had no way to play Leadership cards, forgetting that Cirdan had a purple icon thanks to Narya.  Boy, that would have changed the flow of the game.  Won in the end, anyway.  Not such a hard scenario.  It feels like a mix between Foundations of Stone (encounter deck morphing minus the separate staging areas) and of course Watcher in the Water.

Picked up my pack and played the quest double fisted. My first time through I got called away and lost track of where I was so bagged it. I wasn't doing well though. The second time I had pretty good draws and won pretty handily. Statistically I drew an inordinate amount of tentacles, but that will happen. Decent challenge and probably rated slightly high at six. But I only have one real go at it.

I wonder how else people are going to twist the term. It's "double fisted" now. What's next? "Duo-meathunked"? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Dual-pawed, particularly for Beorn.

***SPOILER***

 

I've played this quest a couple more times now and realize how lucky I was in that win.  This is a pretty tough quest and in at least one way might be the most ingenious quest they've designed:  you can't turtle it.  Different from "Timed", this quest puts resources on out of play enemies while you are trying to build up your board.  In essence, the game is building up it's board state in hiding while you are building up yours.  Then when those enemies enter play, those resources contribute to both the enemy's strength AND the quest points of the active location.  So it's really hard to move forward and get past the enemies.  Of course there is a solution, but it is a very well designed quest and very thematic.  At the last stage where you are fighting off The Thing in the Depths I had flashbacks to 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea.

 

Bravo designers!

I like your new signature Took.

(Or has it been there for a while and I haven't seen it?)

I played through with a different couple of decks and had a more solid win.  Altogether I've only played it 3 times, but I won twice.  This time I put together a Dunedain deck that specialized in shadow cancellation (seems more important than usual in this quest), and a questing deck that supported the Dunedain deck with a few traps.

The sig is a new sig.  I agree with GrandSpleen that traps are very strong in this quest.
