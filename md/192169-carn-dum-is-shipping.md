Yes! So excited for this pack! The Long Defeat will be a great addition to my Treebeard deck (can be recycled with Hammersmith), Favor of the Valar will be awesome for any deck with Tactics Boromir, or any Tactics and/or Leadership aggro deck. And of course there's the hero. I'm praying, PRAYING for another Leadership hero with 3 willpower. The last one was Celeborn, and he isn't really good outside a Silvan focused deck. I want a new option for a splash high wp Leadership hero apart from Sam or even Balin.

SPOILER !!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

The new Hero is... Amarthiúl

 

Sphere: Leadership

Traits: Dúnedain - Ranger - Warrior

Text: (Translated from Spanish text)

"While you are engaged with at least 1 Enemy, Amarthiúl gains the resource icon Táctics. 

 While you are engaged with at least 2 Enemies, adds an additional resource to Amarthiúl resource pool when you get resources during the resourse phase."

## 9 [Seastan on October 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1869922)

Maybe this is translation issue, but does the spanish version say he gains a "printed" icon? If not, a Hama/Mablung/Armartiul thicket combo won't work.

 

Edit: Looks like thicket doesn't require printed icons so it's all good. This could be a very strong combo.

The Dunedain need to get better because they are the weakest "tribe" by far right now.  I guess it fits the Canon though.  I keep hearing Elrond's voice from the movies, "They are scattered, divided, leaderless..."  Well they have a leader, but he makes up three sevenths of the available Dunedain heroes.

 

Sparrow, can you give us a link to where you are seeing this?  TIA

I added the new hero's stats to my spreadsheet and then it downed on me how pitifully bad his hit points are.  There is only one other Leadership hero with three hit points and that's Sam.  All the rest are four or five, and this guy is supposed to be a warrior!  Hope there is a mis-print.  Is the starting threat the usual w+a+d+h?

There's no link. I own the adventure pack.

There's a tactics unique ally. It's an ent of cost 3.

Also a spirit unique noldor ally of cost 3.

Later, at home, I will be able to write better their stats and text (now i'm with my mobile)

I agree completely JC. If the transaction was made and the product in the buyer's power, they should be able to show it at will. Now regarding hero Amarthiul, first of all it's unexpected and awesome to have him, since Turch never became a player card. His ability is very good, but I think the lack of willpower really hurts the Dunedain archetype, i.e. the Secret Defenders deck this cycle was supposed to develop. For example, Rohan has Eowyn, hobbits have Sam, silvans have Galadriel and Celeborn, noldor have countless high wp heroes, etc while Dunedain have at most 2 wp heroes, which really hurts the deck for solo. And I know this is not a faction game and I could just put Sam but we still should be able to build strong solo faction drcks. And Stwb is never a guaranteed first turn play, and in current quests you just need good questing from the start. Still, he's a great combat splash hero. I do hope though that we get some kind of wp boosting attachment for the Leadership Tactics dunedain deck to work in solo.

My english is not so good to try to translate literally the text, so I will write it in spanish and someone in this forum can translate it better.

Name: Hayala

Tactics unique ally.

My guess, based on Google Tanslate:

 

"Cannot have restricted attachments. Enters play exhausted. Response: After Hayala is declared as an attacker, deal 1 damage to Hayala to deal X damage to defending enemy, where X is the amount of damage that is on Hayala."

It depends. Most of the time, it's only the When revealed effect that can be canceled, not the Surge or Doom, but we recently saw Lore cards that cancel the whole card, like The door is closed, dammed!

Amarthuils ability makes pure Dunedain decks a bit more viable. Loragorn, Amarthuil and Halbarad maybe could make a nice deck, but you will need resource generation on Loragorn to play the Lore cards much needed to Dunedain decks

I believe you can only cancel an Enemy, not any encounter card.

Like fellowshiop Frodo!   :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]  If it can cancel any encounter card, this could become a major staple card of the game... and another Lore card that makes this spehere more awesome than it already is (I LOVE mono-Lore decks in pure solo).

Cancelling an enemy makes sense. Cancelling any card would be too strong.

Cancelling an enemy it is. From https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/6/2/the-battle-of-carn-dum/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/6/2/the-battle-of-carn-dum/]

"These continue to round out the new mechanics explored within the cycle, as Leadership and Tactics players gain new Valour effects, Lore players gain an event that allows their Dúnedain or Rangers to avoid a scenario's deadliest enemies, and Spirit players gain a Noldor-themed card that plays only from the discard pile.

> Amarthuils ability makes pure Dunedain decks a bit more viable. Loragorn, Amarthuil and Halbarad maybe could make a nice deck, but you will need resource generation on Loragorn to play the Lore cards much needed to Dunedain decks

 

I'm currently using Tactagorn, Halbarad, Erkenbrand supported by a secrecy Rossiel deck. Amarthuil would be an option in place of Erkenbrand. Less shadow cancellation amd hit points, but better synergy and ressource smoothing.

 

The approach of introducing a homebrew hero over a few adventure packs is pretty cool.

I don't believe that. Just canceling any card would be indeed too strong, but you're exhausting a very specific hero to pay for this card. And then you replace it.

Yeah, agree with the above. Shuffling an enemy back with a chance of getting him again (or perhaps something worse) for 1 resource, 1 card and exhausting a hero: a very bad deal it seems. Almost as bad as Short Cut all those cycles ago.

 

Lords of the Eldar, on the other hand, seem just perfect for the Erestor deck. It is a great advantage that you can play them from the discard pile. They will be there naturally soon after you draw them. And then you get them again at the end of your deck which can be easily shuffled.

 

Lindir is cool too, though it might be harder to get rid of the cards before you play him; say you have four in your hand with Erestor, one of them being Lindir, and then it is useful to play at least one or two before  Lindir (cost 3). The timing seems the biggest issue with this type of deck but the potentials are nigh infinite (as we can see already from some of the decks).

A question about the quest mechanics of Shadow cards. If I have an enemy engaged that has a Forest Snare attached, do they still receive shadow cards. Since the shadows don't leave after combat phase, Could I have an enemy soak all the shadows and thus neuter the encounter deck since those cards will forever be attached to the enemy?

That's an exciting pack all around. Very cool! Amarthiul is a very interesting character - is he only the second hero to get an additional icon from an effect? After the dwarf, whose name I've forgotten (obviously Hirluin and Elrond, and Gandalf, but this one is unconditional on card type).

I will say about the cards that I really like the 2 new Dúnedain allies we'll get in these 2 packs, the Arnor guy and the Fornost Bowman. I can see a multiplayer (hopefully solo) deck that keeps some engaged enemies and uses Descendants of Kings to ready all these high stats allies. That looks like a pretty fun deck.

## 70 [DunedainLoreKeeper on October 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1872018)

Thanks for the info!

 

New Dúnedain hero seems exciting for a Dúnedain deck! Between Heir of Valandil and Dúnedain Hunter, you don't need a lot of resources to splash tactics-Dúnedain.

 

I was expecting the '+1 defense for each enemy engaged' and I'm curious to see how he works out.

 

I love playing trap-Dúnedain. Playing pure Dúnedain will be interesting though. you'll need to rely a lot on cheap stay-alive cards untill you get Steward of Gondor and your power allies in play. They seem better in multiplayer where you can focus on combat more. On the other hand, they seem to have this mechanic that makes them stronger the more danger there is (Descendants of Kings, Amarthíul, Heir of Valandil) so it'll be fun to see if you can build around making come-backs.

 

Don't underestimate the Elenor/Balin-for-enemies card. Especially Lore has trouble with enemies early on and would often much rather have direct damage treacheries or locations. Of course if you wiff and get another enemy, that's going to suck!

 

Playing from the discard pile is also a really cool new mechanic. I just hope it won't be too 'Noldor only' as I'd really like to expand my Caldara deck who was the queen of discard pile shenanigans before they decided Noldor should be focused on that. That's still a minor gripe I have with the game: many cool mechanics are boxed in, in predetermined traits. But Caldara, Rohan and Dwarf-mining all have discard pile synergy, so I hope we get to combine those more and not get Noldor-only cards.

> I agree completely JC. If the transaction was made and the product in the buyer's power, they should be able to show it at will. Now regarding hero Amarthiul, first of all it's unexpected and awesome to have him, since Turch never became a player card. His ability is very good, but I think the lack of willpower really hurts the Dunedain archetype, i.e. the Secret Defenders deck this cycle was supposed to develop. For example, Rohan has Eowyn, hobbits have Sam, silvans have Galadriel and Celeborn, noldor have countless high wp heroes, etc while Dunedain have at most 2 wp heroes, which really hurts the deck for solo. And I know this is not a faction game and I could just put Sam but we still should be able to build strong solo faction drcks. And Stwb is never a guaranteed first turn play, and in current quests you just need good questing from the start. Still, he's a great combat splash hero. I do hope though that we get some kind of wp boosting attachment for the Leadership Tactics dunedain deck to work in solo.

I was really hoping for a low threat cost alternative option to Sam and at 10 threat and his abilities Amarthiul is definitely a nice option but 1 willpower is definitely very troubling... if he just had 2 willpower and only 2 defense...

I've been thinking what pure Dúnedain solo could look like. Here a hypothetical first few turns.

 

Heroes: Halbarad, Marty and Aragorn (lore)

Starting threat: 32 (!)

 

Turn 1. Play Steward of Gondor on Aragorn, play a West Road Ranger. Now quest with Halbarad, Aragorn and West Road Ranger. Willpower: 5 (descent). Enemy comes down, Marty blocks.

 

Turn 2. Play Dúnedain Hunter, put another enemy into play. Either Forest Snare or Sarn Ford Sentry (2 card draw). Play Weathered Hill Watchmen. Quest with Halbarad, Aragorn, Sarn Ford Sentry. Willpower: 6 (mediocre). Enemy comes down, Marty blocks, Halbarad Blocks, Dúnedain Hunter blocks.

 

Turn 3. Here's where things get silly. Marty + Steward + Heroes = 6 resources. Add Heir of Valandil for 2-3 extra discount. Now we're getting to spend 8+ resources each turn. Sarn Ford Sentry and Weathered Hill Watchman provides more card draw, Halbarad and Marty can defend as well as the new Leadership blockers. Other Dúnedain are strong enough to block at least 1 weaker (4-) enemy to buy time. You'r ally swarm quickly grows out of control. Add a spirit song or Celebrian's stone and late game location control is save through the spirit Dúnedain. Once established, Dúnedain kick ass, that's for sure!

 

 

But, how well will it do in less favorable opening hands? Can it's high starting threat deal with the high level enemies it must immidiately engage? Maybe switch Aragorn for Pippin? Can Descendant of Kings, Ranger of Carlogan and Sneak Attack keep you alive? How dangerous are shadow cards? What are the chances of getting location-locked? Halbarad and Marty can only absorb 5 HP, will that be enough? It'll be fun to play, that's for certain.

I guess that the best way to go with Dunedain for solo right now is to cOmbine it with another trait (hobbit, Gondor, Rohan). There are not enough cards to make a viable solo deck.

Yeah, I hear you. I guess it is in the nature of a living card game, a trait being developped with cards that are released sporadically through various card packs.

The only trait that was release almost in one pack were the Outlands.

I have to say I think this is actually a rather glaring weakness of the new hero.... you can't use him while playing Wastes of Eriador, Across the Ettenmoors or Treachery of Rhudaur.... which for those who embrace the "one deck/s to rule them all" approach is rather unfortunate. Also it is just annoying because they are still fairly new and fresh and part of the current cycle so are for many players the most played quests right now.

 

I can't think of any hero that cannot be used in certain quests (excluding Saga where this sort of thing really needs to happen or quite a few quests would make no sense, Saruman or Grima fighting themselves, two copies of Aragorn in play etc) except for Faramir and now Amarthiul.

 

Also seriously what is with his 3 health...? why does he not have at least 4? He is a dunedain warrior.... not a hobbit or dwarf... dwarves only have TWO heroes with 3 hitpoints btw and every single other one has at least 4 yet this guy somehow has 3...

yep thats right hes ranked with people like Eowyn and Denethor and Caldara for hitpoints... 

 

He also has 3 defense, 3 attack and 1 willpower so is more or less built for combat yet has this high defence but awful amount of hitpoints... the 1 willpower also seems to be a massive waste of a stat..... 

A statline of 0/3/3/4 would be way better on this guy. 2/3/2/3 would be even better. Hell I'd even pay the extra single starting threat to have him be 2/3/3/3 or even 1/3/3/4. I would even prefer he be 2/2/2/4 like Halbarad as boring as that is!! That single hitpoint makes all the world of difference!

 

Struggling with this hero personally.... amazing abilities that fit right into the Dunedain theme and make Dunedain decks far more of an option now and great traits (warrior, ranger AND dunedain) but to me the absolute worst stat line ever for both what he is meant to represent and what you want to do with him (attack AND defend). Awful health yet high starting defence and no sentinel so a very awkward and below average defender. Lastlucker willpower and an attack value of 3 which is nice but can be found across a multitude of heroes most of which have additional offensive abilities. 

So he doesn't quest well, is an average and risky defender at best and is even an average attacker... 

I know I am judging this hero very harshly and he does have fantastic abilities but I had high hopes for this hero and he seems like he is all about the abilities to me :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Thanks for the illustrations DeadLord. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I'm not agree with you PsychoRocka. 3 Defense is a very good stat for a Hero!

Only 7 heroes have 3 or more defense (Beregond (4) and Dáin Ironfoot Denethor Elrond Erkenbrand Gandalf and Treebeard having 3). On a pool of 65 heroes, it's pretty cool ! And it's hard to say it's a bad defender. Even with 3 HP. I agree that 3 HP is a bit low, but i used to play Denethor as main defender, and he also has 3 def and 3 HP. It's a Dunedain, so you can play Weather Hill Watchman to retrive Dunedain Warning and have very quickly 4 Def, which is very strong. Maybe we will have a dunedain attachement that boosts the HP of a Dunedain Hero. Maybe the Lore Cloack on the Dread Realm pack...

 

3 attack is also huge ! Except for Beorn, no hero have more than 3 in attack.

 

I love the idee of helping a hero in a cycle, playing with him as an objective, and then, when you saved him, you can play him as a Hero. I find the idea very thematic, and it increase the immersion and improve the narration. For me it's not an issue that you can't play him on 3 scenarios. There are now 70 scenarios available to play. If you for example choose randomly your scenario at the beggining of a game, you can play with him 96% of the times. Otherwise, you can just swap him with Mablung for example.

 

And his abilities are so strong! Having acces to feint, to Dunedain Hunter... when 1 enemy engaged is so cool!

And the extra resource is amazing too.

I must admit Feint is the very first card I thought of with him, works very well. I hope we see some nice dunedain attachments as well, a nice weapon and a defensive attachment..

 

Also just for the record I don't believe we actually have rescued Amarthiul at any point have we? Iarion was captured and Amarthiul set out with us to rescue him.. Then during Escape from Mount Gram it is Amarthiul that sneaks into the jail and rescues/releases the initial hero rather than us saving him. Unless in treachery he gets taken captive as well..? I don't have that one yet..

At this point I would kill for something like this:

 

Unique Leadership attachment, cost 1

 

Attach to a Dúnedain hero.

Action: Exhaust [NAME] to exchange attached hero's defense and willpower until the end of the phase.

 

This would be enough to make the Dúnedain archetype so much better in solo.

What if you play alternate history where you join Amarthiúl and his TWIN BROTHER Amarthián on their quest to save Iarion? Honestly bothers me less than using Thorin or Balin in non-hobbit quests.

In that deck it is only a great, great bonus that you can only play them from the discard pile. They wait for you there, and you can recycle them easily -- to draw into them again.

I like Quick Ears a lot. Cancelling a nasty enemy (can be unique too!) can be vital for survival. I would've figured Tactics would get some form of enemy cancellation, but it's nice to see it regardless and not in Spirit. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

And I love Beechbone. Odd name, but he seems like Gondorion spearmen on steroids. High risk, high reward. hmm... he also has 2 Willpower which is nice for Tactics. Shame he's unique though.

 

Still not too keen on the Dunedain mechanic. Unless you have a reliable defender taking the hits every round or some forest snares, I don't feel the benefits of the dunedain cards of keeping enemies engaged with you is worth it. I rather clean house. Perhaps I'm just too dumb to see their worth, but they're whole shtick does clash with my playstyle and I play solo, so there's that...

Those Guardian's of Arnor do wonders for the Dunedain mechanic I think. At minimum it will have 2def 4hp when defending, which is decent. If you have two of them in play, they can pretty much hold off two smaller enemies indefinitely with their 3 def 4 hp. This enables Amarthiul's abilities and sets up powerful Heir of Valandil and Descendant of Kings uses.

 

Then if you engage a 3rd strong enemy they both have 4def 4hp and you can have one of them take the hit and deal with the smaller enemy some other way.

## 113 [Gizlivadi on November 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1876726)

From the little experience I've had with the Leadership-Tactics Dúnedain deck, I honestly could see it working if you keep a couple enemies engaged. Descendants of Kings plus Weather Hills Watchman and a bunch of signals would work fine. The problem, as I said, will be the lack of Willpower unless you run Sam, but I'm sick of playing Sam in every Leadership deck.

> At the end of the day though aren't you better off just killing the little guys the turn you engage them?

Normally yes, but when Sarn Ford Sentry draws you 4 cards or Descendants of Kings readies 3 heroes for 1 resource, it'll become more more tempting. Don't forget that if you don't try to kill your enemies, you're also saving yourself a few character actions as you don't need attackers during your first few turns. Like Silvan, Dúnedain require a different playstyle.

 

 

 

I'm also looking foreward for the quest itself, but I'm a bit dissapointed that it doesn't have an offensive siege theme. The siege quests we have so far are imo some of the best quests. It would be amazing to actually lead an army of elves and Dúnedain AGAINST an enemy stronghold. Here's hoping for the future we'll get another opportunity.

Again,  I am looking forward to the complete deck(s).  I've wanted to play Dunedain since the core, and I get that the timing paradigm is changed with the Dunedain, but unless you engage the enemies after their attack phase you are allowing them extra attacks.  Sure, you get bonuses for it, but so far I am not convinced the positives outweigh the negatives.  I really think it is more of a multi-player style.

I feel the Dunedain is not necessarily about keeping enemies engaged, but rather pulling all of them each turn.  Even though Aragorn is great, I want to use the two leadership guys and Mablung for resource acceleration.

Yeah, I saw someone playing tactics Aragorn with tactics Merry, and with a few Fast Hitch on Merry, it was quite ridiculous : you destroy an ennemy ans then engage one or two not engaged with you and destroying them in a single trun! It was in multiplayer, I haven't tried it in pure solo yet (Lore+Tactics is great, 'cause of all the healing).

## 119 [Slothgodfather on November 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1877120)

I've tried that setup with Merry and Aragorn - including a rohan horse on Merry for extra uses.  It is great on the turns where you flip nothing but enemies.  I had used Pippin also to try to get card draw and keep their threat higher.  It is a great support tactics deck, but lacks the defense typically offered by a pure tactics deck.

I'm thinking about a pure solo deck with Loragorn, Rossiel and Beregond.

Put Wingfoot and some weapons on Loragorn, have Rossiel quest with her victory pile cards, and puting a Song of Wisdom on Beregond with a Gondorian shield and a Burning brand on him, with a few readying cards for him.

 

Then a lot of card draw and fetch and a few allies.

With Loragorn you could safely include those doom events that draw or protect you from dmg.  You could even attempt to utilize the ents and neutral Treebeard since you are going lore/tactics.  Seems fun.

I don't know multiplayer, but solo is really hard. 

Thaurdir and the enemies with a lot of shadow cards attached, locations that adds battle keyword to the quest, encounter cards and effects that increase your threat quickly... There's few time to be prepared to fight againts this...

I managed to beat the quest after a side boarding. I think that a a lore heavy Elrond deck would work well here, but then it works well in most places. I'm not going to give a detailed report because it was long and brutal, probably over twenty rounds. This is the kind of masochistic quest that a certain dragon will love, and if this ever goes nightmare I will cower under my bed.

I had a very close one yesterday, 11 damage on Thaurdir but 0 progress on stage 2.  I quested hard but the encounter deck had a ridiculous round and put 6 cards on the table, a couple of them Sorcery treacheries.  So we had some extra attacks, I got 10 progress on the quest, and by the end of the combat phase I had two or three dead heroes and only 2 damage on Thaurdir.

It's a different kind of hard too... more like the old-fashioned kind of hard.  Recently, we've had scenarios like Wastes of Eriador, where it's hard but the game isn't over until round 10.  This one hits you hard and fast.. I end up forfeiting after 2 or 3 rounds, sometimes round 1.  Have had a couple of close ones that went maybe 6 or 7 rounds.

 

That said, if you can get a super defender set up, you're in very good shape with this one.  If you get Boromir or Elrohir up to 5 or 6 defense, with Arwen's sentinel, and a Burning Brand attached, you have a fighting chance.  The trouble is getting that set up before you get mauled.

It's hard.... been trying two handed, spirit/tactics hands... don't want to "spoil" much but I've tried this:

 

Spirit "questing" hand:

Sporfindel+Galadriel+Balin then I changed it to Sporfindel+Eowyn+Balin (using http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Fair-and-Perilous-AtE [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Fair-and-Perilous-AtE]but I didn't draw it!)

 

Tactics "fighting" hand:

Beregond+Theoden+Dori (Dori to help defend) then changed to swap Dori out for Beorn (5 atk)...

 

So two tries, two losses (AP pack cards in normal mode, other packs in easy mode). Might go with a Leadership hand instead (it's just not clear we'll always be in Battle questing, so maybe I'll need http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Trained-for-War-TDF [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Trained-for-War-TDF] )

This post will have spoilers for the quest.

 

My most successful strategy has been to use a mono-spirit deck with Theoden, Glorfindel, and Idraen, and pair it with Boromir (Tactics), Legolas, and Aragorn (Lore).  

 

The quest starts in Battle, so it's nice to have the three 3-attack power spirit heroes. Then, all 3 of them have some tricks to remain ready for combat, and they can help there too.  The spirit allies are willpower questers.  The deck also includes A Watchful Peace to try to slow down the number of enemies getting pumped out by the encounter deck, and Arwen to give Sentinel to Boromir.

 

The other deck usually quests on turn 1 to try to clear the active location.  It tries to set up the Song of Wisdom + Burning Brand combo for Boromir, but the most important early card is Gondorian Shield to get his defense up to 4 (5 with Arwen).  

 

The problem has been, as you may have guessed, threat.  The Boromir deck relies on Aragorn + Sneak Attack/Gandalf.  The spirit deck has some Galadhrim's Greeting.  Once set up it can handle any combat thrown its way, but getting set up is a problem.  Also, once doing a regular willpower quest, the spirit deck struggles to pump out enough willpower to keep up in the early game, and often I'm raising my threat due to questing unsuccessfully for one or two rounds.  

 

I haven't won yet, so the strategy isn't quite there.  I've considered swapping Boromir for Elrohir, but then I have to work in Elladan somehow (replace Legolas?  I hate to lose that progress), and then I also need another card to set up the combo (Steward of Gondor).  Could also put in Eowyn --maybe replacing Idraen -- to give a little bit extra willpower questing.  I usually clear that Battle keyword location with some progress to spare, so losing the turn 1 attack power is OK.  But losing the combat readiness would hurt.

In my one win I had two Dunedain Hunters in my opening hand and I played them straight away to get a couple of Orc Grunts out of the deck.

I just tried the Erestor Love of Tales deck, but I threated out on turn three. I'm not very good at that deck, but it doesn't have much attack power which leaves it vulnerable to bad starts. (I know I can use Fire to buff it up, but the table had eleven threat out on turn two.)

> I summon Seastan into this thread to solve this quest for good!

 

Unfortunately I don't own the quest yet. And since I've given it out as a possible gift idea for the upcoming holidays, I won't own it for another month or two. Just anxiously waiting for it to come out on OCTGN.

 

I'd first try my Boromir/Glorfindel/Galadriel deck. Maybe splash in a single Galadhrim's Greetings. Maybe some Dunedain Hunters if you care about getting rid of the battle keyword right away. There aren't many shadows in there that would do anything harmful to Boromir. If that doesn't work well than Erestor surely would, but you might consider it cheesy.

Erestor can be difficult to use, especially deciding what to save with the harp. Normally I keep sneak attack or Gandalf and then draw into the other on the next turn. I've managed to sneak Gandalf in 4-5 times in a single turn before, which is surely enough threat reduction. And from the sound of the quest, maybe dropping some of the Lays of Nimrodel or Dwarven Tomb for more Gondorian Fire would help.

 

Looks like a very tough quest though! Lucky for the encounter deck that getting a burining brand on Boromir is so difficult  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

So I've been using my Glory-Strider-Boromir deck and they all have three attack.  I'm still losing more than winning.

 

Regarding the Erestor deck, I'm new to it, but it can certainly brick sometimes.  I didn't come close to winning with it.

I beat it first try with my broken Gandalf/Hama feint recycle deck, but I beat everything with that so whatever. Since most people don't want boring OP Gandalf hero, I suggest a deck built around.... Derdingle warrior. I am not joking. The quest really requires strong defenders, especially when Thandie makes his sudden Champion attacks. It turns out ol Derdingle is probably the single best defending non unique ally in the game. If you back him up with some Wardens of Healing he is basically unkillable, then ready with Treebeard and your goo to go.

Using that Stat I had the most success and it was the first time I actually felt like ent were OP. Derdingle is really good.

I seriously came over to these community forums to rant in a new thread, but I will calm down and post here instead.

 

I wanted to create a thread with title "Can we have some limits please?"... and by that I mean stuff to calm the encounter deck down sometimes! If the encounter deck were a player... we'd all be crying how broken it was and errata'ing everything.

 

In this quest, in particular, they kinda forgot to "chill" some things out. Did they consider how insane things will stack? Seriously, what fun is it to lose a game because I had snared/spiked some enemies then stage 2a goes (surprise to me) "raise theat by... oh... just by eleven." ha. ha.

 

Another game, I seriously channel Oprah thinking "have a shadow! you too! another one!"... then I go and flip an enemy... ends up in an 11 point attack. And who thought Orc Ambush deserved "Each player must go fetch an orc" !? How about IF THE PLAYERS AREN'T ALREADY SWAMPED WITH ORCS?

 

I just wish the EP had more "if you aren't f*ed". Kinda how I hate surge when it ends up putting more than 2x player count... or enemies that don't deserve an eleven attack swing getting one... how strong is goddam mordor!?

 

Yeah, I'm :-( right now. and I have > 200 plays, so I'm a fan. But FFG, please... win by clever tricks not just by sheer runaway power...

 

I actually just tried a two-hand all-tactics deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ... it was doing okayish until Orc Ambush. I might just try again. My sixth or so try... I want all spirit. And all lore. And all tactics... and a leadership ally swarm... all at once.

Played this one today for the first time. Threated out as expected based on what I've read.

I will say, while the scenario is tough, I didn't see any game ending treacheries or shadows. It's the kind of challenge that feels beatable which I appreciate. Not saying I will win anytime soon though!

> Bummed about the Lords of Eldar. Needs to be in your discard pile, buffs speicif, rare, trait and still costs 3. 

 

Old comment but I 100% agree. Really underwhelmed by it right now. 

 

Compared to a card like Lure of Moria (a 3 cost event targeting all characters of a specific trait with a generically useful effect) it seems similarly useful. But when you really dig into it it's SO much more limited!

 

You have to find it in your discard pile, you need 3 spirit resources (harder to find than 3 Leadership resources most of the time) and in most cases all it will do is give each character a +1 to whatever they're doing. Additional readying effects HELP, of course, but in exchange you lose the utility of setting up effects like We Are Not Idle and A Very Good Tale.

 

Great if you're running Erestor or Cirdan. Okay if you're running a heavy Protector of Lorien strategy or Eowyn with a bunch of Noldor. But otherwise...just doesn't seem worth it.

Hard quest :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

My actual decks were beaten without a real chance of success.

The main problems to resolve for this quest :

- Threat : It increase quickly (due to encounter card effect or quest fail). So massive threat decrease is needed.
- Massive Shadow card & Strong Shadow effect : Boromir with a Gondorian Shield & Arwen capacity has been killed many times with only one attack. I have seen some attacks with 5 shadow cards.
For this point, i think that we have three strong solution : Hama with Feint or Burning Brand with a strong defender or Chump Blocker with some Hasty stroke for the powerfull shadow effect which target the player board.

On my first attempt, i have rushed the active location which give battle keyword => Some result each time : Defeat.

So, i have decided to not rush the active location, clean ennemies, prepare my board, accept quest fail and use massive threat decrease in order to manage quest fail & encounter effect.

First attempt with my old Dwarf deck (Dain/Grima/Nori), win on the first try.
Nori manage the threat.
Dwarf ally + Hasty stroke used for ennemy attacks. I have never used Dain for defense too risky.
Dain give bonus for questing (battle or normal)

Second attempt with a Hama deck like DukeWellington (Gandalf/Glorfindel II/Hama but different in the deck content), win on the first try.
Massive Threat decrease (Galadhrim's Greeting, Elrond Counsel reused with Dwarven tomb). I have played Galadhrim's Greeting two times, Elrond Counsel five times and finished with threat at 38.
Hama + Feint used for enemy attacks and so no shadow effect.
Ethir swordsman, Knight of the swan, Dunedain Hunter and Ready effect for Heroes for questing.

For the two attempts, no rush on the active location.

I have always kept a Chump blocker for unexpected Thaurdir attacks during questing phase.
The battle was hard but so amazing :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I'm only about five minutes in to the Boromir game. You had an incredible flop with both Shield and Valinor, but I've still lost with that. You forgot to surge on the first card which would have put an extra three threat in the staging area for +2 threat instead of 2 progress and then...

Yeah the Boromir deck was the first deck I tried against the quest and it took me a while to get used to all the effects, so there are a couple errors. Thanks for pointing out the surge.

I've tried several different decks, starting with a pair of dwarf decks that I had previously been using (Dain/Nori/Thorin and Gimli/Ori/Bombur).  Mostly however my strategy has been to set up a super defender with readying, high defense, and Burning Brand.  I've tried with Elrohir and Boromir but it takes too long to set up in most cases.  The companion deck quests.  I had chosen spirit heroes with 3 attack power to deal with battle questing, so I had mono-spirit with Theoden/Glorfindel/Idraen, who were also good because each of them has easy access to some readying effect that allows them to participate in combat as well.

 

To speed up access to Burning Brand, I tried converting the quest deck into an Erestor deck, just swapping Idraen for Erestor and changing the deck composition somewhat.  That worked a little better, but still it seems my best efforts match the encounter deck if I'm lucky.  I had several tries with Elladan/Elrohir/Boromir, letting Boromir take the early defense and abusing his ability, setting up Elrohir as the super defender and then switching to him once he's established, so I can stop raising my threat.  Also tried using Lore Aragorn for threat management.

 

The other day I tried doing an ally swarm deck for the quest deck, with Sword that was Broken, Faramir, and Visionary Leadership all in the deck.  That is what I currently have built.  But I haven't been able to get established quickly enough, or end up needing to chump block with those all-important allies.  It uses Lore Aragorn, Imrahil, and Thorin (mostly chosen for stats rather than abilites).  Had Sam in there, but kept failing the early battle quests and swapped him for Imrahil.  The other deck currently has Boromir/Galadriel/Bard.  Bard's ability is underutilized because the other deck doesn't like to engage enemies, and it's harder to get sentinel on Boromir (I use Arwen but Galadriel and Arwen don't get along).

I was wondering recently if Eleanor would prevent Thaurdirs effect from sorcery cards, since she discards the card. If so she could be useful in multiplayer when you are getting a sorcery every round.

I need to make this clear to any who might be new to the forums: Seastan is a great player and an even better deck builder. This quest has a lot of intricate interactions that are easy to miss. Now...

I have been playing that if a Treachery card was revealed - even if I cancel the when revealed effect with A Test of Will - Thaudir gets a Shadow card. You played it differently. Also, it looked almost like you were playing core Gandalf as a sort of Hobbit/core Gandalf hybrid. I was a few cups in, but I swear you committed him to the quest without exhausting a few times.

Still, I love your decks. Gondorian Fire and Blood of Numenor need the ban hammer.

Edit: Galadriel. Forgot about that ability.

Eleanor discards the treachery, but the only thing she cancels are the 'when revealed' effects.  Thaurdir gets plenty of sorcery.

Thanks for the compliment. I do play it the same as you do, triggering Thaurdir with Test of Will. I just misplayed it at the 23 min mark in the Boromir video. Of course, at that point an extra attack from Thaurdir would have been no big deal, but a mistake is a mistake.

 

I am testing out a version of the Boromir deck with Silver Harp and Brand. Maybe I will give the quest another shot and try to beat it mistake-free.

So I have played through it a few times now. I still don't quite have the hang of it, but I just wanted to share my thoughts.

 

I love the quest. I think the designers have done a very good job on this one. It's very tough, and it was obviously the intention of the designers to release a difficult quest, so this should not count against it. Even more impressive is that it does not feel unfair, in the sense that nightmare Dol Guldur, Return to Mirkwood, and Amon Din are hard because they are unfair. Possibly because in other quests you can be hit by an unlucky shadow card out of the blue and feel cheated from victory, but here in Carn Dum that is the regular, and you are expected to be ready for it, but also because there are no truly devastating cards, just a very high average card difficulty. 

 

This quest certainly inspires deckbuilding, but at the same time doesn't present an easy solution, apart from maybe Hama-Feint, although that strategy is weaker in multiplayer. It seems as if this quest was rigorously playtested, and when someone came up with an idea to beat the quest, they added in some card or effect to hurt it. There have been a few times where I thought I had sealed victory going into the second stage only to remember the Champion's -10 engagement effect too late and I die in a swarm of enemies.

 

I have found Loragorn-Frodo-Spirfindel to work pretty well, and doesn't feel as cheesy to me as Hama or Love of Tales. There is also a mono-spirit deck I'm working on that uses West Road Traveller to get rid of the battle and Shadows Give Way to stop shadows, but it still needs work. I look forward to getting in some 2-attempts as well soon.

## 169 [GrandSpleen on November 21, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1902538)

Whew!  I finally had a 2-handed win against this quest tonight.  I had Boromir (Tactics), Legolas, Gandalf,and on the other side Aragorn (Lore), Thorin, and Imrahil.  

 

Victory came because I drew into my 'defensive suite' in my opening hand (Gondorian Shield, Arwen, Song of Wisdom, Burning Brand).  An early Herald of Anorien from the Aragorn deck got Arwen into play early, and by turn 2 Boromir was set up (5 defense, sentinel).  Later got a Warden of Healing to let him keep defending even though Thaurdir was chipping away.

 

The other deck took awhile to heat up, but eventually got Faramir and Sword that was Broken on the table, and a nice little swarm of allies so it could quest for 20+ (a little over 30 on the final round).  It never drew Steward, but it got King Under the Mountain pretty early, which was necessary because it helped me set up A Good Harvest + Desperate Alliance to allow the Boromir deck to continue functioning.  

 

Gandalf was helpful for accelerating the draw of the tactics deck (by letting me play the top card of the deck), but otherwise none of his toys came out.  On the final round, I quested through stage 2 in one go, took 2 hits from Thaurdir and one from a Werewolf, and then Boromir, Legolas with a Rivendell Blade, Gandalf, and a Vassal of the Windlord got 10 damage onto Thaurdir for the win.

 

Happy to be done with that epic string of losses... definitely was more challenged by this quest than any before, but it was never frustrating like Nin in Eilph or some of the other wonky ones.  It's a cool quest, but doubt I'll be revisiting it anytime soon!

I was thinking along the same lines with both players built around setting up Boromir. I think it's easier to get the brand onto him that way. Trying to cram all those cards into one deck is really tough.

Getting the Shield and the Brand on Boromir is still no guarantee though.  Your threat can spiral quickly.  The quest attacks you from a lot of different angles.

Played this a few times now and it angers me. I love the theme and the location of Carn Dum, but I'm not a fan of the quest sadly. I've already come to expect to see really hard quests but this is insanely frustrating to me. Sure, there's no brutal instant scoop when revealeds or shadow effects (I kinda disagree with that though), but when you start with 5 in the staging area and an active location that gives battle to the current quest, yeah, there's like 2 deck that can deal with that. (Talking about solo of course). I just built a mono-Leadership w/Tactics Dunedain deck with lots of Dunedain allies and insane action advantage (core Aragorn, Halbarad, Strength of Arms, Descendants of Kings, etc) and obviously got crushed. Way to encourage the new archetypes of the cycle. At least in Into Ithilien the southrons didn't take 8 to kill and you had objectives allies, and it's still difficult. This one requires one or two very specific decks to beat, and that is no fun to me.

On hand I agree with you Gizlivadi. I am not a great fan of super hard quests because then you are often forced to one of few decks to beat it, and many decent decks are overrun without much of a chance.

But I also think you have been a bit stubborn with your deck–building, judging by our previous discussion. The mono Gondor deck you showed wasn't going to win much, I thought. I wasn't going to argue about it on and on but I this is now the second quest in a row where you post your frustration. Maybe it is time to give cards like Reinforcements a chance to shine, haha. (On a more serious note, I doubt the card itself can change much here but it is still playing wonders for me).

yeah..  so far I've been getting smashed too.  I really hate the "battle" keyword and I had hoped we were done with it.   Apparently not.  It makes willpower characters (like Eowyn, many allies) pointless.   I don't know what the logic was behind so heavily emphasizing the attack stat.  It would be like if all of a sudden you had to both quest and fight at the same time with Willpower, but we haven't seen that, yet Battle is quite common. 

One of my main problems with this quest so far is just making it through the first active location.  I'm no slouch for attack power on heroes, but you pop out a 4 threat location and even treachery cards are adding threat to the staging area...  it's not pretty.  

Beyond that, same problems as everyone else.   Blocking with an ally means your ally is almost certainly dead,  and if you hit the shadow card that discards them if there is a copy of them in your discard pile then you lose a hero as well.   Blocking with a strong defender hero usually works... right up until it doesn't.  After your hero gets one-shotted by double shadow +1 for every ally you control or something like that, you're done.

I think Battle is rare, it's common in the cycle that it was introduced in, but there are only a small handful of quests that use it outside of Heirs of Numenor/Against the Shadow.  We have actually seen fighting with willpower a couple of times, actually-- once in the Druadan Forest and once in The Stone of Erech.. maybe more, but I can't recall any.  

 

There are some cards that work wonders in this quest.  Steed of Imladris is one of the best.  Any then any others that can progress to the active location, such as Arod, Gondolin Blade, and Legolas work well too.  For awhile I tried to forego "beating" the willpower of the encounter deck, and just sought to "match" it, using Legolas and Gondolin Blades to actually progress in the scenario.  This was not so practical... but it did clear a lot of active locations :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

don't have Stone so didn't know about that one.   I do recall the part in Druadan forest but that is only stage 3 of Druadan and Stage 3 has Siege.   Which means your willpower characters aren't pulling double-duty, so it's quite a bit different.   Rather this is a corner-case of defenders pulling double-duty, being relied on to quest and defend, and at the expense of attacker characters rather than at the expense of Willpower characters like it usually is.  I don't like siege keyword either for exactly the same reason.

It's not even that common in Against the Shadow - one stage of Blood of Gondor and one location in Assault on Osgiliath and that's it. It's just that the deluxe has it pop up in all three quests.

Before this thread becomes even more off-topic, I would like to add my opinion on the quest itself.

 

At first, I was very excited about the level of difficulty. After three quests that were not much of a challenge for solo play (in my opinion at least), it seemed like the Battle of Carn-Dum finally was a quest again that I would not complain about. After this initial impression, I banged my head against it quite a few times with a variety of decks that I usually find fun to play. Like others in this thread, I slowly got the feeling that this quest is unfair and that the encounter deck just has too many tricks up it sleeves. In the past couple of days, I eventually took the time to analyse my defeats in more detail (then became frustrated in between) and finally fine-tuned my deck, so that I can be victorious without feeling too lucky about it.

 

My final verdict on this quest is that it is really great. For the first time since the Nin-in-Eilph, I feel like I was challenged as a deckbuilder and solo player. I am sure the Glaurungs among us dearly appreciate quests like this.

 

On a final note, I did not really plan to come up with a somewhat thematic deck for this quest but I incidentally ended up with Elves and Dunedain: Elrond (solid defender with a Burning Brand, plus extra healing), Loragorn (desperately needed to cope with threat), and Glorfindel (Light of Valinor and Asfalaloth are too useful in this quest to pass on). If people are interested, I will be happy to write up the complete deck and a strategy guide within the next days/weeks. Until then, I hope others (except Seastan, who probably is done with it already) enjoy the challenge as much as I did. =)

I cant remember the last quest i didnt beat on the first or second try. But after about a dozen games with various decks, ive not managed to beat this yet. Now its getting frustrating. Had an epic rohirrim riding down the staging area moment earlier where they swept the board (bar the captain), only to lose to chained surge and multiple attacks from the champion in the next round.

## 185 [Seastan on November 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1911226)

I tried Rohan as well and it was a mess. I just don't think they're the right ones for this. I think the trick is serious action advantage and a beefed up defender.

 

I got really close with Ents but some additional-attack shadows hit me on the last round.

 

So far what has worked for me:

1. Boromir

2. Erestor/Bilbo

3. Gandalf/Elrond

4. Loragorn/Frodo

5. A Very Good Tale

 

What has not worked for me:

1. Silvan

2. Rohan

3. Gondor

4. Ents (Close)

 

I recommend that more people try Loragorn/Frodo/Spirfindel. It's perfect for this quest because you have high starting attack, high midgame willpower, access to Asfaloth and Brand, great threat reduction, and Frodo can defend Thaudir's attacks in both the quest stage and combat stage.

## 186 [CaffeineAddict on November 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1911352)

I was using two handed rohan, with hama, eomer and erkenbrand on one side, and theoden,eowyn and erestor on the other. Erestor was there to fuel eowyn and bring a constant supply of rohan allies and plenty of mounts (he even brought some steeds from imladris to help out), along with access to some healing for Erkenbrand. Erkenbrand was acting as my defender, with some attachments to beef him up. I used forth eorlingas/charge of the rohirrim/rohan to warhorse to kill loadd of enemies in the staging area while their engagement cost was boosted.

Overall, it may not have won, but it came closer than many of my other attempts.

But i might try out that hero lineup instead.

I had a deck with Halbarad / Loragorn / Mablung + Ents which got me three wins (out of 15 or so). The deck is based on Seastan's Super Bilbo deck, as it contains all these wonderful doomed cards for card draw and resource generation. However, if you draw too many sorcery cards in the beginning, you have no chancw with any deck, I suppose. I agree with those who don't like the quest design. Apparently you can only win when the encounter deck lets you. It still is very satisfying when you do win or loose closely.

 

Lore/leadership seems to be a good combo for this scenario. All the other decks I built afterwards failed horribly, tactics surprisingly does not work as good as one would think it would in such a combat heavy quest.

## 188 [leptokurt on November 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1911719)

Ok, I switched Mablung with lore Glorfindel (after a massive streak of quick defeats). This deck seems to work better, at least I can get to stage 2 from while to while. Two times I got my victory snatched away just before the end (hey, what can go wrong if I defend one single attack without Burning Brand? - Ooops...), but eventually I got one victory under my belt.

 

And I learned to suffer. A lot.

 

(glad my neighbours didn't call the police when I was yelling at the encounter deck and loudly cursing the designers for not play testing their scenarios for solo play).

 

You know who is really cool to overcome that location at the beginning? Mirkwood Woodsman and Quickbeam.

Oh shiiiiiiiit! :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

 

I thought it might be easier if one player cares for combat and the other one does the heavy questing. As a solo player, I feel I am always at the short end of the stick in this scenario.

 

Apparently I was wrong! May god bless all of you multi players... :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

It has a lot of combo potential, the darn thing.  It broke my mind for a little while until I finally lucked out, the cards came out in just the right order, the planets were in proper alignment, my voodoo charms took effect, and I got a win.

 

Since the encounter deck is literally 50% enemies, you can't really go the traditional route of one deck quests and one deck does combat.  Everybody gotta fight.

I came close to beating this quest over the weekend with the Leadagorn, Boromir and Erestor deck paired with a Beregond, Hama, Bard deck.  I was able to take card of questing and leave a guy or three up for healing, defending as needed.  We were into the last turn, did the math and would be able to win it - after sacrificing the tactics player to the swarm of enemies on him - and I had enough guys to deal the final damage to the boss.  Unfortunately, he go the shadow card that made him attack an additional time, which killed another guy, leaving the boss 2 HP away from dying.  If it wasn't that one or the one that discards the defending character, we would have pulled it off.

Tried twice my Loragorn, Beravor, Halbarad deck ... no need to write about it, painfull

 

Then for the fun I decided to try a pure Tactics deck I like, Hama, Eomer, Beregond. Had only one game but did surprisingly well, managed to get through the first quest card and lost on the second out of a bad shadow card which destroyed Beregond (my enemy was getting +1 for each ally I had and I had 10 in play ) thus I decided to dump the game

 

If I manage to find a way to deal with shadow cards better, I might stand a chance here  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

My conclusion is that this is possibly one of the most awful designed quests ever. I ask myself if they still playtest their scenarios at all. Sure, it's satisying when you win, but so far I was 95 percent frustrated when I was playing. My wins were purely based on lucky card draws, but there are so many cards in the encounter deck that kill you instantly that it is almost impossible to make it through stage 1 alone.

 

When I play I want to have fun. I have no fun when I am playing Carn Dum. I wish I could get my money back.

I have seen at least 8 or 9 (and counting) completely different solo deck archetypes that have a decent shot at beating the quest. I think once you learn what works and what doesn't, the quest becomes much less frustrating.

I don't see how it is fundamentally different from having a really bad match up in a versus game.  When that happens you are basically praying that the opponent draws poorly.  If he doesn't, you lose.  It's a card game.  I'm enjoying the challenge.

Having read your guys posts before trying this quest, my friend and I were adequately warned about the difficulty of this quest.  Unlike the Wolf surge quest from earlier in the cycle - we were completely unprepared for that train wreck.   I think knowing it was going to be damned difficult to start helped our opinion of the quest and have found the challenge to be great.  I typically like to build a few "power" decks that I can use against anything, but this one definitely will require some more tweaking than usual.   Shadow cancel seems to be more important than Treachery cancels honestly, so Balin will likely make an appearance in my next attempt.

This quest is insanely brutal. I am about 6 losses in so far (I think? Maybe more?) and do not imagine my decks will be beating it any time soon. 

I think this quest is easily far harder than Lake Town, Dol Guldur, Morgul Vale or Nin-in-Eilph.

Insane amount of threat gain? Check. A Boss enemy that can easily make multiple attacks a turn and starts the game off in staging? Check. Awful Treacheries? Check. Awful enemies? Check. Some downright nightmare location cards? Check. 

Some of the worst side quests ever? (Orc Ambush and Furious Charge are both horrid!) Check!

 

Right when you think you have things under control something awful happens and you are just screwed. The champion side of Thaurdir is just retarded, -10 engagement cost to all other enemies? Yeah great so even when you stave off his attacks, keep locations under control and have managed to control enemies fairly well by keeping half of them in staging Thaurdir is flipped and all of a sudden every enemy in play is engaging someone! Just the nasty extra attack really wasn't enough and they had to add this -10 engagement to the champion side as well? Overkill.....

Carn Dum Garrison is simply too strong... 3 armour AND five hitpoints? and you start with 2 of them and are bound to have a third appear within a few turns? Crazy. Even the weak enemy, the Orc Grunts or whatever, have surge so they usually surge into some 4 threat location, another enemy or a goddamn sorcery treachery...... they are honestly just as bad as any of the other horrible cards in this quest purely because of surge and the potential to get something so nasty from that surge effect. Oh and they have doomed 1 because there isn't already enough threat gain in this quest..

Another thing I have noticed is that literally EVERY SINGLE TREACHERY in this quest except for Daechanar's Will which goddamn it, Flips Thaurdir ANYWAY has the sorcery trait...... this is stupid.... only half of them should have this.... essentially every single treachery in the quest does whatever it does on its own AND then deals a shadow card to every single enemy in play OR allows Thaurdir to make an instant attack. Well actually to be honest they do both because even if they trigger the shadow cards effect this is just helping Thaurdir get to 3 shadow cards which then makes him flip and get an extra attack!!!
This is way too nuts... 

 

Some of the shadow effects in this quest are crazy as well and you BETTER NOT be chump blocking or it will be game over VERY quickly but at the same time you do not have ANYWHERE near enough time to set up a super defender considering you could be facing multiple attacks of 5 or 6 attack strength on the first or second turn and the attacks only get worse as the turns go on. 

 

Honestly most games I was not even able to make it past Accursed Battlefield.... the starting location......

the amount of threat in staging while you are battle questing on the first few turns is just stupid. 

4 from Thaurdir, 4 from the two Carn dum Garrisons because a treachery was revealed and then like 2 to 4 from a location or nasty enemy  so like 10 to 12 first turn (two handed/two player) which would not be so bad if you weren't battle questing and trying to keep back enough characters to at least kill one carn dum garrison considering a werewolf or some other enemy was probably revealed during staging first turn and if not one will definitely appear during the second round and you will get quickly overwhelmed.

How is this meant to be possible except with the most powerful or most tailor made decks?

 

One particular attempt I double sneak attacked gandalf into play first turn each time doing 4 damage to a carn dum garrison and then was able to finish BOTH off with attacks during the first combat phase. Both Carn Dum Garrisons down and a great start. I also had fantastic other cards and a great hand with the other deck. Pretty sure I conceded on the fourth turn in this game as the encounter deck just INSTANTLY turned my great start into absolutely nothing by just pumping out multiple enemies, multiple locations and multiple attacks from Thaurdir being flipped back and forth and stacking up shadow cards. 

 

I have to say I am leaning towards agreeing with those who think this quest is too hard and badly designed. I know I am in a small minority but I do not deck build for each quest and am massively a part of the 2 decks to rule them all camp. 
I know that a big part of the game is deck building for quests to find the best way to beat them easily and on a regular basis and to "solve the puzzle" but I feel like the designers have done a really good job of balancing the game to a point where you need to deck build for quests UNLESS you have a really powerful all rounder deck that might not stand as much of a chance as a deck tailor made for the quest but you still have a pretty good chance. Even quests like Dol Guldur, Morgul Vale etc can be beaten with a powerful deck that is not built specifically for the quest so long as you persevere or get lucky or have an especially skillful and combotastic game and just manage to pull it off. This is great and means people that like to deck build for quests and people that like to use the same decks consistently are both catered to and can both have fun with their playstyle.
I feel like this quest does not allow this and you have to be using a seriously mega powerful/broken deck/s or ones that are built specifically for this scenario to stand any sort of chance. I have beaten every quest to date and quite a few of the nightmare quests (up to midway through dwarrowdelf) including Dol Guldur, Morgul Vale, Five Armies and even Ruins of Belegost (with some insane luck!) with more or less the same decks but this quest just laughs at me and spits in my face  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

This has me worried the game is moving more in a direction (especially with powercreep and everything) where deck building for quests may become something that is not quite as optional and you might not be able to grind out a win without doing so....

If this really happens it will no longer be a game that is for me. Don't have time to build a new deck from scratch every time I want to play a new quest, just not interested whatsoever. Really hope this is not the case and we continue to see quests that can be beaten with a wide variety of decks. If they want to make quests you HAVE to deck build for they can do that in nightmare... (if they really have to haha). 

 

I guess 6 or so games isn't really enough to make a judgement so I will stick with it and continue to try and grind out a win but I really don't see it happening.

 

I think the main issue is just how quickly it all happens in this quest, even shadow and flame gives you a breather round before its onslaught, deadmans dike starts off brutal but can taper off quite often if enemies slow down etc, once you rescue the captive in dol guldur it gets much easier. In this quest it is hard and fast from the first round to the last round with the potential for game ending treacheries, multiple boss attacks and chain shadow effects on lowly enemies resulting in dead heroes every single turn. Most turns in fact you will have a combination of these things. If you consistently lost on stage 2 or further into the quest it wouldn't be so bad but knowing that you've already lost just a few turns in and having to concede and re set up from scratch is mega frustrating. 

 

Probably the second biggest issue is the diversity and amount of things the encounter deck can throw at you in this quest. It has:
-Shadow cards that give extra attacks.

-Shadow cards that make you discard player cards

-Shadow cards that can discard cards from your player deck!!!

-Shadow cards that chain together or can give like +5 attack. (+1 for each shadow card dealt, +1 for each ally defending player controls)

-A location that turns shadow cards with no effect into "raise your threat by 2"....

-Enemies that attack out of the combat phase (Thaurdir and the werewolf) 

-A Location that heals enemies EVERY TIME they make an attack....

-Encounter deck direct damage (vile affliction) 

-Battle keyword on accursed battlefield because there wasn't already enough horrible effects

-A location that raises your threat for every single resource you spend

-The treachery that makes you discard a random card and then search for deck for each other copy of that card and discard them too, imagine this effect making you get rid of every test of will, every hasty stroke, every burning brand, every gandalf....

-Orc Ambush because you know you weren't being overwhelmed or ambushed enough apparently. 

-Heavy Curse making all your player cards cost more if there is a copy already in your discard pile

-Orc Grunts shadow effect is just awful, there are already way too many enemies in this quest and so many so quickly that getting this shadow card early on even if it does help you avoid surge is just brutal. the slowing of progress effect is also pretty nasty, especially if you have multiple copies in play... 

 

Like honestly does the encounter deck want to have any more abilities? It feels like it has a more diverse range of abilities than we do as players!!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

That's what I thought when reading that, too.  I don't think "too hard" and "bad design" are synonyms... Carn Dum is a good example in my opinion.  I do believe this is the hardest quest yet released, but I don't see anything wrong with the design of it.

 

This is the second quest to ever receive an "8" difficulty rating (highest rating they have ever assigned), with Shadow and Flame being the only other one.  The difficulty ratings they give out have often been almost nonsensical, but at least we know they were aiming to make this one as hard as possible.  So I don't think we should expect quests of this challenge level to be the new trend.

Rocka just explained very detailed why this quest is badly designed. Although he forgot to mention that sorcery card that surges (mostly in another sorcery card :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] )and that treachery (Daechanar's will) that means in 95 percent of the cases "game over".

 

This quest is hard because it is unfair. Some folks who spent their whole time with deck building and who like to use broken cards (and who have two core sets, that is) might find this one charming, but guys like me who like to use the whole card pool and perhaps some of the new cards not so. I share Rocka's concern that quests like this might become standard. I fear that this game is indeed going to die if we get two or three of these in a row.

 

I have no problem to loose, but if I loose constantly due to one single attack that I had to defend without Burning Brand after 10 minutes of play, I feel frustrated and angry. What the encounter cards lacks IMO is an option to choose between two evil things. Example: "Switch Thaurdir to his game over side or discard three cards/kill an ally/raise your threat/don't touch your girlfriend for three days"). It's also hilarious that we always had Amarthiul at our side, but in this brutal scenario he suddenly chose to disappear.

Very fair statement. There is a big difference between difficult and completely impossible unless you are using a specific type of deck however! 

 

There is also a big difference between losses that are halfway through a game and just conceding like 2 to 3 turns in constantly because its already unbeatable at that point.

As a thought experiment then, what would a quest look like that is equal in difficulty to Carn Dum and yet fair/well-designed?

Some folks who spent their whole time with deck building and who like to use broken cards (and who have two core sets, that is) might find this one charming, but guys like me who like to use the whole card pool and perhaps some of the new cards not so. I share Rocka's concern that quests like this might become standard. I fear that this game is indeed going to die if we get two or three of these in a row.

What the encounter cards lacks IMO is an option to choose between two evil things.

It's also hilarious that we always had Amarthiul at our side, but in this brutal scenario he suddenly chose to disappear.

Yeah if there is another quest this hard within the next few quests we get I will have to seriously reconsider this game and I play nightmare quests from time to time...

Everyone seems to be well aware of the fact that we are not really getting much powercreep with our player cards anymore (except perhaps ents but that bandwagon is slowing down and I think people are realizing how detrimental the turn of waiting can be in so many quests) and instead they are filling in gaps in certain traits and expanding our abilities and cardpool and even deck types (Erestor deck, victory display deck, dunedain keep enemies engaged decks are all new in this cycle) outwards so we can pull off new and fun combos and do things we haven't been able to do before (victory display manipulation, erestors game changing ability, valour, attaching a card to your threat dial, attaching player cards to quest cards, player side quests etc) but the encounter decks and quests are still getting more powerful...

 

When we now get "hard" quests they are twice as hard as the quests we used to get that were "hard" but the "great" player cards we now get are mostly great because they are strange and new not because they are necessarily powerful. Many instead have a nuanced power you need to build around or use correctly (door is closed etc) which is actually really cool but if we are going to get quests like carn dum I'd honestly rather some player cards that are more powerful and less nuanced to help us out.

I nearly had my first success ... it was a bad decision I made that cost me the game

 

I tries a Loragorn, Treebeard Merry (tac) ent deck, and on first attempt I needed just one more progress token on stage two, in order to reach 15 and attack Thaurdir (I had an attack strength of 20 or something, so he would be dead meat)

 

With threat at 47 I draw the enemy that either draws another card or I discard one ally, I could discard with ease, and here is my mistake, I did not, I draw another and is the enemy with 8 threat, doom 1 and surge ... I draw his surge and it is another copy of the same enemy, and then a location of 3 ... thus I place only 1 progress on the 2 quest card instead the 2 tokens I needed (cause it ended up that threat in staging area came 7 more than I thought, and out of fear this might happened I quested with more than needed but not that more) , thus I could not attack Thaurdir to kill him and at the end of the refresh phase I was threated out ... if I had discarded an ally (warden of healing would be) then I would have won ...

 

Had a great time anyway, very tense, I will change my deck a bit and try again

> As a thought experiment then, what would a quest look like that is equal in difficulty to Carn Dum and yet fair/well-designed?

Hmmm this is hard as I have yet to beat Carn Dum and think that I potentially never will with the decks I use (or at least not till I make myself sit down and play 20+ games in a row till I squeak out a win) but have beaten pretty much everything else to date so its hard to compare. Instead I will list some quests that I think are quite difficult but are designed far better than Carn Dum and usually allow you to at least get part way into the quest before you get annihilated.

 

-Ruins of Belegost is just amazing, won't say much on this one as most people don't even have it yet anyway

-Battle of Five Armies is hard but more about strategy and where to quest and when and can be overcome with a variety of decks so long as they are fairly powerful and you are clever in the way you approach it

-Nin-In-Eilph which many people really hate I actually don't mind and although it is pretty **** hard it also requires quite a bit of strategy and thinking like battle of five armies and just has great art and theme and whatnot. You also have time to prepare for the big bad boss rather than having him in your face round 1 being a total ******. You do need to quest hard and fast though.

-Nightmare Stewards Fear is just fantastic and quite difficult but also manageable and very replayable.

-To Catch an Orc which also gets quite a bit of hate at times and was actually a quest I really disliked when we first got it is also quite hard but still a brilliant quest. Once you get the hang of it and know what you need to do and when/how etc it is not quite so difficult. DO NOT let stage 2 run out of time counters at any point no matter what.

Haven't played Ruins, but want to.

Battle of Five Armies is on the short list for all time best quest.

Nin-In-Eilph was not hard. It was just drudgery. It was monotonous and tedious. It was probably my least favorite quest to date. I'm not sure I will ever play it again, and I love to replay stuff.

Nightmare Steward's Fear is insane. It is so hard, but in a way that draws you in.

To Catch an Orc was okay, not great.

For me, I played from day one and I basically smashed any quest I wanted, then I basically started doing crazy combo decks instead and now I prefer to play easy quests or easy mode because you can win with Dwalin decks and so forth. The harder a quest is the less variety you can play with.

Then I played Morgul Vale and it kicked my butt so hard I still cringe. I never net deck or use forums to "solve" quests. I always want to do it myself. I know other people found the quest pretty easy, but for me it was like the quest had been perfectly designed to counter my style of play, not even sure how. Like others complained about Dul Guldur, but I beat that first try and found it pretty easy. People complained about Into Ithilien, but I played it once, then built a deck to beat it, and that deck I built has like a 90% win rate against the quest (it uses the twins, which I know you like).

But Morgul Vale was still crushing me after like 30 decks and a hundred tries. It was so freaking frustrating. When I finally did beat it I found out from an official ruling that I had been cheating. I even wrote into Caleb to lobby my case and he told me he appreciated the passion but my wins were invalid. I had to go back and try again. Eventually I mastered the quest, but it took forever. Today, that is still one of my favorites. (If you are curious I was trying to win by moving damage from a bodyguard to final boss using infighting, but Caleb said the damage was still reduced to 1. The deck that finally beat it is a mono green Grima trap deck. Now with Damrod the quest is chump)

I beat Can Dum first try. I have beat it with 3 different decks since then and I don't even think it is that hard. I am not saying that to brag. I am merely suggesting that perhaps this is more a case of personal style than "bad design". The designers just happened to counter your style. Don't worry. Keep at it. After you Crack the code you may find that this quest becomes one of your favorites. (I beat it with a Hama feint recycle combo deck, never broke a sweat. I beat it with purple secrecy timely aid, good tale, sneak attack deck, Seastan runs something very similar, and I beat it with a Dain dwarf OP deck, one hit kill erebor battle master, Gimli ally is unstoppable).

To be honest, I'd count all those as wins. That you outsmarted the designers and forced them to make a new rule up to cover their oversight is not your fault at all.

Yeah, I agree. The closest example would be moving resources not being equal to adding resources, so then moving damage is not equal to dealing damage (as per designer, the difference between moving and adding is that as the result of adding, there is more resources than there was before, while moving resources keeps total amount of them the same, which means moving damage doesn't changes the total amount of damage on the board, hence moving damage doesn't equals to dealing damage).

## 215 [NathanH on December 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1918404)

I have no problem with the rule "any effect that causes damage tokens to be gained by a character or enemy counts as 'dealing damage'", but it's a rule that has to be explicitly written down. Indeed, I think this is a good rule, because having a distinction between gaining damage tokens and receiving damage is unappealing to me.

But the designers have, because when the matter was resources, they made quite a distinction between  Gaining and Adding resources. All I'm doing is projecting the same judgement they did, but on damages.

I find this very hard, I haven't won it yet,  played maybe half a dozen times or so.   But I haven't given up on it yet.  Maybe it will go down in the annals of "what were they thinking?"  but maybe not.  

Though I havent yet mustered a win (and like PsychoRocka I play 2 handed and refuse to specifically deckbuild.   I also use 1 core set only), I have seemed to make some gains, so I am hopeful this can be a quest that can be figured out.    It does take some luck.   Not seeing the Treachery cards is very helpful.   Getting mass treachery is rough.  

I hesitate still to call this a bad quest, but the one thing that concerns me mostly is the mass shadow cards, many of which are sort of "damned if you do, damned if you don't".  As was alluded to earlier, if you chump block, you can pay dearly for that.   But if you block with a hero you can pay dearly for that too,  even a strong defender hero can go down fairly easily to a strong enemy with +1 attack/ally you control.  And Amarthiel is sort of a joke on this quest,  which is a shame, since I think he's a really good hero most of the time.   Like if they wanted to design a quest specifically to convince you that 3 def/ 3 Hp is not a good idea... it would be this quest.

> As a thought experiment then, what would a quest look like that is equal in difficulty to Carn Dum and yet fair/well-designed?

 

1) Thaurdir swiches after getting four shadow cards instead of three or

 

2) Remove that -10 threat leavel reducement

 

3) No surge effects on sorcery cards

 

4) Change the card text of Daechanar's Will by adding an alternative or at least remove the shadow effect

 

5) Give the players a bonus, like in the scenarios before. Like some attachment that gives a hero + 1 or 2 DEF

 

 

I really like the idea of this quest and the mechanics it is using. I love that this quest keeps you busy right until the end. However, I think that the designers wanted to put too many different things into this quest. This quest could be awesome and potentially one of the best so far, but some of the design decions are simply awful. By "bad quest design" I don't mean that this quest is bad because of its mechanics, but because of it's unplayability for most of the decks.

 

Btw, did they give up the easy mode?

I love all those quests you've mentioned, but I think it's hard for me to figure out how you classify a quest as difficult vs. unfair. I've heard many people complain about the progress removal in Nin-In-Eilph being unfair, or the location lock of Steward's Fear being unfair. But to me this is the design of the quest and the whole point is to overcome it.

 

When I think of an unfair quest, I think of something like Return to Mirkwood. It's clear to me that it wasn't properly playtested in solo. The core design of the quest is built on bouncing Gollum around so that the massive downside of watching him is spread out over the players. Escape from Dol Guldur is another example. No thought for scalability whatsoever. Dealing with 1 captive and 3 objectives as a solo player is objectively unfair because 4 players have the same setup.

 

Carn Dum doesn't have these elements. It's very tough, but not unfair. Whatever is causing you to lose over and over is part of the design intention and must be overcome. There are at least 10+ different solo archetypes to play with that can handle the quest. For two-handed play, it's possible to build decks that are anywhere from completely useless to game-breaking, so just take your pick in power level and go from there.

 

It you feel that the quest is still too demanding in what decks you can use, or it you really want to stick to a strong theme with your decks and avoid the power cards, then there is an officially supported easier mode of play for such circumstances. The developers have gone to the extra effort to indicate what cards you should remove from the quest to make it easier. There is no shame in easy mode, especially for a quest like this.

You guys don't have to convince me on the rules. I think moving damage is not dealing damage just like moving resouces. I am just saying that Caleb made an official ruling against me.

I ressurected the thread called Ranger Danger where I posted the decklist that smashes into Ithilien. I guess that list is actually tweaked for Drudan Forest (which at the time I thought was the more difficult quest... oops). The more I played the deck though, the more I realized it was really a highly focused and specialized deck that only worked against a few quests like Into Ithilien, but it smashes that quest pretty hard.

finally beat it!  Not sure how many attempts,  at least a dozen.   Did it with usual Rohan deck paired with Gondor.    So it's sort of a personal victory,  but I won't be giving advice on this quest any time soon I don't think.  Had some luck, and completed 6 side quests!  (Gather Info x2, Scout Ahead, Double Back, Orc Ambush, Power of Agmar) Woot!

West-Road traveller to get out of Battle was helpful though,  and doing all those side-quests did allow us to get the best stuff.  Also I used The Long Defeat.   Nice card, I was pleased.

Emphasis is mine. I am surprised to hear you say this. I played a couple of my top-tier decks against it and got utterly smashed. I will probably play again at some point, but I honestly don't have the same motivation to keep trying that I did with Into Ithilien. I definitely believe that there is a finely tuned deck that can fair pretty well against this quest (just like there was one for Into Ithilien). I feel like 10+ solo archetypes is an exaggeration, but I don't count your "first turn remove all encounter cards from the game" decks since I would never play them (no offense intended, they just only hold interest for me as hypothetical concepts).

 

Do you really mean 10 legitimate solo archetypes or was that hyperbole? If you did, would you care to enumerate them? I am very curious to hear your opinion on which decks you think can even somewhat consistently handle this quest. Perhaps I've been unlucky in my play-throughs so far. One game I had a hero death on turn 1 because of surging Sorceries (two Heavy Curses into a Terror of the North) and an immediate attack by Thaurdir (with predictably awful shadow effects). I understand that there are things that I can do to mitigate this, but even as someone who plays nightmare quests this feels a bit extreme. Maybe it is just fatigue with the game, but whereas the losses against Into Ithilien made me want to design a deck to beat it, losses against this quest just make me want to take a break for a while.

Well, it's hard to have a concept like surge without the occasional bad streak. I just scoop and comfort myself by knowing that the probability of it was quite small. You can get 3-4 blocking wargs in a row on your first turn of Into Ithilien and I think the best way to deal with that is chuckle and try again. Though I'd be happy to see a rule like maximum X surges per round, where X is the number of players.

 

I really did mean 10+ solo archetypes.

 

I have 5 playthroughs with totally different decks up on my channel. I summarize them here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194594-the-battle-of-carn-dum-is-breaking-me/?p=1911250]. None of them remove the encounter deck from the game (as I can't figure out how to do that in solo play). Here are the deck styles:

 

1. Boromir

2. Gandalf+Elrond

3. Erestor+Bilbo

4. Loragorn+Frodo

5. Reinforcements+A Very Good Tale

 

Here are others that I haven't made videos of:

 

6. Hama+Feint

7. Outlands

8. Dwarf Swarm with Dain

9. Dwarf Swarm without Dain

10. Dunedain/Ranger Traps

11. Mirkwood Pioneer [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194684-carn-dum-solo-deck/?p=1919051]

 

I'm not saying they win every time, just that they have a decent shot. If they didn't, then recording a playthrough would get too frustrating, as I don't have all the time in the world.

I wondered why I was so frustrated with this scenario, but less with Dol Guldur at the time. I think it is because With Dol Guldur I knew after a dozen tries that it was impossible. Do Guldur is like the big Hill Troll who is standing right in front of you and swinging its club at your head. You know you're gonna be smashed no matter what you do. Dol Guldur never pretended that it was anything else than a solo killer.

 

Carn Dum OTOH gives you the impression that it is beatable. There is only one card that is outright unfair, all the other cards are mean, but not in a sense that you cannot master them. But the fact that every card is a bit harder than usual and that there are almost no cards that can give you a break usually let your games end in a desaster. So Carn Dum is looking more like an unusual big Orc, someone who looks dangerous, but who you think you can beat somehow. You hit at him, he hits back, you hurt him and push him into a corner. But then this Orc suddenly jumps at you with the grace of en elf and fires with various weapons and in a blink of an eye your whole party is dead. And that's what's frustrating.

I was able to easily beat this quest with this deck:

 

Gandalf

Galadriel

Elrond

 

 

Allies:

 

x1 Skinbark

x1 Landroval

x3 bilbo baggins

x1 envoy of pelargir

x1 beorn

x1 galadriel's handmaiden 

x1 Erestor

x1 Legolas

x1 Gildor inglorian

x1 Faramir

x1 Treebeard

x1 Gimli

x1 Arwen

x1 Bofur

x1 Haldir

x1 Orophin

x1 master of the forge

x1 Gwahir

x1 Rumiel

x3 northern tracker

x1 Radagast

 

Attachments:

 

x3 lembas

x3 vilya

x3 unexpected courage

x1 Wizard pipe

x1 Shadowfax

x1 Light of valinor

x1 Nenya

x1 Gandalfs staff

x1 Protector of Lorien 

 

Events:

x3 elronds council

x3 test of will

x2 flame of anor

x2 Galadrim's Greeting

 

The deck was not made with this quest in mind, it was inspired by Master of Lore's "Wielder's of the Three" deck, obviously with lots of modifications.  The deck wasn't built with Carn Dum in mind, so it could probably be optimized to be even more efficient against it.  The deck can be tricky to play as there are many decisions to make, but the goal is mulligan for Vilya.  With smart play of Gandalf and his pipe, you should be drawing through the majority of your deck before the game is over (his ability is once per phase, keep in mind, that's a huge mistake I see people make with him that makes him less effective.  For example, you want to start the planning phase with say a test of will, or elrond's council on top of your deck.  Playing them from the top of your deck is essentially drawing another card).  If you haven't used his pipe yet, and you have a card you can play from your hand, put it on top of your deck and play it from there instead, as it's giving you another card draw.  Gandalf requires a lot of manipulation to get the best use of him.  

 

Another mistake is to not use his staff to cancel shadow cards, this is what I use it for 99% of the time.

Yep, this would fall under category 2 of my above list. It's a killer deck that can feel quite thematic. But some people don't like Vilya.

> Why no Imladris Stargazer?

 

At first I did have 2 of them.  After playtesting it a lot, I found it unnecessary.  Gandalf lets you know what's on top of your deck anyway for using Vilya.  And everytime I had her in my hand I was always wishing I had another big ally in my hand instead.  When you can play anything for free, it feels better to have a 5 cost ally with tons of stats than a 2 cost with none.  (Of course she's AMAZING in the right deck, I use her all the time, but in this deck she's not so useful). And once you have Vilya and the pipe, you almost feel like it doesn't matter what you draw next when every card in the deck is amazing.

In terms of people not liking Vilya, this is the same problem I have when people say they don't like Glorfindel.  These cards SHOULD BE powerful.  Vilya is the most powerful ring in Tolkien's lore (besides the one ring of course).  If it was a dud it would be awful in terms of keeping with the source material.  I love how it radically changes the way you play and deck build.  I love that it feels overpowered.  Having very different deck building options is what makes this my favorite game.  That's not to say I'd always play with it, I love weaker decks too, play hobbits more than anything, but Vilya and Glorfindel should be powerful otherwise the designers would have lost touch with what they're basing the game on.

And here is where you are wrong IMO. I just lost 7 games in a row due to bad card draws. 4 times I revealed Daechanar's Will, I even managed to survive one time only to be killed three turns later. In one game I was almost set and done when three sorcery cards in a row destroyed my party during the second quest phase. 2 times I lost when Thaurdir got three sorcery cards while at least to 4+ ATt enemies where still sitting in the staging area. This scenario is supposed to give the players these bad streaks, and that's why it is poorly designed.

 

And that's why I decided to stop playing Carn Dum. Let's hope the next scenario is better.

I don't play Gandalf in multiplayer ever.  I see why he is annoying in multiplayer not just for how long his turns can take, but also robbing tactics decks of much needed card draw and threat reduction.  But he's a blast to play solo.

Well, it wasn't my opinion. The odds of getting Daechanar's Will on turn one is around 1/25. The odds of getting two surging Sorceries into a third Sorcery is like 1/2700. Assuming solo play of course.

The sorceries didn't surge, but I drew them turn by turn. I had Thaurdir at 9 damage, I had Faramir and StwB, just needed to make 15 progress - three turns later Thaurdir was down to zero damage, attacking me twice each turn, and I was left with only two heroes, three allies and a threat of 47. <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]

It might just be my style, but perhaps I wait longer in stage 1 than you do. I never want to spend more than a single turn in stage 2.

 

I normally plan it this way:

 * Advance to stage 2.
 * Flip Thaurdir, defend the attack.
 * Defend Thaurdir in combat phase.
 * Put 12-15 damage on Thaurdir.
 * Next turn, get 15 progress on quest, with a defender ready to take an attack from Thaurdir should a sorcery be revealed.

 

I generally won't advance until I'm very confident that I can do the above. It save a lot of headache in stage 2. It's kind of like the new Conflict at the Carrock.

Count me as one who actually enjoys Battle of Carn Dum. I haven't been this challenged (outside of Nightmare) since Nin-in-Eilph and I like having to carefully strategize and deck build. I had to drop my usual Boromir deck and actually won with a mono-Leadership Aragorn/Balin/Imrahil deck. It was a surprise to me to win with a tweaked version of an old deck I used to use and to beat such a hard quest with a different type of build. I'm really looking forward to trying out other decks. I am a glutton for punishment though! I personally like quests that can actually hit you even when you think you have it under control, so that you can never rest easy, which can be kind of boring.

 

So much of the experience of this game is subjective, but when an easy quest comes out, many start worrying that the game is getting too easy, and then when a quest like this come out, many start worrying that the game is getting too hard. I wouldn't worry either way, the design strategy of the game seems to be to provide a mix of difficulties throughout each cycle, so some you'll like, some you won't as much, but it'll average out.

Yeah, it's legal, but obviously it only applies to Indestructible enemies. That strategy dates all the way back to Shadow and Flame.

seriously?  I'd never consider that an option but I guess it is similar to putting excess quest points on a quest that you can't actually advance past until a certain enemy is dead or something.

Well, after I could not get any good out of this quest, I decided to use my one deck, the one that has never lost a quest for me. Galadriel, Spirfindel, Gandalf. I changed it a bit and inlcuded some Ents to attack, defend and quest with and on attempt one I won with an easy pace. I believe that the encounter deck did not come as bad as it could but non the less after turn 4 it was certain to be a win, it was just a matter of time. Just before I quest to put the 15th Token on stage one I played the "Shadows give way" event so advanced unharmed and with Gandalf having Burning Brand, Gondorian Shield, Steward of Gondor and arwen in play as well as Shadowfax and Unexpected courage, Thaurdir could do no harm to me since I was defending with 6, no shadow effects and could defend multiple enemied

You cannot even beat it with good cards. I tried Loragorn, Treebeard and Merry with a good Ent deck, three games I was near victory but lost all of them (one out of my mistake, I could have won but anyway). Once in a while it is interesting for such a challenging quest to appear. Eventually after a few AP's it will be more managable, like Escape From Dol Guldur, or Battle of Lake town which were very tough on their early days, but nowdays they can be won with more ease

 

I will play it again with the same deck I won to test if it was pure luck though  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I have a very good win ratio with a 2 handed deck that really doesn't use any of the overpowered cards. It is definitely not 100% but around 80%, which I feel pretty good about considering I was doing my best to create and interesting deck while not using any of the powerful cards such as Steward, Unexpected Courage, Test of Will or Sneak attack Gandalf.

First Deck is Legolas, Haldir, and Damrod. Full of traps, Bows, and Blades.

Second Deck is Erkenbrand, Idraen, and Sam. Both these decks were combined to reduce the awful shadow effects that are present in this game, I kept losing due to the punishing Shadow effects and lack of Hero actions. Therefore Sam and Idraen are to provide extra readying, Erkenbrand to cancel nasty shadows, Haldir and Legolas to snipe, Damrod to neuter the enemies capabilities. Idraen with Silver Lamp allowed me to see which enemies had the worst shadow cards. I've tried it against other difficult quests as well, and with almost no modification works very well, against NM Morgul Vale, NM Return to mirkwood (if you race), NM Black Riders.

Personally I like having a good mix of quests. People complain about quests when they're too hard but honestly you are not required to play every quest in this game. You can be content for months, if not years, playing the "easy quests" that already exist in this game. Why do people begrudge the occasional difficult quest? If there were no super hard quests I wouldn't like this game. I don't want a walk in the park, I want to be challenged. If anything I think the majority of quests in this game tend to be on the easy side if anything. There's no quest in this game that you can't specifically make a deck to dominate it.

I've suggested before the designers really need to go out of the box more and make more quests that either punish readying outside of the refresh phase or don't allow it at all. Same with extra card draw.

If you think this quest, or lake town, etc, are too challenging don't play them. I'm not trying to be harsh here either by saying that. There are so many quests in this game there's room for everyone to be happy.

Or just do the "story" mode option where you remove some of the more punishing cards.

The 'don't play it' is unfortunate because by design an adventure cycle should not be interrupted/skipped. Lake Town has the player go get it on purpose, out of band, to decide to suffer through it. I did! I didn't like it but I don't need to be so disappointed about their decision since it was on purpose a "challenge". This is in the cycle, standing in the way (if you want to, obviously, defeat them in order) of the last quest.

 

Finally, to your point of 'there is no quest to dominate it'... see, I absolutely want every quest to have me fail it the first few times, until you deck build then it should be a fair fight, a tough fight, but one you can win. Go see me on bgg, over 200 plays, all quests. Eventually, even the hard ones, are conquered. But usually not with 8+ continuous fails. I've come to realize I can only beat this one either by reading someone's combotastic deck (I don't like to do that) or by exploiting the game to the max (elrond-vilya-uber-deck). When it goes too far that way, I feel like I may as well say "Okay, my heroes now all have +5 defense" and then sure, I'll beat it.

 

 I'll still try a few more times (it IS kinda fun to take days off, then come back and try something a little crazy)...  I just want to go on record, as a 200 quest player, not a uber deck builder but an avid one, as a player that has defeated all other cycle adventures, etc.... this one stands out as a bit way too much, with effects that give the player, the "wtf how unfair is that" feeling.

 

Oh, and I'm doing easy mode (only did normal about three times)... and actually, I do suspect this is one of those where easy mode doesn't NECESSARILY make it easier due to the ratio of some cards now having been changed.

Had a really exciting game using Seastan's ranger deck. Almost won, but in fact lost due to a stupid mistake. I didn't even know about the effect on 2a. I actually forgot to use Aragorn's ability the round before, and I was at threat 47 or so. Very stupid, but nonetheless that deck is really good. It's surprisingly not hard to get at least 2 snares really fast, and then off you go. Ever since Leadership became as good if not better at questing as Spirit, and since Lore got many more of these anti-enemy cards, I've thought Leadership-Lore is as good a combination, if not better in some cases, than Spirit-Tactics, at least is solo. Spirit-Tactics is still pretty darn powerful, but getting arguably the best two things in a card game, resources and card draw, can really be better. Gotta give it to the Dwarves too, as the best dwarf solo deck IMO is the one with Dain, Thorin and Ori. 

## 253 [Seastan on December 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1944634)

Grateful for the feedback Gizlivadi!

 

I find the best, albeit cheesy, way to handle Carn Dum is to let all the encounter get trapped up in shadow cards on the Snared enemies. Then no more sorceries can get revealed (or any other card for that matter). You then handle the 2A effect using Favor of the Valar (originally I was using shadows give way + good harvest until I think Cmabr pointed out this easier and better method).

 

I'll post the Carn-Dum adjusted decklist imminently.

We complain, because we pay a good amount of money to have some fun. And not to skip a quest.

 

(If you're searching for impossible challenges, simply play nightmare mode.)

 

We complain, because this quest is badly designed.

 

I complain, because I want to use the new cards instead of locking them away in a box.

A few years back I did a walking pilgrimage that was 800 km.  It took over a month to walk it.  If it would have taken one day, I'd call it a day hike instead of a pilgrimage.  Some things are better when they take time to achieve.

 

It is OK if you lose a quest, even 20 times in a row.  You can have fun with that if your mind is in the right place.  Winning is just the end goal.

I agree with Grandspleen. Since most of the quest are not that hard it is nice to have a quest once in a while that you have to try hard, think options for your deck etc. That might help you create better combos or ways of playing, even use cards you thought would never do - i never believed ranger spikes and forest patrol are going ever to be used before i used them together on crossroads to kill Harads without even exhausting a character to attack.

Personally i lost Crossroads (or dumbed it cause there was no hope) more than 15 games before i found a deck with which i won 2 out of 4. And i could say i am on time pressure too (apart from work schedule) cause i have two small kids who when are awake i cannot play

With Carn Dum have not yet managed to beat it with my Dunedain deck after i tried 5 games -but won it with a Spirfindel Gandalf Galadriel- and now after Journey on the Crossroads, the way i used rangers with traps etc gave me some new ideas to try on Dunedain on Carn Dum again.

Easier or medium quests give players a good time, but harder make them "better" even if they keep loosing them

There's a guy on BGG that just posted saying they tried it fourty times! I don't think that's a data point to be proud of...  I think a quest's difficulty, when part of a normal cycle, not gencon stuff, not nightmare, should be something like, for say a hard quest:

 

try it with random deck. lose. perhaps try again, lose

decide to deck build something.  try, lose. tweak, try, lose

figure out you had the wrong idea, deck build the second big idea, try and lose maybe but get close

perhaps a last deck build, maybe with a tweak, and win.

Just to be clear (again, because I've said this before), I am not pointing out that I beat it first try to brag. As I have said I lost to Morgul Vale at least 20 times (probably closer to 40) before beating that quest. FFG can control the words that they put on the cards but they can't control your ability to play. Somehow if they make a quest that you have a hard time figuring out they are doing something wrong? That is what they are supposed to do. It is absolutely okay if you lose the quest 20, 30, or 40 times. It just means the quest is hard. This game has been hard since day 1. If you want a cake walk go play Dead Marshes or play a different game or wait a year for the cardpool to expand. But complaining as if FFG has morally offended you is just silly. I don't get it.

I actually haven't gotten a chance to try this quest again, but a friend and i very nearly beat this on our second attempt and we had not done any specific deck building for it.  and we would have won if the last shadow card wasn't what it was.  any other card and it would have been a victory.  

 

That said, I'm glad the quest seems hard and is very challenging.  I'm not glad that it seems others have had to play it 20+ times to get a victory.  But a lot of those that are playing it that many times seems to be OK with that turn out, and - understandably so - are quit proud once they do get their victory. 

 

A lot of the debate right now is all perspective based though, and while each of us is capable of seeing from the other persons perspective, that doesn't mean it will change our mind about our own thoughts on this quest - or the game in general.  

 

I do think that if I had to play a quest 20+ times before I beat it, but know that others have beaten it, then I clearly need to rethink my deck-building ideas and even my game play strategies.  Clearly what I'm doing isn't working.   I wouldn't take this as a fault in the designers. 

 

As far as deck building, I do like to build utility decks that can handle a lot of things and use that deck for every quest.  However, I also understand that not every deck idea I make is going to be strong enough to deal with the encounter deck.  You've got to have options and be willing to try completely different ideas.  For example, I've disliked the Dunedain trait for awhile until I saw a deck list that uses Damrod and Forest Snares and even then had to participate in the discussion about why its' OK the Dunedain were relying on traps, making Damrod an excellent fit, before I starting to come around to liking the trait and what it was trying to do.  

 

Anyways, I don't think this quest is bad design.  I think this quest fills a much needed spot of being the next go-to quest for a serious challenge.  I've often seen Laketown brought up in this thread, and just thinking of a non-nightmare quest that compares to that is outstanding for me - and several others.  I understand there are plenty of people that dislike the difficulty of this quest.  I'm curious, have any of you tried to quest with the gold ring cards removed?  The designers put those in to have a built-in way of lowering the difficulty of a quest easily and I know several people do this on a regular basis because that is how they would rather play the game.  

 

to each their own.

I think if you lose this quest forty times in a row you shouldn't be playing a game that involes deck-building unless you're have someone else make your decks for you (and in that case get second else to make your decks). I had some time to watch seastan beat this quest several times, the deck I beat it with was similar to his gandalf deck (though I made mine independently of his and I have galadriel instead of glorfindel). I honestly beat the quest with barely breaking a sweat with that deck (and I've lost with other decks to be fair).

Personally I want some HARDER quests. We have tons of easy quests already, but only a handful which I would say are challenging outside of nightmare and even many of those are easy now. You could spend many many MANY hours playing all of the easy quests in this game and not getting bored. The adventure packs are so cheap, and do repayable even if you lose you're getting your money's worth.

Also great suggestions already we're posted for playing the game on easy mode.

## 263 [PsychoRocka on December 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1949179)

Ok I think some people are playing or doing something wrong with this quest big time.

Yes I've only had a few more attempts at it but how fast I lose and how quickly it spirals out of control just puts a bad taste in my mouth and stops me from even wanting to make more attempts. I really do think it is horribly designed. 

I can accept some people not having that much trouble and certain people overcoming it with particular decks and strategies but I feel like some are just taking it too far. I personally think this is hands down easily the hardest quest to date, inclusive of POD. I think Lake town is far easier than this quest. Same goes for BoFA, shadow and flame, morgul vale etc.

 

Sorry, but all of the people carrying on about nightmare, do you actually own and play most of the nightmare quests? even the newer ones?

There are very few nightmare quests I can think of that are harder than this quest and even then they are far more cleverly designed and are difficult because they make you think and present such a different challenge from anything else (for example nightmare druadan forest) and are unique as opposed to being mind numbingly hard and painful.

 

Plenty of quests are especially hard. zeromage have you beaten nightmare shadow and flame? nightmare foundations of stone? nightmare encounter at amon din? (this one is an absolute pain fest!) they are all brutal (but at least far more fun and you can get far further before being crushed unlike carn dum) and so are many of the nightmare quests in the heirs of numenor cycle. Plus they are NIGHTMARE quests, specifically designed to be brutal. It really isn't that bad if you rack up 20 losses against a Nightmare quest because you signed yourself up for that. Just trying to beat the second last quest in a cycle should not be like playing one of the hardest nightmare quests....
Have you got Lake Town and Ruins of Belegost? Both very hard as well.

Do you play with the broken beats-everything and does everything Gandalf hero?

If you don't play nightmare, don't have these quests or play Gandalf I highly recommend nightmare and those quests and strongly disagree with your opinion that we don't have hard quests out there. There are a whole ton of difficult quests in this game, Nin-in-Eilph, To Catch an Orc, Battle of Five Armies, Dol Guldur etc and any time anyone new gets into the game people are incredibly quick to warn them of just how hard this game can be. It is definitely no walk in the park!

If you have all these quests and already play nightmare and still think we need harder quests (harder than carn dum, nightmare amon din and ruins of belegost) then you either play with incredibly overpowered decks or are doing something wrong. 

I definitely disagree that we need harder quests. Even some saga quests are downright brutal (helms deep and moria/balrog quest forget the name).

 

Not everyone is superman Seastan and also not everyone wants to play with broken cheesey gandalf decks. I do believe that a bunch of others have beaten it with specifically tailored decks or some of their stronger decks after a bunch of attempts but some people are taking it a bit far ("guys this is so easy why cant you beat it, why dont you play easy mode then, we need even harder quests!") and I feel they are either playing the quest completely incorrectly, are playing easy mode and not mentioning it or just got insanely lucky and won a single game that they would probably not be able to replicate without many many attempts. 

 

No it is not impossible or anything but many people play this game differently and quite a lot of people (like me) like to use decks that are strong but not the very top tier and still quite thematic (as opposed to throwing theme out the window and building the strongest and most unthematic deck possible) or like to use the same fairly powerful deck/s for every quest or even like to use decks with a fun or interesting theme (traps, noldor discard mechanic, etc there are so many!). When they build quests that can only really be beaten by top tier decks (except for what seems to be a few exceptions) or by specifically building up decks built just for that one quest I think it is a bit of a disservice to the majority of players of the game. 

This quest in my opinion is definitely the absolute bane of any player that is in the one/two decks to rule them all camp.

 

I get that its a deck building game but man, I really don't think there are THAT many of us that build new decks for every single new quest. I know alot of you guys build new decks and change up what decks you are using pretty **** regularly and have several decks at any one time but correct me if I'm wrong, the vast majority of people seem to build multiple decks far far more so to try out different spheres, different heroes, different thematic decks or cool ideas/combos or different traits. I bet there are so few people that build all their different decks based on a certain quest compared to those that build their decks based mainly on a certain idea, line up or trait. 

To get to the point, people deck build to create new decks with cool combos, themes or ideas far far more than people deck build for quests. 

 

Also people really need to stop recommending easy mode or asking if people have tried easy mode. I get that for some players this is definitely the answer but not everyone is ok with resorting to that, especially if you have beaten pretty much every other quest the game has ever thrown at you including most nightmare quests, all POD etc without ever having to play easy mode. 

 

If Carn Dum sets some sort of trend and we start to regularly get quests this difficult that are not Nightmare, PoD or right at the end of the saga campaign (when we have a million boons and will actually want the quests to be downright brutal because of this and because we will be on the doorstep of Mordor about to finish the saga campaign!) I will definitely stop playing. It is hard enough to find regular time to play a game of this nature that has so many moving parts, so much set up and can take an hour+ to finish a single game at times, especially if you play solo two handed that it will 100% not be worth it if 9 out of 10 games you are just getting absolutely hammered. The game is already hard enough and whats more we have really seen the developers curb back the power creep of player cards lately (making them more fun and combo-y than just straight up powerful) yet encounter cards do seem to still be getting stronger.

I've played this game from almost the very first release I'm pretty sure I know how to play. This game isn't exactly like playing warhammer with a 200+ page rulebook, it's pretty easy to know the rules. Unfortunately I don't post playthrough videos, but if you want to learn how to beat the quest watch seastan's video series if you think this quest is impossible. I'm not saying I'm as good as him but if you think I have to be playing wrong to beat this quest with a gandalf deck maybe you're playing wrong.

I've seen a guy who could beat nearly nightmare quest with a single hero hirluin deck. I wish I could take credit for that one. Seastan has said he beat almost every (or maybe every) nightmare quest with a boromir deck. People have beat every quest with song decks. I've beaten a good number of nightmare quests with two dwarf decks, and that was before the card pool was as good as it is now.

I'm not saying I can beat every quest the first playthrough but if you deck build for a specific quest you should be able to beat it, barring bad luck.

There's definitely no reason to think that Carn Dum's difficulty level will become the new normal, or even anything close to it.  As I pointed out previously, they assigned Carn Dum a diffiulty rating of 8, which is the highest they ever assign (Assault on Osgiliath and Shadow and Flame also got 8... saga and POD quests don't get ratings).  So they were intentionally making something very very hard here.  This cycle has some absolute softballs as well.  (Ettenmoors, Mount Gram).

 

I do want to see hard quests continue to be released.  While it may offend the sensibilities to play on easy mode, it offends the wallet to play on nightmare mode so.... no sympathy from me.  Give the players a variety of difficulty levels within the standard cycle, yes please!

 

edit: also many folks probably haven't had a chance to try Dread Realm yet, but it is waaaaaaaay easier than Carn Dum.

I get what you are trying to say PsychoRocka but I think you weaken your point by going to far. Assuming that everyone who is beating the quest is breaking the rules or using Gandalf is not going to get you much sympathy.

 

There is a large (and growing) list of decks that can beat Carn Dum in < 5 attempts. Most of them use very strong cards, but that's what it takes to beat a very hard quest. When designing what is supposed to be a maximum difficulty quest, the developers are not going to factor in the possibility that players don't want to use Steward because it's out of theme of their Dwarf deck. Rather, they are going to design the quest to be a challenge for the best decks the current card pool can produce. Complaining that it can't be beaten with self-imposed restrictions is no more credible a complaint than not being able to beat Passage through Mirkwood with a Dale deck. Now, I like theme too, but I understand that it's weaker. Thankfully they have produced an easier mode of play for such circumstances.

## 267 [PsychoRocka on December 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1949415)

yeah see thats the problem though. Not everyone wants to play a dodgy as hell draw your entire deck first go song deck, abuse the **** out of boromir and make him a 20 will, 20 attack, 20 def, sentinel, ranged one man wrecking machine deck, or dodgy outlands one hero deck. People want to use cool powerful thematic decks that aren't cheesily powerful though, most of us at least. All power to those who do want to play these decks I just don't think one should be required to play them to beat a non-nightmare quest.

 

Also not saying you are playing it wrong I just suggested that perhaps some people are as there are quite a few saying they are beating it easily whilst others are just banging their head against it to no avail. Also wasn't implying any sort of connection between Gandalf hero and playing the quest wrong, I just personally hate that hero and think hes mega OP and so when people are able to achieve things with him to me it doesn't really count or mean anything because of course they achieved what they wanted with the most powerful OP hero in the game. I'm definitely not playing this quest wrong(at least I really hope not), hence the non stop defeats. I am incredibly meticulous and careful when I play this game as I am a big time rules stickler and would not be able to truly call a game in which I use house rules or bend the rules a victory so always try to 100% follow the rules. 

 

also have to say I disagree with your whole "this isn't warhammer so its pretty easy to know the rules". There are constant rulings from the developers that directly contradict earlier rulings, incredibly nitty gritty discussions about how particular cards interact that end in flame wars and people needing to ask the developers for a final ruling and even then that sometimes doesn't quench the arguments and a massive FAQ and Rules document as well as resources like this one specifically because the rules can be complex and intricate at times: http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf]

Definitely not warhammer but saying the rules are "easy" is definitely something I disagree with. Not that they are particularly hard either but you kind of need to get used to the very unique way the game plays and the various interactions particular effects have and the order in which they resolve etc. 

 

just wanted to add no disrespect or nastiness intended from my posts we clearly just have very different opinions and thoughts on the matter!

## 268 [DukeWellington on December 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1949435)

My point--the one I have been trying to get across--is that the quest may be difficult FOR YOU because you play with a specific style or strategy that the quest WAS DESIGNED to counter. The Dunland quests, in similar fashion, we're designed to counter a specific style, a style I happen to utilize. All my standard decks lost to those quests, but I just tried a different style and then I beat them. It was challenging and uncomfortable. I don't particularly like those quests, but I certainly don't feel like FFG did something wrong to me personally.

That is what I don't understand. Like, if you can't beat a quest with the type of deck you want to beat it with, then clearly the game designers did something wrong. It makes no sense. The designers have specifically said that they design the quests to counter player strategies. Isn't that what they are supposed to do?

The complaining really annoys me because if I beat the quest and don't experiance your "injustice" then it must be because I cheated or because I'm using invalid strategies that should basically be considered cheating. I mean give me a break.

Many people have beaten the quest, some even beat it easily, using a variety of strategies. The complaints are empirically wrong. When faced with this evidence, the complainers just double down and act like victims? Get over yourselves. Maybe you just need to keep evolving. The designers have no moral obligation to cater to your particular tastes or idea of what counts as a valid approach to deckbuilding. I just don't feel sorrow for you.

No disrespect taken. Not everyone likes cheesy decks, but no one has said that they are required. What about Dwarves, or Ents, or Loragorn/Frodo, or Dunedain, or A Very Good Tale... are all these cheesy too? These are some of the top decks right now, and if there weren't challenging quests like Carn Dum they would just stomp through everything and be quite boring to play.

I don't think you have fully understood the spirit of what I am trying to say, maybe I'm not really communicating well enough.

I don't even play full thematic decks and take plenty of liberties. I'm also not assuming that people are playing it wrong I just said that perhaps this was the case with a couple of people just because there is such a discrepancy between a handful of people being like hard? what? I beat it first go and a handful of people that only get a win after like 10 to 20+ games or not at all. There is a difference between having to use a good deck and having to use one of three or four broken/cheesey decks that have little to no theme at all and rely on some incredibly powerful combo that shuts the encounter deck down. Like for example look at the deck the developers posted alongside the news that this quest is almost out (the twins and arwen). I bet you that deck gets absolutely STOMPED by this quest. I really don't see us seeing eye to eye considering you are kind of like the ambassador for really clever really powerful decks that can break the game. Thank you for replying and sharing your opinion though dude.

Why stop, we could have a nice web fight, Gandalf would be on my side :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] (joking)

PsychoRocka, to start with you are one of the users I like to follow, but I do not tottaly agree.

I too had a bad time against it with my Dunedain Deck, lost two games on turn two, tweaked my deck and next three games got on second quest card. It was a progress, not enough offcourse. I too believe it is the most difficult quest i ever had, BUT i believe the first three -yes even the first one- AP of this cycle where among the easy ones, Mount Gram and Ettenmore did not trouble me for a moment, so it is not that the game is going to become very difficult as I read from some fellow posters.

Ok finally decided to play with a Gandalf Galadriel Glorfindel deck I have, which is mostly thematic, it is a bit Broken I have to admit (more or less after 10 turns i have all my deck on my hand so mostly i play whatever cards I want) but wanted to check if this quest was that hard. I won attempt one easily. Was i lucky, do not know, never tried it again cause since i know that this Gandalf deck has beaten everything, i do not like to use it.

Now Amarthuil hero came and i decided to try another Dunedain deck. Did not have the time yet, but will let you know when i do.

Do not despare I would like to say. I will end with a story of mine. There is one quest i played more rhan 50 games to win only one, which? Stewards Fear (not with Gandalf deck :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ) .... yes this. Never played it again. I just could not do it. I guess most of you did not play more than five games to do it. To win it i changed my hero lineup thrice. I have no answer why this particular quest. Maybe my mind could not master it. So maybe this is your one quest too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

see your exact experience just proves me right though haha. you tried with what was probably quite a good dunedain deck and just got demolished and stood no chance at all then played with the cheesemaster himself Gandalf and beat it first go....

 

yeah maybe this is my one quest... time will tell! Or i'll just beat it once and never touch it again because I honestly do think it is badly designed (not just difficulty, look at this thread for another example of why I think this is the case: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194582-flippin-thaurdir/).

The matter with this quest is not how tough or how soft is. There is no problem in getting some difficult quests from time to time.

 

The question is that this quest is in my humble opinion designed badly or with an "evil" purpose. To me it has no sense how brutal it is and I had to skip it after a lot of attempts with different decks. I could attempt this quest 100 more times until I get a chance pushing my luck to the limit, but I do not find that fun.

 

And it is a pain to think that the quest would be much better and balanced if they would have given to Thaurdir his power only when the first sorcery card is revealed from the encounter deck during the quest phase, not with every sorcery card revealed that way, specially when he is with the champion side up.

I think Duke Wellington is right, the designers purposefully adapt quest to counter specific strategies the players use. I think this quest is beatable, you just have to identify what is the main theme, or nemesis of a quest. Each quest has one, whether it's making you discard cards, lots of enemies, powerful immune to player card effects enemies, lots of locations, limits your attachments, whatever it is. This quests main thing is awful shadow effects, therefore you should adapt your play style slightly, Beregond is going to suffer poorly in this quest. Use Erkenbrand, Haldir (to stop enemy attacks), Elrond, Treebeard, Sam with Staff, all of these hero's have served me well in this quest. There are a lot of options still available without resorting to Glorfindel or Gandalf. I also play 2 handed, which makes it easier though I will admit. Solo might be harder.

> yeah see thats the problem though. Not everyone wants to play a dodgy as hell draw your entire deck first go song deck, abuse the **** out of boromir and make him a 20 will, 20 attack, 20 def, sentinel, ranged one man wrecking machine deck, or dodgy outlands one hero deck. People want to use cool powerful thematic decks that aren't cheesily powerful though, most of us at least. All power to those who do want to play these decks I just don't think one should be required to play them to beat a non-nightmare quest.

Also wasn't implying any sort of connection between Gandalf hero and playing the quest wrong, I just personally hate that hero and think hes mega OP and so when people are able to achieve things with him to me it doesn't really count or mean anything because of course they achieved what they wanted with the most powerful OP hero in the game. I'm definitely not playing this quest wrong(at least I really hope not), hence the non stop defeats. I am incredibly meticulous and careful when I play this game as I am a big time rules stickler and would not be able to truly call a game in which I use house rules or bend the rules a victory so always try to 100% follow the rules.

There are constant rulings from the developers that directly contradict earlier rulings, incredibly nitty gritty discussions about how particular cards interact that end in flame wars and people needing to ask the developers for a final ruling and even then that sometimes doesn't quench the arguments and a massive FAQ and Rules document as well as resources like this one specifically because the rules can be complex and intricate at times: http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf]

No disrespect taken from me.  I didn't mean to say this game's rules are simplistic either, I think it's a very rich game, warhammer is just what popped to the top of my head as I'm an avid tabletop gamer, and the rules debates in that game are enough to drive most people away from it.  

 

I see your point about Gandalf, but I honestly don't think he's more broken than Boromir, or Dwarf decks, or Outlands, or Tactics Aragorn/Merry.  In fact I think Elrond is a bigger piece of the puzzle than Gandalf.  I haven't seen a really good Gandalf deck without Elrond in it (not saying they don't or can't exist, I just haven't seen one).  While I have seen incredibly powerful Elrond decks without Gandalf.  And in multi-player I don't think I'd even put Gandalf in my top ten most powerful heroes.  He robs other decks of a key card which could very well be a lynchpin for many decks.  Many tactics decks rely on his ally version for threat reduction or card draw, for example.  

 

And by the way, my one quest that gave me the most headaches is Nîn-in-Eilph.  That quest took me longer than any other one.  Even most nightmares.  I found it to be much harder than Carn Dum.  But I stand by my point that even with that quest you can tailor a deck to specifically beat it.

i appreciate hard quests as they make you think about the game and how you have to approach a certain encounter. You figure out counter strategies build your deck around those and finally you win.

Its true most People will build their decks with certain ideas in mind rather than building them to Counter a certain Encounter deck.

I, personally, really like building decks and thinking of strategies. There are few enough quests that force you to do so, hence i am glad when one pops up.

I feel like it is a bit of a marketing flaw on the designer's part...

 

If they had named "easy mode" "thematic mode" or some other such word, people would be less averse to playing it.  Even though most people would easily see that it was to reduce the difficulty, it would be more thematic because you can play your thematic decks without getting completely punished.

i guess you dont have to tell anyone you are playing easy mode ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

therefore no punishment.

the problem evolves from within one self.

i never felt myself obliged to defeat every single quest. Up to today i have not beaten battle at lakewell and dunland trap.

I dont have that much time to play though.

I honestly do get your point about the encounter deck being extremely hard and perhaps not allowing you to use your strong/thematic/fairly powerful/fun/interesting theme decks.   I have 6 decks built right now, each exploring different themes, combos, etc.  I get it.  But the quest is a difficulty of 8.  Noted as the highest they've given before.  I feel that to think that you should be able to beat this quest with mediocre decks is folly.  And to think that every quest should be designed to be beaten by these types of decks is also a folly.  Traps are my current favorite theme - that and Victory display stuff - but quests with "no attachments" or that include cards with printed victory values make my deck completely useless, even with cheesy Gandalf in the list.  It simply cannot beat any quest with those traits - regardless of it's difficulty rating - due to it being a complete counter to what I'm trying to do.  But I shouldn't expect it to either.  

 

I find it interesting that you are opposed to "resorting" to "easy mode" (man that was a marketing mistake to name it that), which is designed to lower the difficulty of a quest to make it less stressful, more enjoyable and allow for a broader range of deck builds but also apparently think resorting to Gandalf is cheesy and that you shouldn't have to make "top-teir" decks to beat the most difficult quest to date.  So it sounds like you want quests that you can beat with your decks and if they can't, it's too hard and bad design.  But that exact sentiment is why the other mode was created.  Just because your decks have done well up until now doesn't invalidate them somehow.  It just means they don't work against what this quest is doing and you either need to redesign your deck - or modify the quest itself and likely keep your decks they way are.  

 

I'd love it if the difficulty of quests stayed higher on a regular basis.   With the option of "easy mode" it honestly gives us the most versatility and replay-ability out of a quest.  If all the quests were 6+ in difficulty, I feel there would be a lot more acceptance of "easy mode" and it wouldn't have a stigma of being cheesy or somehow lesser play.  Then more of us would be inclined to play "easy mode" through quests with whatever types of decks we wanted.  Which can still provide a challenge without being too easy.  For those that like to use the "top tier" power house cards, this type of design still gives them a challenge without having to wait for the nightmare version of the quest.  It honestly is the best of both worlds.  to each their own and all that.

The marketeer in me knows that this is true. The idealist in me thinks people get too much 'you are a special snowflake' attitude from games. Half the gamers in the world are below average, deal with it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Not that you can hide easy mode being just that because you get the 'extra' resource. If you gave a player without knowledge the rules for easy mode as well as the cards for nightmare, they would probably name the three modes easy/normal/hard as well. If I could redesign the game I would go with easy (resource + removal of cards), normal (removal of cards), hard (original normal mode) and nightmare (nightmare packs).

 

I think one 'easy' quest and one 'super hard' quest per cycle is a good design choice. A little something for everyone and you can't please everybody in a coop game like this.

 

 

I'm looking foreward to getting this pack, if it's been haunting everyone, I want to see what the fuss is about! But since I just got whooped by the Siege of Cairn Androw three times in a row, I don't feel optimistic about my deck's chances.

> My point--the one I have been trying to get across--is that the quest may be difficult FOR YOU because you play with a specific style or strategy that the quest WAS DESIGNED to counter. The Dunland quests, in similar fashion, we're designed to counter a specific style, a style I happen to utilize. All my standard decks lost to those quests, but I just tried a different style and then I beat them. It was challenging and uncomfortable. I don't particularly like those quests, but I certainly don't feel like FFG did something wrong to me personally.
> 
> That is what I don't understand. Like, if you can't beat a quest with the type of deck you want to beat it with, then clearly the game designers did something wrong. It makes no sense. The designers have specifically said that they design the quests to counter player strategies. Isn't that what they are supposed to do?

> The complaining really annoys me because if I beat the quest and don't experiance your "injustice" then it must be because I cheated or because I'm using invalid strategies that should basically be considered cheating. I mean give me a break.

> Many people have beaten the quest, some even beat it easily, using a variety of strategies. The complaints are empirically wrong. When faced with this evidence, the complainers just double down and act like victims? Get over yourselves. Maybe you just need to keep evolving. The designers have no moral obligation to cater to your particular tastes or idea of what counts as a valid approach to deckbuilding. I just don't feel sorrow for you.

And a lot of people are complaining that this quest is badly designed, so you better stop doing maths when you clearly have no idea of how statistics work. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Yes, it is possible to beat this quest with combos that are broken, but that's not the sense of deckbuilding. If some people prefer to play with broken decks, it's their particular taste and I don't think the designers should cater that. Get over yourself, play nightmare mode, which is designed for players like you and for those who prefer to make the game a ton easier by using more than one core set.

 

IMO the game is going in a totally wrong direction ATM. I already said this in another thread, but I am seriously considering to stop investing money into this.

Who says the quest can only be beaten with broken combos? A plain as vanilla Aragorn Frodo Glorfindel deck does excellently. Some other trait-based decks do really well too, like Dwarves, Ents, or Dunedain.

## 290 [DukeWellington on December 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1956136)

Umm Seastan, clearly Aragorn/Frodo/Glorfindel counts as a broken combo, Glorfindel is already OP. Also Dwarves are OP and should never be played, unless you have enough self respect to not use Dain or any of the good dwarf cards. Ents are obviously OP. Have you seen Quickbeam? Only Dunedain is acceptable because they suck. But if you continue to make good decks with them then they will also be disqualified.

I apologize for the heavy use of sarcasm.

Okay, I think maybe one of the reasons people like PsychoRocka and myself are a little perturbed about this quest is because of multiplayer.  Psycho and I play multiplayer almost exclusively,  or when single player we do 2-handed.  

Solo play is the achilles heel of the encounter deck.   Whenever anybody posts a deck that is for single player, I generally sort of shrug and go "of course it's good,   it's for single player".   Single player is a type of Easy-mode, IMO.  I shouldn't have to explain why, but I will anyway.  I mean, since the core set and people figured out you could use Hannermarth Riversong to always know exactly what the encounter deck had in store for you on the upcoming turn and could always perfectly prepare for it... yeah.   Revealing only 1 card per turn means it is far harder for the encounter deck to combo with itself.   Carn Dum in particular is a perfect example,  dishing out shadow cards via treachery encounter cards and getting a flip on thaurdir is something that happens much more frequently in multiplayer, and if you aren't prepared for that each and every time it happens, you are dead.  Just the safety of only 1 encounter card per turn is a huge boon on this quest for solo players.

To me this is a game to play with friends.   If me and my friends are going to beat Carn Dum,   than not only do I have to bring a top tier deck,  but all of my friends also have to bring top tier decks, and none of them can use the same heros (or other unique cards) as me, or as each other.   And that makes this quest really, really brutal.

When you play multiplayer, you are supposed to build your decks around each to work properly. Just bringing top tier decks that have 0 synergy will rarely cut it, as the encounter deck usually has that synergy.

Well, thanks for naming some of the examples. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] You forgot to mention Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire though.

 

As I said, I play with one core set only. It makes deckbuilding way more interesting, but it doesn't allow for stuff like three copies of Celebrian's Stone or Feint or Steward of Gondor etc. The few decks of Seastan I have seen mostly rely on combos that I am not able use, as they rely on certain cards that I have only one or two copies of. So far that hasn't (and shouldn't!) been a problem, but with the last few quests it turned out to be a pain in the ass.

 

But thanks anyway for ignoring the part that all of the sudden a lot of players are complaining about Carn Dum, which empirically means that there is probably something wrong woith the game design. But hey, selective perception is a great way to improve life quality. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

That's not how empiricism works. The majority are not always correct. And 'a lot' is a really vague sample size in any case.

Besides which, through this thread there are also a fair number of people arguing that no, it's not bad design, suggesting that over the people here, views are actually pretty balanced.

And it's not like this is the first time they've released a quest which brutally smashes pre-existing decks and left everyone feeling like they're running at a brick wall trying to beat it. They tend to become more palatable over time, so why should this one be any different?

The very basic Frodo deck I keep mentioning works fine with a single core: http://goo.gl/RoziIx [http://goo.gl/RoziIx]. I think there are many other single core options out there, and part of the fun for me is finding them through successive failures at a quest. But I know not everyone likes that, which is why I post pretty much all my decks online. I know I've gotten a reputation for posting broken combos but most of my decks are not. The ones that are broken are just more memorable I think.

 

From a two player perspective I agree with John. You can't just bring two top tier decks together. They need to synergize.  And I've found that in two player it is possible to synergize the decks so that their combined power is anywhere from 0 to remove-the-encounter-deck-from-the-game. Nobody likes to play at either end of that spectrum, so just build your decks to synergize to the power level you are comfortable playing at.

I hope I will be able to check out on your Frodo deck. However, atm I am too busy to build a Dunedain deck that is going to be strong enough to beat most of the quests. I think I made a huge step forwards by finally including these Valor cards together with Tactigorn.

Just played Battle of Carn Dum and loved it! The best and most intense quest I've played so far in this game! I did do it with a Gandalf deck, but no Vilya or Elrond or allies costing more than 2 (bar a couple copies of Faramir). The power level was just right, and it felt like I was even with the encounter deck, almost like playing against a real opponent. I won on my fourth try, though the first two defeats were due to location lock (I really need to work on my shuffling :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) and the third one was just enemy after enemy after [cough]Orc Grunts[cough] after enemy.

Just for the record, I really enjoyed this quest even though it is exceptionally difficult. There are a lot of very important decision points in the first 4-5 rounds. For example, do you YOLO quest and ignore the Carn Dun Garrison or eat the threat and try and take him out? Once I had my ally army in place though the only real threat to me losing was by way of threating out which very nearly happened even with the favor of Valar. All in all I really enjoyed it.

First try on new year, with a pure Dunedain deck (Loragorn, Halbarad, Amarthuil) which is mostly the one Seastan proposed (i changed 10 cards IIRC). I won !!

As JTG81 writes, the whole game is your first 5 turns. When after turn 5 i had no enemies in staging area (except thraurdir offcourse), with two or three always engaged, and two Northern Trackers in play - with some other allies offcource), it seemed to go easy. Unfortunatelly none of my three Burning Brands ever appeared thus some shadow and doomed effects raised my threat more than i thought, but yet i won with threat on 49.

Loragorn was a beast with steward of gondor, two blood of numenor, two unexpected courage, sword that was broken and the tactics attachment (edit:I had event written which is wrong offcourse) that you discard a resource to add all other on your attack.

Cardboard of the rings beat this quest on their new year's stream, with a drunk Brandon as one of the three players.  I guess this quest isn't as hard as we thought.

Didn't they give themselves one extra starting resource per hero, though?

I didn't see it, but that's a huge boost if so.

They did, they played "sleazy mode," which is easy mode's +1 starting resource per hero but not removing the gold border cards.

That is a massive boost. Definitely a win on easy mode so doesn't really have any impact on how this quest is.

For the record, PsychoRocka, I put the latest versions of your decks into OCTGN, ran them up against Carn Dum and beat it.

Now, I'll admit I made a couple of slight retcons along the way when I realised I'd done something stupid, and I may have made a rules mistake or two somewhere. And even with those points it was a fairly nightmarish slog culminating in a combat round with two or three extra attack shadows, three undefended attacks killing Arwen and Elrond and putting four damage on Glorfindel where discarding a third different card type to the shadow effect would've meant death. Oh and the decks were at 49 and 48 threat.

BUT, the point is I won, and that having never used the decks before and with a lot of the stuff in this quest causing significant problems for them (Fortress Walls shut down the twins, Power of Angmar blocks Elven Light and Lords of the Eldar, etc). It's totally doable, but your decks are specifically countered by some of the stuff in this quest which really doesn't help.

You make it sound as if easy mode is not an officially supported mode of play.

Nice job Pocketwraith! After seeing your post this morning I decided to finally revisit this quest after my first go with at least 10 losses and my second go with no idea how many losses (ball park 4 or 5?) and managed to beat it at last on the second go today (after a restart on turn 3 the first attempt).

 

It was still an immense struggle throughout and I managed to pass 3 player side quests while building up an armada of allies and attachments (Cleared Send for Aid (netting Legolas ally and a Wellinghall Protector), Gather Information and Double Back). Two test of wills were crucial at certain moments as were a few sneak attack Gandalfs and two hardcasted ones as well.

Thaurdir is just a dirty rotten ******* and it will be a long time before I revisit this quest, he kept me on my toes all game and a fair few allies fell to his blade... I didn't get sentinel set up on Elrohir all game but managed to get burning brand on Elrond (as well as unexpected courage) and two wardens of healing out eventually so both decks could safely defend against Thaurdir when need be.

Orc Ambush side quest was downright brutal and I picked out the lowliest orc enemies I could find but still struggled against it, I did clear it the turn after it appeared however (probably would have lost if I did not clear it this quickly..).

So glad I did not get any other nasty encounter side quests and it was hard enough to clear the three player ones.

Once I got play down to simply Thaurdir in play and whatever would appear each turn (and be cleared within a turn or two at most) I was ready to go to stage 2 and had just finished clearing the third player side quest as well. I got to stage 2 and beat it pretty quickly. I managed to beat it without losing any heroes as well somehow.

 

I got extremely lucky in both my player card draws, side quest effects (getting Legolas and the 3 willpower Ent from Send for Aid was incredibly beneficial) encounter draws and even shadow effects and capitalized on this grinding out my eventual first win against this quest.

I made a mistake at one point (not flipping Thaurdir back at the end of the round whilst on stage 1 and dealing an additional shadow to each enemy in play) but noticed before it was irreversible and managed to fix the error and play on.

It was an incredibly long game and I definitely dragged out how long I was on stage 1 as long as possible.

Happy with the result and glad I can progress past this quest now but still of the opinion it is a crappy quest.

Simply too hard for something that is not at least a nightmare or gencon quest and in a way that is not fun or exciting but just overly punishing, time consuming and annoying. Eager to get my hands on Dread Realm not only for the quest but so that I can stop using proxies of Arwen and Elven Light!
Oh I managed to play Lindir at a point where I had no other cards in hand getting me three cards, that was a random highlight!

Didn't mean it like that so my bad. Easy mode is fine for those who use it but does not really compare to normal mode (that is the entire concept, it is EASY mode) so a game played on easy isn't really of much use when judging how hard a particular quest is considering the vast majority of people play on normal.

Phew, finally got the last two quests and this one is a beast! Played three games against it to get a feeling of what I'm facing, then did some sideboard action to modify my Dúnedain trap deck. Won first time but made some play errors (mostly not in my favour but still). Tried it again a few times until I got a second win.

 

Definately harder than Cair Andros imo. But that quest is very anti-trap while this quest can be won with traps. Basically I tried to get three forest snares out as quick as possible, then used a Burning Branded Aragorn to block Thaurdir, Favor of the Valar to survive quest 2a and basically got the entire encounter deck stuck as shadow cards. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I shudder to think what kind of beastly deck you need to win without such tricks!

 

But wow, there are a LOT of ways you can get crushed here! Even in Solo there are soo many combos! Flippin' Thaurdir! I do play it the right way right? If Thaurdir (captain) has 2 shadow cards, and a card effect causes him to flip, he'll prepare to attack, get a third shadow card, attack, flip back (from receiving the 3rd shadow card), then give himself another shadow card. And if one of his first shadow cards is an Orc Grunts, he'll go down to 2 shadow cards after his attack then when he flips to captain and get's a third one he'll attack again right?

 

Good on CotR to win with easy mode! I think hard quests with easy mode are still very hard.

Finally had a chance to play this quest a few times last night.  Geez, it is hard!  Definitely the hardest non-NM quest in the game.  First I tried it with some of my stock decks and got crushed (Erestor = loss in this quest).  Tried it with some paired decks using Legolas and Haldir, but Thaudir kept making unexpected attacks against my ranged deck.  Finally I broke down and played it solo with a Glorfindel, Elrond, Treebeard deck with a Seastan strategy I normally avoid (Good Harvest + Steward).  Got LoV, Good Harvest, and Steward on the first turn and pulled off a very long victory.  It's hard to kill more than one enemy per turn, but it seemed like I would often get 2 or 3. 

 

I love the quest design, but I would have liked it to be a little bit easier.  I like to have a little flexibility with my deck design instead of being to required to completely focus on the specific quest.

So, it turns out if you accidentally use the Cursed Dead encounter set instead of Foul Sorcery, this quest is still brutal. Oops!

Well, playing with the correct card set, we won at the second attempt. We only had to make small changes to our decks (mono-lore Trap/Elrond [removed Rossiel and added Haldir], spirit/tactics Rohan with added Haldir-friendly attachments).

 

Not sure I particularly like it, though. It is hard and also complicated, there was a lot to remember and it's very easy to make mistakes.

FINALLY beat this quest using a straight up Silvan solo deck, Galadriel-Celeborn-Haldir. It took a while, my army got wiped like 3 times, but I always managed to get reinforcements and in the end it took me 2 rounds to beat stage 2. I wasn't even running Sneak Attack Gandalf and I just had 1 copy of Steward (which thankfully I drew mid-game): I feel very satisfied.

I finally caught up to you all and had my first chance at playing this scenario the other day.

 

I agree there was a lot to remember.

 

I don't play solo but I can see why this quest would be quite difficult solo.  I played with one of my friends and we used Dwarves and Elrond as we usually do.  We didn't run into too much trouble, although I can see why it would be hard.  My deck got going and fortunately I was able to get all my Erebor Record-keepers, Erebor Hammersmiths, and Miner of the Iron Hills into play before any single copy got discarded.  This made it much less risky to defend due to that one nasty shadow effect.

 

I did lose Dain near the end because I didn't realize there was a shadow card that got +1 for each ally I controlled lol.  +15 hurts a lot :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]  I could have just chump blocked, too but I didn't want to risk defending with someone that might die.  I didn't think there was a risk of Dain (with 4 defense, and 6 health) dying to a weak little Orc...

OMFG, I finally beat this quest playing 2-handed solo after a ridiculous number of tries. Granted, a lot of those were brought upon myself, since at the start I was trying to beat it with offbeat decks like an untuned Erestor one. And then I refused to use A Burning Brand for a while. (I have some weird aversion to that particular card.)

 

Until tonight. I sat down and busted out the OP cards: Gandalf/Glorfindel/Galadriel on one hand, Elrond/Lore Faramir/Mirlonde on the other. Wait, Lore Faramir? Well, yes, as has been mentioned a couple of times before, he's actually quite good in this quest with all those high-threat enemies clogging up the staging area. Mirlonde was just for starting threat purposes, as always with her.

 

I had a near-ideal start, with the Steward of Gondor/Good Harvest combo AND Light of Valinor AND Shadowfax AND A Test of Will. But of course it soon turned into a desperate slog, including an amazing surge-fest of Heavy Curse, Orc Grunts, Orc Grunts, Orc Grunts (!), Heavy Curse, Angmar Orc. (I politely declined the Angmar Orc's offer of another encounter card.) Through Gandalf shenanigans I would manage to use nearly every single Spirit event at my disposal: A Test of Will x3, Shadows Give Way x3, Hasty Stroke x2, Elrond's Counsel x3. I had the Warden heal about a million damage overall. I got Ethir Swordsman x3 and Nenya out and kept them there. I even perfectly timed my single copy of Mirkwood Pioneer.

 

And it STILL came down to the wire, every resource gone, full damage on heroes (the live ones, at least, as Mirlonde and Galadriel would fall to Thaurdir in the last round). The only thing that saved me, in fact, was a shadow effect bouncing an enemy back to the staging area, which boosted Faramir juuust enough for this:

 

- 1st player declares attack against Thaurdir with Gandalf and Glorfindel for 6ATK, piercing Thaurdir's 4DEF for 2 damage.

- Shadowfax readies Gandalf.

- 2nd player declares attack with Faramir, ally Treebeard, and Shadowfax'ed Gandalf (thank the designers that this cheese works) for 11ATK, getting Thaurdir for the exact 7 more damage needed to kill him.

 

The only other times I've felt so much accomplishment from beating a quest were for Into Ithilien and Helm's Deep. What the hell is the nightmare version going to be? Flip Thaurdir every time an encounter card is revealed?

Congratulations! I've made it my personal goal to beat this quest with a generalist Leadership Tactics Dúnedain deck, and i've gotten very close quite a few times, but I fear it will take a while before I actually score the win.

 

Seems like you got a good power team. Had you considered Haldir instead of Faramir, since he can attack into the staging area? Anyway, good win for you. I love that moment in this game where you finally beat a super difficult quest that had you stomped for a long time.

I love Haldir, but I was pretty set on the idea of mono-Lore for deep-dig draws, and Haldir is orders of magnitude better when he's got some Tactics weapons. In retrospect, I guess I had A Good Harvest x3 in the deck anyway, so it wouldn't have been crazy to throw in his weapons too. Or even put them in the pseudo-mono-Spirit Gandalf deck.

I think I just wanted to use Lore Faramir for once. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] It's very satisfying to have him hit for 6 (ranged!) without needing an attachment.

Just saw this video and it made me think of this thread:

 





 

Seastan beat Carn Dum with 2 decks, revealing 3 cards per turn instead of 2!

 

I really think Boromir needs an errata to limit 5 times per turn, a la treebeard. If he can trivialize each quest this badly, there's something wrong.

Yep. I've always said that Boromir is much OP than Glorfindel.

Glorfindel is great is you play nightmare quests in pure solo and want to start with a low threat.

Played this quest today for the 1st time ever, with a Super Bilbo [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/319/rajam-super-bilbo-v3-3-1.0] deck. Although I managed to earn a victory, I can see why this quest gets so much hate (and love)... the amount of shadow cards around was ridiculous. I almost threat out in the early stages, but dropping in Gandalfs like crazy every round helped me to deal with it, and once Bilbo gets setup he laughs at all enemies around, even Thaurdir. This quest is clearly designed to challenge the best decks around; I'm not sure if I'd dare to test a novelty or a "good-but-not-broken" deck in here. It also left a good taste in my mouth, as someone who likes to use top tier decks and cards to their maximum potential, it's cool to stand against encounter decks at par.

 

I definitely need to play this more times, although I think Escape from Dol Guldur (solo) is still harder.
