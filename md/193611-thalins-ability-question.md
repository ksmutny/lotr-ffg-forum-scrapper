I have a question about Thalin's ability

 

Does it occur before or after the Surge, Doomed keywords?

Before. So, basically Thalin destroys Eastern Crows as soon as they are revealed. It's in the FAQ (pag 6):

 

When an enemy card is revealed from the encounter deck, Thalin’s ability resolves before any keyword or “When Revealed” card effects on the encounter card.
