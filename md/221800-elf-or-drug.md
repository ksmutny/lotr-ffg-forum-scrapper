I got 26 out of 30.

## 3 [Kakita Shiro on June 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221800-elf-or-drug/?do=findComment&comment=2251219)

Only 21.

23/30, but done almost purely by "feeling". I only read tolkien once :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

29! There were a few drug names that gave me pause though... Valchor could be Sindarin, but it sounds too evil to be an elf.

23 but quite a few were based upon linguistic sounds that Tolkien rarely used for elves yet drugs often do, also a few prefix or suffixes were such as used in some drugs.... so basically I'm saying I knew about 7 of the 23 I got right lol

Ask your doctor if Glorfindel is right for you. Side effects may include long, flowing golden hair, spontaneous prophesying, or coming back from the dead.

29, and I haven't even read the Silmarillion.

26.. some real obscure elves in there!

## 13 [Nickpes on June 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221800-elf-or-drug/?do=findComment&comment=2252132)

27, but one of my mistakes was totally unacceptable ...

## 14 [DurinVoronwe on June 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221800-elf-or-drug/?do=findComment&comment=2252266)

29 for someone who haven´t ready the History of Middle-Earth.

## 15 [Chris85 on June 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221800-elf-or-drug/?do=findComment&comment=2252530)

28 but I think I did well based on drug knowledge aposed to elf

## 16 [Hawkstrike on June 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221800-elf-or-drug/?do=findComment&comment=2253020)

26, and kicking myself over the few I missed. Tolkien's linguistic tics are giveaways.

27, not bad for someone who had never heard of any of those drugs before.

(I'm only a teenager. Come on.)

This teenager haven´t heard of the any of drugs, but love Tolkien. To be a teenager is not a excuse for not knowing Tolkien well enough (I didn´t do know Tolkien well enough, so maybe will Mandos spare you (but not me)).

Don´t get me wrong, 27 is really good.

## 19 [Supertoe on June 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221800-elf-or-drug/?do=findComment&comment=2253878)

This teenager knows nothing about drugs, and hasn't read silmarillion. I'll take the test later and see.

I have read Silmarillion (and Book of Lost Tales a while back).

Apparently I do not belong here as I have the lowest score with a 20

I thought you at least have read the Silmarillion, as your signature is a quote form one of my favourite moments. Did you forget Unfinished Tales or haven´t you read it? Well, I think I was wrong and you right. If I know something about the valar, Mandos will spare you (but still not me).

## 24 [Ecthelion III on June 7, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221800-elf-or-drug/?do=findComment&comment=2255916)

I haven't had the opportunity to read Unfinished Tales yet, as my small county library doesn't have it. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Only 19. I am fail.

My wife got 18, so cheer up! :-)

I am also a teen who knows about as much about drugs as he does about women (im a guy by the way).  basically, none. anyway, I got 25 with a little bit of tolkien knowlegde and understanding of how his words work.  not many Vs, Xs, or Ws, at least not as first letters.  It also helps to know how the quizing system works in that it wont have a single outcome more than two or maybe three times in a row.  anyway thx, that was fun!

This thread makes me feel old. And I'm not even that old.

29

only a few were questionable. the linguistic pattern is quite simple.
