On this day, Frodo and Bilbo Baggins share a birthday.  Celebrate by not getting them killed by trolls!

Also the date Saruman arrived in the Shire, as did the Nazgul a year prior.

Had to sign in for this one, not having missed to celebrate this day since I had learned about it.

Many Happy Returns, Bilbo and Frodo!

I had a second portion at lunch and I didn't even realize what I was celebrating. Happy Birthday, Baggins Boys.

i do really love his ally version in almost any Spirit deck. 2 for 2 questing and more than 1 measly hit point? you, sir, have earned yourself a deckslot.
