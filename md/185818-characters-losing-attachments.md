# [Characters losing attachments](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185818-characters-losing-attachments/)

So I have a quick rules question I should probably know, but oddly has never come up.

A character has both "dunedain signal" (gains sentinel) and "the days rising" (attach to a character with sentinel) attached.

During combat a shadow card effect forces the character to discard a non objective attachment. "Dunedain Signal" is discarded. Is "the day's rising" discarded as well? The character would no longer have sentinel, but would that only matter for purposes of attachment?

Thanks for any help.

The play restriction "attach to a character with sentinel" only matters (gets checked) when playing the attachment.  After it is already attached, it does not matter anymore if the character loses the 'sentinel' ability.  The attachment will stay.

Ah ok that's what's I thought. I appreciate the response.
