 Okay it seems I have found a way too broken combo. You play Sneak Attack and put Gandalf into play and his effect resolves. You did that during the questing phase so you also commit him to a quest. After the whole quest phase he is back in your hand and up for further use and all this for only 1 resource.

Sick???

Cheers,

 I must apologise. It seems that plueschi did an awesome job and already covered some gruesome combos. Thanks to you kind sir ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
