 Any of you other Tolkien fans feel the same way?  This game is incredibly fun, and challenging, and I am so eager to own more of these cards set in the beautiful world of Middle Earth.

After my addictive run-in with Magic: The Gathering, CCG's are something I avoid at all costs. If LOTR LCG had had a delivery scheme similar to that I wouldn't have purchased it.

That being said, I see where you are coming from. I cannot wait for the first adventure pack. This is my favorite game right now.

Oddly enough for me, as someone who usually when I get a new game, plays it to death right off the bat, LotR has been on the slow-burner (under 10 plays in 2 months of owning, unheard of for me). It'll pick up now that I finally ditched the starter decks and made four 50 card decks, but it does feel lacking something. Not sure what, but I'm not getting the "must play, must play" feel from LotR that I usually get from new games preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif] .

Exact opposite here. Much more fun than other card and board games in the past. The only one I used to be addicted to was Magic but this IS much more enjoyable - as it is Tolkien. Of course, it is early now, but so far SO good!

I don't know, could be Meccg spoiled me as to what a truely superb Middle-Earth game is like. Had some of the same elements, but so much more you could do in that one.
