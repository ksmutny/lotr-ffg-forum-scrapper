It depends on the event card.  If it says "Response" you can play it when the thing it is responding to happens, for example playing Test of Will when an encounter card with a "When Revealed" is revealed.

If the event card says "Action" you can play it in any action window.  Look at the Turn Sequence in pages 30-31 of the core set rule and you'll see a lot of green and red -- you can play actions at any time in the green parts, and not at all in the red parts.

A few event cards specify a particular phase, such as Feint saying "Combat action".  This can only be played in the named phase, and can only be played during the green parts of the phase.

Do you buy the card at the planning stage and leave it till needed, or buy it as time requires?

Cheers!

You pay for it at the time you play and resolve the card.
