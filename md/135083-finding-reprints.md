I'm new to the game and so far have the core set and the Shadows of Mirkwood AP. I'm nearly finished with those and so I'm wanting to pick up Khazad-Dum and the Dwarrowdelf AP next. I noticed that those were recently reprinted and my understanding is that the reprints usually have some upgrades that the older versions don't (errata updates, easy mode identifiers). Is there a way for me to distinguish a reprinted copy versus an older copy from looking at the box? I'm primarily wanting to just make sure as much of the errata information is on the cards as possible so I don't forget something. Thanks.

Not sure. I think the copyright years might be updated...

The lower right corner of the UPC has four digits, a month, and a year. Not sure what the four digits are, but the month and year are when it was printed. Not in stores but printed. You would be looking for something towards the middle of 2014

Great! Must have missed that when I was looking at them last week. Thanks for the tip.
