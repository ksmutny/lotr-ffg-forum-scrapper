Anyone know of a good place to buy single cards for this game? I really don't want to have to buy two more core sets just to complete my collection. :/

theres been many threads on this- general idea is you cant….well technically you can, they will just cost you about $10 or £s or whatever for a couple as ffg dont release singles so the only way for people to sell them is split a core pack!

Last I checked, none of them were married…but I have had to separate Legolas and Beravor a few times…

Thanks for the response. That sucks. I had hoped some online retailer would have broken up a core set or something. :/
