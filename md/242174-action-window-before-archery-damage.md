Archery damage happens at the beginning of the combat phase. Is there an action window before the archery damage though? This is relevant, for example, with Tactics Imrahil ability, because you could put the damage tokens on the allies Imrahil brings to the table (and that would disappear at the end of the combat phase anyways)

There is not.
