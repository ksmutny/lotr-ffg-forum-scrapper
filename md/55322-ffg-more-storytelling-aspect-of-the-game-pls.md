# [FFG: More storytelling aspect of the game pls.](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55322-ffg-more-storytelling-aspect-of-the-game-pls/)

Aside from the challenging mechanic of the card game, I also enjoy the theme and the game story. I would love it if the game feels like a roleplaying game too. My suggestions are:

1. Include a map of relevant areas of the Middle Earth with the expansion or adventure pack. Looking at the map allows players like me to visualize where we are adventuring/questing. I was particularly thrilled when I saw a map in the LotR novel (not included in the game) and saw in it Old Forest Road, Anduin River, Mirkwood Forest. A map of where the adventure takes place immerses the players more. A map of the relevant area could be included at the bottom part of the rules insert (instead of the big artwork) included with the adventure packs.

2. In the rules insert for the adventure packs, maybe adding a few more paragraphs about the ongoing story could help increase the storytelling aspect of the game. Right now, just a few sentences are included.

3. Instead of card's flavor texts (which are very hard to read due to very small font size), maybe FFG could put some descriptive narrative (especially in location cards), that would make the players reading them feel that they are in the game, adventuring. I like the narrative that appears on the quest cards.

Adding these small changes are feasible. They won't take anything away from the game. Players looking for theme and story would enjoy them. I hope FFG would consider my suggestions.

1 - Please do not do this. a card game like this produces enough superfluous crap with out adding fluff maps. If you included this on the back of the rule sheet, I guess that would be cool... but not a separate bit of paper. You know I think the best place for this would be the games website, were people can look at it and you can continually add new dots on the maps that on mouse over open the card...

2 - I completely agree on this point, but I want to go a step further. One of the awesome things about CoC packs is that each packs has a professionally written short story on it, and it is serialized in each pack, so once you have the set you have the entire short story.. I LOVE this and really wish LoTRs did that as well.

3 - I see no need for this.. I mean where would you put this stuff? There is little room as is. Nor do i think it would add much, if anything.

1. It's certainly easy enough to find a map online of Middle-Earth, not to mention that the location cards in the scenarios serve just as well as any map.

2. This would be great but I enjoy the way I play through the quest becoming my own individual, lived-out story.

3. The flavor text does do this. Besides, there isn't any room for that much info. It's easy enough to match the flavor text on the card with the contextual reference from the books. I'd say 95% of the flavor text is spot on in context.

"Superfluous crap"?  Just chalk it up to different gaming tastes.  Some like the competitive/challenging aspect of the game, some like the theme and the story. Looking at the rules insert that comes with the adventure packs, at the bottom portion of the insert, the artwork is just a space filler.  Maybe, FFG could use a portion of that for a location specific map of say, Carrock and its environs.  No need for an extra sheet or page. Most of the casual gamers don't go to the game manufacturer's website, let alone look for a map of the game.  Although it's also a good idea to have a map on this website, I think it's still a good idea to have a small map, maybe at the bottom portion of the rules insert.  After all, FFG said the future adventure packs/cycles  would focus on different areas of Middle earth. What better way to tie in all those together than a map?

The location cards don't have shadow effects and thus might have some room. Instead of the occasional flavor text, maybe a brief description could be used (what feeling this location gives to the heroes, etc).  I'm not saying do this for all cards or locations.  Just some where space permits.  Bigger fonts for card text would be appreciated too (bad eye sight makes it hard for me to read small fonts).

I still think that these little additions won't detract from the game.  For those who don't like it, then they just ignore it.  But for those who enjoy these little things, the game would just get better for us.

 The map idea sounds fine. I'm all for a bit of story fluff it is one of the things I love about some of the tabletop games rule books. I don't think adding anything else to the printed cards is needed though. They struggle to fit what they currently have on the cards some times. Look at the unique troll cards they should really have Victory Points on them but where would you fit it on the card.

I love this idea.  Thumbs up from me.  Sounds like a great way to make the game more enjoyable for many people.aplauso.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/aplauso.gif]

Time to sound like a ******...

FFG does a wonderful job doing exactly what they do. The flavor text and stories they supply already fill every niche you wanted. Typically someone who has never read the books and wants things spoon fed to them would ask for the things you are. They tend to be Fanboys of the movies.

Everything you are asking for is already included in all of the books. FFG highlights the tidbits they do because they assume people who play this game are actual fans and have read and watched everything there is about the LotR/ The Hobbit/The Silmarillion. They assume we have a good memory and that these nuggets they provide, allow us to reflect fondly on what has already been provided.

FFG is not trying to really tell a story but to highlight, and to an extent create, snapshots of the world  that captivate our attention.

Of course this is my assumption of why they do what they do and you could assume I am an ass as I have made many assumptions about your post. All I am trying to say, ultimately, is that FFG is doing awesome.

  FFG is way ahead of you! If you look on the location cards of the encounter deck there is a map of middle earth behind the text on each card.  Personally that is one of my favorite parts of the cards. I'm a geography major and like maps so I would totally go with your idea of having maps included with the rule sheet that would be great! I don't know about doing anything more to the cards I think they are fine the way they are, but they had already predicted your plea for maps and put them on the location cards.
