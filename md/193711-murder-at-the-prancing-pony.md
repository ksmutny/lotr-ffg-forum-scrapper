I think I will need a second pair of brains on this one, just in case I have missed something.

 

This is a Whodunnit-quest where everyone is gathering clues as to who did not do it, using process of elimination to find the culprit and the location.

 

Does this mean, as per table-talk rules, that the players cannot divulge any or all information they themselves have gathered?

 

When it is time to make The Guess - it notes that players should make it, hinting at it being a collective process.

 

Do they gather their notes at that time and break the tabletalk rule, or is it still everyone for themselves?

 

This is a pretty big part of the quest and I am sure the info is out there but I have just missed it.

 

Thanks in advance.

We had this question come up at our Fellowship event.  We decided it was intended for the players to share information (it would be very impossible to legitimately discover the identities of the Suspect and Hideout cards).  And for some text to back us up, we looked at this text from the rules cards: 

 

"During the game, players should check enemies and locations off of their Investigation list"

 

There is only one Investigation list (the checklist on the rules card).  All players share it, so all players are able to see which Suspects and Hideouts have been checked off.

I have a question about the Prancing Pony set to make sure I am playing it properly.

 

The Village Stable has "Response: After triggering the Investigate keywork on Village Stable, if the looked at card is a Suspect or a Hideout, add Village Stable to the victory display to add that card to the staging area."

 

As I understand it Responses are optional, so this doesn't have to happen...  But why would I want it to happen?  Those Suspects and Hideouts are pretty potent, is this just a way to step up the difficulty if you choose?

It's a way to thin out the investigation deck.  In a recent game I chose not to use that Response on one of the Hideouts, but regretted that decision later as the same Hideout kept coming up again and again during our attempts at investigation.

It increases the probability that on future Investigates that you find information that you did not yet have.

It also adds the Village Stable to the victory display, lowering cost of keen as lances, allowing you to cancel it with door is closed or giving Rossiel a willpower boost against future copies. I found the stable was particularly nasty because of it's travel cost, so I think this is also a legitimate reason to use the response.

After exploring the Prancing Pony and looking at the top two cards of the Investigation deck, does the Investigation deck get shuffled?

I do not think you do.  The only time you shuffle the investigation deck is as a part of resolving the Investigate key word.

No, you shuffle the Investigation deck before you look at it.

This is not entirely accurate, but in most cases is true.  You only shuffle the investigation deck when resolving "Investigate".  You are allowed to look at the bottom card with certain effects and you are allowed to look at the top two cards when you clear the Prancing Pony.  Neither of these effects are from resolving "Investigate" so you would not shuffle before looking at the cards in the investigation deck in these cases.

I love this quest!

Finally I have just beat it in solo with a very thematic deck  :-D

with Aragorn (Lore), Frodo, Merry (Spirit)

Just a question, to be sure:

for this quest card (side 3A)

http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Apprehending-the-Killer-MatPP [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Apprehending-the-Killer-MatPP]

In the text "When Revealed: Each player besides the first player searches the encounter deck and..."

the word "besides" refere to all other player except the first, is it correct?

In a game with two players only the second player should search the encounter deck, right?

I believe you are correct.  I would definitely interpret as "all players other than the first player".
