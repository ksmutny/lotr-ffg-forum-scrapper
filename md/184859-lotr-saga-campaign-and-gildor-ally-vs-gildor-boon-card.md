Sorry if this has been asked before, I am looking for it for some hours and cannot find anything, though I think there was a mention

 

I am about to start the LotR Saga with a friend. On the first Saga box there is a Gildor Inglorion boon card. What happens if I want to include Gildor Lore ally on my deck?

If boon Gildor is in play, you won't be able to play Lore Gildor-- I suppose you can put him in your deck, but you can't play him.  If Lore Gildor is in play and then boon Gildor is revealed from the encounter deck, you would just discard the boon.  Old ruling is in a thread here [https://boardgamegeek.com/article/13683412#13683412].

 

And text quoted below:

 

"The unique rules for the game prevent the objective ally from entering play at that point because you already have Gildor in play. That means the Gildor objective ally will be discarded with no effect.

Hope you're enjoying The Black Riders!
Cheers,
Caleb"
