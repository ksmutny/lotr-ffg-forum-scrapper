If you have been watching the goings on for the World Championship weekend in November, FFG has put up that there will be an event happening on that Sunday.  Nothing has been announced but it may signal that one of the two products set to come out in Q4 may be released or previewed in Roseville.  It also may be a unique quest.

I'm going so my guess that it will be the second Saga Hobbit expansion.  Log in with your hope!

Actually it would be rather heirs of numenor its now on boat. 2nd saga is still in development. But maybe that will just introduce some kind of tournament rules?

 

Anyway there is no info that event would include LOTR :<

Just make sure that anyone who gets to attend gets back on here ASAP and give us the low down! (please…)

The announcement today makes it clear that there apparently will not be a new product.  Have to admit I am a little dissapointed.

"During The Lord of the Rings Fellowship Event, players will face new dangers in the Mirkwood. You’ll work together with friends and strangers as you return to the dark and tangled woods and undertake new adventures."

Sounds like new POD to me !!

"new dangers" and "new adventures" couldn't mean anything else…

And pictures name is "ambush-on-the-shore.png"…

 It was mentioned somewhere before. They will introduce gamenight kits which will give you a game mat and new cards to add to existing quests to make them challenging again. Some think it could be weather cards or something similar.

 

We will know in a few weeks.

does anyone remember that announcement that was made at GENCON -- "Game night kits for LOTR LCG to include new cards to ramp up the difficulty of classic scenarios". From reading the article it sounds like this must be it, because they say "it’s a chance for players to discover frightening new surprises in an area they may have once considered fully explored"

 

[Edit: just noticed muemakan said exactly the same thing, sry!]

Totally agree. Everyone must to bring a encounter sets from the core box. So there is will be some additional encounter cards for every encounter set from core box. Its mean you can play entire SOM cycle with new challenge. Sounds very good. Hope we can buy those cards after?

i hope they don't just add a few new enemies and treacheries to each quest, because that wont be very long-lasting. we'll just play the quests a few times with the new cards, and then they will go straight back into the cupboard again.

what they need to do is make a small group of cards which are quest-independant, and can be dropped into the old ones, and all the future one too, to make them play different.

 I hope they keep up the amazing work with these new cards and then put them on PoD for everyone that can't attend as usual :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
