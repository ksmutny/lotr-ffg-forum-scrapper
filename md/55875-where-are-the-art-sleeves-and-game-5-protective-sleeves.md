 I want to sleeve my LotR cards using the neat Art Sleeves with Gimli and Gandalf on them. They were due out this past summer and they're still not in stock anywhere!  So, I thought I would just get the plain clear Fantasy Flight "5" Protective Sleeves advertised on the LotR:Card Game box, but they aren't even making those yet!  Where are all the sleeves for this game?

I just use dragonsheild sleeves. Gold for player decks, silver for heroes and red for encounter deck  and clear for quest cards. They are made in Denmark and are of the highest quality. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

They have definitetly been on sale because I picked up about 7 packs around the time the original box set was released (UK) but since then they have been really scarce. I've only seen the coloured sleeves in shops - last look was in London in Orc's Nest and Forbidden Planet.

I was also waiting for the art sleeves - for sets like the Game of Thrones LCG they have been released, so I am hopeful we will see them some day.

Those are exactly what I mean!  They've been out of stock for a long time now...  I have some preordered along with Return to Mirkwood and Khazad-Dum for Christmas. If both of those are released and my order doesn't ship before Christmas because they're still waiting on the card sleeves to be released, I'm going to be a little irate...

 I was on Amazon last night looking to see if they had Khazad-Dum available for preorder.

I did not find it, but they did have two sets of LotR art sleeves available.
