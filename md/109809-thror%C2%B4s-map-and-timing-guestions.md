So first, if i use Thror´s map, do i have to resolve chosen location´s travel effect?

 

And second guestion is concering about that, if example fat spider would attack me and then shadow card would give me 1 poison, can i use sneak attack + miner of the ironhills to remove that condition attachment, before fat spider resolves it´s attack?

Thror's Map doesn't say to travel to that location, so Travel effect is ignored.

Poison are condition and the effect of fat spider is a passive, also you have an action window after resolving the shadow effect and before calculating the damage. So it's perfectly legal.
