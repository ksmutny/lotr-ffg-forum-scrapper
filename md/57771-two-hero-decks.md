 Has anyone attempted to make or play with two-hero decks at all yet? Supposedly it's possible, but the resource acquisition detriment seems impossible to deal with unless you're heavy in Leadership. Is it worth playing with?

I have been thinking about this myself.The rules say you can use 3 at max, so in theory you can use 1 Hero. Still I can not really see any reason to do so. I think this rule is a allowance that they have put in the rules to give them the freedom to add other mechanics in future packs. Say they make a new keyword or a new something that suddenly makes you want to run less Heroes. Still for now I just can not see any reason to not run 3 heroes.

 One reason is to begin with a lower threat value. But I'm ok, it is often better to begin with 3 heroes.

That is what happens at the start of the Dol Guldur scenario, and we know it is practically impossible to win solo. You could manage an easier scenario though.

 I could imagine a two Hero deck with Boromir as one of the heroes. The lower starting threat means you can feel more free to raise threat to ready him more often.

Up on BGG there's a session report of a 1-Hero win; Aragorn tackling Passage through Mirkwood on his own.

I was wrong though, it was done with Theodred not Aragorn.
