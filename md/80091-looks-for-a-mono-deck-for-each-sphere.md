So I have 2 cores and all the expansions, in looking to build 4 mono decks, one for each sphere,  so that my friends and I can play together as I try to coerce them to get in the game.  Any suggestions?

 

or conversely, are there  multi sphere decks i could possibly build?

There are some very good ones over at Tales From the Cards, at least for Leadership and Lore.
