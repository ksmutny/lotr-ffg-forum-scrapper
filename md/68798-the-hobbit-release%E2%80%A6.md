Wait, what!? That is fast, much sooner than I expected. Time to pre-order then.

Great news!  Though we had best here something about the release of new product for Gen Con.

I just talked to a store about pre-ordering this, since the 17th is so close, but the distributor dosen't expect it until sometime in September.  I'm thinking that the 17th is a limited release at Gen Con only.

Bummer…

ive had it on pre order for about 3 weeks- my store is excellent as they allow you to pre order it as soon as they get wind of what its called….still doesnt mean it will be out soon though

 Rich,

There are some online places that I've done some pretty early pre-ordering with before, but I wanted to start supporting my local game store more.

What bummed me out was his distributor, who said it probably wont even come to U.S. port until September.

I would just prefer it was released now. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I just moved to an area with a local game shop (a really good one). Spoke with the owner and the main associate. Real great guys who like the hobby and want to share it with others. Gaming any time of day, every day of the week (more organized play in evenings and weekend afternoons/evenings). I decided I'd be making at least every other purchase from these guys (regardless of prices; most things sell at list, I haven't really seen sales), just to try keep them around and doing what they are doing. SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL SHOPS (if you're lucky enough to have them, and the guys aren't jerks) !!!

i've started to do the same, problem is, i can find it online cheaper (even with shipping!). i tell myself that i'm still support a local business…just not in my locality. i did pick up S&F locally though, as my usual online shop wasn't shipping it in their usual timely manner.

Yeah I hear you. Obviously I don't mean to suggest that I could tell folks what to do, but, for those of us who take advantage of it, local shops provide a tremendous service, and if we don't support them, others won't (I'm still too new to boardgaming to tell if the hobby is growing or not, but I get the sense it's not growing much if it is). At any rate I find every other purchase (and accessories) to be a decent compromise for me. Also, in the US anyway, if you buy local, your sales tax goes back to your community not someone else's (although I suppose most online retailers don't have sales tax).

When I got in to the game all of Mirkwood, Khazad-dum and a couple of Dwarrowdelf packs were out. The money saved online seemed pretty big. Now that I am making my buys one at a time, I want to buy things locally. The extra 3/4 dollars doesn't bother me, and I like the atmosphere of the game stores.

Dain- Where is the shop you bought yours from? The place I was going to only has the core and first three of Mirkwood.

i get everything from miniaturemarket.com. the APs are $9.72 (add shipping to this and it's still less than full retail price), The Hobbit is in the neighborhood of $19. If you spend over $100, shipping is free (they really should give me a free pack for the plug! haha). If it's a local purchase, it's Game Depot in Tempe, a really great store.

Miniaturemarket actually just relocated to my town. I go to one of the other game shops (because miniaturemarket gets enough online business).
