Cancel them before they attach (Eleanor, Denthor, Strength of Will, etc), or make good friends with the Miner of the Iron Hills.

The Lore ally Miner of the Iron Hills (from the Core Set) is the best solution. His response effect allows you to discard a Condition attachment when he enters play. Since Caught in a Web counts as a Condition when it attaches to a hero, the Miner can dispose of it. He's also the best answer to Sacked! in Conflict at the Carrock.

An alternate strategy is to attach the Web to a hero who has alternate ways to ready himself, such as Aragorn. It still costs 1 resource token, but it is cheaper.

yea, or UC works as well, it just stops readying in the refresh phase. So card effects that ready it still work. But yes at the moment thee is only one card, the miner, that can discard conditions. Your best bet as Bohemond said is to control the encounter deck with the vast amount of cancels or skry abilities to just make sure you never draw them, or if you do you can cancel them.

As far as I know, you may use any alternate way to ready your hero other than the "natural" refresh way. Thus you could attach 2 Webs on Aragorn and still have to pay only 1 resource to ready him (instead of 4).
