Does anyone know of a place that sells individual cards or encounter sets? I am looking to pick up a few extra encounter sets so I can put quests together without having to take the cards from another quest. The only place I've seen individual cards is on ToyWiz but I don't know anything about them and their shipping is at least $6 even for a few cards.

 So far ToyWiz seems to be the only place that I've found that sells cards individually.  I'll search around a bit and if I find another I'll post on here again.

 Be advised that if you're looking for a full set of the 1x cards, it's going to be cheaper to buy two more Core Sets.

 Yeah, I think I calculated the price to get all cards up three by purchasing individual cards and it came out to be somewhere around $140.  Granted, I threw in two more threat trackers into the calculation, but those weren't very much.

I already own 2 core sets. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'm considering picking up a third one, but I'm not sure yet. I'm not super concerned with having 3x of the 1x cards, but I wouldn't mind it. It would also be nice to have more cards just because I'm the only person that buys cards for a 4 person group that I play with.

The main thing I want right now is just enough Encounter sets that I don't have to swap cards between quests. Those are going for $1 per encounter set on Toy Wiz, so I might end up doing that.

I've also been tempted to purchase singles online but been put off by the price. I think the problem is that the only way to get spare cards is to buy a core set. Therefore anyone selling singles online is going to seem expensive as they will want to make a profit on the core set they have broken open.

I'm slightly confused why FFG didn't just include 3 of each card in the core set. Even more absurd is the way in which I've seen some cards described as "Rare" and "Uncommon" (e.g Unexpected Courage is "Rare") - how does this make any sense when you know exactly what cards are in each core and expansion set ? It's good that the expansion packs include three of each cards as this allows for better tournament deck building.

I ended up buying four Core sets and i have done what the original poster said. Broken up the encounters so that each one has its own complete set of cards.

That was an afterthought though. I originally bought the extra sets to give me three of every card to play with as well as a set that I put into a binder so that I can quickly read through it to see what the cards are when building decks. once I work out what I want I get them out of my play pool.

Regards the "Rare" thing I think people are just struggling to find a term to use regards the difficulty of getting a card because they only come one or two to a Core set. I guess technically it is rarer if you only get one per box vs two or three. Poor wording though.

I think FFG put singles of some cards in the core set to give a wider range of cards to use without exceeding the total card count in the box. Admittedly this means you need to buy more core sets to get a play set to start with but I don't begrudge them that they need to make a little money from the start. Their method is still far better than the CCG method. When was the last time you only had to spend $15 to get a complete play set of a CCG expansion.
