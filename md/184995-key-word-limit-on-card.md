Hi!

A quick question; can I have 2 cards with key word limit on a character? (I have basic set of cards) and I wonder if I can use 2x armour and 2x Dwarven axe on Gimli so I can 1 shot everyone. I wonder if it's against the rules or not

Dwarven Axe and Citadel Plate both have the "restricted" keyword.  You are allowed to have at most 2 restricted cards on a hero.  So, you could have 2 axes, 2 armors, or 1 of each.  But not 2 of each.

Just so you know, there are some other cards in the Mirkwood cycle and Dwarrowdelf that also add attack or hit points that are not restricted, so you can play combinations of cards on Gimli that gives him a ridiculously high attack :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Allsorts can happen as your card pool grows!
