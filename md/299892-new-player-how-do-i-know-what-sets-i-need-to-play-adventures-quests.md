Hi,

New player here, snagging sets as I find them on sale.  One question I have is how can I tell what sets I need to play the quests included in the adventure packs? 

For instance, do I need a Sands of Harad to play the Quests in The Crossing of Poros adventure pack?  I assume that each quest in an adventure pack has its own set of encounter cards (some new symbol), but what about the other symbols needed to construct the encounter deck?

Thanks!

Indeed, in order for the cycle to feel consistent and have common themes among its quests, the quests in the adventure packs share one or more generally two or three encounter sets, which are the little groups of cards linked by a theme and a symbol, with the quests in the expansion. And yes, you need the deluxe expansion to play each of its adventure packs. I recommend using hallofbeorn.com, cardgamedb.com or ringsdb,com  to see all the expansions listed with their respective cycles.

Thanks!

Would I need any expansions other than the Core Set and the Deluxe Expansion to play the quests in the adventure packs within that Deluxe Expansion's cycle?

That is, I wouldn't need any earlier Deluxe Expansions or Adventure Packs to play through more recent Cycles, as long as I have all the adventures and the Deluxe expansion related to that cycle?


Thanks much!

Nope you are good to go as long as you get the deluxe for that cycle. I would recommend just grabbing whatever deluxe interests you and has the most adventure packs available.

There is a community blog about playing quests with this set of cards: core+ deluxe. (https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/ [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/])
Can be a great help if you are new to the game. 

Seastan also has some youtube videos on "minimum purchase mode", playing the quest with only the packs necessary to play the quest.

Yeah a deluxe kicks off a cycle.  The deluxe is required to play the adventure packs (AP) in that cycle.  The coreset is the deluxe for the Mirkwood cycle.

Wilds of Rhovanian I think is the only deluxe that requires the core set though.

Well, all deluxes require at least one Core, but Wilds of Rhovanion is the only one that uses cards from it. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
