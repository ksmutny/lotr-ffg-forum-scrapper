The rules say that a player may CHANGE cards from his deck between the quests.I can remove or add cards(for example I had 50 cards and for a new scenario I want 55 or I had 55 and I want 50 for a new quest)?I think I can,but I want to be sure!

You can anything to your deck, you just get a penalty for changing heroes.
