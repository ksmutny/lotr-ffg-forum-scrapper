If you lived in Middle Earth, were would you like to be from?(or race) What would be your background?

 

For example, this would be me:

 

Hi,

I am a man of Gondor and was born in South Gondor.  I am 29 years old and love the outdoors and wilderness.  What do I do for a job you might ask?  Well I train soldiers how to survive in the wilderness and live off of it.  I show them how to make fast, but comferable camps in remote area's becasue of course, an army needs to be able to set up a camp for overnight if traveling far distances.  I aIso show them how to treat wounds, (small ones at least, the surgeon takes care of the big wounds) and how to move through the forest quitly if needed.  And many other things like that.  I think you get the Idea.  What's the latest news?  Well, I heard just a few days ago from a traveler from far away up north that a small company of Dwarves are going on an adventure to take back Erebor and kill the mighty and magnificent Smaug!  Ha! I've heard of the Dragon before but there are few in Gondor that know much about him.  I doubt those dwarves will get far at all!  Well, I better be going, there are many more soldiers to be trained!

 

Your turn

I think i would want to be a dunedain ranger of the north.  Silently going about my business of protecting the free people of middle earth from evil without gratitude or acknowledgment.  I have no specific profession unless you count wilderness survival which i practice on a daily basis or possibly hunting but only for subsidence for myself or others.  I love nature and living life out doors although ive always wanted to visit Rivendell and pay respects to Elrond in his majestic halls.  It would be an honor to meet him especially after going on orc hunting raids with his sons on more than one occasion

nice thread. i am torn between two

 

i have always found the dunedain the most 'roleplay' luring for me. wandering the wilderness, protecting hobbits, drinking pints with gandalf in the prancing pony, going on errands for the white council....sweet. i would wander the little known areas of middle earth...take a stroll through moria's secret paths.

 

or....

 

given my background in real life, i would want to be a student of lore..someone who discovers the workings of middle earth...the physics. i think saruman would be closest to what i am in real life...though without the urge to rule the world haha

 

i suppose i could be a lore-learned ranger? sounds good to me....

I would just take the oportunity then to invite all of you to a second breakfeast at my hobbit home. It's just down the hill and to the left of where that cracked Bilbo and Frodo lived. I must admit that I do envy them just a little bit but I'm really too found of my peacefull living to fancy any adventures thank you very much. I'm a gardner just like my cussin twice removed on my mothers uncles cussins side...hm...Samwise Gamgee I think his name was. Where my love lies is indeed in growing things, great food and a wiff of Old Toby. So come one come all to my second breakfeast. But only if you promise me I won't end up in some lengthy adventure. Oh, and Witch King, you have to leave you Morgul Blade at home. Well meat fellow middle-earthicans

You would be Khamul, second in command of the Nazgul, and leader for a short time after the witch king dies :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

mouth of sauron would be cool. i wish tolkien had gave more background on him,working his way up into sauron's favour. still perhaps his mystery makes him all the more interesting

EDIT- you posted at the same time as me haha.....but yes, england, the world.......my own mind may be the first step though :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Hi ho, there!  I'm Hildibrand Greenthumb, up from from Michel Delving way.... just thought I'd drop in and give a greeting while I'm in Hobbiton visiting my cousins, Fredegar and Estella Bolger...  That's right, I was named after our great-grandfather!  Well, on my mother's side...  The Tooks, Brandybucks, Sacksville-Baggins' and other cousins look a little down on me, what with Ma marrying into the Greenthumbs and all.  But I don't care- my Pop is the best gardener in all the Shire!  Even ol' Gandalf, the crazy wizard, stops in to our shop to refill his supply of Longbottom Leaf whenever he's in town.  In fact, my Pop can trace his roots all the way back to Tobold "Old Toby" Hornblower- and he's got the family secret passed on down to him!  Some day, he's gonna teach me everything he knows and pass the shop onto me... and boy, do I have big plans!  I also love baking and have a weakness for sweet pastries... (get that from my Took side)... I tried putting some of Pop's best Old Toby into some of Ma's fudge cake-squares, just to see what would happen....  I'm not allowed in the kitchen for the rest of the month   <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]  

 

Oh, and watch out for that Mr. Thomas Schmidt... far be it from me (an upstanding hobbit, to be sure) to talk ill about anyone... but he lives a little too close to that cooky old Bilbo.  (I think his cousin even gardens for him!)  He likes to invite people over for meals, and we all know what happened the last time people got together in that neck of the Shire...  Hobbits started disappearing.  I heard dwarves were pillaging pantries left and right.  And someone even said that a dragon attacked during a party!  You never hear of that unseemliness going on in Michael Delving.  We're much more civilized out our way...

excellent. its nice to see people going for the hobbit life as well as the life of danger!

Well, as I've stated before, my favorite characters are actually the Dunedain.  I love the combination of nobility and tragedy that makes up their back-story... but short of NEEDING to live a life of conflict, and if I had to settle in one place to live, the Shire would be it.  I couldn't live underground with the dwarves, the elves are much too refined for my long-term tastes ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png], and Gondorian men are just too... dramatic.  So it would be the open plains and the life of a horse nomad for me, or the beautiful green forests of the Shire... And since my good friend Brownmantle (haven't seen him on the forums in a while) would 100% be ending up in the Shire, I figured I'd tag along to have an old pal to sit on the porch and blow smoke-rings with... lol
