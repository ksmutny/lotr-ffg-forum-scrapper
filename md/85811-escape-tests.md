How is your memory?

 

Is there a Action phase AFTER the escape cards are revealed but before the escape test resolves?

 

 1. The Escape is initiated
 2. You commit your characters to the test.
 3. You draw the cards for the test (all other effects on the cards are ignored)
 4. You add the escape values (if no value is printed on the card it = 0) and compare it to your characters committed will (or attack if the test is form that treachery) 
 5. The Escape Test resolves
 6. If you pass the test nothing happens, if you fail pay the fail cost.

I am pretty sure this is how they resolve.

 

The question then is, can I use a action between 5/6? Can i say tap Faramir or discard for Protector of Lorien to boost the WILL in a test on the characters, before the resolution of the effect occurs but AFTER the escape value is revealed? 

 

Thanks in Advance

Depends. If it is a when revealed effect then you can't, if it is the gollume effect you can. When Reveled are forced responses and happen in the staging area reveal before there is any chance for actions. This is why test of will is a response not a action. So a when reveal escape test accours in that same wwindow.. as in NO actions can be played. BUT the gollum thing occours after you have finished the staging area reveal step, and yes, there is an action phase here, all the way to the end of the travel phase. So this escape test is happening in a massive action window.. so yes you can use actions then. As the rules state ANY TIME in a action window you can cast a action card.

I'm not sure this is correct, though i agree with the action window stuff. The question is if the escape test is a single result of a response. Say you had a response that allowed you to draw to cards. You can not play a action between drawing card 1 and card 2 as the drawing of the cards is a single result of the response. Due to the lack of a stack, each response needs to resolve before anything else can trigger... so the real question is if the entire escape test is a single resolution of a forced response .. if so you can not play actions.

Well thanks to all for your incredibly interesting discussion! hehe

Question

Escape Tests (The Dead Marshes)

Is there the opportunity to play actions during the resolution of a escape test, after the escape cards have been dealt but before the players will is calculated? As in a similar window to the quest phase after the staging area is revealed but before quest tokens are placed.

Answer

No, there is no action window at that time. The only action window during an Escape test is after committing characters to the test but before dealing cards from the encounter deck.

Cheers,
Caleb
