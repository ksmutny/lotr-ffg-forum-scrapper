Just like in the COTR progression series where they where wiped out in Road to Rivendell. Those who have seen it knows what I mean. They didn't just loose they where destroyed, grounded into dust and spread for the winds ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] does any other have any similar experiences?

My first attempt at the Lonely Mountain on solo, the first time I faced Smaug the Magnificent, he attacked me 6 times.  On the next turn, he attacked me 4 times and I was done.  As I kept flipping flipping over new shadow cards, watched him attack again and again, and ripped my dwarfs to pieces, I couldn't help but laugh.  I went from feeling like I had a good shot to beat the scenario to being totally crushed.  I went online to make sure I was playing it right, and Caleb's comment was something like: if Smaug toasted a dwarf army while taking Erebor, he can toast your dwarf army while defending it.  Well then.  When I finally beat the scenario, it made me feel really good!

this will generally happen i think in the first few rounds or set up. i remember before i really learned how to play properly and when conflict at the carrock had just come out, i just rushed in blindly questing high power which was all i really knew how to do then

 

i flew through 1b thinking 'this is so easy!!' then the trolls came. my super questing deck probably built up of spirit cards got wiped out....i mean the trolls were making sandwiches of eowyn by the time i lost :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Definitely the Lonely Mountain for me. The first time I played it, the first round of facing Smaug, he attacked 7 times in a row and killed all of my heroes. The best part is, I had an awesome draw and was totally thinking I had the scenario in the bag. I was so mad that I kept drawing through the deck, just to see how many more attacks he would have made. Of the top 10 cards on the encounter deck, I think 9 of them had burgle effects. That scenario is kinda ridiculous. Lately, I've been sadistic enough to attempt Escape from Dol Guldur Nightmare solo. Typically one or two rounds in, it is obvious that I have lost the game, in some case horribly. It is a welcome change after stomping some of the Against the Shadows scenarios.

Shadow and Flame

 

We had what we thought were fantastic draws to be ready for the turn 2 assault, but the first Shadow card was "Doomed 1", so out came Mr Happypants, which wouldn't have even killed anything, but the 2nd Shadow card was his +3 Attack Sword. 

 

Turn 1 slaughter.

Solo Road to Rivendell, turn 4 or 5. Army was set up, staging area clean. Questingphase: Orc Ambush which returned like 6 Orcs or so. Wouldn't be to bad but it has surge and it surged (of course) to Sleeping Sentry....

This combination is sooo brutal if you don't have your "A Test of Will" ready!

Anytime on red horn gate where snowstorm just kills off my characters is always a rough way to end, especially if I'm pushing on the last turn for victory or something

Beyond some of the early obvious "suspects" as epic loss options (Dol Guldor, RTM, etc), I finally got around to heading through the HoN quests.

 

Just started trying to get through Into Ithilien last night.  Pain.  Horrible, horrible pain.... lol

 

Tried 4 games.  As each game came and went, things seemed to get a little better.  I felt really good the last game (had a good ally base and all three of the Ranger objective allies on my side), but still threated out before I could quest to the 4th site.  If you have a really strong base down with some decent options in your hand and still just have your ass handed to you, you know that someone was SERIOUSLY drunk when they printed that as a "difficulty level 4" quest.... lol

 

First game I tried of it, Gimli died.  In round one... lol

Heh, sounds like my very first encounter with the Carrock quest. I remember it like yesterday, 1st game, 1st round, 1st enemy. Muck adder wounds Aragon. Bye bye hero and the game just spun down to a big loss in no time from there :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Journey Down the Anduin solo style. First turn, I drew that Goblin card that removes a travel token every time he attacks. Then set up Hill Troll. First quest phase I drew that stupid Wolf Rider, he surged the second Hill Troll. I got slaughtered on turn two.
