The One Ring must be destroyed, but it is resilient. It survives boiling in lava, and a volcanic eruption... but at the last, it is cast into the fire. If you listen closely, you can hear the Ring's last gasp as it finally bursts into flames. Four and a half years in the making, I have finished my Lord of the Rings Living Card Game Saga campaign. What a ride!

So... The game is dead?

No, the next we will the The White Lord of the rings, that is stronger and wiser than the previous one! Or at least seems to be...

When I was reading the card, I was like: What? Am I really supposed to destroy the card? Sure I have four copies of it, but really? And I couldn't bring myself to this needless act of destruction. Guess I will never really win the Saga :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

However great and flavorfull video :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I am curious: How many at least ripped their "ring" appart and how many chose to keep it?

I dream of the day when I will take my "destroyed" one ring, put it in a beautiful handcrafted wooden case, and hide it away, locked up . . . forever.

I could never destroy my precious.

Do you really choose to destroy the ring at the end of the campaign? This was the only challenge of the saga I can't defeat ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]
