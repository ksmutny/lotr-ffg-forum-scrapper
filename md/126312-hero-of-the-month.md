Hey all! Trying out something that will hopefully prove insightful/interesting over at my blog, The Secondhand Took. Each month I'm going to showcase a different hero, go over some discussion topics about the hero and mostly showcase some deck lists I either found on the internet or came up with myself.

 

As always I'd love to hear any feedback! The link is below.

 

Hope you all had a fun Halloween!

I just started it, and it's been hard trying to release content at a decent pace but I'm working on it haha. Glad you liked it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
