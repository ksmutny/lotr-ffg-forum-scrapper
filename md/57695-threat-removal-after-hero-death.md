 Hi everyone,

its my first day with the game an during my first solo play one of my heroes died and I didn't know if his threat level should be removed from the overall threat counter.

Logic would dictate it should be removed, seeing as he is not a threat anymore, but I could't find anything in the manual (I know its probably there somewhere).

So that's my question thanks in advance to anyone that can help.

Cheers

Yeah, the forces of Sauron aren't going to say "Tough luck that, losing one of your heroes.  Tell you what, we'll back off a little bit so you can catch your feet a bit."

 

Not happening, and so the answer is that if your hero dies, his threat rating is NOT removed from your total threat.
