# [What&#039;s your favorite artwork of a Middle-earth character?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90561-whats-your-favorite-artwork-of-a-middle-earth-character/)

## 1 [Karlson on September 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90561-whats-your-favorite-artwork-of-a-middle-earth-character/?do=findComment&comment=868857)

There's been a lot of "favorite this" and "favorite that" threads lately here on the forums (including the favorite hero tournament - congratulations Legolas!)  So, I thought I'd do a favorite character artwork thread.  

 

Though some characters are only featured on their actual hero/ally cards, many others are featured in event and encounter deck cards as well.  

 

So, out of all the ones you've seen and played with time and time again, what's your favorite character artwork in the game?

 

Mine goes to the artwork of Boromir featured in the Leadership attachment card, Path of Need.

Not only is Boromir my favorite character, but this artwork is just outstanding.  It captures him in his last moments of heroic sacrifice.  The only drawback to this artwork is the loss of details that ensues in the actual player card due to the small size!  

 

I suppose it's only fair to also feature my favorite villain character artwork as well.

...and that goes to Ghulat!

Even though he's not a traditional LotR character, this artwork is the most intense depiction of an orc I've ever seen.  However, he always dies nevertheless after Amon Din has been saved!

 

 

I look forward to seeing the artwork that everyone else likes in this great game!

i think nameless fear is a particularly intriguing choice given its mystery in the books. the designers pretty much had free reign due to its ambiguity in the books. i do like the outcome

I love Eowyn art. Also, Damrod is cool too. I like Elder Things from the Foundation of the Stone also.

Gildor Inglorion.  The artwork here perfectly depicts the way Tolkien described Gildor--no easy feat!  I also like Protector of Lórien, for the same reason.

The Arwen Undomiel artwork is just beautiful..Arwen_MagaliVilleneuve.jpg [http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OvRhtVCupWE/T3EBHzc_tgI/AAAAAAAAAgI/pBF4bvkMCxc/s1600/Arwen_MagaliVilleneuve.jpg]

 

Favorite artwork on an enemy card would probably have to be... Lieutenant of Mordor (Although it's super hard to just pick one since there are sooo many great ones)

The artwork in LOTR LCG is just outstanding.

 

I look at the art in the other LCGs and this stuff is the tops.  BTW is there a website were you can view those full art shots?  Where are you guys digging those up at?

 

That said,  easily Legolas, as it is much closer to how I imagined him when I read the books long before the films came out.

Ithilien Archer is probably my favorite ally.  I love the green and maroon hues.  The hood and wrap around the face is exactly how i pictured the rangers in the book too.

 

Also in regards to cards being a perfect representation of what I imagined while reading, lore aragorn and elrond really shine for me.  That first time you hear strider described in the prancing pony could not be more spot on with Tony Foti's illustration

Ithilien Archer is one of my favorite ally artworks as well.  Knight of Minas Tirith is at the top too!

The Spirit version of Glorfindel, definitely. He looks exactly as he should. Besides, at least in some versions of what Tolkien wrote, the guy defeated a balrog at Gondolin and came back to life. How badass is that?

what is key to me is not the characters themselves (they need to be good obviously), but their setting. take G. up above. amazing scenery.

 

the same with arwen. even though she is stunningly beautiful as a portrayal, i think it is the autumn leaves that draw me initially in

## 14 [Olorin93 on September 19, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90561-whats-your-favorite-artwork-of-a-middle-earth-character/?do=findComment&comment=870580)

Aye, the scenery doesn't exactly make it worse. I agree about Arwen. Another favourite of mine happens to be Beregond. The light and shadows are very well done and I just love his outfit, pose, sword and everything else. Magali Villeneuve is probably my favourite illustrator in the game. Btw, does anyone else think Haldir and Arwen were originally painted together? It certainly looks like the same setting.

I really like this art, and agree with your points, but I wish it (clearly) looked like he had two arms (somethings always bugged me about it, and I think that's it).

One of my many favorites and an excellent choice for the Season 3 Game Night kit playmat.  Does Magali sells prints?  I seem to remember the COTR podcast asking her about it during the interview, but can't recall the reponse.

I absolutely LOVE Leadership Boromir's and Faramir's art. And look at the attachment Blood of Numenor.  She had already planned Faramir out! Amazing.

I think I also remember listening to that CotR podcast and believe Magali said that Fantasy Flight had the ownership rights to all her LotR artwork and therefore, she couldn't sell them on her own.  I could be wrong, but I think it was something along those lines.  

And yes, all of Magali's artwork is stunning, but her recent work for Gondor heroes like Faramir and Boromir are simply the best.

Elrohir is one of my faves as can be seen.

All art from Magali. Especially the Denethor ally. I love that it is actually "zoom" on Trained for war (when you look closely, you can see him leaning against a pillar)

And from others - Hero Denethor and Strenght of Arms...

But I can´t find full images (or bigger cards) :-(

Whoa!  I've never noticed that before.  Thanks for pointing that out.  I always assumed it was young Boromir and Faramir playing as kids in the citadel beneath the White Tree, but I've never noticed Denethor in the background (and the ally card of it zoomed in is really fantastic!)

While I have previously noticed Denethor standing in the back of trained for war, this is the first time I'm realizing his ally is the zoomed in version of that. Bravo on the connection; that is just all sorts of cool

Yeah that's very cool. I kind of hope they'll do more like that, where you find picture in pictures. Even when they have the same artist draw the same character on a separate card, that's really nice.  Like Legolas on Hands Upon the Bow, and Arwen on her objective and on her ally card.

After the connection between Denethor and Trained for War, I kept looking for Beravor on the backs of the Mûmakil.

While Dainche and Villeneuve is probably the most talented couple in the business, the honor of the best art in the game goes to Frodo:

I agree, Magali's artwork is amazing but i think her version of Durins Bane was just too friendly. The other one (The Nameless Fear) in the Khazad Dum deluxe expansion was scary as hell and i thought it was more fitting  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I agree. When I first laid eyes upon it (a hasty glance), I thought that the massive arm was, in fact, his wings and the red spots on his chest shades of his palm extending towards his watcher. It was perfect. Later on, when I looked at it more carefully, I was a little disappointed, because the initial impression was much more menacing. Still, it's an excellent piece of art.

 

My favorite Balrog art is in the Whip Lash, by the same artist:

A million times better than the Magali's.

i always enjoy seeing artists portray balrogs as alternate to the usual 'flame demon'. it shows that tolkien was never clear on his description

Timo Karhula took the Shadow part under serious consideration, however. See how he pops up through the shadows? His manifestation isn't even complete yet. His wings and feet are yet to fully materialize.

I think I just figured it out (what bugs me about the art, other than the one arm thing). I may have mentioned this elsewhere before, but I think he kind of looks like David Bowie (not annoying in itself, I'm a fan, but unexpected).

I'll never be able to look at Glorfindel the same way again. Pretty funny though.
