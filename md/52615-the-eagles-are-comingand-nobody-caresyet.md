 Maybe I just don't see the value, but this card doesn't seem to carry the  Deus Ex Machina, game changing weight that its title conveys or demands.  It's really suffering from a lack of trait support, and even the cards it can search for are fairly costly, at least until the Tactics Song comes out.  There's not really anything wrong with the card. It's free and allows a player to grab more than one eagle. I actually like this card a lot. I'm just sulking because I have no reason to play it yet. I was ok when Born(e) Aloft didn't have the eagle trait. Applying a more focused lens to my nerd sorrow is that  To the Eyrie is missing the eagle trait. Argh. I'm so disappointed. I don't have a right to be. And once I find some deck creativity in an hour or so, I'll probably forget I had a complaint. We'll see at least one or two more eagle cards before this cycle is out... or else Radagast will be a one scenario pony, too.(maybe..until we can start building pony decks)

I'm sure there were many players who felt similar displeasure when Mustering the Rohirrim was released in the first AP. Now it has some utility, (and having a usable card in a deck that also adds deck shuffling scratches that gambler's fallacy itch). I can't imagine not including it in a Rohan themed deck whether I win or not.  

I shouldn't be complaining at all, even though search cards are not major league status. I'm at least fortunate enough to get APs immediately from my local retailer during these first cycle growing pains.  Hopefully this can start a discussion.

I wouldn't worry too much. As more cards are added I'm sure we'll get more eagle cards and it will gain a bit more usefulness. They have to start somewhere...

Well the card itself is an Eagle which means you can always grab it if you don't come up with an actual Eagle. I would gather we see at least one more Eagle maybe two.

I'm thinking about houseruling Born(e) aloft as having the eagle trait to see if "TEaC" gets useable. As for now, I didn't include that card once...

Born Aloft is a nice card, it gives a free gandalf almost as sneak attack. You seriously want to reuse this guy and you don't always play leadership/spirit.

I know, I ment I didn't include The Eagles are coming in any deck so far.

Part functional for deck building, part marketing ploy.  There are enough Eagles and Rohan cards that they can be a theme in a deck, but not a primary theme yet.  But you know that folks look at those cards and the buzz is...wow, I can't wait until....

Borne aloft is better than sneak attack in my opinion when used on gandalf as he can stay around for the entire turn and then come back to hand. Also borne aloft as it's free doesn't have to be in a specific tactics deck.

As per game rules, you can't play borne aloft if you have no tactic hero as per current card pool.

 Born Aloft means you have to pay the full resource cost for Gandalf twice and you have to bring him out in the planning stage.  The advantage of Sneak Attack is that you can bring Gandalf out the first time at a very low cost, you can deploy him in reaction an unexpected surprise to the encounter deck, and you can circumvent restrictions on playing allies.

Unless you are taking advantage of the ability to recycle attachments (Second Breakfast or Erebor Hammersmith), than Sneak Attack is a far superior card.

At this point there are enough Rohan cards to make a 50 card deck using only Rohan characters.  Just thought I'd point that out.

This is correct.  The only other way is when a tactics song is released and strangely enough, it's not in the Journey to Rhosgobel...

Well, they had to get Radagast in somewhere. Now if only Born(e) Aloft had the creature trait..... happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 

I know we'll see some more eagle cards, and we'll see them soon. I hope at least one of them is economical to play before turn 3 in a mono tactics deck. Tactics still has the roughest time of the four factions, but I love em.
