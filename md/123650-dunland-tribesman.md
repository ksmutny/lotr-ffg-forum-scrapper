Hi All,

 

I have a query about the Dunland Tribesman enemy in The Voice of Isenguard encounters...

 

It's text reads: When Revealed: Each player draws a card. 

Forced: After a player draws any number of cards, Dunland Tribesman gets +1 Threat until the end of the round. 

 

Does this mean in a 3 player game it would get +3 threat, as 3 players have drawn cards or just the one as it states "a player" and "any number of cards"?

 

We always play worst case scenario in situations like this, so it has always had the +3 threat. But I have always been curious about his one!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Many thanks in advance.

You're right.

 

In your case and with 3 player, it would get +3 threat when the card is revealed.

 

If a second is revealed, the first get again +3 threat (for a total of +6) and the second get +3 threat.
