Are there only two quest cards...1A/B and 2A/B? Seems like most other quests state if you complete the last quest the players win the game. Or something along those lines. Just curious. Thanks all.

Yep. After you get 1 progress on 2b and have destroyed all Troll enemies in play,  you win the game

In my opinion the reason for no win condition on 2B is the nightmare version.

At the time of writing stage 2B for Conflict at the Carrock, Nightmare mode wasn’t even a thing yet; so that wouldn’t be the reason for having no stated win condition. It did line up nicely, though!
