But today, when browsing through cards, this thing caught my eye:

It reads "gains". This means that effects like:

Nm, should have checked the FAQ first.

Attached with Steward of Gondor that exhausts after the hero commits to the quest, you can ready him. Also works (even better) with Theodred, Horn of Gondor, Keys of Orthanc, Gloin.

I actually asked Caleb for clarification about those paragraphs.  In that set of paragraphs it is not clear.  I was unable to get a definite answer from Caleb, so until then I think either interpretation is fair play and in some instances moving being gaining resources actually hurts the player.

Wrong.

 

Here is a quote from one of email conversations with Caleb:

 

“Moving” and “adding” resources both fall under the umbrella of “gaining” resources (i.e. If I move a resource from Gloin to Aragorn, Aragorn has gained a resource), but “moving” a resource does not qualify as “adding” a resource. In order to add a resource, there must be a +1 total count in resources (i.e. I play Wealth of Gondor to add a resource to Boromir’s resource pool increasing my total resource count by +1).

From the text of Heir of Mardil, as soon as you add resources from a card effect, you ready the hero. I can't see how moving or adding resources on the hero with this attachement doesn't make him gaining any resources. It's clear for me! Cards like Parting gifts or Erand-rider would all work.

It's great to see a confirmation on this. I'll definately be trying this combo.

Heir of Mardil uses the word "gain" (not add) which makes it even clearer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ooh, good spot! I've been wanting to throw this into a deck, now it looks much more likely!

Gaining a resource is the result of a resource being moved or added to your hero.

I know that LOTR LCG likes to make life difficult for players, but not always... well, this card is restricted to a Noble hero.

And Noble is the most common hero trait in the game, appearing on 25 heroes (including Fellowship Aragorn, so 24 for regular deckbuilding). As restrictions go, it's not that big of one.

Wow! I never thought they were that many! Well, this makes this card even better!

How you guys haven't noticed this combo before. I have used Heir of Mardil, Theodred and Elrond so many times. It's really good way to get use of Elrond's good stats.

I've been using the Theodred + Heir of Mardil literally in every my Leadership deck, I just never realized it went off not only "add a resource", but also "move a resource" trigger.
