As I wrote in the other thread I think we will see a Dwarf ally for each sphere. My guess is Gloin, Dwalin, Bifur and Bombur.

We'll definitely see Balin as one of the heroes.

Yeah, I assume so.  I just don't know which sphere.  Probably Spirit or Leadership, right?

I'd love to recreate Balin's adventures in Moria with Oin and Ori.  Since we already have a hero for Ori, I hope we get hero versions of Balin and Oin.  In fact, if Oin doesn't get a hero version this time, I'll probably make a custom version of him, just so that I can have the three of them enter Moria in a sort of custom quest using many of the encounter sets from KD and the latter parts of the Dwarrowdelf cycle.  The point would be to survive long enough to write the Book of Mazarbul.
