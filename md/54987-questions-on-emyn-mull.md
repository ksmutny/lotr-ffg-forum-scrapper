When a card gains "surge" twice, should I reveal two more cards?  This situation comes up:

On the quest card, it reads, "Forced: If there are no location cards in the staging area, the first treachery card revealed during the quest phase gains surge."

In the quest phase, the first card revealed is Impassable Chasm, which reads, "When Revealed: If there is an active location, remove all progress tokens from that location and return it to the staging area. If no location is moved by this efect, this card gains surge."  As there are no active location and no locations in the staging area, both effects would give the treachery "surge".  In this case, how many more cards should I reveal? 

(Similarly, when the staging area is clear and "Driven by Shadow" is drawn during this scenario, it gains surge twice).

I don't see why you would not Surge twice. Nothing in the rules states that a card cannot have more than 1 instance of Surged or Doomed. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

What about double Ranged character? Some keywords can stack, some can't. I am not sure if we can answer the question about Surge and be confident about it.

 I realize this is a weak argument, but in aGoT and CoC, keywords don't stack - that is, if a card already has surge, and another card gives it surge, it would only surge once.

I don't see why you couldn't have a double Ranged character. The second one would just be useless.

Yeah, you can have double ranged keyword, but it does not stack.

That's a good question. For now i'd say surge multiplies so to speak. In fact when in doubt pick the worst outcome for the players. This is FFG we're talking about here ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] But i'm not sure there is something conclusive out there so far.

 Personally I think you would get surge twice.  It says surge twice so you get it twice.

I don't think it's a weak argument. Imho, Surge would have to be defined differently to allow for it to 'stack'. It would have to be defined like the 'Doomed' keyword, i.e. 'Surge X', X being the number of additional cards to be revealed.

I would probably Surge twice as well, but I understand your point here Doomed specifically says "Doomed 1" which leaves room for a "Doomed 2" or "Doomed 3".

Surge is just Surge...

If it could stack it would make sense to call it "Surge 1" and then all cards adding Surge would say: "... gains Surge +1"

I can see how that would be a better solution. BUt honestly... I think FFG wants us to execute Surge twice... even if it doesn't have support anywhere in the rules (neither is it denied anywhere).

Think of it this way, would benefit would you get from giving Range twice to a hero? It's not going to let you attack two different enemies that another player or players are engaged with. You could give it twice but I don't think it would make any difference.
