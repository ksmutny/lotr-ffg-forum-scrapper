In the Netrunner community, there is this awesome unofficial resource named ANCUR that aims to be a central repository for the often confusing rules details for that game. (Check it out here: http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Project_ANCUR_Wiki [http://ancur.wikia.com/wiki/Project_ANCUR_Wiki] )

The LotR LCG community has long deserved a similar resource—we all know that the extant official rulings floating around could fill volumes. I want to try to assemble these into a viewable, searchable format. (Anyone who's suffered through searching the forums here for rulings knows that a better way must exist.)

First things first, though: data collection. Obviously, there are several places that already contain many rulings. But harvesting the data will be an arduous process.

So let me start with lower-hanging fruit: I've set up a bare-bones form where people can log official rulings that they've PERSONALLY received over e-mail via the official rules inquiry form on FFG's website:

https://goo.gl/forms/VGuE7WFTXEcehoCq2 [https://goo.gl/forms/VGuE7WFTXEcehoCq2]

I figure seeding a database with these e-mailed rulings would be a good start, as it ensures minimal duplication of results. Also, a relatively small number of people have probably generated a disproportionate percentage of the rulings, so if I can get "buy-in" from those few, we should have a pretty good start.

I hope you agree this could be a valuable resource for the community. I will keep you posted with how things are going.

In Thrones and L5R, developer rulings get added directly to the ThronesDB/FiveringsDB card page by a volunteer. This way you don't have to check a third resource for rulings on a card.

Sure, and Netrunner does something similar for its UFAQ rulings on individual cards. The issue is (and I'm not saying this isn't the case in other LCGs, but…), rather a lot of the rulings in LotR are not terribly card-specific, so I'm not sure the card-database model for rulings works for this game. This is part of why ANCUR still exists.

(Separate point: a lot of rulings are encounter-card-based rather than player card, so we'd basically be begging Beorn to add the functionality to the Hall.)
