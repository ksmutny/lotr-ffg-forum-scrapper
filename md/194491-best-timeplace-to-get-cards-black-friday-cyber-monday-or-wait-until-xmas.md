Hi, I live in New Zealand, so to save costs, I order LotR LCG expansions and packs from the US in chunks, usually one or two shipments a year.  I find Funagain Games to be the cheapest in terms of overseas shipping for bulk orders, so I usually order from them.  I was hoping for a Black Friday sale on Funagain Games, but don't see it.

 

So I'm wondering: what other online shops should I check out for black friday / cyber money (or xmas / boxing day) deals on LotR LCG cards?  Or are card prices usually not drastically reduced by deals?

Hi, it's been more than a year since I last purchased cards, and as a result my shopping list is now quite long: Sands of Harad, Flame of the West, Siege of Annuminas, and 6 scenario packs!

I checked out the prices on FFG, Funagain Games, Miniature Market, Amazon, and eBay.  At this point the cheapest would be Miniature Market which would have a total of $153 plus $39 shipping to New Zealand, which totals $192.  Ouch!!!

In the past I used to spend a lot less for a similar amount of content.  I think mostly that was because I bought when Funagain Games or Miniature Market had special sales.  For example, I used to spend $8.99 or $9.99 per scenario pack instead of $12 or $14.

So, here are my questions:

1) Are Funagain Games and Miniature Market still the best places to order LotR LCG products for those of us who live overseas (specifically, in New Zealand)?  Or is there another store that I should check out?

2) For the recommended stores, when do you think the next sales will take place which will affect LotR prices?  Is Black Friday the only reliable sales period?

 

Thanks!

I'm in Australia, but I've been buying from ozgameshop.com & also bookdepository.co.uk.  They both have a limited range, but they have cheap / free postage.  No idea if they ship over the ditch, or how it changes the prices.

A problem arises because not all sets/packs are available all at the same time. They come in and out of stock at different intervals. From experience it's unlikely that you'll find all the packs you want available at one point in time.
