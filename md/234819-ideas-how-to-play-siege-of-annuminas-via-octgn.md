Hi Folks,

 

after the epic battle at the fellowship events i wanna host this scenario via OCTGN.

Do you have some ideas how to handle this without having up to 12 player in one OCTGN game?

Run three apart games at the same time. Use Power in the Earths to represent cards from other games.

I meant let three groups play the different quest decks separately while communicating with Skype or so. In the few cases you have to move a card from a group to another the latter group picks any card and pretends it to be the card from the other group...or maybe just picking the actual card removed by the program at the beginning.*bashes his head*

Power in the Earth is a 1 cost spirit attachment from the Core Set which attaches to a location and gives it -1 threat. It is considered one of the weakest cards in the game and that's why I mentioned it to represent those cards so that nobody can think it's theirs.

Ah ok .. thanks for your explaination.

If you were a player in all 3 games you could have them on your screen as separate instances.  The cards would look teeny tiny unless you had a jumbotron monitor.

Or if you were only in one of the games, you could have one instance of octgn in play mode and the other two watching twitch (or just get the other two feeds directly from twitch or a similar service).

Is it playable solo?

Yes, you can play with just one stage in the Standard mode, or I suppose you could bring three decks and play the epic multiplayer mode with one deck at each of the three stages.

I think playing the epic mode with less than 6 players should be very nasty. The Hosts-mechanic do not scale with the players so you have do to more damage with less heroes/decks.

It's certainly harder to muster 16 damage with only one deck per stage, but all you really need is Outlands.

We did it last night. Played Annûminas with 6 players divded into 3 teams of 2 players.

We used three OCTGN 2-player-games and a discord server for the voice chat. At the end of each round we met at a channel, discuss the responses and forced effects and then divide into our own chat channel.

It works pretty well and the second try brings us the victory with Annûminas 47 / 60 health after 14 turns. It was truly epic and all of us had a great time.

It was 47 out of 60 (Niklas and I build up some defense ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) so not even close :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Great quest and truly a great experience everybody should try out if they get enough people together to play epic multiplayer in real life or via OCTGN.
