The reviews for this game are up for anyone who is interested, and apparently it's very very good. 9.3 from IGN.

I'm really looking forward to this game! The story seems really cool and I just love the idea of riding a Warg. Also I find this Celebrimbor story intriguing.

I am picking it up 100%. I am always looking forward to LOTR video games and, at last, this one seems to have got rave reviews.

Here's hoping my computer doesn't choke on it next week.

 

The nemesis system definitely seems pretty cool. And it'd be an interesting idea to bring into the LCG, enemies that follow you, bringing burdens with them based on how you beat them in the past.

NEVER trust IGN. They are an extension of marketing departments, not journalists. I'm waiting on some of my fav reviewers in youtube to post a review I can trust.

 

That being said, this looks like a fine game, even though I am not a fan of Assassin's Creed-like combat.

The combat is actually Arkham style not Assassins Creed style. As in, the same engine pretty much. Which is great because Arkham is some of the most fun I've had in a game.

It's turned out pretty well on metacritic too. Everyone seems to be praising the Nemesis system. I hope this game does well. There haven't been many Lotr games recently.

Yeah me too, and personally I think War in the North looked great but in the end was extremely boring..

War in the North is only worth playing if you can do it co-op with someone. Then its pretty fun hack and slash, and you can both make fun of the terrible dialogue and plot together.

## 11 [Raven1015 on September 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122980-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/?do=findComment&comment=1279827)

Actually, for those who care about the lore, I found War in the North to do the best job of any lotr video game (barring lotro) in respecting and letting players explore the lore. Elladan and elrohir talking about Celebrian being kidnapped, Arwen sewing the banner at rivendell, gloin talking about his adventures with bilbo, etc. I suppose if you don't care about lore, then the gameplay could be a bit repetitive.

Yeah, but heroes talking with Smaug? A Dwarf lair in the Misty Mountains somewhere... So far for lore..

But it was indeed one of the few games who did listen to lore a bit.

gandalfDK, that dragon was not Smaug. His name is Urgost and was made up, just like some characters in LotR LCG. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah okay, haven't played the game for a longlong time, but imo it ought to represent him. And Agandaûr was also not really lorelike.. 

And the Eagles, and the whole Radagastpart and I could go on and on. 

 

But, as I said, it certainly took lore into the game. (Third Age was worse)

 

Just looking forward to this game, the (madeup or not) story about Celebrimbor is really intruiging. Also the combat and nemisis/domination system looks cool!

I thought that Battle for Middle Earth II (Xbox 360) was an excellent game. I still play it from time to time. There was also a game called Guardians of Middle Earth that did well.

## 16 [gandalfDK on September 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122980-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/?do=findComment&comment=1280238)

Yeah, BFME II and it's expansion pack Rise of the Witch-King were cool! I've got them still installed. I really liked the Age of Empires related playstyle, but instead of 1 unit you created a whole squad. The different factions to choose from and all those different units are cool to play.

Guardians of Middle-Earth for the PS3 I thought meeh. Not very much people played the game, and you needed to wait for hours until you could play a game. And actually it was just League of Legends with a LotR sauce over it.

## 17 [Raven1015 on September 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122980-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/?do=findComment&comment=1281039)

I think there's a difference between adding stuff to Tolkien's world that fits in with his overall vision and that could possibly exist, which is what I think War in the North did with Agandaur, the Eagles, etc. (and which is what LOTR LCG does as well), and adding stuff that seems contradictory to something Tolkien would write, which is where Shadow of Mordor falls for me. I've said before that I'll play it and I will, but the whole idea of a fallen ranger being possessed by an Elf wraith and using wraith powers to mind control orcs is about as far removed from Tolkien as anything else I can imagine. To me, adding stuff doesn't mean going against lore necessarily, it's all about how it's done.

Of course, I'm still going to buy and play the game, so I suppose that makes me a bit of a Tolkien lore sell-out! Oh well.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

That was indeed an eyeopener of some sort.

When you think about it, the socalled lore in SoM does really not make sense.

Celebrimbor lingering as a wraith in Mordor.. That already does it.

There seems to be a sort of witch ruling a part of Mordor and giving you advice how to fight Sauron and those brainwashed Orcs, it indeed isn't really Tolkienish..

But, I didn't like how WitN added their lore that much and the gameplay certainly didn't help the game. Only the name Agandaûr was cool to speak out loud, but the part with the dgon was not my cup of tea.

But like LotR LCG I played it anyway for my unstopable craving for lore, as will I play SoM. Something in me jusy wants to know anything there is to know about Middle-Earth and especially about its inhabitans, canonial or not, and imo LotR LCG does this really well, except maybe KD/Dwarrowdelf. The scenarios are really cool and feel 'right' and the designers have done a great jobr in that point of view.

So anyway, SoM is about to hit the stores in two days here. Looking forward to playing it.

Now I've only read Fellowship and half of The Two Towers but none of it sounds that lore breaking to me. Just because he didn't write it doesn't mean it can't be. Lore-nerds just can't handle that fact. I don't really care if it does or doesn't break the lore though since I hate Tolkiens writing and if it wasn't for the movies I wouldn't have ever gotten into LotR.

Hahaha, that last sentence just made me laugh really hard. Sorry if that offends you, but there are not many people who play this game and don't like the Professor his writings. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Since you didn't read all of the story and certainly not the Silmarillion or Unfinished Tales, it may be a bit hard to explain, but there never was a Ranger who was occupied by Celebrimbor his ghost in the years after the end of the so called Watchful Peace. This would have been a too big of an event to leave out, even for Tolkien (who forgot about a lot of his own tales if you ask me) 

And it's also not about lore-breaking, but about the possibility for a story to be true. Maybe I am a lore-nerd, but I think more of that like a compliment than anything bad.

WitN was indeed less lorebreaking then SoM as far as I can see for now.

The only human who was ever granted a second chance at life after dying was Beren. Coming back to life just does not happen for mortals, no matter the method, in Tolkien. 

 

Elves go to the Halls of Mandos after death, and are eventually returned to their old bodies (unless they've done something really terrible), but almost always stay over in Valinor rather than returning to Middle-earth. Celebrimbor should not and could not be a wraith, because he is off living in Valinor in his old body during the time of the story. 

 

As I said before, most "lore nerds" don't care about adding to Tolkien, it's directly going against Tolkien's rules for the world he created that is annoying.

For those interested in a trailer.

 

As for Ian, in Dutch we've got a saying 'baas boven baas' which could be translated in english in this particular situation: "Every nerd meets it's match." ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

You explained everything going through my mind. 

And as a matter of fact, other then Barrow-wights, the Army of the Dead and the Nazgûl, no such thing as a Wraith of Wrath exists in ME. And they depict Celebrimbor wielding a Ring of Power in the Battle of Dagorlad, which we know of were not kept by him, just the opposite is true; Gil-Galad may have wielded Narya and Vilya during this battle but certainly not Celebrimbor.

 

Magic, as for such needed to 'dominate' Orcs as it is called, has always been a thing in Tolkiens works that are only used few times and in great need of help. Even Gandalf, in the end the mightiest of the Istari, rarely uses his powers. The ones who do use magic and such things are often found at the wrong side of good and bad, like Saruman and Sauron. So Celebrimbor his wraith giving a power to posses other beings (which is all wrong, for Elves never would want to posses other liveforms, (edit) even if it be an Orc) to a Gondorian Ranger.. Well, fill in the other gaps for yourself because I think I elaborated a bit to much about this subject. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

This is the attitude that I think is soooo stupid. "Tolkien didn't write it so it can't have happened!" Just admit that you will never be happy with anything that wasnt actually written by Tolkien. I believe that as long as he never said that it didn't happen then it could have.

Hmm.. I don't know how to reply... Tolkien didn't write about how I should respond to anything that he didn't write.

I find your answer a bit offending in my turn. I am not going to admit to a statement or opinion that has been given to me and is not mine at all. In fact it doesn't matter to me that much. If I was going to admit to something stupid as you stated above, I wouldn't even be playing this game, let alone attend this forum.. In the funny debate that I was having about lore in video games we were just talking about which game broke the lore more than others. To quote myself I play them all for my lorecraving " especially about its inhabitans, canonial or not, ".

You can make a story inspired by another created world or series, but if you're going to actually make it in that world (Middle Earth in this case), you're doing an interpretation of it, and you're not doing a good interpretation if you go against what has been written of that world without giving a good explanation for it. Sure, you can make whatever fanfiction you can using names and places of Middle Earth, and the story on its own can be good, but that doesn't mean work as an adaptation is good, since it contradicts the canon. Without knowing much about the game, but based on what had been said about it here, it seems the developers didn't even research enough to know a dead elf as a wraith (FFG has done this, Lost Soul of Lorien) is somethng that does not happen, or at least didn't give a good justification for it.

 

And that is why I always say, why do fanfiction? If your story is good and you're not going to do enough research so that there's no incompatibility with the source material, why make it then? Why does it have to be in Middle earth at all? Why not create your own universe? But that's another discussion.

I am ok with spin-offs and derivative works bending the lore a bit, because its basically glorified fan-fiction: and fan fiction never really fits in with the established setting. That doesnt mean its bad to indulge in it however. I mean, how many times can we retread the same story? I'd rather have made up stories instead. Just take it for what it is, a non-canon delightfully indulgent video game.

So I have had my hours with this game and man I love it. (disclaimer, I may spoil ahead)

The lore.. We talked about that and I might even say it is worse..

The gameplay and the game itself.. AWESOME!

I can't stop myself from yelling Lets Hunt some Orc! every time I go out on a mission. The killing of Orcs is satisfying. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] But I'm making a mistake, the game talks about Uruks, being a stronger breed of Orcs.... (in ME these words should mean the same)

And when I jump into battle Baruk Kazad escapes my mouth. The story is also cool, I like the missions with Gollum (I also love Gollum in this role very much, and hearing him speak and even sing is a lot of fun) I think the designers did do a cool job on the Orc-society.

I already bought a Season Pass for 10 euros, and I love to see the Hunter DLC too!

Very interesting discussion... I can't describe myself as a "lore nerd." I've been through The Hobbit and the LOTR a couple of times, but have failed miserably to make it through the Silmarillion. Therefore, I don't really feel qualified to make a strong statement about the validity of the lore, but I'll echo GandalfDK in saying the game is really fun.

Creeping along the ruins drop assassinating an orc from above before putting arrows into the two nearby orcs that witnessed it before they can do anything is awesome. The nemesis system is also pretty interesting (though I've yet to manipulate it very much).

The lore may indeed be questionable (or even completely broken), but I've found it to be a very fun game.

I spent much of the weekend playing and got up to the Sea of Nurn. Gotta say, game owns bones and will probably be my game of the year if the new Dragon Age and Assassins Creed games don't knock it out of the park. This is just super fun as an orc murder simulator and when you get that one orc who keeps coming back after you it can get pretty intense.

Yeah, I agree. And finally killing that one Orc you just couldn't beat is really cool! I'm still at the Black Gate, but the textures are really great! Ac in Paris... Meeh..

Just finished the game and everything related to it, except for hunting challenges (couldn't find that dire warg, and didn't bothered to because already beaten the game). Medicore, one-time slasher, nothing more.

What system did you play it on? The Nemesis system is greatly nerfed on the 360 and PS3 and without it I think the game would be pretty lackluster, fun Arkham-style combat notwithstanding.

PC. That nemesis system you're talking about is something presented as complicated in a good way, but is extremely simple in the end. Notable orcs just remember what happened, which is done by simple variable manipulation. The only thing I actually enjoyed in this game was Ratbag, and they have removed him in most stupid and ungrateful way possible.

 

What freaked me out most of all, is the bestiary. Why invent those warg-like creatures if LotR already has wargs? Why invent those "totally not ghouls" Ghuls while LotR has so many different cool kinds of undead already? Why with all that variety of orc faces and stuff, 99% of men in the game are bald, shaved, have the same face, wear the same clothing?

I will have to agree with MNT on the whole. Especially the beasts! I was really looking forward to riding Wargs! Why those Caragors? And fighting Trolls would have been so much more fun than Graugs..
Do you own a Season Pass? I do, so I'm hoping the DLCS will be great

No, I don't think that DLC's will add something really fresh to the game, just another mob of orcs to slice through.

Simple or complicated does not make something better or worse, personally I thought it added something really cool to the game. Levelling up and being decent at the game removes some of the fun though as dying is part of what makes it interesting.

 

I honestly think that when it came to wargs and trolls, they wanted to go complete movie license but weren't allowed to. While Jackson and his company did collaborate on the art design for the game I think they weren't willing to let them copy the designs for wargs and trolls for the movies.

> No, I don't think that DLC's will add something really fresh to the game, just another mob of orcs to slice through.

 

 

They announced a DLC where you play as Celebrimbor when he was still alive that sounds like it could be interesting. I hope they change up his combat style slightly, like the differences between Batman, Robin and Catwoman in Arkham City.

They could design their own wargs and trolls, it's not a big deal. And the Gollum was exact copy from the movie, by the way.

You can call the system cool, but its nothing special. Technically, it's the only thing that keeps this boat afloat and prevents it from being a complete boredomfest. Dying is not what makes the game interesting, being hard to stay alive does.

Man, finished the game today and I will not spoil, but I definitly did not like some things they did there.

At least were sure there will be a sequel! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also indeed did not like the way the let Ratbag leave play....

Yeah. He just left for the sake of it. Worst way to remove a character.

It could be a sequel, but also could be a massive dlc.
