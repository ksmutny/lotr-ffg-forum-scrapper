When i reveal a locaion and this location already exist a iqual location in stage area how i treat the iqual location ?

One of the equal  location is discarted or the iqual locations  remains on the stage area and count treat?

Ignore this please, the right question is:

 

 

When I reveal a location and this location already exists in the staging area, that counts twice? Should I add the threat of both locations and travel one by one after I explore the first one?

 Have you ever lost an shoe or you keys and searched the same place 3 times before finding it on the third time. I think having to explore the same location multiple times isn't too much of a stretch for the theme.
