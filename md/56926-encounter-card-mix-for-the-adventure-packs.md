Like they did for the Core Set, are there any listings for the number of different Encounter cards in the Adventure packs, just in case a couple of sets get mixed up?

No official listing, but you can find it onlotrlcg.com [http://lotrlcg.com/]. Select Encounter Set in right side and click Build. There you can find all card from selected set and their number in that AP. Like

Shadows of Mirkwood
68
[A Journey to Rhosgobel]
x4 - this is the number you are looking for.
