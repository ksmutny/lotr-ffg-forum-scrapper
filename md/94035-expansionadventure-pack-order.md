Where can I find the release order for the game?

 

As a new player I'd like to experience the game in the correct order.

here is the list i always give. this is the correct order

 

 

firstly, in order to play.....

 

mirkwood cycle needs = none...just core set

dwarrowdelf cycle needs = khazad dum deluxe pack

against the shadow cycle needs = hiers of numenor deluxe pack

 


here is the list in order of what i got them (i have played since core set release so these are correct)

 

core set

MIRKWOOD CYCLE

hunt for gollum

conflcit at the carrock

journey to rhosgobel

emyn muil

dead marshes

return to mirkwood

 

khazad dum deluxe

DWARROWDELF CYCLE

redhorn gate

road to rivendell

watcher in the water

the long dark

foundations of stone

shadow and flame

 

hobbit saga pack 1 and 2 (these were released one before and one after the follow pack i list in the uk...it doesnt really matter here as saga packs dont follow any order compared to the expansions)

 

Hiers of numenor deluxe

AGAINST THE SHADOW CYCLE

the stewards fear

the druadan forest

encounter at amon din

assault on osgilliath

blood of gondor

morgul vale

 

Black riders (lord of the rings saga pack 1) is out....again in between a cycle but again it doesnt matter as it saga pack

Next question..

 

I'm in the process of acquiring all the packs/expansions.  

 

Should I play them in order only using the cards that become available for the spheres as I go or can I build my own decks from the "complete" set?  Would doing this make the game less challenging/ruin the intent of the progression?

Including later cards in your deck will definitely make earlier scenarios easier. Whether or not you do so is up to you. It is definitely possible to beat all of the scenarios in the game using only player cards that were available as of that release. The progression series of videos limits itself to only player cards that were available and provides some great examples of winning deck-building and strategy:

I also have a series on my blog called Beorn's Path, in which I build two decks from the core set, and slowly evolve those decks through the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle:

Good luck!
