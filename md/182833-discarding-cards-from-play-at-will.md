Hello.

 

Can I discard cards controlled by me from play at will?

 

For example: I have a Steward of Gondor in play and another one in my hand. I'd like to discard the one in play in order to make it possible to play the one in my hand on another hero (cannot do it without getting rid of the one currently in play because it's unique).

 

Thanks in advance.

No, you can't discard an attachment or ally unless a card tells you to do so.  The one exception is with restricted attachments since you are only allowed to have 2 at a time.  You can play a third one, but then must discard one of the other 2.

Well... if you're playing completely alone very late at night with no witnesses around you, why not do it?  :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

Thank you! Your example with "Restricted" removes all my doubt about this. After reading your answer I went and re-read "Restricted" and "Unique Cards" sections of the rules consequently and it's very clear in comparison.
