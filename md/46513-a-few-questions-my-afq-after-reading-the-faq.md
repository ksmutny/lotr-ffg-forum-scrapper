# [A Few Questions, my A.F.Q after reading the F.A.Q. :)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46513-a-few-questions-my-afq-after-reading-the-faq/)

I read the F.A.Q. that was made (its on page 2, maybe a sticky should be made for it) and I felt it was very good.  I have a few questions that were not on there though that came up while we were playing yesterday.

1.) Must all locations be explored before you can progress past a quest.  Example: We are on 1B of passage through murkwood and we have the Necromancers Pass, but we have not explored it but we have the 8 needed progress tokens on it, can we go to 2A?

2.) I assume from playing that all enemies in the staging area remain when you progress in a quest, example the eastern crows are in the staging area and we have the needed 8 progress tokens to move on, so we go to 2B and begin reading that and the crows remain until defeated?

3.) Has anyone tried more than two players with one core set using one sphere decks?  Just curious how it went.  I assume the first quest would be easy, but as the second one actually brings on greater risk with more players and I have not done the third quest yet.

ALSO I am NOT looking for house rules, these must be based on official rules as the game is intended to be played.

Thanks,

Soulbearer

1) No you still progress as soon as you complete the requirement for the quest, it happens right away.

2) They all stay there as is and continue to engage/attack etc.

3) We played 3 player last night, one player it was their first game, we only used the mono sphere decks, spirit, tactics, leadership. We played scenario 3 and beat it. It was tough and fun. Gimli with 4 damage, dwarven axe helped us kill the Nazgul in one hit, that and a timely Gandalf.

Awesome, thanks for the confirmation on those questions.  I am glad it worked with a third player using one sphere decks.  I really want to try that and go through all 3 quests.
