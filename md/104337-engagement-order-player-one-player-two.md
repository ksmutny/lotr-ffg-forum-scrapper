Play using two handed. If first players threat is higher than attacking enemy and second player is not, can the second player optionally engage that enemy to save 1st player from getting hammered? One of my players, usually quests while the other hammers away.

Short answer is yes, but it depends on how many enemies you've got up there in the staging area.

 

-First player can choose to optionally engage ONE enemy in the staging area (or none!).

-Then, second player can choose to optionally engage ONE enemy in the staging area (or none).  And so on for 3rd and 4th player.

-Then, first player makes forced engagement checks.  If there are any enemies left, he has to make an engagement check.

-Then, second player makes forced engagement checks...

 

And so on until there are no enemies left that you are forced to engage.

Thank you. I asked for several reasons, that you covered.

Another reason i asked was CatC. If second hammer player was below whatever all those trolls levels are and my questing was above my quest characters are going to get hammered, even if i have a snare or two, bcecause i can't use snare until next round.

That question is actually different than the one you answered, just because my quest deck is toast. I'm not asking a question here, just trying to figure how i let my quest deck get so high, and why i didn't bring them out one at a time. Stupid, stupid stupid on my part. All those trolls. Ouch.

You answered my questions great. Thank you.
