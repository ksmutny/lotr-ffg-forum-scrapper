I haven't seen any info at all yet, so haven't got a clue what it's going to be about, but I've just seen a photo of what looks like our next expansion -- The Heirs of Numenor.

You can see it on the Cardboard of the Rings page, taken at GenCon -- www.facebook.com/CardboardOfTheRings [https://www.facebook.com/CardboardOfTheRings]

the front cover has got Minas Tirith on it -- the bit where the rock juts out. So it looks like we will be heading there at least… looking foward to that

i should hope we should! would be a bit of a poor gondor cyle if we didnt lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

on a more serious note i wonder how they shall portray the city…ie how are they going to slip it into a quest? a siege? perhaps stretching things too much?

i play LOTRO online, and the new Rohan expansion that is coming out isn't going anywhere famous (at least, nowhere that i recognise). Everyone wants to see Helm's Deep, but they haven't included it. I don't think they've got Edoras either.

So i'm used to being disappointed…

Woot!  Never been so happy to be wrong.  Great news.
