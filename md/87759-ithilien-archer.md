Quick question about the Ithilien Archer ally card...

 

On the card it states that if used to attack (and damages) an enemy, the enemy is returned to the staging area. Now suppose I want to assist my partner in a two player game and we don't want the enemy returning to the staging area (think brigands from the Peril in Pelargir for example...) If the enemy has 2 defence or more can I decide that the archer just assisted in bringing the enemies defence down and didn't actually damage it? So in essence can I decide which order the characters are doing their damage, which would give me the option of either returning the enemy to the staging area or not... (assuming they have 2 or more defence)?

The archer's effect is a "response" which the player has the option of triggering so you never have to send it back if you don't want to

Only "forced" effects on player cards MUST happen
