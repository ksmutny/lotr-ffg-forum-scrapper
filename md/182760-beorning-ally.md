I was trying to come up with some good Beorning allies, here is a neutral one titled Skinchanger, let me know what you think.

 

4 cost, 1 wp, 1 att, 1def, 2 hp

Beorning

Action: At the beginning of the Planning Phase give Skinchanger either + 2 wp, +2 att, or + 2 def until the end of the round.

 

I thought it would be fun to have a really flexible ally, who could change skins so to speak every round.

 

Here is a Tactics one titled Beserker:

 

3 cost, 0 wp, 2 att, 1 def, 3hp

Beorning

Response: After you engage an enemy exhaust Beserker to give that enemy -2 att or -2 def until the end of the round.

 

I thought this would give you some interesting choices, allowing you to neuter that enemies attack, or make it easier to kill, but you have to exhaust an ally to do it.

 

Here is a Leadership one titled Wild Beorning:

 

4 cost, 0 wp, 0 att, 0 def, 3hp

Beorning

Action: At the end of each phase you may pay 1 resource to ready Wild Beorning.

Action: At the beginning of each phase give Wild Beorning +3 wp, +3 att, or +3 def until the end of the phase.

 

Are these overpowered? or Underpowered?

I really, really hope they will happen. And it should be easier to design them because with smaller factions you don't have to worry about as many crazy combos. Still… designing is never easy, I guess.

 

I like the ideas, I will try to give them more thought later. Skin-changer is a great idea in principle, maybe a bit too strong as it is though? I am not sure...

The first one is perfect.

 

The second one does not feel like a Beserker. He is not attacking in uncontrollable fury. I suggest maybe Intimidating Beorning?

 

The third one has a lot of text for someone that is basically a 4-cost, 3 wp, 3 atk, 3 def, 3 hp ally. If you print him with these stats instead of giving him the pluses, he would be essentially the same (of course, there is small difference, but still). Also, he feels overpowered.

Your definitely right about the name for the second Beorning, Intimidating does make more sense.

 

Your right printing him with those stats might be more effective, though there are certain encounter cards like in Redhorn Gate and the new Lost Realm quest that could blank his abilities or blank his abilities, I thought this might limit his appeal slightly. Would 2 resources to ready make it easier to justify? or max once per round?
