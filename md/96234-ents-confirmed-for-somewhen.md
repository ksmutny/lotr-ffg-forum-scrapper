Here's a beautiful illustration of Leaflock by one of my favorite lotr lcg artists, Mike Nash.

I don't know when they're planning to using this, but something tells me Voice of Isengard, where he's going to be an objective ally.

Great find! Can't wait for this expansion.

## 3 [Legoland on January 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=944410)

Beatifull!

Bring on th ents!

## 5 [Gizlivadi on January 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=944419)

To be honest, this is exactly the kind of artwork I think this game needs. 

## 6 [Scroll Lock on January 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=944478)

It does not look very lotrlcg-ly

## 7 [Djenni on January 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=944482)

Objective Card or Player Event?

## 8 [kyrie on January 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=944488)

The question is: what is Leaflock?

 

Player card Hero or ally, or encounter deck objective? 

## 9 [Gizlivadi on January 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=944498)

Objective ally would be my guess. And yeah Scroll Lock, it doesn't look very lotrlcg-y, and that's the point. This game needs more light-hearted, fairytale-ish art IMO.

## 10 [richsabre on January 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=944500)

love the art!

## 11 [Karlson on January 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=944757)

I also think that art looks great. Somebody has to step up one of these days to compete with Magali's work as well! (Wouldn't it be great if FFG hired John Howe or Alan Lee?!)

Haha As cool as that would be, something tell me that since they've been working for major motion pictures, they might be just slightlyyyyy out of FFG's price range

Very true. Although, John Howe did provide artwork on several of the older Lord of the Rings games such as the circa-2000 board game and LotR: The Confrontation (one of my all-time favorite board games.)  I also think he provided artwork for a LotR card game that ran in the mid-1990's, but I can't remember for sure.

 

So perhaps it isn't a matter of price, but interest.  However, FFG does already have very talented artists that are doing a fantastic job, so no complaints from me.

> Very excited about Ents, but I can't get the link to work!

 

I am now having the same problem.  I would suspect that the artist (accidentally) violated some sort of agreement with FFG.  I'm sure they asked the artist to take the image off the site. 

## 16 [Bullroarer Took on January 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=946033)

Thanks! Such a good resolution. i like how this art can be taken independently, it reminds me of Lorwyn from Mtg... 

## 20 [Style75 on January 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=946263)

I love the art. I think it's important for the game to have a variety of art styles. While I really love Magelli's work, FFG should diversify the style a bit and this is a step in the right direction. One of the things I love about MTG is the wide variety of artists used.

 

I really hope "Leaflock" is in the VoI set and not one of the AP's. I want to get my hands on this card as soon as possible!

## 21 [Olorin93 on January 5, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=946308)

Thanks for posting! I too guess it'll be an objective ally, but I sure would love to put some ents in my deck permanently.

Yes yes we need boost for Radagast. Maybe with Ent deck Radagast will shine

## 25 [joezim007 on January 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=946623)

If you look at the last card on the VoI "About" page, Ents were actually sort of confirmed for the encounter decks.

Yes, we will see huorns in VoI for sure. But I think concrete ENTS will only be in adventure packs.

But John Howe has done art for Cubicle7's The One Ring RPG. Certainly FFG has a bigger budget than Cubicle7. I suppose that commissioning art for an RPG book is a much lighter ordeal than doing so for a game that requires so many illustrations (say 25-35 per $15 AP as opposed to ??? per $60 2 book set).

I doubt they'd do it, but I'd like to see Treebeard or Quickbeam as heroes with massive stats and massive threat, so they'd almost have to be solo heroes. 

## 32 [MyNeighbourTrololo on January 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=952114)

I, for one, don't think this art is gonna be on any card of LotR LCG. 

## 33 [Gizlivadi on January 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=952167)

> I doubt they'd do it, but I'd like to see Treebeard or Quickbeam as heroes with massive stats and massive threat, so they'd almost have to be solo heroes. 

 

Ent heroes with something like "you cannot have other heroes in your deck" but with amazing stats and abilities would be awesome. So that it would be a deck that if you lose one hero, you lose the game. That'd be great and would open many posibilities.

 

But actually, now that I think of it, I'd rather have this for the Wizards. So many people have been wondering how to make Wizard heroes, well, that'd be my answer. Imagine a Gandalf hero with awesome stats and abilities, and maybe produces 2 resources per turn, but it has massive threat and you cannot use other heores. Maybe a bit too much like MECCG? But for me that's a good thing, lol.

Hi everyone, I'm so glad you enjoy the artwork! Leaflock is easily one of my favourite FFG cards that I've illustrated so far! I'm looking forward to finally seeing it released!

Wow! Nice to have one of the artists drop in. Mike, do you feel like you can answer questions from the gallery?

## 36 [ZanzibarLand on April 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1052413)

"favourite FFG cards that I've illustrated so far!"

Confirmed or confirmed for a LOTR LCG card then? Sounds confirmed to me.

The artwork seems really lovely and could be a more mystery based quest rather than a typical combat one. Using willpower to quest and once an ent ally or enemy is defeated you put progress on leaflock? It could work, and I'd really like some radically different quests.

Pretty exciting seeing you here, Mike. I'm now super interested.

## 39 [Mike Nash on April 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1054865)

Hi everyone,

 

Yes it is the real me. Do you not see many of the FFG artists on here?

 

The main reason I'm here is because I googled Leaflock, to see if the artwork had been leaked anywhere. I was asked to take the artwork down from my website earlier in the year, as I'd released it too early! This forum thread popped up in the search results. I was very flattered so I made an account to login and thank you all for the compliments. 

 

I can't discuss anything that hasn't been released yet, as that's all under strict NDA. But I'm happy to answer any questions you have about cards that have already been released, or Tolkien in general. Although I'm not sure this is the right thread to do that in!

 

And yes, I chose the Gandalf avatar as it's one of mine and it's based on me! That's what I hope I look like when I'm pushing 80 or a grumpy old wizard.

 

Once again, thank you. I hope my future art for FFG continues to impress!

Were any special claims given to you about that artwork? Because usually LOTR LCG has different type of artwork. I am not saying it is bad, I really like it, but why is it so different?

Sorry for my bad English.

## 44 [Mike Nash on April 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1055129)

Why is my artwork so different, in terms of the LOTR LCG? I can't say that the art directors have ever asked me to paint in a particular style (unlike some companies). I can only assume that they enjoy the way I interpret Middle-Earth. I am happy to offer something different, if that is the case, yet I am always careful to be sure the art style suits the subject matter. With Tolkien, I try to capture a sense of age. I think that worked really well for Leaflock, which is why it's one of my favourites.

 

Sorry to hear not many FFG artists make it to the forums! Again, happy to be different ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Congratulations, your art is really really good. I like all the artwork in the Lotr-lcg. I hope it continues so... For example, i dont like the last image 'Captain of Gondor' because it is inspired in the film, 100%. Well, maybe one or two cards is ok, but i am happy about diferents ways of thinking the middle earth of all the artists that have worked here. ... Congratulations Mike!

## 48 [Gizlivadi on April 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1055210)

My problem is, if you're gonna illustrate your Middle Earth like the one in the movie, at least look up the concept artists that made that look, John Howe and Alan Lee, and while you're at it, you may as well look up some Hildebrandt and Nasmith. Those can be great inspiration material. 

## 49 [Mike Nash on April 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1055246)

Hmm, for the LOTR LCG, the artists are specifically told not to follow the look/design of the movies, as FFG do not hold the movie license. It can be tricky as the designs for the movies are often so effective. I remember painting the 3 Trolls, specifically trying to avoid making them look like the cave troll from the Fellowship movie (this was before the Hobbit movie). It was a challenge as I felt the cave troll worked so well and felt true to the book. In the end I had to design something that I felt wasn't as true to the book, in order to avoid making them look too similar to the movie design.

 

I agree, John Howe and Alan Lee inspire me greatly, looking at their pencil work in the movie concept art books is always a treat! They capture Middle-Earth in a way no other has been able to touch.

But it isn't common at at all in the Fantasy flight LCG forums.

 

So thank you Very much Mr Nash for taking the time to talk to us and explain some of the things. I am glad that the movie is not influencing the art because I like to see new interpretations (and I've already seen the movie interpretations).

When you refer to the three trolls do you mean those form the Carrock? If so I always imagined them (being based on the three from the Hobbit) to be a bit more sophisticated than the Cave trolls of the Lord of the rings and I felt the Carrock cards captured that well.

I believe it is the Hobbit ones, seeing that they are illustrated by him. And yeah, I don't mean no offense at all to Mike, but those aren't among my favorite pieces, I'm sorry to say.

Yes indeed, the Trolls I illustrated were the Stone Trolls, William, Bert and Tom from the Hobbit. So they were a different breed (?) from the Cave Troll in LOTR, but nevertheless it was still hard not to be inspired by it. I had to go in a different direction, to avoid the movie license. For some reason the artwork I created never sat well with me. I was so excited to illustrate them, yet when it came to it I couldn't find a design I was happy with. Perhaps I was being too pernickety. I shall illustrate them again some day, in my own time, and do proper justice to them. I try to illustrate anything from Middle-Earth with proper research and care. Unfortunately short deadlines, can sometimes interfere with the style and success of the result (as far as the artist is concerned). But that's the way it goes sometimes!

What's your favorite pierce of art work you've done for this card game? (OR at least, favorite out of the ones you're allowed to tell us about).

## 56 [Mike Nash on April 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1056600)

I'm pleased with the majority of cards I've created, but I do have a couple of favourites. As I mentioned in an earlier post, I really like Leaflock, I feel I managed to capture Tolkien in the way that I imagine it in my head i.e a sense of age, mythology and romantic legend. I also like Goblin Taskmaster, as I had fun designing what I think Goblins should look like. The head is actually based on a cat's skull. I later developed the idea with Eagle Hunter and tried adding bone piercings and dreadlocks as well as armour.

 

I also really like how The One Ring and the Arkenstone worked out. I choose simplicity for those designs. I felt the Arkenstone looked particularly effective once it was placed on the card with it's gold frame, that was a nice surprise! Finally, Smaug's eye turned out well, it was quite a quick card to paint actually, and I felt the mood and texture I managed to capture felt right.

 

All the cards I mentioned are on my website.

 

There are a few other cards due out soon that I had fun with too, but I can't talk about those!

It's awesome to have you on here Mike Nash!! Do you actually play this game?

## 58 [Mike Nash on April 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96234-ents-confirmed-for-somewhen/?do=findComment&comment=1057288)

I don't actually play the game no, but I always get a complimentary copy of all the FFG games I work on. I enjoy taking a look through the rulebooks and cards, checking out the artwork created by all the different artists! Pleasure aside, I'm also checking that my art still suits the product as a whole and is doing it justice. With that knowledge, I then move on to painting the next batch of cards!
