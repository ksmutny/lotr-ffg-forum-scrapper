Hello all,

I recently got started with this awesome game and I am liking it very much so far!

My collection is the Core Set (1x), the whole Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle, the Khazad-Dum Deluxe Expansion and both sets of the Hobbit Saga.

Now, I am already looking further to expanding my collection, but budget does not allow me to go through all sets in chronological order for now. However, I really like the setting of Sands of Harad and its cycle. So, my question for everyone out there who has played and enjoyed this set: Do you think the difficulty is okay overall, considering my card pool? I heard it might be a better start for beginners to jump into than the previous expansions (which seemed to offer many new mechanics and a higher difficulty). Or would you strictly advise against it? 

Any help is much appreciated! Thanks a lot!

If you check out authraw’s blog darklingdoor :

https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/ [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/]

there’s an article which explores sands of harad with a limited card pool.

some of the quests might be difficult but I think most could be done with what you have.

its a great cycle and I’d say go for it since it’s got good quests and player cards, and also very importantly it’s probably in stock!

also welcome to the game!

It's not too hard as cycles go, but be aware that there are a couple quests that might be a bit of a curveball in terms of strategy.

cycle vs. quests

You should be just fine jumping into Sands with that card pool. It's a great box, enjoy it!
