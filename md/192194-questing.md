No.

You can defend multiple times, but not against the same attacking enemy. You can attack multiple times, but not against the same enemy.

Can you give us the exact situation? If Boromir defends an attack, and then the enemy makes an additional attack, Boromir can ready himself and defend the same enemy again.

I'm guessing tactamir? He's not for questing. Put blood of Gondor and gondorian fire on him with Stewart of Gondor and he's for kicking @$$

Boromir /Tactamir can be helpful for battle and sometimes siege questing. He's been questing most of the time for me in the HoN quests... and then attacking (and occasionally defending).

There are cards that allow you to commit characters toi quest after resilvong questing, like Late adventurer or the Hobbit pony, or any card that can ready a hero allow you to quest and then ready the hero to give him action advantage (cards like Unexpected courage, Wingfoot).
