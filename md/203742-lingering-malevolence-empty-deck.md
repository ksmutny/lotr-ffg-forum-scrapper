The first sentence fails to resolve, so everything following "Then" also fails.

I LOVE seeing these two cards appear during setup in the quests they appear in, they completely fizzle and you get one less encounter card in staging to begin with!

Psycho

 

Freezing Blast is good but not that good due to Doomed 2.

 

but agree with you, effects like those are good in setup

Yeah the doomed 2 definitely still stings but its better than it appearing during staging!
