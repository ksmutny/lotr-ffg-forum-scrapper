Are the forums slow for you? Do you want to complain about them somewhere? Apparently there's a forum for the FFG Website itself! I went there and made a complaint thread, if you're having similar issues please help me out!

Complaint Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=169&efcid=2&efidt=783313]

If you do post there, please come back and leave a reply in this Lord of the Rings thread to keep it bumped!

oh yes, these forums have been aweful for as long as ive beenon them (about 2 years)….i remember i once had time to make coffee and breakfast before the page loaded…but slows good compared to what it was the other month. there was a week when hardly anyone could post, i couldnt get the page up at all, and the emoticons are still in spanish….

One would think that if their attempt to use the point system has failed, they would switch to some forum software that actually works, like phpbb.

i seem to have come across something that speeds the forum loading up..at least for me.

if the page isnt loading, open a second tab up and type in the ffg home page, when that starts to load the original page starts to come up

dont ask me why :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This board is unusable.  Someone post over on BGG when this is fixed please.

I find it very close to being unusable. It is a shame because I love the community here and now my participation in it is so limited (I try to read at least some of the posts and rarely respond as it takes so much waiting and I am not big on multi-tasking). Luckily activity on BGG's entry for LOTR:LCG is on the rise and Polish boards abut this game are also very vibrant.

I simply make bookmarks for every subboard I want to check, open all of them at once in different tabs, open another tab for looking at some other stuff while the board pages load, and then work myself through every tab that finished loading, opening topics I want to read in new tabs as well. It works well enough for me, although I realise that this method increases traffic tremendously.

Hmmm… Anyone else have success with this? I'll have to see if it works for me.

Bump!

People are still posting!

dboeren - "I've been a member of dozens of forums, maybe over a hundred across the years.  I've never seen any forum software as bad as this, or even close.

They are very slow, the "unread messages" light gets stuck all the time, "mark all read" takes forever and often fails to complete, sending PM's is extremely cumbersome.  They're bad in pretty much every way.

FFG makes some great games, but they really need to move to some different forum software.   I expect that a lot of potential contributors to the forum communities get frustrated by how slow and clumsy things are and don't come back."

Very slow forums …

( Consider this a bump)
