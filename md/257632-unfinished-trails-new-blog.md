Greetings!

I am creating a new blog for our great game.

unfinishedtrailsblog.wordpress.com

My first regular post is up and reviews the Gen Con quest from this year - Attack on Dol Guldur. Please check it out and let me know what you think!

Thank you!

Completely agree with you on Siege of Annuminas feeling like a better epic multiplayer experience. Attack on Dol Guldur was fun but you could really feel an invading army in Siege. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I love it so far! I've added your blog to the sidebar on my blog, and Unfinished Trails is now entered into my RSS reader for my commute.

I'm really glad to see the LotR blog community expanding again--we can really use some fresh content!

When I search it, I only find this thread. Has it been removed or so?

He have the link in the original post, who seem to work perfectly: https://unfinishedtrailsblog.wordpress.com/ [https://unfinishedtrailsblog.wordpress.com/]

It is so recent so may be he is not referenced yet.

Cirith Gurat hero and ally reviews! Loving some of the player cards from this pack. Thanks for reading! It's really great to see how much the player community has grown for this game lately.
