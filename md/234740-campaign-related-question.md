I've just completed Breaking Of The Fellowship with a stable Fellowship consisting of Scorpagorn, Gandalf and Spirit Glorfindel but now I've got to replace Aragorn with someone else. Does anyone have any suggestions who to replace him with.

 

The basic plan has been that Aragorn attacks things (with help from Glorfindel), Gandalf defends (and quests if I've got Shadowfax in play) and Glorfindel quests and attacks.

 

Any help would be welcome.

Without knowing your full deck list, Hama might be a good option.  Obviously, if you aren't running any Tactics events it wouldn't make much sense, but personally I think being able to recycle Feint with that deck is quite powerful.

That's a point. Since I haven't played any of the quests from this point on having a hero with his ability could be useful.

Boromir is always powerful, and could allow Gandalf to quest without Shadowfax, and action advantage is always very powerful, especially in ToS.

> Boromir is always powerful, and could allow Gandalf to quest without Shadowfax, and action advantage is always very powerful, especially in ToS.

Thematically feels wrong since this is literally the quest that he dies in!

How about Beorn? He requires no setup and can swing in for 5 from turn 1 which might help mitigate the loss of the -1 def from losing scorpagorn. I havent used him often just because he wasnt an interesting hero to me because i like to give my heroes a lot of attachments but when i have tried him his 5 starting attack has been pretty stellar. 

 

How is the campaign going btw? I always wanted to start one but kinda felt like the quests kinda need to have specific decks built to beat them. Especially later in the cycle

I decided to go with Boromir since I've rarely used him and action advantage was going to be a big thing in The Uruk-Hai. He certainly showed his quality in the quest. There's full write-ups of the campaign run-through here: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/page-19 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101752-playing-200-games-in-a-year-or-at-least-trying-to/page-19]starting at post #365. 

 

I was using the deck from http://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1693/lore-of-the-rings-alternate-fellowship-1.0 [http://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1693/lore-of-the-rings-alternate-fellowship-1.0](with a couple of Tale Of Tinuviel's mixed in for cards I've got less copies of because of having 1 core set) and it went a lot better than I expected (my track record with The Old Forest was pretty terrible but I managed to beat it on the first attemt) and I pretty much kept the deck as is until after the Breaking Of The Fellowship. After that I switched to a deck which is about 60% the same, which I'll change as needed for a given scenario.
