In Peril in Pelargir nightmare mode, Cunning Informant effectively lowers the engagement cost of all enemies. Let's say there is a Pelargir Ringleader in the staging area in the encounter phase, along with another enemy with higher engagement cost. After I make the first check (against enemy X), I engage the Ringleader, who brings in a Cunning Informant. I've already made my engagement check against the enemy sitting in the staging area, so would I make another and engage me due to the Informant's effect? I'm guessing not, but I want to be sure.

If you already made the engagement check against that enemy you don't have to do it again. You are safe for this turn and only have two enemies to deal with ^^

Dunno, could go either way.  I just came up against this in Tower of Cirith Ungol.  There was an enemy with 38 engagement cost, he engaged me and raised my threat by 2.  This pushed me up to 44, which forced me to engage a 44-threat enemy that otherwise I would have avoided.  You start doing forced engagement checks by looking at the highest-threat enemy in the staging area, so I already had avoided him... until my threat went up.

 

Now, the core set manual says that PLAYERS make engagement checks, and you just keep making checks until there aren't any enemies that you have to engage.  From that standpoint, yeah you'd have to engage, in your scenario.

However, player cards like Noiseless Movement write as if the ENEMY is the one making the engagement check ("...that enemy does not make engagement checks this round.").  From that standpoint, it seems the enemy might make ONE engagement check and no more-- so you would avoid engaging him, in your scenario.

An official ruling could easily go either way.

Reading the core set manual again, I think it’s pretty definite that you would need to engage that second enemy after all.
