after about a month of trying i finally beat hunt for gollum, with aragorn, eowyn and theodred. Was a close one, final score 50, but my northern tracker saved the day getting rid of locations, didnt realise how strong that card was.

 

anyway, nearly in tears of joy haha

Congratulations! Yeah, Northern Tracker is awesome. Definitely one of the strongest cards in the game, along with Gandalf, Steward of Gondor, and Unexpected Courage. Have you tried Carrock or Rhosgobel yet?

 Congratulations :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but just to clearify something, if the threat ever reaches 50 isn't it over then? I mean precise when it reaches 50 bum dead? Or do you have that final round to finnish off? This is not to question your victory just so I know the answer when I'll end up in the same situation :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I've found Aragorn/Eowyn/Theodred to be the best group of heroes for this particular quest. Great questing potential, which you definitely need and enough firepower to take out any enemies.

 Just out of curiosity did you play co-op or solo? I've yet to start my first game and am wondering if I should be looking for a partner to play this with.

Congrats.

As for the line-up, I find Théodred, Éowyn, Beravor to be the best for this one solo. I have never lost with them against it (I have not played it more than ten times solo, though).

OP, what is your deck, if you care for some advice. Of course, it may be better to find out your own way. As it is surely priceless the way you feel now after you have done it. Congrats again!

i won this solo, i havnt got my deck to hand but it mainly consisted of cards that reduce locations card values and upped willpower (favour of the lady, celebrians stone), also i love the dunedain mark and warning (+1 attack and +1 defend on aragorn is amazing value for 1 resource each)

Try replacing Aragorn with Imrahil and focus on Rohan allies in your deck, it works really well against HfG
