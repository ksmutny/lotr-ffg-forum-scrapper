COTR just uploaded some pics of the new Gen Con quest, The Ruins of Belegost, and an exclusive promo alt art Gimli!

While I personally know little of Belegost itself, other than it was a dwarven city in the Blue Mountains, I'm excited to see what appears to be a dragon or big drake boss to fight! Maybe an omen that we're going to the Withered Heath next deluxe/cycle?

I just noticed that they put the paper banner behind the stats unlike alternate Aragorn who just had white stats over the art.

I was hoping it was going to be related to the saga quests somehow, but it does look like a good adventure.

I was hoping it would tie in with saga mode as well but honestly.... Ruins of Belegost? Giant dragon/drake that is ffg created? The art we have seen so far and the new mechanic? AMAZING!!!!!!!

I'll be able to post more when I'm not in the thick of gen con, but the quest is really good! A classic dungeon crawl and treasure hunt with branching paths. Lots of first age references and a dragon!

oh man I think they have outdone themselves once again...... many a first age reference and getting to explore an area of middle earth never before looked at in-depth and never explored by any known or named characters. Could not be more excited for this one !!!!!

I guess it's linked "loosely" in that Belegost is in the same region, Eriador, as the current Deluxe ("Lost Realm") / cycle ("Angmar Awakened") but yeah, not a Saga one.

 

Looking forward to getting this one, hope it doesn't take as long to get to UK stores as the last Gen Con/Fellowships ones did.

Yeah, I'm only now getting ready to order Fog on the Barrow-Downs! This Belegost scenario looks fantastic, though. Great art and new mechanics! Can't wait to play it (in a year or so).

Quest about hunting for treasure and looting is a real Tolkien quest? Excuse me, sir, but from which universe are you visiting us? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Yes many lotr stories is about loot some treasures (hobbit for example). However I mean a place and settings… undergound, dragons, orcs and dwarfes abd treasures

The quests have been feeling pretty D&D inspired lately. But D&D and Tolkien share a lot of elements, so I'm not worried about it.

My ticket to play this quest is for tomorrow. I'm kicking myself, because I almost brought some dwarf decks with me, but then I opted for Gondor/Dunedain instead because of the current cycle. Oh well.

On this note...is it likely they will announce the next Deluxe and/or Saga expansions at GenCon?  Maybe during the In-Flight report?  

 

Ohhh...and the quest does look really cool!  Heard on the COTR podcast that it was very tuned for 3-4 players... I hope it is still fun solo.

I sure hope they will announce both. Probably even today we'll see the boxes on display like last year, and then a quick reference to them in the In-Flight report.

 

EDIT: Never mind this. Apparently the In-Flight report will be in a few minutes!

 

As a general note, I really appreciate all the coverage made by the various podcasts/shows. It feels like I was there!

This game is clearly dying. The last two years the latest deluxe expansions has been prominently featured at the In-Flight report and then nothing this year. Sorry guys, it's been a great run.

I wonder if we'll actually see new expansion teasers this Gen Con? Seems unlikely.

Ian might as well take over the game's design. He has the Turin cycle coming out and (possibly) a Tuor cycle to follow that.

Yeah...COTR's live tweet of the in-flight report had all of the other news (Warhammer, new Descent and IA expansions, new Eldritch Horror expansion, X-Wing, AGoT), but nothing was mentioned about any of the other LCGs.  It was mentioned in the report, however, that LOTR LCG remains one of their big sellers.  So not much reason for doom and gloom just yet.

Next box with be LOTR: the flame of the west. Would give more details if I had them but really Just no opportunities. Literally pulled out the box from by bag, opened it and looked at the rule book just so I could post the title

had a chance to play this quest last night.   If you're super-excited, you should be.   Very good quest, difficult.   You are going through a large cavern,  meanwhile being stalked by a large, mean, and indestructable dragon.  You're hoping to find loot cards which -in addition to many of them having strong in-game effects-   can bypass certain stages.  One playthrough we spent a long time looking for a map which incidentally, didn't exist (one loot objective is set aside at the beginning of the game).  But there is an alternate route you can take if you don't have the map, which we eventually found.  Midway through there is a "mini boss"  which I dont recall the name of, but its some sort of elder horror.   He was shredding the table next to us who didn't have much in the way of available defenders.

At the end of the cavern the dragon looses his "cant take damage" text and you go into the boss fight.  Beat the dragon to win.

From what I could see, nobody there was running weak decks,  we all stacked up several losses before getting through.

"the adventure continues in The Lord of the Rings: The Flame of the West Saga Expansion with scenarios that bring to life the events from the first half of The Return of the King"

 

Definitely the next saga pack.

Concurring with AWP832's comments, had my first run at the quest tonight and really enjoyed it. Did not come out victorious in the two attempts we made at it but the mechanics and themes of the quest itself are top notch. Lots of quest stages that are dependent on which of the cool "loot" attachments you've discovered create a tense questing dynamic and the variety of orcs, chthulu esque monsters, and the main dragon make for some intriguing enemy types too. Hoping it'll be avaliable soon for everybody to try because I seriously think it's one of the more enjoyably designed quests as of late. And not knocking what we've got, just speaking of how highly of how much I enjoyed the mechanics of this one

According to the guys from COTR, who probably asked Caleb about this, he will be included, so I think it's fairly certain to think he'll be in the POD edition.

If you look at the COTR post now, you will find that they edited it to something along the lines of "we do not know", so I guess it is unlikely that they have actually asked Caleb (unfortunately).

How long was it from the other Gencon decks?  Anyone remember?  I just got into this game now and I'm only missing this one pack.  OCD says "GET IT NOW!!!"

We usually have both the GenCon quest and the game night quest by Christmas.
