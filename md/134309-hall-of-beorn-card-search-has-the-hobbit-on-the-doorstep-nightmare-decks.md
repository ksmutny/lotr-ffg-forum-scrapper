Glaurung, have you tried Heirs of Numenor Nightmare yet? I read Beorn's success with Into Ithilien but did not see anyone commenting on the pack as a whole. I would be curious to hear what experienced players think of the HoN nightmare quests.

Yes I do. Accept the first one. I do play into ithilien and siege of (forget name). Both a very good specialty last one. There is more Battlefields locations and enemies a really powerful. Really play like a big setious battle even in solo game. Im pretty sure with 4 players us crazy epic.
