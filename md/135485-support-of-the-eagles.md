Lets asume I do have Legolas with a copy of Support of the Eagles and Rohan Warehorse and also Firefoot attatched. Two Mounts seem like a glitch to me, but counting the "Restricted" attatchments everything seems to be in order. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also assume,  I do have a Eagles of the Misty Mountains with e.g. 3 face down attchments.

 

If I am right the following sequence seems allright:

- exaust SotE, so Legolas gets +5 axes (to a total of 9 with Firefoot)

- declare Legolas and EotMM itself as a attacker, which means they both strike with a total of 14

- that 13 damage will kill something for sure, so put two tokens on the quest and exaust Rohan Warhorse to ready Legolas

- now atack with Legolas alone,it's still 9 damage probably able to kill two enemys with an exausted Firefoot

- another two counters on the active quest (to bad it reads at Legolas: per attack, not per killed enemy.. )

 

A Mighty Prowess could add two single damge more...

 

Do I miss something? This seems to be insane! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

E o.t.M.M

Eagles of the Misty Mountains cannot have restricted attachments. Eagles of the Misty Mountains gets +1 [Attack] and +1 [Defense] for each facedown attachment it has.
Response: After another Eagle character leaves play, you may attach that card facedown to Eagles of the Misty Mountains.

 

Support of the Eagles reads:

"Action: Exhaust Support of the Eagles to choose an Eagle ally. Until the end of the phase, attached hero adds that ally's [Attack] or [Defense] (choose 1) to its own."

 

Rohan Warehorse

"Attach to a [Tactics] or Rohan hero. Restricted.
Response: After attached hero participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, exhaust Rohan Warhorse to ready attached hero."

 

Fire Foot:

"Attach to a [Tactic] or Rohan hero. Restricted.
Attached hero gets +1 [Attack] (+2 [Defense] instead if attached hero is Éomer).
Response: After attached hero attacks alone, exhaust Firefoot to choose a non-unique enemy engaged with you. Excess damage dealt by this attack is assigned to the chosen enemy."

That's all legit.  It's very strong, but also takes a loooong time to setup.  You're looking at 4 cards costing 10 resources plus the cost of the eagles that are under EotMM.
