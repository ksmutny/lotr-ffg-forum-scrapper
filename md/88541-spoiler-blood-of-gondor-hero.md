Well her ability is very meh.  Generally losing a hero is the worst thing that can happen in a game let alone doing it willingly.  I suppose if she was going to die anyway it would be ok but it seems like a very reactive move rather than a pro-active one.  Maybe if she has a drastically reduced threat cost and could be used for secrecy but other wise looks like she can be added to the growing list of crap spirit heroes

Agreed.  The only other hero that willingly sacrifices himself is Tactics Boromir, but I've never done that because I consider it a defeat if any of my heroes die.  So this new hero's ability can, at most, only put in two Spirit allies that had previously died.  I find that to be extremely underwhelming.   The art is cool and I guess FFG is trying to round out their hero pool with more females (albeit madeup ones) but I am thoroughly unimpressed with this one's ability.

 

Hopefully the player cards and the quest itself are nice, though!

Indeed, id like to be able to see the ability of that tactics ally.  I'd think its a pretty good effect since he costs 3 and has low stats

Well, it is kind of a strange ability, but I could see that if you have Fortune or Fate (and a cheap way to play it like with Vilya maybe), or better yet Landroval on the table, it might not be a bad option, though.  I wish I could see what her threat, will and attack are.  I do like seeing more Gondor heroes.

edit: took out pointless part i realised would sidetrack thread

 

blah blah from edited out part..

 

 

the ability, i agree with what has been said, its a little bit 'ok-ish'...however the art is fantastic as usual

 

overall i guess im satisfied, i cant say i can complain when ffg make characters with great theme and art, even if the abilities arent amazing...the game needs 'standard' heroes that take thoughtful play moves

The more I think about her the more i dislike her.  You need to have 3 spirit heroes to even entertain the thought of using the ability otherwise you are just swapping one character for another except you will have wrecked your score and limited the number of resources you gain each turn.  So at best you are adding +1 character and still wrecking your score and limiting the number of resources each turn.  Also as it stands there are no outstanding spirit allies who this could even be used on.  Its not like its lore where they have Gildor or tactics with Beorn whom are practically the equivallent of having another hero.  Your best options are a few 4 cost allies like Elfhelm, Damrod, or Northern Tracker.  As if that wasnt bad enough, those allies need to be in your discard pile first so since there are so few enocunter cards that discard cards from your deck you either need to discard them willingly yourself (which if you're running spirit i think you are limited to Eowyn for this effect) or having them die in combat...something you will likely try to avoid if possible with 4 cost allies.

 

Unless her threat level, willpower, or atk are amazing i'd like to change my opinion from "meh" to terrible"

Landroval will not help since she discarded not defeated but FOF yes. It can be very special deck. Maybe interesting.

I think Rich is right in that we're bound to get made-up characters here and there for the simple purpose of prolonging the game.  If we did get the rest of Tolkien's main and secondary characters left and right, we would get all made-up characters afterwards which would bring the game down for most of us.  

 

However, I for one would rather have new sphere versions of existing characters instead of lame new ones that I'll never use.

Racking my brain desperately to find a use for her i suppose you could use her in multiplayer where the 1st player uses Caldara and two other heroes (whom they are or sphere doesnt really matter) and the 2nd player uses a  mono-spirit deck.  Player 1 uses Desperate Alliance to give control of Caldara to player 2.  Player 2 activates her ability and plays 3 spirit allies from his discard pile.  Player 2 then plays fortune or fate (its reasonable he could still pay for it as he still has 3 spirit resources incoming each turn...maybe even a good meal w/frodo to make it cheaper) and returns Caldara to play for player 1.  Resume play as normal

 

Seems extremely situational but it could be a neat little combo

If you are playing more than 2 players you could even have additional players use their own desperate alliance to increase the number of allies put into play for player 2.  Although this would require everyone to have access to spirit

Best case scenario you are paying 5 for Fortune and Fate (or Landroval) to get 2 allies that cost a max of 8 (since there are no 5 cost spirit allies).  Seems like a lot of work for at best a 3 resource benefit.  You're better off just using stand and fight.

 

Here's hoping the other stats are great.

I didn't think of that.  This would most likely be another Spirit-based card (maybe Neutral.)  As it stands now, "Fortune or Fate" is the only event card that does this and it's a cost 5 Spirit card, so any more of these could be useful for sure.

Without seeing her threat and willpower it's a bit hard to judge.  Certainly her ability is meh, but with Fortune or Fate around it's not so bad.  Multiplayer Spirit deck exclusive I think.  Can't imagine her being solo playable unless the WP is 3+.

 

Edit:  The rest of the stats were posted as I was typing.  OK, no way she is solo playable.

WHOS EXCITED ABOUT THE NEW DWARF CARD?!?!?!?! 

 

ha for real tho, dwarves, lol

 

The unique spirit ally is absolutely terrible.  Its like hey! discard 3 potentially useful cards from your deck to play this terrible ally for free! and only if you're playing mono spirit! yea no thanks.

 

The trap is awesome. looks quite cool too. another weapon for the rangers that will only be augmented with the long awaited Anborn.  

 

I like both the Squire and Guthlaf.  Cheap allies are always great and he literally pays for himself. chump blocker city.  Guthlaf is a cool addition.  Tactics will gladly welcome what should be a 2 cost ally with 1 WP.  His defense isnt bad either and may help in multiplayer

I like most of the cards in the pack, especially the new trap, Anborn and the squire. But seriously, STILL we don't get any decent Leadership Gondor ally to combo with Boromir? I think I'm just gonna burn my copy right now...

 

Also Children of the sea was obviously meant to combo with the silvan refugee... pretty decent.

I'm not saying this just to go against the grain, but i actually like Caldara...  I enjoy building decks around these so-called under-powered heroes and have built many decks that utilise heroes such as Dunhere and Beorn.  Also I can't remember the last time I built a mono-spirit deck so I'm looking forward to it...

I actually think she could be really good.  a 1/1/2/2 Gondor ally for free?  That's the best free ally I've seen (only other one I can think of is the custodian).  Discarding cards isn't really a bad thing unless you are worried about running out of cards in your deck.  And the discarded cards can be a good thing with the new hero or dwarven tomb.

Well she's not free, her cost are those 3 cards, just no resources.  The fact that shes gondor likely means little since shes spirit so unless ur playing mono spirit and someone across the table has leadership boromir her stats are still bad.  Odds are out of the 3 cards i'd discard theres something quite useful; it hardly justifies the play of the new hero and i'd rather save dwarven tomb and use it on an awesome card that i'd play twice (once from hand once from discard via the tomb).  

 

Maybe she'd see play in mono-spirit but personally i dont think i would use her

## 44 [Teamjimby on August 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88541-spoiler-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=840783)

I guess I don't view discarding cards from the top of your deck as a cost.  It's not like you had those cards yet.  Would you like her better if you were discarding 3 cards from the bottom of your deck?  To me it is the same, other than the psychological effect of seeing which cards you would have otherwise drawn.  If you combo with Imladris Stargazer you can thin your deck of the less useful cards.

 

Agreed that she's probably only playable in a mono-spirit deck.

I probably would rather them be at the bottom of my deck because i very rarely reach the bottom of my deck so i wouldnt get to play those cards anyway.  But great point with stargazer, makes her much more playable

I wonder why FFG decided to make ally cards recently of two real Tolkien characters - rangers that assist Faramir: Damrod and Anborn, but they made up a new character to serve as a hero twice so far in the "Against the Shadow" cycle.  

 

I would have much rather it been the other way around, personally.  Perhaps three Gondorian ranger heroes in one cycle seemed a bit overkill, but I wouldn't have minded in the slightest.  

 

Oh well, I'm still very excited to build upon my Faramir/ranger/trap deck with the new Poisioned Spikes and Anborn, but not as excited as I am for the Black Riders!

Okay this pack seams a bit of an up and down in regard of the player cards. For me the hero seems very weak. The player cards are a rollercoaster. Leadership got the best cards withe the ally and the dwarf event. Spirit has a good event and a bad ally. Lore got the best trap and the trap-recycling ally. Tactics got something interesting. Seems an okay pack, well will have to see how the quest is.

By the way Leadership got 3 cards!! Amazing

And i agree with Karlson, Black Riders rule!!

Whilst I partly agree, on the other hand, boosting many cheap allies is better than boosting one big one, for the Leadership Boromir. Plus, the new one combos quite well with Horn and Imrahil and Valiant Sacrifice (not that I am a great fan of either).

The dwarf event is neutral. The color itself kind if looks purple I guess from the hue of inside lighting, but there's no leadership icons anywhere on it

I still think Landroval would save Caldera if you sacrificed her for 2 free allies.  In that case it wouldn't be bad.  Otherwise, her starting threat and Gondor trait seem like a fairly good thing.  I don't know.  I'm holding out that something interesting will emerge for this hero.

 

Of course, anyone following Lore Faramir will have a tough act to follow.

But that's exactly the point; the squire was meant to be discarded, through chump blocking I suppose. He was not meant to attack, so you're just missing the point if you want to boost him with Boromir (and he'd only get +1 attack anyways).

 

At this point our only hope is to expect a large leadership ally, not many little ones since there's only 1 leadership card to be revealed (unless we get another global boost attachment which is very unlikely).

 

The perfect ally for this could have been the Knight of Minas Tirith, he's just perfect in almost every way, except for that restriction some dim-wit over at FFG decided to give him.

> indeed- perhaps you are correct grandspleen...i mean take for example if ffg hadnt spoiled light of valinor the same time as glorfindel..he would seem a bit rubbish. perhaps we just need to wait :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

You know better than this Rich.

 

Spirit Glorfindel without light of Valinar still has to quest 7 times before his threat even matches what it should be for his stats. How many games are there where you would quest with a hero that also has 3 attack 8 times? Spirit Glorfindel would in my opinion still be the best hero by an absolute mile without Light of Valinar, which is just broken on him.

So broken that I feel spirit Glorfindel actually breaks the game - he definitely makes everyone look at other spirit heroes with a slight disdain. 

Lets take a look at this hero: Threat 8: 2, 1, 2: 3 - fairly standard for a cheap hero. The ability is a bit lacking but I think it could be made to work.

For instance, you know that she's going to die to maximize her use you can use her to soak 2 wounds early, then use her ability.  Currently the allies we can get are also a bit limited (None of them particularly work with the Gondor trait). I think her best use might be to let you get back two escorts of Edoras, which would give you a lot of questing early in the game.  (It's +8 willpower). 

Her ability is slightly gimped by the fact she's been forced into the mono-sphere role (she'd be far better and more interesting if she could bring back 1 ally that matched the sphere of each other hero you had). It also wouldn't have seemed that broken if it brought back one ally for each hero you had (3 total).

Currently I'd probably have wanted her to get 1 or 2 less threat - I think if she'd been 2/1/1/3 for 6 threat with the same ability she'd have seen a lot more play, even 7 threat.

On the other hand, this ability is going to get better as the card pool expands and I happen to think it is very interesting. It lets you play a lot more recklessly with spirit allies, and it's easy to think of extra uses for it that might not be apparant without play.

She can defend, then sacrifice herself to give you two allies that are ready to also defend or attack for you (for example). 

I'm excited for her as a hero, even though currently we lack options in the spirit ally pool to really use her with.

As for the other cards; Most seem good; I'd like to comment on the three that seem worth talking about.

Poision spikes; I like the trap theme, but this trap seems to be rubbish compared to the others. Forest Snare, pit trap and the best trap (-2 threat and no engagement checks) are all better. 2 damage a round is just so much worse when you can't aim it at the target you want either.

A dwarf boosting card of any kind if unwelcome, a 0 cost discard two cards dwarf boosting card seems to be weak and unwelcome. It doesn't fit the dwarven theme or synergise well with dwarfs. They don't have deck manipulation to get the cards they want coming up next and they're mainly going to be full of allies rather than equipment. 

Combined with stargazer it would obviously be good if you set it up right, but they can't do it with just the dwarf trait. Even then, do we need to make dwarfs better in any way? (The answer is no: they're going to get some stuff from the sagas fairly soon automatically because of moria and gimli)

The spirit ally that you pay for with cards: This is amazing. Opening up a new mechanic for paying for cards with card discard instead of resources is a very welcome thing for the game. 

She's somewhat ruined by two negative features: being Gondor (the trait most associated with resource wealth) and being heavily tied into the mono-deck theme (you would never use her outside of a mono-deck theme because discarding 3 cards to discard a card from your hand is so awful you'd never risk it.

This is a potentially very interesting line of new spirit cards though (cards paid for by discarding). and I think in a mono-spirit deck she would often see play (with stargazer especially). Also you can discard the cards to play her outside the planning phase (in response to a bad encounter deck draw for instance) which is very valuable imo.

Yea.  You could play Caldera, Spirit Glorfindel and Eleanor.  Starting threat:  20 and great artwork.  Seems like that would be a pretty good combination with secrecy if you had some threat mitigation with it.  Light of valinor, fortune or fate, asfaloth, and you could make a decent deck, or so it would seem at first glance.  I'd give it a shot.

-Burning Brand would do its job (but Boromit would also need a song)

Throw the steward of gondor attachment on him and you can rack up a pretty nice atk value with gondorian fire.  Or run some eagles and support of the eagles can be an easy buff with even just one vassal of the windlord out

Man, if her threat was 6 instead of 8 I'd fall in love with her. Cool ability which you can use in endgame to gain that extra bit of advantage that you need. Let's not forget that some spirit allies have to leave play to trigger theri effects. Eomund comes to mind, but also Riddermark's finest and Escort from Edoras. She also comboes nicely with Outlands, giving you back all the d dead Ethir Swordsmen. And let's not forget that she can use Blood of Gondor to turn her into a defense tower of awesome!

 

Imagine you discard two Riddermark's Finest to place 4 progress on a location, and whoops, you can do it again!

 

Certainly no ability for early or midgame, but she might save the day when you're under pressure, like Boromir's ability does. Also, she can be recycled through Fate and Fortune -which isn't exactly difficult with a momo spirirt deck (sucks that I only hae one core set though). In theory that means that you can play two 4 cost allies for the cost of 5 resources.

 

Personally I'm glad that they quit creating overly powerful heroes in this cycle.

i feel as tho that combo of cards might be better suited for Eleanor if using that string of heroes as Caldara would lose the attachments when shes discarded.

 

I am kind of tempted to give her a try now however.  Trying to abuse fortune and fate along with dwarven tomb and map of earnil to ensure she never leaves permanently.  The resources to pay for fortune and fate could still be generated thru the aforementioned resourceful and stargazer/zigil miner combo (which would also help fuel which allies are in your discard pile).  Sounds like its token enough to give it a shot

UC = Unexpected Courage

 

I meant of course Blood of Numenor which is an attachment that allows its bearer to pay one resource to get + 1 DEF for every resource he owns until the end of the phase. Just realized that it's limited to only once per phase which is a shame.

Resourceful seems made for Spirit. The two Gondor chicks and Glorfindel will work well I think, as suggested above. And yes, put Resourceful and Blood of Númenor on Eleanor, and once you use Caldara's ability, you should still have enough resources, to buy Fortune or Fate, for instance. Questing shouldn't be too bad, defence enhanced by the Blood, and the combination of the Beacons, Out of Sight and Against the Shadow; the attack comes from the likes of Northern Tracker, Elfhelm or Damrod (who combos well with Caldara). This is certainly a very intriguing line-up, though again only made good by Glorfindel, and I do feel bad for having him in so many decks.

I´m not so disappoined about her...I´ll give her a chance.

 

With "Fortune or Fate" you can bring her back and with a Hobbit and "Good Meal" it should be no problem.

Also very nice to combine is "Desperate Alliance"... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

If you can discard 3 "Northern Tracker" before you use her, this would be a bargain buy.

Well, you mean to send Caldara to a three-hero Spirit team? It is intriguing but a bit complicated to set up, I mean you use her ability if you don't draw Desperate Alliance, unless, of course, you're also running a mono-Spirit.

Caldara should be in the Mono-spirit deck and the other players can maybe add more spirit-heroes.

Does anybody have a rule clarification on using Will of the West to cycle dead hero's back into your deck? If you draw them can you then play them in some way?

 

Given Spirit's sphere's ability to manipulate the discard pile, if this is a possibility you could potentially use her ability 3 or 4 times a game.

 

Incidentally, since you would probably go in with two tombs and two will of the wests in a mono spirit idea the new ally would work really quite nicely. Often it'll be cheaper and more productive to play cards directly from your discard.

An epic combo with Caldara would be to sneak attack Landroval and then use her ability, so you would only be paying 1 resource to get 2 free allies.  Of course, that means you need to gain access to tactics and leadership while running mono spirit, which is probably more of a hassle than it's worth.

Remember, you cannot use Landroval in that case, it is only applicable when a hero leaves play after being killed. But I actually think Fortune or Fate is an easier combo with it than Sneak and Landroval would (despite the latter being much cheaper, of course). The difference between having one or two cards ready at the right moment is often significant.

I'm happy that you got to see all these new hobbit cards. I imagine you sitting there like a child before the christmas tree. That picture really made my day. Keep that compassion! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The Landroval card says 'when a hero is destroyed'.  It is unclear what exactly this means in relation to Caldera being 'discarded'.  Is she sacrificing herself?  I interpret it to mean 'leaves play', therefore allowing Landroval to save her.  More importantly, however, is that Landroval has also printed on it 'limit once per game'.  So you couldn't do it more than one time.

In this game its always the worst case, so i am 100% sure Landroval wont be possible.

"Destroyed":is defined in the rulebook, it is when a character is killed by having damage reach the number of hit points. This one has been cleared.

Going back to paying cost by discarding cards, I think it is a great way to help the spirit player out drastically. To this point we have 2 different cards in the Spirit sphere that can generate resources and neither one is effective at all (imo). Still actually trying to figure out how to use the Miruvor card in a way that makes it worth putting into my deck and as for the Zigil Miner, it just seems like too much work and risk for the low reward.

 

Right now the spirit sphere has several cards that let us bring cards back from the discard pile including a card that lets us shuffle it back into the deck. With the limited amount of card draw and resource generation available, it makes perfect sense to use cards in your deck to pay for cards in your hand. There is still a certain amount of risk in it but I feel like you are better off in the long run just by having more cards out in play. Especially since that spirit has some of the most powerful event cards, it makes sense to save resources for those cards.

 

I would love to see an ally that allowed you to discard cards from your deck to reduce the cost of cards in your hand, even if it were only applied to a certain race or type of spirit card.

We already disscus this couple of years ago. So Landroval cannot help

Notice that all of the "made-up" characters are females? This is something that is bothering me a lot. I am not misogynist, but I believe the FF is simply making up these female characters to possibly get/keep female players into the game. Why would they do this? To make money of course! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

yes, when i first saw the hero i posted similar (but then took it out forseeing the arguments haha), but i do not know if ffg are doing it purposely....perhaps but i do not want to speak for them

i do know there has been some complaints in the past, but i would be dissapointed if ffg were doing it specifically because of this because, firstly there has only been a couple of these complaints in all of the game's history, and secondly there is many reasons why there is a lack of female heroes (which we all know so i wont go back into here).

 

i also do not want to seem sexist, but i cannot image that there is even enough of a female player base to alter the sales if ffg didnt do this (may be wrong...perhaps the male gamer is now a stereotype?...perhaps another time for one of my famous polls? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

 

perhaps ffg should make another male hero to balance things out again ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] (well, the created heros. i think they now stand at 4 female to 2 male? elanor, beravor, mirlonde, the new one to dunhere and thalin)

It is interesting logic about the female characters, perhaps it is true but my experience is totally opposite. I play the game with my girlfriend and she always prefers the male heroes, she hardly ever wants to play the female ones actually. And I think that makes sense for a heterosexual female. In a similar way, I hardly ever complain if the made-up character is a female, especially if the art is pretty (though true I never complain about good looking male heroes either, and I have no obligation to play them).

that is an interesting point...there is a long standing tradition of pretty female heroines in fantasy art ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png], one which has obvious routes....again not saying ffg is doing this, but its certainly a good point for a largely male player base

Ok, so then Landroval can't help Caldera, which makes her of even greater dubiousness in terms of being useful.  Pretty annoying.  But anyway, it seems to me that FFG is adding more female characters because Tolkien, writing in the early part of the 20th century and being a part of that cultural time and place, simply did not write a whole lot of female warrior-adventurer types into his stories.  Whether this is good or bad is a great subject for somebody else to debate in some white tower somewhere, because I don't care.  That said, FFG is making a game for the 21st century, where the roles of women have changed from Tolkien's day, so they're just trying to account for that while staying true to the spirit of the world.  I think they're doing a fine job, especially since Tolkien set the precedent with Eowyn being such an important warrior-adventurer already.  There just aren't a whole lot of *other* characters of her type in Middle Earth.  Also, male player base or not, both men and women like looking at pictures of pretty women (and to a lesser extent handsome men), so that means zip to me beyond that.  Fantasy is about ideal forms and images.  Pure beauty, pure courage, pure evil, etc.

Oh, no worries--I must have sounded grouchy there.  Not my intention, fellow Gandalf lover.  Anyway, I like the created FFG characters so far, both female and male, but I have noticed that it seems they don't quite give them the same game-impacting oomph as the Tolkien characters.  That's probably by design.

Morithain- I do see what your saying, and I am not sure exactly why FF makes up sexy female heroes. Perhaps some of the male designers of the game want some more eye candy cards? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Regardless, I don't mind that they make female heroes, I am just wondering why they choose to make more than made up male heroes. My guess is somewhere along your line of thinking plus the appeal to girl players. Anyway, of all the female characters in the game besides Eowyn (who is an obvious beast!), I think Berevor is the only other one really worth playing. Elenor is very good, but best played in a multi-player game.

 

"Fellow Gandalf lovers," (I like that Morithain). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Bring on more female heroes FF but make them better! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

As to this new hero, she is useful in a mono spirit deck on a last ditch effort to generate three allies in one turn where otherwise you would not be able to, say, have enough will power to beat a final stage or, if you needed a bit more attack. So, I can see her ability working in the long run, but very situationally.

Can she actually generate 3 allies?  I thought it was only one free ally for every *other* spirit hero you have besides her?  Which means at best she might be able to play Damrod and a Norther Tracker, for example, best case scenario.

Desperate alliance (giving a hero to another player) allows you to get more.

In solo play she can only ever create two.

Are you quite sure?  It's not uncommon for many dwarf women to be mistaken for dwarf men. (It's the beards!)

 

We may never know.

As long as they don't make up a female dwarf hero. I'm ok with the made up chica heroes.

 

 

(and as I love to be nitpicking - aren't all these characters made up? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )

Yeah, I was just about to point that out. Dunhere has a quote that says "Dunhere, chieftain of the folk at Harrowdale, was at their head." So I guess the count is actually 4 to 1.

Using her with Desperate alliance would be a weird scenario. The only way I can personally see it working would be if one person was using an all spirit deck and the person playing caldera was using only her in the spirit sphere, or her and one other spirit character. There simply aren't enough spirit heroes for two players to be going monosphere spirit effectively. 

 

So far I really love this hero. Just look at her ability as an advance of 4-8 resources at the cost of her actions during that time. If you finish the game within 4-8 turns (a good game) then you're looking at a good trade off.

 

I've already made one deck and played with her... but she died in turn two thanks to a shadow effect that caused an attack to become undefended.

Tolkien was writing at a time that gender roles were strictly defined. Women weren't fighting in WW2, certainly. Outside of Eowyn, which I am suspicious he felt super clever about killing the Witch King and gave her a fighting position for that reason alone, I don't think it crossed his mind at the time. I'm no expert, but I simply think that at the time of LOTR women didn't have place in Tolkien's war of the ring. This is archaic, and since I'm not a Tolkien expert I think I would've noticed if every hero outside of Eowyn was male a lot more than new female characters made by FFG.
