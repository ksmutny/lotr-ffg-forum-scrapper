So I might be reading into this too much but the newly released neutral player card "defender of the west" features both artwork of and a quote from Aragorn. It can only attach to unique allies however... possible foreshadowing of an Aragorn ally?

Would be strange, as Aragorn is the hero of the next Saga (and cycle).

It would come as no surprise to me, to learn that Aragorn gets to be in all 4 spheres as a hero and then again as an ally. It would nicely off-set the fact he also clearly will be getting 4 artifact attachments (which enable any of the 4 heroes to be all 4 spheres at once).

 

I also expect to get saga hero Aragorn and Neutral Aragorn at some point just because. In fact I would even be unsurprised to learn that a future edition of the game adds an Aragorn sphere. 

He does seem to be very popular. 

 

Edit: Maybe we'll get Bilbo sphere Aragorn too.

It's good to be the king.

I'd love to see an Aragorn ally, and I think we'll see one in the near future.
