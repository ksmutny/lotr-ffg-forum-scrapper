Just a quick one. What the hell is Rúmil doing here...?

Looks pretty much like a twofingered draw of a bow. Are you missing the bowstring, that is supposed to be of elfhair? Probably just too thin.

He uses bug extinguisher.

My guess was that he had a whip in his hand and was spanking Haldir or his loved one.

Maybe he is going to stab an orc or another enemy with one of his arrows. At least i have always imagined that he does that.

If you look at other art from her part, the bow string is just really really tiny and disapear when zoomed out just a little :

I think he's gonna use some magic to the bow string appear.

hahaha.. Yeah I don't see the slightest hint of a bow string and it has always bothered me a little ever since I got the card. I suppose it's just reeaaaally thin..

I cannot unsee it now. Thanks.

 

As for what Rumil might be doing:

- lining up a billiard cue shot,

- tying up Haldir's corset.

(Sorry for the dutch, it's some kind of stretchy candy/licorice)
