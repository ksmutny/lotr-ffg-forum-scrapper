I have 2 questions about starting the quest.

  Number one what do you do with a treachery card?  Does it go in the staging area?  If so when do you resolve it? 

  Number two if a card has surge after being revealed does that card surge so that there are 2 cards?

You resolve it's effects immediately, and then (generally) it is discarded. It does not get placed in the staging area.

If a card has surge, you immediately reveal another card and add it to the staging necessary as appropriate. Example: If you are playing a 2 player game and you reveal 1 card while questing, that card has surge. You immediately reveal a second card. Then you reveal the second card as normal (so there are now 3 cards instead of the usual 2).

So what do you do with Old Wives Tales from the Hunt for Gollum?  Would each hero lose a resource at the start of turn 1?

if you are talking about drawing it as a set up card, well seeing as they do not have resources yet they all would have to eshaust

i assume thats what you meant. so you draw your 6 cards, then flip the quest to when revealed- reveal old wives tales, then seeing as th resource phase hasnt happened you wouldnt have any resources
