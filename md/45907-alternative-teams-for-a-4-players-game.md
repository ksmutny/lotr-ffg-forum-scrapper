I just bought my second core set today and I'm facing a dilemma...

Should I make a deck or two to play solo or with my girlfriend? or should I try and maintain 4 decks to play with my other friends (a multiplayer game craving group, I might add)?

With the number of cards in 2 core set, 4 single-sphere legal decks are impossible to make, so dual decks seem to be the way to go.

 

Which brings me to my question: if I plan on making 4 decks, and if I plan on changing the initial teams, which combinations of characters would work better?

As anyone tried building 4 decks using alternative teams?

Building 4 dual decks out of 2 core set might be pushing it, but I wonder, in theory, what would be the best combinations.

Any thoughts?

 

Thanks

You need to think about heroes if you plan to make 4 decks.  You will have to run 2:1 combinations most likely.

2 tactics heroes, 1 lore

2 lore heroes, 1 leadership

2 leadership heroes, 1 spirit

2 spirit heroes, 1 tactics

 

Think about that restriction, and base the rest of the decks on that.
