Well guys, I am completely impressed with this set like all the others.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I have to say that the art in this set is my favorite so far, as well as the effects of the player cards and encounter cards.  The enemies are quite fierce and scary and the player cards are insanely good!  Yay! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
