Last evening we pondered over Dunhere and his capabilities when faced with Goblin Scout first and later the East Gate. The player who controlled Dunhere

had a threat of 25.

Facts:

Goblin Scout
Type: Enemy
Encounter Set: Goblins of the Deep
Threat Threashold: 37
Threat Strength: 3 Attack: 1 Defense: 0 Hit Points: 2
Goblin. Orc. Scout.
Each player with a threat of 25 or higher cannot optionally engage Goblin Scout.
 

East Gate
Type: Location
Encounter Set: Into the Pit
Threat: 7 Quest Points: 7
Gate.
Immune to card effects.
Players cannot optionally engage enemies and no engagement checks are made.
Forced: After East-gate leaves play as an explored location, add First Hall to the staging area.
 

Dunhere
Type: Hero
Sphere: Spirit Starting Threat: 8
Willpower: 1 Attack: 2 Defense: 1 Hit Points: 4
Rohan. Warrior.
Dunhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone. When doing so, he gets +1 ATK.

Sequence of combat:
Resolving Enemy Attacks
1. Choose an enemy.
2. Declare defender.
3. Resolve shadow effect.
4. Determine combat damage.
Attacking Enemies
5. Declare target of attack, and declare attackers.
6. Determine attack strength.
7. Determine combat damage.


My interpolation is the Dunhere enters combat at 5 step “Declare target of attack, and declare attackers” and therefor ignores the effect of East Gate and Goblin Scout, since the restriction cannot optionally engage enemies does not apply when he uses his special power correct? Or does the Immune to card effects. Stop his success at the East Gate?  What is a player card effect?

If not, does a not boasted Dunhere tactics eliminate the problem with buildup of enemies until the East gate is passed?

dunhere can attack enemies....it doesnt say anything about not attacking, at least thats how i see it, also his card effect affects the enemy- not the east gate....well id wait for others to confirm this or otherwise

yes, dunhere is awesome, this is not in doubt.. and yes he can attack into the staging area regardless of that encounter card....

ALSO remember quick strike

For Dunhere, anything in the staging area is a "eligible target” So you can use this card to attack a mob as it is drawn before threat counting for example. Run with Thalin and a few Marks, UCs as well if you can, and you should have very strong control of the staging area.

 Heroes do not engage enemies, players do.  Dunhere is in no way "engaging" the Goblin Scout when he attacks it.  Neither East Gate nor the Scout's text interfere with Dunhere, no more than they would interfere with Gandalf blowing up the goblin.
