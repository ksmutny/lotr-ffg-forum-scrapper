“Finally, Spirit players will be able to explore what it really means to be a Noldor Elf, with cards that introduce a new strategy for the High Elves of Middle-earth.”

 

It’s hardly a secret that I have been hoping for an Arwen hero in this cycle (and every cycle previous), but now my hopes are really high.  This weekend I was building a pair of Dunedain/Noldor decks for the new cycle and was making proxies and I realized that the hero for Escape from Mount Gram was Lore.  A number of people including myself have been thinking that we would eventually see Elledan & Elrohir heros in Spirit & Lore that would work together and with the previous incarnations.  So I began to worry that I wouldn’t get my beloved Arwen.

 

More fuel for the fire: we have seen every player card in Angmar except for the two spirit cards believed to be an ally and attachment from their numbers.  Are these cards being held back because they will give a clue as to who the Spirit hero will be?  (Arwen’s Attendant and Evenstar?)  And what is the new Noldor strategy?  Is it the Victory Display manipulation?

 

Other possibilities for the Spirit hero:

Elrond – I think unlikely.

Gildor Inglorian – I think we’ll see him someday, but now?

Erestor – as above.

 

What do you think?

Oh, I really hope it's Arwen. It seems like a good time to introduce her, seeing as the Deluxe box features Aragorn.

I think it's pretty possible that it'll be Arwen. On the other hand, I'm almost sure that the hero in Mount Gram will be lore Gildor. As you said, it seems that the Noldor support will feature this victory display control mechanic.

Well they had me fooled.

Merry being in Wastes of Eriador doesn't mean we won't get a Spirit Noldor hero down the line. Halbarad and Aragorn are Leadership and Tactics and the Mount Gram hero is confirmed to be Lore, so there's definitely room for at least one more Spirit hero in Angmar Awakened. I probably wouldn't play an Arwen hero unless she has a spectacular ability since I really like the ally version, but I see why others would want her.

Círdan, the ultimate lore break.
