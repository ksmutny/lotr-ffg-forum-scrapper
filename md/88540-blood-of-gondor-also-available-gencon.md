what kind of information did all of you think you were going to find in this thread if not spoilers

 

granted he should have put a warning, but jeez louise, he said a name which doesnt give you much.  wait till you actually see what the hero does then you'll really be disappointed 

 

not exactly "snape kills dumbeldore" material here

I was trying to figure out an interesting way to state something similar.  Well-done.  It wasn't exactly a ground-breaking reveal.

Wasn't so much the spoiled hero that offended but the OPs attitude for not caring.
