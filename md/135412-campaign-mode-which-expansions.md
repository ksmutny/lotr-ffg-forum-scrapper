If I understand it correctly campaign mode was first introduced with The Black Riders.

Can it be linked with some of the other saga expansions? The Road Darkens and The Treason of Saruman?

I guess you can't use the two Hobbit Saga expansions?

 

Thanks in advance

Correct, the actual campaign mode was introduced in the Black Riders and can be connected with the Road Darkens, Treason of Saruman and the last unannounced three saga boxes for The Lord of the Rings. 

 

The two Hobbit boxes are totally unrelated to the LOTR saga's. In the Hobbit boxes there are Treasure cards which bring those two boxes together as somewhat "campaign" as you "unlock" certain cards to use in the later quests but thats it so it's pretty lame.

 

As for the LOTR Campaign mode there are good and bad cards you earn, dead heroes can't be played later and therefore all later quests from those sagas are effected which is huge considering there will be at least 18 quests (3 from the 6 boxes).

Oh man, I hadn't realized they were all so interconnected. I need to find someone local to delve in to that with. Playing all the way through that would be an amazing journey.
