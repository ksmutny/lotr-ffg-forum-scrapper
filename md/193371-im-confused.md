# [I&#039;m Confused...](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193371-im-confused/)

So I have the core set and will eventually want to add to it. I've read that in order to access anything beyond the Adventure Packs for the core set, I have to buy the expansions and then I can play the Adventure Packs that coincide.

 

I guess my question is...why?

 

I see videos of people mixing all sorts of cards together so I'm not entirely sure why I would need to buy anything specific to make certain cards useable.

 

Can someone please enlighten me? My wife and I are enjoying the game, and I know she would be happy with some of the cards I've read about but I want to better understand this so I can make smart purchases of things we want and can use.

Later adventure packs key off of encounter cards that are provided in expansion sets (Khazad-dum is required for Watcher in the Water, for instance).

So, some quests would be unplayable without having certain expansions?

 

But what about the players cards? Would they be useable regardless?

 

Like if I wanted to get some dwarves for my wife (not a question I really ever thought I'd be asking...) could I pick up The Long Dark, Over Hill and Under Hill, and On the Doorstep, and be able to use them all together?

Player cards are safe.

So I can use any player cards anywhere I want, or are there some that wouldn't work correctly?

Yes, quests from the adventure packs are unplayable unless you have the corresponding Deluxe Expansion (except for the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle, because the Core Set is the "deluxe expansion" for that cycle).  If you did that hypothetical plan you mentioned above, you would be able to play all of the quests except for The Long Dark because you need Khazad-Dum.

 

You can use any player cards anywhere you want.  There are a few small exceptions in the saga expansions (like the Hobbit boxes) that can only be played in quests from those saga expansions, but don't worry about that.

Thanks for the unput. I'll start looking at what to pick up. I've checked a few buyer guides but I may stray slightly to get cards I think my wife would enjoy more.
