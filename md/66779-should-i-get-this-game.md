 How is this game? I am a big fan of LOTR but the two player thing has thrown me off a little. Could you perhaps give me a small outline of the game?

Yes, you should.

Two players are not requires. It can be played in a range from 1 to 4 players and is fun in every way.

The game can be played with one to four players, but is best with either two or one.  It is, however, very difficult, and more or less designed for expert players who have a lot of experience with customizable card games.  The Tolkien flavor is very strong, however, and winning the difficult scenarios can be quite rewarding.

 I have nearly every one of the "Tolkien" games from the last decade or so.  I won't say this is the best of them, but it is the best solo experience of them hands down.

Check out the video tutorial here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite.asp?eidm=129&enmi=The].  It does a good job of introducing new players to the mechanics.

this is the general thing that happens when you buy the game for solo:

-you buy the game

-you play using the pre made decks - you loose ALOT

- you despair thinking the 1 player tag was a lie

- you try deck bulding- you start to win

-you buy some packs and start to win some more

- the game becomes fun

-you have a decent collection and card pool- you are now both experienced and in the position to make powerful decks that let you win a considerable amount

- you are pleased you perservered

……….ok so thats a bit of a daft way to put it, but i think this is what most solo players go through. i personally have started 2-3 threads complaining about the solo play, and regret doing so. this game is great fun solo, the main thing to consider is can you bear losing alot until you have the experience and card pool?

if the answer is yes (and it really doesnt take all that long) then i would say yes, definatly get this game

Thats actually extremely accurate, lol. I would say this… watch the youtube video posted above. I bought the game, and after 2 reads of the manual was still very confused on a lot of points. That video was a life saver, and you'll probably want to watch it if you get the game anyway… so… why not watch it now to see what the game plays like, and if it interests you.

I'm a solo player, so, I can say that the game is challenging, but also fun and very fufilling. Most of the quests are really well designed, using mechanics that really help illustrate the flavor of whatever event they are supposed to represent. A few quests are a little weaker, seeming almost impossible to beat unless you build a deck specifically for countering them, in which case they become extremely easy to beat once you build around them… but these are few and far between.

The game has a good community, gets monthly releases, and I highly recommend it.

 I also would say yes. I'm a 100% solo player and bought it manly because of the solo part ( I ain't having anyone to play with :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

Also you can play solo in two ways. Normal solo playing one deck of cards or you can play so you are managing two decks. The later you play a normal two player only you play both sides which is still in the spirit of the game since you cooperate. This you couldn't do to same extent with ex. Warhammer Invation or Call of Cathulu.

But as said watch the 5 part video toturial. It'll convince you. I know it did me ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The video by FFG is good, however, I think this guy does an even better job.

 

He does a series called "Watch It Played" and he even allows viewers to be one of the players.

For all the reasons listed above and many many more, you should get this game for sure!  Are you a Tolkien fan in any capacity? Then I cannot think of a single better Tolkien product to invest in than this game here, especially if you like playing card/board games. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Hope you join up with the rest of us!

 Yes, go and get the game.

Agreed. All reasons above. The most important thing I can tell you though is if you are only interested in buying the core, you will be wanting much more as the encounter decks you fight within are all very hard without some of the later release cards. I own 3 cores, Kazaldum expansion, and the first 6 adventure packs (though any day now I will receive the remaining adventure packs from Dwarrodwelf cycle). This game is very fun either solo or multi-player. So far I have found no one who dislikes this game, and my friend's tastes all vary as to what board games of mine they will play and which they will not.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask, but I definitely recommend this game if your wallet is ready to make a commitment. I especially recommend this game, also, over Magic the Gathering, as I find that game has a nasty way of being more expensive and always desiring more unique and expensive cards. All cards you receive from these boxes are cards everyone else who buys the same packs will get; hence, this game is skill based, not "I own a thousand dollar deck so ha-ha, I win round 1!" Yeah, the very reason I sold my Magic cards lol

Hmmm magic is great game. Yes true is expensive but the designers of MTG is much better then designers of Lotr LCG. I will be happy if they will make some Lotr game. Cose most of the time Wizard of the Coast have a really good product.

But also LOTR LCG can be really cool. The idea of the game is briliant only work on the adventures packs is sucks most of the time. Look on the last pack FOS. This one is amazing! But this is  the first pack in the second cycle after RHG which is really solid done. What about previous ones like RTR, WITW and TLD??? Most of those quests is really low quality….. And half of the first cycle SOM is also crap!
