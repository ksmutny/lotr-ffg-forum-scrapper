Hello,

 

I fell in love with this game a couple of months ago. I just recently discovered that there were alt arts for heroes given out at past gencons. I’ve been trying every outlet online looking for the boromir and gimli alt art. I was wondering if anyone here would be interested in selling either boromir or gimli? I don’t have anything to trade, but would be willing to pay for them. Thanks!

I don't have those specific two (though I also am on the lookout for the Boromir), and It'll be very hard to find one. I don't think there are any for sale right now. -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]

Anyway, just so you have list, these are all the alt art gen con heroes released:

Aragorn

Aragorn (alt-alt art)

Legolas

Gimli

Faramir

Boromir

Celeborn

Galadriel

And this year's was Glorfindel

I’ve seen an Aragorn with white lettering in the top left for his threat, willpower, etc. is that a fake?

What you saw is probably a fan card and not necessarily a "fake." Many fans here have designed their own alternate art cards based on both the old and the fellowship designs.  You'll see these types of fan-art cards for Arkham and other games as well.

The Aragorn with the white text is the original alt art, I believe the one shown on Hall of Beorn was done by GeckoTH to make the Aragorn alt art match the subsequent releases
