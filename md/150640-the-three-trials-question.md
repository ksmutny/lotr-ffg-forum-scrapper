Hello!

On the 2b Quest card "The trials of perseverence" card, it says Each guradian enemy engages first player. Guardian enemies canot be damaged or leave play except by quest effect. I cant get my head around what that means... what is the quest effect? I am baffled  :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

It means any effect printed on a quest card: in this case, the text on 2B that states what happens when you control the Key for this trial.

So how would we control the key if it is attatched to the enemy that we cannot attack? I'm sure i'm reading something wrong I just can't figure out what

In the Trial of Perseverance, the Key is attached to the barrow location. It's only in the Trial of Strength that the Key is attached to the Guardian.
