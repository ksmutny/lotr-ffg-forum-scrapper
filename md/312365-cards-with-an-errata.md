The official FAQ (last known to me is from 2017?!) lists some player cards which got an errata. But (at least) on ringsdb.com are some more cards with a changed text - e.g. A Burning Brand. Furthermore, even the image has changed. So it seems to me, that these changes are offical and not just a joke from ringsdb. Anyhow, not all cards which are different to mine are marked as errata'ed. Is there a reliable source of player cards which have been modified?
