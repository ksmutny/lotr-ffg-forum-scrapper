Hey all,

 

Now that ringsdb exists and we can build decks with all the fun social features of netrunnerdb and thronesdb, I've started a weekly series of deck tech posts.

 

The first one is a single core secrecy deck built around the Sam and Galadriel combo: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/150/deck-tech-sam-gamgee-elf-friend-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/150/deck-tech-sam-gamgee-elf-friend-1.0]

 

And today's post is an Eowyn deck that stacks up card draw and attachments on her so she can quest and fight like mad: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/346/deck-tech-eowyn-her-eyes-grey-as-the-sea-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/346/deck-tech-eowyn-her-eyes-grey-as-the-sea-1.0]

 

I'm not sure yet what's coming up next week, but once it's up, I'll share it here!

For anyone who just thinks these are just links to deck lists, note that the deck lists essentially have an entire article attached describing the decks and some game recaps as well, so they seem pretty nice.

I'm curious about the term "tech", though. Never heard that word in a card game context before.

It's definitely possible that it's a weird term only my friends use when talking about deck builds and strategies.

 

And this week's deck is an all tactics stomp featuring Beorn for smashing and Hama for tricks: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/607/deck-tech-beorn-smash-2.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/607/deck-tech-beorn-smash-2.0]. In the list are recaps for Journey Along the Anduin (you can't talk about building a deck to kill the Hill Troll turn 1 and then not do it) and Into Ithilien, plus a short summary of a long series of failure against Shadow and Flame. Spoiler alert: the balrog is rough.

 

Coming up in the future (in no particular order unless I get requests) are a Faramir Outlands deck, a Dain-less dwarf swarm, and a deck focused on all of the location clearing attachments (like Ancient Mathom).

Looks fun. That Faramir Outlands deck also sounds interesting, though I don't need much imagination to guess the majority of the cards in the deck.

Yeah, Faramir Outlands is definitely not a surprising deck, though it has a few tricks that some people might not know about. Especially given how much the community seemed against Outlands when it first came out.

 

Plus sometimes I like to play strong decks that don't rely on any weird combo. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yea straight forward power decks are refreshing sometimes. I'm curious what tricks you have up your sleeve.

> It's definitely possible that it's a weird term only my friends use when talking about deck builds and strategies.

Back when I played Magic in college, about 15 years ago, it was quite a common term, so you're not the only ones!

Deck Tech number four is up: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/774/deck-tech-arrows-up-and-to-the-right-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/774/deck-tech-arrows-up-and-to-the-right-1.0], and it features a Gondor/Outlands deck up against a trio of Gondorian quests: The Steward's Fear, The Siege of Cair Andros, and Voyage Across Belegaer. 

 

I've also started a blog for these here: http://lotrdecktech.com [http://lotrdecktech.com], with RSS support here: http://www.lotrdecktech.com/feeds/posts/default [http://www.lotrdecktech.com/feeds/posts/default] if you want to follow that way.

I gave it a like just for the deck name.

Haha, thanks! I was tempted to add in Anborn so that when Faramir and Hirluin were exhausted all the arrows would be pointing down and to the right, but I thought that might be too much. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
