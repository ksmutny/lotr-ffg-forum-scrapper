does a player with grim resolve (an event that readies all characters in play) in hand could warn the others that they should quest with all their characters if they wished because he will be able to ready them all?

does this belong in discussing strategy or does it count as revealing a card in your hand, since, at least for now, there's only one card that readies all characters, and therefore against the secrecy rules?

what do you think?

 Well, as long as you don't name the card directly…

You can say "ok let's all go questing, trust me it's the best thing to do this round". With 5 resources available on your characters, the other players will probably understand what's going on. But it's not against the rules, and I play like that.

Obviously, when more cards will be available, other players won't be able to know exactly what you're planning but they should trust you anyway as you work together.

Considering that there are many things that could go wrong if all players quest with all of their characters (Dol Guldur Orcs, Necromancer's Reach, etc.) I don't see any problem revealing that you could ready them all. Also, don't forget you'll need sufficient resources - it's has a cost of five angel.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angel.gif]

yes, i meant if you already had the resources. just wanted to know your opinions since it's a bit subjective matter.

thanks for your input!
