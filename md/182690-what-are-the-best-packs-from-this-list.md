I'd go regular stuff before nightmare and gen con. Sagas, then VoI/Ringmaker, then the rest.

I strongly recommend the Road Darkens. Not only does it bring Gandalf hero, but the quests are rely nice and Journey in tthe Dark is one of my all-time favorites. It's a refreshing take on the Balrog. For player cards I would suggest Treason for Rohan themed decks and Entpower.

Overall I would suggest to buy normal stuff first and tthen Nightmare+PoD. I don't even own a lot of the Nightmare stuff..

Road Darkens is also my favorite box. Grab Treason of Saruman along with it. Only buy Nightmare if you (like Glaurung) feel like quests are too easy.

That's a hard question.

 

If you'r looking the best scenario i would say that the whole against the shadow cycle would be a great choice. There are most of my favourite scenarios like the Morgul Vale, Into Ithilien, siege of Cair Andros and the blood of Gondor. Other's are good as well but those are the best from that cycle.

 

There are also some good cards like ultimate defender Beregond.
