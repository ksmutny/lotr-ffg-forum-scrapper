Is the questlog gone? I have been checking for months and the Dreamchaser cycle is just not added. And now for over a month it throws an error.

Is it gone forever or is a major rehaul scheduled? Woud love the second option.

I don't think any of us know any more than you, unfortunately.

Personally, I've been hoping that the communityÂ would step up with a third-party solution, but I haven't heard anything from anyone lately. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Bizarrely, I can still access it on my Vista machine, but not on my Windows 7 machine or Android phone. (All on Firefox, I haven't tried other browsers).
