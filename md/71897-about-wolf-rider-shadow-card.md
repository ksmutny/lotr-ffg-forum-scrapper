 If its killed by the player, shall we return it to the top of the encounter card or just discard it?

Why would you return it back to the encounter deck?

The card says:

Wolf Rider
Type: Enemy
Encounter Set: Wilderlands
Threat Threashold: 10
Threat Strength: 1 Attack: 2 Defense: 0 Hit Points: 2
Goblin. Orc.
Surge.
Shadow: Wolf Rider attacks the defending player. That player may declare 1 character as a defender. Deal Wolf Rider its own Shadow card. After combat, return Wolf Rider to the top of the encounter deck.

 

So if it is still alive after combat, then it has to be placed in the encounter deck. 

 

@ Cutievalkyrie: I understand this shadow effect as you cannot attack him, after his attack you put him imediatly on the encounter deck. But I can be wrong in my interpretation (how easy could have been some Journey's down the Anduin)

I played this wrong the whole time. My life is a lie!

I am not sure this is correct. The FAQ says that "After combat" means "At the end of the combat phase". I read that therefore a full combat phase had to be resolved, with Shadow card dealt, Enemy attack resolution followed by Player attack resolution, is able/willing. Thus it was possible to destroy the Wolf before it is returned on the encounter deck. I tried to find an official ruling, but I think this is based on the FAQ and the rewording of "After combat".

 You are correct. After re-read the FAQ (pag.7) I realize that my interpretation isn't correct.

 

You can attack him, because as he was delt as a shadow card and shadow cards are only discarded at the end of combat phase, the shadow effect of Wolf Rider triggers imediatly to attack and the part that refers to putting him on top of the encounter card is only "triggered" when you discard the shadow cards.
