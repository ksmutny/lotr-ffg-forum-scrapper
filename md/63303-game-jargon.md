What is a 'Pippin' player?

a player that gets the most enjoyment out of the game by playing about with different combos

a bilbo is theme

boromir is winning

they hark back to last year when the desinger nate french used the terms in an article- however i believe the idea has been used before

It stems from Mark Rosewater’s division of Magic players between Timmys (who play experientially), Johnnys (who play creatively) and Spikes (who play competitively).

 I guess I'm more of a Boromir player, but with a dash of Pippin since I like to try new cards every once in a while. However, the basis of my decks remains pretty much geared towards winning, even if it excludes nice thematic cards.
