1.  Do they return back to the staging area?

2. If one of his heros revived? Does is that hero still keeping the resources he has when his killed?

What if he wills his cards to the other player? I mean, we are talking about dead PLAYERS gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] . That's some hardcore gaming.

1.  And what if the dead players heroes revived? Does he keep his hands when his killed?

2. Does weapon card exhaust when attacking?

1. As Mumekan said above, once a player is eliminated (either all of his heroes are dead, or his threat level reaches 50), you cannot interact with his cards, that is, his heroes cannot be revived.

2. no
