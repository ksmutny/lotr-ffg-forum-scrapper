In the announcement for Across the Ettenmoors they promised us more Mounts, so I wanted to know your speculations about what mount or mount related card we would get. My guess is that we will get Leadership Hasufel, which is fairly possible when you consider unique mounts so far have the sphere of one incarnation of the hero it belongs to in the story. I guess he could also be Lore or Tactics, but 1: Leadership is the only sphere to lack a unique mount and 2: Core Aragorn is still a prominent hero and the most representative of him as a whole, IMO. 

 

On the other hand, we could get a mount related event kinda like Ent-moot or The Eagles are Coming, but I think it's just less likely than an actual new mount.

We already have an ally that searches for mounts. I'm personally hoping for a mount that gives ranged only because it makes sense. I mean, why wouldn't I be able to charge across the board to rescue my friend?

I'd like to see Eowyn's horse I think.

There's also Stybba, which I think was Merry's pony.

Sphere: tactics

Cost: 2

Trait: mount

Text: each hero with a mount gets +1wp

If attached hero is aragorn, he gains tactics sphere

Well, we can safely say this mount won't be in the lore sphere, as we will be getting none return & wellinghal custodian.

Leadership will be getting the dunedain message event & tactics will get their side quest: delay the enemy.

So that leaves room for 1 card more each.

It's not neutral, as we'll be getting the hope rekindled event.

I think we know nothing about the two spirit cards, so the savest bet would be another spirt mount, as most mount support is in spirit.

 

edit: oh wait, wasn't there a spoiled noldor event card for spirit in this pack? it was pretty good i remember.

Although I don't think this will happen, it's possible we could be getting a different Asfaloth.

We did just get Hobbit Pony, are you sure that's not what they were referring to?

Yeah, Fair and Perilous is supposed to be in the Ettenmoors. That and Wellinghall Custodian will boost my Ent and Noldor decks immensely.
