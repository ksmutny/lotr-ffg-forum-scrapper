Hi there,

I played against this scenario today and had several questions about it:

- What happens if by placing tokens with Northern Tracker you have already removed Caradhras from the staging area once you get to the quest phase that makes it the current location? Does it come back again?

- What happens if you beat it again? Will you gain twice the victory points (once from Northern Tracker and once for defeating it the normal way)?

- Discarded characters (due to being at 0 or less Willpower) are considered dead when calculating the final score or not?

Thanks!

Javier

Yes, it is officially ruled that it will become the active location even if it is in the Victory Pile.  I think this entry is in the FAQ.

No, you just get the VP in your Victory Pile as is.  If it is removed from the Victory Pile, you don't get the VP.  It has no "memory" of the card which is removed.

Discarded Heroes are considered dead in final score calculation, allies are irrelevant.
