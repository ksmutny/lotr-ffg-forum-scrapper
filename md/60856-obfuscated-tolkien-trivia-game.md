# [Obfuscated Tolkien Trivia Game](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60856-obfuscated-tolkien-trivia-game/)

seeing as there is some interest we may as well give this a go

so, the answer is hidden in an obfuscated clue, where you replace the answer with alternate words that mean the same thing

i.e. clue- 'satchel termination' answer=Bag End

RULES- keep to the main trilogy, silmarillion and hobbit, and the one who answers right goes next

I like the idea, rich. May be a bit difficult since the names of many places and personalities in Middle-earth are in fictional languages (try coming up with something for Dwarrowdelf). Still, I think it might be fun!

Here are some I thought up:

Blood Sack (1 word)

Fastener Fruit Conveyance  (2 words)

Additional Entryway (1 word)

yes perhaps just a tolkien trivia game with a riddle type clue may be better.....leaves more options open

also those are good, im busy trying to figure them out- are we sticking with things that have been released and included in the game, or is this open ended?

Gorbag and Buckleberry Ferry are correct!

Andor is on the right track, but not quite the answer...

A couple more:

Shank o' Girl (1 word)

Fee Staff (1 word--this one might be pretty hard, but it's a major character)

## 8 [richsabre on February 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60856-obfuscated-tolkien-trivia-game/?do=findComment&comment=597978)

very good, seeing as this has sort of taken off, ive turned it into the actual game thread. winner of the clue goes next with the next clue ie. so if i get these right ill go next and so on

FEE STAFF= BIL BO

SHANK O' GIRL= LEG O LAS

great clues by the way!

Even this not being competitive, you owned.

This is a bit of a long shot but is the answer Orrostar? (The easternmost province of Numenor)  Either way= Orro (OR)   , Jesus = Star.

Yehhhhhhhh!!! Well done rich. Hey, that sounds good - a Tom Bombadil piece. If its personal no worries but it would be great to see your views on that part of LOTR. There are a few chapters that stand out as being "eyebrow raising" and thats one of them. I cant help thinking there is an alternative meaning to that little episodebut im buggered if ive worked it out yet!!

thanks and youre gonna love it (hopefully!) its all about the mysteries and loose ends of middle earth so you have

-bombadil- who and what was he and what is his purpose in the narrative (there is one certain quote from the return of the king im still figuring out its true meaning)

-radagast-what happened to him and did he technically fail in his istari task

-balrogs-wings or no

-and im still writing the last parts- either based on the blue wizards, how old was the mouth of sauron, what was sarumans ring and what was its powers or what happened to the entwives

 admitedly theyve all been tackled before but im trying to put my own spin on it

ok the clue

 

ARE WE FINISHED? HINT!-- you need to add the ? to the answer for it to make sense
