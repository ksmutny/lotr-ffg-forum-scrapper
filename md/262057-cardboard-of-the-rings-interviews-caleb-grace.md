I Agree!

There is value in guaranteeing that a certain type of card is not pulled from the surge keyword. Over the course of a game there is often one card type that you cannot tolerate dealing with. Maybe you're on the verge of location lock, maybe you're strapped for defenders. But, maybe there is one specific card that you know will end the game. There is value in reducing that probability to zero.

But, does anyone do this? I'm armchair quarterbacking on this one. I don't usually play with the lampwright that often.

It's being reported on BGG that Caleb said on this show that there was going to be a "big announcement" this week.

That report is indeed correct. He also confirmed that for the last year he worked on LOTR stuff which haven't been released yet.

I hadn't tried him until recently thinking that he would be a fail too often.  But when I did try him - against a quest I knew well - he was great.  He is a control card, and as with all control decks you need to know your opponent.  If you are playing against a quest blind he will not be as effective.  One of the worst things that can happen in a quest is cascading surge, and he is great at stopping that because often the surge only comes from one card type and you can metagame that.  In other words, you can make your odds of success much greater than 1 in 3.

I ran him in my Palantir support deck to guarantee his cancels.

Unfortunately, we've received word that this announcement has been delayed until early December.

Thanks for telling us! Saves us the disappointment when Friday rolls around uneventfully.

Should we take bets on whether we see the announcement or the next AP first?

Gotta love the merger...

I think it would be great if it had the Rohan trait. With the ability to recur it through Gamling and set off a bunch of response triggers when discarded... It could have been a nice tool for the Rohan discard deck.
