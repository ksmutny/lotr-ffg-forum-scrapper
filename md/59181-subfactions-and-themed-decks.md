I just fininished Carrock, am moving onto rosegobel, and have the next two packs in the mail gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

I managed to beat the carrock solo using a mostly Rohan themed deck. I went to play it solo again, this time trying to focus on an eagles theme, and was promptly devoured by trolls. I'm sure its half build, but it seems that there just wasn't enough support options (as of C@TC) to do such a heavily themed deck. I'm curious, with the later expansions, how possible is it to play themed decks? I notice quite a few "subfactions"... dwarves, gondor, nobel, king, etc. I know Kazad dum gives dwarves some lovin', but I heard despite all of the new cards, dwarf decks just aren't really possible yet.

How are the other subfactions doing? Are any of them really feasable? I can vouch for roherum, at least with my small amount of experience and luck, seem to be a decent build (if not just for solo games).

Also, do you think we'll get more istari? The game seems to have picked a timeline, so I don't suppose we can ever hope to get a good sauruman the white (unfortunate, i'd like to see a pre-fallen version of him).

well as for istari, saruman would be an interesting character- in this timeline he had already been devoured, and the two blue wizards were never in the west of middle earth so it would be pushing it to include them

as for themes even with everything out to date its still pretty hard to get a workable deck for every quest

quest heavy quests becoming unbelievably easy with the later rohan cards included in emyn muil onwards

dwarves with khazad dum are still lacking in certain areas

all the rest dont really have enough cards out at the moment

i guess were seeing elves in the next cycle as well as more dwarves so this is basically something weve got to wait for

Eagles are a very solid theme.  They don't make a good solo deck, but one player running eagles in a two-player game will work quite well.

And Frodo never left the Shire, so I'm not entirely sure that the timeline counts much anymore.

well there is a limit on how much they should change it, i mean having saruman completely good would be like having gollum as smeagol....if time doesnt matter then we might as well have thorin in play, or gil galad

frodo hadnt left the shire but they have to leave at some point....doing this doesnt change frodo as a character, but having an uncorrupted saruman does, he should at least be 75/25 bad/good- there as some lines the devs shouldnt cross
