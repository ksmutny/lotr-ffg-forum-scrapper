I was thinking...about..erm ...thinking, today. And I thought, well, how much time do I actually spend thinking about my moves in this game...

 

And my answer is - not a lot ...at all. infact I can fly through a game in about 10 minutes. Which is bad, because they aren't designed for that, not even solo I think

 

I remember I said something like this once on the forum before...I need to slow down.....right down, and enjoy the game more. Take in the atmosphere as it were haha

 

But also, it probably is the reason why I lose so much :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

So tell me, do you think you spend enough time thinking about your choices, options and strategies in this game?

I think. A lot. One of the last games that me and my friends played, it was extremely hard for us. The final stage of the first VoI quest, a lot of enemies and more to come if we don't finish leftovers this turn... 

 

It was a real puzzle. We literally broke our brains trying to figure out how to do everything to finish everyone off before the next quest phase. And we did. The thought process and discussion took around 30 minutes.

yes, this is what I miss most in solo play - the discussions of strategy making...when I talk to myself it never seems to go anywhere :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

but when I have played 2-3 player, I remember that the table talk was one of the things I found most enjoyable about it

Rich, Welcome back!

You probably missed this thread, but I ran a tournament that kind of looked at your question. If you follow the link you can read how 20 players playing the same decks and encounter decks where cards were ordered in the same way. It's called a duplicate game.

http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/101785-lotr-lcg-duplicate-tournament-solo/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/101785-lotr-lcg-duplicate-tournament-solo/]

Amazingly, each player had a different outcome based on how they "thought" about the state of the game and the chocies they were confronted with. Of course this is not the same exact question as yours, since I was interested to see if we all think the same way when confronted with the same challenge. This turned out not to be the case, and reading some of the game plays really hilights how different players with various playstyls think when playing. Although, players chocies early on influence how the encounter deck plays out later, so decks would get out of sync after a round or 2, but it was usually based on a choice the player made.

Better yet, if your up for it, read through my intro and play the game, and compare your game to the other players. It may shed some light on how you think while playing.

Most of the time there isn't that much to think about. I stop to think whenever it seems necessary I suppose.

Most of the situations in the game are more about making a probability judgement than being able to actually find a solution. (The best use of resources in the planning phase for instance).

I've found that bigger games tend to have more moments where you need to stop and think (who should take this enemy, who can handle that enemy). In solo I'm not sure I would stop to think much at all - just make the play that seemed best and move on straight away.

I play mostly solo and usually I just fly through the games. Lately though, I've been taking my time reading and admiring the art on all the cards In order to get a more thematic game.

Tracker1: wow! what a cool idea, im  disappointed I missed that , but I will surely look through the thread and read into...sounds cool :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Rapier: yeah I agree...it is often clear what is the best move...though I still think im missing much of the game by going so fast..though perhaps that is more for theme reasons than strategy reasons

On the occasion that I play solo I don't think a lot about the cards I play.

Mostly it is quite easy to choose the best card to play or to withhold resources.

I do however keep an eye on the encounter deck and think about what's in it and might pop up.

This gets more important as the game progresses as the chances of that nasty treachery coming increase.

Yet I play multi-player usually, and the table talk discussion about our course of action is the most enjoyable part of the game.

These can take anywhere from 1 minute to 20 more or less, depending on the amount of cards on the table. And the amount of alcohol ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

My experience is that when I play with my partner, the game takes more than twice the time. And even on my own -- often playing 2-hand coop -- I am not always too rushed; but when I am, the game suffers, I make more tactical mistakes and do not enjoy the atmosphere so well, just as you noted Rich.

Wow. So many answers so quick.

Anyway, I always try to think but the outcome is rarely as I think. Often because I'm unlucky or because I overlook a thing and don't see it before it's too late :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

But in general I think I actually use more time buying, sorting, deck building and preparing than actually playing the game o_O

yes! I feel like that sometimes, I make decks more than I play them..though that is sometimes just as enjoyable :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

We usually devote some time to think about the situation and what should be the best thing to do. On the other hand, we try not to overcomplicate it just for the sake of it.

yes lotr ia really different game experience wi5h different numbers of players. but is really cool! deck building in lotr is also very different really depend on players number. And this is really strong point of the game!!! I have only couple of players around me so I lucky if we can play by 3 sometimes!

Yes, in general the deck-building is the main asset for me as well. Of course it would be pointless without the actual gaming but I certainly devote much more time to building decks than playing them.

## 17 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106324-time-to-think/?do=findComment&comment=1085831)

For me, most satisfaction comes when you build the deck or combination of decks (my friends are casuals so I always have to build decks for them if we're going to play) and then they actually work.

I like to build my deck at the same time wiith the other friends' decks. In adittion, player decks for special quests! The end result is the winning sure, and winning with higscore. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
