"When Revealed: Each location in the staging area gets +1 Threat Strength until the end of the phase. Then, each player with a threat of 35 or higher chooses and discards 1 card from his hand.Â " what happens if the player withe 35+ threat does not have any card in his hand?

If it is not possible to resolve an effect, you just ignore it.
