Sorry if this is a double post. I am looking for other people to play on lackeyCCG. I am on around 7:30 pm Pacific Time (Los Angeles). Thanks. Hope to see others there. Please feel free to post what times you are in lackeyCCG, so we can all find people to play with.

I am on East Coast time. I typically am not free until around 8:00pm (EST).
