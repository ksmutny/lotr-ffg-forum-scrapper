# [Power in the Earth = Useless card?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94958-power-in-the-earth-useless-card/)

Question 1: Has anyone out there chosen to use Power In The Earth in a deck?  Any sleeper combos or synergies I haven't thought of?

(I'm not talking about using it to fill out a Core-only deck) 

 

Question 2: Should errata be used to prevent cards from becoming completely useless and unplayed?

 

If I could fix it, I'd probably make one of the following adjustments:

 * Zero cost
 * -2 threat to target location
 * add "Draw a card" after the effect
 * add "Pay 1 (Spirit) resource to take this card from your discard pile and put it in your hand"

I consider it pretty useless too, if you have other cards from the cycles and expansions available. Secret Paths (which is an Event) can make a greater difference, I think.

 

As for question two, well... yes, why not? If errata make sure that cards are not over-powered, they should be able to make mediocre cards more playable as well. But I would probably want all 4 features you mention added to even consider putting Power in the Earth in a deck. There are too many other good Lore cards out there.

Yes, quite useless!  Heck, even the artwork is disappointing.

i think the artwork is beautiful and i can also think of a use for it. if you want locations in the staging area (for some quest related reason) but not its threat, then you can attatch this card. perfect!

Of course you're right about the function of the card.  I'm just not sure there is ever an incentive to use it over other cards.  I can't imagine ever using a slot in my deck for that card.  The only case I can think of is if you've just got the Core Set and you don't have much choice.

It should have been a tactics card. Text: "As long as Power in the Earth is attached to a location in the staging area, each hero gets plus 1 WP".

We can open a post about the useless cards, and discuss about if they are really useless or not. There are several

Probably one of the few cards that I would confidently hit with the dreaded "unplayable" tag. Not a bad idea for a card, just way too underpowered

Regarding a location you want to keep in the staging area:

Better to neutralized the location rather than dealing with the cost of 12 quest points.

 

However, that said, I pretty much agree that Power in the Earth is useless at present.

Seeing that we have to look through the quest decks to find a possible situation where it can be useful, speaks for itself.
