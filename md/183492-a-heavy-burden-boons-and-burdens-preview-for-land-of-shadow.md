It's kind of disappointing that there are only two burdens and one boon in the whole box.

Oh man are you serious? I haven't actually read the article yet just got to work... thats severely disappointing.. boons and burdens are one of my favourite parts of saga/campaign play...

Yeah, it's a bit disappointing but at least the cards are pretty cool.

I think now the main question is when is this coming out? They've pretty much ran out of articles for this expansion. Hopefully this will be at Gencon and released not long after.

Yeah, when I read the part saying there are twice as many burdens as boons, I didn't expect that to mean 2 and 1.

I'm seriously wondering now if this is the surprise we are supposed to get at GenCon.  My brain says now way but this is a lot of spoiler in a short period of time.

Hmmmmmmmm is it just me or does it seem like after you have earned it Brace of Coneys can be used once per game for the rest of the campaign? If this is the case this could potentially be one of the most powerful boons in the campaign thus far.

You could use it first turn for an extra two cards for one player and an extra two resources for the other (two handed) in pretty much every game so long as the player with it in hand has the ring bearer. Even second turn it is incredibly strong. 

For solo play it is even more bonkers, you will be able to play it first turn no matter what as you will always control the ring bearer and you will obviously choose yourself as the target for both effects. You could even make a hero lineup that normally does not put you in secrecy and then use Brace of Coneys at the start of every game to put yourself INTO secrecy. 

 

Other boons we have had so far have had similar powerful effects but are removed from the campaign pool afterwards. The fact we can use this boon time and time again (I guess when you think about it there are only 6 quests left after this box though, plus any POD quests we get that can be added to saga mode) is a pretty big deal. 

It is kind of bugging me that the potentially best boon card we have seen thus far is a couple of dead rabbits  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

You probably have to shuffle it into your deck, making it much less consistent.

ah of course! I had not thought of that at all and just assumed it would be added to the first players hand. Very good point!

They've only shown those 3, doesn't mean that's all there is. The article states:

 

> ...The Land of Shadow includes twice as many different burdens as boons.

 

I'm guessing this means twice as many as the Treason of Saruman, so that's a  total of 12 by my count.

"That’s why one of the two burdens in the box is called A Heavy Burden (The Land of Shadow, 52)."

"That act of generosity inspired the single boon card for this box: Brace of Coneys (The Land of Shadow, 14)."

I stand corrected (and totally misread the article). That's what happens when I read stuff before my morning cup of tea ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
