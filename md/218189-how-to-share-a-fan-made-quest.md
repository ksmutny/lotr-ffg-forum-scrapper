Some time ago I took my own aproach to design my own quest(s). Recently I found those files on my hard drive. I made some improvements (e.g. adding some side quests) to them and now I am thinking to share them. Anyone interested? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I printed them (normal paper) and sleeved them to play, but probably not every one wants to put so much effort into this. What would be the best way to publish the cards? I am thinking of Octgn or something like that, but I have absolutely no experience with that - I don't use any software to play.

OCTGN sets are definitely the most accessible. When I completed my Shadows Over Gondor expansion, that's the format everyone wanted.

Here's how you make an expansion for it: http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/developer-guide/ [http://octgngames.com/lotrlcg/developer-guide/]

If you got a link to the pdf's I would love to share the quest on the facebook page my little podcast. OCTGN format would currently get a lot more attention just for simplicity sake for players.

I am a bit disapointed, creating a set for OCTGN is complicated. As I use Strange Eons to build my cards I'd expect some sort of automated routine ;-) Well, lets see whenever I find time for build up my missions.

 

And for the pdf; I will create one and send you a message. I'd like the thought of sharing my quests. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

OCTGN set creation is pain, but it pays off in the end, believe me.

I suggest doing the OCTGN scenario, then submitting it to Tales from the Cards. Ian loves new material.
