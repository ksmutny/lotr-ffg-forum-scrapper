I know I spell it wrong. That's because I'm too lazy to remember her actual name, and Nyashish is first thing that comes to my mind when I try to remember it. And I know she's that corsair gal from the previous, that's why I'm so stoked about her. Also, extremely terrified of what her text box might bear, because 1/2/2/4 hero, even with 1 threat discout, must have a REALLY good text box to be viable. And I want her to be viable with all my heart.

I find Na'asiyah much more intuitive and easy to spell than Nyashish, personally. Calling her Nyashish seems very whimsy, much like how someone "else" used to say Leadersh*t.

 

And yeah, I agree she'll have to have a hell of a textbox in order to be good, and I'm pretty sure she will.

Dunedain Remedy is crazy useful in the right line up or really.... any line up with Elrond!

2 points of healing for nothing and then 2 points of healing for a resource any time you desire after that is pretty **** good. The fact it always sticks around as well and provides well costed healing for essentially the rest of the game (unless discarded by an encounter effect) makes it even more useful. 

 

Late game when you have damage across multiple heroes you can heal it all with this single card if you have the resources to do so.

i completely agree with you, but i also find it funny that Lore Glorfindel has a very similar ability but is almost universally considered completely useless (and yes, i get the ways in which Dunedain Remedy is better; it's still funny to me)

Maybe she will stick with her enemy/ally ability theme and you spend resources to boost her?

As a reminder:

 

Action: While Na'asiyah is attacking or defending, spend 1 resource from her to give her +2 Attack or +2 Defense for this attack. Action: Spend 1 resource from a hero you control to place 1 resource on Na'asiyah. (Limit once per round).

 

So if hero version had the same power, you'd have a weakened version of Bifur's ability, plus the ability to jump to 4+ attack or 4+ defense for 1 resource.  Seems viable.

weakened version of Bifur's ability? Wouldn't it work the same way?

Her ability needs a resource from a hero you control, while any player can trigger Bifur's ability.

It would be "boring" only in the fact that we've seen it before, but I think it would be awesome to play with as a consistent hero.

I have a feeling the ability will be at least slightly different. If it was a copy of her Objective Ally version you could give her Steward of Gondor and have her attack or defend for 7 every round just using her own resources.

## 29 [Gizlivadi on August 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228777-drowned-ruins-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2393762)

So far objective versions have been different from their ally/hero versions, so I think it's safe to assume she'll be different, which is great because if she was the same it would be very boring. I still think objective Na'asiyah is one of the best objective allies we've had so far.

## 30 [dalestephenson on August 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228777-drowned-ruins-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2393764)

> I have a feeling the ability will be at least slightly different. If it was a copy of her Objective Ally version you could give her Steward of Gondor and have her attack or defend for 7 every round just using her own resources.

She'd defend/attack for 8 if she were using her own resources (+2 buff three times, base attack/defense of 2).  But it'd use all her resources, so Steward of Gondor with Blood of Numenor or Gondorian Fire would be much more efficient, and also work for multiple defense/attacks with readying.  So as said above, a weaker version of BoN/GF.

## 31 [Slothgodfather on August 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228777-drowned-ruins-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2393785)

I'm fine with taking a different approach, but my money is on it being some type of resource cost for boosted stats. 

 

However, she currently is 8 threat for 9 stats so I'm not sure how strong they will make her ability.  Likely only +1 per resource, or it costs two at a time to get +2.    Now I'm curious what other heroes have disparities in their threat/stat ratio, so here they are:

 

 

Looking through the other heroes, we have these heroes with a positive threat/stat ratio:

Beorn: 12 to 16 - strong ability & stats with serious limitations

Bifur: 7 to 8 - no actual downside, solid ability for resource smoothing

Eowyn (T): 6 to 9 - yes, I count her as 6 threat.

Glorfindel (S): 5 for 12: OP!

Mirlond: 7 to 8

 

 

Look at heroes with the opposite ratio:

Beregond: 10 to 9 - fantastic abilities

Bilbo Baggins: 9 to 6 - considered a pretty terrible choice for card draw...

Elladan & Elrohir: 10 to 9, but with each other they are 10 to 12.

Elrond: 13 to 12 - OP

Galadriel: 9 to 8 - OP

Grima: 9 to 8

Hirluin the Fair: 8 for 7 - still OP

 

 

Of the positive ratio heroes, only Bifur and Mirlond seem to be the most comparable.  They are both off by 1 and have no negative effects.  Both fit into completely different decks so they aren't really directly comparable but I figure with such low starting threat her ability is not going to be excessively strong.   Perhaps it is limit 1 per round and costs 2 resources to get the boosted stats.  So without outside resource acceleration, she can't use it each turn.  

 

I also decided, after looking through all the heroes again, that the reason we have so many 2/2/2 stat heroes is not to give us versatile heroes, but to simply keep the average hero threat closer to 10.  The versatility is just a "perk" of this strategy.  

 

 

what about a hero with a timed counter?

There aren't many objective allies who became heroes after.  Arwen, Faramir, Amarthiul, and Grima.  Amarthiul didn't have a useful ability in objective ally form.  Arwen gives a resource when she exhausts, a cross between her ally version (buffs a defender when exhausts) and hero version (generates a resource, though with more restrictions).  Faramir's ability was tied to the scenario (though his objective statline of 2/3/1/4 would've made his hero versions more popular).  Grima exhausts to draw a card, so a strictly inferior ability to Beravor.

 

I don't think the same ability would be "boring", because having it on an objective ally for a scenario or two isn't at all like having it available for every quest on a hero.  With that said, I'm not at all convinced that the hero version would have the same wording as the objective ally, even if she used the same general concept.

It's funny how everything from her enemy side is similar to her hero version, even engagement cost transfers into the threat cost.

Is there a spoiler I missed?

 

As a reminder, this is the enemy side, which without resource acceleration would be pretty bad in a hero, though quite powerful if it were an action instead:

 

Forced: When Na’asiyah attacks or defends, she gets +1 Attack and +1 Defense for this attack for each resource on her. After this attack, discard 1 resource from her.

Actually, since it only discards on the attack, it'd make her a very powerful defender -- a built-in Blood of Numenor that can be activated for free.

Sometimes I get behind on my forum reading and I'll come back to 90+ new posts.  So I'll look through a few choice threads and then hit "Mark all as read".   

 

I hope she still keeps one of her pirate traits at least.  In about a year we should see the emergence of a Corsair/Raider deck!

I really like the player cards in this pack. I am partial to Silvan and staging area attack decks but I still think it's a very strong pack. Dunedain Remedy really rounds out some weaknesses of Dunedain decks and gives healing to Leadership for the first time! Interrogation is also a card that feels like, "why didn't we have this before?" and helps Trap decks be more well rounded. Good stuff.

Looking at the partially revealed traits, I'm pretty sure one of them is "Corsario" (Corsair) and the other is "Guerrero" (Warrior). So at least she'll be able to wear the Raiment of War from the get-go.

I'm neither blind nor forgetful, but "everything from her enemy side" would include the *ability* the enemy version has, and the spoiler picture doesn't show the ability.  Only threat, stats, and partial keywords are visible, and since we'd been speculating about the ability, the enemy version's slightly different ability seemed relevant.

Elf-stone has to attach to the active location, so it'd only work if you swapped the location out after attaching it, then travelled to it again.

So, out of the entire thread you read just one post? Because almost every other my post in this thread is the evidence that I don't know her text box. And, when I said "everything" in that one post of mine you bothered to read, I implied "everything we possess knowledge about", because, you know, I wondered what her text box might be this entire thread.

So, out of the entire thread you just read the first line of only one of my posts?  I had posted four times in the thread before the message you quoted, including the post *right before yours*, and was focusing on the speculation that her ability would be the same or similar to her *ally version*, as were other posts.  It was completely impossible that I had not seen the spoiler, given that I had already commented on it four times.  Your post mentioned the *enemy version*, which previously had not been mentioned.  I hadn't considered the possibility that her ability would be based on her enemy ability before, and the part of my post you didn't quote focused on that, as did the post immediately following.

 

The spoiler question was in hopes that your "identical to the enemy version" meant you'd read her actual ability somewhere, rather than just commenting on the threat.  Since the original spoiler is foreign, and you aren't native, I had a brief thrill of hope you had inside information.  Alas, it was not to be.

How it has anything to do with your previous posts? It's you the one who commented my one of my posts out of the context and made the wrong assumption based on only it's contents. Regardless, it ultimately doesn't matter, I would prefer for this thread to stop being derailed.

No talk about the quest itself, eh?

Those are some tough Underwater locations! Better be ready to quest hard before choosing to dive... I like that the quest puts the decision in your hands, though, when to go underwater.

There's an eel, a crab and mention of undead enemies.

The enemies are not so bad in the quest. Yup, the undead make another appearance, but the new Underwater enemies aren't anything terrible for a modern quest. It's really the location decisions that make the quest of interest, methinks. Not a particularly tough one if you're prepared to quest, but very thematic, also as per usual for them lately.

Yeah, I actually managed a Caldara win without ever traveling to an Underwater location! The archetype is bonkers.

How did you manage that? Th quest condition is : You cannot advance unless there are at least 3 Underwater locations in the victory display. ?

There's a Treachery in the deck that adds a Grotto location Underwater-side up. When you also consider that none of them are immune to player effects, you can Mariner's Compass/Rhovanion Outrider/Mirkwood Explorer/Asfaloth/The Evening Star said Underwater location without ever travelling to it.

received my copy yesterday, tried it for the first time this evening. I always play a quest blind the first time, so i had no idea what to expect....playing an attachment-heavy deck. First turn i travel to a grotto, flip it and its the "all your attachments have no text except traits" one, with 10 quest points. Got a bit of a pounding early on, stabilised...then couldn't progress enough before threating out. Ouch. I think i need to tweak my deck a bit for the scenario before trying again.

Don't forget that you can't play Attachments or Allies while the active is an Underwater location.
