# [Silvan Tracker healage](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59091-silvan-tracker-healage/)

The card reads:

Response: After a Silvan character readies during the refresh phase, heal 1 damage from that character

 

Im unsure about how this is supposed to be read. Is A character only meant to be read as 1 single character per copy of the Silvan Tracker or is it meant to include that all eligible silvan characters can heal 1 wound based on the presence of a single Silvan Tracker?

Any and all inputs are welcome

it means that when any card readies during the refresh phase with the Silvan trait it heals. The problem of course is at this time there is very few Silvan cards that have more than 1 hit point, so it is mostly usless. I havn't really seeen a way to expoit this effect really well yet

Well the cards Haldir, Mirkwood Runner, Legolas and Silvan Tracker itself are examples of Silvans with more than 1 hp. Don´t know if there are any more but I´d still say that´s a pretty decent start to base a silvan heal ability

exactly.. a start but not a real tribe yet... after some more player cards it will be a thing but for now I do not think it is really working. Reminds me of when eagels started coming out... people wanted to run a eagle deck.. but it just wasn't a "thing" yet

Yeah, Silvan Tracker is still somewhat of a "promise card," in that it hints at a future deck archetype without being particularly useful right now. Still, its healing ability makes it a solid defender by itself, and two Silvan Trackers in play can essentially soak up an unlimited number of attacks from enemies with 3 attack or less. Decent card, and likely to become pretty darn good in the near future.

you know types of elves always used to confuse me so i read up on them and discovered that legolas, despite coming from mirkwood a silvan area, was actually sindarin.....and i noticed FFG put him as silvan, i wonder if this was intentionally on their behalf or not
