I had initiated combat with Great cave_Troll. it has the text "No attachments can be played on Great Cave_troll. now I am not sure what that means. I have never seen a card that attaches to an enemy, so I assumed that any attachments my heros had dont work when attacking the Great Cave_troll. Could someone fill me in what to do with the card text. Gimli had one copy of Citadel Plate on with 6 damage so I could attack the Great cave troll with little dificulty with another ally or two, but I am not sure what to make of this cards text.

What it means is that you can't play cards like "Forest Snare" on him.  Right, now that's the only card that is attached to enemies, other than Ranger Spikes.  The attachments on your heroes aren't effected at all by the Great Cave-Troll.

So, the Great Cave-troll can go into Ranger Spikes but not into a Fores Snare?

I don't think so since the Cave-troll is not an "eligible" enemy for this attachment.

One clarification first: there are two Great Cave-trolls.  The original question in this thread was about the one from the Khazad-dum expansion, which states "No attachments can be played on Great Cave-troll."

 

There is another Great Cave-troll in The Road Darkens expansion, and his text reads "Cannot have attachments."

 

The first troll is eligible for Ranger Spikes, I think, but the second is not.

 

There is a ruling in a thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/79258-trolls-and-ranger-spikes/?hl=%2Battachments+%2Btroll] that officially sanctions Ranger Spikes against enemies with "Players  cannot play attachments on..."  Putting a trap into the staging area is considered different from playing it on an enemy.  The Khazad-dum troll is a little different, as it says "no attachments can be played on" rather than "players cannot play attachments on..."  I think the important phrase, however, is "play on," and Ranger Spikes doesn't get "played on" the KD Great Cave-troll, it gets "played into" the staging area and "attached to" the troll later. So, legal.

Hm okay fine with me but you have to admit that Khazad-dum Cave-troll would also have as card text "Cannot have attachments" if ranger spike would have been released by that time. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] But well if you want him in that trap so be it.

You are technically correct Grandspleen.

 

THE BEST KIND OF CORRECT.
