Uks, i have just thought it: if you play a monosphere lore deck with Mirlonde..., and Mirlonde dies...do you increase your threat level by 3?

 

Another question: in DolGuldur she is the captured hero..., your start threat level is +3?

Her ability only effects your starting threat, which is set at the very beginning of the game. The only other time starting threat comes into play is if you trigger Lore Aragorn's once per game ability. In either case, this number is set at the start of the game and does not change for any reason.
