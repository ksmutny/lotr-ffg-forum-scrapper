If I choose not to defend against an enemy attack, I have to deal all damage to one of my Heroes (not Allies). The rules do not state a distinction between ready or exhausted Heroes taking the damage, so I suppose I am not under obligation to wound one of my still ready, undefending, Heroes (if any), preferring to hurt an exhausted yet sturdier Hero, so I can counterattack with the unopposing Hero/es. Or is a ready undefending Hero the only eligible for damage? I don't think so. Am I on the right track?
