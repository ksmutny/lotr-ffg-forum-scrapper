I have a copy of the game coming by mail within a week.  While I'm waiting, I'm considering options for after we play a few games with mono-color decks.

Does splashing Leadership into other decks work?  

I'd like to try: Gloin + Gimli + Thalin.  (Leadership splashed into a Tactics deck, for an all dwarves group)

Also: Theodred + Eowyn + Dunhere (Leadership splashed into a Spirit deck, for all Rohan group)

I'm also considering splashing Aragorn into a Lore deck.

Would any of these work? 

I know that there are cards that would become useless (Thicket of Spears and certain high-cost cards perhaps), but are there benefits to adding a leadership character to a deck based on another theme?  Sneak Attack + Gandalf looks like it will be pretty good.  Are there other reasons that adding a Leadership character to a deck could make it better?

I just have a hard time putting Legolas and Gimli into the same group during the 17 years before they met in Rivendell.  Elves and Dwarves didn't seem to be on the best terms.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Leadership is the best all around sphere and, in general, goes well with any of the others. It probably works best with spirit and lore, at the moment. Maybe not quite as well with tactics, but that's just a function of the limitations that tactics has. But as I said, generally it will mesh well with everything else.

ive got a leadership (aragorn) spirit (eowyn) and lore (beravor) and it works great so far, best deck ive built, with eowyn questing, aragorn fighting and beravor being a just good all rounder- it works for me

Right now splashing leadership is just about the only to build an effective dual-sphere deck, so yes, that works quite well. The 'All Rohan' deck is, in my opinion, the best solo deck buildable by the base set.

The easiest and mosto obvious combo so far is Leadership/Spirit.You can use all spirit cards with Aragorn and Celebrian's stone and with throne of Gondor and 3x unexpected courage(with 3 core sets) thos are  powrefull tools for solo.With Celebrian's stone you can even  use Aragorn to bring back dead heroes (fortune of fate) and with stand and fight and sneak attack Gandalf comes to save you 9 times.

I use 3 core sets and i enjoy so much this deck.I can't stop playgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

Servant:

Can't use Galdalf 9 times unfortunately. If you Sneak Attack him he goes back to your hand. If you put him into play the 'vanilla' way he is discarded from play, thus Stand and Fight does not work.

I think Spirit/Leadership is the best deck by far for Solo play now, but I'm not a fan of Aragorn in it due to the enormous amount of starting threat. I prefer Eowyn, Theodred and Dunhere, and have close to a 100% success rate against scenario's 1 and 2 with it. Theodred is fantastic in a 'Splashing Leadershi' deck due to his additional resource generation and low threat.

## 7 [FiendishDevil on May 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46566-splashing-leadership-into-other-decks/?do=findComment&comment=466299)

Leadership (purple) is just too good. I think purple can be splashed into any color. 3 copies of Steward of Gondor, Sneak Attack, and that one card that lets you draw 2 when an ally leaves play... Those 9 cards are almost a staple for me.

Am i doing something wrong mate?You can use Gandalf 3 times with sneak attack,then 3 times from your hand and  stand and fight brings an ally from your discard pile.I play 3x stand and fight so i have him 3 more times.Please if i play somethink wrong tell me cause i don't want to win unfairsad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

Nevermind, I re-read and was wrong myself. I thought Gandalf discarded himself from the game, but he actually just removes himself from play. You're all good.

You know she only works on Treachery, not When Revealeds from Enemy cards, right?

Yeap,treachery cards are those who harts my heroes cause my  deck's work is to quest all the time reduse threat and place progress tokens on the quest card as fast as it can.So wen reveald effects like the one on the Dol Guldur orcs is not a big deal cause you can place the wounds on any character and not only on your heroes.If i am so unlucky and i don't have allys Aragorn is there to help the fellowship.

What is usually worse is the Effect of the King Spider (?): Every player must exhaust one character. If you sent (almost) everyone to the quest, all players are suddenly a defender or an attacker short. That killed a lot more of my heroes than the Dol Guldur orks!

First scenario is way too easy.You can only quest with Eowyn if you don't have many characters.If you don't have many allys you don't commit Aragorn to the quest  and promblem solved.

Even if wen revealed effects is the major promblem with this deck you can allways add a taste of will card in this deck.So far i don't have promblem with the wen revealed effects on monster cards so i don't use it.But if someone wants to play this deck and has that type of promblem a test of will can make the job.

Anyway as i said before i like this deck not because its an i win deck but because i enjoy the play style a lot.You know that i am a big fan of Gandalf so with 3x sneak attack and 3x stand and fight  Gandalf comes in play 9 times and if you use Dwarven tomb to bring back stand and fight that means you can have Gandalf 11 times.I think by this example you can understand why i love this deck so much gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

Who's talking about the first scenario? sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

Did you forget to put the spider cards into the encounter deck for the third scenario?

LOL.Yes i don't forget them.Anyway the third scenario is way too hard and the best way to complete it (except luck) is nightmare mode.But for the third scenario i can't speak for sure now cause i am still testing all combinations and then i can say if this scenario is as hard as all say or if there is a way to have a good chance to win.
