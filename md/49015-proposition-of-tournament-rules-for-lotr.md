Proposition of tournament rules for LotRhappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Hello,
I will try to do a tournament in the future ( in 2/3 weeks ) for lord of the rings, but I don't like the FFG rules for tournaments , so I try to do my ownlengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

My goal was to make a 1v1 game.

Two players sit opposite each other, then we determine the starting player.
We need two encounter deck for this game.
The first player shuffle his deck and do the set-up for it. ( i will name him Y )
The second player ( I will name him M ) don't shuffle his encounter deck ( the deck is segregated near M), but do the set-up too.
Both players have the same encounter deck.

lets make Y be the first player.

The game start, both players do the 1st and 2nd phases consecutively, first Y then M.
All the 3rd phase is first done by Y ( in this moment M search his encounter deck for the same cards that appeared during the staging )
Then he proceed to his 3rd phase knowing what card will arrive in play.
Then both players do the 4th and 5th phase consecutively.
During the 6th phase Y fight against the minions of Sauron blind, because he don't see the shadow card,( M search his encounter deck for the shadow cards that appeared in this moment ), so M will know what card will come into play , and he will be prepared for this fight better then Y.
M do his 6th phase seeing all the shadow card. ( in this phase each players fight against his minions not the other players minions )
Then they proceed to the 7th phase

During the second turn the 1st player marker switch between the players , in this situation the second player will be favoured.

The game end after all the players end his quest.

Because many players use and abuse the Gandalf ability , the scoring in the end will be same as in a normal game + 5 pts for each turn played .

All the global effects from cards like the Galadhrim's Greeting, Miner of the Iron Hills, etc. will have his effect on both players Y and M, just for more funhappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I will suggest to ban :
Wandering Took, for his overpowered ability in this situation.
In some situation maybe : Gandalf and Galadhrim's Greeting

In the fact it's a 2 players game where each players play alone , the player who build a better deck and control it well will win.

I will suggest to play a quest with the difficulty level between Journey Down the Anduin and Escape from Dol Guldur, I prefer the hardest onelengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]
I this case the quest will not be too easy and too hard. I don't have the Gollum expansion.

I tested this system with a friend, with Passage Through Mirkwood once and it work.

I know there are some annoying elements and other bad things that maybe need a change.

Tell me what do you think about those rules ,if they are stupid or not, maybe some changes or suggestions ?

Thanks to all the readers, sorry for my bad Englishhappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Good luck

 In my opinion, what really needs some change is the scoring system, because that is apparently an area where they didn´t think things through well enough. And I´m not sure I see the point in making system where players essentially each play their own individual game. But I do see your point of trying to match each player against the same challenges. But I really fear that it could be exploited by making sure you reach critical quest points at times when you are the advantaged player. The greatest problem with this is the fact that with different decks the two players may well end up at different points in their quests due to different questing ability. Then the player that has not advanced will see what the other player faces.

And what do you do when the quests force you to face opponents that your opponent hasn´t reached yet? Making him face the same challenge, with the same shadow cards etc will be difficult to make fair.

And I don´t see the problem with Wandering Took. Since the players are essentially playing individual games, his ability would do nothing.

For me the cooperation is the point. Seeing how well you and other players work together to face the challenges you encounter. That also makes it a game for the player who builds the best deck and plays it the best.

I have a post on an alternate scoring system you should check out.

You could also have the players play in two person teams against each other. When the off team isn't playing they could "play" the encounter deck. They could each hold two-three cards of the encounter deck (drawing whenever they play one) and play them for questing and combat (as shadow cards). Denethor and Henmarth's ability would look at one of these 2 card hands, rather than just the top card. That way the randomness of the encounter deck is controlled by the fact that people are playing it. Plus it would add another dimension of getting good at playing the encounter deck (although this would be pretty simple).

 

Another option would be to use custom 2-part quests. Each player/team picks one quest card for the first part and the second part of the quest. They each then pick half the encounter deck (~15-20 cards) and put it together. They are each somewhat prepared, but will also both be surprised.
