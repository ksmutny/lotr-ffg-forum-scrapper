I have defeated the Spawn as required by 3B in the PTM Quest…but I still have 2 Engaged Enemies. Do I have to defeat them to finish the game?

 

Thanks!

no- as long as you fullfill any requirements to win the quest, it ends then. no clearing up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
