# [Sadly Selling My Collection](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69974-sadly-selling-my-collection/)

First off I would like to say that I am not selling my collection because I don't like the game, but rather because I need to clear out some space and sell some games. (also selling my Warhammer card game too, if you are interested in those as well)

My collection consists of - Core Set

                                          Complete Shadows of Mirkwood

                                          The Massing at Osgiliath POD
 
They are all in Very Good condition and have very rarely been used. If you would like to purchase the collection (I would prefer to sell them all as one set) please e-mail me on ghals (at) hotmail (dot) com. If you would also like the Warhammer collection then please state that too. Reasonable offers will be accepted. I live in the UK and so for ease it may be easier to send to a UK person.

Thanks for your time.

Gazery

Do you have a Paypal account?

Unfortunately I don't, I don't know how easy it is to set up one, but it might be doable.

 Well, I'm not in the UK and I don't want the whole set (I'd like SOM 3-6), but if we can work something out do let me know!

I think I'd prefer to sell the full set together, otherwise I'd end up with a few packs that I can't sell or even use myself. And I wouldn't be able to bring myself to throw them away.

I'd be interested in taking the POD off of you for a reasonable price. Let me know if interested.
