# [Expansion Order](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134687-expansion-order/)

I'm sure this question has been asked before and I'm not sure how to search the forums for it but my question is this: Is it advised that we play the lcg expansions in order and specific to the campaign they belong to? Are there any ramifications of, say, having only a few out of the Shadows of Mirkwood expansions and adding one from the middle of a later expansion?

 

Thank you for your answers!

Corey

From a rules [this forum] standpoint, there's no issue there at all. The only thing to keep in mind is that to play an Adventure pack, you have to have the deluxe pack that precedes it in order to have all the correct encounter sets. In other words, Mirkwood scenarios mix in Core encounter sets, Darrowdelf encounters use Khazad Dum ones, etc. You won't be able to play an adventure without the corresponding deluxe.

 

That said, each AP is its own adventure, and otherwise can be played in any order. Having played Hunt for Gollum yesterday doesn't mean you can't play The Dunland Trap tonight, followed by Return to Mirkwood tomorrow! You might be missing a little of the overarching story (especially in the more recent cycles) that span the cycle from the start of the deluxe to the end of the cycle, but that shouldn't be enough to dissuade you from playing what you want to!

I (and many other players) would recommend buying adventure packs and expansions in the order they were released. You may find these sites/threads helpful in your decision-making:
