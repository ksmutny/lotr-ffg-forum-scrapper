The scenario is that I was blocking an attack with a 1 hp ally and the shadow card came up, deal one damage to defending character. Is that damage applied immediately and then the attack is considered undefended? Or is damage calculated after that when the attack damage is dealt to the defender? Thanks

yes- the damage is applied and the attack is undefended...one of the worst shadow effects to get

Thanks and **** that hurts. I did beat it last night solo with my Gondor deck but on the third try. I played it the way you described but thought maybe I had misplayed it. Thanks again
