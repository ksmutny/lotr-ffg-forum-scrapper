 That is a really neat idea.  Now I'll have to start keeping track of threat level at finish, rather than just win/loss.

Gotta say, I think this is ridiculously cool. I'll have to find my "ancient scroll" of scores and upload them.

pffffff.I must find someone to translate that for me.If i understand well wen i finish a game i can write my score and which heroes i used and then i can compare my score with other people's score?

If i am right i hope that people will not  write fake scores serio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/serio.gif].

 Where's the link to the actual program / web utility?

One bad thing is you can only seem to enter 3 heroes even in a multiplayer game.

Yep. I've been playing dual-handed (2 starter decks but solo) and no use in logging my plays in there.

Playing solo with two decks is in a way a simulation of being two players. Perhaps you should log the game twice with the different heroes.

Or log it as a two player game which it essentially is.

## 11 [scottindeed on May 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47447-lord-of-the-rings-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=475867)

 Yes but even logged as 2 player game, you can only add three heroes

Minor gripe aside, this is a seriously cool feature!

 awesome tool! if ffg keeps this up and brings out more utilites and stuff, this should be a great game... the coolest thing for me... would be a campaign experience for this game... like a biiiiig nightmare mode, where the quests are interlinked storywise... in epic proportions that is... wait and see I guess... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

About the only being able to enter three heroes thing...

 

This is linked to your profile, so this is reflecting YOUR plays. So if you play in a 4 player team, you're only recording your score. Your other friends can record their scores on their profile. At least that's the way I'm reading it.

@weeks and @conkycameleon,

Correct. that would be the appropriate way to log this.

I just logged my first game. Journey down the Anduin, score -24. Since the scoring system is what it is, I went for a perfect score. I don't really like the scoring system and I hope they invent a new one. If there will be any success in the future with tournaments the scoring must be done in a different way. Otherwise the game won't last long as a tournament game.

 Again, where is it that I can log these? I can't find the utility

 nvm found it

Does seem a shame that you can't even note the details of other players in a multi-player game. At the moment I only play solo or against my wife, although others have expressed a vague interest in the game, but nobody else uses the forums/has an FFG profile. For the moment, I'm writing myself a note in the text-box section, but it would be good to have some way of comparing which combinations of 6 or 9 heroes are popular/effective.

(The 3 heroes only thing also means I'll never get above 0% Aragorn usage, as my wife couldn't really contemplate questing without him)

I would like to also ask people to log their quests even if they fail. So we get an even better overview on how easy/hard the quests really are. Even if losing is a downer......lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

 felix! absolutely right! THIS IS ABSOLUTELY vital, that everybody logs in their quests even the failed ones! because... obviously ffg is going to be using the quest log as a balancing tool... and why not, because only us, the community can provide the required data... if we don't log in all our attempts, we may never get a perfectly balanced game... e.g. if ffg sees, that tactics/lore is kind of a weak combination right now, they're going to work on that.... or if spirit is too powerful (just examples...)

 

PEOPLE don't be ashamed if you failed :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I did many many times... just gotta copy my sheet into the quest log now... any day...

It's a nice tool, but it really needs a better option to log multiplayer games. just to log your own heroes doesn't seem sufficient and logging the same game twice/thrice... to log all players that played one particular game is annoying and distorts the statistics.

## 22 [felix16 on May 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47447-lord-of-the-rings-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=477041)

 Get all your friends to register and log their results. We need the info to be as complete as possible.

Hopefully we also get a more refined scoring system that take things such as no of turns int account.

anyone else have a problem with google chrome with the utility. I cannot seem to send the result (though it worked through IE on the same machine)

 For multiplayer games, I wish their was a way to link the entry in your quest log with the entry in your friends quest log to show they were the same game.

I can't get the summary to work, it just keeps asking me to log a quest and I don't have any details with me right now.

 

Do you have to log a quest before you can see the community stats etc? I don't want to create a fake quest just to see the stats which means I'll have to wait until I can fail a quest later... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
