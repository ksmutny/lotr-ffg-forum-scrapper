For those that may not have seen it, the remaining cards from Land of Sorrow have been spoiled on Reddit :

Smoke and Think is a lot of fun, nice to see some development of the pipe-subtheme.  In the right deck, I suppose this will effectively grant 1-3 resources for an Action, which is good... but cards are sometimes as precious as resources (which is why not all decks with Ld and Gondor heroes run Wealth of Gondor).  Still, Spare Pipe is a great Event-fishing attachment, and if it grabs a Smoke a Think it's at least paid for itself with the +1 HP for free.


Bilbo's Plan is better than it looks, I think.  Most decks, especially Tactics decks, can often pull and kill all the enemies each round, especially in multiplayer, while locations can tend to pile up.  The worst thing for combat-capable decks is to sit there without enough staged enemies and wasted characters readied with nothing to block/kill. This event allows you to (1) dilute the Encounter deck by putting the discard back into it (or rehunt for an objective / player encounter that has gotten discarded), (2) potentially filter out some bad treacheries/location, (3) maybe clear a location, and (4) ensure there is an enemy in the Staging Area.  This can help set-up Dunhere, T-Eomer, T-Bilbo, and all the many other cards that key off of having an enemy staged.  It's probably worth it just as fairly reliable location-control for combat-focused decks, but will be especially helpful in setting up those heroes/cards that want enemies in the staging area.

Im not so sure I like this card myself. I always felt that shuffling the discard back in is a bad thing (like those quests in the harad cycle that keep making you reshuffle it). I like the advantage of seeing a nasty card (or 2 or 3 or 4) in the discard and it helps me know what is coming. And it just seems that most quests have a few 1 threat surge type enemies that will almost certainly make this card whiff. A 3 threat enemy could certainly be helpful but 2 threat or less just doesn't seem good. And you have no control over what comes either. I don't know, just my thoughts.

Whether or not you want to reshuffle discard depends on the situation.  If you haven’t seen Southron Support come out yet and the encounter deck is 2/3 empty, seems like a good idea. But anyway, that’s just a feature of the card, not its point. I doubt it will see much play. I could imagine putting it in with tactics Bilbo— I think this is the first in-sphere card that supports his want of having an enemy in staging. Also good for tactics Aragorn, use it when you’ll have him ready with nothing else to do.

Right and that is true, I just find that most quest nowadays theres always bad cards in the discard pile. And everywhere. 

Worth noting (though you probably know this already) is that while the card in nice for Bilbo his ability alone wont let you play Bilbos plan (unless your attacking with him...) because the enemy has to be attacked and destroyed.

It prob won't see much play but perhaps there is a deck that can make it good. Tactics Aragorn is a good idea

Another good point.  There are plenty of quests (especially in the first few cycles) that have one or two just dreaded cards (usually Treacheries, like Exhaustion, Master's Malice, Southron Support, Sleeping Sentry, and the list goes on).  Canceling these cards is ideal, of course, but even if you have in-sphere canceling with your deck more ways to save having to use them is better.  In this case, shuffling the discard back in can help re-dilute the chance of seeing those "cancel or lose" type of cards.   

But yea, the real perk of the card is to give a little possibility for location controls while killing enemies (which you are doing anyways).  Still, it probably only really shine in decks with heroes and cards that key off of staged enemies or want an enemy in play in the Planning Phase for full benefit (e.g. allies that deal damage when played, eg Descendant of Thorondor).

The "most appealing" usage I can think of Ld-Eomer in a deck with Tactics sphere.  Without Fastred, it's rare for him to leave enemies in Staging because he's not conducive to a Secrecy Build.  Slap Spear(s) of the Mark on him and now you can play Bilbo's Plan to hopefully clear a location (progress will be hard to place with Ld/T as two of the heroes) and put an enemy into Staging for Eomer to slap the enemy next turn while he quests.  Even then, if the card whiffs on discarding a location, it's probably a lateral move at best.  Dunhere with some Spears of the Mark could try and Bilbo's Plan, clear a location, and then kill the new enemy before next round.

The end comes is probably considered the worst card in the game. All it does is shuffle the discard back in, which is mostly not helpful. There is that chance where you can attempt to dilute the encounter deck but that may or may not help you anyway. 

But I do like EBerlings suggestion with Dunhere.

Yes, not only does The End Comes *only* shuffle the deck back in, it's conditional, you have to have a dwarf leave play.

If we had a card that shuffled the encounter discard pile back in, and did nothing else, and was not conditional in any way, I suspect it would be used in some scenarios. Wouldn't be popular, but wouldn't be considered useless either.

Red book of werstmarch is great. More than great. It will improve dramatically ally hobbits archetype, making him viable in most quests. And it power up all hobbits on the board,  regardless of the controller. Expansive but worth it and repay itself in a couple of turn.

Im not so sure about that. I dont think the condition of a dwarf leaving play is what makes the end comes terrible. Its the main effect of the card the makes it bad. 

While I was playing through the Haradrim cycle I noticed a lot of encounter quest cards and encounter cards in general were making players shuffle the discard into the encounter deck and discard until... Whatever was revealed. This was an annoying feature that bothered me because all those bad cards that I discarded previously (hello southron champion) are now back in the deck. 

Bilbos plan shuffling the discard back in is not its main affect, but I do think its a negative one.

See it backwards, perhaps you have a thin encounter deck and you know there bad things lurking around for possibly the next quest phase (perhaps you put quite a few bad cards down there with Lore Denethor). Shuffling a lot of encounter cards at your choice could be a good way to lessen the risks. Basically what I am saying is that it's not necessarily a negative effect, it could be positive too (probably averageing on neutral)

Yeah, it's not really the most exciting argument. We're just saying that casting a discard reshuffle as a negative effect is only a half-analysis.

There are a couple of situations described in MDuckworth83's review of The End Comes on RingsDB [https://ringsdb.com/find?q=the+end+comes] that apply to Bilbo's Plan (which gets around the main problem with The End Comes -- it's stupid Dwarf-leaves-play restriction):

>  1. You have scried the encounter deck and see several rounds of terrible options coming your way. Maybe you are almost location locked and the next few encounter cards are locations? Perhaps you are saturated with enemies and you see two more enemies coming your way. Maybe that game ending treachery is in the line-up and you don't have a A Test of Will [https://ringsdb.com/card/01050] yet? Of course this assumes you have a means of scrying, and thus combos with Henamarth Riversong [https://ringsdb.com/card/01060], Rumour from the Earth [https://ringsdb.com/card/02124], Scout Ahead [https://ringsdb.com/card/10009], Palantir [https://ringsdb.com/card/06090], Denethor [https://ringsdb.com/card/01010], and my new favorite scrying tool, Interrogation [https://ringsdb.com/card/12090].
> 
>  2. Speaking of Denethor [https://ringsdb.com/card/01010], it actually combos really great with him and this might be one of the most compelling reasons to use this card. The reason is that due to Denethor [https://ringsdb.com/card/01010]'s ability, you often end up getting an opportunity to bypass really difficult cards and move them to the bottom of the encounter deck. This tends to result in a heavily stacked, nasty "last 5 cards" of the encounter deck when you get to the bottom. The End Comes [https://ringsdb.com/card/04037] let's you bypass these and start fresh with a newly shuffled encounter deck. This also works when you have a treachery or other effect "search encounter deck and discard pile for.. then shuffle" effect that shows you that the remaining 8 cards left at the bottom of the deck aren't the ones that you hope to face.
> 
>  3. Occasionally, there are cards in the encounter deck that got discarded when you didn't want them to. The one that comes to mind is Ranger of the North [https://ringsdb.com/card/09015], but this can also apply to objective allies, objective attachments, or maybe just a particular location that you would rather see in play that not. The End Comes [https://ringsdb.com/card/04037] gives you the means to shuffle these back into the encounter deck once discarded.
> 
>  4. This one is the most quest dependant, but certain quest effects actually trigger off of cards in the encounter deck discard pile. The most obvious example of this are Deadman's Dike with it's dreaded "Cursed Dead" which triggers all other copies to come flying out of the discard pile when revealed. With this card you can reset the discard pile.

There are quests (for example, the first Hobbit quest) where a card shuffling the deck back in would be useful, just in case you haven't got the treasures yet and don't want to accidentally "win" the quest without them.  The End Comes would be a rarely used sideboard card, but it would be a viable sideboard card.  However, the dwarf-leaves-play is a dealbreaker.

In this case the shuffle back in just makes the card near-guaranteed to hit an enemy, but hitting an enemy is no guarantee of hitting a location.  The odds of it hitting successfully should be calculatable before the quest, and will vary enough that it still looks like a sideboard card to me.

Sam's an ally in my deck, which uses Frodo(Le), Folco, and Tom Cotton. Frodo would get it.

Frodo's a better target overall because his ability requires a resource.

Just in case help me see if I am interpreting correctly how Bilbo's Plan work:

After shuffling the encounter back and discarding card until I discard an enemy if there is a location in play with threat equal or lower than that of the enemy I can add the enemy to the staging area to discard the location. But I could also leave the enemy in the discard pile if I don't want to make the "switch" (or if there is no valid target).

Correct or wrong?

I have a question. The last part of Bilbo's Plan says: "Add that enemy to the staging area to discard a a non-unique location with threat equal to or less than that enemy's threat."

It's written like a cost--->effect (pay X to do Y).  You can't pay a cost to do an effect if the effect would not change the game state... so, if there is no appropriate target for the effect of that phrase... Do we not add the enemy to the staging area?

I think that's just beyond wishful thinking and I'm sure you still have to add the enemy. But I'd like to hear where my reasoning is wrong.

That's what I think -- you are *not* required to make the switch.  The card merely causes shuffle and discard-to-enemy -- chosing to add that enemy to staging is optional, even if possible (which it might not be).

Which makes this card a *little* more attractive against a quest where you hate the enemies -- if the remaining deck is enemy heavy, shuffle them back in, discard to one of them and leave it in the discard where it belongs!  It might be handy for Shadow of the Past after all....

I'll go further, since it's written like a cost -> effect you don't have to do it even if there *is* a valid target.  Frankly, if you add to the staging area *every time* whether you can discard a location or not, this would be the most terrible player card ever released since the original Raven of the Mountains.

I think if you decided to trigger the response you do have to resolve every line, unless that line says “you may.” It would be awkward if you had the option of skipping a line that doesn’t say “you may.”

I think that in the case you highlighted where there just isn't a location with matching or lower threat to discard, you *can't* resolve the last line anyways.  I could see ruling that you have to do it if there is a valid target, though this makes this very sideboardy card far more sideboardier.  Would this have any rivals in this cycle or the previous one for the most useless player card released?

It’s probably the weakest card we’ve seen recently... but i kind of like that. Oddball underpowered cards do a lot more for my deckbuilding drive than obvious power cards like the Book here.

## 28 [dalestephenson on May 15, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308432-land-of-sorrow-remaining-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3940100)

So what quests would this be good for, if your goal is actual location dismissal and you're not just trying to keep your combat deck busy while avoiding location lock from 3-4 player play?

Deadman's Dike benefits from shuffling the discard back due to Cursed Dead, but their 1 threat is unlikely to dismiss any location.  But it shares the encounter deck with Dread Lord, whose forced engaged effect puts the topmost undead in play with you.  It's 3 threat so it has excellent chance of discarding a location -- but there are less copies of it than there are of Cursed Dead.

Those two are in three quests, and the best of the lot for the effect is Dread Realm, I think.  The final quest stage is beaten by getting rid of locations, which is what this does.  You advance from stage two into stage three by defeating Daechnar, so the stage two/three transition should happen *before* you can trigger this card, and it helpfully ensures that there's a location in staging.  Plus Alter of Midwinter will helpfully give you an easy enemy to kill (reanimated dead) to try to take out another location popping up.  But what are the discard odds?

Enemies:

2x Dread Lord (3 threat)

5x Cursed Dead (1 threat)

3x Dwimmerlake (4 threat)

3x Witch of Angmar (3 threat)

2x Wraith of Carn Dum (2 threat)

So if no enemies were in play when the card was played, you'd get 100% on 1-threat, 2/3 on 2-threat, 8/15 on 3-threat, and 1/5 on 4-threat.  Worth a gamble, since due to quest setup any enemy is likely better than any location at that point in the quest.  Unholy crypt is a particularly good target, since it's 1 threat if you've cleaned up the reanimated dead, and with 7 progress is one of the toughest locations to clear.

I play Dori fellowships, so I have a soft spot for deemed-weak cards with situational strengths.  What I don't like is player cards that are actively harmful, which this would certainly be if you always had to add the enemy.

Discarding the starting location (Accursed Battlefield) might be handy in Carn Dum, though the enemy-kill requirement prevents you from discarding it before having to Battle quest on turn one.  With 2 threat the Carn Dum Garrisons and Orc Grunts won't trigger it, though you start with N Garrisons in play, somewhat improving your odds.  Against the 4-7 1 threat enemies in the deck there are 10 2+ threat in the deck, Angmar Orc would be the best hit since it nerfs the When Revealed effect.  Carn Dum has no obnoxious 1-threat locations.

I guess in a Tactics deck I might prefer a Beorning Guardian (or even better Meneldor) as a way to clear locations. Though I guess the small advantage of Bilbo's Plan is that it *discards* the location which can be better than exploring it (especially in later quests where it's more easy to find location with negative "when explored" effects.

I wonder if there is some good use for this card (Treasures aside) in the Hobbit saga.

Fate of Numenor might be a good target for this card.  The mechanics replace the Lost Island in staging when they become active locations -- but this *discards* the location, permanently reducing the number of Lost Islands in staging.  At 2 threat, the Lost Island will hit on anything but the two 1-threat surgers.

Assault on Osgiliath could also be good since all the locations have only 1-2 threat.

It'd be downright great against Assault on Osgiliath if it worked on unique locations too.

There's some decent targets in Emyn Muil.

I would say to perfect Bilbo's plan, I would have the following text:

"After an enemy is destroyed, shuffled the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and discard cards until you discard an enemy whose threat is equal to or higher than a non-unique location in the staging area. Discard that location and add that enemy to the staging area."

I think everyone would love that interpretation.

about that point in particular. Nobody here is saying the effect is strong, but some of us are definitely saying that it would be a very good sideboard card *if* if wasn’t relying on a dwarf leaving play.

But a dwarf leaving play is not an insurmountable obstacle. Im just very surprised to hear that the end comes without the dwarf restriction is even considered playable. It might dilute the encounter deck but not necessarily in your favour. Its just a bad card even without the dwarf leaving play.

Sideboard, situational. To be used when the situation is correct. I think what we disagree on is the likelihood of a “correct” situation ever coming up in a game. 
 

Just different play styles I guess

Yeah I guess different play styles would affect our opinion of a card. I would prob never use it as sideboard card, but while I disagree on its usefulness that is only my opinion of course. 

I actually use my The End Comes as a proxy for The Shirefolk😀.

As sideboardy as Bilbo's Plan is, the excitement of new player cards drove away from my mind what it is *not* -- a non-restricted attachment that allows taking Eagles out of play for a benefit.  IOW's Gwaihir's ability to ready *at all* is at the mercy of the existing card pool.  In that light, I seriously question the decision not to give Gwaihir a threat discount for his card, and I think I prefer MotK-Gwaihir at 10 threat.

I played with Gwaihir a bit. He really would have benefited from the crown that let him either pay for eagles, pay for their abilities or readied him in refresh. As it is, you need both leadership and spirit help in tactics heavy deck (you basically need steward, this deck is uber costly and you need courage for the late game when you're out of eagles). He's a hero where you AND your team need to build around him. He's on the weaker side without it. PS: One of his best activators is elf-stone in lore, so another sphere needed.

I really like the look of the Gwaihir hero and cant wait to try him myself. His downside is big, but a deck packed full of eagles should be able to get him readied a lot.

You could have a total of 22 eales in your deck.

3 vassal

3 guardian

3 emissary

3 wilyador

3 EOMM

3 Descendants

3 Meneldors

1 Landroval.

Now with card draw (eagles are coming) and some return events like meneldors flight and flight of the eagles (3 more eagle allies!) it seems like there are lots of options.

Also I like that any sphere can combine nicely with him, or you can just go mono sphere

I paired him with Hirgon and Radagast for a really solid mid-game deck. It absolutely has an expiration date when you begin to run out of eagles.

There are a lot of Eagles-leaves-play options, and it's nice to give an incentive to use cards like Meneldor's Flight and Born Aloft.  The pack did come with two more Eagles to leave play and ready Gwaihir (or more importantly, buff Misty).  However, Gwaihir's readying via Eagle removal is limited to once per phase, meaning he would have been fairly priced for threat *without the readying restriction*.  He's overcosted, and that's no small thing in such an expensive hero.

Well I dont think his once per phase restriction is a big limit at all. You cant afford to have 3 eagle allies leaving play (and readying Gwaihir 3 times) in one phase or you would run out of allies in a real hurry! \

I can definitely see times where you will want him ready but he's not... And that's gonna hurt. But he is not over costed. His stats added together equal 13 and that dictates his threat cost (aside from a few heros who break that mold). He has a drawback, but he has a benefit too.

And lets not forget that he starts with ranged and sentinel.

Thats a good question. I ran it through Aprils solo league. I would guess 10 rounds is right around the dying point. It struggles early with resources but once you get a few eagle related carda you can get the ball really rolling. Yes, Hirgon and Radagast nonbo with each other but it actually allows multiple avenues of readying Gwahir, which is helpful

Unless we get them both in pack 6, it also appears that we will not be getting leadership and spirit guarded cards. A leadership guarded enemy card that focuses on defense could have really helped out Dunedain. We also still don't have any more Rohan cards as Caleb said she would. Pack 6 will have to have it.

10 rounds sounds like a fairly average game. Maybe Gwaihirs biggest weakness is lengthy games (ghost of Framsburg).

I really like the idea of Hirgon with Gwaihir. The discount plus the potential ready for Gwaihir after questing seems really good.

The last time he was on Cardtalk, which was after Challenge of the Wainriders hit, he said that they are really trying to make Rohan a top tier archetype this cycle and that the new cards that are yet unspoiled will help with that. At the moment, the main thing they need is healing. We got some needed card draw already.

Yeah Horn of the Mark felt big for Rohan. When I listened to that episode, I thought he was referring to the Horn of the Mark specifically, and also the muster of Rohan

The problem with the Bard/Born Aloft combo is that you have to discard the attachment to return to hand, so you don't get the attachment back.  If it instead just discarded attached ally, the combo would work -- indeed, that was my first thought for Playing Gandalf Every Turn, but I had to resort to Elf-friend and Elvenking to make it work.

That episode came out 4 weeks after Challenge of the Wainriders. It's possible, but I feel I'm at least reasonably hopeful that we'll get at least 1 more card. Now he could have been talking about MotK which gave us Hero Gamling as well as a bunch if other Rohan heroes.

I've played a lot of Radagast-Eagles prior to Gwaihir being spoiled, and I've played a lot of Gwaihir-Hero since.

He's definitely a solid hero, and the eagle archetype is potent, though I too was really really hoping for a Tactics Eagle attachment to help out (I would have bet big on a "The Wind-Lord" title). 

Elrond/Hirgon + Radagast + Gwaihir  are the builds I've tried most.  I've only had a problem readying Gwaihir in one game out of about two dozen, but quests that are particularly harsh about discarding your hand and/or your resources have the potential to leave Gwaihir totally out to pasture.  Otherwise, I've found he's very easy to ready 2-3 times per turn (ready in Planning Phase by playing an Eagle, Ready after questing through Hirgon/Vilya/Emmissary, then ready during combat as a Winged Guardian or Vassal leaves play.  Then sprinkle in Meneldor's Flight / Flight of the Eagles / Born Aloft / Gwaihir's Debt / (Sneak Attack if you want to mess with getting Leadership access) as needed for extra readies.

The basic archetype is good. though the deck does basically build itself for better or worse (e.g. I use the exact same 3x every eagle ally except for a singleton Landroval as has already been posted here).  It can really struggle with Threat if it doesn't set up some plays of Gandalf, it can be a bit lacking in questing Willpower, and it has no cancellation/control against Treacheries (unless you go the Elrond+Vilya for Test of Will route).  As such, it's got some weaknesses in particular quests, especially 1-Handed.

But it's certainly a viable archetype, and Hero-Gwaihir is nice as a hero.  With Gwaihir + Radagast, you basically have two heroes that will almost always quest and still be readied for combat.  It's viable.  But I don't really find Gwaihir Hero versions to be a lot more powerful than versions with some other Tactics hero (e.g. Legoas/Eowyn/Beorn/Grimbeorn) and Gwaihir ally, since Gwaihir Ally is a great ally that is the only way in sphere to get recursion on eagles that have discarded themselves in the early game.  Eagles are still probably much less powerful and less flexible than, say, the Silvan Archetype which is probably it's closest relative, so it'd be nice to see an attachment someday in the vein of something like the Elven-King or O Loien!, especially since so many themes have something (even Harad has Khaliel's Headress).

It's true that without the limit on readying, you wouldn't be able to repeatedly ready him multiple times or you would run out of allies -- but that just shows why the readying limit is *unneccessary*, and the limit prevents him from using his ablity repeatedly in the rare times where it would be worth the cost.

He has the same readying limit as Boromir, but Boromir's readying is cheaper, can always be done, Boromir readies normally as well, and has a (barely ever used) secondary positive ability.  He also has multiple combat attachments that work with his trait and can take restricted attachments.

Yes, sum of stats is typically used to calculate threat cost, but the vast majority of sum-of-stat heroes do not have a negative ability.  Of the heroes with a negative ability, very few are so harmful as the inability to ready normally.  Gwaihir is the only hero in the game where if the cards come out in the wrong order, will be able to do *nothing*.  Let's look at the negative ability heroes:

Glorfindel -- +1 threat when exhausting to quest, easily worked around with cheap attachment in same pack.  Costed at -7 threat.

Beorn -- immune to card effects and can't have attachments, but also doesn't exhaust to defend and is costed at -4 threat.

Galadriel -- can't attack, defend, or quest.  That *would* be a crippling limitation for most heroes, but her stat distribution means she's only a quester, and she comes with a cheap attachment in the same pack that allows her to effectively quest.  And she also comes with a passive boost to *all* your allies when entering play plus an exhaustion ability among the most useful in the game (card and threat reduction).  Costed at +1 threat, and a bargain at that price.

Erestor -- discards all your cards at end of turn.  Positive ability compensates by drawing an extra *3* cards per turn, sum of stats and considered very powerful.

Treebeard -- can't have restricted attachments (true also of Gwaihir).  Can self damage to boost willpower/attack up to *5* times per phase.  Sum of stats, very powerful.

Na'asiyah -- can't pay for allies.  Can use resources to buff attack/defense by 2 per resource.  Costed at -1 threat, not widely used.

Quickbeam -- can't have restricted attachments (true also of Gwaihir).  Can self-damage to ready (once per phase).

Smeagol -- can't have attachments and you can lose control with Stinker encounter cards.  -6 threat cost.

That's it.  Only Smeagol and Galadriel have negative abilities that on their face are anywhere near as harmful as Gwiahir's lack of normal readying, and they compensate for it with Gollum's extreme threat discount (1/3 of sum of stats) and Galadriel's two powerful positive abilities and ease of working around the questing restriction.

Gwaihir shares his 13 cost with Treebeard, Saruman and Elrond, and is just one less than the highest threat cost hero, Gandalf.  *None* of those heroes have a huge drawback like Gwaihir, and except for Treebeard they have marvelous toys to go with them.  (Treebeard does have Wellinghall Preserver).  He's not in their league.

It's not like readying is some ultra powerful effect that requires such an extreme disadvantage to compensate.  *Lots* of heroes have readying effects and all of them require a less expensive precondition (to board state) than playing an Eagle or taking an Eagle off the table.  And every last one of them readies normally.

The one good thing about Gwaihir is that he's rewarded for what Eagle decks want to do anyways -- play Eagles and let them flit out of play for leaves-play effects and/or buffing Misty.  But the reverse isn't true -- Gwaihir does practically *nothing* to enable Eagle decks!  (The lone exception is fulfilling half of the requirement for Gwaihir's Debt).  He also blocks his ally version, which actually *does* have an enters play ability that works well with an Eagles deck.

Yes, he has sentinel and ranged, but as he can't take restricted attachments that's not quite as useful as it would otherwise be -- in Tactics, the only attack or defense boosting attachments he can use without trait-adding is Support of the Eagles and Keeping Count.  That's pretty thin gruel for buffing a heroic defender, aside from the fact that a heroic defender *who can't be guaranteed to be able to make even one defense* is a big, big problem.

It's a huge missed opportunity.  His ability is restricted for no good reason, his normal readying is removed for no good reason, he has no ability to help Eagles decks (as opposed to them helping him), and now we learn that he doesn't come with some nifty Eagle attachment to make all his defects worthwhile and really make Eagles shine.  This isn't to say he's unplayable bad, only that he's overcosted and he's not by any stretch of the imagination an Eagles enabler.  Radagast (hero) is going to be an Eagles deck fixture going forward, but I don't think Gwaihir will be.

Well summarized but there is always hope that the final pack contains a crown of the wind-lord attachment that helps him in some other way, preferably with readying and draw/eagle recursion from discard pile.

One thing worth mentioning though is the attachment Support of the Eagles. Every Gwaihir hero deck will be stuffed with eagle allies and so that card is a amazing fit for him. While Gwaihir can't have restricted attachments and thus can't have weopons, he doesn't need them. One (or 2) support of the eagles and Gwaihir will be a beast. With ranged and sentinel he will be able to use Support of the Eagles to the fullest. So even though I wish he had come with a wind lord attachment, he kinda had a perfect attachment all along.

EBerling did a nice write-up earlier in the thread about the hero Gwaihir and how he performed in his deck. Im very glad to hear that he is viable and can't wait to eventually try him myself. His ranged/sentinel definitely looks good in multiplayer. 

One last thing is that the other 13 threat heros, other than Elrond, do have a significant drawback. Treebeard needs large amounts of healing (in general I get the vibe from the community that he is not a popular hero). Saruman interferes with your threat reduction which can be significant if your playing a lot of doomed.

Treebeard needs large amounts of healing (in general I get the vibe from the community that he is not a popular hero). Saruman interferes with your threat reduction which can be significant if your playing a lot of doomed. 

*Anybody* is a beast if you put 1-2 Support of the Eagles on them in an Eagles deck.  It's true that Gwaihir's ranged/sentinel will (in multiplayer) allow him to use his Supports most widely -- if he's ready, which relies on cooperation from his deck and altering your board state.

For thirteen threat, I don't want "viable", I want "awesome".  Gwaihir isn't, and he could have been and IMO should have been.

Treebeard does need healing to repeatedly exercise his boost, but he's Lore and the best non-unique Ent allies (Welliinghall Preserver) can automatically restore health on him -- it's a lot easier to provide healing in Lore than provide extra readying in Tactics.  Plus he only needs to use self-damaging when required -- it's not every hero capable of questing for six or attacking for seven on turn one no matter what is in your opening hand.  Treebeard has a *huge* problem in an Ent deck, though, and it's that he blocks his absolutely amazing ally version.  Treebeard ally is an *important* Ent deck enabler.  Suppose Gwaihir blocked Misty, how would you feel about him?

Saruman's threat reduction nerf does count as a significant disadvantage, but his pack comes with a Staff that can flat-out eliminate low Doomed values, and he has no limit on his readying.  Gwaihir's not in his class.  If Gwaihir had come with some attachment that mitigated his disadvantage and synergized with Eagles play, I'd feel *much* better about his hero card.  But he didn't.  Maybe it'll come out next pack, but my hopes for that are approximately zero.

What I mean by this is that Support of the Eagles is an easy and perfect inclusion in every single deck that features Gwaihir as a hero. Since his deck will always be chalk full of eagle allies it will always fit. Any other hero that wants to use that attachment is gonna need to include a bunch of eagle allies, thus eliminating valuable space for other cards.

I do not really see a problem with Gwaihir. Other heroes need a way to get ranged and sentinel through Arwen, Dúnedain Cache/Signal, Rivendell Bow, Elven Mail, Armour of Erebor or Shadowfax. Gwaihir needs an Unexpected Courage and still can ready often enough with his response. Of course that means, in a solo game, where his keywords hardly do anything, he is less useful and I would have liked an attachment for him to fix his downside.

I'd actually contend by noting that I find Support of the Eagles to be neither easy nor perfect to include. I don't run it in any of my versions of Gwaihir decks.  I think it's a lack-luster card, tbh, since at 3 Tactics cost, it's very pricey. 

1. Resource Limitation 
If you go the TacticsHero + Radagast + Gwaihir route, it means you're saving resources from one round to the next to be able to afford 3 Tactics resources, and if you go the Elrond+Radagast+Gwaihir route you're saving for three turns to be able to play it (and this assumes you aren't using that one Tactics resource to Gwaihir's Debt or pay to retain the services of any Emissaries/Guardians/Wilyador).  I tend to not have much in the way of spare resources -- you're typically paying to play the same eagle allies multiple times (usually Meneldor or maybe even Descendant), and you need to be playing at least one new Eagle every planning phase (perhaps to ready Gwaihir and so that Radagast can quest without exhausting).  And Meneldor, Eagle Flock, Descendant of Thorondor, and Landroval are already expensive cards that take at least a turn of resources to play (though the Staff helps a lot here).  Hirgon can also help a little bit with his economy boost, but then you're still wanting to spend resources in planning to play an Eagle to ready Gwaihir and enable Radagast AND spending at least one resource after questing to take advantage of Hirgon's ability to save a resource and ready Gwaihr.  Very rarely do I find my Gwaihir decks sitting around with extra resources, and even when I do I'm typically thinking about just using those resources on more eagles or Gandalf (who hopefully first came out via Gwaihir's Debt).

2. Deck Space Limitation
I know most of you are probably just thinking "duh, just Vilya drop it, then money is meaningless."  It's true that Vilya-Elrond routes have an easier time with economy, and Elrond is a natural mechanical and thematic pairing with Eagles and Gwaihir.  But Vilya-variants have a much harder time with deck space since they really want to be a lean 50 cards for combo-building consistently and you need to devote a lot of deck space to other things that aren't support of the Eagles: Finding a spare card sleeve or three for Support of the Eagles is, again, tough and even if you can find the space you still may be better served not using Vilya or your 1-per-turn Tactics resources on Support of the Eagles.  It's also worth nothing that if you Vilya an Eagle, it doesn't enable Radagast to quest without exhausting, so there is still some motivation to be actually spending resources in Planning to play the cheaper Eagles.

A concrete example: if you do 1x Landroval, 3x all the other Eagles, 3x Daerun's Runes, 3x Vilya, 3x Pipe, 3x Staff, 3x Eagles are Coming!, 3x Flight of the Eagles, 3x Gandalf, 3x Gwaihir's Debt, and 3x A Test of Will that's already 49 cards, and I have a hard time thining about how to run Elrdond + Gwaihir without something like this as a foundation.  Odds are most players probably want some combo-smoothing too (eg Word of Command, Gather Info, Heed the Dream, Master of the Forge), some Gandalf Recursion (Born Aloft), some more Debt/Vilya/Draw setup (Gildor), a few other key Vilya Targets (Firyal, Legolas, Steward of Gondor, etc) and possibly even some healing, 'cuz Elrond (Warden).  This is not much space for Support of the Eagles to make a case for a sleeve.... 

3. It's Overkill ("win more")
It can enable some really powerful Gwaihir-ing, sure, but it strikes me as a win-more card.  You don't have much need for a giant-stats defensive Gwaihir when part of what an Eagle deck is happy and sometimes eager to do is to sacrifice it's cheap birds on chump blocking.  And as it's doing that, it's building up a big flock under the Eagles of the Misty Mountains, who will pretty quickly be able to start putting up blocks at 5+ defense themselves (it's not uncommon to have a 8-10 Defense flock--Wilyador and Eagle Emissary can really power up the flock).  At this point, why bother setting up a defensive SotE Gwaihir?  Sure, he can use the Flock's stat to boost his own even higher ("It's OVER 9,000!!!!!!!"), but are you really going to need a that big of a block in most quests?  Sentinel is nice, but the Winged Guardians and Wilyador and even Landroval can be used to pick up defensive slack for other players, too.  Alternatively, I have yet to find my Gwaihir decks wanting for offensive output.  Usually, barring the enemy-heaviest quests, I find I'm sitting there each combat phase with unused attack power because everything is already dead.  There are moments when attack output is insufficient, but they are so rare I'd think a Black Arrow would do the trick as a silver bullet against Big Boss, and unlike SotE it's free and gives an immediate +5 attack boost, which would take at least three Eagles under the flock to replicate via SotE.


So, yea, I think Support of the Eagles is one of the most 'meh' cards in the game...and I'd say an Eagles deck is probably made strictly worse by including it, for the three reasons above... and I've played Eagles as my predominant archetype since getting into the game around Fate of the Wilderlands' release (I've always loved Radagast since the Middle-Earth CCG).


There is one caveat to all of this, though.  In a Fellowship of 2-4 players, you can set up a situation where a Tactics player is playing Supports of the Eagles on Gwaihir (ideally three of them) and then at some key point in the quest throws down Hour of Wrath on Gwaihir so that he can Sentinel block everything and Ranged attack everything.  Bar absolutely none, Gwaihir is the best candidate for Hour of Wrath in the entire game, and fueled by a pair of Support of the Eagles "Hour of Wrath" might as well be a "Wrath of God" from MtG (pending a quest with gnarly shadow effects that can totally ruin Gwaihir's best laid plans, since he has absolutely no access to Shadow-Cancellation outside of Response Events).  But, this can let Gwaihir basically block and then wipe the board himself.  But in my experience there are very, very few quests where that level of "beast mode... activated" is needed (pun intended), and even then all the setup the Tactics deck has invested into it (at least 10-13 tactics resources) could have likely been spent in other ways that also could deal with the enemy surge.  And even in this scenario... Support of the Eagles is still not being run in the Gwaihir/Eagles deck itself.





tl;dr: Support of the Eagles is, in my opinion, a bad card.  Maybe not as bad as To the Eyrie (poor Eagles), but close.  That is not to say Gwaihir or Eagles are bad: Gwaihir is a good hero, at least in my (limited) experience.  An Eagle-Attachment would have been very welcomed and likely would not break Gwaihir/Eagles in any way (I think they're well behind other archetypes still, and likely not even the best archetype focused on entering/exiting allies), but such an attachment is not needed for Eagle viability (I've run Eagles/Gwaihir and cleared the entirety of Mirkwood, Dwarrowdelf, Against the Shadow, and most of the LotR Saga in a 3-Player Fellowship, where Gwaihir + Valiant Warrior + Intimidation is extra deadly).

I love Support of the Eagles in my Eagles deck.  Outside of an Eagles deck, it is little used, for obvious reasons.  If running it you are also committing to at least 3x Guardian and 3x Vassal, and you likely want 2-3 Misty as well -- and by that point, you might as well make it an Eagles deck.

But EBerling makes good points -- it's an expensive card for often resource-starved Eagles decks.  It takes up deck space that could be used for other things -- especially with Gwaihir hero, who *needs* otherwise marginal cards like Meneldor's flight and Born Aloft to help him ready.  Especially on attack it is often "win more".  It also annoyingly doesn't have the Eagles trait, so it can't be pulled with The Eagles Are Coming.

But still, I love it so, because while three tactics resources is expensive, with just Guardian and Vassal alone it gives you the choice of +3 attack and +4 defense, and it does that *without* taking a Restricted slot and without a once per hero limitation.  That's *especially* useful for defending heroes, as it can set up boss-level defense on virtually any combat hero, while having the flexibility to give you massive attack.  And it grows with Misty as the game goes on.  I love this card....

And hero Gwaihir loves this card too, because it's the only tactics card in the entire cardpool that can reliably boost his attack or defense *at all*.  As ranged/sentinel he can take advantage of both attack and defense support with.  Gwaihir will love to have this card.  But what I'm not convinced of is that this card loves to be *on Gwaihir*, because he may not be readying!  If I'm spending three resources to make sure I have a defender who can stop a dragon or balrog cold every single turn, I want a defender I can guarantee won't be sitting there exhausted at turn start with no Eagles left in hand to play.  Eagles decks are at least double tactics, if I'm solo (where Gwaihir's ranged/sentinel is worthless) I'll be putting it on another combat hero if there is one, and if I'm a multiplayer combat deck I'll put it on a different sentinel hero if there is one, no matter who it is.  Because any other sentinel hero is not at the mercy of his deck to ready *at all*, and they typically can take a lot of *other* useful attachments besides just this one.

This is my main objection to Gwaihir as released -- yes, he loves to be in an Eagles deck; in fact he's flat out worthless outside of an Eagles deck.  Spirit Pippin is more useful outside a hobbit deck than Gwaihir is outside an Eagles deck.  But I don't see that an Eagles deck loves to have Gwaihir be one of the three heroes, except for Gwaihir's Debt an Eagles deck doesn't benefit from having *him*.  If he'd done something to ramp up his Eagle allies, rather than being utterly reliant on them to keep him doing anything at all, he'd be a more interesting and more useful hero.

Interesting points, SotE is definitely an expensive card. I was surprised to hear that you don't like it though. Its very powerful and worth the 3 cost since it usually is boosting stats by at least 3. I also have a more limited cardpool than you EBerling (assuming you own most/all the game?) so slotted in SotE will be easier for me.

Of course that means, in a solo game, where his keywords hardly do anything, he is less useful and I would have liked an attachment for him to fix his downside.

The situation is not symetrical.  Being without ranged/sentinel is not comparable to being a ready short in impact; if you lack ranged or sentinel in a combat deck you're still able to fight the enemies you are engaged with -- which as a combat deck is likely to be all of the most dangerous enemies anyway.  But if you're not ready, you can't do *anything*.  Gwaihir has a non-removable Caught in the Web on him that can't be overcome with resources, that's not remotely the same impact as lacking ranged/sentinel.

Plus, lots of heroes start with ranged *or* sentinel and don't especially need the other trait.  There are also a lot of attachments that can do it, all of which except the Cache/Signal can confer other benefits as well.  Meanwhile, there are only two attachments into the entire pool that can go on Gwaihir to repeatedly ready him -- Unexpected Courage (out of sphere, 1-per-core-set), and Magic Ring (1 per deck).  Those cards also happen to be extraordinarily useful on *other* heroes who have exhausting abilities, or can get to higher combat values via restricted attachments and/or abilities.  As much as Gwaihir needs Unexpected Courage, I don't think it needs him.

Being less useful in solo play is also a big strike against a hero, as Dori and TaBrand can tell you.

That leaves the "often enough".  Often enough for what?  It's likely in the early stages of an Eagles game that you'll be playing an Eagle every turn, meaning that Gwaihir is very likely to be ready, as any other hero would be *without* relying on your draw to provide the allies you want to play anyway.  And as the game progresses you'll get some extra readies *for free* from Eagles leaving play naturally, instead of having to pay for an extra ready like Boromir or Elladan would.  It really is a nifty ability, and if Gwaihir readied normally the free action advantage would make him reasonably attractive (though I'd prefer he do something that benefits Eagles rather than the other ways around).  But when the allies run dry and he's resorting to Born Aloft and Meneldor's Flight to ready *at all*, you're not talking about free readying anymore and you aren't enjoying action advantage.

(His free readying would also be more useful if it weren't limited to once per phase, I have no clue why the designers thought that was necessary given the cost and timing of his triggering events.)

Looking at the timings for Gwaihir's "free" readies, without going out of sphere...

Planning and playing Eagles is the obvious one, this will substitute for the "normal" readying every other hero gets.  Should fine as long as you have Eagles to play and resources to play them with.  Will allow him to quest for two, or stay ready for combat.

If Eagle of the North happens to come out of the encounter deck, this could ready a questing Gwaihir; tactics lack scrying so this would be fortitously good luck.

If Eagle Emissary is used to quest and not paid for, it leaves play after questing.  This allows Gwaihir to ready after questing.

If Hirgon is also in the deck and you quested successfully, he can play an Eagle at a discount and allow Gwaihir to ready after questing -- this requires two Eagles in hand for action advantage, one to ready him during planning and one to play with Hirgon's ability.  If Hirgon is used for the only Eagles play, Gwaihir gets his "normal" ready here, and only if you quested successfully.

If Winged Guardian is used to defend and not paid for; it leaves play after defending.  This allows Gwaihir to ready in the combat phase *after a defense has already happened*

If Landroval leaves play to rescue a destroyed hero it will give Gwaihir a free ready -- this is most likely in the combat phase after a defense, and isn't something you hope to see at all.

If Vassal of the Windlord is used to attack it leaves play.  This allows Gwaihir to ready in the combat phase *after an attack has already happened*.

If Wilyador is not paid for at the end of a round it leaves play, substituting for the "normal" refresh ready for the following turn.

Born Aloft and Meneldor's Flight can be played/used in any action window to ready Gwaihir.  The most likely point to use them depends on the ally:

Eagle Emissary -- after questing to avoid discard

Meneldor -- to place two progress, most likely quest or travel phase

Descendent of Thorondor -- to place two damage in staging, most likely in quest or encounter phase

Winged Guardian -- after defending to avoid discard

Vassal of the Windlord -- after attacking to defend discard

Gwaihir's Debt, which Gwaihir enables the Eagle half at game start, can be used in any action window, but the best use of this card is to play core Gandalf with Radagast hero (setting up with pipe), which won't ready Gwaihir.

Readying in the planning phase or end of round never provides action advantage, only substitutes for the readying he didn't get.  It's only the later triggers that provide any actual action advantage.  Emissary/Meneldor/Thorondor allows Gwaihir to quest and be used in combat, as a two-willpower quester this is useful, but not dramatic.  Guardian allows him to ready after the Guardian makes a defense, setting up a natural quest/attack combo but requiring multiple defenses needed to set up a a defense/attack combo or a defense/defense combo.  Vassal allows him to ready after the Vassal makes an attack, requiring an additional attack target for the action advantage to be any use at all.

The once per phase restriction nearly confines him to two exhaustions in the combat phase without further help.  TaMerry can ready him if they attack together and destroy an enemy, as could TaBrand if in a different deck destroying an Eagles-engaged enemy, but that only enables attacking against another target (although it *will* keep him ready for next turn if you don't have an Eagle to play in planning).  Rohan Warhorse is restricted and can't go on him, Swift and Strong requires a weapon and also won't work.  Hold Your Ground will ready him for 1 cost in any action window.  The Outmatched trap on an enemy will ready a defending Gwaihir.  I think that exhausts the options inside tactics.  As noted above, Hour of Wrath (4 cost) will let him attack/defend without exhausting, assuming he's already been readied by something.  I don't see any other Tactics options to let him attack/defend without exhausting.

Outside tactics you have repeatable readying from UC and Magic Ring.  There are also some non-tactics heroes who could ready Gwaihir at other times than post-attack.  Frodo can ready another hero questing with him; which if he's in another deck could be used part of the time.  LeGimli can ready another hero when defending.  SpLegolas can ready another hero when questing.  Those aren't free readies, but they are repeatable.

So what you’re saying is that there are more ways to ready Gwaihir than any other hero in the game 

## 71 [dalestephenson on May 17, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308432-land-of-sorrow-remaining-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3940752)

Not really.  If you count every variation of "Eagle enters play" and "Eagle leaves play" as being a different way to ready, then you should also count every Doomed card as a different way to ready Saruman -- and with Grima being able to give Doomed to practically every card in the pool, that's *by far* the most in the game.

If you compare Gwaihir to TaBoromir you get ways to ready:

Gwaihir for free when Eagles enter play or leaves play (once per phase for both combined).

Boromir for free at end of round, plus once per phase for raising threat.

Aside from event/attachments/heroes that work on both, you also have:

---Attachments--

Heir of Mardil for Boromir (requires resource gain)

Rohan Warhorse for Boromir (restricted, requires destroying enemy)

Steed of the Mark for Boromir (requires resource when questing)

Ring of Power for Boromir (requires restricted One Ring) 

---Events--

Hold Your Ground for Gwaihir

Desparate Defense for Gwaihir (requires defense with no damage)

Swift and Strong for Boromir (requires destroying an enemy)

Behind Strong Walls for Boromir

While Unexpected Courage is only once in a core set, that is no reason to only include one copy in your or your ally's deck. And with Support of the Eagles and some eagle allies you can easily reach 7 attack and defense, allowing you to drop the unusable restricted attachments out of your deck. At the time when you will have run out of eagles, Born Aloft, Flight of the Eagles and Meneldor's Flight, you very likely will have found at least a single copy of UC.

There are 5 non-unique, non-encounter eagle allies which you can play 3 times each. 3 eagles are unique (Gwaihir excluded), so you can only have one in play at a time, but especially Wilyador can be used to ready Gwaihir at the end of the round. 4 of these eagles have a forced discard, 3 of which can be prevented through paying a resource. That means you can ready Gwaihir at least 5*3+3*1=18 times in different planning phases (counting the uniques only once), at least 11 times in combat phases (3 times each for Vassal, Guardian, Descendant, once for Landroval and Meneldor), 3 times in quest phases for the Emissary and at least once for Wilyador at the end of a round. With careful planning this can ready Gwaihir for 33 rounds, which is more than enough time to find UC or threat out. And even if you use his stats twice in the combat phase, this will be enough for 16 rounds, which is still longer than most games I have played. And while the Eagles of the North are not reliable, they can save you a response from Hirgon for another round and add another eagle which can leave play. Interestingly the combined resource cost of all cards is 48, which also take 16 rounds to collect, provided you do not use Radagast, Mablung or Hirgon for extra resources or cost reduction.

The Vassal does not need an extra target to ready Gwaihir, just let them attack in conjunction and Gwaihir is ready for the next round, which saves you an eagle in the next planning phase. Swift and Strong does work, if you use Elf-friend and Rivendell Bow. Heir of Mardil, Steed of the Mark and all the events can work on both Gwaihir and Boromir, if you grant them the right traits or keywords. Grima has a limit once per round, which is less frequent than Gwaihir's once per phase restriction.

But in the end it just comes down to whether you are willing or able to put a single copy of Unexpected Courage on him before you run out of eagles, which should not be too hard, at least in a multiplayer game.

Fair point -- I do now own a complete collection.  Though, even before I had completed, I was generally pretty comfortable to proxy a missing card here and there as I tinkered with builds and tried to decide on my purchasing priority for grabbing sets.  So I tend to view deck-building from the assumption of complete card pool, which is certainly not how most players approach the game, and can then often be a blind spot in my own analysis.

While +3 Stats for a 3 Cost is good, by the game's usual metric of attachment costs, my experience has suggested to me that Eagles don't need the stats, really.  They tend to have plenty of bodies on the table to handle their combat needs, and they want to chump block more than any other archetype anyways (because it powers the flock, readies Gwaihir, and in the case of sacrificing Meneldor/Descendant can deal with the Staging area, too).  After they do this a few times, they've got a big beefy flock to handle most defensive needs (especially since you can use Radagast's Staff to have a 5+/5+ flock defend and/or attack twice a round). Even if the Eagles had a 5-Cost +12/+12 attachment for Gwaihir, I'm not sure I'd run it other than as a maybe "cool factor," because, as absurdly a good deal as it would be, I'd think in about 9 quests out of 10 it'd be a surplus of stats you don't need most rounds.

Now, I suppose one caveat is that although I've played a lot of Eagles, I've only managed to play the first three Cycles and about half of the LotR Saga campaign so far.  Maybe in many of the later quests there's more cause for big concentrated SotE Stats that justifies inclusion despite the cost/space issue of running the card, of course.  I can really only speak to my impressions of it based on my own experiences to this point.

I definitely like SotE for the defensive boost mostly, because 3 def with 4 htps just isnt enough in modern quests for a hero to last long. EotMM can defend for more but Gwaihir has sentinel.... Which makes me wonder. Do you play mostly as a solo player or multiplayer?

Here are my thoughts:

1. Gwahir is a better Multiplayer hero Then true solo, which is unfortunate but we have other heroes like that.

2. His negative wasn’t needed, it’s pretty harsh again for and honestly would have better balanced him out. Especially for true solo, if there are multiple eagle decks flying around in multiplayer he will be readying lots but more than likely in solo he will require more effort to run smoothly (kind of like Saruman).

3. Support of the Eagles is amazing, I used it on Boromir when I only had the first cycle and sagas and that’s what let us get through the sagas combat-wise. There may be better card slots these days in an Eagles deck but it definitely has its place especially when you can get it for free or in multiplayer.

4. We haven’t seen the final pack yet so maybe there is something to help his negative like many of the other heroes with negatives have. We can hope.

5. Lastly, Gwahir makes a decent Grey Wanderer with his epic stats and the contract’s built in readying. Also he pairs great with the heroes that ready another character like Frodo/Legolas.

Not everyone proxies cards; I don't do it myself except with damaged cards.  And as it's out-of-sphere, you need a partner deck to have access to UC at all.  But even with a willingness to proxy and other decks to find UC, there still remains the other problem -- there are a lot of heroes who do something more interesting with their exhaustion than Gwaihir can.  Support of the Eagles has the same problem, as powerful as it get to be, it's also powerful on other ranged tactics heroes or other ranged sentinel heroes, or even someone like Boromir who has neither ranged nor sentinel (without assistance) but can guarantee two exhaustions in the combat phase.

Yes, if you draw all your eagles, spread them out, and have the ones that like to leave play leave play you could ready Gwaihir 33 times.  But drawing and playing all your eagles is hardly guaranteed, and more to the point while this is good for *Gwaihir*, it's not actually good for Eagles!  In a more normal Eagle deck, you don't want your Guardians and Vassals to leave play until they can buff Misty, and you *do* typically want to get most Eagles in play ASAP, not dribble them out when Gwaihir needs a ready.  Once again, if Gwaihir readied normally like any other hero, he could get some "free" readying from things that eagles like to do anyway, but pushing Gwaihir's readying requirement on the backs of the poor Eagles forces them to play abnormally.  You will also be including cards like Meneldor's Flight and Born Aloft that often don't make the cut in a Gwaihir-free Eagles deck.  Eagles are good [required] for Gwaihir -- I don't see Gwaihir as being good for Eagles.  Imagine if Celeborn didn't buff Silvans, but had great stats and readied only when a Silvan entered or left play.  Could he ready a lot?  Normally, yes.  But would he be good for a Silvan deck?  Not hardly.

It's a good point that a post-attack readying *is* good for Gwaihir, unlike most heroes in the game, because it can substitute for the missing end-of-turn ready.  At long last, we've finally got a natural partner for Tactics Brand in another deck.

Yes, if you use trait-fixing you can expand the options for both Boromir and Gwaihir, but when hero A can use a readying effect without trait-fixing and the other cannot, it's fair to give the advantage to the hero who doesn't need a three-card-combo to take advantage of Swift & Strong.  Repeatable readying via attachment is much more interesting, and the only one Gwaihir can add via trait-fixing is Heir of Mardil (and even with adding Noble, Boromir still has the advantage with Heir triggering due to the LeDenethor combo).  Throwing trait-fixing in also gives Boromir access to Snowmane and Armored Destrier, neither of which can be used by Gwaihir.

Grima can be used only once per round, to get multiple Doomed readies Saruman will have to fall back on the 11 different Doomed events he can use to ready, all but one of which is zero cost, and all but one can be played in any action window.  Not that you'd *want* to do that since his staff can only negate one Doomed per turn -- the Saruman comparison was about *ways* to ready, not how many times a hero would ready in a typical round.  I'd guess the hero with the highest number of average readies in actual play is Sam due to his ability, usefulness in every-phase, and access to Fast Hitch.  Gwaihir won't change that.  Here's the significance of the Eagles timing breakdown:

Wilyador and Eagles played in planning can substitute for the missing end-of-turn refresh.

LeFrodo can ready Gwaihir, but only if Gwaihir exhausted to quest.

SpLegolas or Hirgon-eagle-playing or Eagle Emissary leaving play can ready Gwaihir before the combat phase

Chumping or LeGimli or WG going away can ready Gwaihir after a defense has been made

Vassal, TaBrand, TaMerry can ready Gwaihir after an attack can be made.

You can opportunistically insert other readies with Born Aloft/Meneldor's flight.

Of these effects, only hero effects are inherently repeatable, though playing eagles in planning is *likely* for much of a given quest.  Assume that Gwaihir is ready after the planning phase due to played eagles and/or TaBrand/TaMerry readying.  What does Gwaihir need to get actual action advantage?

Quest/combat -- repeatable with LeFrodo, SpLegolas, Hirgon (will drainEagles out of hand faster), or once per Eagle Emissary

Defense/Defense -- repeatable with LeGimli or once per WG or eagle chumped -- but in all cases requires a defense *between* Gwaihir's own defenses.  Even with natural sentinel and Support of the Eagles, you need three defenses in order to defend with Gwaihir twice.

Defense/Attack -- repeatable with LeGimli, TaBrand, or once per WG or Vassal or eagle chumped.  A bit wider than the defense/defense combo, but you still need either a defense or an attack *between* Gwaihir's defense and Gwaihir's attack.

Attack/Attack -- repeatable with TaMerry, TaBrand, or once per Vassal.  This scenario does not require an in-between attack, as TaMerry and TaBrand and the Vassal can attack *with* Gwaihir and ready him immediately.  As a bonus, if there's not another target he's already ready for the next round.  The down side is that the natural Eagles-readying is only one cheap ally; for repeatable readying, you need to be attacking with TaMerry or with TaBrand in another deck.

Gwaihir is a combat hero, he has excellent stats and both ranged and sentinel.  But his readying *inside* the combat phase is badly timed, he has to skip a defense in order to defend twice, and has to skip a defense or attack in order to both defend and attack.  For a hero who has so many ways to ready, getting *useful* action advantage isn't as easy as it looks.  Obviously, the more players at the table, the less crippling the skip-a-combat requirement will be and the more slots will be available elsewhere to make room for LeGimli or TaBrand.

The problem I see with Grey Wanderer Gwaihir is that his Eagles need resources, and if you're providing resources with the contract you're not using his contract to ready.  So I don't think you'd enjoy much action advantage with Gwaihir and would have to use the contract every turn just to get him to ready at all.

Of the other-hero-readiers, I think LeFrodo is by far the weakest.  Since Gwaihir has to quest with him, he can't ready Gwaihir if he's already exhausted, and it also requires questing successfully.

SpLegolas is the second weakest, not just because a card is typically more costly than a resource, but because the only action advantage he enables is quest/combat, and with only 2 willpower for Gwaihir it's not *that* special.  Still, Legolas can ready a Gwaihir who wasn't readied in planning, so he's a great option to have around.

LeGimli I like a lot, since any enemy Gimli defends Gwaihir will be able to attack.  He's also the only hero-readier who can allow defense/defense from Gwaihir, though that requires three enemies to defend against.

TaMerry is the lone hero-readier who is a good fit in Gwaihir's own deck, he provides tactic resources for Eagles, he's low-threat so helps with Gwaihir's huge threat, and he can consistently attack with Gwaihir to either enable another attack or ready Gwaihir for next turn.  His weakness is that the requirement to attack *with* Gwaihir means he can't set up defend/attack action advantage.  Downside is that Merry's attack won't be bolstered by Gwaihir, and the other tactics hobbit hero wants hobbits in the deck, not eagles.

TaBrand is the lone hero who can set up defense/attack action advantage, though that requires him to be able to destroy an enemy engaged with Gwaihir's deck and without Gwaihir's help.  He can set up attack/attack though, and like Merry can leave Gwaihir ready.  And like Merry, his readying is "free" instead of costing a resource or card.

For maximum Gwaihir potential, he wants to be in a fellowship with all of these guys....

Grey Wanderer lets you choose 2 options at once, so you can ready and get resources. The timing problems with doing that on round 1 apply to Gwaihir as well as any other hero, but starting from round 2 Gwaihir actually makes very good use of both the readying and the resources during the planning phase--- he doesn't have to intentionally time his use of the contract to make full use of it.

Haha beat me to the explanation, you get to choose two options, often the readying/healing are wasted since you want the resources during planning most rounds. And with stats like a boss/support of the Eagles you usually wont need healing. All of the secrecy cards to get more resources and summoning high cost allies is great with Eagles. And you could even throw in all the copies of ally Radagast in hopes that you’ll get him for free for some more help with Eagles.
With Gwahir you will always be able to use the readying and resources every round. I think he is arguably one of the best heroes for that contract. Haldir and Treebeard are two other solid choices though, but until we see the final cards from the pack, solo Gwahir is looking like the way to play our winged friend.

I agree that a Wandering-Gwaihir is a tantalizing option, and I tinkered with it initially a bit, but I think it has some notable limitations:

 * First and foremost, he auto-loses any quests which require carrying Restricted objective items (which is, especially early on, a fair amount of quests), so you're forced to only play him in multi-player where other players' heroes can try and carry all the restricted objectives for you 
 * In a similar vein, he cannot start with the One Ring + Master Card, which is a potent boon to other Wanderers as it thins their deck and gives them access to the Master cards
 * At already 13 Threat (and with the Contract costing 1 threat to use each turn), Gwaihir is not in secrecy long, which means he's got a very narrow window to use Secrecy Cards (and has a hard time getting access to Threat Reduction).  It also means you can't really use Doom cards like Deep Knowledge or a Timely Aid --> OHUH Gandalf quite as well as other Wanderers.  Also, at only 2WP, even with Strider there are many quests where Gwaihir may come up short in WP against the initial starting Staging Area threat, and if he raises his threat from failed questing on Turn 1 he might be out of Secrecy very quickly.
 * Tactics is (arguably) the worst sphere for a Wanderer (card draw from Lore, Resource Acceleration or Ally Acceleration (Timely Aids , Sneaks, etc) from Leadership, Cancellation Protection from Spirit).  Not having cancellation protection is especially painful (since you can't even One Ring + The Master Ring like other Wanderers), and a lot of treacheries go from painful to "you lose" when you are a Gray Wanderer, especially solo.
    

That said, a lone Gwaihir just flying round is super thematic and a lot of fun, depending greatly on the particular quest/fellowship.  If nothing else, it's finally a reason to use Ally Radagast, which is awesome in and of itself!  I will likely return to trying to get a Gray Wander Gwaihir to work someday, but in the meantime I've settled on other heroes for when I want to Wander.

While the restricted restriction does make it harder, it’s not an auto-loss impossible, sword-thain can let you turn a unique ally into a hero to grab it, and is possible with a bit of setup. Harder for sure but I mean we are using Treebeard as a wanderer.

 

He also can’t take the master ring which is a big negative so I’ll give you that. 

 

The no threat reduction isn’t really a concern, the first non-unique card each round you can play off-sphere so after a few rounds you can drop a Galadhrim’s Greeting or Gandalf (the latter would be great with Gwahir’s Debt and ally Radagast that you’d be trying to play anyways!)

 

And while 4 willpower is a bit short I find that 3-5 is a decent start for most average decks. Not everyone can mono-Tactics Boromir, Theoden and Eowyn quest at 10 starting round. 

 

And final point tactics is easily the hardest to play true solo anyways so the added challenge is something to note but in my mind to embrace especially for the aspect of the awesome theme you pointed out.

I don't proxy cards either, unless they require an errata. UC is out of sphere for Gwaihir, yes, but that does not mean, I need a partner deck to include it. I happen to like tactic/spirit decks (paired with lore/leadership). Are you mostly playing one-handed solo mono-sphere?

My first target for UC is usually the defender and Gwaihir happens to be one. And while there are heroes with fancy actions that require an exhaustion, not all of them need UC. They either need better stats than Gwaihir, an exhaustive ability, which can be used multiple times, or a combination of both. So let's see, who might qualify:

Dori needs someone else to defend in the first place, so he is not a primary candidate for UC.
Galadriel's ability has a limit, though through Nenya or her Mirror she can exhaust a second time. But without her toys there is no need for UC yet. The same goes for Elrond with Vilya and Círdan or Gandalf with Narya.
Denethor has some nice encounter deck manipulation and depending on the quest, he can greatly benefit from UC.
All other exhaustive abilities are either limit once per round or responses to revealing cards.
Merry, Eleanor, Fatty Bolger, Argalad and Beravor have worse stats than Gwaihir and thus have no higher need of UC than him. This only leaves Haldir of Lórien, as long as he has increased his attack.

In most quests there is no demand to ready a hero based on willpower alone, so they need a combat stat that is higher than Gwaihir's. For attack, without any weapons there are only Beorn, who cannot have attachments, Gimli with at least 3 damage on him, Na'asiyah with a pile of resources, Bard the Bowman against non-immune enemies not engaged with him, Grimbeorn the Old against non-immune enemies and a pile of resources, Faramir with 3 enemies in the staging area and Treebeard when self-damaging. Éowyn might use UC with her ability to attack for 10 twice, but that would make the card pretty useless afterwards.
For defense without any armour there are only Beregond, Na'asiyah with a pile of resources and Spirit Dain Ironfoot when discarding a card. Erkenbrand does not have more defense but innate shadow protection when self-damaging. Leadership Dáin wants to be ready after defending, but only has one hitpoint more.

Most of the heroes mentioned above need a keyword, healing to compensate for their abilities, attachments or resources to surpass Gwaihir in combat, so they need some extra combo pieces, which are about as hard to find as UC itself.

Also Quickbeam and Saruman I guess.

I only included heroes with better inherent stats than Gwaihir: Quickbeam and Saruman are also 4 attack, but lack ranged.

> Dori needs someone else to defend in the first place, so he is not a primary candidate for UC.
> Galadriel's ability has a limit, though through Nenya or her Mirror she can exhaust a second time. But without her toys there is no need for UC yet. The same goes for Elrond with Vilya and Círdan or Gandalf with Narya.
> Denethor has some nice encounter deck manipulation and depending on the quest, he can greatly benefit from UC.
> All other exhaustive abilities are either limit once per round or responses to revealing cards.
> Merry, Eleanor, Fatty Bolger, Argalad and Beravor have worse stats than Gwaihir and thus have no higher need of UC than him. This only leaves Haldir of Lórien, as long as he has increased his attack.
> 
> In most quests there is no demand to ready a hero based on willpower alone, so they need a combat stat that is higher than Gwaihir's. For attack, without any weapons there are only Beorn, who cannot have attachments, Gimli with at least 3 damage on him, Na'asiyah with a pile of resources, Bard the Bowman against non-immune enemies not engaged with him, Grimbeorn the Old against non-immune enemies and a pile of resources, Faramir with 3 enemies in the staging area and Treebeard when self-damaging. Éowyn might use UC with her ability to attack for 10 twice, but that would make the card pretty useless afterwards.
> For defense without any armour there are only Beregond, Na'asiyah with a pile of resources and Spirit Dain Ironfoot when discarding a card. Erkenbrand does not have more defense but innate shadow protection when self-damaging. Leadership Dáin wants to be ready after defending, but only has one hitpoint more.

My most experience with Eagles is actually playing a progression descendant of Beorn's Path spirit/tactics deck (Thalin/TaGimli/SpEowyn), which was an Eagles deck in Dwarrowdelf/Hobbit/Numenor/Ringmaker -- I phased out the Eagles completely only when I got to Derndingle.  A solo Eagles deck with double tactics is totally viable, especially with all spheres having some good questing heroes now.  And though the threat hit would be high, I think Eowyn/Gwaihir/Gimli would certainly be viable, since outside of cycles with 1-hp enemies Gwaihir has more potential, and when one of the two UC shows up I'd put it on Gwaihir over Gimli so I could guarantee he is ready and could defend.

That's not to say the deck wouldn't be better if I swapped out Gwaihir for Grimbeorn or TaBeregond or TaBoromir or Mablung (or any tactics hero that can defend four 4+ with a single Gondorian Shield), and every last one of those guys is lower threat than Gwaihir.  The deck's not especially good for Gwaihir -- with splash spirit there are spirit cards I want/need to include, not just my 1-3 copies of UC, and that deck space has to come from somewhere.  Gwaihir wants to be in a deck with all the eagles, plus three copies each of Born Aloft and Meneldor's Flight.  That's hard to justify in an Eagles deck, so I see Gwaihir's natural home as a full-blown kitchen sink Eagles deck, and that means mono-tactics is the way to go.  You can also have a big Eagles deck combining double tactics with Gandalf, Elrond, or especially Radagast, but those guys have toys that demand deck space too, and they're all to my mind more attractive UC targets than Gwaihir anyway.

As you say, Gwaihir's best potential is as the defender, and I agree the best target for UC is a heroic defender, barring exhausting abilities you want to use elsewhere.  Gwaihir has great defensive bones, but even aside from his readying issues, he's hampered by having natural access only to Support of the Eagles, which is both expensive and needs WG or buffed Misty in play for defense -- and that works equally well on any *other* tactics defender (or for splashers in an Eagles deck, Song of Battle -- I'd add that to my Radagast Eagles deck both to help pay non-Eagle tactics cards and to make him a Support target, because the only thing better than a heroic defender with Support is a heroic defender with Support *and* A Burning Brand).  But the other thing that hampers him is that his "natural" readying is rarely between defenses, only with WG leaving play, [or LeGimli readying him].  So a *ready* Gwaihir with UC attached is only good for two defenses, same as any other defender with UC, with Gwaihir having the handicap that you can't *guarantee* he's ready in the first place without exhausting UC.

Without sphere-fixing, Support can only go on Tactics heroes (including Gandalf if he plays it himself).  But it doesn't have to go in the Eagles deck, nothing requires it to choose an eagle you control.  So whether part of the Eagles deck or not, all tactics heroes can take it.  All other tactics heroes except Quickbeam (and Beorn, who can't use support either) can take 1-2 of the *many* restricted armors that boost defense in addition to Support.  This is another hard obstacle for Gwaihir, though he has a trump card that someone like TaBeregond can't match -- if there's only *one* defense needed, he is powerful on the attack.  Still, in a multiplayer situation where I expect multiple defenses to be common, which of the defensive-potential Tactics would I pass over as a Support/UC target?  Gwaihir is a 3/4 defender.

Gandalf is a special case since he has to play Support himself, but he's a *much* better UC target since he can quest better, use Narya or Word of Command, and with Shadowfax gets an extra ready plus ranged/sentinel.  He can also play ABB on himself.  He starts at 3/5.  Definitely would prefer Gandalf.

Boromir is 2/5 and neither ranged nor sentinel, but he starts with guaranteed readying (sadly nerfed to once per phase), gets to 4/5 with 1-cost Gondorian Shield, can naturally take Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire.  Despite the lack of sentinel and ranged, I'm definitely buffing SuperBoromir over Gwaihir.

Beregond is 4/4, and 6/4 with a free Gondorian Shield and also sentinel.  If you're looking for multiplayer sentinel defense, it doesn't get any better than Beregond.

Theoden is only 2/4, but he's sentinel already, can attack for three, and is boosted by 3 for both Goldien Shield and Herugrim (sadly, only one each).  Much easier to boost his defense, I'd prefer him as a target.

Mablung is only 2/4 but deserves mention because he's often an Eagles deck staple for his resource generation.  Natural access to G. Shield is good, as is Blood/Fire *on a hero that generates resources*.  Lack of sentinel diminishes his potential, but I think his upside is greater than Gwaihir in the same deck.

Dori is 2/5 and sentinel, so Gwaihir starts with a point of defense on him as a repeat defender, though lacking a hit point.  But Dori can take many defensive boosts that Gwaihir can't, and he has the unique ability among heroic defenders to help provide heroic defense safely *even when at the point of death*.  I've played a ton of Dori fellowships and UC doesn't generally go on Dori (the one Dori fellowship that used an Eagles deck had TaTheoden/Dori/TaAragorn), but if the only two targets for Support/UC to set up a heroic defender were Dori and Gwaihir, I'd go with Dori -- his defensive potential is higher due to Restricted access.

Na'asiyah is 2/4, but can be 4/4 by spending a resource.  She lacks sentinel (or ranged) but her defensive potential is higher and her starting attack with buff matches Gwaihir.  Not a good fit for an Eagles deck because she can't pay for allies.

Tom Cotton is 3/3 and lacks sentinel.  But if you're going to set up an inpenetrable multi-defender with Support of the Eagles, you can't do better than a Hobbit with access to Fast Hitch.  Support works for the *whole round*, so all you need is Arwen and Bob's your uncle.  Since he synergizes with Hobbits he's unlikely in an Eagles deck, but that's no impediment to Support and he's a fine tactics splash in a Hobbit deck.

Grimbeorn is 3/5 sentinel and can counterattck for effective-five.  Absolutely no contest here, Grimbeorn is *vastly* better as a Support/UC choice.

Amongst the other tactics hero, Aragorn, Legolas, Bard, Thorin and Merry all have when-attacks abilities that would be handy to trigger more than once in a round, so are attractive UC/Support targets.  Elladan has unlimited (until the resources run out) attacks, so synergizes *extremely* well with Support if you've got enemies to kill.

Once you get away from tactics Support needs sphere-fixing, but there's a lot of sentinel defenders who can buff their defense more easily than Gwaihir, plus  Beravor, Galadriel, Elrond with Vilya, Cirdan with Narya, Argalad and Denethor with useful stats and exhausting abilities.  The more players at the table, the more likely it is that *somebody* will benefit more from UC being attached to them than Gwaihir will.  Gwaihir benefits a lot from UC, both from guaranteeing he will be ready at least once a round and to ready him in windows (like between consecutive defense) where Eagles won't.  But Gwaihir having the greatest need for UC doesn't translate into UC necessarily being most valuable on him.

Gwaihir's combat stats are excellent, and it's true that most heroes need combo pieces to surpass him -- but when they get those pieces, surpass him they will.  Whether the other pieces are hit quicker or slower than UC/Support doesn't matter much, because those two cards can be used to great advantage on other heroes as well; there is *no* attachment or event I can think of which benefits Gwaihir and none of his competition.  But I think the combo pieces will be hit sooner to buff defense, since heroic defenders or attackers typically have *multiple* attachments to boost their stats, not just relying on a single 3x, and Open the Armory makes them easier to find than other cards in the deck.  By the time UC shows up, Gwaihir may not have the best combat stats, and long-term he certainly won't keep them.  Replacing sentinel/ranged is a tougher task, though depending on how combat capable the other decks are -- and how often the quest can keep enemies away from the combat deck -- this may not be such a big deal even with multiple players.

Again you put Gwaihir in a solo context, while I see him as a fellowship hero. But even in a solo Tactics/Spirit deck with UC, I am no longer reliant on his response to ready at all. In such a deck you could pack Winged Guardian, The Eagles are Coming, Landroval, Descendant of Thorondor, Vassal of the Windlord, Eagles of the Misty Mountains, Support of the Eagles, Meneldor, Flight of the Eagles, Eagle Emissary and Wilyador. That is at most 33 cards out of 50, or 2 thirds of your deck with 2 thirds of your heroes being Tactics, which is what I would strive for. Of course you do not need 3 copies of each card, so you can include Born Aloft, Flight of Meneldor or Feint.

If you want to combine double tactics with Radagast in a solo deck, UC has no sphere match. For Elrond you need Vilya first and then the question is, whether you need more willpower, attack or A Burning Brand. For Gandalf the question is similar, but both heroes have special attachments for action advantage (Light of Valinor and Shadowfax) and thus less need for UC.

I did not say, that Gwaihir's best potential is as a defender. I said, that I prefer UC primarily on defenders and Gwaihir is one (due to sentinel and 3/4). But with 4 attack he can also succesfully be used as an attacker if needed.

I would not waste a Winged Guardian to ready Gwaihir as long as I have access to cheaper Vassals or one of the eagles with leave play effects. And there still are Flight of the Eagles, Meneldor's Flight and Born Aloft to ready him between defenses.

With Leadership in the mix he has access to Dúnedain Warning, within Lore there is Protector of Lórien. And as long there is no new FAQ also A Burning Brand with Song of Wisdom.

"Many" restricted armors that boost defense are not available for all other tactics heroes except Quickbeam and Beorn: Most of them have trait requirements with only Round Shield (conditional) and Gondorian Shield available to everyone. But then do you really need more than 7 defense in most cases? And if you do, there is still time for taking some damage or a eagle chump blocker, which can ready Gwaihir.

Shadowfax is an argument against UC on Gandalf, as it does the same, just better.

Gondorian Fire and Blood of Númenor can be slapped on anyone with Steward of Gondor, which you most likely will use to pay for these effects. And while Boromir has lower threat than Gwaihir, it will not last long with his ability.

Sure, Beregond is the best defender in the game, but he also is a one trick pony. Gwaihir can also quest and attack, if the situation calls for it.

Théoden does have his toys, but you have to find them first, they work only once per round (as you already said), he is not ranged and does not ready as easily as Gwaihir in the combat phase.

Dori has less defense than Gwaihir, which itself is a bad thing. You need defensive attachments on him, otherwise he will die faster than Gwaihir. And before I put any defensive attachments on Dori, I put them on the main defender in the first place. And again Gwaihir can reach 7 defense with Support and a Winged Guardian, you will need 2 restricted attachments on Dori in addition to Support to surpass that (he is neither Gondor nor Noble). At least the other heroes on this list do not need extra defense buffs.

You already said enough about Na'asiyah: She does some things better than Gwaihir and others worse.

Tom Cotton does not have any keywords, less hitpoints, less attack and needs attachments to ready in the combat phase while Gwaihir has the potential to do so while another eagle does something useful like buffing EotMM, nuking the staging area or shuffling an eagle into the encounter deck. And with a lot of attachments, I can turn most heroes into a super defender.

Grimbeorn with UC soaks a lot of resources, so he also needs resource acceleration and then he will not contribute playing the eagle allies.

The other tactics heroes you mention all have their merits, but this time they cannot defend if necessary. Gwaihir has the flexibility to do both as needed.

As I said before, Galadriel and Círdan need their rings (or mirror) first to get any use out of UC, Gwaihir does so from the start. Beravor has a useful though limited ability, but as none of her stats is higher than Gwaihir's she is not a better target. Denethor's ability can be useful, but it depends on the circumstances whether it is better than 4 attack or 2 willpower. Argalad's stat also are not better than Gwaihir's and his ability is limited to once per round.

As I said above, many heroes can be better with enough attachments, but there is a point, where higher attack or defense just does not help you any longer, as you cannot overkill or overdefend your enemies. There are cards who benefit Gwaihir like Meneldor's Flight, which do absolutely nothing for the other heroes (except Éomer and Prince Imrahil), but they also need a lot of attachments to reach the Windlord.

True, Support of the Eagles is only 3x in a deck, but there are also other cards that work on him like signals, Arwen, Protector of Lorien and Black Arrow. And even in risk of repeating myself: 7 attack and 7 defense surely are not the highest stats reachable in the game, but they are more than sufficient for most situations.

I'm not sure why you say I'm putting Gwaihir in a solo context, I've pointed out sentinel/ranged, mentioned multiplayer repeatedly, and I see Gwaihir's natural home as a mono-tactics Eagles deck, which are typically not solo.  Gwaihir's clearly better in a multiplayer context, he can get non-restricted buffs from other spheres and his sentinel/ranged can help cover enemies that escape the Eagles deck -- the most powerful Eagle has neither trait, only the one-shot Vassals and temporary Wilyador have ranged, and WG is the only viable sentinel option (Landroval also has it, but with 1 defense is a terrible repeat defender).  But I've found at least in my fellowship play that a hero defender lacking sentinel (especially early) is often *not* a crippling limitation, as the combat deck engages the most enemies and the most difficult enemies.  That's quest-dependent, but given a choice between two lockdown defenders, one of which has sentinel and the other of which can defend twice consecutively, I'll take the latter every time.  I find ranged on a hero much less important than sentinel; there's a wealth of inexpensive ranged attackers, and they can be combined to take things down.

Of the 11 cards you mentioned in the hypothetical Spirit/Tactics deck with Gwaihir, I think you want 3x of all of them with the exception of Landroval (1x), maybe Thorondor (2x), and if solo you can drop the unpredictable Flight of the Eagles.  So 27-30 cards before adding in Born Aloft and Meneldor's Flight, two cards that in a normal Eagles deck (especially not mono-tactics) often don't make the cut -- and with Gwaihir, you *want* 3x of both of those cards, not just to exploit Meneldor and Thorondor but to ready Gwaihir at an opportune moment.  Now you're up to 33-36 Eagles cards before adding a single spirit card in a spirit splash deck!  There's little room left for Feint and other fantastic TActics card.  There's little for Radagast and his staff, which is worth considering in a normal splash Eagles deck.  You also haven't added 3x Gwaihir's Debt yet (the ONE Eagles card actually made better by having Gwaihir hero in play), which wants ally Radagast in play *and* wants 3x Gandalf too.

Radagast as a lore splash is the natural off-tactics for an Eagles deck.  He doesn't have access to UC, but he is going to want his staff (3x) and Wizard Pipe, and Gwaihir's Debt, and 3x core Gandalf, and Messenger Ravens -- add those on top of the 33-36 cards Gwaihir's need, and there's no room for other Lore or Tactics cards.  A lot of heroes have toys that will eat into your deck space if you choose them -- Gwaihir needs over 30 cards to support his needs.  That's why I see him as ill-fitting anywhere but mono-tactics, at least in a three-hero deck.

It's absolutely true that with enough attachments you can turn any hero into a super defender, and with an Eagles deck Support can turn any tactics hero into a strong defender *and* attacker.  That's why the most important attribute in a super defender is *ability to ready*, and that's where Tom Cotton shines if he's at the same table with a Lore deck containing 3x Fast Hitch.  Yes, he needs Fast Hitch to get a readying advantage over Gwaihir, but once he has it attachment he can defend consecutively every turn, and the more copies he gets the more he can defend.  For Gwaihir to defend consecutive he can remove an Eagle from play to do something useful, but it costs a card (the event), board state (Eagle removed from play), and will need more resources to put the Eagle *back* into play.  It's *vastly* more expensive readying and it's not repeatable.  Eagles leaving play sacrifices board state and/or cards.  Gwaihir does nothing to provide card draw, but needs it badly, and his deck space demands and difficulty in getting weapons to exhaust preclude the few card draw options in Tactics.

This is also why Gwaihir can't compare with Grimbeorn.  Yes, repeat Grimbeorn will suck resources, but you won't always need to use his counterattack, and burning one resource for a counterattack is vastly cheaper than removing and replaying Eagles to keep Gwaihir readying!

It's true that Gondorian Shield and Round Shield are the only armors that can go on all those tactics heroes, but that's not my point -- each of those heroes based on traits has buffs that can go *on them* that Gwaihir doesn't have access to, while Gwaihir has access to *nothing* restricted and nothing non-restricted that wants any trait but sentinel or ranged.  Dori starts with one less defense than Gwaihir?  He also can take Gondorian Shield *or* Ring Mail, and other decks can give him Armor of Erebor or Dwarven Shield.  Tom Cotton starts at the same defense but can get G. Shield or Ring Mail, plus the non-restricted Hobbit Cloak.  Grimbeorn can get the wonderful Raiment of War, Captain of Gondor *and* Hauberk of Mail on him at the same time.

I don't agree with the logic that Shadowfax's readying means that Gandalf shouldn't be a UC target.  Getting Shadowfax makes Gandalf a *better* UC target, because you want to buff the hero that can ready *most often* -- plus it gives him both Ranged and Sentinel, matching Gwaihir's one big advantage. In addition, Gandalf has a repeatable exhaust-ability with Narya and a non-repeatable exhaust ability with Word of Command.  And he's a better quester too.  There's no possible way I'd waste UC on Gwaihir if Gandalf is at the table with Shadowfax on him.

Yes, UC is not useful on Galadriel if Nenya hasn't come out yet.  But being able to use both Nenya and Galadriel's ability is so useful that there's no way I'd put UC on Gwaihir over Galadriel just because Nenya's not out yet!  It's not transferrable.

The same is true to a lesser extent of Cirdan, though unlike Galadriel he can actually attack and defend.

I do put defensive attachments on the "main hero" before Dori, UC included -- but that assumes that there is a "main hero" to buff.  In a number of fellowships there never was a "main defender" and who Dori would end up buffing would vary.  For example, in our saga playthrough Dori's deck had Amarthiul, but any enemies engaging with the spirit deck would be covered by Dori directly early on, and later Arwen (with Light of Valinor) or Eowyn (with Snowmane/Golden Shield).  In another fellowship Dori would help out Beravor or Elanor as the situation demanded.  When Dori is being "spread around", it makes sense to buff Dori first; if you have Dwarven defensive attachments they only go on Dori, if you use Dunedain Warning starting it on Dori can let you get double duty on an assisted defense (boost Dori's defense when exhausting, then move it to the defending hero before the attack is resolved).

But if Dori's the intended Support target, you want buffs on him from the beginning, because once he gets that he is the tower.  And once he gets that, he's a fine attacker in his own right as well, making UC useful with only one defense needed -- that's the thing about Support of the Eagles, even though Gwaihir has the advantager over everyone if being used for both defense and attack to start with, once a hero has Support they *all* attack and defend well.

Blood/Fire can be slapped on anyone with Steward of Gondor, but Mablung is of special interest in that he generates resources *without* Steward and he doesn't need Steward to get it.  If Steward is shy (and for a 1x core player it's only a 2x core) Blood/Fire cards are dead if you don't have a natural target.  Steward is also such a useful target that you may have a better use for it than creating a Blood/Fire target.

Argalad's ability is once-per round, but he's a ranged attacker and his ability means you want to boost his attack ASAP so he can cause direct damage.  If there's an enemy in staging to use his ability on during the questing phase, it's reasonably likely there will be an enemy for him to attack in the combat phase; UC is a consistently useful card on him.  I'm not sure I'd put UC on Argalad over Gwaihir, since buffing him to 3 defense is still shy of Gwaihir but sufficient to cover most enemies.  But if his weapons came out before UC did, I'd give it strong consideration.

Unexpected Courage is a fantastic card on Gwaihir, it can guarantee that he's ready for the combat phase and most of the time it will let him take two consecutive exhaustions in the combat phase.  But like the Eagles themselves, Gwaihir needs UC more than it needs him -- UC is a fantastic card on a *lot* of heroes, and there's a lot of tactics hero that I would rather put Support/UC on than Gwaihir, because they bring something else to the table I value more than the sentinel/ranged combo and unreliable, board-state damaging readying.

Has anyone state side been able to get their hands on the pack? It's now august and they haven't updated the upcoming page to reflect a release date. I haven't preordered it yet so I am wondering if people have received any word from third party retailers.

I think it’s available now.

I live in the states. I preordered it months ago and it has been in pre-shipping since August 3rd (not picked up by the shipper yet). Normally they ship through the Postal Service, but this time it looks like UPS Mail Innovations? Been chomping at the bit since being notified Monday that it was shipping and it looks like it still hasn’t shipped. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Still not available in Canada

Just got the call from my FLGS that my copy arrived today (USA).

It should arrive around this time. I got mine a few days ago (NL based), but I don't think the official release of this pack was delayed like Under the Ash Mountains was. But I have heard that some people had trouble with their shipping, so perhaps the packs will be delayed a little based on local post offices.

My FLGS (Midwest USA) also received their copies on Friday.

Now September 2020 and "Land of Sorrow" still not released anywhere in Canada.

Have had FLGS (Toronto) pre-order paid for a while, but no information can be found as to what the hold up is. All other recent FFG LCG products appear to be showing up in Canada on the announced release dates.

I see it still available as a pre-order here in Quebec, so it should be released soon.

I just ordered mine from the states on Amazon. Costed an extra $10 but I’ve also been enjoying Gwahir and my MOTK decks for a week already.

You're a LOTR LCG player in Toronto?

 

I also pre ordered in Toronto (haven't gotten anything yet).  If you're local in Toronto we should meet up some time to play!

I'm in Calgary, but pre-ordered from a Toronto store a while back. This pack hasn't materialized at any Canadian retailer yet, as far as I can tell... which is rather unusual, given that all of the other LCG releases seem to have hit the shelves in a timely fashion.

It's starting to get really frustrating.

Someone on a reddit thread suggested that the delay might have been caused by the Montreal port strike... does FFG actually ship their products to Canada by boat???

From what I've read, the various parties agreed to a 7-month truce as of August 24, 2020... so hopefully the backlog will clear up soon, if that is indeed the reason why this pack hasn't made it to Canada.

Nice to see all these Canadian players here. I’m in Fort McMurray, Alberta and have a few groups we play with here.

Well Canadian players, this is the reply I got from a Toronto-based retailer who was kind enough to look into the Land of Sorrow distribution delays up here:

"Apologies for the inconvenience, unfortunately we would not have too much information in regards to the lengthy delays of Land of Sorrow. We are told by our distributor, that simply because of manufacturing issues due to COVID-19, that the product has been delayed and when pressed about how, as you have mentioned, the US has received their copies ahead all the way back in August, we were just that unfortunately suppliers/manufacturers are different for US and Canada and that it is just the Canadian locations having issues. Sadly that is all the information that we have."

I cancelled and ordered the US, I was a little concerned with the game winding down that the final packs wouldn't see a reprint and it would a single printing (similar to some other LCGs which have concluded at this point).

I'm a bit worried about getting everything game has to offer before it ends as well. Couldn't find any modern packs online. Ordered the bunch of odler ones that I could find and didn't have. Having my fingers crossed I'll be able to get Smeagol and Saruman at the very least.

I did the same thing.

And I'm worried I'm going to have to do it Fortress of Nurn, as well. How is that the other FFG LCG titles make it to Canadian retailers, but not the last couple of LotR packs? It's mind boggling.

 

EDIT: My Land of Sorrows pack has been stuck in Newark, NJ, since September 22. And it has to be routed via Sweden before coming back to Canada. These logistical chains just seem so counter intuitive.

Yeah I did the same for the final pack from miniature market, just crazy that other things are released in Canada but just not our game.
