# [Is the Arkham Horror LCG the end of LotR LCG?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/)

## 1 [JsBingley on May 20, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2226224)

Arkham Horror LCG is also a coop LCG.

The Star War LCG was once a coop LCG, but redesigned.

Are two coop LCGs too many for FFG?

 

Does FFG have enough designers for the upcoming LCG?

Will Nate be the designer of AH LCG?

 

Is it the end of LotR LCG?

 

The Product code of the Ruin of Belegost is MEC63, the Grey Haven is MEC47,

there're room for the dreamchasing cycle(48-53), The return of the King saga(54, 55), one deluxe(56), and one more cycle(57-62)

But the delayed previews of the dreamchasing cycle seems to show the dead end of the game.

 

I hope the AH LCG is just the line of COC LCG.

> He means Call of Cthulhu LCG.

I don't think he does, as CoC LCG is not a co-op, but dueling game. And it's also already discontinued.

 

OP, mind elaborating on that Arkham Horror LCG you're talking about?

This guy got me good. I was literally dreaming of a cooperative Lovecraftian card game, and here he goes and pretends it to be real, and then I go to search for it in google and find nothing but desperation. Thanks.

Maybe it is referred to Legend of the 5 Rings, which, indeed, will replace Call of Cthulhu LCG ?

Either way, there will be a lot more nightmare content to come...

 

And I could see myself replaying many of the scenarios even if they stopped producing content.

LOTR LCG is massively popular. If FFG quits developing this game any time in the near future, I will never buy any FFG products again, and that is a promise.

Eh, worst case scenario we just take it into our own hands and keep up a running line of semi-official fan expansions, like what Ian does with First Age. In fact, Ian or Dan or somebody would probably end up leading it.

i think this is a total troll post, but just wanted to throw it out there.  If theres only one more cycle after the current one like the OP seems to suggest, that'll still take us the next another year and a half into the future. Thats a good amount of time. 

 

cant believe this is the kind of crap i post for the first time in months for. i'll end on a positive note

 

next saga expansion looks amazing. really looking forward to the rest of this current cycle you guys. see whomever at gencon

That's four solo/co-op Cthulhu Mythos games with that, plus Mansions of Madness. No pure versus games at all. Are they that sure of L5R being great?

Man, hope that is legit...Seems like it could be cool.  I've looked pretty extensively at the various Lovecraft games that FFG makes in search of another solo game, but not of them have really clicked for me mechanics-wise.  This could be a great addition to LOTR for me.  As long as it is an addition rather than a replacement.

 

On that note...What do folks think about the possibility from a business side?  Although some would happily play both games, do you think that another solo/co-op LCG would be simply cannibalizing the market for LOTR or that there would be enough players for them to coexist?  On one hand, they support multiple competitive LCGs simultaneously, but is there as much demad to go around for coop games?  I suppose it would really depend on the sales numbers and some market research (both of which I would imagine FFG has).  Another point is that we know Five Rings is in development, so if this is real it could be a very long way out.  

 

Or everything I've said could be wrong!  Fun to speculate though...Imagine we might learn more at Gencon.

If LotR LCG is as popular as they claim, it's only natural for them to explore the market with another one co-op LCG. Then, based on the results, they'll either botch or expand it.

Conquest replaces invasion

Got2.0 replaces got 1.0

L5R replaces Cthulhu

Arkham Horror replaces...

Kind of sad, but I saw it coming. Though I'm mad that it is Arkham and not Runebound.

And I wanted a competitive Lotr game once the coop was over. I'm okay with Arkham, but Arkham nothing super exciting for me either.

I've no interest in Lovecraft, but I have no idea what percentage of LOTR players are tied to it for thematic reasons rather than it (formerly) being the only co-op LCG in existence.

 

We have more places on the map of Middle Earth unexplored than could be visited in one cycle, and some of the places we've been already could certainly stand another visit.  The only news that would ease my grief if/when the game ends its exploration of the current time and place, is if it took the opportunity to move to another time and place.  Licensing the rights to the first age would be amazing, even if politically impossible.  But even under the license that now exists, there's plenty of material outside the narrow window between Hobbit and LOTR to support many, many quests and cards.  Who wouldn't want saga expansions from the *beginning* of the third age?  Who wouldn't want to explore the Dwarf-Goblin War?  Who wouldn't want to battle Wainriders or Angmar in its prime?

Yes, I know. But it's also discontinued, so it's not a current game that FFG are still developing. They have no pure versus game anymore, just selling out what they've got left of CoC LCG so far.

Yet, it has ton of content, and if you're itching for pure Arkham universe PvP - CoC LCG is the right way to go. Also, I know many people play MoM as a pure PvP experience.

 

And guys, can we not bury LotR LCG just yet please? Release of another co-op card game may as easily be the sign of expanding the market, not the downfall of LotR. I am, personally, will be buying both games, if Arkham LCG manages to impress me that is (not to offend anyone, but I don't want to buy another mess like LotR LCG core set was, I much hope they'll refine everything like it was with AGOT2.0).

Yes, I have a back-breaking amount of CoC cards myself - it was my first LCG after all :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Judging from all the official things said by FFG there's little to no risk of LotR LCG dying just yet. It's selling better than ever - so well that they'll continue to print it long after the last box is developed. More or less paraphrasing them there.

 

The Arkham LCG is just frickin' weird with all the existing co-op games in the same series. But ****, does it sound good to me. If it's + a Cthulhu Mythos LotR-like with streamlined rules I'm in. I now basically collect every LCG except AGoT 1e, so what's the harm in another expense, right?

 

We can pretty much expect a learn to play book and a reference from now on, which I'm happy with. Some really hate it, but those complainers should be forced to read the LotR rulebook. When the tears stop they'll never complain again.

Note that in description it claims that each player controls only one hero, and players decks are built around that hero's unique skills, so we might be facing something completely different from LotR LCG.

Similar enough to LotR, but one "hero" investigator means it treads on the territory of the other Arkham Horror games. Somebody at FFG must be mixing the components of all the LCGs in a blender again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'll hold off hope, despair, and/or madness until we get an official announcement. But if we get another co-op LCG I'm 100% on board. FFG have done a really good job theme-wise with their Call of Cthulhu games, especially the more recent ones. And the focus on a single investigator instead of a team of heroes sounds like something I've wanted from LOTR for a while.

What's with the doom and gloom? Lotr LCG has been so successful that's no suprise they would eventually release another CO-OP game. Netrunner, GoT, Starwars and now Warhammer 40k LCG have all been sharing the same niche and I dare say market with no problems and Lotr can do so too. In fact if there is enough differentiation between the two, it could be a boost for both games. Anyone who thinks that Lotr LCG is going anywhere is nuts, it will keep selling and because of this it has plenty of life yet. Unlike the games you mentioned(WH:Invasion, CoC, got 1.0 doesn't count), Lotr actually sells. Edited May 23, 2016 by FetaCheese

The LotR LCG is still super popular, which hopefully keep it around for a while. It's pretty much the only FFG product that is guaranteed to be on the Boardgamegeek front page hotness list every single day. For example, right now not even Netrunner or X-Wing is on there, but LotR is.

If LotR LCG wasn't good (and I wasn't already so invested :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ), still going strong, have such an amazing community, and awesome designers who know their stuff, I would've stopped buying all FFG/Asmodee related products thanks to their recent greedy price hikes and BS online retailer policies. As much as I would love a Lovecraftian co-op LCG, I won't bother out of principle. LotR LCG or bust.

> Similar enough to LotR, but one "hero" investigator means it treads on the territory of the other Arkham Horror games. Somebody at FFG must be mixing the components of all the LCGs in a blender again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

We don't know if it is similar enough or not, we have absolutely no details about the game, aside from that obscure description from the image. And judging by that description, it is not similar, because it is built around a single hero and his abilities, which reminds me more of a runner from Androind Netrunner, rather than LotR LCG vibe. And if that's true, approach to the whole gameplay might be drastically different. How do you handle exploration and combat with a single hero? What if there are no allies? It mentions only build around his skills, there might not even be anyone else, just your hero.

We know that they have several other Arkham Horror games where you play one investigator per player.

And? As I said "aside from the obscure description from the image". And in that description, there is confirmed to be only 1 hero per player, which goes against the similarity with LotR, not towards it.

It's similar to LotR in that it's a co-op only - note the other words I wrote. I was more worried about it basically being yet another take on every other Arkham game FFG has made, in case that wasn't clear.

I just don't quite get how it can be called "similar enough to LotR". Just because it's a co-op too? Well, Game of Thrones and Netrunner are two versus card games, yet they are nothing alike. We need to see details. But, if it's indeed a gencon reveal, we'll have to wait whopping 3 months to even see it, and then around 6 month for it to get released, and then around 3 month for it to get delivered into my country.

Yep, but there's a very important reason why Netrunner is different from the other LCGs: It's been originally designed by Richard Garfield. It's _not_ an original FFG design. All LCGs designed by FFG are very similar to each other. FFG is a bit like Blizzard in that regard: They're quite good at rehashing and polishing games, but have a very hard time to come up with an original design.

If it's a fake, then it's a fake well-done, and it trolled me hard at the very least.

 

I find other FFG's LCGs distinct enough to warrant the assumption that AH LCG might be pretty different from LotR LCG. It would also be only logical to not create two products with similar gameplay but different fluff from the marketing standpoint (not while they are distributed within same timeframe).

So many things I want to say that I probably won't get to them all.

I do think there is room for more than one solo lcg. I think that FFG was surprised by the reception that LotR got and wants to see if there is more gold in the vein. LotR is still constantly being reprinted. Will still see many new players asking questions on the board, and for every one that posts, 19 more are just lurking. Look at the number of people making decks on RingsDB - I don't recognize a tenth of the names. I really don't think the game is going away anytime soon. That said, when the saga expansions run out the amount of content will probably drop. If we could supplement that content with Arkham Horror LCG I think I would be all over it. ( Assuming the game is good.)

I disagree that all of FFG's LCGs are the same except insomuch as ALL card games are the same. CoC, AGoT and Netrunner were all purchased after the fact. My opinion of course.

I hope they somehow incorporate the absolutely genius resourcing of CoC in AH.

Sorry, got called away.

 

What I wanted to finish with is the absolute accessibility of LOTR LCG.  People are picking the game up right now, four years after release, and are playing the game through in release order.  And they aren't missing a thing.  Try joining a 1v1 game 4 years after release and you will get wrecked by the experienced players.  I started playing AgoT2 as soon as it came to my store and got second in our first store tournament.  It's been downhill from there though as I don't have the time to spend on the game that is required to stay on top.  The top players are playing in one or more tournaments per week compared to my every other month.  And that's fine. I'm cool with that, but it would be very intimidating to be dropped into that environment after the metagame is four years old.  Not everyone wants to take that kind of beating in order to learn the game.  That's not happening with LOTR.  And it's wonderful.

All LCGs re-use mechanics from one or more earlier games, but every game feels different in these combinations. If they take dual-sided investigators like Conquest's warlords and mix in the "every card is useful" resource mechanic of CoC, insanity like threat from LotR and decks consisting of nothing but utility actions, no units, that would make a game that feels extremely different from all the others.

 

You'd still have the same streamlined keywords and ways of handling mechanics from more recent games like Conquest and AGoT 2e (and possibly others since about 2012-2013). It will still have two handfuls of tokens, most likely. There might be mini-cards for special uses. I could see them taking the inventory mechanic from other Arkham games with a dash of the loot in LotR saga boxes. Finding a truly unique mechanic isn't something I expect nowadays - we'll have to combine ideas instead.

Pssssh... Christopher Tolkien is 94... Soon he will kick the bucket and the Silmarilion IP will be passed on to more sensible hands... so we might just get First and Second Age expansions in just a few years, just as the Saga boxes are coming to an end. I get why Christopher has been very reserved with exploiting the rights of his father's work but honestly the LotR LCG is a fine product, worthy to retell these modern classics tales.

You don't need a First or Second Age license to do the themes I mentioned though. Corruption is still a major theme in the Third Age writings, there were presumably in the Third Age plenty of lesser magic rings around (there are many magic rings in this world, Bilbo Baggins, etc), as well as 3 different Palantiri in the possesion of the Free Peoples. Instead we have a generic and not that good Palantir, and the whole Doomed mechanic which was going in a great direction with cards like The Seeing-stone and Keys of Orthanc went down the sinkhole.

## 74 [FetaCheese on May 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2233392)

They will almost certainly put out more Palantir cards in the future. I bet they could even make an expansion based around a Palantir.

I think they took it easy with the Doomed mechanic because they wanted to gauge the power level of the cards. To be honest it is difficult to design compelling doomed cards. I am sure will be seeing more at some point, just like we did with Rohan cards. Noone said they've abandoned the mechanic.

Christopher Tolkien has done tremendous work protecting the writings that he compiled, edited and published, and the Tolkien Estate will continue his good work keeping those properties out of the hands of money men who want to turn them into action-adventure garbage that spits on the themes therein.

 

FFG's lax attitude to the source material is exactly the kind of thing that puts the Estate off dealing with people.

Lord of the Rings LCG has been anything but lax on their interpretations of Tolkien's work and even their custom made content is a good measure of quality above "garbage". Read the Antlered Crowd designer notes to see with how much care and humility Matt and Caleb have approached the IP. Nothing can spoil the original works anyway, especially if one is picky as to whom they work with. There is a difference between between hoarding and being selective. The stories in Silmarilion are overflowing with theme that begs to be retold in other mediums. Yes games (and movies) will never compare to the book as a medium, but should we discard them as worthless? I think not. That is a purist's perspective and a loss for everyone involved.

If not for Christopher The Lord of the Rings would not exist, and the other writings would certainly not have for their way out of J.R.R.s disordered piles of scribbles and notes.

You can't turn an Epic (in the classical term) into a movie and have it be just as good as the book, still not garbage though. Would you rather the movie was never made? I think we'd be culturally poorer for it. And by made I mean "made with a realistic budget".

He isn't taking anything to the grave. He edited and published the works for everyone to enjoy.

 

 

There are plenty of fantasy action adventure franchises (films, games, cards etc.) in the world if you're happy with loose adaptations of Tolkien. The Silmarillion stamp won't make them better or worse or more authentic. Those are the products The Estate restricts the licence from. If a filmmaker came to Christopher and could give genuine assurances of producing The Fall of Gondolin authentically for screen the licence would be granted.

> Would you rather the movie was never made?

 

Yes. 

 

 

We've not lost anything "culturally" because there already exists an entire genre of fiction derivative of Tolkien, just as his own writing was derivative of older epics. Tolkien is a single step in a broader cultural progression. An adaptation of one book (sanitised for modern audiences, naturally) isn't a significant loss.

The biggest issue here is that we have never been in this situation before. CoC and Invasion were old and/or unpopular. I mean, compare the number of BGG fans.

Invasion-575

Lotr is one of their top games, and people are still buying it. Will they cancel a game of that magnitude just because another game came? My guess is no.

Personally, I think the world would be a better place without Tauriel.  I enjoyed the LOTR movies more, but they did needless violence to the source material (also true of Rankin-Bass as well, of course).  I admire the work that Christopher Tolkien has done and feel I owe him a debt of gratitude for the good things he's done.  Despite his advanced age, I think it is in very poor form to cheer for the man's funeral.

 

Having said that, I think this game we enjoy demonstrates consistent thematic and also detailed respect to the source material.  I would *love* to see FFG get rights to all the Tolkien material, and I think the world would be a better place for it.  I'm not rooting for Christopher Tolkien to die, but I would like to see the Tolkien's estate attitude soften towards those who have shown they can treat the source material with respect.

 

Also, I'm not sure the Tolkien estate is the only thing standing in the way of First age saga expansions.  The LOTR is far, far more famous, and moving time (and place) would instantly make nearly all our unique cards unthematic.  FFG already has the rights to the appendices, which contain enough information for saga expansions around the end of the second age and beginning of the third, and I think those would be awesome -- but I'm not at all expecting that to happen.  If not those, would the Silmarillion really be of interest to FFG?

I don't know if I want the world opened up. Part of what makes a story deep and epic is the unknown. For instance, some of the magic of Tolkien's world was lost for me when I discovered Arda was mapped beyond Middle Earth.

 

I would rather the whole epic be wrapped up with a definitive period, and allow my imagination to wander in all that is left unsaid, than for ever more details to be ever more forthcoming and spoiling the joy of my curiosity and imaginings.

> Lotr is one of their top games, and people are still buying it. Will they cancel a game of that magnitude just because another game came? My guess is no.

 

True, but popularity is not the only consideration.

 

The most obvious blockage would be an expiration of their license, and an inability to extend/renew it. I'm sure FFG would be willing to offer quite a bit of cash to keep the LotR license, but that's not a guarantee they would succeed.

 

Another thing to consider is the rate of new fanatics. Although there are many new players catching the LotR LCG bug, and there will always be new people who will go all-in and want to get all expansions, it's a simple fact that the longer the game goes the fewer people will be willing to go all-in. Some people see a massive game as exciting, while many others see it as demoralizing.

 

"What, you mean there are over fifty expansions - or more like 100 counting nightmare decks? And I'd basically have to get them all to fully participate in the metagame, understand what the podcasters are talking about, and be able to make most of the decks listed online? Ug, overwhelming. Pass."

 

In addition, even the hard-core fans can eventually reach their limits. Every cycle, there is another wave of people deciding they've had enough, and they stop buying. Or their buying dramatically reduces.

 

Shadows of Mirkwood and Dwarrodelf sell like hotcakes. Against the Shadow does fairly well, but is noticeably less. And I bet every cycle thereafter has a decrease. They still sell a lot, of course, but new players are simply less likely to buy later expansions. And LotR isn't the greatest game for jumping around in your purchases. Sure, it can be done, but you're going to have a pretty rough time with many of the later releases if you don't have a bulky card pool of earlier ones.

 

At some point, FFG has to ask themselves whether the continuing drop in activity is worth the expense and effort of putting out more expansions. Even if they do the math and decide a new expansion won't be worth much, they will likely still continue to do so for a while simply because new people are more likely to buy at least a little bit for a game perceived to still be supported. But at some point, even that won't be worth it.

 

Just to be clear, I have zero reason to believe LotR is anywhere near its end. I'm just pointing out that popularity alone is not guaranteed to mean the game will continue. They could be selling a million core set boxes a month, and it still wouldn't be worth putting out more expansions if only a small handful of dedicated fanatics were to buy it.

Well theme is a curious beast to tackle but I still think it can be done if we keep things a bit open ended. LOTR LCG is supposed to be taking place before the actual story of the books, so that there is leeway to deckbuilding and questing. Similarly a First Age expansion could have thematic leeway by being not exclusively recreating the stories, or by presenting them in a different fashion (e.g. being retold as tales). There could even be a seperate First Age box that is individually playable out of the box (like its own little core set) but still plug-and-play with the other expansions. After all whether a player takes the Eagles inside Moria or not is a personal choice, not a weakness of the handling of the IP imo.

Lotr LCG newer expansions sell well in my area still.

I promise I'm not intentionally trying to stir things up, but...  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Tauriel is one of the better parts of the hobbit films. She is an actual character with an arc and development that she goes through; very rare in that trilogy. Tolkien's The Hobbit she is not, but her scenes are generally better than the pointless effects and spectacle.

 

And to describe Peter Jackson's films as accurate is itself inaccurate. Almost every scene was rewritten, reordered and restructured. Popular understanding of the books now leans heavily on the films (as this card game demonstrates). Remember when Frodo and Sam leave Bag End together? Remember how Gandalf didn't want to go into Moria to face what he knew lurked there? Theoden's rousing speech about Death at Pelennor fields?

 

Outside the obvious changes that people are consciously aware of (Elves at Helm's Deep, no Tom Bombadil), how people remember the books has changed significantly due to the films. Frodo, Sam and Pippin left Bag End together. Gandalf was keen to try Moria. Eomer cried Death and it was a cry of grief, the death he sought was his own.

I'm not ashamed to admit that I likely would not have gotten into the card game if not for the Peter Jackson movies, and I likely would not have read the books if not for the card game.

Yes, but it also serves to preserve their experience.

 

The Lord of the Rings film trilogy was wonderfully done, but my interpretation of the book has been irrevocably altered by having viewed the movies. If a Silmarillion film were to be made, it would undeniably result in more people reading the book. But the book they would be reading would not be The Silmarillion they could read today.

I think it is an interesting issue with IP in general. Like do you think Tolkien's works will ever be in the public domain? Would it be better if it is always owned by some entity that determines what is a respectful use of the source material? Would it be better if someone still owned the rights to all of Shakespeare's works to prevent crazy interpretations like that Leonardo DiCaprio version of Romeo + Juliet from 1996? I'm sure there are some Romeo and Juliet slot machines out there as well  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

To sorta bring it back to the OP, is it a bad thing that Cthulhu mythos stuff is public domain? Has it ruined reading H. P. Lovecraft?

The Fall of Gondolin is the best part, and the version in The Silmarillion isn't the best one in print (Book of Lost Tales Part 2), so it gets a big thumbs down from me.

Indeed. If you haven't picked up BoLT, definitely give it a read, or at least The Fall of Gondolin. (My username is named after my favorite character from that story.) Silmarillion does also have the tale of Beren and Luthien, which is another of my favorites and gives you some context to Aragorn's song in Fellowship of the Ring.

It made me think of the Bible as well, especially since it basically starts with Genesis and consists of tales of early days of creation.

Back to the original topic:

 

* Even if this is a troll (and not a leak of a mockup), I'm sure FFG employees have noticed the interest and have some cogwheels turning, so it may yet come to pass.  (If it is a hoax, I can see employees kicking themselves for not thinking of it.  On the other hand, it's a pretty obvious idea given the cancellation of the Call of Cthulhu LCG.)

 

* The fact that Star Wars was originally designed as a co-op meant that FFG was willing to have 2 coop LCGs at the same time.

 

* The announcement of a new game doesn't have to correspond 1-1 with the death of an old one.  The number can fluctuate if the market grows or shrinks.  Old games can die and new games can be created and eventually an equilibrium can create itself.  It just happens to be 5 active games right now, with another (L5R) announced for 2017.  The number could go up to 7 (or it could shrink again to 5 -- see my next point).

 

* Star Wars and Conquest are the least well-off of the games.  LotR is doing well.  Unless they did not have the option of renewing the license, I don't see them discontinuing LotR.  At worst, I'd see them slow things down to let people catch up.  Personally, I think coops need a slower release cycle than a tournament game.  Star Wars and Conquest are the ones that look to be in the most danger.

 

* The death of CoC left a space for fans of the IP.  While a coop is not the same as a versus game, FFG does think heavily in terms of IPs, so it makes sense to have another LCG in the Arkham Horror universe.

 

* A strong market for LotR could indicate that there is space for 2 coops -- reinforced by the fact that Star Wars was originally going to be a coop.

 

* In short, I don't think LotR will be cancelled anytime soon, unless FFG fails to have a choice in the matter.

 

* In short, even if this is a hoax, I think a coop Arkham Horror card game is an excellent idea.

I don't think the fan reaction over Star Wars is anything to be concerned about. Star Wars is all about a conflict between two sides, so it makes more sense to want it as a competitive game.

 

Lovecraft, on the other hand, is all about humanity struggling against an unfathomable unknown "other". This sounds perfect to me as a co-op.

I'm more curious about what will happen to the Warhammer Quest card game. Especially since GW went and released an actual Warhammer Quest board game. What would happen if GW decided that a card game of similar name would be competition for their board game?

Yeah, that one actually had me confused for a while. I thought the GW game was an expansion to the FFG game, and it took me a bit of investigation to figure out what had happened. I don't understand how the licensing for Warhammer could allow two companies to produce two different board games with the same name within a few months of one another.

I guess that's why despite astonishing success, no expansion was even announced for the Warhammer Adventure Card Game.

Doesn't warhammer quest have miniatures? Games Workshop often bundles new miniatures in a single boardgame product to maximise sales. Despite being a board game its intended for miniature wargamers, not boardgamers. Also, Warhammer Quest takes place in the Age of Sigmar timeline, not the classic Warhammer Fantasy universe.

True for sure, but setting the Lannisters so far in the lead at the start and then knowing they were going to get the box too. It's not like Stark was suddenly the favorite after they got they're box. They made up some ground sure but that's it.

To be fair, I actually think the dwarves thing happened because they were suddenly granted the Hobbit franchise after they had planned Khazad-Dum and they were stuck with a lot of dwarves. I hope so at least.

I the case of the Lannister fiasco, Nate publicly stated that the Lions were his favorite house and then made it so you could play Lions - or you could lose. Sad. I also believe that they knew that Lannister was going to be the second deluxe so they should have accounted for that.

I haven't read the books or watched the shows, but in a 1v1 game to have such an early imbalance strikes of shoddiness.

After playing 1.0 from the beginning and then seeing my collection become essentially worthless overnight was enough for me. I was smart enough not to buy in to 2.0. The meta for 1.0 was a complete mess/joke at multiple points in the game's lifecycle.

For competitive card games, given time one's collection will always become essentially worthless. If not because of a restructuring or end to the game, then due to obsolescence from newer cards being released.

 

Co-op games can surely lose value as well, but their player communities don't depend nearly as much on a consistent schedule of sponsored events.

I don't see any particular reason why FFG would end the Lord of the Rings game when it still seems popular and profitable.  They can obviously support multiple competitive LCGs, why can't they support multiple co-op LCGs as well?

 

Personally, if Arkham Horror is real then I will buy into it, and I'm currently looking to pick up a LotR collection as well.  No conflict.

I don't understand why L5R should be the game that replaces CoC. A co-op game based on the same background would be more logical.

BTW, as someone who loves Lovecraft, I was happy when on BGG they published some home made rules to play CoC solo: they are not perfect, but are still a nice way to have your Lovecraftian fix when other players aren't around. I do really hope that this is not a hoax.

Games don't generally "replace" other games, other than Thrones1->Thrones2.  Every game has a beginning and an end, but are not necessarily related to each other.

 

Each LCG has a theme, is either co-op or competitive, and has its own mechanics.  Which ones have to be similar to be a "replacement"?  Why is a different similarity less of a replacement?  It's because the concept is flawed I think to begin with.  The only real relationship is that there is a cap on how many games total FFG can manage, and even this is an unknown number and co-op and competitive games probably present different "loads" on that capacity.

 

In any event, I am looking forward to Arkham Horror if it is real, and also to seeing their take on L5R.  In other rumors...  I'm even more excited at the idea that AEG might reboot an ECG version of 7th Sea than I am for L5R.  I do love the L5R theme, but I'm not a fan of the winner-take-all handling of battles and it seems core enough that I don't expect FFG to change this aspect as it might alienate too many old fans.

 

Getting back to LotR, I'm scouting around to pick up a used collection if I can find a good deal on one.  I have no fear of it ending soon and even if it DID, there's tons of content to go through.

To get back to the original point, according to Caleb on CoTR Ep 100 they were already developing 2 cycles ahead when The Grey Havens was announced.

 

I have to say that the vibe on Ep 100 (quite long but worth a listen) was extremely positive and you got the impression that both Caleb and Matt are still working on LoTR LCG - which probably means that enough cycles have been locked in until at least 2018.

So 86 quests we know about. That leaves room for 2 more cycles, plus the 2 POD's per year. And that's just current development, according to Caleb.

I'd be shocked if they run out of ideas before the licence is up for renewal. FFG are definitely willing to renew, so it's down to what the owners think. We know it's near the end when they start churning out small standalone scenarios and nothing else. By that point there's still a huge game with more content than most non-RPG products, and a company willing to do reprints.

Do you have a favorite faction?

Right now, I think because of the novelty factor, the Night’s Watch and House Tyrell are my two favorite factions. I may eventually return to my Lannisters, but I can’t resist the flashy newcomers.

There isn't a Lannister problem, there's a perception problem. Martell, Stark, and Baratheon all have good matches against Lannister and two of them are even good against other factions. Is Lannister a little ahead of the curve? Yes. Insurmountably so? No.

With GenCon only a couple of weeks away, I imagine we will be getting confirmation of this one way or the other.  Just today I read the thread at BGG regarding this rumor.  It was filled with a fair bit of "LOTR is dying" stuff, but there was a really good point in there by someone that doing another solo/co-op LCG would probably be pretty brilliant because it would allow FFG to capitalize on all of the lessons that they have learned from LOTR.  Another point that I thought was pretty encouraging was that FFG is not generally in the habit of just reskinning its big games so that this would probably involve some unique mechanics rather than just an Arkham wrapped version of LOTR.  

 

Though I'm sure that my better half wouldn't appreciate the impact on our bank account, I am pretty hopeful that, if this turns out to be a real thing, that we could look forward to both of them for a long time to come.  And if it turns out not to be real...No bigs. we've still got LOTR.

Well, given the pacing of LotR releases, the impact on your bank account won't be that daunting :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Also, lessons from LotR LCG are good, though not that applicible if AH LCG will be actually different. Well, that depends on how different it will be. Judging by the description from the screenshot, deck is gonna be built around single hero and his abilities (gives me warhammer conquest vibe), which might even suggest there won't be any allies, which on it's own leads to drastically different gameplay and mechanics in the first place.

I disagree.  I think picking up Nickola Tesla as an ally (etc.) would be a good part of the game.  Not anymore abstract than what we have now in LOTR. The suggestion of skills as an attachment as well as artifacts is great though.

 

I say again that if this happens I hope they find a way to keep that brilliant resourcing.

Plenty of allies in the other mythos games such as Elder Sign and Arkham Horror.

I can imagine resource gaining being counterblanced somehow with sanity.

I would say that ally aspect, while not absent, is pretty pale within Arkham Horror universe in comparison's to LotR. One of the mains reasons is that most of the people are oblivious even to the existance of the eldritch stuff itself. Investigators usually work solo, or in extremely tight groups.

Agreed, I would say allies are definately required as the HPL stuff Ive read tends to go with the tight group aspect, 2-4 people, but as you say not to the extent of LotR with half a deck of allies.

Lesser allies wouldnt work as over time a card pool would grow to mean more allies available, so maybe a restriction on how many allies per deck, or better yet how many allies per specific investigator-card, thus enabling some investigators to have more allies and some less which would reflect the particular character of that investigator, either a loner, or a small Miskatonic University group for example. That would be nice, restricted allies :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

There might be special deckbuilding rules to ensure allies fit then. Either something like Netrunner's system with a point value per ally, or ally sets similar to Star Wars objective sets? Mix that with Conquest-ish investigator sets for the strangest deckbuilding rules so far :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

So...with the announcement of the 2nd Ed of Mansions of Madness is it pretty safe to assume that the Arkham Horror LCG is probably not a thing?  At least not a thing that we are going to see soon?  It'd be weird for them to roll out two big games for the same license simultaneously right?

FFG has announced so many things this past week, like:

 

DOOM: The Board GAme

The Extraordinary Adventures of Baron Munchausen

Mansions of Madness

Game of Thrones: The Iron Throne

Star Wars Armada Campaign Expansion

 

It wouldn't surprise me if they saved the big announcement for the new Arkham LCG for Gen Con.

Looks like the first cycle will be set in 1920's Alaska. That's a great horror setting! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Seems like they're also considering using the Elder Sign brand instead of just Arkham Horror. That would be a bit strange to me, since Arkham Horror is a much stronger brand for my local playgroups.

Ok, so now it is real ! Don't know when it will be announced and released, but at least it will be very hard for someone to explain it's still a fake.

There is an official FFG illustrator who works on this project. 

Can't imagine huge campaigns (like Masks of Nyarlathotep of Fungi of Yugoth for instance) . :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

Please FFG make this real soon and do a nice game system.

With sanity and health, with some allies, with uniques weapons, (enigmas cards for campaign mode maybe)

All this art was commissioned and used for Elder Sign: Omens of Ice, more than one year ago. This clearly doesn't mean the AH LCG is not a thing; it simply means the art has already been used on an FFG game.

Not so sure if Destiny falls into the CCG category, tho. It's more of a dice game with some cards than a card game with dice (in the sense that dice seem to be the core of the action). Plus, Destiny targets a completely different type of public, so the two games shouldn't be mutually exclusive (or so I hope)

*hugs jodueit* Yes! This is good news!  Thanks for sharing! why can't I like that post only once?

Okay seriously why isn't this on the news page, FFG? But who cares,

I've got a friend who is totally in to Lovecraft, and he just expressed interest!

 

Let's hope that FFG learned a lesson with this core set, and didn't include any one-of cards when you can have three in your deck. Buying a third core set just for a third copy of Unexpected Courage is such a joke!

They are getting better at it: with 40k conquest you had every card in there once (except for those that belonged to your warlord), so while you still had to buy multiple cores, you weren't stuck with piles of unusable doubles.

I'm pretty traditional when it comes to playing by the book, so for me, it certainly feels enforced ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png].  Given the theme, the campaign seems appropriate.

This is similar to the AGOT reset in that they can yse experience to guide their design and avoid past mistakes. My assumption is that this will be a far more polished game. Forcing players to include weaknesses in their deckbuilds, for instance, is an interesting way to make more powerful characters. My guess is that the campaign mode works in the same way. The campaign creates design space to include more powerful cards with inherent limitations.

How? You'll need to explain that one :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

This is a new game, not a reboot of an existing game. The old CoC LCG was a duel game where you actually played the mythos factions too. This is more of a different take on the investigator versus NPC style of nearly every other Arkham game.

I explained my point in the sentance. It is similar to the reset in that they can use experience from the past to make a better game. I was mainly referring to their experience with LOTR as that is also a coop lcg, but they also had the other cthulu game. Yes, there are differences, but that does not invalidate my point.

But they do that all the time anyway - every LCG is an improvement in that respect ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

The AGoT reset was a reset of the actual game, with a new release of a very similar game in the same setting. I think that's a completely different thing than a new and improved LCG formula.

In the rest of his post, he mentions that they can learn from their past experiences gained fro GoT 1.0 to make 2.0 better.  It's implied that they have hopefully learned some lessons about a co-op game from LotR and can apply them to AH as they develop and expand it.  

 

After reading the article, I actually get the feeling this game is taking several things from different games, not just LotR.  With the way you gain experience to purchase cards to modify your deck as you go through the campaign it reminds me of Descent.

Yeah, their games are really starting to blend now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Investigator + gear is both in the board game variant and Warhammer Quest, I guess. So are the large character cards. Campaign from WQ and LotR sagas. Upgrades like Pathfinder. If two cores give a full playset the allowed card counts might also be different than most of the other LCGs (or there will be annoying extra cards).

 

I hope we get some video demos from GenCon.

Although I think Calmien is just kidding, I'll throw in the obligatory "not necessarily, the two can co-exist, LOTR has lots of life" boilerplate.  I had not realized, however, that Matt was one of the designers.  Of course, he could be in on the base but not  many of the on going cycles.  Or ( and I think this is more likely) the Sagas might be finished up in development and LOTR no longer gets two devs. 

 

Lots of excitement ahead!

Not at all excited about the new LCG but I suspect that Lord of the Rings the Card game will continue to be made as long as it continues to perform on sales.  Unfortunately since we don't really have any economic figures the only thing we have to go on is what FFG has said in the past about the game which really isn't a whole lot.  FFG has mentioned that Netrunner is their most popular and best selling LCG, Warhammer Conquest has had the biggest and most successful release.

 

There is something to say about the commitments FFG has, these licensed franchises like Lord of the Rings come with contractual obligations.  We don't know what those are either but I will predict the following.

 

1. Arkham Horror LCG will sell very well.  Arkham Horror the Board Game is one of their longest running and successful lines (this we not with 100% certainty) and there is a pretty big built in fan base.  The fact that they are making an LCG should come to the surprise of no one, it's really a wonder that it took them so long to make one.

 

2. Lord of the Rings is already 5 years old, that is a nice run and really the only unfinished business it has at this point is the next cycle and the completion of the Saga expansions.  I think it's safe to say they will wrap up both before they discontinue the line which would give the game a sense of completion.

 

3.  FFG is not stupid, if a game makes money they will continue to produce, if it doesn't they will kill it.

 

4.  FFG has a reputation for continuing support via reprints well after a game is discontinued.   Some good examples are Warhammer RPG and Game of Thrones 1st edition (still in print today despite 2nd edition release).

 

Suffice to say Lord of the Ring card game fans have nothing to complain or worry about.  It has been a successful run of a great game, the fact that it will be discontinued at some point is enevitable and there is currently enough content released today to play the game indefinitely.  We know that there will be some more content coming out in the form of at least one adventure cycle and the completion of the Saga expansions, I think this we can count on.

 

All and all the release of Arkham LCG probably marks a point at least where some evaluation will take place of LoTR but we can always hope that the game is still popular and profitable enough for FFG to continue the line.

 

For those playing competitively (event stuff), typically long after a game ceases to be officially supported, events continue as long as there are people willing to show up for them so the reality is that Lord of the Rings the Card Game will live on as long as their is a fan base sufficient to support it.

It's not that it doesn't count but Arkham Horror is a beloved ffg franchise, it has a built in audiance and presumably functions in a manner remenescent of the board game. It will sell like tickets to a wet t-shirt contest.

It's worth pointing out too that CoC didn't sell very well because it wasn't a good game, a franchise can't hold up a bad game. It's safe to say FFG has learned a thing or two about making card games since.

I've just watched Covenant's demo vid on Arkham Horror and it seems like it plays much more differently to LoTR. It has strong RPG and boardgame elements. Can't say I am a big fun of the chaos bag mechanic (simulates dice rolls?). As I suspected it doesn't seem like a replacement to LoTR.

The bag simulates a die with a changing number of sides, it seems.

Yep, looks like the bag is part of it. It's "the chaos bag" and has some game-specific logo on it. Not that these are necessarily expensive to make, but it's a nice touch if it's in the box, as it seems.

Why do all these games come back to dicemasters around here? ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  The collectable dice game has no bag but the LCG has? All confused here.

 

No wait I'm good.

 

Hope the bag is descent quality. DM also had bags, but they weren't exactly top quality.

Yeah, the stock bags in DM are paper (baby barfbags with different print, really), but they sell some rather nice ones separately. AHLCG looks like it's getting a decent, large FFS bag out of the box.

That mat is not in the box so assuming the bag is might be folly.

Well, no, the mat obviously isn't. But a bag isn't expensive. Nobody said the mat was included :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

But there is a blind token-picking mechanic involving a bag, so it's not a stretch to think they might include the bag. Which is a cheap item to produce, really.

So in time for Halloween? That would be nice. Altough I doubt FFG concerns itself with that sort of thing, they didn't release that zombie rpg before Halloween either.

I doubt its the end now.

 

Arkham replaces Cthulhu

 

L5R replaces Conquest which replaced Invasion

 

 

So unless you count Destiny, they are still at six LCGs.

I honestly doubt that L5R replaces Conquest. Conquest is just to new to be replaced this early.

 

If L5R replaces an LCG (which is a big if in my opinion) it would most likely be Star Wars. Star Wars LCG isn´t selling that good/isn´t very popular and they have Destiny they could hope Star Wars fans would adapt to.

I'm also of the opinion that, while I don't necessarily think Arkham Horror kills LOTR, I do think LOTR can't keep going forever. I love the game and would carry on buying for ages, but the current and upcoming cycles already represent quite a departure from the core license and there's presumably only so much content the game still needs or can accommodate.

The heartening part of this though is that, unlike the competitive LCGs which are only really playable inside a vibrant competition scene, this game will be just as playable after new releases end. That said, I would like to see the fellowship events and promos continue for a while.

Srba makes some very good points...that I'd like to make counterpoints to :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

1)  I am not enough of a ME lore expert to suggest actual names, but I would imagine that there are still places within the "standard" parts of the map that we haven't fully explored yet.  In addition, I think there are lots of places on the edge of the map (such as in the current and upcoming cycles) that offer possibilities for lots of future exploration.  While I think running out of locations/quest ideas is a possibility I don't think that we are quite there yet (as an aside I have really enjoyed the stuff that is a little bit less traditional in location and love how it ties into the lore).  

 

2)  Compared to the other LCGs, LOTR designers have a much slow pace of player card production due to a large chunk of each pack being encounter cards.  This means that they probably have a lot of design room left on the player cards to explore that leaves the game long term viable from the perspective of having to come u with new player cards.

 

3)  FFG has demonstrated that it will keep successful franchises going for a LONG time (GoT 1st ed) if they are making money and we have been consistently told that LOTR is on of the better sellers.

 

4)  Just supposition on my part, but I think that AH LCG is probably a response to how well LOTR is doing and a desire to move further into that market (not to mention the opportunity to capitalize on lessons learned from LOTR...esp with two of its designers at the helm!).

 

5)  Recent interviews with the designers all seem to point toward a fair bit of unannounced content already in development and a positive outlook...though obviously they are FFG employees and can't go out and say  "sorry folks...games done!" in an interview.

 

6)  I DON"T WANT IT TO BE DONE!!!  ...though you are right we have been blessed with lots of content and can continue to play long after it is not being produced.

 

 

Finally, as an aside, good job OP of this thread...you totally called it!!

Yes, AHLCG is probably at least partly a result of the popularity of LotRLCG. They have more control over an Arkham Horror game, although not full access to whatever they want from the extended Cthulhu mythos. I wouldn't be surprised if they also make a Terrinoth LCG once LotR ends.

After pathfinder, Legendary Encounters and sentinels of the multiverse this will be another fun and interesting alternative / break from lotr lcg for me. Like all other co-op card games out there i don't expect it to come even close to lotr lcg tho.

P.S. sry for my english

Related to the future of LOTR (which, as stated above, I think is bright) ....So I was looking at the credits for the Grey Havens and Matt is the Designer for that box. He was also recently on COTR.  So it seems he has been still working on LOTR during the creation of AH.  Does anyone know if he is going to maintain involvement in both games going forward?  Maybe someone got to talk to him at Gen Con?  

 

I guess I could view it as a win either way (because AH looks really cool and I'm planning on jumping into it on the ground floor), but his work on the last few cycles of LOTR has been really awesome and I'd be bummed to see him leave entirely.

We don't know is the short answer...but in the COTR Ep 100 Interview two or so months ago, there was no sign that either Matt or Caleb were stopping working on LoTR. In fact the whole 3 hour interview was extremely positive (they come across as really good guys), and bearing in mind they work 18 months or so in advance they could be at 2 least cycles ahead internally to what we are seeing.

 

Looking at the Gameslore (UK online shop) list of top sellers, three LoTR LCG packs are currently in the top 15 list of top selling games. Plus if you look at BGG new people are rocking up all the time. The game will of course end one day, but there's absolutely no sign of that at the moment. And even if it does, there is a ton of content anyway.

I'm necro'ing this thread due to the news FFG just announced about their lack of renewal regarding ALL of the their Games Workshop properties.  Bye Conquest.   I hardly knew you.      That aside, I've heard that this hasn't been very surprising since they haven't announced anything new for Conquest in awhile.  Which makes me wonder about LotR.   We all KNOW they have plenty of material to work with and continue to build out on.  Plenty to explore and no end to the stories they can create.   But just because there is plenty available doesn't necessarily translate into an agreeable new-terms-of-licensing whenever their current contract is up.   I've remember some of you mentioning it was due up relatively soon.  Do we know exactly when?  Do we have an promised products that will take us beyond that date?

I feel it is a legitimate discussion though.  I'm not too keen on sifting through the last 14 pages, but I do remember someone posting about FFG's license for LotR needing to be renewed in the relative future.  Does anyone know that actual date?

As far as i know, the relationship between FFG and the owner of LOTR license is good ... We can't said the same between FFG and GW.

 

We have the 7th cycle announced. We have event announced. We have Nightmare announced etc ...

Since i don't follow the other games, I've no idea how the relationship is with GW.  But even though I do follow LotR, I've still no clue how their relation ship is with the owner of the LotR license.  So I guess I'll take your word that it is solid.  I still plan to buy everything they make regardless of whenever they decide to stop this game, but I was just curious if there was going to be a slightly abrupt end at some point like there seems to be with Conquest.

Same discussions as here.

I think that the game is in good health and the relationship between FFG and license owner is good.

 

I will worry when we will have a lack of communication (like W:C at Gencon).

That thread started in May and ended in July.  There have been other unsubstantiated rumors since then.  Since the  Asmodee merger things have changed and not for the better imo.  There seems to be much more attention paid to the bottom line and less on the gaming experience as a whole.

 

I love the game and will continue to buy everything for as long as I can.  I don't really have the time to stay on top of the AGoT metagame for example and don't enjoy OCTGN.  I will probably drop out of that as I can't keep up.  But in LOTR I can play the games at my own pace and "I am my own metagame".  Nothing else like it.

 

We'll see about Arkham.  I've ordered two core and hope it's good, but I'm starting to get that "too fiddly" feeling from the previews.  LOTR is so clean.

 

(Sorry that is just a bunch of disjointed thoughts.)

Do you think so? I don't see that with regard to LoTR LCG - if anything the game just gets better and better. Just my opinion of course.

 

Arkham Horror ACG could either be fiddly as you say or genuinely revolutionary - the first ever card game that simulates a RPG. I for one will be very interested to see the player reviews when the game comes out.

My thoughts on licensing:

 

1) It is very likely that whatever license FFG has to use Tolkien's material has some sort of expiration or renewal date, and thus could theoretically expire before FFG chooses to end the game for other reasons.

2) It is very likely that ANA will never reveal those dates or any other information from that license to us, mere fans of the game.

3) It is very likely that the licensing entity (i.e. not the Tolkien Estate) has a vested interest in continued revenue from FFG/ANA and won't pull the plug on licensing unless they can somehow make more money elsewhere.  Given their promiscuous licensing, it seems unlikely to me that FFG's license is blocking more profitable revenue streams.  However, having an incentive to come to a mutual beneficial licensing deal with FFG does not mean they will accomplish it, as both entities may overestimate their worth to the other party.

4) It is very likely that ANA will not continue the game at a loss, and this will certainly be a factor in the terms of any rights renewal.

 

Someday the game will end.  I'm skeptical that it will end because an otherwise-profitable game could no longer get the necessary rights, but I suppose it's possible that if its popularity/profitability is declining, it won't make financial sense for ANA to renew the rights if/when the current contract expires.  I'm not going to worry about it, since:

1) I have no idea when the current contract expires

2) I have no idea how the current/future contract affects profitability.

3) I have no fear that Christopher Tolkien with somehow acquire Middle Earth Enterprises and quash games like these.

Sorry but gotta disagree with you there. I need to be a bit careful because for all I know you really like that game, whereas I loathed it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]!

 

I have to say though, that my experience of Pathfinder ACG was go to a location that was very similar to all of the others, flip a card thematically unrelated to that location (sea monster in a tower gateway anyone?) and roll a dice to either fight or acquire some sort of item. Then repeat. Repeat again. And again. Play another Pathfinder game that was exactly the same. Then again. And again. Ad infinitum!

 

The game has its charm, and it's much simpler than LoTR LCG, but it made my skin crawl! I also don't think it simulates the variety of an RPG at all!

 

Apologies if you really like it.

But it does really simulates an RPG, so AH LCG won't be the first. Good or bad - that's for each person to decide, but fact is fact.

lotr lcg is my first card game. i must ask then: how many years is the age of a game normally? which has been the game with more years? you think lotr-lcg will have an age over the average of the other games in ffg? thanks for the replies

The Mirkwood Runner is starting up the Nightmare series again, The Hive Tyrant is re-running the Progression Series at producing new content at a pretty new clip, there's more new cards and expansions announcements than I can keep straight, and even us commoners speculating here on the boards can come up with 3 or 4 decent ideas for full cycles. This game is not going anywhere for a good long while.

 

Mndela - it depends. Most CCG's last under a year, because Wizards has a monopoly on that market with MTG. As for LCG's, they seem to go strong for several years. A Game of Thrones was one of the better selling ones, but it suffered from problems with gameplay and balance. As a co-op, LOTR doesn't have those issues, and despite a few growing pains, the power curve is trending fairly in lockstep between player and encounter cards. I definitely think that our nerdy little piles of cardboard will outlast most other games you can think of. Even games like Catan and Dominion, staples of game night everywhere, seem to be winding down in terms of new spin-offs and editions.

Even if the game would end and they would just release the currently annouced stuff plus the remaining nightmare decks there would be over 120 expansions for this game.

GW may wish to publish their own card game or board game, so they end the cooperative relationship with FFG.

 

I think The Lord of the Rings owner wouldn't wish to publish card game or board game, Lovecraft too, so the liscence will continue

LotR LCG is an anomaly at this point. I don't see that many games which are still good overall after five years of churning out (almost) monthly expansions. Sometimes they should have stopped at the first set! Dominion has lasted as long as it has due to careful consideration before an expansion was made, and they even thought they had stopped at some point. But now there's a new box with glorious, tangible extra components, and I haven't seen any overwhelmingly negative responses. But I'm behind on that game too, because just a few sets include a wealth of fun.

 

As long as FFG keep their promise of reprinting while there is interest, they could end the game after the release of all announced products for this game. There are many who have some catching up to do, so it will probably sell well for years to come if there's stock.

I have to agree.  PACG is 'okay'.  We're currently halfway into Wrath.  It's an okay deck builder, but I wouldn't say it simulates an RPG.  It might simulate Diablo?  But that's as far as I would give it.  There's no interesting effects.  Loot is REALLY hit or miss.  (You get a Paladin sword! ..with no Paladin in the party.)  But it's okay.

... I think that's a real deal. I am a not-so-new player, I just finished the Against the Shadow cycle and I am playing now my first Saga (The Hobbit - God I wish I could have Beorn/Foe-Hammer/A Very Good Tale/Cram when I was exploding my nerves against Perir in Pelargir and Into Ithilien!). I don't own any GenCon nor Nightmare packs. And I do want to buy / play the 6 other saga expansions out there, and voice of isengards, and the lost realms, and the grey havens, and the sands of harrads. Even if they stopped there, I think I can transfer at least 1 000$ from my paychecks in the wallet of FFG in the following years. And I am pretty sure I am not alone in this!

The Lord of the Rings LCG will always have a slight edge over comparable games because of the IP. Even if there was a co-op LCG that was slightly better than LotR, I would still play LotR, since I'm a Tolkien nerd. There are many people who play that would not play another game and only play this one because of the IP.

 

Short answer: Middle-Earth > all

Which is exactly what the designers said they wanted to do.  (Who were designers of LoTR by the way so that explains the "release" schedule.) They wanted to design an experience that was more about the individual players and that felt less like controlling a group that wasn't really character focused.  Their words.

It definitely seems like it might have a little bit what with all the indescribable creatures and locations that would drive you mad just to witness that are now illustrated in FFG products.

I'm just gonna' go with the simple here.  YES it is ALWAYS important that a creator and their estate control their works and their vision.  Think about it as if you were a creator.  Also the Arkham Files stuff is not just Lovecraft based it also takes from the VERY extended universe that is more due to Chaosium and Call of C'thulu than Lovecraft.  That's why it feels more like an adventure and less like a really boring walk that always ends with either and ellipsis or the *stunning* revelation that the protagonist IS the monster.  The central idea that there can even be something entirely unknown is not a "cool theme" it's an affront to Science.  You can always know, learn or find out, and this is coming from a "retarded" person.  The same thing that makes the Arkham Files games fun, is the same exact thing that made Monty Python funny.  It's ABSURD.  Some people however, find something personally profound in Tolkien's work.  Including his estate.  It should be their right, to protect what their family created.

You're also responsible for a fair few Arkham Horror / Elder Sign / Eldritch Horror rules interpretations, that's probably what 5,777 of them or so?  See ya' when we start the card game!  Y'know I've been dying to ask you:  Who IS your favorite investigator and why if you would be so kind to assuage my curiosity?  I mean there's something about the Arkham Files you find irresistible right?  It can't be the "horror"  So what is it then?  : )

Do you think that's better than the LoTR LCG?  I had it at first but everything released so SLOW and the art was SO basic and bland so I traded it for ......well we won't talk about that on a board game forum, I'll get banned for life, but now I'm looking for a card based solo game and considering LoTR.  Do you think Pathfinder was better?  Did you finish it?  Does the art get (a lot) better?  It'll be just my luck that the art from LoTR is just what I want to look at (having never explored the Tolkien universe) and Pathfinder has the mechanisms I crave.  Figures....

Gosh that's swell of you but since I'm not a member of this "community" and just a consumer doing his research about a product (and saving a TON in the process so thanks for all you're incessant whining and unintentional revelation about your "beloved" game franchise, you represent it SO well!) I'm just gonna' take a "pass" on your direction there Mon' Capitain!  Kinda' the same way I'm gonna' take a pass on LoTR, and I'm no Nostradamus but I predict.......naw.  I'll let you superior types figure it out for yourselves.  See above.  I DON'T have the patience of a saint and I also don't appreciate not being able to use a public resource provided by a company I support up the wahzoo without a reprimand from someone with nothing better to do!  My research is done, and so is my interest in the game.  Well done Sparky!  Now go find someone to bark orders at that isn't worried we're somehow going to run out of space on the internets or that my misuse of FFGs sliver of it will somehow convince them that they don't want my money anymore 'kay?

wow dude, John was just trying to help you. He might not have sugar coated what he said but your reaction and tantrum are a vastly exaggerated response. Have you not been on the interwebz before? Don't let your jimmies get rustled so easily...

I stayed as nice as I possibly could and even tried to provide you with information about the game to help in your decision as you are extremely misinformed about this game and seem to have some mysterious grudge against it (literally EVERYTHING you have said about it has been negative) but you are just an extremely nasty individual and I should not have wasted my time.

 

Just for the record I wasn't trying to be negative but honestly think this game is not for you. You aren't a tolkien fan, seem to have a massive grudge against the game to begin with and have multiple concerns about it so I was trying to give honest feedback/advice. For many people the main draw of this game is the IP and you have zero interest in that IP. You also already play several solo games so it isn't like you are trying to find a main game to play on your own. This game is extremely time intensive because deckbuilding is such a major part of the game so if you already play several other solo games you might not have time for this one if you don't absolutely love it. Perhaps I should have been more explanatory and said this in that other post originally but how negative you were being right off the bat was frustrating so I didn't feel like breaking it down that much for you. Also you didn't respond to myself or even Crusader Lord who did a really informative write up of the game and solo play just for your benefit.

I don't really understand what sort of reaction you thought you were going to get being so negative and dismissive about this game on its official forums? This game is definitely not for you. Go back to the Arkham forum. Also solo games definitely seem like a good fit for you as you clearly do not play well with others!

Yeah I had a look at his various posts on the Arkham Forums and he is pretty awful to people on there. Saw him calling everyone who has any interest in the lore and storytelling aspect of the game (which I imagine is one of the main draw cards for the vast majority of players) "obsessive fanboys and girls". Really he should get off the forums all together if he can't show civility or respect for others! Doubt that will happen though.

The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game is great mechanics, but it really needs "rpg" added to it...  The story and gameplay direction is so simple... you really can destroy the game in a few lucky turns, or grind it out with worthless encounter after worthless encounter.  The enemies and "story" are far from memorable...

My plan is to simply use it as an RPG tool.  Sometimes you want to do an rpg but you don't want to dive into a bunch of books, or you want to have some fun action but don't want to break out miniatures...  I feel the card game is a good RPG medium for people who don't want to get too involved in the rules / measurements and just want fun, but the game NEEDS a storyteller to actually make a story with it.

EDIT - oh yeah, and the art is crap all the way through, and I would never recommend the game for solo play...  It's too simple to play solo.  Its much more a casual group game.  Great for people who want to play board games, but maybe don't have the patience for a game with depth (or as I recommended, if you write an rpg story for your group)

 

I would recommend LoTR as a solo game.  I've played it solo, and found it has a very different feel from playing multi-player, so you can enjoy the game both ways differently.  You can also dive into the Doom cards alone, which are a real bad thing to pull out in a multi-player session but add some spice to the solo experience.

Adding a storyteller for Pathfinder tACG is a great idea for a group like your talking about, but for someone who is just into mechanisms (me) who has to play pretty much solo, I think I was right to trade it away.  Thanks for the honesty shosuko!  I think I have found something else for just the strategic mechanism side of things without the setup of MageKnight, however.  Waitasec.  You *recommend* LotR for someone looking for solo mechanisms that also loves deck building?  Okay then.  I won't ask what makes it better than Pathfinder but what would I buy to get the best SOLO experience?  See it may sound weird, but it's true, I know nothing about the Tolkien story, so my idea was that since it would all be new to me, the exploration would be amazing!  Yet the reviews I've seen don't always make it seem so.  I don't trust them (which is why I wanted to ask people who were most likely to be weary of samey mechanisms and contradictory rule sets.) not because they are bad reviewers, but because they are biased by experience within the theme.  So if it wasn't JUST what they wanted to see....I feel they may have allowed that disappointment to color their judgment.  Also, I mean no insult here but the mechanisms look, simple so I fear the game will become a "digfest" as I try to mill just the right cards with just the right composition of starting pieces.  If I'm not right and I'm missing something please let me know.  Also, I will give it a shot if you can recommend "a real starting set", if that makes sense.  I realize that may include multiple cores as well as expansions but it may be awhile before I can be a regular with my play group again.  MageKnight *sigh*......., sorry, I'm back. MageKnight and Eldritch Horror/Mansions of Madness are just too big, I've played so much Elder Sign my box LOOKS like an ancient tome, but cards (yes, even a lot of them) are fine.  Sorry for being so cautious but I realize that this game represents a significant investment, and I tend to not do things in half-measure so I'm being really careful, but I DO see real potential in it.  I appreciate your help and in return will at least give it a shot up to the point that you recommend if you can tell me if those fears are justified or not, or if the game's expansions corrected those initial impressions that sadly most reviewers and teachers of the game seemed to convey.  Many thanks again for your help and understanding!  : )

> Just for the record I wasn't trying to be negative but honestly think this game is not for you. You aren't a tolkien fan, seem to have a massive grudge against the game to begin with and have multiple concerns about it so I was trying to give honest feedback/advice. For many people the main draw of this game is the IP and you have zero interest in that IP. You also already play several solo games so it isn't like you are trying to find a main game to play on your own. This game is extremely time intensive because deckbuilding is such a major part of the game so if you already play several other solo games you might not have time for this one if you don't absolutely love it. Perhaps I should have been more explanatory and said this in that other post originally but how negative you were being right off the bat was frustrating so I didn't feel like breaking it down that much for you. Also you didn't respond to myself or even Crusader Lord who did a really informative write up of the game and solo play just for your benefit.
> 
> I don't really understand what sort of reaction you thought you were going to get being so negative and dismissive about this game on its official forums? This game is definitely not for you. Go back to the Arkham forum. Also solo games definitely seem like a good fit for you as you clearly do not play well with others!

I don't have a massive grudge against the game.  I have an admitted ignorance of how it actually plays.  Can you "mutiquote" or whatever anything negative I've said about it?  Concerns?  Definitely!  Anyone about to invest as much as I will would as well, that's common sense!  Caveat Emptor are not words lost on me....after being burned by multiple game companies, they're ones I LIVE by.  Where did you give any advice about the game?  All you recommended was a reading list....a FICTIONAL one at that!  I didn't come here for a reading list my non fiction one is what makes me crave a break so I game while I let my mind grind through everything for a bit which is tough enough, I don't want to ADD to that!  Where are these informative posts?  Seriously I don't get responses to my posts so I must have honestly missed them and I'd like to read them.  I'm not looking for a "reaction" to anything but the GAME.  I don't live here, OR on the Arkham forum.  The only negative thing I said was about a game that looked like a toybox that threw up, and that's because it did!  Worse, it looked like it threw up on my beloved MageKnight!  (but I left that part out since I didn't want to be negative.)  OOps.  Look, I'm just trying to make a buying decision that represents a huge investment. Since your SUCH a keen investigator you may have noticed that I only post what?  Every coupla' YEARS.  So if you don't mind, I apologize if my honestly and directness have offended you sensibilities but I really AM just trying to make a decision here so if you can help - Great, I'd love that!  You ARE the people with the most experience.  However, if you're just trying to criticize or argue since you have nothing better to do (specifically apparently not this great solo game I've heard so much about.) seek elsewhere.

I haven't said anything bad about your game Gizlivadi, I only stated that I can't buy it anymore, which is true, and I have a chance to buy it now so I'm doing research on it.  That's it.  I just want to know which bits to buy, should I buy it at all, and if it's worth the considerable investment or should I just wait for Arkham Horror.

Got to play a demo of it yesterday.  It is very very cool.  The card upgrades after completing a quest is interesting.   We played a 4 player game and got through 2 scenarios. We had to use the alternate ending on both to get out before things got worse.  I found that to be really neat, the ability to end the scenario with out necessarily winning, or losing, where the decisions you make in the one scenario directly impact setting up the next scenario.  We got a little wrecked in the second scenario but decided we didn't have a good strategy in the first few turns, which turned out to be very critical.  Can't wait for this thing to get released!

The more I think about the deck building, and the card leveling, that makes for some really tight spaces in the monthly packs that come out.  Do we know if they are going to do an investigator per pack or will those only be in the deluxe boxes?

Also if it's dying it's kinda' weird that they're posting previews for new adventure packs still.  I never said the game was dying, I just wanted to know IF it was and why I couldn't order it from my FLGS which really just has a LOT more to do with something that this community should be a bit more concerned about:  "The cult of the new."  Without realizing it, I **** near donned the robes myself! 

 

This all started when I was amazingly excited about a new project that a couple of the developers of LoTR have been working on and are about to release.  Their presentation of their new project can be seen on YouTube and I highly recommend it:  "Arkham Horror LCG presentation @ Arkham NIghts 2016"  In my opinion, it is a master level class about how you design a compelling game, tool, and experience.  I got in trouble with the community because of quotes and ideas from that presentation.  I said nothing negative about LoTR (although, RuneWars fans DO have a right to be mad at me.  I apologize I was just sharing the honest first impression of a consumer on the off chance that FFG would hear it, because somewhens, they DO.)  For similar reasons I also wrote a response defending someone complaining that they couldn't buy the game at their FLGS that was told to find a new FLGS if they didn't carry LoTR saying I couldn't get it either. 

 

A couple of months ago by coincidence, Some in my game group been offered someone's LoTR "set" for $150.  The exact amount they wanted to buy into Mansions of Madness.  Ah, had only they been a bit more clever and done just a little more research they could have got me to pick it up immediately by telling me what LoTR IS.  I'll get into that more later as well as tell you how you can get a LOT more people into your game if you want.  They are sitting right there, as hungry for expansions as any LoTR player, not realizing (as I didn't) that they just have to EXPLORE a bit more and they'll find it.  That's so VERY fitting considering the theme, yeah?  Anywho, I dismissed her completely stating that I was "kind of done" with LCGs thanks.  Then I saw marcowargamers review of Arkham Horror.  I was intrigued and followed it to the video I posted above, after which I wanted to play LoTR but was curious why no one in our game group had played it including some people who apparently had a set for sale.  Research began. 

 

I am kinda' known for two things:  1.  Perceived repeated violations of the beloved Wheaton's law due to blunt, and admittedly brusque honesty.  2.  Walls of text   Let me try to save anyone interested in the results of my intensive research from the second one:  First, LoTR isn't and likely will never be "dead". for the same reasons my favorite game, MageKnight, will never be "dead."  It's playable solo, is a masterpiece of balanced and compelling mechanisms, is a different game with every adventure, the rules systems, while being very tight and make sense, tend to have an undeserved reputation that would make politics blush in spite of the fact that you have them down after a couple of plays, and anyone who has played it and loved it, pretty much always will. 

 

 Why?  Well here's where you can do players who really love MageKnight a huge favor and tell them about YOUR game.  LoTR is "Card based MageKnight."  I'm not saying they copied each other or anything like that, I'm saying they deliver the same "feel" and require the same level of thought and offer the same unbridled sense of adventure particularly if they have not experienced LoTR before due to inexperience or even because they may not like Tolkien's works.  In my case, I'm completely ignorant of the setting due to simply being MORE into Lewis, Assimov, Stackpole, Weiss-Hickman, and Anthony before segueing into 100% non-fiction.  So for me it's even better because every single CARD is a new discovery of something beautiful or challenging.  Regardless of theme, LoTR is a jewel that shines all on it's own. 

 

So there you go, a massive untapped vein of players who would love LoTR but don't even realize what it really IS.  Now back to that "Cult of the new".  That is the real reason my FLGS doesn't have any LoTR, it's not a concentrated effort to bury LoTR it's just short sightedness on the part of my FLGS and a focus on what's upcoming and hot and thereby should take that shelf space that should really always be dedicated to a great game like LoTR, after all you can always find MageKnight on IT's shelf of honor, LoTR deserves no less.  Too bad most stores see it more as a "hotness that was."  How do you beat that perception?  Visibility.  Play the game at your FLGS, try to buy it there even when you know you can't.  Let people see what it IS.  The art and subject will easily draw them in, and your explanations of the rules by allowing them to learn by seeing it in motion will get them past the worst hurdle.  I.E.: YOU play the super effective tactics deck while they play whatever they think they will like from a selection of great art and interesting ideas.  Or y'know you can just let them be "blinded" by Destin-!!!! OhwowItotallyforgot!! 

 

Uh, yeah so in summary LoTR is great and has a lot of potential to increase it's fan base, Arkham Horror is an EVOLUTION, not a replacement, Visibility will determine whether LoTR becomes "gamers little secret." or the next "Ticket to Ride" and I didn't mean to insult anybody.  Now if you'll forgive me, I must "away" because with all the research and discovery I let it slip my mind (Geez, speaking of limitless exploration and a constant evolution of skill and knowledge) that Xur's in town!!  ^ ^

They'll do new investigators in the Deluxe boxes, probably not in the Mythos packs.

 

But lest we threadjack this too much, check out the Arkham Horror forums!

it to the video I posted above, after which I wanted to play LoTR but was curious why no one in our game group had played it including some people who apparently had a set for sale.  Research began.  I am kinda' known for two things:  1.  Percieved repeated violations of the beloved Wheaton's law due to blunt, and admittedly brusque honesty.  2.  Walls of text   Let me try to save anyone interested in the results of my intensive research from the second one:  First, LoTR isn't and likely will never be "dead". for the same reasons my favorite game, MageKnight, will never be "dead."  It's playable solo, is a masterpiece of balanced and compelling mechanisms, is a different game with every adventure, the rules systems, while being very tight and make sense, tend to have an undeserved reputation that would make politics blush in spite of the fact that you have them down after a couple of plays, and anyone who has played it and loved it, pretty much always will.   Why?  Well here's where you can do players who really love MageKnight a huge favor and tell them about YOUR game.  LoTR is "Card based MageKnight."  I'm not saying they copied each other or anything like that, I'm saying they deliver the same "feel" and require the same level of thought and offer the same unbridled sense of adventure particularly if they have not experienced LoTR before due to inexperience or even because they may not like Tolkien's works.  In my case, I'm completely ignorant of the setting due to simply being MORE into Lewis, Assimov, Stackpole, Weiss-Hickman, and Anthony before segueing into 100% non-fiction.  So for me it's even better because every single CARD is a new discovery of something beautiful or challenging.  Regardless of theme, LoTR is a jewel that shines all on it's own.  So there you go, a massive untapped vein of players who would love LoTR but don't even realize what it really IS.  Now back to that "Cult of the new".  That is the real reason my FLGS doesn't have any LoTR, it's not a concentrated effort to bury LoTR it's just short sightedness on the part of my FLGS and a focus on what's upcoming and hot and thereby should take that shelf space that should really always be dedicated to a great game like LoTR, after all you can always find MageKnight on IT's shelf of honor, LoTR deserves no less.  Too bad most stores see it more as a "hotness that was."  How do you beat that perception?  Visibility.  Play the game at your FLGS, try to buy it there even when you know you can't.  Let people see what it IS.  The art and subject will easily draw them in, and your explanations of the rules by allowing them to learn by seeing it in motion will get them past the worst hurdle.  I.E.: YOU play the super effective tactics deck while they play whatever they think they will like from a selection of great art and interesting ideas.  Or y'know you can just let them be "blinded" by Destin-!!!! OhwowItotallyforgot!!  Uh, yeah so in summary LoTR is great and has a lot of potential to increase it's fan base, Arkham Horror is an EVOLUTION, not a replacement, Visibility will determine whether LoTR becomes "gamers little secret." or the next "Ticket to Ride" and I didn't mean to insult anybody.  Now if you'll forgive me, I must "away" because with all the research and discovery I let it slip my mind (Geez, speaking of limitless exploration and a constant evolution of skill and knowledge) that Xur's in town!!  ^ ^

I guess probably the shortest way to answer this topic is to say that Arkham Horror (and specifically the LoTR designer's presentation of it) is what got me IN to LoTR the LCG.  So while it may not be easy to get ahold of it's certainly not impossible.  When talking to a friend about it (since he really IS a fan) he didn't even know it existed and showed immediate interest.  So I think it still has a lot of untapped potential and that there is room for both it AND the Arkham Horror LCG especially with the departure of the GW license which, to be honest, I kind of mourn.

Yeah - so much this.  I go to game shops pretty often, and I didn't hear about this game until just last year.  I'm certainly not going to stop playing when Arkham comes out.  I can do both ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

I don't think there's an overlap of the themes. Yes they are both cooperative LCG, but Cthulhu versus Lord of the Rings ? Lovecraft versus Tolkien ? Gothic horror versus epic fantasy ? I know friends of mine who like one and not the other. As for me, I love both and I am quite happy to have two games to have fun with both universes instead of just one.

 

But yes, the question remains to see if the two games will continue being profitable enough for their publisher to continue developping new contents for both of them.

 

I haven't read the full 17 pages of this thread. Did anyone from FFG came to post some official comment about this ?

An evening where you play a scenario out of LotR LCG, and then play Arkham Horror LCG sounds perfect to me.  I dont think one has to replace another.  We know the theme is entirely different, and I would imagine that the play experience will be entirely different as well.

I've now been able to play both games and there are very significant differences between the two besides just theme.  I enjoyed Arkham when I was playing and finished with the campaign over the weekend with Skids.  I'll go back and try the other investigators soon.

 

Sunday night, after I stopped playing Arkham and I was watching football I found myself deckbuilding... for LOTR!

I don't get why is there still any kind of discussion going on about it. The games are NOTHING alike. It's like saying Game of Thrones is going to be closed because of Netrunner. People speculating about it are either trolls, or simply oblivious to how at least one of these games works.

As a (former) tester for both lines, I played some sort of 300 LotR games and some 50-60 games of Arkham Horror in the last 12-18 months, and I concur with what said about. AH stems from the experience and the errors done with LotR, but they are two different games. Starting from how you build your deck and ending with the raw structure of the campaign (levelling up, decision affecting long scale development of the story and so on), the two games are different.

 

Then, of course, they both have cards, and they both have a coop mechanic, and cards have a resource cost to be paid, but being this a coop LCG, some sort of common ground must exist, right?

 

Enjoy these fine games, folks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Not to pad the post count for a topic that is kinda off topic... but I just played the Arkham Horror LCG for the first time today, and it just might re-focus my gaming away from LOTR LCG towards AH LCG.  The deck building aspect is almost completely removed, and there is a stronger connection to the character you are playing, which makes this a much easier game for the mainstream audience.  Existing players may stick with LOTR, but new players may go for AH.

I want to thank the community for this thread -- it drew my attention to the Arkham Horror LCG, so I picked it up and I'm really enjoying it!

## 344 [Bullroarer Took on November 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220464-is-the-arkham-horror-lcg-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2508928)

So I've managed to get a few games under my belt and I've got a feel for the game. As Julia said, it does correct some of the mistakes of LOTR - WP dominance is the big thing, but sphere balance in general. The game is much less "virtual" than LOTR in that locations a not some far off place, but rather next door or at least nearby - which I like. It doesn't punish the combat player for having to pass a "travel" test to move on. (Well usually at least.)

But, but, there is an element that comes from the lore that means that the stories don't really end. There is not a sense of winning or losing the quest. There are multiple "resolutions" and that may be fine for some, but it just doesn't sit well with me I guess.

This game is more about success or failure of the overarching story, except that you can really screw yourself on the first quest with regards to the overall resolution by your initial choices. That's how the game is designed, and that's fine if that's what you want. I'm still not sure. I remember how imbalanced the LOTR core w and so will give it the first cycle to be sure, but for anybody that cares, AH is a very different game.

I am curious, is there a lot players in LOTR LCG that don't enjoy the deck building aspect?

 

I am more of a 1v1 TCG player, so for me deck building is the biggest draw beside the IP itself, and I always thought other than IP this game would be more attractive to the game TCG/CCG players.

 

And I still haven't given up the idea of making this game somehow competitive 1v1 yet, especially now that we are getting Harad heroes and allies. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I like the deckbuilding. I just don't like that I have to deckbuild for every specific quest. It's almost impossible to have a viable deck + sideboard that can go through any arbitrary quest. When I want to play LOTR, I want to be able to sit down, pick a quest, and go. Not have to pick a quest, then build a deck, then go.

I never deck build for quests and have decks that are viable against more or less any quest except a select few or the most difficult ones. I too love the deck building aspect but would hate if I was forced to build new decks for each and every quest.

For me it comes down to - I like LOTR - I like deckbuilding - I like multiplayer games.

I have friends who I like to play with who are 1) Not invested in the game, so they build only out of my card pool.  This can make some decks a challenge as we may both need the same cards. 2) don't like / aren't good at deck building, relying on me to build the decks and scout out the quests before hand so that I can show up with decks ready to play.  3) Don't enjoy the experience of failing a scenario, then breaking down decks and modifying them to play the scenario again.

This is the sort of question that could use a poll on BGG, but for the record I don't particularly like deck building. The way I do it is to have 8 decks permanently set up (Gondor; Gondor/outlands; Dunedain; Sindar; Noldor; Ents/Halflings, Dwarves, and Rohirrim). I then play a game and afterwards tweak the deck as necessary. I find having to continuously create decks just too fiddly, and prefer to make decisions in-game really.

 

AH LCG sounds much better than LoTR LCG in many ways, but I'm not amazingly keen on the theme.

What do you mean the box is awful?

 

The 2 core thing is a given honestly.  You want a lot of cards?  Got to buy two cores.   Can the game be played - successfully - with just 1 core? Absolutely.  However, with the split sphere deck building, it does mean you can make fewer decks.  But that should be a given since you are nearly doubling your card pool when you get the second core.  I think people are forgetting how you need THREE cores of LotR if you want a play-set of every card, and then you have trip sets of some really terrible core cards.  The same 3 core policy is in their other games as well if I recall, so 2 cores is a big improvement.   If they got it down to just 1 core, then the core would be nearly twice the price and would then lower the number of people that initially get into the game.

 

With two cores, you can build 3-4 decks.   If you build a Skids deck, I don't see there is enough good cards to balance out a Roland and Wendy deck since Skids can utilize the best from each sphere.   Wendy and Agnes can be build near mono-sphere and do really well.

Sloth - Your post indirectly channels something that's been bugging me. There IS deck building in AH - a significant amount in fact. I think people who are saying "there is not as much" are deluding themselves because of the small cardpool that currently exists. In LOTR we need a minimum of 17 different cards in our deck (50/3) while in AH we need 15 different cards (30/2). Not that different. Also in AH there is the XP upgrading at the end of an adventure - which doesn't occur in LOTR.

Browsing through arkhamdb.com I am already seeing different approaches to deck building for the characters and your point about Daisy and Agnes is spot on. Folks, there wasn't as much deck building in the early days of LOTR either.

I think the deckbuilding lack comes into play when changing scenarios. Usually you'll earn 5-7 XP between scenarios, meaning you get to swap out and upgrade 2, 3, maybe 4 cards - so not a whole lot changes. In LOTR, you generally need a sideboard of about a dozen or more cards, and you'll be swapping out a good number of them between quests. One might require Condition control, the next you swap those out for Willpower boosts, the next you swap those out for a Siege quest, etc. I'll agree there definitely is deckbuilding in both, but in AH, once your deck is built, it's supposed to be fairly stable for an entire cycle of 8 scenarios.

The two game are just different. I enjoy the two but for different reasons :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

IMO, deck building in AH is simpler than LotR primarily because you get 1 investigator instead of 3 heroes.  In LotR, there are so many different synergies between heroes as well as between spheres.  In AH, you are basically just building around spheres.  You'll never get the crazy combos like Elrond/Gandalf, Sam/Pippin/Merry, or even Theodred/Aragorn in the core set.  Obviously LotR has a bigger card pool, but you can make far more varied decks in the LotR core than the AH core.

I like the deckbuilding. I just don't like that I have to deckbuild for every specific quest. It's almost impossible to have a viable deck + sideboard that can go through any arbitrary quest. When I want to play LOTR, I want to be able to sit down, pick a quest, and go. Not have to pick a quest, then build a deck, then go.

I often feel like this too which is why I make lists of my best decks for each quest in a notebook.

So if I want to just play Lots without thinking about decks I'll pull out a deck/quest that I made a note was really well balanced and then all the game is about the deal and how I play it.

New unplayed quests usually need me to deck build, which I do enjoy, but not always.

I don't think you are right about "never getting the crazy combos" because - while the spheres you are allowed in AH are tied to your investigator - there is really no reason to believe they won't make some investigator that can have cards from multiple spheres.  

 

As for building out of the core - sure, you could make some varied decks out of the LotR core - but they would generally be pretty bad.  There really wasn't any room for creative building in LotR (especially with 1 core) and still have an reasonable expectation to complete a quest.

 

AH is a more simple deck-build process, for certain.  The deck is smaller, you currently can only use two spheres, and only 2x of each card. No disagreement here, but I don't dislike this aspect.

 

In LotR, you often needed a side board to deal with quests as you moved on.   The upgrade system IS your side board.   Spend your XP to switch out that Condition control, etc, as needed.  Some people mention they like to build a deck and keep with it throughout - well that is honestly what AH is all about.  You build your deck, then take it to the following stages, and using your XP to upgrade cards or access your side board.   I'm not sure what the actual complaint is since it seems it is delivering exactly what you want.  Please explain further.

My point was that in LotR you have the combos related to you deck and combos related to your heroes.  In AH, you only have combos related to your deck.  If you just run the math on the number of different decks you can make, LotR inherently has more (not counting for the larger card pool).

I love deck building but l still don't enjoy (nor do I actually do it) building a deck for every individual quest. That's just way too time-consuming and for me not the enjoyable kind of deck building. The fun is very much in trying to build that one deck (or maybe two or three) that can beat through almost all quests, and then just charge blindly into a quest and enjoy the surprise (I think I have it now). The downside is most easier quests tend to be a cakewalk, but I find it a good way to enjoy the storyline with leisure. My other deck-building fun is to build thematic decks for saga quests, and that is actually a MUCH more difficult and time-consuming project than simple power decks lol.

Absolutely.  However, with the split sphere deck building, it does mean you can make fewer decks.  But that should be a given since you are nearly doubling your card pool when you get the second core.  I think people are forgetting how you need THREE cores of LotR if you want a play-set of every card, and then you have trip sets of some really terrible core cards.  The same 3 core policy is in their other games as well if I recall, so 2 cores is a big improvement.   If they got it down to just 1 core, then the core would be nearly twice the price and would then lower the number of people that initially get into the game.

Hi Sloth

 

Compare the boxes to Pathfinder Card Game or Thunderstone for example - large boxes that come with internal trays that allow for efficient card storage. Nothing directly to do with the game per se, but nonetheless it makes things much easier.

 

There are endless complaints on the Arkham and LoTR forums of BGG regarding the need for multiple core sets. Where reviews are marking down Arkham it is all to do with the fact that you need more than one core to make some decks. FWIW I do understand your points (I have 3 LoTR core sets for example) but there's no doubt that this model incurs additional expenses on players because you have to purchase additional cards that you don't actually need.

 

I don't want to seem that I'm only complaining by the way, so these points need to be seen in context. I love LoTR LCG, and Arkham sounds very good.

I completely agree it is a pain to get multiple cores, especially because of the wasted cards, but I guess since my first card game experience (besides dabbling in Magic about 20 years ago) was with FFG's AGoT 1st edition LCG and you had to get 3 cores with that.  Then Lord of the Rings (3 cores), Then netrunner, starwars and Conquest (in no particular order).  I honestly can't remember if you needed 3 cores from Netrunner or Conquest but the point is, FFG's card games are the only ones I've really been involved in or exposed to, and so I take the extra core business with a grain of salt, but I accept it none the less.   

 

How much do those cores for Pathfinder or Thunderstone cost btw?

 

A MUCH better system would be if they would release a "companion core" (something I've suggested since first getting into AGoT) that would fill out your card pool without adding in extra sets of encounter cards, tokens, investigators and their person specific cards, or the basic weaknesses.   Those are all now excess garbage cards that just take up space.  So yea, that part is frustrating.

It's hard to compare like with like because there are other differences with the games - it's not just box design. For example Pathfinder has a lot less art. However, taking all that in to consideration, the FFG games are cheaper:

 

Pathfinder Curse of the Mummy is considerably more expensive: Paizo are selling it for $59.99 (I can't stand the game by the way!).

The Pathfinder Adventure Card Game: Mummy’s Mask Base Set includes more than 500 cards and 5 polyhedral dice.

 

Thunderstone Base is an older game with around 500 cards and some tokens but it does appear to go for around $60. Maybe $50 if you're lucky. I do enjoy this one, but it's nowhere near as good as LoTR.

 

Releasing a companion set would certainly make a lot of BGGer's happy! I suppose it's all to do with BGG people only being a small part of the market, and FFG have probably looked at the economics of such a move and decided it's not worth it. Plus if I'm being cynical, obsessives will swallow their ire and just buy more core sets anyway as both you and I have done.

100%.  

 

I've no idea what it would actually take - at a production level - to make the "companion core" that I suggest.  Considering that you need 2 cores to have enough tokens (or threat dials in LotR) for a 4 player game, the "companion core" would still need to include some amount of cardboard inserts and not just a collection of cards.  It's nice to think that it should be a simple matter of taking their existing card prints and redoing the layout of the print sheets to exclude all the unncessary cards, get those printed and get any extra cardboard things printed.  Get everything bundled and into a new "companion core" box, that they will need to design, etc.   It does sound easy, but that is time and money that they have to invest in, and sure, the "companion core" would sell well.  BUT - would it sell any better than a second core already does without the additional investment from FFG?   I'd guess not.

It's really about designing a core game around the ~$40 price point, which is what I assume FFG's marketing team has determined to be the optimal cost for an unplanned purchase.

I still like the idea of the first deluxe actually being a second core, with duplicates of whatever cards were 1-ofs in the first core but not of anything that already had enough for a full play set. Then you can pick either core set to get started, or buy both for a full set with no waste.

A second core for LotR would need a LOT of Gandalfs to be the true 4-player add-on most of us wish for :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I really like the idea though. Two dials and some extra tokens (you probably don't need a full set of all the tokens), and who knows how many cards. I think it would have a much higher card count than the core though, making it a fairly pricey thing. A compact box with no rulebook would be doable, if FFG were so inclined.

 

It's not without precedent either in the gaming world, with Dominion's two upgrades (the first being just an art upgrade for the basic cards).

 

A lot of the issues we (the whiners who would like more complete boxes) have are really caused by FFG being a board game company who like to sell a complete experience initially, rather than splitting up games into components and letting people pick and match.

 

If I were to make a game like this I'd sell it by sphere, with player cards (say two decks worth for each sphere. resouce tokens, 6 heroes, one threat dial, repeat card counts for each cycle), and quest sets being separate products. A whole cycle worth of quests could be one large box. It might not be a smart decision, but it would be my ideal distribution method ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The LotR core was so bad from a player card standpoint that I refused to buy a second, let alone a third. (You only get eleven cards from that third box I think someone said.). The AGoT box on the other hand was brilliantly done. I can only quibble about the extra Put To the Torches. I bought three and didn't feel cheated. AH being a coop game was always going to have about half the cards being superfluous if you bought a second core, but other than that I thought it was well designed and I bought a second.

The idea of a core expansion set is nice and all, but so is ice water in hell.

We played our first game of AH yesterday with 3 people using 2 cores practicing with the standard decks.

But roughly mid game we already saw that 1 or 2 more cores would make us that much stronger.

By being able to add the better extra 0-2 level cards the other player used in a cutsom made deck instead.

These cards were now taken however.

However, the questions are: was it doable? Yes. Was it fun? Yes. 

So imo, it's a choice; as you don't need it to play.

But if you are willing to spend the money to be stronger: go right ahead.

FFG is a company, and companies tend to want to make money.

That's just the way it is.

Here's a consideration:

With the marvel legendary games, a lot of the expansions come with a stack of black cards. When I asked why it was for production reasons. Essentially for some reason (maybe the sorting, maybe the minimum print runs, maybe just the negotiated printing deals) is actually better financially for upper deck to print packs with blank cards in. Everybody accepts it.

So if you imagine with your second LotR core you are getting a bunch of blank cards for printing economy BUT they are actually printed as spares. ... then it's not so bad :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

True it doesn't stack up at all for a third core lol where only about 12 cards are gained.

The blank cards in Legendary are a lot more useful for custom cards though ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I bought one AH core and wished for another for xmas. Pretty much the only gift I mentioned (by sending the link once a day for a while) to one family member. Problem solved for that game  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

LotRLCG feels just fine with one core and the collection of cycles I have. AHLCG seems less casual (disregarding the vast number of expansions both will have), in that it almost requires players to have their own sets of cores and deluxes. LotR is safe from this tentacled new upstart.
