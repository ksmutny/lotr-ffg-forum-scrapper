Hi, I want to know when can we view the rules of this game? I'm very interesting on this LCG.

Thank you for answer and goodbye!!

 I don't know, but we're about to get a new preview in a couple hours! Wednesday is LOTR LCG day!

They released Warhammer LCG rules a month and a half before the game came out, so it seems like we should have gotten them by now but I think that they had to hype the Warhammer game a lot more than this one since we're all so eager for this! So they might have released the rules sooner. I'm hoping things are going to start ramping up soon for a February release.

A Feb release would be awesome *just in time for my birthday* but to be honest I'm not expecting to see it until April.

End of Feb is what my FLGS has told me. I hope so cos I want to get my grubby little paws on this ASAP.

I hope they upload the rules today!

I am not exactly sure how it plays from reading the cards so far.  I am very curious about the scoring system.  (I love the Marshaling Point System from MECCG).

I am also curious about the Quest Deck/Scenarios.  (I hope they are flexible and not just a fixed goal)

I think we would all love to get our hands on those rules!!! Chomping at the bit...

But here is my question, if supposedly what I've been seeing a release date from various forums as April, we probably wouldn't see these rules for awhile if that is the case. Right? Just guessing here...but I hope that isn't the case...

My bad!  I thought it was Feb.  So that is why I was expecting the rules very soon.  Especially since they covered all the spheres of influence.

I would guess we still have a few more previews, like something focusing on enemies or the other heroes available. Or since like you said with the influence, now they can give a few examples of cooperation between the different sphere decks.

Sweet! Thank you! I hope someone will let us know if there's anything interesting on any German sites as well!

Aber ganz im Gegenteil, Deutsch ist generell viel nützlicher als Französisch! gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Anyone knows when we can expect next preview of the game? After translating this french articles to english i started to feel relentless hunger for new data about it.

Also polish distibutor of this game stated today that if the current esitmate of time the printout will be finished is correct we will get the game by the end of March :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

I know, i know - as long as i do not see the game on my desk it is like visiting oracles that is oversmoked with tabacco but... any info is better than none :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, they usually are releasing the previews on Wednesdays (each LCG has a different day of the week). They were doing every other week which means that on the 26th we should have gotten a preview so I was pissed when we didn't get one, but hopefully this wednesday it'll happen. I just preordered the game from my local game shop and their info said the release would happen some time in February, for what it's worth. I'm going to stay optimistic for now and believe in February!

The french site has third part of preview for all of us to read or translate:

This time we get an interesting insight into the flow of each of the seven phases of the round :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I would not count it as something very interesting, but for all scratching for any info the french site has new insight into the heroes - unfortunately so far we read about the ones we know

There are good news from the forum of the German publisher:

Next week there will be an event at Burg Stahleck in Germany where a complete box with the final rules will be available for demo play. So, new infos should be forthcoming.

## 18 [BeardFan on February 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/40741-rules/?do=findComment&comment=426168)

I will be at this event (Lure of MECCG) and get my grubby fingers on this game. Should be the final game (although "home made PnP") and the final rules of the German edition.

I will post my experiences and hopefully be able to answer some questions after the event.

 I've been told not to spoiler on the international forums (eg here or on BGG). Sorry that I can't answer all your burning questions here.
