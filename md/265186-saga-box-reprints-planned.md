Anyone know if they will be reprinting the saga boxes? I stopped playing around "road darkens" and have recently been thinking of getting all the saga boxes but I can not find them in print anywhere.

I don't see any reason why not; they seem to have been keeping up with all of the other reprints so far, and Land of Shadow is currently listed as being "On the boat".

Check https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/]

"The Treason of Saruman" and "Land of Shadow" as well as "The Hobbit: Over Hill..." are all "On the boat" or "Awaiting reprint".
