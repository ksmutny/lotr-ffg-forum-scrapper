very interesting…..and you know what i was right!…..didnt i say…."look everyone, i know you're all thinking denethor, but its certainly going to be Hirluin The Fair.." haha, yeah i know, complete rubbish

anyways, it wouldnt feel like a spoiler if i didnt ask this…..piccy spoilers anyone?

Oh yeah I remember!!! Nice Rich! And btw I wanst thinking Denethor.

Interesting… not where I thought they would head with the Hero… but some intruiging possibilities!

If this "spoiler" is correct, then Aragorn can become a one-man rainbow BEAST… lol.  Here's a scenario:

Aragorn (core leadership) + Celebrian's Stone (gives Spirit icon, +2 willpower, restricted) + Ring of Barahir (gives Lore icon, +1 health for each artifact) + Horn of Gondor (gains resource when character leaves play, restricted), Sword that was Broken (every character +1 willpower).

That would be an attachment heavy deck for sure, but you'd end up with Aragorn with 9 health, 5 willpower, 3 attack, and 2 defense.  He would also boost all of your other characters willpower, and gain a resource every time another character left play (which would nicely fuel his response to ready after questing).  On top of all that, he could spend resources on Lore, Leadership, and Spirit cards (throw in a Steward of Gondor for an extra 2 resources each turn, and ****)… and with that new "A Good Harvest" free neutral event, he can purchase Tactics for good measure… lol.

Personally, unless I was running him with a lot of Tactics allies (for the extra willpower), I would drop the STWB, which costs 3 resources, and include the SoG.  That still leaves him with 8 health and 4 willpower, a crap-ton of resources per turn, ability to quest and ready every turn…

If everything went right (as always, it's only as good as the cards you draw), this would be a pretty decent Secrecy setup.  Add a Tactics hero to him, run with just the two of them…. I'm thinking Hama.  Aragorn quests, readies, and defends.  Hama attacks and recycles.  With the ring providing lore access, Aragorn pays for healing, card draw, and threat reduction (from spirit), plus all the non-tactics allies…  Find a way to boost his defense a little bit (Arwen and Dundain Warning) and you've got your questing and defending tank all rolled into one…

Those of you interested in the artwork for Hirluin the Fair should check out this page [http://anthonyfoti.deviantart.com/art/Lord-of-the-Rings-TCG-Hirluin-the-Fair-370245404], which interestingly just went live 4 hours ago. It's an awesome picture and really captures the feel of the character. I can't wait to get my hands on this AP.

Little disappointed it wasn't Denethor, but Leader of Blackroot Vale Archer is acceptable too.
In fact, I think I like that FFG is using little-known figures that faught valiantly during War of Ring.

Surprised to see Ring of Barahir isn't Leadership like other Aragorn artifacts,
That Resource Event seems useful when used with Wealth of Gondor so you can play 3 cost card on first turn,
or with Leadership Boromir who are likely to have 2 Resources during planning phase if he saved 1 Resource for his ability last turn.

Cannot wait till I actually get these cards…

Edit: a 0 hp ally? I guess now we know card's passive effect takes place immediately when a card enters play, otherwise that ally could never be in play.

I'M HYPED HYPED HYPED! Wow, those cards look amazing! I like the fact that this was the "outlands" pack. They should do this kind of thing more often, really adds consistency!

And I like Hirluin a lot! Finally we're getting lower threat heroes. I knew it wasn't going to be Denethor, lol. Looks interesting, and I like pretty much every player card in this pack. As I said, I'm hyped.

I cannot wait to make an outlands deck.  Making Hirluin an absolute beast with all those allies is going to be fun. Already thinking of other heroes to match him with.  A very good tale is going to be a must have in this deck just to get all those guys in play ASAP

I must say, however, that as much as I like the cards so far, I am dissapointed by the fact that the Outlands characters do not have also the Gondor trait. Why is that? Doesn't make sense at all.

Can you imagine leadership boromir with 3 of those tactics outlander allies in play although??  The rest of those allies would have +4 ATK…that would be gnarly.  It would have been nice to see a little cohesion between the two of them however.  It is still possible however to play them both together unlike two different traits like dwarves and nolder.  For example, a Hirluin, leadership boromir, and Beregond deck would be very competitive in the HoN quests

Maybe that is 'the' hero for Gondor, give Gondor trait to Outland characters and Outland trait to Gondor characters.
Denethor, Imrahil, or Faramir that can interchange Gondor/Outland trait while certain conditions are met (ready, have resource, under certain threat, over certain threat, remaining HP, enaged with X enemies, minimum threat of X in staging area, etc.)….. or would that be just too powerful?

The cards seem amazing. It is hard not to think of an Outlands deck right away. So many of them are good, but how about Mithrandir's Advice in a mono-Lore?

I'm still not sure about the exact wording on some of these. Pics would be most appreciated.

And as for the Gondor-Outlands synergies, I think it is bound to come. Hunter of Lamedon is already there. But I am thinking more of an event. There is Mutual Accord combining Gondor and Rohan, there could be White City Call Leadership 0 cost event doing the same as the above for Gondor and Outlands.

Same here.

While the Outlands cards are nice, Gondor got shafted so far. I know that Outlands make sense, but come on. It's like having a Silvan-themed AP with most of the cards being Sindari. Now I hope that we'll get at least something like Mutual Accord for the Outlands and Gondor.

 

As I have said in another thread, the whole Gondor expansion is a dissapointment for me so far.

I think that this was simply the Outlands AP. It's pretty much guaranteed we'll see a proper Gondor themed AP soon enough, and hopefully with a Mutual Accord for Gondor and Outlands characters.

I don't think that this cycle will be that much Gondor focused as expected. Probably, many Gondor cards will be left for a future "Return of the King" saga box.

Nah, by the time we get to the Return of the King, they will be expanding Middle earth way further than just making the "basic" cards for a faction such as Gondor. We'll be having powerful Gondor decks a lot earlier than Return of the King.

Well, just got my order in for The Steward's Fear and a bunch of the unlimited FFG card sleeves from my fav online hole-in-the-wall site…

Anxious to put together a deck where Aragorn pretty much does everything by himself… lol.  There'll be questing, defending, attacking, healing, threat reduction, card draw, action potential, treachery and shadow cancelation, location control, etc, etc…  In thinking of what kind of a title I should give such an amazing deck, I settled on the simple:

"Aragorn".

lol… in all seriousness, that ring is gonna make him ridiculously good! (cuz he wasn't already)

He needs Anduril (reforged) to either boost his attack or lower his enemies defense and obviously give him the tactics icon !

I'm probably in the minority here, but I don't like that Aragorn got plenty of toys with bonuses specific for him and other heroes feel so…..neglected. I know, he is a hero in the books, but these stories are before them, so he is just a strider/ranger/whatever.

 

If we got some proper non-race specific (Dwarrowdelf axe, Rivendell blade) non-situational (Blade of Gondolin) weapon attachment. No, Spear of the Citadel doesn't cut it.

Who is everyone thinking of teaming Hirluin with??  Thinking about some possibilities:

Elrond: can help pay for any of the 4 colored Outland allies, Vilya can help play them faster, gives access to lore sphere for card draw

Bilbo: instant draw advantage and lore sphere, but having two statistically weak heroes to start the game would be difficult

Boromir (tactics): provide some necessary strength in the early game from his multiple action potentials. Thematic too. Throw a gondorian shield on him and he can stave off all the enemies until Hirluin is up and running

Theodred: any additional resources on Hirluin will be super advantageous to get those allies out ASAP. A second leadership hero allows first turn access to steward of Gondor too.

Aragorn(leadership): serves same purpose as Boromir but slightly less desirable because of him using up a resource. Late game he can pay for multiple spheres with his attachments both old and new however 

who else you guys think?

For a time I have been thinking of a Leadership Gondor deck. Now you can use Boromir, Théodred and Hirluin for a hybrid sort of Outlands deck. But I do see a good combo in using Tactics Boromir. Also one can have Beregond as an early defender. The problem might be the early questing in such a deck. Elrond and Glorfindel shouldn't combo badly with Hirluin and the Outlands swarm, Imladris Stargazer could be a nice addition to Hunter of Lamedon, for instance.

Actually, I'm not sure you are in the minority… I think most of us would love to see some "attention" spread around to other heroes/races/etc…  I do love Aragorn as a character in the books, but even though I joke about making him this huge hero in the game, I really wouldn't mind if they focused elsewhere for a bit…  But since they DID give him all these toys already, I'm definitely going to try them out…

And no, I wasn't meaning that all he needed was just the ring… lol.  But using that ring all of a suden makes all those other attachments that much better.

yeah, i had thought the shafted zigil will be no good but with stargazer, he can still be quite effective, even the one resources can make a distance and the acceleration through the card draw is very nice in general

I like that they split Gondor into Outlands and Gondor (because the world is huge), I also think that diversifying the card pool with extra traits is a good thing.

I hope that eventually a way is worked out to split the super powerful dwarfs up. Since most of their strength comes from the fact that so many cards share a trait.
 

(I am aware that they could have been split into different types from the start, based on the lore, the way elves were. However I can't see FFG wanting to errata every dwarf card to add the types in now).

Not sure if I like some of the art. Don't get me wrong, the artists are obviously talented and the technique is excellent, but I didn't picture the herdsman who gives hitpoints and who carries his cane around his sheep and that has 0 strength with a huge sword hanging from his belt, or a regular soldier from the outlands carrying such a big axe around, and that plague-doctor guy bugs me somehow… I'm nitpicking I guess, but some of the art seems a bit "dispropotionate" to me. The rest is completely awesome though.

So excited for this AP! I'm already a HUGE fan of Hirluin.  He's only 8 threat! If you can get those outlands guys in early, he can become a monster with low threat.  He could become better than Spirit Glorfindel.  Also as a side note, this is the first hero that has Ranged and isn't Tactics! Other than Aragorn, only the Dwalin ally has a sentinel and isn't tactics…. At least I'm pretty sure. (Correct me if I'm wrong) Maybe we'll start seeing those keywords spread around to the other spheres.  And, Hirluin can be customized to fit whatever role you need him to be. For example, if you needed him to be a attacker, you could include the outlands guys that boost attack.  Of course, putting all the outlands together would be more effective, but if you needed more room in your deck, that could be an interesting solution.  cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]

Actually, scrap the part about the plague-doctor. Just looke up the name Telemnar to learn that he was a king of Gondor who died of a certain Great Plague after a short reign in the third age. Guess that now the art makes a little more sense, I had thought that the design had been developed from scratch.

Sorry to correct you…. Outside Tactics these are the Ranged/Sentinel characters:

 

Lore:

Aragorn has Sentinel

Haldir has both Ranged and Sentinel

 

Spirit:

Dwalin has Sentinel

 

Leadership:

Aragorn has Sentinel

Silverlode Archer has Ranged

Dunedain Wanderer has both Ranged and Sentinel

 

In tactics we have 5 heros and 7 allies that have Ranged or Sentinel… None of them have both.

 

So it is "weird" that the fighting sphere hasn't any character with both Ranged and Sentinel?

Woops. I guess I… Overlooked those guys. XD That is true though, it's odd that none of the tactics allies have both keywords.  But, I guess they gave guys like Haldir and Dunedain Wanderer both for a reason. If Tactics allies had both, most of the time the extra keywords would go to waste, because a lot of tactics allies specialize in one group of fighting.  Such as Vassal of the Windlord or Horseback Archer. They can attack across the table, but if they had sentinel, you wouldn't use it. But guys like Haldir can do everything fairly effectively: Quest for 2 willpower, attack any enemy with 2 attack, or defend against any enemy with 2 defense. I guess if they made tactics characters that were that well-rounded with both keywords, they might be too strong.

Haha yeah. Definitely describes what kind of things I can overlook… I try to analyze every situation, but then miss something that would have drastically changed the game.  mono [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/mono.gif]mono [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/mono.gif]mono [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/mono.gif]mono [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/mono.gif]mono [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/mono.gif] What the heck.

Now this is funny:

Knights of the Swan have the Outlands trait, yet their leader (Prince Imrahil - AjtR) has the Gondor trait. I get that when Imrahil came out, the Outlands trait didn't exist, but come on.

just played all the HoN quests tonight with my roomate and realized after beating Peril in Pelagrir I allowed my roomate to attach "Cram" to my Beorn throughout the game…whooops

best part was he was the one that realized it.  He tried healing my Beorn with his Warden of Healing during Into Ithilien and i explained how Beorn could not be affected by any player cards.  He then asked why he could use "cram" in the previous quest….

@ klaymen:

I thoight the same thing. But I guess one could reason that Imrahil is related to the ruling families of Gondor (if I remember correctly), while the knights of his following are of the land he rules. Hence the different traits.
