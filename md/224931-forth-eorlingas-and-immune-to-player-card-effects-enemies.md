# [Forth Eorlingas! and &quot;Immune to player card effects&quot; enemies](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/)

## 1 [sappidus on July 14, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2308826)

I'm just logging this here for the record...

This came up after someone realized it's possible to have maps in Temple of the Deceived that are impossible to win (fantastically unlikely but a cool little discovery, check it out here [https://www.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/4sby9y/impossible_map_for_temple_of_the_deceived/]). In brainstorming ways to get around the map lock, someone else brought up using Forth Eorlingas! to attack the Temple Guardian, which says:

 

Combat Action: Each Rohan hero can be declared as an attacker against enemies in the staging area this phase.

It kind of seemed like Forth shouldn't work, as the Temple Guardian is Immune to player card effects, but it wasn't actually completely clear to me that Forth Eorlingas! doesn't work the same way that Quick Strike does: make some sort of modification to the declaration of "framework" attacks. Since Immune enemies are (of course) still susceptible to framework attacks, maybe Forth could work...? (As per the FAQ, Hands Upon the Bow cannot be used against Immune enemies because it forces targeting/choosing of the enemy. Note that this bars Dunhere and Haldir too.)

 

I sent in an official query to get the final word, and here's what I got:

 



> The distinction between Quick Strike’s effect and other similar effects is very subtle, so I understand the confusion around the different rulings. Basically, Quick Strike only works because it allows you to attack an enemy that you could typically attack. It just changes the time at which that attack takes place. The reason that effects like Hands Upon the Bow and Forth Eorlingas! do not work against enemies that are immune to player card effects is because you can’t typically attack an enemy in the staging area.

 

So all remains sane. (Except perhaps the fact that Quick Strike does work at all against Immune enemies, but that's another discussion...)

Mmm, what about Haldirs action?

Basically what you have to remember that one use of Immune to Player Card Effects is to stop enemies being attacked until the designers want you to be able to. Therefore it'll be immune to any shenanigans effects like Haldir, Dunhere, Hands upon the Bow. Quick Strike is an exception because it isn't a shenanigans effect, it just lets you strike first when you're already in combat with someone.

 

You can try to wrangle the rules mess into something that makes sense to you if you want, but I don't see any point, because the designers will just rule in this way every time. Even if they secretly agreed your logic was correct.

I think Dunhere is a legal option to attack an enemy in the staging area which is immune to player card effects. Because Dunhere only expands his attack-area, when he attacks alone.

The surest way to remain quasilegitimate when pulling off shenanigans in this game is to never ask for a ruling, heh.

 

That said, Immunity specifically prohibits Dunhere's ability...

 

> Additionally, cards that are immune to player card effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card effects. This means that any player card that uses a form of the words “target” or “choose” cannot choose a card that is immune to player card effects as its target.



(In fact, I believe that at the time this was added to the FAQ, the only player card that used the word target as a verb at all was Dunhere.)

 

Haldir, on the other hand, is an interesting question. Staging-area attack is out, but personally I assumed you just couldn't use his ability even if an Immune enemy was engaged with another player. Then it was pointed out that in that case, Haldir's Action could be seen as just declaring a Ranged framework attack slightly out of sequence (cf. Quick Strike), which the Immune enemy should still be vulnerable to. While it seems a touch against the spirit of Immunity to me, I can't see anything wrong with that logic -- never submitted an official query about it, though.

So any Immune to player effects card is also immune againts a player card that mention any eligible target or ennemy?

So making a ranged attack against an immune enemy is legal? I think 'ranged' is only a word for an effect, which allows the character to target an enemy engaged with another player (same as Dunhere in the staging area) ... im confused?

I don't think Haldir's ability is legal against immune to player cards effect...

> So any Immune to player effects card is also immune againts a player card that mention any eligible target or ennemy?

 

Remember, Quick Strike works against Immune enemies, despite being worded "Exhaust a character you control to immediately declare it as an attacker (and resolve its attack) against any eligible enemy target." So the presence of the word "eligible" is not a good heuristic to evaluate for a card's applicability in Immune situations. As the FAQ puts it for this situation (p. 13), "...the chosen enemy's immunity does not factor." (Again, I consider this one of the most counterintuitive rulings in the game.)

 

Now consider the wording of Haldir: "Combat Action: If you have not engaged an enemy this round, exhaust Haldir of Lórien to declare him as an attacker (and resolve his attack) against an enemy not engaged with you." This is very, very similar to Quick Strike -- if you can come up with an argument that separates the two in this situation, I would love to hear it.

 

Otherwise, let's take the FAQ again:

 



> Q: What counts as a “ranged” attack?
> 
> A: A ranged attack is an attack made by a character with the ranged keyword against an enemy engaged with another player.

 

And elsewhere:

 



> A card that is immune to player card effects can still be affected by normal framework effects such as placing progress from questing successfully, engaging an enemy during the encounter phase, or dealing damage through an attack made by a character.

Let's throw in the Core's definition of ranged:



> A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players.

So this is the putative reasoning:

 

* Trigger Haldir's action, declaring him as an attacker against an Immune enemy engaged with someone else.

* Per the above FAQ Q/A, this counts as a ranged attack.

* (???) Per the Quick Strike stuff, it counts as a "normal framework effect" even though a player card Action is involved. To wit: look at Caleb's explanation in the OP of this thread: "Basically, Quick Strike only works because it allows you to attack an enemy that you could typically attack. It just changes the time at which that attack takes place." Haldir's ability, when used against an engaged enemy, can be also be viewed as simply changing the time when a typical attack takes place.

* Thus, per FAQ 1.47, the Immune enemy can still be damaged by it.

 

The question-marked step is the vulnerable point to me, but I do think it works.

 



> So making a ranged attack against an immune enemy is legal? I think 'ranged' is only a word for an effect, which allows the character to target an enemy engaged with another player (same as Dunhere in the staging area) ... im confused?

This highlights the only other weakness in the above argument I can see: someone contending that Immune enemies are even immune to ranged attacks. Are you actually arguing for this, though?

If Dunhere is not allowed to target immune enemies in the staging area ... yes, then ranged should be handled the same.

I'm not sure how "ranged" factors into this discussion.  I agree Haldir's ability wouldn't work against an immune enemy, but Haldir's ability does not say it is a ranged attack, nor would it fit the core definition of a ranged attack against an enemy in staging and engaged with no one.  Any ranged character, Haldir included, should be able to use the ranged keyword to attack immune enemies engaged with a different player, just as any sentinel character could defend against immune enemies engaged with a different player..

I don't think Ranged matters, since that is part of a standard type of attack.  Ranged doesn't create an extra attack, or extend attacks.  Just like Quick Strike, Ranged simply lets that character participate in another player's engaged attack.  You still only get 1 attack per enemy, so Ranged doesn't create a 2nd opportunity, it just allows them to participate in the attack of another player.

I am thinking that Caleb's distinction between QuickStrike and Hands Upon the Bow/Forth Eorlingas is dubious at best. This feels like a bad ruling/policy.

 

These cards modify the Player capabilities, but the player is still making an attack, and attacks work on immune characters. I think the cards should work.

 

Note, Quick Strike changes when we can attack, but not who (and works on immune).

Ranged changes who we can attack (and works on immune).

Hands Upon the Bow changes who we can attack and when, but for some reason cannot work?

Forth Eorlingas just changes who we can attack, but for some reason cannot work?

 

That set comes across as somewhat incoherent. In all cases, the change seems to be made to the player or player-cards, not the immune card. This should go down fine (much the same way that you can prevent damage to immune characters, because the thing being affected isn't the immune thing).

 

I think life would be much better if they both worked just fine (and if deemed necessary were errata'd to preserve 'current' behaviour/limitations).

Alternatively, I would be content with a rule/ruling that attacks initiated by card effects are considered card effects (which stops QuickStrike as well as Hands/Forth).

 

But the current arrangement is making me sad.

It's worth noting that the original ruling was that Quick Strike and Hands Upon the Bow both worked on Immune enemies. Caleb only later reversed his ruling to the one active today. So he actually switched into this state of affairs.

Got a long mail form Caleb - will attach it later, when home.

 

Short abstract ... Ranged and Sentinel work as normal against/with immune enemies. Effects, which let you attack an immune enemy in the staging area are illegal .. such as Haldir, Hands upon a Bow, Forth Eorlingas and probably Dunhere (Dunhere wasn't directly mentioned in the mail..)

 

So, if Haldirs effect, when attacking an enemy engaged with another player is illegal .. i don't know, haven't asked this.

Looking forward to JanB's full response. Meanwhile, here's what I got from Caleb:

> The ranged and sentinel keywords are abilities that affect the character they appear on, so an enemy'S immunity to card effects does not prevent you from using those keywords. You can use a sentinel character to defend an enemy that is immune to player card effects when it is attacking another player, and you can use a ranged character to attack an enemy engaged with another player too.

(For reference, even though the FAQ nowadays makes his case clear, Dunhere is explicitly mentioned in this ruling: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1086021/official-ruling-dunhere-hands-upon-bow-and-enemies [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1086021/official-ruling-dunhere-hands-upon-bow-and-enemies] )

You can't typically attack an enemy engaged with another player either.

Those two rulings seem contradictory.  Ranged and Forth Eorlingas! both definitely affect the card and not the enemy and neither uses a form of the verb target.

 

I'm just going to assume cards like Forth Eorlingas! and Hands Upon the Bow do use a form of the word target and call it a day.

A character with Ranged is typically able to attack an enemy engaged with another player.  That other player does not need to initiate, or participate in the attack.  It is still only 1 attack per enemy, but a player with ranged could initiate the attack on an enemy engaged with another player and this is by the framework of the game allowing a ranged character to attack an enemy engaged with a different player, not by any ability.  Which I think is the distinction here.

 

If it is a framework attack, then you can do it.  So you can use Quick Strike to make an attack against an enemy who is immune to card effects so long as that attack goes by the game's framework for attacks (engaged with you, or ranged engaged with another player) but no card ability such as Dunhere, Haldir, or Forth Eorlings would work because they are changing the nature of the framework attack.

 

Of course - if the card is not immune to card effects, you can use Quick Strike to have Dunhere attack an enemy in the staging area during the Quest phase.

I'm not sure it is worthwhile to argue what a character can and cannot typically do.  That's a mess.  But I'm curious...

 

1.  Would you say Eowyn could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player?

2.  Would you say Eowyn with a Dunedain Cache could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player? 

3.  Would you say Eowyn with Forth Eorlingas! could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and is in the staging area?

 

Bonus (and I'll even answer this one for you :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]): Can one typically understand LOTR LCG rulings surrounding immunity to player card effects?  No!

 

Edit: The truth is, we know how they are supposed to interact now, because we've asked, so that's good.  But it is seemingly contradictory based on the current rules we have.  They could easily come out and say why Ranged is different and why it is special, but it doesn't matter why in my opinion.  The why will most certainly be something arbitrary (like what you've stated regarding what a character can and cannot do "typically").  Arbitrary/one-off rulings are not helpful for players because they cannot be applied to future, similar situations.

If we changed "ordinarily attack" to "make an ordinary attack", I think a clear distinction can be made between ranged and Forth Eorlingas!  A ranged character makes ordinary attacks against engaged enemies, they can combine with other players, there is no distinction made by kind and number.  With Forth Eorlingas! they are not ordinary attacks, they are attacks against enemies not engaged and they are restricted to Rohan Heroes only.

 

However, Quick Strike is also enabling a non ordinary attack, since it's restricted to a single individual.  So it's not just a matter of being an "ordinary attack" which would exclude Haldir/Dunhere/Great Yew Bow.

 

So I think the invisible "target" is the most coherent explanation.  Engaged enemies can be attacked, immune or not, which means that anyone who can attack an enemy engaged with player A (which includes all ranged characters for B/C/D) can attack an immune enemy.  Enemies in the staging area (who aren't considered to be engaged) can't ordinarily be affected, so any cards that lets you attack them necessarily requires using a card effect to target that enemy -- and that's where the immune kicks in.

 

I think it necessarily follows that if there is an immune enemy in the staging area *that is considered to be engaged* with the Dunhere player, that Dunhere can get his +1 attack if he attacks alone, since the bonus affects only Dunhere and is conditional solely on where the attacked enemy is.  Given the defense on such immune enemies, that's probably not very useful.

While I essentially agree with cmabr002 that it is often fruitless to quibble about any effects surrounding Immune enemies, I still want to register disagreement on this point. Dúnhere is worded:

"Dúnhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone. When doing so, he gets +1 Attack."

i.e., he only gets his bonus when "targeting", which the FAQ says he cannot do to the Immune enemy.

## 26 [dalestephenson on October 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2482463)

A reasonable interpretation.  The FAQ says not that immune enemies can't be targeted, only that they can't be targeted by player card effects -- you *can't* attack an enemy, immune or not, without targeting it, but an immune enemy *can* be targeted for an attack if they are engaged, even if staging.

 

So the question then becomes what the "when doing so" means on Dunhere's card.  If it means "When Dunhere targets enemies in the staging are and attacks alone", I think it should qualify.  If it means "When Dunhere *uses his ability* to target enemies in the staging area and attacks alone", it definitely doesn't.  And rethinking this, I agree the latter is more likely to be the intent of the card.

You can build up several super high attack strength heroes with lots of attachments that grant attack bonuses, such as Gondorian Fire and The Black Arrow. Since the Host’s engagement cost is 50, an event like Unseen Strike can help in a pinch.

Thanks JanB, and I think that enforces what I was saying.

 

cmabr002 - It is not a grey area to talk about what a character can and cannot due.  While this game has a rocky rules element that often causes us to seek clarification, I think this one is pretty clear.  There is the game framework, and there are character abilities.  The game frame work allows a player to attack an enemy they are engaged with, or with ranged to attack an enemy engaged with another player.  Same with sentinel.  This is by the game framework, and is not a card ability.  Just as dealing damage is a game framework effect, so you can damage cards that are immune to player card effects, because the damage is not a card effect but a framework mechanic.

 

Quick Strike has been ruled to allow a framework attack - meaning you could make an attack from a character you can make an attack with, against an enemy they could attack.  Forth Eorlingas, Hands Upon the Bow, ect all apply a player card effect which modifies the framework attack to extend it to the staging area.  I see a clear distinction between these two things now.  Ranged and Sentinel aren't card abilities, they are traits of a card which dictate their framework interaction, but Haldir's ability to shoot the staging area is a player card effect, because it is an ability on the card which adds an effect the basic rules of the game don't have.

 

I'm as much for a comprehensive rules document, with as much errata as needed to give us a clearer, more consistent game experience, but I think in this situation it is pretty cut and dry.

 

edit - 

 

1.  Would you say Eowyn could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player?

- Eowyn cannot typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player because you can typically only attack an enemy engaged with you when you don't have the ranged trait.

2.  Would you say Eowyn with a Dunedain Cache could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player? 

- As Dunedain Cache gives the ranged trait - and ranged character can typically attack an enemy that is engaged with another player - Eowyn with DC can attack an enemy engaged with another player that is immune to player card effects.  The card effect that gives her ranged effects her, the framework extends her ability to attack an enemy engaged with another player.

3.  Would you say Eowyn with Forth Eorlingas! could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and is in the staging area?

- Forth Eorlingas applies a player card effect to create the ability to make an attack into the staging area.  As this is a player card ability that does not follow the game framework rules for attacks, you cannot attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects.

 

Bonus - Tactics Eowyn is definitely one of the best cards in the game.  Which quest would you recommend to get the most use out of her +9 attack for 1 turn with say, Path of Need in play on the active location?

So the newly spoiled Oath of Eorl works against immune enemies as well? It seems it is just the same as Quick Strike.

I think Oath of Eorl would certainly work, since it doesn't target enemies at all, merely alters the order of operations within a phase.

Yeah, this looks like Oath of Eorl will be legal against immune cards, again the reason is because it isn't changing who you can attack, or how you can attack, only when you can attack.

Well, the designers get the final official say on all matters, but I'm going to have to deny any correlation to the actual text.  There is little consistent wording between these examples.  Sorry, Matt and Caleb.  I love you guys, but the explanation really doesn't clear this up.

Dunhere's ability is passive and does NOT target enemies at all.  It clearly says that Dunhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks.  It is altering his ability to perform a normal attack.  On the other hand, if it read "Choose an enemy in the staging area..." then I could understand the immunity.

Forth Eorlingas could go either way, since it also does NOT target enemies, but just modifies the framework.  Saying that characters can be declared as attackers against enemies in the staging area does not target the enemies.  But I can accept that the designers simply intend it that way.

Hands Upon the Bow uses the targeting as part of its effect.  It does NOT "allow the character to target", but rather directs the player to target the enemy, hence the immunity would apply.  Haldir's effect is structured similarly.  Unfortunately, Quick Strike's wording is almost identical.  Relying on the logic that an eligible target indicates a "normal" attack versus whatever other kinds there are is to read more into the text than is there and without the foundational consistency, we're just reduced to requesting a list of card effects which are affected by immunity and referring to it as we play.

Long term, this is one area where the designers should focus on to develop a consistent vocabulary as classic M:tG did long ago.  In that game, the term "target <cardtype>" always indicated a targeting whereas broad, general effects did not trigger immunities.  

Just for the record, as a rule, Matt and Caleb are knocking this game out of the park (in a good way), so take this as very constructive criticism from a big fan.

> Dunhere's ability is passive and does NOT target enemies at all. 

 

I always thought that they wrote this passage in the FAQ specifically for Dunhere, whose card uses the word "target" :

 

"Additionally, cards that are immune to player card

effects cannot be chosen as targets of player card
effects. This means that any player card that uses a
form of the words “target” or “choose” cannot choose
a card that is immune to player card effects as its
target."
 
Dunhere and immunity never really bothered me, but the identical wordings of Quick Strike and Hands Upon the Bow always did.  Quick Strike should not work against immune enemies.

Certainly there isn't any correlation to the wording on the cards.  They tried that, and like some other things... they had to change their stance on it again.

The only question you need to ask is "If it were attack phase, and I had no card effect in play, could I attack this target"  If the answer is yes, then you can use a card ability to initiate that attack.  If the answer is no, then there is a player card effect in play, and the targeted card is immune.

 

This is the only way that works consistently with the printed cards, and allows the quests and such to work "as intended."  This basically just allows Quick Attack to work, but if there is any other card effect which works like QA where it simply allows the attack to happen, but doesn't change anything about what that attack would be, then it would also work.

The problem with this statement is that Ranged is a card effect.  So it's not so simple.  Thankfully, the developers cleared that up for us by telling us Ranged and Sentinel are not affected immune despite being card effects.  What Distractionbeast said is true although I think it would be easier to move forward making a list of effects that are not affected by immunity and to just assume everything else is until told otherwise.  Although, that still requires us to ask.

In summary (due to developer clarification):

 

1.  Quick Strike, Ranged, and Sentinel are NOT affected by immune. 

2.  Additionally, damage cancellation and resource pools are eligible to be manipulated even if that character is immune.

3.  Immunity does not apply while out of play, although the victory display may be an exception to this rule (not sure)

Ranged is not a card effect.  As discussed before, Ranged simply invokes the game rules which dictate who can attack who.  I think it's pretty easy to see the difference between Haldir's Ranged keyword, and the ability he has to exhaust and target an enemy not engaged with you for an attack.

Ranged and Sentinel are both described in this area.  Also you can see the difference easily on cards, as they are always separate from any ability text.

You should probably edit the bold part.  To clear up your mistake, I've edited it for you in the quote above.  As I said before, the developers have cleared up this interaction for us (between Ranged and Immunity) so we can move forward, but to say it is "cut and dry", clear, or any other such similar word, is just being disingenuous at best.

Haldir can attack immune enemies if they are engaged with him (framework attack) or another player (ranged framework attack).  He cannot use the action printed on his hero card to attack immune enemies.

Asked Caleb about Haldir's action - if it considered as a ranged attack when attacking an enemy engaged with another player:

> Quote
> 
> Hi Jan,

> Haldir's effect targets an enemy. Enemies that are immune to player card effects cannot be targeted by player card effects. Therefore, an enemy that is immune to player card effects cannot be targeted by Haldir’s effect.When Haldir uses his effect, it is not considered a ranged attack. Ranged attacks are described in the core rules under the Ranged keyword. When a character with the Ranged keyword declares an attack against an enemy engaged with another player via the Ranged keyword, that is a ranged attack. When you declare Haldir as an attacker via his ability, that is different.

I just wanted to clarify: Oath of Eorl can be used to attack "immune to player card effects" enemies engaged with you before they attack?

That card basically change of the normal order of the framework step of the round, so yes. The normal declaration of an attack against an enemy during the players attack step of the Combat Phase is part of the game framework and you can choose eligible "immune to player card effects" enemies. Note that this still doesn't let you attack immune enemies in the staging area with let's say Dunhere or Forth Eorlingas (but you can combine Forth Eorlingas/Dunhere and Oath of Eorl to attack non-immune enemies in the Staging Area I guess)
