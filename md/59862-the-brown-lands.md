 I just came across a situation that made me realise I may be playing wrong during the Travel Phase.  What happened was this:

I had two copies of The Brown Lands in the staging area, and an active location.  I competed the quest and got rid of the active location.  I then traveled to The Brown Lands.  Because it says "Forced: After the players travel to The Brown Lands, place 1 progress token on it." I put a progress token on it, thereby completing it, and discarded it.  Still in the Travel Phase I repeated with the second copy.  Is that right?  Did I do anything wrong there?

 You can't travel to 2 locations in a single Travel phase.

Good question, I had to look at the wording of the rules to confirm it. On page 15 it says "During the travel phase, the players may travel as a group to any one location."

The key word is "one", so I'm pretty sure that you played it wrong this time.

But it was only one location - The Brown Lands. He just explored them very thoroughly. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

 

Seriously, of course he played it wrong.

 Ah yes, reading the rules you're right, only one.

So correctly you would put the token on the location and complete it next turn?  or complete it this turn and travel to the new location next turn?

You complete it once you've put enough progress tokens on it. So you can discard Brown Lands the very moment after you travel to it.

gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] Because no one wants to go to the brown lands more than they have to, and ESP. Not without a plunger!!!

There's a reason they call it The Brown Lands sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif].

 On a similar topic, what happens when a location has enough tokens on it due to Northern Tracker?  Is it explored or do you need to wait until the travel phase to make it the active location and immediately discard it?

 It is immediately considered Explored and discarded.

 ok good, I was hoping that was the case.
