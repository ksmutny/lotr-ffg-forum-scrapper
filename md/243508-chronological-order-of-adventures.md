If I were to try and put the various expansions and adventures from the LCG into chronological order in terms of the Third Age calendar, would this be right?

------------

Hobbit Saga

Core Set / Shadows of Mirkwood

Khazad-dum / Dwarrowdelf

Heirs of Numenor / Against the Shadow

Voice of Isengard/ Ring-maker

Lost Realm / Angmar Awakened

Grey Havens / Dream-chaser

Sands of Harad / Haradrim

Lord of the Rings Saga

-------------

Where do the POD adventures fit, chronologically?

Well, The Old Forest and Fog on the Barrow-downs sit into the LotR Saga.   And the Battle of Lake-town goes into the Hobbit saga.  

As for the rest, I suppose they fit somewhere between the two sagas, without any clear indication from the developers where.  And by the way here is a nice article about the Siege of Annuminas which talks about the chronology at one point: https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/siege-of-annuminas/ [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2017/01/14/siege-of-annuminas/]
