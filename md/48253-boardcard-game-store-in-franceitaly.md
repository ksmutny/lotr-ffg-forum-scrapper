Hello, all.

I need some advice.

My girlfriend is going to travel to Paris-France and Rome-Italy and I would like to know if there is any card/board game store there that sells the Lord of the Rings LCG in English? As I live in Brazil, I would like to ask her to buy there to save with shipping costs.

Â 

Thanks to all.
