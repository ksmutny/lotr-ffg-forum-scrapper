One quick question. Lets say that the current quest has the Battle Keyword.

I play Ravens of the Mountain event card. The revealed card is a Southron Company card.

Would I add 1 or 3 progress tokens in the quest? 

 

I ask because the Southron Company gets +2 threat while the current quest card has the battle or siege keyword. But the Southron Company card is not in play while I am  revealing it with Ravens of the Mountain, so what about its passive ability? 

 

The more general question is: Are passive abilities of encounter cards (that affect their stats:

Threat, Attack, Defense and HitPoints) in effect while these cards are in the encounter deck?

I have been playing it so Southron Company does not get a bonus in this instance.

With the argument that the card is not used as it´s inherent type.

Don´t know if this is how it is supposed to be handled though

The card's text applies only if the card is in play or otherwise explicity noted.

Cards you are looking at are not considered in play because they are still considered in the encounter deck.

And cards that are in the encounter deck are ruled to be out of play. Just in case...

This was how I also played it.

What about X? Do you resolve the value of X or do you assume 0?

To complete Glaurung statement, from FAQ (page 7):

 

(1.40) The letter X
Unless specified by a card effect, or granted player choice, the letter "X" is equal to 0.

But most X's are specified by a card effect. Mostly I'm wondering about a passive effect because other types of effects obviously aren't going to active.

If the card is still in the deck, all of its card text is inactive, unless explicitly stated otherwise.  This includes the card text that defines "X."  So while the card is still in the deck, it lacks text to define "X" and you will treat it as 0.

Ok. That's what I figured, but I've played games where that wasn't the case. In those games, the definition of X was "game text", not "ability text", so it was always active.

Well, how could gandalf's search or stand and fight X would resolve then ? (with other card than ravens of the mountains, of course)

You have to be coherent and either treat X as 0 when the card is not in play, or find a solution for all cases. Just imagine a location that read "turn the first card of the encounter face visible, X (the threat of this location) is the threat of this card". Boom, infinite loop. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

(and then developper add the text "... even while this card is not in play" :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])
