In Land of Shadow saga exp, first quest called "The Passage of the Marshes", there is a Soft Mires location. At the end of the round, any card with Mire keyword gets 1 resource token and is discarded (I assumed into discard pile, not victory display). "Soft Mires" has "Mire 1" so at end of round, I put 1 token on it and discard. It's trigger is to draw another encounter card. When I do, the new card also has a "Mire" keyword.

 

Do I put a token on it, or has the "place 1 resource token on each mire location" step passed? I'd normally say it's passed, except the rules say when a card has an X mire resources, you immediately discard it, which maybe hints you do each location one at a time. So maybe the step hasn't passed yet and it should get 1 resource token? Not sure.

Don't place it on the new one.

What's your reasoning? Has it been ruled this way? Or is there precedence for it in some other ruling?

It's previously been ruled that you do not resolve a Forced effect if its trigger occurred while the card with the Forced effect was not in play. So, say at end of round you are forced to reveal a card, then the revealed card has a Forced effect which triggers at the end of the round.  You wouldn't trigger it because the revealed card was not in play when the trigger occurred.

 

Mire is not a Forced effect, but I imagine it would follow the same logic.  The Time keyword, as well.
