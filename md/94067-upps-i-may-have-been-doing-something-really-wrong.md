Till this morning, considering the Archery keyword in the game, I had thought one should never exceed the number of hit points of a character when assigning the damage. But when I was rereading the insert, there was no such thing. So I take it you can just give all, say 20, damage to an ally with a single hit point? It would have made things much, much easier.

 

As a side question, has it been made official if the Prowl mechanic takes place before or after "when revealed"?

i also thought this- you keep assigning damage much like the cave trolls ability, and it overspills.

i will surprised if it is different as it will make it much easier

Since damahe assign one by one you cannot assign all 20 damage to one ally. And if you can do it so archery idea lose any meaning.

Prowl should happen before when revealed effect but im not sure. Should be answer in rule sheet with AP.

Archery Official Response:

Damage from Archery keyword cannot be over-assigned to characters you control. It must be divided among characters you control until either there is no damage left to assign or no characters left to assign it to.

The damage is applied simultaneously, so you can assign damage to more than 1 Silvan Refugee because their Forced effect will not trigger until after all the damage has been assigned.

Cheers,

For consistency with surge, doomed and other keywords, I've been triggering prowl and underworld after the when revealed has resolved. I asked this on BGG but never got any clarity on it, so this is the way i play it.

I think keywords are before 'when revealed' triggers

I'd say:

 1. Continuous abilities (Thalin)
 2. When Revealed.
 3. Keywords.

This is all in my faq : http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92338-unofficial-faq-compilation-of-answer-from-around-the-web/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92338-unofficial-faq-compilation-of-answer-from-around-the-web/]

 

Keywords are considered passive :

 

> FAQ item 1.37 addresses the order of resolution for effects. Passive abilities (such as keywords) come first. Surge is a special case because the rules for the keyword indicate that the extra card should be revealed after the card with surge. With regard to Star in Sky, the players would first resolve the Prowl 2 and then resolve the When Revealed effect.

Good to hear, so I was playing it correctly. I must have missed the one-by-one aspect this morning. No damage done then (save by the archery), and it makes sense.

This rule makes sense intuitively and thematically as well: why would archers keep shooting arrows at a dead character?

Yeah, to answer this thematically may not be clear, I am sure a volley often kills with much excess. But as for mechanics, the excess would simply make the keyword little important.

I've always thought that Archery damage is assigned one by one. Haven't got that far into Númenor/AtS yet, but I'm sure it'll be fun. (One of my decks was accidentally nicked by a friend and mixed with his own cards, and we haven't had the energy to do something about it.)
