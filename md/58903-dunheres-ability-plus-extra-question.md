# [Dunhere&#039;s ability (plus extra question)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58903-dunheres-ability-plus-extra-question/)

## 1 [cordeirooo on January 13, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58903-dunheres-ability-plus-extra-question/?do=findComment&comment=578999)

Hello!

I'm new on the forums (and the game) so I come here most humbly ask for your knowledge.

 

 

I'm really torn about Dunhere's ability, I'm not sure it is great, good or so-so.

It says (and I paraphrase): "Dunhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone. When doing so, he gets +1 ATK."

The way I see it, Dunhere is able to attack an enemy that is not engaged with any player (thus, have a higher Threat than any player - ignoring exceptions) during the Combat Phase after all your enemies attacked. 

I believe this is correct because it uses the words 'can target' and 'when he attacks [...]'. Well, one can only attack during the Combat Phase, so, the logical conclusion is that he can only attack an enemy with higher threat (again, barring exceptions) that is not engaged, thus being in the Staging Area.

 

What I heard from a more experienced friend, is that his texts allows him to ignore the restriction of attacking only in the Combat Phase, which I wholeheartedly disagree, since there is no specific text saying 'during the quest phase' or anything similar. He pointed out the Golden Rule for me, but it seems to me that he is stretching the purposes of the GR a little bit.

 

Another thing that I'm not sure is, can I play Sneak Attack dropping Gandalf paying only 1 (Leadership) Resource?

I couldn't find any reason to why not, but it seems way too powerful for me, specially with a 2-cards combo.

 

One last thing, can I pay a Leadership Attachment with Gloin and attach it to Legolas?

he cant attack anywhere but in the combat phase unless you use quick strike or a card like it.......

when you have bought sneak attack you can use it as normal...you buy it for one cost, then the hero you chose is free....remember its only for one phase though....so he cant quest, then stick around to fight etc

......yes, you can pay for an attatchment then give it to a sperate sphere hero

I'm relatively new, also, but I have some opinions and some answers.

(opinion) First, I agree that Dunhere should only be attacking during the combat phase unless you have a card that allows you to attack at another time because it states, "when he attacks alone." I think if it were an any-time ability it would say "Action" before his ability. Since it doesn't, the only time you could attack would be during the combat phase. 

(answers) The answers for the other two questions are both "yes." Yes, you can use Sneak Attack with Gandalf, and it becomes really useful in more difficult scenarios. Yes, you can play attachments on any character as long as you don't break the prerequisites. For example, some say play on a hero only. If it doesn't have a sphere restriction, you can attach your Leadership card to Legolas.

@Budgernaut

Hmm, your opinion is actually a very good way of explaining why he can only attack during the Combat Phase. 

 

Thank you both, Budgernaut and richsabre for your quick answers! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

 

 

One last thing:

The location Old Forest Road says that you ready a character after you TRAVEL there. This only happens once, right? When you decide it is the active location, or am I wrong?

yes when you actually travel there you ready one character, and this is it. obviously if you draw it  from the encounter deck again and travel to it  you get to ready a character again

Correct me if I'm wrong but I think the new dwarven axe can only be used by dwarfs

 And the Rivendell Blade goes to noldor or silvan characters only.

Really? This is news to me. The Rule book (p4 - SPHERES OF INFLUENCE) says "A hero’s sphere dictates the types of cards that hero allows a player to use."

Unless i am interpreting this wrong, I assumed this to mean that Hero's or Characters in General could only use cards that were in their sphere of influence. Unless you played a card that would allow them to use other sphere's (a song card for instance).

You are saying that, as long as I pay for the card using the right sphere resource, I can play the card on anyone?

firstly i dont know how to double quote so to the above two comments- yes im sorry you're both of course right....im not sure what i had been drinking when i posted that....however referring back to my point he is very powerful buffed up with other cards

to the above quote- yes you can use cards that are bought on other spheres- unless of course the card states otherwise.....the above two points are good examples as is fast hitch- which says attatch to a hobbit character....now that card is a lore card but as long as the character is a hobbit then its ok...so it can go on frodo for instance who is spirit, protector of lorien is another good example of this- lore card, bought by lore resources....but can go on any sphere

burning brand however is an example that restricts to lore characters

Yes, you are interpreting this wrong.

"A hero’s sphere dictates the types of cards that hero allows a player to use."

The hero's sphere determines which card you, as the player, can play. It does NOT dictate WHERE you can play those cards. Essentially, what this is saying is that you need a hero of the matching sphere to play the card, but when it comes to attachments you can play it on any eligible character in play. Unless the card specifies on what you can play it, you can play it on any character.

I think the card reads "Attach to A Hero"..there is a bonus for dwarves but, you can play it on any hero.

no worries.....i think your thinking about the old core set dwarven axe....the new one is dwarrowdelf axe....which in hindsight i probably should have called it in the first place to avoid confusion!
