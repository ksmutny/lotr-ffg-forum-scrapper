Hi guys,

The rules indicate that a character needs to be ready and able to exhaust in order to quest, if a character commits to a quest (with light of valinor attached) and after an encounter card exhausts that character, would the willpower still count?

Regards,

Yes it will, unless the card indicates the character is also removed from the quest
