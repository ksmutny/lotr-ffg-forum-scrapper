With new expansion we will obtain Gandalf as a Hero. We also already get primary characters that were described in books.

Lately FFG release Nightmare Packs with the speed of light. And they never supported LOTR LCG as much as other LCGs.

 

I'm I wrong if I say that line of LOTR LCG is going to the end? With rate of releasing Nightmare Packs I would say that this game will live for one more year. Than it will become DCG and if we are lucky FFG will create another solitaire LCG.

At one point I was worried about this game ending in the near future but those thoughts are long gone. From all I've seen and heard this game is going super strong and has much more life in it. There's no reason we won't continue through all the Sagas which will take at least 2 years or 4 at the recent rate of release.

As for the Nightmares, they seem like they're getting released fast but they're not. They still don't come out till about 2 years after the original quest was released.

I think the speed of the nightmare pack releases was an attempt to catch up a bit. When they do decide to stop producing this game, they don't want to have a bunch of Nightmare packs left to make.

Rumors of this game's demise always swirl about, but it's selling really well according to the words of FFG's own CEO (as of last Gen Con at least). 4 more Saga boxes to come and I would guess plenty of cycles to continue long after the Sagas are done as well. I wouldn't worry.

The current Ring Maker Cycle is a great example of how this game can carry on even after the last saga box is completed. The developers are coming up with a rich storyline along with adventures that are completely of their own creation other than that they draw upon the lore of middle earth. There is plenty more they can probably cook up, so I'm not concerned.

One issue that might become a problem is new player recruitment, because the breadth of material and catch up seems daunting and this is just continuing to increase.

My suggestion to FFG would be to release an entire box set of a cycle in the future, so only 2 purchases need to be made after a player has the core set. For instance, They could by Khazad dum and also the complete Dwarodelf Cycle.

Not sure if that would make a big difference, but if I were new to the game and realized I could buy a whole cycle for around 50 to 60 dollars, my path to entering the game would be much smoother.

but it's daunting trying to get into any game - just try entering AGOT LCG now, for example.

based on what evidence?

 

the fact that they do make POD expansions for this game and no others? The Fellowship event exclusive quests that other games don't get? The Gencon quests that other games don't get?

 

It's absurd to claim FFG doesn't support this game. The *only* thing LOTR is missing are tournaments across the US/globe like the other games have. That. Is. It.   But, it should be noted, they have run LOTR:LCG tournaments at the FFG Game Center in Minnesota.

 

To claim FFG does nothing to support this game - when they do *more* for this game than many others - is not based on the facts.

That's PvP and from what I understand players like a particular faction and then they go and find the sets for the cards they want to build decks around, and their all player cards.

Lotr has scenarios that connect the whole cycle together so players are more likely to make a purchase to get everything just for completion of the story line of the cycle

Gandalf as a hero! Nice.

Ever since Warhammer: Invasion ended, players of the other LCGs constantly worry about their beloved getting the axe from FFG. There seems to be a consensus of opinion that if anything ends, it would be Call of Cthulhu.

 

FFG has said that the LoTR LCG is a massively and incredibly successful game for them. No company in their right mind would quit making a game that fans are buying! 

 

Also the following is very important to consider with LoTR LCG:

With games like AGoT, to have a fun experience, you need to be relatively competitive. The buy-in right now is enormous. I have been playing AGoT since the beginning, and so still play it a lot. But, if I was looking at the game right now, there is no way I would buy into it. 

 

LoTR, due to the nature of the game itself, does not and will not have a buy-in problem. The game is cooperative! So, new players right now can get on the on ramp with a core set and maybe a few APs and have loads of fun. This is one LCG where a large card pool really does not affect new players. Actually, this game might be even more appealing for new players, since they know that there is such a rich body of content already established; this is essentially the reverse of the phenomenon that happens with the competitive LCGs.

That Gandalf is sorta hax. Between him, his staff, say a burning brand and a solid defender, you are likely to roll thru most encounters with ease. The encounter cards have to be designed to counter him in some fashion.

And should we worry about the new Warhammer LCG? Seems unlikely LotR would be abandoned as long as it keeps is selling relatively well. But perhaps a swing of FFG's attention could happen, pushing the release dates of LotR expansions further to make room and capacity for the new product?

I have no special insight into FFG's business plan, but my assumption would be that since the old Warhammer was shut down, this should free up enough resources/attention for new Warhammer 40k that LotR won't be impacted too much. There will always be a new hotness LCG, as we saw with Netrunner and Star Wars, that gets the lion's share of articles and publicity and that's just natural.

Lotr is doing well. Don't forget i unique game..... Lotr is really special since is only coop deck building game in Lcg format and Tolkine theme is big + as well. So i don't see any sign of sunset. I don't really understand why you think so?

Raven and Glaurung, I think you are both right and surely there is not much to worry about. But I guess those recent minor delays in Ringmaker cycle might have made some people think that perhaps we are no longer the favourite child of the FFG parents.

Also, in my country (Poland) Lotr LCG has been shut down due to awful figure sales. But I am sure this has no bearing over the overall US and global distribution.

Btw, has anyone got sale figures for ffg's lcgs? That would be very interesting.

Live tournaments is what makes difference between "standard card game" and "collector card game".

 

And there is over 7000 miles for me to travel to Minnesota :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

The game seems to be in good shape right now, but I think it's a mistake to not have more organized play.

 

It doesn't necessarily have to be competitive in the usual sense, but something like campaign mode for Mirkwood, etc....

 

I even think they should have organized play for how to get new players into the game. Maybe 4 decks that can be built with the core set playing Easy mode Journey Down the Anduin as an example.

 

Game Night kit difficulty 9 scenarios are not a great way to introduce new people to the game.

Agreed.

On the other hand, if this is what is being promoted then perhaps just keeping the existing fanbase hooked is the purpose of FFG in terms of securing affordability of them supporting the game.

Nah. The game is far from dying. Especially with the latest cycle, the new cards are an amazing addition! Lots of clever abilities.
