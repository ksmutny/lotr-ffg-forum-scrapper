 Does anyone know if you have to actually have an active location in order to use the West Road Traveler's ability? 

 

For example... there is currently no active location, then I play West Road Traveler, can I move a location from the staging area and make it the active location even though I didn't actually exchange?

 

Thanks in advance for the response.

I can't be sure its the correct answer but I believe you do have to have an actual active location in play to make the switch (with another location in play).  If it had said you can move a location to the active location spot (instead of switch) then it would have been a different story.

I guess thematically you can look at it as the west road traveler moving between the two locations. If you dont have an active location she has nowhere to go! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 Thanks, I guess that makes sense.
