When setting up should your threat be the total of all 3 heros or just the two who you are able to use at first then add the threat of the prisoner hero when they are free?

You do your deck's setup first, three heroes, shuffle deck, draw 6, mulligan if you want, then do 1A ->1B, so you still count full threat for three heroes.

Couple questions:

 

1. In the initial setup, I drew two treachery cards to be placed on two objective cards. The first was Necromancer's Reach which I discarded without issue because nobody was exhausted. The second was Under The Shadow which I also discarded without issue because I have not started the game yet so I am not even in a phase. Were these the correct responses?

2. If I am good with how I handled #1, I now have two available Objective cards to attach to a hero. Can I attach either of these objective cards to the hero I chose as my "prisoner"?

Thanks

 1. Yes

2. No, because the prisoner is removed from the game - you can only attach cards to characters that are in play.

A question about the guarded objectives :-

If an enemy is a drawn as the guarded card does it stay attached to the card in the staging area until you engage it or will it engage with you when your threat is greater then its threat engagement cost?

Thanks

Having an Enemy guard an Objective changes nothing about what the Enemy does, how it engages. Just means you have to kill the Enemy before you can claim the Objective. FAQ changed the order of things with regard to Objective-Guard:

"A guarded objective is treated like an attachment if
guarded by an enemy or location, and remains attached
to that card until it leaves play, at which point it will
return to the staging area." (FAQ, p. 4)

vs

"Enemy and location cards attached to guarded
objectives do still count their threat while the enemy
or location is in the staging area." (p. 24)
