We don't know the hero in this pack, right? It should be tac if each sphere gets 2 heroes for a deluxe and the following cycle as always.

4 allies, right? The Spirit Dúnadan and three Gondorians. Eager to see all of them. Then there should be the Leadership event with Tactics extra effect, a nice Gondor flavour judging by the picture from the article. I certainly hope the guy with the spoilers arrives here soon.

yeah these sailing quests have been some of the best things to happen to the game in a while imo.

 

also, the Race Across Harad quest, it seems that everyone will be travelling atop their own Mumak that seem to work similarly mechanic-wise to the ships we have from The Grey Havens (except they are all likely all the same stats/conditions/etc.)

 

 

it'll be interesting to see if they ever try to revisit (and how they do it). that mumakil quest seems like a good attempt

I'm in Bradenton, FL for another week.

Can't seem to find a store online that sells lotr lcg in town.

Are there any?

I've looked on bgg, but the posts about this area are from 2007.

Not too reliable.

Sarasota & Brandon will also do, but the store websites mostly suck :/

Would love to bring home the last 2 ap's before they are available in holland.

Try having Coolstuffinc ship to where you're staying. They're in-state, so the shipping should be cheap.

 

Their actual locations (Cool Stuff Games [http://www.coolstuffgames.com/]), if you're looking to make a trip, are in Maitland, Waterford Lakes, Hollywood, Jacksonville, and South Orlando.

Don't worry I'm with you on this one. Sailing was definitely cool but fell flat for me. Really don't see myself going back to those quests very often.

I have enjoyed the sailing quests, but it just isn't a mechanic that is generic enough to be translated over to broader applications.  Things like battle/siege questing, Time or side quests can be used in just about any setting so will probably keep creeping up from time to time.  Hopefully, some of the other mechanics from this cycle will make re-appearances though... like some of the location stuff.

I kinda like sailing, but it seems that they missed the boat (so to speak) with some of the allies (like the new Gondor ally who should help with sailing, but gives the wrong ability). My main problem with sailing quests is that the boats are immune to traps and the enemies attack you directly. So a whole deck type is gone. Just when I decided to try it out. Poo. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

finally, Ithilien Archer [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_ithilien-archer-eaad.jpg] has a use!

not sure how useful it is tbh, but it's an option i noticed. it's kind of fiddly, so i haven't really tried it out yet.

i agree with your assessment about the archetype not being particularly viable for the quest, but i disagree that it's a bad thing. i actually don't agree with the 'one deck to rule them all', but now we're digressing.

i really enjoy the sailing quests. the main thing i liked about it was everyone having this ship with their own unique stats, all with sentinel, one with ranged, so they could help other players in need, and all with unique abilities to tailor towards towards their decks. like i said upthread, some of these features are represented in the Race Across Harad quest, with every player riding on their own Mumak

## 24 [monkeyrama on October 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232239-city-of-the-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2465502)

I did try the archer, but it's otherwise not such a great card. Plus I never seemed to draw it.

 

Well, yes, I don't really think there is one deck to rule anything, nor should there be. I was just sad that I finally built a trap deck and then realised my next few scenarios to play negated it. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]  The Noldor deck it's paired with goes solo on those quests.

i was being 99% sarcastic about using Ithilien Archer. i was mostly making a joke that such a useless card finally has a use, and it's still bad

Yeah, seriously, the checking of the website a few times a day feels a bit odd. On the other hand, there might be no spoilers for a while after this one. Only some announcements and then we probably wait quite a long wait before the next cycle kicks in, right? And the next saga may not be out till next summer I believe… still, the spoilers and the announcements of the last two packs, and especially the last saga would be great.

## 29 [John Constantine on October 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232239-city-of-the-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2471693)

Remembering previous times, the gap between the release of a deluxe and a first ap is huge.

Yes, that's what I meant. If I remember correctly it has always been months. This time the deluxe comes especially early, right? I think it was usually round xmas, and the first pack in mid-spring or so?

 

And what about the spoilers, haha?

## 31 [GrandSpleen on October 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232239-city-of-the-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2472087)

I think the quickest release from deluxe to the next AP was 3 months.  That was the Grey Havens (Feb. of this year) into Flight of the Storm-caller (May).

The knight is totally going in my Gondor deck. Not the greatest ability, but it's not muh of a drawback in Mono Leadership Gondor with hero Denethor.

 

Also, I'm really loving the Ithilien support.

## 37 [John Constantine on October 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232239-city-of-the-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2472279)

With Boromir, that knight is a 3/3/3/3. 

 

Overall, all those cards seem mediocre. Nothing made me go "wow!" when I saw it.

I like that lore ally.

Guardian of Ithilien is a great fail save for when a foe slips through in many cases.

Not just to tennis a enemy into a trap.

Great ally.

And not too sure yet about that lore spear really.

It does help clean ship in a trap recycling deck I guess.

## 39 [John Constantine on October 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232239-city-of-the-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2472298)

The good thing about dat Lore spear is it helps with less useful traps. Also, just imagine, that 1 cost lore ranger, with two 1 cost spears can stick a trapped enemy for 5.

## 40 [donkler on October 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232239-city-of-the-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2472371)

Ranger Spears, surprisingly effective against Durin's Bane!

 

Seriously though, I am going to put those bad boys on Haldir in a trap deck and have him go full John Rambo.

## 41 [John Constantine on October 24, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232239-city-of-the-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2472394)

More tricks for trap decks!! Woohoo!  Really like Guardian and the Ranger Spear...Just having a legit weapon in Lore is great.  Will really reduce the reliance on Song of Battle + Dagger of Westernese to Voltron up Haldir or Faramir in a mono-lore trap deck.  And the Guardian is obviously great for getting a little more deliberate placement of an enemy into a trap or setting up Haldir to plink them in the staging area.  

 

Certainly not cards for every deck, but solid additions to the archetype.  

 

I am also a little bit smitten with Sulien...Just as a card for a Dunedain deck of course!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

That Gondorian Knight of the White Tower with the rainment of war attachment goes to 2,3,4 with 5 hp. Then if you have boromir with visionary leadership you reach 3,4,4 with 5hp .... seems pretty interesting

Nice.

Of course Bow of the Galadhrim is still the best attachment for Haldir hero, but it seems more viable now to put him into a mono-Lore with the Nets and Spears. I also think the Guardian fits the Ithilien theme very well. A ranger of 1 cost is good, it seems.

The Knight is cool, obviously.

I wish the Soldier had 1 willpower. Not sure how good he can be. Well, naturally better in mono-Tactics.

I think the Guardian of Ithilien will be really good.  1 cost, non-unique allies are generally good, but especially with both the Gondor and Ranger traits.  His response doesn't really matter to me.  

 

The main thing that jumps out to me is that now we have a reliable 1 cost target for Ranger Bow.  I really like using the bows with Ithilien Lookouts because they are 1 cost in secrecy, but that is unreliable and only works in specific decks.  Now, you can run 3x Guardian of Ithilien and 3x Ithilien Tracker in your Thalin/Argalad deck and have a reliable target for your ranger bows.

 

Secondly, this pack is a big boost for the Erestor Gondor deck.  More 1 cost Gondor allies that can help get out Citadel Custodians and Very Good Tales.  I think Knight of the White Tower will go nicely in that deck as well, although I'm a little worried about his restriction.

 

I really like the Ranger Spear, with Haldir being the main beneficiary.  I think Sulien will be a decent 1x, just because she has 3 willpower for 4 cost.  And obviously, Prince Imrahil is going to be a beast.

It turns out to be a scroll of ancient Numeneorean script which translates to "The real treasure is friendship." Upon translating it, Sahir was twisted into a terrible vessel of Morgoth's power out of sheer rage.

So we basically got a pack full of Gondor cards.

Not that exciting for those of us who don't play Gondor :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 

Ranger Spear is awesome though, great to see more non-tactics weapons and I like that this one is built to work well with traps. Sulien is great and has already been put into my decks and although it isn't great for my decks Inspiring Presence is one of the best mutiplayer cards I think we have ever gotten. +2 attack and defence to all heroes in play except for one? Yes please!

Not the biggest fan of the Knight... totally thought that his text box would be something like "Knight of the White Tower gains Sentinel as long as you control 2/3 heroes with the Gondor trait" not something that is negative. That being said he is an incredible investment for 4 resources and if you put attachments on him he gets even better. We have been getting plenty of allies that are incredible cost for their stat distribution and abilities though (Glorfindel, Sulien, Azain, I would argue Fornost Bowman and Marksman of Lorien as well etc) so I don't think he is that special in that regard. It is always nice to see allies with stats worthy of a hero though.

As it is, this guy is a total machine in AVGT or Timely Aid decks, so I'm happy.

More of an Old Tobey man myself :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Perhaps too much indeed as I was definitely being way too greedy. I hadn't broken down his stats like that, 10 stats for 4 cost is indeed pretty mental.

That Lore spear is great. I get super excited because it would be a good fit in a trap deck then I realize I can't for the life of me to get a trap deck to work solo. Either building my own or netdecking, the trap deck hates me or something. Thing is, the deck archetype intruiges me. Maybe I'm just not use to that play style? Well, another card for trap decks that motivates me to try again and I'm sure history will repeat itself... >_>

i'm really loving all the newly spoiled cards from cardgamedb

that Lore spear is great for a christmas ranger deck with lots of card draw, traps, and Tactics events that require exhausting a weapon (like Foe-hammer, for more card draw)

i'm really digging the Lore and Tactics allies as well

i have in mind a crazy deck once this pack releases

well if you can get him with Imrahil, you could reduce the cost of an event you'd play, but... i think i'd rather just great a better ally for the 1 resource i paid for his ability if there is another option

i think his ability is more of a limitation rather than a bonus to try to utilise.

imagine if he were a 1-cost ally with those stats; those are pretty solid. if it were cost 2 with no bonus, it's a bit expensive.

think of the 1-cost reduction as a rebate for the ally to make it so the cost is more palatable. i don't think i'd ever really pay 2 for it if i didn't have another card to play right after

Not only against Durin's Bane.

The FAQ 1.17 states, that every enemy which guards a card is a legit target because the card with the guarded keyword is considered as an attachment.

No, seriously, why Sahir has a Corrupt trait? It has no game implication, and if we're talking theme, then he's an Umbar Corsair, he's not that honest to begin with before the events of the City of Corsairs.

 

 

P.S.: You know what would be cool? If at the end of the 4th AP  there was a conflict between Sahir and Nyashish, and you could take either side, in 5th cycle there would be both Sahir and Nyashish heroes (so you could include the one you sided with into your deck), and for 5th and 6th APs the main villain would be the one of them you didn't sided with. Sweet dreams.

So, at the end of 4th AP the one of the Corsairs which gets the Artifact gets Corrupted and betrays the party, and the one which doesn't becomes the hero. I wonder what Sahir hero would look like. He'd be a Leadership hero for sure.

There were 10 non-hero player cards in Cobas Haven, so having just 8 in City of the Corsairs is expected. (It was already done this cycle with Flight of the Stormcaller and Thing in the Depths.)

Okay.  First time through the quest and I lost on stage 1 with no progress on the quest card.  I am playing two handed and think it would be easier solo because then I would essentially get an extra ship.

So, speaking of Outlands, does Prince Imrahil + and Prince of Dol Amroth offset losing Lord of Morthond?

 

 

 

Also rules question: Does Prince Imrahil's ability activate the Hearld of Anorien's ability?  I would say no since using Imrahil's ability is not considered "play from hand"?

Carn Dum was penultimate I think?  I am using my All in the Family decks Elrond/Arwen/Galadriel & Aragorn/Elladan/Elrohir.

Beat it.  Long, long schlog.  Yes we do find out what's in the chest:  a kitten!

 

 

Not really.  But I don't know how to do the spoiler thingy.  It's a tough quest for sure, but not Carn Dum tough I don't think.  (I never played Carn Dum with these decks so it's hard to say.)  I'll certainly be playing it again.

 

So previous to this cycle I was pretty much a one handed player and I think I'm going back for the next cycle.  There is just too much to keep track of when playing two handed, especially if the decks are really complimentary.  I tried to make the Three Hunters work during all of the first cycle, but they didn't really.  Now maybe they will with the new versions of Legolas & Gimli.  We'll see.

 

Anyway, thanks designers (and playtesters) for a great cycle.  I hope the next one is as good!

i honestly don't see how. his ability isn't really all that synergistic with Outlands tbh, especially since the allies are so cheap. ideal targets are things like Beorn and other high-cost allies, people like Hama with 'discard at the end of the phase' abilities

granted, his Leadership ability isn't synergistic either, but is Lord of Morthrond is a concern, that Imrahil isn't any better or worse in terms of ability.

I have not played Outlands since 2014 but I feel Leadership Faramir is a way better fit for them than the Tactics version. And for the Prince of Dol Amroth attachment. The Tactics Faramir may be better in my Gondor deck (although the Leadership version was great too), and indeed for the power allies like Beorn, Legolas or Deorwine.

Beat Storm on Cobas Haven a week or so ago and just beat City of Corsairs tonight! Absolutely loved this cycle overall and really enjoyed the last two quests regardless of difficulty unlike the last cycle. Storm on Cobas Haven and City of Corsairs were both difficult but didn't feel unfair or impossible like Carn Dum did or Dream Realm could at times. You can get crazy starting rounds with more enemy ships than you can handle but it still never feels anywhere near as ridiculous or difficult as Carn Dum or Dread Realm.

 

Storm on Cobas Haven was a great quest and I feel like they did the Naval battle really well. I suffered almost countless losses before I could get this one under control and even the win I did eventually get was extremely close. My decks were definitely not well suited to this one and it showed big time, I did get there eventually though and although it was frustrating at times most of the games were really fun.

Managed to beat City of Corsairs by rushing the first stage as fast as possible (building up forces and feinting enemy ships when possible) and then slowly beating stage 3 over the course of several turns trying to amass forces as much as possible then battling Sahir and his corsairs over several turns on stage 4 until I was able to utterly destroy him (with 10 or so damage to spare). Really enjoyed this quest (more than Cobas Haven although the epic naval battle was pretty great) and think the way that going from sea to land is handled is really clever and works flawlessly. I definitely found it much easier to rush the first stage by questing hard and staying on course than to try and battle it out at sea and destroy the Stormcaller. If you have a clear board state when you get to Stage 3 you only have to add a resource to a few corsair enemies for not destroying the Stormcaller so there is really not much of a setback. I found that you need to consistently attack Sahir as well as other corsairs in play so that you keep his resource level as low as possible especially considering defeated corsairs add their resource to him. Absolutely loved the way the story ended and the cool backstory we got for Na'aisayah and also the backstory for the chest and its contents! Was awesome to get a tale however brief set in Numenor before its fall!

Cannot wait for the new cycle and loving this game so much right now (just recently committed to using the Galadriel hero properly for the first time ever and used her to beat City of Corsairs among several other random quests).

Agree with PsychoRoka about the difficulty of this cycle's final quests vis-a-vis Carn Dum and Dread Realm. I really enjoyed the Angmar Awakened Cycle, but never did play either Carn Dum or Dread Realm because they were so difficult and thus required specific deck building. I also happened to be really busy when they released, so between lack of time and the demands of those quests they still sit in my encounter deck box waiting to be played. I intend to try them at some point, but FFG pumps out LOTR:LCG content quickly enough for my schedule that I find it difficult to go back to old quests and stay current at the same time. I still need to play Pelennor Fields properly, am trying to get through City of the Corsairs, and have the Fellowship event occurring next weekend in my area. And while the Upcoming page says "on the boat", in the blink of an eye Sands of Harad will hit! I also work, have a family, and enjoy plenty of other table top games. So yeah, the whole time thing. What's the phrase - time is the fire in which we burn? But I digress. I thought the last two Dreamchaser quests did a solid job of balancing challenge with play-ability.

 

On a side note, I think my favorite experience in Storm on Cobas Haven was flipping over the Corsair Skirmisher. Loved that after you defeated it, you could pull it over to your side.
