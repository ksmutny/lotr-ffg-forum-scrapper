Over the last few days I have been working on some improvements to the LotR game engine in OCTGN to make it easier to play.

Details can be be found here [http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=529], as well as links to download the updated files.

I love the changes. Move discard to deck is great. And the additional deck is perfect for so many quests.

 

 

Love all but one thing…….. could you bring back the map background. I find the new background much more disturbing while playing.

 

Thanks.

I agree on the backdrop but I have a nagging feeling we could do better than the original.

Anyone got some good LotR images that could be used as a suitable (but not too distracting) backdrop image?
