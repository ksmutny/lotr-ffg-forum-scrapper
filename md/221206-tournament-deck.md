Hi, I've been playing for about a week now using the core set. I'm using a two sphere 40 card casual deck that was recommended at a site. My question is when is it ok to use a 50 card 'tournament deck'? Can I use one for the three scenarios in the core set or would that be considered cheating? I ask because I'm finding the second scenario very difficult to complete. Thanks

Technically, you should be using a 50 card deck for even demo scenarios, but it's hard to justify it with only one core set. Until you get a few more packs, keep playing with the 40 card demo decks. Or make proxies of cards you want to try out from later packs and sets.

Ok, thanks for that!

I have also been playing about a week but am only using the four 30 card single faction decks that come with the core set -- I am also having trouble with the Anduin scenario with these decks (6 straight defeats so far).  Can you point me to the source for the 40 card deck?  I only have the core set at present.

hallofbeorn.wordpress.com. I finished the Anduin scenario with a forty card leadership lore deck. Keep trying and you'll get there. Escape from Guldor is even more difficult solo but it can be done. I watched a guy on YouTube do it in about 15 mins. Good luck!

Liesesss all of it liesesss! EfDG is impossible to solo and you know it.

Still it haunts me in the darkest hours of the night. Taunting me in my dreams until I wake with a jerk covered in salty beads of shame, then falling asleep again to the sound of my own crying. It can´tsess be donsess I tell you.

He also admits he got extremely lucky in staging the first few turns as well as in setup. He also chose Denethor to get captured instead of doing it at random.

Also known as CHEATING ;-)

Well, he's using Spirit Glorfindel+Light of Valinor. Not exactly available to someone with just the Core Set.

Journey along the Anduin (JaTA) is beatable with a 50 card deck with just the Core Set. I struggled with it when the game first came out, but now coming back to it (even with just core set cards) I find it to be very easy with the right deck, to the point of never losing.

 

Here is a tournament legal deck you can try: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/961/seastan-s-single-core-set-solo-2.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/961/seastan-s-single-core-set-solo-2.0]

 

If you read to the end of the description for that deck you can see some of the tips for playing JaTA.

 

There are some other JaTA-related tips in my video tutorial (this is two-player, but I talk about a few tricks in the video that you can use for solo play, like playing Faramir+Ever Vigilant to clear stage 2 in one turn).

thanks for that. I've actually beaten JaTA now but I'm after skipping EfDG after a couple of games as everyone says it's almost unbeatable solo.
