 So I'm still pretty much brand new to the game, but I'm starting to try customize my own deck. Problem is I don't really have any idea of how many of each type of card (ally, event, attachment) to include in the deck. Any examples I could get of decks (especially tactic alone or w/another sphere) that seem to work for the three core scenarios would be much appreciated.

To beat the Anduin for instance, try Dunhere with Eowyn and Legolas. As for cards to use: The Galadhrim's Greeting, A Test of Will, A Light in the Dark, Unexpected Courage, The Favour of the Lady, Dwarven Tomb, Northern Tracker, Feint, Quick Strike, Blade of Gondolin, for instance. If you own the expansions, do most of the Spirit Allies, Westfold Horse-breaker, Escort from Edoras, The Riddermark's Finest, and also Winged Guardian, Descendant of Thorondor, Beorning Beekeepers, and cards like Borne Aloft, Ancient Mathom, Ride to Ruin, Musterring the Rohirrim. It could be fun.

And if it is, I can give you some other tips.

Instead of Legolas, you may also try Imrahil, he comboes well with the Rohan deck. Valiant Sacrifice, Sneak Attack, Snowbourn Scout are good Leadership cards there. And I had before forgot to mention Ancient Mathom perhaps which comes naturally with cards like Ride to Ruin or the Riddermark's Finest.

 The rulebook says that a tournament eligible deck has to have a minimum of 50 cards. Is there a disadvantage to having more than 50 cards? Are most decks you guys are playing that size or bigger?

I play with a deck somewhere between 50 and 60 cards typically. The advantage to a smaller deck is that what you get on a given draw is less random. If you have a 100 card deck and need a Gandalf, your chances are much lower than finding one in a 50 card deck.

If you aren't worried about making the most uber deck ever, I wouldn't worry too much about deck size. I'd recommend not going TOO large, but no need to always stick to 50 cards exactly.
