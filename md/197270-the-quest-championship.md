# [The Quest Championship!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/)

## 1 [jjenks476 on December 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1962541)

This was inspired by the Hero Championship, which I wanted to emulate to see what were people's favorite quests.

SO, everyone who wishes to participate will vote on their top 10 favorite quests, out of all the ones available. Favorite can mean, best designed, most thematic, most fun, great difficulty level, whatever criteria you wish. The quests with the most votes will make it to the first round of voting where 2 quests will be directly paired up, and everyone votes on 1 or the other. Eventually we will make it to our top 3 where you will vote for 1st 2nd and 3rd place. If you vote for the Nightmare version of a quest I will just count it as if for the regular one. 

 

The 3rd round of voting is up! 1-10-15

 

1. Wastes of Eriador vs. Flight to the Ford

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Seventh Level

3. Fog on the Barrow Downs vs. Massing at Osgiliath

4. Helms Deep vs. Encounter at Amon Dun

5. Foundations of Stone vs. Stewards Fear

6. Three Trials vs. Siege of Cair Andros

7. Journey in the Dark vs. Battle of 5 Armies

8. Druaden Forest vs. Journey Down the Anduin

 

 

The 2nd round of voting is up! Just copy and paste, and choose your favorite in these 16 matchups!

 

1.  Across Ettenmoors vs. Wastes of Eriador

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Breaking of Fellowship

3. Intruders in Chetwood vs. Fog on the Barrow Downs

Are the gen-con/fellowship quests allowed?

## 3 [jjenks476 on December 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1962909)

Yes, though I believe those might have the worst chance of success, because unless you want everything you are likely to buy those last. 

## 4 [Slothgodfather on December 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1962978)

Fair enough, but they are some of my favorite quests, so they make my list!  In no particular order:

 

The Seventh Level
The Stone of Erech
Escape from Mount Gram

Flight to the Ford
Murder at Prancing Pony
The Battle of Carn Dum

Because I only own a portion of the card pool, I'll just list my top 5:

IN ORDER:

The Battle of Carn Dum

Breaking of the Fellowship

The Ring Goes South

Foundations of Stone

The Treachery of Rhudaur

## 6 [Ecthelion III on December 30, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1963048)

Man, lots of people are voting for Carn Dum. I thought after reading the last thread that everyone hated it...

## 7 [MrMac10 on December 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1963703)

Good idea! My top 10, not in order:

- journey in the dark

- flight to the Ford

- seventh level

- helms deep

- foundations of stone

- wastes of eriador

- fords of isen

- escape from mount gram

- battle of five armies

- journey at the crossroads

## 8 [jjenks476 on December 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1963927)

The Saga quests are very popular, for good reason. The Battle of carn Dum was very polarizing I believe, but for people who enjoy the most difficult quests or who play NM exclusively I think it revived this cycle for them, where the quests were overall too easy.

These are some of my favorites from the overall top 10 so far.

 * Foundations of Stone (10 votes at the moment?): still such a fun quest! With the current card pool, the Nightmare version can still be challenging but in a good way.

 * Helm's Deep (tied at 8 votes with Battle of Five Armies?): I guess that LOTR players in general really like big battles. So do I!

 * Seventh Level, The Steward's Fear, Massing at Osgiliath: Not as challenging as they used to be but still so much fun! Who does not love them?!

 

Still have to think about the other half of my own top 10... :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

## 22 [jjenks476 on January 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1968950)

Yeah I'm a bit surprised at the popularity of the Saga and POD quests. Its interesting to see a lot of people seem to like the Dwarrowdelf cycle a lot. My least favorite cycle in terms of quests is Mirkwood, followed by Angmar Awakened. Maybe because they are still new and haven't really sunk in yet, but so far the new cycle doesn't seem to be too popular.

## 23 [PocketWraith on January 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1968979)

Have to say, I kind of wish the Quest Championship could just run like the Hero and Unique Ally Championships, with a full knockout bracket. I find it interesting going through a series of matchups, and tat tends to be easier than just picking a top 10 out of thin air, where I feel like there are more quests which deserve recognition but I've run out of spaces.

 

Massing at Osgiliath

Foundations of Stone

Siege of Cair Andros

The Steward's Fear

Assault on Osgiliath

The Three Trials

Intruders in Chetwood

The Weather Hills

Journey in the Dark

Helm's Deep

 

(Honourable mentions to Into Ithilien, The Antlered Crown, and Fog on the Barrow Downs. Also some of the recent quests from Angmar Awakened I enjoyed a lot but I haven't played them enough times to really feel I can confidently place them in my top ten)

Fear not!  This is just a preliminary round that sets up the knockout bracket.

Maybe because they are still new and haven't really sunk in yet, but so far the new cycle doesn't seem to be too popular.

I base my answers off how well the scenario is put together in terms of thematic consistency. By nature of being pulled straight from the source novels, the Saga ones fit neatly into that criteria. And since the GenCon quests don't depend on encounter cards available in prior deluxe expansions like the AP's do, they also trends to feel more consistent and well-thought-out. I prefer quests that can leave you feeling like you got immersed in a story and not in a puzzle.

Road to Rivendell probably doesn't work as well as some other quests by that logic, but still for whatever reason it is my absolute favorite.

I was originally concerned people wouldn't want to vote on all 60+ quests, especially since people may not have played all of them. This way the most popular get voted on, meaning a majority of people have played them, since they voted for them.

## 31 [CaffeineAddict on January 4, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1970959)

I've always liked dwarrodelf and the sagas, and my favourites tend to change, but the ones I find myself playing most often are probably:

Into the pit

Flight from moria

Foundations of stone

Shadow and flame

Seige of cair Andros

The Stewards fear

Shadow of the past

A knife in the dark

Helms deep

Battle of five armies

That said, I've barely played the quests from the last two cycles, as I just haven't had the time.

## 35 [jjenks476 on January 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1974422)

1. Wastes of Eriador - The day/night mechanic in this game is really unique and ratchets up the tension in a fun way. Plus only being able to quest every other turn makes placing progress during that time so critical for success. I also enjoy the aspect of not being able to cancel treacheries at night as it allows me an excuse to forgo A Test of Will from my decks. Across the Ettenmoors was really disappointing in how easy it was.

 

2. Trouble in Tharbad - The NM version adds some much needed difficulty to this enjoyable but easy quest. I enjoyed the mechanics of this quest a lot but found it too bland, the enemies weren't that interesting. NM added in a diverse set of new enemies and interesting treacheries that make you feel like your in a city being hunted.

 

3. Fog on the Barrow Downs - I like the separation aspect introduced in Foundations but it is not always done right, as in Breaking of the Fellowship. Here it fits, and feels perilous because you never know when you will be separated from your friends.

 

4. Conflict at the Carrock - This quest is just a blast and I love how simple it is, build up over a few turns than an epic troll smashing.

 

5. Seventh Level - Stone of Erech never really clicked for me, though I'm not sure why... Seventh Level is the go to quest for swarms of low engagement cost enemies..

 

6. Morgul Vale - This is the toughest one for me so far. Helm's Deep is appropriately epic, but I've had some of my most memorable moments fighting against Murzag and the Nazgul.

 

7. Into Ithilien - I started this game right after ATS cycle and this was one of the first quests I played. I was destroyed many times by this quest until I finally completed it. This quest taught me how to play successfully in this game.

 

8. Three Trials - This is the best quest from Ringmaker cycle in terms of theme and ingenuity. The 3 boss fights are diverse and engaging. Mount Gram really felt flat too me.

 

9. Battle of Carn Dum - These quests are both difficult, but Carn Dum revitalized this recent cycle, and really feels fresh and challenging. I was getting to the point where only NM or saga quests really are challenging, until this one. Bring on the level 8's!

 

10. Knife in the Dark - Best saga quest. Thematic and oh so juicy.

 

11. Steward's Fear - The feel of this quest is great, and really scratches a city, treachery itch I occasionally get. Can't wait to try Murder a the Prancing Pony.

 

12. The Druaden Forest - In NM mode this quest fundamentally alters how the game is played, by not allowing hero's to collect a resource every phase, meaning you have to gain resources solely through card effects. This leads to some great decisions.

 

13. Flight to the Ford - Race mechanics are always fun, and feels thematic.

 

14. Redhorn Gate - The art in the NM version is impeccable.

 

15. Blood of Gondor - I always come back to this quest to serve me humble pie, as I am generally trounced by it, but it burns so good.

 

16. Journey at the Crossroads - Epic ambush quest, and the stress is really on to deal with those Oliphaunts.

1. Across Ettenmoors vs. Wastes of Eriador (safe locations > day/night mechanics)

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Breaking of Fellowship (cool and really challenging in a different way [NM])

3. Intruders in Chetwood vs. Fog on the Barrow Downs (fun vs. boredom)

4. Massing at Osiliath vs. Conflict at the Carrock (classic and fun big battle!)

5. Seventh level vs. Stone of Erech (still cool in NM vs. boring with nowadays card pool)

6. Morgul Vale vs. Helms Deep (challenging big battle)

7. Foundations of Stone vs. Into Ithilien (such a classic!)

8. Three Trials vs. Mount Gram (both are fun but Mount Gram is not enough of a challenge--maybe NM will!)

9. Battle of Carn Dum vs. Journey in the Dark (yep, I liked this challenge as well)

10. Knife in the Dark vs. Journey Down the Anduin (classic.)

11. Steward’s Fear vs. Battle of Lake Town (replayability!)

12. Flight From Moria vs. The Druaden Forest (same! [NM])

13. Flight to the Ford vs. Shadow of the Past (hmm, just a bit more tension and a tad cooler)

14. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Redhorn Gate (played neither of them)

15. Blood of Gondor vs. Siege of Cair Andros (cool quest in NM mode)

I only played the normal versions of the quest, never NM.

 

1.  Across Ettenmoors vs. Wastes of Eriador - Day-Night-Cycle!

 

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Breaking of Fellowship - Challenge and theme beat cool mechanics



3. Intruders in Chetwood vs. Fog on the Barrow Downs - I like fighting undeads :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

4. Massing at Osiliath vs. Conflict at the Carrock - The first and one of the best "boss-battles". Back when I only had the coreset and thhe first 2 Adventure packs it was a real blast to get Beorn without a Leadership hero :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

5. Seventh level vs. Stone of Erech - More or less the oposite of CatC, but not less fun.

 

6. Morgul Vale vs. Helms Deep - Hardest vote this round! But I will go with Helms Deep as you really get this "just a Little bit longer, just survive!"-feeling

 

7. Foundations of Stone vs. Into Ithilien - Foundations is a solid quest and I never really fell in love with Into Ithlien.

 

8. Three Trials vs. Mount Gram - I'm voting for the Idea here. Even though it's probably to easy it's a cool idea (I hope NM will improve the quest). Three Trials is a quest that really annoyed me when I first played it, not knowing what was about to come. We were just a locaation and 1 Progress away from winning and this Guardians all revive? We won in the end, but we felt it took an unnessesary Long time as we coundn't survive 2 attacks from each Guardian in one round and had to take them out 1 by 1.



9. Battle of Carn Dum vs. Journey in the Dark - My favorite quest (at the Moment :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] )

 

10. Knife in the Dark vs. Journey Down the Anduin - 2nd best Saga quest! Anduin is a real classic, but that's not enough in a Championship like this.

 

11. Steward’s Fear vs. Battle of Lake Town - One of my favorites from the AtS-Cycle and with a great Feeling and replayability. Once you know Laketown it looses pretty much of it's challenge.

 

12. Flight From Moria vs. The Druaden Forest - Most of the time I hate getting punished for having to many Cards (Dunland-trap...) or being to slow (VoI + Ringmaker...), but somehow Druadan forest didn't have this effect on me and flight from Moria is to random for my liking

 

13. Flight to the Ford vs. Shadow of the Past - I would vote for Shadow, but I had one of my best Moments in FttF: The Ring calls them made me engage 3 Black Riders (I only could have engaged one), what lead to Merry + 2 hitches and a sneak attacked beorn killing them all of, giving me an Encounter card free playarea :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png].

 

14. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Redhorn Gate - Battle is the best Hobbit quest in my opinion and Redhorn Gate "just" a qualitiy quest.

 

15. Blood of Gondor vs. Siege of Cair Andros - God what did I hate this quest (SoCA), but the joy after finally beating it! Like Dark Souls, just as a Card game. 

 

16. Journey at the Crossroads vs. Encounter at Amun Dun - EaAD isn't a really memorable quest and Crossroads Transports the ambush Feeling the way I wished Into Ithilien would have done.

 

 

I already would like to thank jjenks476 for starting this, as it makes me want to play many quests I haven't touched in a long time!

1.  Wastes of Eriador - The Day/Night is awesome, but I wish the quest was actually winnable in 4 player.  I did like the safe locations in Ettenmoors, but the rest of the quest is pretty 'meh'.

2. Breaking of Fellowship - Multiple staging areas is always a crowd pleaser.

3. Fog on the Barrow Downs - See above

4. Conflict at the Carrock - Only played Massing once, and Conflict is a classic.

5. Seventh level - Tough call.  Stone of Erech is good, but I've played Seventh Level at least 10x as many times.

6. Helms Deep - Instant classic.  Morgul Vale is good, but there are some cards in that quest that are straight up bad design, imo.

7. Foundations of Stone - The original and best quest with multiple staging areas.

8. Three Trials - Has good replayability and Mt Gram was too easy (although an awesome idea)

9. Journey in the Dark - I do actually like Carn Dum, but Journey in the Dark has such a sense of impending doom.

10. Journey Down the Anduin - Both are good quests, but I'll go with the original classic.

11. Steward’s Fear - Best of the cycle vs a very one dimensional quest.

12. Flight From Moria - I like Druadan with 2 players, but I've had too many first turn losses in 3-4 player.

13. Shadow of the Past - Such a great, atmospheric beginning to the saga campaign.

14. Battle of 5 Armies - The best quest from the Hobbit boxes.

15. Siege of Cair Andros - I really dislike both of these quests.  I guess Cair Andros is slightly more interesting.

16. Encounter at Amun Dun - Fun theme, but a bit on the easy side.  Haven't played Journey at the Crossroads yet.

> Yeah I'm a bit surprised at the popularity of the Saga and POD quests. Its interesting to see a lot of people seem to like the Dwarrowdelf cycle a lot. My least favorite cycle in terms of quests is Mirkwood, followed by Angmar Awakened. Maybe because they are still new and haven't really sunk in yet, but so far the new cycle doesn't seem to be too popular.

 

It's possible that several people voting still haven't played the new quests yet.   Also, just a suggestion since this thread will likely get to many pages in length, please update u'r first post with the current vote/bracket as it will likely get lost quickly.   Thanks!

 

1.  Across Ettenmoors vs. Wastes of Eriador

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Breaking of Fellowship

3. Fog on the Barrow Downs

4. Massing at Osiliath

5. Stone of Erech - This is a hard choice for me.  Seventh is an old love, but Stone introduced the specter keyword. Brilliant! 

6. Helms Deep

7. Foundations of Stone

8. Three Trials - another close one, the random replay-ability of Three Trials pushes it ahead

9. Battle of Carn Dum

10. Journey Down the Anduin

11. Battle of Lake Town - replay-ability vs Smaug, ah! how can I choose?!   Steward's is one of my favorite "go-to" quests, but Lake Town is so fun and challenging, I think it needs to win.

12. Flight From Moria

13. Flight to the Ford

14. Battle of 5 Armies

15. Siege of Cair Andros

16. Journey at the Crossroads

Since I haven't played all quests, I can't vote on every line. 


 


1.  Across Ettenmoors vs. Wastes of Eriador   -  While Ettenmoors really has a nice LotR feel to it, it needs to be played in a series to really feel the exhaustion. Eriador is just garanteed badass.


2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Breaking of Fellowship -


3. Intruders in Chetwood vs. Fog on the Barrow Downs -


4. Massing at Osiliath vs. Conflict at the Carrock - Massing has one of the best different stages mechanic. From skirmishes with the scouts to the mad dash over Pelenor fields with the Witch King in persuit. Carrock often felt too 'gamey' to me, as I tried NOT to quest to hard (still one of my fav from mirkwood though).


5. Seventh level vs. Stone of Erech - Tried Stone once and wasn't impressed.


6. Morgul Vale vs. Helms Deep - 


7. Foundations of Stone vs. Into Ithilien - Into Ithilien was really annoying when it came out as there where few decks that could possibly beat it. Now it feels like Journey Down the Anduin once was the as the go-to quest for trying out new decks with high difficulty.


8. Three Trials vs. Mount Gram - Trials didn't click for me. Mount Gram really needs a nightmare version to make the most of it but at least it's untapped potential now.


9. Battle of Carn Dum vs. Journey in the Dark - 


10. Knife in the Dark vs. Journey Down the Anduin - The Black Riders box feels thematically silly to me. Nazgul aren't suppose to 'swarm' the good guys. In fact, Tolkien mentioned explicitly that their attacks were about fear not violence when discussing the movie adaptation.


11. Steward’s Fear vs. Battle of Lake Town - Never liked Stewards Fear. Maybe I'll grow fond it of one day.


12. Flight From Moria vs. The Druaden Forest - It's thematic that running away from the Balrog can accidentily lead you to an exit or get's you lost forever. In a way this was a pre-sidequest quest. Just a tad too random. Druadan Forest was just mechanics to me.


13. Flight to the Ford vs. Shadow of the Past - When I tried Flight to the Ford, I was already Nazgul tired. Then you had all the burdens and I just gave up.


14. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Redhorn Gate - Great all-round quest and good feel of a battle taking place. If only a turn 1 vanguard wasn't so deadly for solo.


15. Blood of Gondor vs. Siege of Cair Andros - Love them both. Siege wins here though, because the ability to 'block' enemies with locations is very unique and leads to a completely new strategic thinking and playstyle. It's close though, because Master's Malice is BS.


16. Journey at the Crossroads vs. Encounter at Amun Dun -

Of course, having picked out a top 10, a lot of these are no-brainers for me, because obviously I vote for the one I put in my top 10 over the one I didn't. I'll give some reasons though.

 

1.  Across the Ettenmoors - I hven't found this one as easy as everyone else apparently has, and I like the mechanics. Difficult to choose though because I haven't played this or Wastes that many times.

2. Breaking of Fellowship - I suspect my vote might go the other way if I'd played the Nightmare version of Tharbad, but the regular one is too easy and Breaking of the Fellowship is fun.

3. Intruders in Chetwood - Difficult, because Barrow Downs barely missed my top 10 while Chetwood made it, but Chetwood has become my standard quest for testing decks. Other than the engagement stuff and threat raising it's handily generic, tests you on every front, and the variety of sidequests keeps it interesting.

4. Massing at Osiliath - Also nicely generic and while the expanded card pool has made this one a lot easier than when it was released, it's still challenging. I like Carrock, especially in nightmare, but Massing is way more of a classic to me.

5. Seventh level - I've rarely played Erech, but Seventh Level was the first Nightmare quest I ever beat and it's one I've gone back to a lot.

6. Helm's Deep - Again, a top 10 versus an almost top 10. Helm's Deep is that much more epic though.

7. Foundations of Stone - And again. Into Ithilien is nicely challenging, but Foundations of Stone is a classic and doesn't have the same kind of instant death cards.

8. Three Trials - Three Trials is one of the best boss fight quests in the game, possibly the best full stop. Meanwhile I was never super fond of the prison break theme.

9. Journey in the Dark - Carn Dum might win out in the long run, but right now it's too new for me to pick it over a quest as good and as thematic as Journey in the Dark

10. Journey Down the Anduin - A classic, still a decent challenge in Nightmare. I've never been as fond of the Black Riders quests as some.

11. Steward’s Fear - Lake-Town I view more as a puzzle to be solved than a quest to be played. I find more interest in building decks to beat it than actually playing it out, which turns into mostly a numbers game. Steward's Fear, on the other hand, is incredibly fun and varied however many times I replay it.

12. The Druadan Forest - Flight from Moria is a quest I've never been that fond of. Druadan Forest isn't a favourite, but I enjoy it.

13. Flight to the Ford - again, not so fond of the Black Riders quests, but I prefer the race to the finish over the frustration of Hide tests.

14. Battle of 5 Armies - Redhorn Gate can be very random but otherwise tends to be on the easier side, 5 Armies is more challenging and more consistent.

15. Siege of Cair Andros - Blood of Gondor is weird, random and I'm never entirely sure how to play it. Cair Andros is tough and certainly has its share of randomness, but I always know what I should be doing and I love the challenge, plus the Nightmare version adds even more interest to the strategic side of it.

16. Encounter at Amon Din - I have enjoyed playing Crossroads so far, but I've also been bugged by the mechanics forcing you into certain approaches and playstyles. Amon Din is easy, but that also means it's accessible to pretty much any deck.

## 48 [Raven1015 on January 7, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=1977286)

 




1.  Across Ettenmoors - Both are good quests, but the safe mechanic wins out here


2. Trouble in Tharbad - I like Breaking, and Trouble is a bit too easy, but Trouble is so unique


3. Fog on the Barrow Downs - Cool representation of the barrow section of the books


4. Massing at Osiliath - Massing is still a classic


5. Stone of Erech - I liked Seventh in its day, but Stone is more relevant these days


6. Helms Deep - A difficult choice, but Helms Deep is so good


7. Foundations of Stone - Easy one for me


8. Three Trials - Two very unique quests that I love, but Three Trials just takes it


9. Journey in the Dark - I really like Carn Dum, but the Balrog battle and epic sacrifice edges it out


10. Knife in the Dark - The Nazguls win out over a quest that I've played dozens of times


11. Battle of Lake Town - Stewad's Fear is probably the better quest, but I can't get over the epicness of battling Smaug!


12. The Druadan Forest - prowl and persuading enemies. There's never been quite another scenario like the Druadan Forest


13. Flight to the Ford - Really captures the feel of the race to the ford.


14. Redhorn Gate - I know many people love Battle of 5 armies, but it never quite clicked for me enough to become a favorite.


15. Siege of Cair Andros - I've warmed up to Blood, but Siege is great fun, although a little easy to demolish if you build for it these days


16. Journey at the Crossroads - Very tactical quest with lots of decisions

1.  Wastes of Eriador: My favorite quest from the cycle.  Challenging but fun, with some unique mechanics and a thematic feel.


2. Trouble in Tharbad:  Easy, but unique and fun.  A quest I'll play when I want a quick, relaxing game.


3. Intruders in Chetwood: A great quest for messing around with engagement mechanics


4. Massing at Osiliath: One of my favorites, and a great quest to test decks again.


5. Seventh Level:  Hard call here, but I like the theme of Khazad Dum that Seventh Level brings out.


6. Helms Deep: An excellent quest that truly captures the epicness of the moment.


7. Foundations of Stone: Win or lose, this quest rarely disappoints.


8. Three Trials: Two Unique and fun quests, and it's a shame that one has to lose so early. I like the guardian battle/barrow pairing just a bit better.


9. Journey in the Dark: The best take on the Balrog, and it's a real accomplishment to defeat the thing.


10. Journey Down the Anduin: The classic.  Still fun to replay.


11. Steward’s Fear: I haven't played Battle of Lake Town, and I enjoy Steward's Fear.


12. The Druaden Forest: Not a huge fan of either quest, but I'll give it to this one.


13. Flight to the Ford: I actually dislike Shadow of the Past.  It tends to get bogged down, especially on the last stage.  So I'll take Flight to the Ford, which is the polar opposite: a mad dash to the finish.


14. Battle of 5 Armies: An excellent quest, the best out of the Hobbit saga boxes.


15. Siege of Cair Andros: It's a shame these two quests are pitted against each other, because I enjoy the siege mechanic.  I'll pick the quest that utilizes it better, especially in nightmare.


16. Encounter at Amon Din: Haven't played Journey at the Crossroads yet, and Amon Din is fun.

1.  Across the Ettenmoors vs Wastes of Eriador: I'm always partial to quests that include a different type of enemy, so this is a tough choice. But I think the massing Wargs make for a better fight than the Trolls & Giants.

 

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Breaking of Fellowship: Abstaining from voting. Neither of these really did anything for me. Maybe it's time to replay them?

 

3. Intruders in Chetwood vs. Fog on the Barrow Downs: The PoD scenarios will almost always win for me. They're tougher, they're thematic, and they're not linked to any Deluxe Expansion. It's just a more unique feel to the game and by nature have more though-out story lines and better constructed encounter decks.

 

4. Massing at Osgiliath vs. Conflict at the Carrock: Carrock just feels passe at this point. Yeah it was tough, but it's gotten easier, and it feels too side-questy. It's just combat against 4 Trolls, each time. There's very little randomness, unless you count discovering Grimbeorn but with today's cardpool, that's hardly necessary anymore.

 

5. Seventh Level vs. Stone of Erech: I absolutely love the Time mechanics in this game. And it was Undead enemies before we really had a full plate of those.

 

6. Morgul Vale vs. Helm's Deep: I hated the Morgul Vale when I first played it. I still don't like it that much, as just an endless series of boss-fights. The Bodyguards are more frustrating than anything else, and feels like a cheap mechanic to make the quest tougher.

 

7. Foundations of Stone vs. Into Ithilien: Currently my vote for the overall winner! Such a great mechanic, and especially adding in Nightmare Mode makes this quest a home run. Imagine being swept away from your fellow travellers and landing in a cave full of nightmarish ancient monsters. Great stuff.

 

8. Three Trials vs. Escape from Mount Gram: I don't like escape quests, in video games or card games. They're boring to me. Too formulaic.

 

9. Battle of Carn Dum vs. Journey in the Dark: Carn Dum is too tough - which isn't necessarily a bad thing in this game, but it's so pigeon-holed into one solution. Plus, Moria is my favorite part of the entire book series.

 

10. Knife in the Dark vs. Journey Down the Anduin: I like the massing of enemies on stage 2. It's a cool approach to the theme of the story. Knife in the Dark seemed to depart too much from the books. But honestly, I don't care for either of these too much.

 

11. Steward’s Fear vs. Battle of Lake Town: I want to vote for both! Lake-Town is such an awesome twist on a boss fight. Defending locations instead of characters. Steward's Fear, though, as insanely tough as it is for solo one-handed, is another thematic home run. I just wish the Underworld deck had more diverse cards than just the warmed-over Thugs we saw in Pelargir.

 

12. Flight From Moria vs. The Druadan Forest: Anything in forests is a winner for me. It makes my mono-Lore Ranger Trap deck super thematic, though the Prowl mechanic was just not really difficult to manage at all, unfortunately.

 

13. Flight to the Ford vs. Shadow of the Past: Declining from voting. The player cards in the first LotR Saga we great, but these quests were both a miss for me.

 

14. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Redhorn Gate: This is the only quest I've played to date that I can remember losing a hero and feeling pretty OK with it. Not because it was easy - losing Dain Ironfoot on stage 2! - but how much it fit the storyline of the cards. Freezing Cold, Avalanches. Even a Dwarven king would die of hypothermia under those snowdrifts.

 

15. Blood of Gondor vs. Siege of Cair Andros: I remember the first time my wife saw me playing this game, it was Blood of Gondor. And she was absolutely petrified of being taught to play, with cards upside down all over the place. Cair Andros wins for me, though, because of the neat idea of removing quest phases as you successfully retake each portion of the city.

 

16. Journey to the Crossroads vs. Encounter at Amon Din: Both great thematic quests whose mechanic play well with the story idea, but Cross-roads was more of an appreciated challenge. Amon Din feels more personable, trying to prevent villagers from burning to death, but the first time I played it, I think I had rescued 25 villagers and lost 2, and that was really without deck-building too much.

1. Wastes of Eriador

2. Breaking of Fellowship: I’ve only played this quest once. It was a 4-player game with Caleb Grace at worlds. It was so much fun, I’m nervous about going back and playing it again.

3. Intruders in Chetwood: Both quests are “meh” for me. I suppose I’ve played this quest more

4. Massing at Osiliath: The OG GenCon quest, much loved and adored

5. Seventh level: SoE is a better designed quest, but building a deck to thrash goblin weenies is a Guilt pleasure on mine. Sometimes I’ll just keep playing once I’ve won and increase the number of revealed cards each round to see how far I can get.

6. Helms Deep: I played only this quest for two weeks straight and still love going back to it

7. Foundations of Stone: I can actually win this quest

8. Mount Gram:

9. Battle of Carn Dum:

10. Journey Down the Anduin:

11. Steward’s Fear: I can actually win this quest

12. The Druaden Forest:

13. Shadow of the Past:

14. (The) Battle of (the) Five Armies: ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

15. Blood of Gondor: Try this quest with a mono-tactics deck, it’s a ton of fun

16. Encounter at Amon Din: I love teaching the game with this quest

It's easier than Siege of Cair Andros.

Really? Carn Dum is harder than even nightmare Cari Andros, in my opinion. But I love them both  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Nightmare Carn Dum is going to be insane, that we can agree on.

I'm pretty sure they accidentally released the Nightmare version in the regular AP.  So instead of releasing a harder "Nightmare" version, they will release an easier "Daydream" version.

1. Wastes of Eriador - Best quest of this cycle, and Flight has a lot of competition from a lot of better Saga quests.

2. Seventh Level - In NM Trouble has a better shot, but it still can't compare.

3. Fog on the Barrow Downs - The 2 POD's going at it!

4. Helms Deep - This should be a blowout

5. Stewards Fear

6. Three Trials - Amazing boss quest with lots of dynamism. 

7. Journey in the Dark - Favorite Moria quest vs best of the below par Hobbit quests

8. Druaden Forest is a unique take on the quest and very well implemented.

1. Wastes of Eriador vs. Flight to the Ford - Flight is my least liked quest from the black riders and Wastes is really good.

 

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Seventh Level - Again I don't know NM Tharbad, but the normal Version is too easy and while 7th Level isn't too brutal neither I had more fun slaying all These orcs.



3. Fog on the Barrow Downs vs. Massing at Osgiliath - In my opinion Barrow Downs has the better atmosphere, while both quests are equal in difficulty.

 

4. Helms Deep vs. Encounter at Amon Dun - No question here, right?

 

5. Foundations of Stone vs. Stewards Fear - Hard decision, but Steward has the better solo experience .

 

6. Three Trials vs. Siege of Cair Andros - Cair Andros is tough, thematic and a real classic. Trials misses mostly the theme for me. 

 

7. Journey in the Dark vs. Battle of 5 Armies - Have to vote for my favorite quest :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

8. Druaden Forest vs. Journey Down the Anduin - The ravages of time weren't to kind to Anduin. It's a well-rounded classic, but thats it. Druadan has something unique and both quests have some Auto loss cards, if they appear in the first round.

1. Wastes of Eriador vs. Flight to the Ford - Tough choice, but I've had a lot of memorable experiences on the last stage of Flight to the Ford when all of the Nazgul appear.

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Seventh Level - For some reason I never got into Trouble in Tharbad.  Maybe it's because I play secrecy a lot and the built in threat reduction felt like cheating with a secrecy deck.

3. Fog on the Barrow Downs vs. Massing at Osgiliath - Separate staging areas is my favorite aspect of quests.

4. Helms Deep vs. Encounter at Amon Dun - This is closer for me than it probably is for most people.  If Amon Din was a touch harder, I think it could be a real gem.

5. Foundations of Stone vs. Stewards Fear - These are both in my top 5.  I'll take separate staging areas over unpredictable quest outcomes.

6. Three Trials vs. Siege of Cair Andros - I really don't like quests that start with battle or siege.  It limits deckbuilding too much.

7. Journey in the Dark vs. Battle of 5 Armies - I love the impending sense of doom.

8. Druaden Forest vs. Journey Down the Anduin - I'd vote Druadan if it scaled better.  Too easy in solo, insanely difficult at 3-4 player.

2. Trouble in Tharbad vs. Seventh Level - It's a classic. Tharbad might have scored higher had it been released earlier. Now it's just the 'easy' quest of the ringmaker cycle.

Foundations of Stone vs. Stewards Fear was by far the toughest choice for me - both are excellent quests, and quite fun. Due to the uniqueness of starting apart from your fellow players, however, I chose Foundations of Stone. In solo, Stewards Fear would probably be better.

1. Wastes of Eriador vs. Journey Down the Anduin - If I can block some of the 3/4-player games out of my memory, Wastes is an excellent quest.  Journey is classic, but too easy now and too dependent on starting threat.

 

2. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Massing at Osgiliath - Actually going to abstain on this one.  Only played massing once or twice, and I don't remember much about it.

 

3. Helms Deep vs. Foundations of Stone - I suspect the winner of this match will win the championship, and I'm really torn about it.  I think I'll vote Helm's Deep because it's the only quest of the two that doesn't have a shadow card that says "discard the defending character".

 

4. Siege of Cair Andros vs. Seventh Level - I never understood the appeal of Siege of Cair Andros.  Meanwhile I've played Seventh Level many times.

****, missed a round.

 

1. Wastes of Eriador - The most difficult decision of this round because neither is really a quest I'd consider top 8 material. Anduin's a classic, but Wastes has innovative new mechanics in it and presents a challenge without needing to resort to nightmare mode.

2. Massing at Osgiliath - I never entirely got the love some people have for Five Armies. It's certainly a very good quest, challenging, varied, and the best of the Hobbit quests without a question. But Massing is one of the best quests full stop

3. Foundations of Stone - Helm's Deep probably falls somewhere at the lower end of my top 10 quests, while Foundations of Stone is one of the first quests I think of when asked to pick favourites.

4. Siege of Cair Andros - Seventh Level is only really interesting in nightmare. And Cair Andros also gains a bunch of additional strategic interest when you switch to the nightmare version, so it still wins.

1. Wastes of Eriador vs. Journey Down the Anduin - Anduin isn't challenging enough anymore and more or less forces a low starting threat.

 

2. Battle of 5 Armies vs. Massing at Osgiliath - Very close decision, but massing is just a little bit more dramatic.

 

3. Helms Deep vs. Foundations of Stone - Helms is such a cool quest: Thematic, brings a new mechanic, challenging without Frustration. Foundations is by no means bad, but what made it unique (the separation) simply isn't unique anymore. Foundations could really kill you too, if the wrong player got the wrong separate quest (in my opinion breaking of the Fellowship did a much better job with the separation mechanic).

 

4. Siege of Cair Andros vs. Seventh Level - Like Anduin 7th Level is too easy.



 

Really surprised so few Saga quests made it into the top 8 (espacially from the lotr Sagas), as I like these more than many "normal" quests.

Anyway it's interesting to see which boxes and cycles are still represented:

Core -> Journey down the Anduin

Khazad-Dum -> 7th Level

Dwarrowdelf-cycle -> Foundations of Stone

Heirs of Numenor -> Siege of Cair Andros

Angmar Awakend -> Wastes of Eriador

Hobbit Saga/On the doorstep -> Battle of the 5 armies

Lotr Saga/ Treason of Saruman -> Helms Deep

PoD -> Massing at Osgilath

 

We see that there is no outstanding cycle or box, but voice of Isengard + cycle is the only "set" that didn't make it into the quarterfinal with a box OR cycle quest!

I've heard a lot of positive things about Helms Deep and seeing it go in the championship makes me put the Campagaign on my to-do list. I generally didn't like the saga box quests as I found the Hobbit having too many 'gimmicky quests' while Black Riders felt both too hamstringed by story limitations (enough with the Nazgul already!) yet also too far from the original story (soo much combat in a completely non-combat part of the book). I haven't looked at the quests after that. 

 

I'm surprised Wastes and Siege got as far as they did. Neither seemed very fan-favorite to me. I'm looking foreward to see who wins, but it's obvious that each contest is very close. No super fan-favorites here.

Yeah, the Hobbit quests were mostly pretty gimmicky, and while I'm OK with the Black Riders quests, I would personally rate it as much weaker quest-wise than the two boxes which followed it (undecided thus far about Land of Shadow). Ring Goes South is solid if not super interesting, and then Journey in the Dark, Breaking of the Fellowship, The Uruk-Hai, Helm's Deep and Road to Isengard are all really interesting quests.

100% agree with the hobbit quests (it's the main reason I don't like most of them).

 

But I love the Black Riders quests. I find them all to be maximal thematic, as the relativly strong combat aspect isn't really a problem for me. It's a basic game mechanic and quests with a low enemie count often turn out boring. Casually questing through without having to fear enemies would destroy the illusion of the scary black rider for me. But giving hobbits boni against higher threat enemies is a fair enough deal to symbolise, that you don't want to face these guys, but have to overcome your fear to win the scenario. Looking at the combat more of a "running away" than actually "killing" the riders helps too. Obviously you could ask why a dagger helps you at running away, but I guess it could help you climb ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Of Course it would have been awesome to make the black riders quests more or less combat free and I think there could have been a way to alter the gameplay so much, that you have a combat replacement, that doesn't abbadon the combat stats, so you could completly forget them, but you might as well keep it simple and straight out battle the riders, what is easier for new players, who, let's say, played the core set and then bought the black riders. Completly overthrowing the combat mechanism could easily confuse them. Writing this thinking about some custom rules for the black riders quests seems like an interesting idea...

When does this round of voting end?

## 104 [Calvadur on January 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=2023370)

As there wasn't a post for over a week, we could end the round I would say. I did count the votes and some match-ups  are very close (note that not everyone did vote in every match-up):

Wastes of Eriador vs Journey along the Anduin: 11 - 5



Battle of the 5 armies vs Massing at Osgiliath: 7 - 9

 

Helms Deep vs Foundations of Stone: 8 - 7

 

Siege of Cair Andros vs The 7th Level: 9 - 8

 

Hopefully I did not misscount a vote. If everything is correct we could advance to the next round I think (not trying to overtake jjenks476's threat; it just Looks like he doesn't have the time to finish the Championship, what would be sad, that far in it) already.) 

## 105 [PocketWraith on January 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=2023423)

What the hell? Helm's Deep beat Foundations of Stone? You people are crazy.

 

1. Massing at Osgiliath.

2. Siege of Cair Andros.

## 106 [GrandSpleen on January 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=2023449)

OK, so looks like we're going into the semi-finals with:

 

1. Wastes of Eriador vs. Massing at Osgiliath

2. Helm's Deep vs. Siege of Cair Andros

 

 

My votes:

1. Wastes of Eriador

2. Helm's Deep

## 107 [Teamjimby on January 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=2023618)

None of the remaining quests would be in my top 3, or probably even top 5.  But, if I have to vote:

 

1. Wastes of Eriador

2. Helm's Deep

## 108 [Seastan on January 31, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=2023631)

BoFA should've gotten further. It's interesting how many of the quests in the last round were evenly matched, but in this round I am predicting Wastes and Deep to take the wins by a large margin.

 

1. Wastes of Eriador

2. Helm's Deep

I like Wastes of Eriador because it's unique. The idea of fighting off packs of wolves whose attack varies with time of day is way different than just another bunch of orcs.

Wastes popularity also surprises me. But I never really understood how the community views Massing at Osgiliath. I remember many people called it the most difficult quest ever, but it never seemed that difficult to me. Even now it is rated on quest companion as more difficult than Morgul Vale, Dol Guldur, The Dunland Trap and Into Ithilien.

 

I'm also a bit surprised about Cair Andros popularity considering it's random hatered for multi sphere decks which seems neither thematic nor fun to me. 

 

Still I think all top 10 quests in this competition are certainly among the best, so no real argument from me here.

## 121 [Calvadur on February 7, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=2037853)

No votes since 5 days, so I think we can close this round of voting and go into the final round.

 

Wastes of Eriador vs. Massing at Osgiliath: 5 - 9

 

Siege of Cair Andros vs Helm's Deep: 6 - 7 (1 abstention from voting)

 

 

If I did count correctly out final is:

 

Massing at Osgiliath vs. Helm's Deep

 

What a matchup! One of the oldest against one of the newest quests! PoD against Saga! But both on the harder side.

 

 

The 3rd place match would be:

 

Wastes of Eriador vs. Siege of Cair Andros

## 122 [GrandSpleen on February 7, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197270-the-quest-championship/?do=findComment&comment=2038186)

OK, so the vote is...

 

For 1st place:  Massing at Osgiliath vs Helm's Deep

For 3rd place:  Wastes of Eriador vs Siege of Cair Andros

 

 

My votes:

1. Helm's Deep

3. Wastes of Eriador

For 1st place:  Massing at Osgiliath vs Helm's Deep

For 3rd place:  Wastes of Eriador vs Siege of Cair Andros

 

Helm's Deep is in my opinion a really unique experience, as it is the only quest you really only have to survive. And imo they nailed the Encounter-deck, very good mix of all three card types.
