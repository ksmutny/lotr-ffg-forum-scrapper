Ok im nowhere near playing this yet, but a peek through my new shadow and flame pack shows there are two of each treachery card depicting the sword and whip, both say they should be attached to the balrog as weapons, but they dont say until the end of the phase/round and dont say restricted.

So does this mean if the draws go that way he could be wieldin two swords and two whips all at once, four weapons?? How many arms (Tolkien implies only two with his right/left descriptions)

What am i missing?

Notice how each has the unique symbol next to their name? Only one of each can be in play at once =)

I don't know why they didn't just make it "Limit of 1" instead as it is quite easy to miss the unique symbol on an encounter treachery card.

Still 1 whip and 1 sword is mighty nasty....

Both Fiery Sword and Fiery Whip are unique (look for the • in front of name) which means only one of each can be in play at the same time. If a second copy comes out it doesn't attach to the Balrog.

Hehe it isnt a big peek, just a little peek while I sleeve all the cards and put them into the not-yet-using compartment of my card case :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
