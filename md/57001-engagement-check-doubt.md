Hello, I was playing a Conflict at the Carrock solo game for the first time last night and I'm a little confuse about engagement check.

I always made all engagement checks this way: First, player/s can engage enemies in from the staging area if want to.

Second: the enemies in the staging area with an engagement cost less or equal than the player's threat level engages the player.

 

How many enemies per turn engages a player? for example, if there are the 4 Conflict at the Carrock's trolls in the staging area with an engagement cost less or equal than the player's threat level, ALL trolls engages the player in the same phase?

I did it this way last night, but couldn't hold 2 turns against them.

You played it right. 

That's why the golden rule of solo Carrock is: don't go to stage 2 unless you are confident your threat will be below 34 after questing and you have a way of taking out Mr. Plus Three Threat that turn.

ALL monsters that are lower than the player threat attack.. all of them, in a single turn.

In solo this is all obvious... but in 2+ player games the engagement rules are a little more complex.

1) To fail a engagement check you need to be lower OR EQUAL to the monster threat stat.
2) You can only optionally engage 1 monster per player. Starting with the 1st player.
3) If one player fails the threat checks all monsters that fail go to him.
4) If 2 or more players fail the threat check the monsters force engaged the players in turn order. For example if you are playing a 2 player game and both players fail a monster check on 3 monsters, then the highest threat monster will force engage player 1, 2nd highest player 2, 3rd highest player 1 again.

Hope this helps. Threat management is one of the most important things in the game. CotC is a super easy quest once you build a threat management deck. Try to make sure your starting threat is around 26ish.

------EDIT

Oh. and in the above example, if 2 of the monsters have a tied threat stat, the engagements happen exactly the same way but teh 1st player gets to pick witch monster engages first.

Yeah, all the trolls engage you in the same turn. That's the reason why it's so important to keep your threat low during this quest. Once you have enough allies and support out you can take out one troll after the other. But if your threat is 34 or higher when you reach that step of the quest and you're not prepared, well then you're in a lot of trouble...
