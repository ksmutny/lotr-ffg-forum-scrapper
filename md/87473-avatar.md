There once was a perfectly dreadful movie of that name, but I had disliked the idea even before then. And I have avoided using one here, especially since no self-created profile pictures are allowed (seemingly), until now when I realized that the anonymous white shade of a figure has little meaning when it is about the only one out there.

 

To celebrate this famous decision of mine, I want to ask you what made you to choose the avatar you did? Is it solely the art, is it the favourite character from the books, did you want something to look like you, or just something funny?

 

I myself, I asked my girlfriend to choose for me.

Hmmmm Glaurung is a dragon. So my avatar is looks like one.

i was wondering when you would get an avatar :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

mine is gandalf becuase he is my favourite character. i have had 3 avatars over the history of the game, the first was core set gandalf, the second was a rather unknown piece that i liked- the lava spurting out of moria in the 3rd quest from khazad dum, and now this one

 

i am not sure if i prefer these ones, or a a real photo...being able to use your favourite art is great, but its sometimes nice to see a real face behind a poster

Mine  was a Nazgul since Khamul is a Nazgul, but they took it away so I just took this cool looking guy :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

*looks at his avatar*

I have just picked one from the available ones after the forum rework. Though my avatar before was also from Space Hulk: Death Angel because I like the art (and the game too, of course). Yeah, I know it is not LotR-based, I'm on the leave.

*leaves the thread*

## 6 [Tracker1 on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=826748)

Looks just like me! We'll almost.

I used to have the Legolas Avatar, right about when the forum changed to the new format I posted my Return of the King Deck. So, i was feeling Aragorn inspired. He also is an amazing Tracker in the books and movie, which is something I do professionally and for fun, I spruced this up a bit by adding the signature below, to fit the whole Tracker1 forum Identity (like if it really matters, but its fun anyway).

I wish there were more avatars to choose from. If I had my pick I would probably use Lore Aragorn, the strider version when he is doing most of his tracking in the books, would be a perfect fit.

Silvan Tracker is one of the Avatars, but i really don't like the close up of he/she's face (if you know the gender i would be curious to know. It think female. The overall picture on the card is great, but me being a manly man, thought it was to feminine for my forum persona.

Jeez, i guess i put way to much thought into this.

Sam is my favorit character and my wife thinks I look and act a little like him :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] oh, and with my 164 cm in high and skinny I'm often teased about my ancestors and kinship to hobbits :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 8 [Gizlivadi on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=826796)

I chose this because I like the art a lot, and Elladan just looks cool. However I recently realized that I look pretty much exactly like him (after I shave at least).

## 9 [Pharmboys2013 on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=826801)

I've always been fond of the chapter where Frodo meets and talks with Gildor as it is the first time you get the sense that this little hobbit is destined for something greater. It's also the first encounter with the ever enigmatic elves which is cool as well

## 10 [legolas18 on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=826805)

Well. Mine is a bit confusing, I'll tell you that. My name is legolas18, but when I first made a profile I didn't know there'd be avatars. I didn't plan on that, so I decided to use Beorn, because HE is actually my favorite character. After the forums changed, Beorn wasn't there anymore, so here I am. A lovely angry Stone-Giant.  All of this comes back to the question: Why did I choose legolas18 as my name in the first place? To this day, I wouldn't be able to answer that question.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This has ever been my favourite passage as well. Gildor Inglorion does so much to the story, with so little space in the book.

## 12 [monkeyrama on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=826809)

I just rather liked this guy's face. At the time I think it was also to have an avatar that no-one else had, but that seems a little silly.

## 13 [lleimmoen on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=826810)

Thanks for the many replies. I was almost afraid to post this stupid topic but I'm glad none of you have scorned it.

## 14 [Raven1015 on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=826850)

I love the rangers of Gondor and the idea of them waging this guerrilla warfare in Ithilien against Sauron's forces. I'm also a big fan of the Lore sphere, where the rangers live. So this was the natural avatar for me.

## 15 [rekath16 on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=827047)

I chose Beravor because she is so sexy.

## 16 [Samwise Gamgee on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=827082)

I think Elrohir has some of the best art for a hero and I like the twin combo.

## 17 [Alex6222 on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=827094)

Well i would personally like to have more avatars, Bard would be awesome or the leadership Boromir. It would be awesome that you could choose an avatar from every card that exists. Until then i stay with my hungry-looking warg.

I agree about Elrohir's art, I find him much better looking than his twin.

Leadership Boromir has one of my favourite arts, it even constantly makes me re-consider using him in a deck, though I know the Tactics version is so much more useful at the moment.

## 20 [Nickpes on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=827367)

Nice thread ! Avatar is something I believe express a bit about thyself. In this forum i change it a lot cause the tolkien ones i would prefer are not there, and will not be since they come from silmarillion. These would be Fingolfin, Luthien (dancing before mandos), Turin, a scene from the Noldors flight and many more. If we talk for the cards in game, i would like to have beregond, smaug or a nazgul ... They are not there so i picked this one cause i liked and soon will turn to Glorfindel (he is there isn't he?)

## 21 [muemakan on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=827463)

I am still hoping to get my old avatar back....before the new forum software.

## 22 [Noccus on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=827526)

Choose this one at the time as no one seemed to have it yet to my knowledge.

That, and it's quite distinguishable.

There are far better avatars to pick from really, but it has grown on me.

Recently íve seen it pop up on a few other people though.

## 23 [legolas18 on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=827715)

@lleimmoen: I feel the same way about Leadership Boromir. As I'm going through the heroes wondering which heroes I should pick, he just pops out because his art is amazing. I can't wait until he gets more attention.

## 24 [Mr Coffee on August 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=832021)

My original avatar was the picture of Gloin (hero version), and still one of my favorite cards in the game (as far as the art is concerned). I like that it's not an "action" picture, as sometimes I feel that artists use "action" to make up for an inability to connect with the characters they are painting (I'm specifically referring to game artists). While I have really enjoyed the artwork in this game, and think it has done a better job of avoiding that pitfall, it can still be seen at times.

 

I enjoy that depiction of Gloin... a LOT. It's just him standing there. But instead of just a bland pose, the artist (Tom Garden) took a plain profile painting of him standing there, with a simple background of green fields.... running his thumb down his axe. I love the "promise" that picture holds. Something is about to get its head split open from that axe, and Gloin has this resolute and determined look on his face. He knows what he's about to get into, and he's not gonna worry about his fate. He's gonna crack skulls.  Just a great pic that actually adds to the character's depth for me...  Like I said, one of my favorites in the game so far.

So, OF COURSE, that avatar is no longer an option with the new forum. Go figure. I didn't particularly care for any of the other dwarven pics. One of my favorite characters, Faramir, doesn't have any real representation in the avatar world here. My other favorite is Gandalf, who DOES have plenty of representation, but they are all facial close-up shots (except for the new one added that is from the backside), and all of them have plenty of folks using them already, so I figured I'd leave it alone for now. So I went with the Gandalf token symbol from the Lord of the Rings: The Board Game (represented in this game as the Leadership sphere token). I thought it was a decent double fit, as it gives me a way to rep Gandalf and one of my favorite sphere's in this game (also has the only Faramir so far in the game... so a triple win?)

Quite honestly, if they don't give me my old Gloin avatar back, or put out something that similarly grabs my attention, I may just end up using an avatar from another game...  I have the "Hey, That's My Fish" game from FFG that I play with my 7-year old.  There's an avatar of an angry penguin shaking his "fist" at the sky from that game... lol.  I may just go with that, simply cuz I'm pretty sure I'd be the only one with it on this board... and because it makes me chuckle every time I see it... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

"mine is gandalf becuase he is my favourite character."

 

What Rich said. Gandalf is also my favorite character, though, I also love hobbits and dwarves, so I have vacilated between Bilbo, Gloin (core set) and Gandalf (core set). I pretty much consider all of the art in this game to be outstanding!

## 27 [danpoage on August 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=832204)

I had a bear, but they took it off in the latest forum changes. I am hoping that they add the art for the Beorn hero card, so that I can have that correct avatar. In the mean time, this guy looks about right.

## 28 [Mr Coffee on August 16, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87473-avatar/?do=findComment&comment=842236)

There.  I've done it....

 

 

 

Beware the unquenchable wrath of Sauron's most heinous abomination:  The Gundabad Tainted-Penguin.

My Avatar is a powerful Dark Elf from the Anima setting. I used him as a villain in the first Anima campaign I ran.

Mine is the Gandalf image from the card "Foe-Hammer." I really like Magali's art and especially on this card. Gandalf is in the Goblin Town with his glowing sword, Glamdring, the Elven sword forged for Turgon, the King of Gondolin during the First Age. I also really like this card in the game. A powerful card draw ability for the cost of zero? Amazing. Definitely a much needed boost for tactics. Anyways, I guess all those are reasons I like this picture for my avatar.

 

And as an aside, I really wish Peter Jackson had made Gandalf's (and Thorin's) sword glow blue in this scene in the Hobbit (part 1). He did it for Bilbo's Sting, why couldn't he do the same for Gandalf? It is such an iconic scene in the book and could have been simple to just make it glow blue....oh well (I still really enjoyed the movie, btw!).

Jackson forgot to make Glamdring glow in the LOTR movies (some say he didn't do it to avoid similarities to the star wars prequels that were being make around that time) so it would have been weird to make them glow in the Hobbit and not in LOTR.

My original avatar was Loqtza [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/warhammer/warhammer-invasion-card-spoilers/_/march-of-the-damned/loqtza-motd], a Lizardmen hero in the Warhammer Invasion card game. It was the box art for March of the Damned, half of which depicts this guy, that actually got me into LCGs in the first place. The secondary reason I chose this guy was because he was the closest thing to Jabba the Hutt, and I always think it hilarious to have a Jabba avatar (my bgg account has such a thing). 

 

This current thing is The Red-Gloved Man [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/CoC/CoCCards.html/_/the-yuggoth-contract/whispers-in-the-dark/The-Red-Gloved-Man-WitD], from Call of Cthulhu LCG. I just like this guy, there's a kind of sexy stealthiness and noir feeling to him, somehow. Or maybe I just need to get out more...

despite not playing the game i do enjoy reading lovecraft....though ironically i think his greatest creations were in the shorter stories

Lovecraft can be quite wonderful, yes! I think it's the rest of the mythos that often proves to be a let-down, though some of his longer stories can get a little over-padded at times...

I guess that makes sense, to keep it consistent across the trilogies. I can see how it would look like a light saber all the time when Gandalf fights against orcs, which I think might have come out a bit cheesy, so maybe it was a good choice after all to leave them normal blades.
