Can you cancel the damage Wilyador suffers at the end of each round with the help of Honour Guard?

I think you can, but you'd need some kind of readying for Honour Guard (or two of them in play alternating between rounds), as characters ready at the start of the Refresh phase whereas the damage occurs right at the end of the round.

 

EDIT: Actually, you don't need two. Not sure what I was thinking! One Honour Guard would just be exhausted for most of the next round, ready at the start of the refresh and be able to cancel the damage. Sorry about that! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, you can use Honour Guard here.

Hey Honour Guard, defend Wilyador from these flies! And these bees! And these mosquitoes! That is all

That's not a spear he's holding - it's a huge incense stick to keep away the bugs.
