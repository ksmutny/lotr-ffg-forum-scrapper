# [Question about Forced and Response....](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50105-question-about-forced-and-response/)

## 1 [Glaurung on July 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50105-question-about-forced-and-response/?do=findComment&comment=501063)

As i understand if couple of effects  happen in the same time the first player chose the order of they resolve. If there is a force effect is happen before any other effect right?????  Like if we have for example 1 Force and 1 Response effect in the same time, the Force effect resolve first right???

In HFG first stage quest card say  Forced: When you  sucessfully quest look 3 top cards of the encounter deck chose 1 and add it to the staging area and discard the other 2. So when i quest sucessfully and there is enough tokens to defeat it(8 tokens) should i discard it and go to the second stage(ignore force effect) or i should the fullfiled the Force effect first and then move to second stage???

in the rulebook it says quest cards are discarded IMMEDIATELY upon completion of its objectives.  in your case, the card is discarded as soon as the progress tokens are placed on it and the forced effect no longer happens since the card is no longer in play.

Actually, I am not playing it this way (but I definitly could be wrong):

I consider the quest being successfull in a first step, which would trigger the forced effect and reveal encounters, then put the progress tokens on the quest, leading to quest completion and revealing the next quest.

This is indeed subject to interpretation...

 

A similar issue I faced, relative to Signs of Gollum:

I have Signs of Gollum guarded by a location, which is in fact the active location.

After successfully questing, I put some progress tokens on the active location, are discard it as it is fully explored.

Can I claim Signs of Gollum now, since I had successfully quested, or I must wait for another subsequent quest attempt since the "successfully quested" event is passed ?

1)  page 22 of the rulebook "Players immediately advance to the next stage of a quest as soon as they place a number of progress tokens equal to or greater than the number of quest points the current quest card has. Additional progress tokens earned against the quest do not carry over to the next stage."

since you immediately advance, no other actions on the quest card are relevant (except if they say "when removed from play" which none do at this moment).

2)  according to the unoffical faq v 3.1 an objective, "Can be claimed once unguarded at the next available Action window. The Guarded keyword does not trigger if returned back to the staging area when detached."

since you successfully quested the location, you will claim the Signs of Gollum at the next available action window which would be immediately after in the case of the card being a location (no more traveling that turn).

My friend i play this game for 2 months already and your answer is quite clear but in not really fit here. This kind of answer i logic but forced effect is happens  first maybe??? I think there is some doubt about this........... With response effect or other there is no question at all but with force effect  im not sure.....

This not easy question....... but thanks anyway.  Pumkins what you think????

I've also had the same question. Another one they can put in the next revision of the FAQ.

Personaly, I play it that you still need to resolve the effect (look at top 3, add one to staging) before quest 2B becomes the current quest.

The first two quests in THFG are made so that you always reveal an additional card (quest 1B have you do it "after" questing, quest 2B "before"). I chose to respect the spirit of this concept.

As for the reference to the rulebook, I understand the rule quoted. But let me add 2 further question then:

- When are the progress token placed on the quest card?

- When are you considered to have successfully or unsuccessfully quested?

If there's a long enough gap between those 2 events, then there could be room to resolve the "forced" effect before switching from quest 1 to 2.

About Signs of Gollum. Here is quite clear you can claim it. You as a first player chose a order of events resolves.  There is no force effect so sure you can.

Right questions!!! You put it in right form thank you.

I also think force effect happen first. I suppose we should to wait next FAQ to get answers on those questions.......

until we get an official response, this ruling will be up to interpretation but i am still standing by my first statement; the force effect does not happen after completion of the quest is satisfied because the rulebook says it is immediately discarded.  think of it this way, you are "questing" through a cave and as you progress through it you make many encounters (think of this as each turn you quest and then reveal the encounter card).  once you leave the cave, no more encounters!  that is, until you start the next leg of the journey which in game would be the next quest card.

again, until we get a final ruling there is no right or wrong answer.  i can sympathize and agree that still resolving the force effect can be legal and would actually add a hint more difficulty which some say is needed.  hopefully an updated faq is somewhere in its completion.

90% is like this but still...... There is a forced effect....... I prefer to play with resolve it first. Game is already to easy...... Like this is more interesting +should be some respect to force effect. Will wait for the FAQ anyway.

reno, if you are correct, when the heck would this forced effect take place?

from what i gather from your argument...it never would...which would make it pointless to be on the card.

or, are you trying to say that "quest successfully" does not refer to the completion of that quest card, but the completion of each quest phase that gets you to the 8 progress tokens needed for 1B (but not after the 8?)

## 12 [Spirit Juggler on July 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50105-question-about-forced-and-response/?do=findComment&comment=503800)

Questing successfully simply means a quest phase where you score progress tokens. Regardless of whether you complete a location or quest card. 

## 13 [Strovengard on July 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50105-question-about-forced-and-response/?do=findComment&comment=504055)

To be more specific, the quest is successfull if the combined willpower of all questing characters is greater than the threat force of enemies and location in the stagging area. The quest is successfull even before tokens are put on the active location/quest card.

This means that the forced effect of the card will be resolved even if the quest leads to the completion of the quest.

Just my two cents.

 thanks spirit and strovenguard; that's exactly how i interpreted the card! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I agree with this interpretation 100%.

Successfully questing and placing tokens on a quest card (or active location) are not the same thing, although one normally results in the other.

As the forced effect occurs immediately after questing successfully, it happens before progress tokens are placed
