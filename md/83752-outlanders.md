I've been doing some extensive playing of outlander decks with three, two and even Hurluin by himself!

Sorry if you allready saw these on the  Board Game Geek site, but I thought I would put the links if you haven't.

 

This is the link for the 3 hero deck: Glorfindel (spirit), Bilbo, Hurluin

Summary:  I'm shocked by how Powerful thes guy are they can do it all.  You don't even need two other heroes for the easier quests!

Anyone else giving these guy a try yet?  What's your take on them?

I believe Glaurung will have another errata request soon….

 

I don't have the pack yet, but it seems i found my deck…

I'm not inclined to try the one hero deck myself, as I'm not a fan of decks that really need a particular card in the opening hand to function or that just have to hope they can survive a quest long enough to be able to get rolling.

Still, that is pretty impressive and I look forward to trying out an Outlands deck myself sometime.

I was thinking to try Hirluin and Elrond so I'd always be able to play at least one Outland Ally, regardless of sphere, and maybe Bilbo or Berevor for card draw.

Thanks for posting these links!  I liked the base of the 2-hero deck you put together…
