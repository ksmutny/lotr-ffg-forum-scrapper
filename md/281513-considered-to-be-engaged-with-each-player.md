For enemies that are "Considered to be engaged with each player" but stay in staging area, how do they work? I played it like this:

1) They attack every player in player order during monster attacks, each time with new shadow card.

2) During player attacks, each player can attack this enemy seperately.

 

Am i doing this wrong or right? Can we attack the enemy together without ranged characters if it's engaged with all of us?

1) Correct.

2) Correct.

No, only one player can attack at a time, excepting Ranged. Of course, Ranged characters could attack the enemy once per player in the combat phase if they had enough readying.

Thanks, good to know that we're doing this right for future games.
