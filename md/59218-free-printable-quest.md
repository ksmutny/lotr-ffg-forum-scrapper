I thought I remembered reading somewhere that there was an unreleased quest created for one of the fantasy flight tournaments/convention, that was released to the public due to player requests. I can't seem to figure out where I read this (maybe i'm thinking about a different game... or i dreamed it... its a very vague memory). I've checked the past news for this game, and browsed around the site... even googled... no luck. Does anyone know what I'm talking about, or where it can be found if it exists?

Has to be. That is the only one that was released at a tournament (I think it was released at GenCon)....but it is not free.....it is print on demand. I found it on amazon for $12.00.

I also mostly play solo. You can beat Osgiliath Solo. I do it many times with many decks......

my point with this has always been...

faced with the choice to buy a new ad.pack or a brutally hard- lower quality- non compatible with rest of the game quest that doesnt even have player cards

whatcha' gonna choose? if you like brutally hard then fine go for it and if it was cheaper then yeah fine....but its the same price as an acutal 60 card pack...

if your looking for a good free custom quest you can not go past "The Culling at Barrow-Downs" [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/710317/feonixs-custom-scenario-3-the-culling-at-the-bar]

Just download this pdf and print it out! [http://www.geckoth.com/dump/bgg/Feonix%203%20-%20CullingBarrowDowns.zip]

If you have card sleeves all you need to do is print them out on normal paper and put an original card in teh sleeve and palce the print out in front of it... than play. It requires 1 copy of core as it uses the core encounter cards as it is prety old.. still I think it is one of the best quest for this game. much better than than most ffg versions.

Another guys quest is Ninjabutter's ones I think it is called... he has made about 6 or 7.

There is also a series called Orks were you play as orks agaist the good guys that is kinda fun. Basiclay you control the encounter deck.

> lower quality-

why do people think this? It comes from the same printer, on the same stock.. it is totally indistinguishable from the "real" cards
