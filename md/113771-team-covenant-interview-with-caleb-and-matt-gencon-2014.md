I really liked this video. Especially when they talk about how to revisit Moria and the Balrog while still keeping it fresh; it seems it'll be quite different from Shadow and Flame, maybe the Balrog's appearance will be designed to be a "surprise".. Also I liked when they talked about the upcoming boxes, how they decided to go to Angmar for the next cycle and how they designed the new saga boxes.

It's really a treat to see "behind the scenes" a little bit, I'm very thankful for Team Covenant. I do wish they had asked a little bit more about Treason of Saruman and Lost Realm though.

I suspect very much that the questions were discussed before the camera was turned on.
