Just once per game, no matter how many copies of Landroval you manage to play over the course of the game. Here's Nate French's response to this specific question (from javascript:void(0);/*1344383284638*/ [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications-updated-27012012/page__p__4141#entry4141]):

'"Per game" limits are not card specific, they refer to any copy of that effect under the player's control. If you have reached the "per game" limit, you cannot trigger that effect again, with another copy of the card in your deck, a copy of the card you gained control of from another player, or from the same card that has left play and re-entered the game."

 It's frustrating that the new FAQ does not include this (and several other) official clarifications that have been issued via email and the forums over the months. Surely FFG should have made it comprehensive and incorporated all the answers they have given to substantive rules questions.
