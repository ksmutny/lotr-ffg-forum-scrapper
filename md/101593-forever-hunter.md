Just like Campaign mode, I think there can be something to let the standard mode become more "Epic" ,so I made this guy——

 

Forever Hunter LV 1

Engage cost 50

Threat X

Atk 3

Def 2

HP 5

Orc. 

X is the number of players in the game.

When Forever Hunter leave play, put it back to the staging area,Forever Hunter get +1 hit point until the end of the game.

At the begining of the encounter phase ,Forever Hunter engage the first player.At the end of the  round , put Forever Hunter back to the staging area.

Victory 1.

 

When set up the game ,put Forever Hunter into staging area.Between two games players can use Victory Points to buy some new effect.like——

One of the heros get 1 resource at the begining of the game (limited once per hero)——cost 1 victory points

Get 7 starting hand(limited once per player)——cost 2 VPs

Reduce your starting threat level by 1(limited three times per player)——cost 2 VPs

One hero get +1 ATK——cost 2 VPs

One hero get +1 DEF——cost 2 VPs

One hero get sentinel——cost 2 VPs

One hero get ranged——cost 3 VPs

One hero get +1 will power——cost 3 VPs

And of course like campaign mode , when the game ends, dead hero can't be used forever and change new hero will let you raise your starting level for 1.

When use this rule and passed 1 circle, you can creat your Forever Hunter LV2 , and so on.

How about it? I want to get more advice.Thx.

Nice idea. I really wish FFG would release "Campaign packs" for each past cycle to include boons and burdens and campaign rules for old cycles similar to those used in the LOTR Saga Expansions. Of course, they have their hands full with Nightmare already, so it's a bit of a pipe dream, but I'd love to have a chance to level up characters between quests.

I really like the idea of using victory points to purchase things between quests.  It would give you some extra incentive to play differently and chase down those victory points.  I think this system would only work well when there is a natural difficulty progression between quests (like in the Core Set quests), otherwise the quests would get too easy.  Maybe something fun to try out in Nightmare.  Or maybe the Forever Hunter could level up between scenarios (in addition to leveling up in the scenario).  Very cool idea!

That would be really awesome, great idea!

Yes, I definitely agree. There should be some other use for victory points. All they do (other than help with score, of course... But really, I never keep track of score. It's either win or lose) is take the card out of the deck. If you could spend them for some kind of bonus for the next quest that you play it would be a very nice effect.
