In FAQ 1.6 (1.01) it says surge,doomed, and guarded keywords should be resolved anytime the card on which they occur is revealed from the encounter deck, including during setup.

My question is during setup playing the black riders the first scenario tells you to setup a black rider in the staging area. Do you also do a hide test? Before you start the game The card black rider reads Hide 2.

Should (1.01) read all keywords and not just surge, doomed, and guarded?

Been away from the game for a few months so a little rusty on the rules but the new cards that follow the books got my excited to play again. Its so cool playing the hobbits you really get the picture that everyone is important even the lowliest of us.

Anyone have a good link to a current Turn Sequence sheet?

Hide is a keyword like many other that are triggered when revealed, the setup on black riders tell you to put it in play. Putting it in play without any words telling you to reveal it don't trigger those keyword, be it setup or any other time.

You'll notice the next quest will instruct you to put another one in play and reveal it.

This turn sequence is quite old but still good : http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/91892/lord-rings-lcg-turn-sequence [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/91892/lord-rings-lcg-turn-sequence] it just doesn't include the 1.01...

Awesome thank you. I never noticed the wording about reveal. This helps a lot.

The reveal mechanic also comes into play with cards like Piercing Cry [http://www.hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Piercing-Cry-TBR]. For my first few run throughs, I was performing an extra hide test when I didn't need to.

Ok cool so with piercing cry you just put it into play and not reveal it so the keyword hide doesn't get triggered.
