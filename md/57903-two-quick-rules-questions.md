 Hi everyone,

1. When at 'Anduin Passage" are the two cards from the encounter deck revealed simultaneously or 1 by 1 and if the later is true can I take actions between the reveals (for example use 'Henamarth Riversong' to look at the second card)?

2. Does 'Lone wolf' got to the top of the encounter deck even if it loses during the combat phase?

Thanks

1. No, you can't. (See Turn Sequence on p.30 Rulebook).

2. I guest you meant Wolf Rider. If you defeated him in combat phase he discards to encounter discard pile, if not - to the top of encounter deck. Rulebook p.20: Any time one of these cards has 0 hit points, it is immediately defeated. Defeated characters are placed in their owner’s discard pile, and defeated enemies are placed in the encounter discard pile.

In answer to your questions.

1. The cards are revealed individually and any when revealed or keyword effects such as doomed or surge are resolved. You may only play response actions to the revealing of these cards though, so no you can not use Riversongs effect as it is an Action: and there is no window.

Shadow: Wolf Rider attacks the defending player. That player may declare 1 character as a defender. Deal Wolf Rider its own Shadow card. After combat, return Wolf Rider to the top of the encounter deck.

2. Wolf rider needs to be in play for the return to the top of the encounter deck effect to occur. So if he is defeated in combat he goes to the discard pile before that happens.  Discarding defeated enemies happens during the combat phase. Also the return to encounter deck effect only occurs if he is revealed as a shadow card and not if he is revealed as a normal enemy during the quest phase.
