1. is the shadow card is considered in play? for examlpe,while the hunters from mordor attacking,the shadow card revealed is signs of gollum,whether the ATK of the enemy is raised.
2.in the following situation:Eomund with one damage on it commits to a quest then reveal Sleeping Sentry. I doubt if I can trigger the ability of Eomund after the treachery resolved to ready other Rohan characters.I notice the text of the Sleeping Sentry is” When Revealed: Deal 1 damage to each exhausted character. Then, exhaust all ready characters.There is a “then” between the two effects.I wonder whether the first effect should be resolved,in that case the ability of Eomund would be useless
Ps: Sleeping Sentry is relly a disaster,the shadow effect is even worsesorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

1. No

2. Yes, it would be pointless in that scenario. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
They happen in the sequence it is written on the card.

PS: Pack more anti-shadow! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Hope it helps.

I'm in doubt on this case, because i don't know if the "then…" should be resolved first or after the response of Eomund. Or even if they are "doable" at the same time and in that case if the first playre decides which to resolve first.

 

If this was the case then Eomund's response would be great… But, as i said, i'm in doubt about this one…
