# [LOTR LCG playmat](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175303-lotr-lcg-playmat/)

## 1 [redsavina2 on May 5, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175303-lotr-lcg-playmat/?do=findComment&comment=1606880)

I have about 1/3 of the LOTR LCG content, and want to increase the frequency in playing this awesome game.

 

Whenever I play card games, I like to have a themed playmat to go along with the game, and to make using the cards easier.

 

Is there any way to obtain official themed playmats for this game without spending $39.99 plus shipping in ebay, or using a print company?  Would be nice if FFG had them on their website for $19.99.  Maybe I just cant find them?

Yep, this comes up every so often - there are quite a few of us who would like one, and more art sleeves. As far as I know the only way of getting an official playmat at the moment is to pay overprice on eBay or attending a Fellowship event.

Never have used a play mat but I would buy one.

I picked up this one.

I am going to use it for the encounter deck, staging area, and current location.

 

Now I need 2 cool LotR playmats for playing 2 players, or for playing solo with 2 hands.

 

At least this is a good start.

I had this one [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/911102/geckoths-playmat] printed at InkedPlaymats, as staging area. Very pleased with it! I'll probably order again, but I'm having trouble finding good artwork with high enough resolution. It needs to be 3675 x 2175 with 150 PPI, and I'm having little luck on both Google and Deviantart. If anyone knows of a resource with high-res LotR artwork, I'd be thrilled.

Theres a double sized two player mat on BGG somewhere (sorry on tablet so not easy to go check) which is truly stunning. Sadly theres only inkedplaymats that print that size and when you add the cost to the international postage plus import taxes it gets quite expensive.

Great looking playmat though (with small spelling mistake I believe)

Myself I got fed up of hoping ffg would announce some so ive ordered a big square of poker table green baize/felt cloth. My two warcraft playmats have been doing well but the theme is just off so i decided poker cloth would be neutral.

There is always the option you could scan your own in at high res. Cheap bookshops here often have tolkien based stuff so they may do there too.

Or you could try mosaic and scan every AP box and use photoshop to stitch them all together to make playmat size (i like boxart its a shame it doesnt go into my card case)

That would be way awesome.  Too bad I dont have any photoshop skills or I would totally go for that.

Looks like a new LOTR event is on the horizon.

 

I have never been to one of these before, but it looks like you get a sweet looking playmat, a promo deck, and a promo card.

 

I emailed like 8 local game shops in my area, hoping that at least 2 or so will actually order the materials and have them available in November.  I have never seen anyone actually playing this game in a shop, so if a couple stores order them, maybe I can snag a few playmats. I would like to have enough to host a 4 player game, with LOTR themed playmats.

I may be wrong, but i think each store kit only has one playmat, the idea being it is a prize for winning the event, with more numerous smaller prizes such as alternate art cards.

So I dont know if some stores order multiple kits, but the mats might not be fully easy to come by.

I could be wrong though.

Prize for winning? It's coop

Unless FFG makes a significant change from how the event was run last year, the playmat for the 2015 Fellowship Event will be available to all who register and attend the event. To be clear, each paid attendee at the 2014 Fog on the Barrow Downs Fellowship Event received the following:

1 copy of the Fog on the Barrow Downs quest

1 copy of the alternate art Aragorn card (this came enclosed with the Fog on the Barrow Downs quest)

1 copy of the Black Riders-themed playmat.

Regarding playstyle - The 2015 Fellowship Event wil almost certainly be a cooperative experience, wherein groups of players work together to make their way through the quest, unless FFG has made a significant change from 2014. The 2014 Fellowship event was entirely cooperative. There were no competitive events and the store kit materials were distributed to all participants. Players did not have to earn the quest, the alt art card, or the playmat through some sort of competitive system. They simply received all three items by paying the registration fee and attending the event. I could be wrong, but it seems quite unlikely FFG will shift away from this system, especially for a cooperative game.

I urge folks who might be new to the game to reach out to FFG and your fellow players in the community if you have question about the 2015 Fellowship Event. Many of us here on the forums played in last year's Fellowship Event and should be able to help with questions. And I'm sure FFG would happily answer your questions, too. It's possible things will be different from last year, but given the game's cooperative format, this seems unlikely.

Thats awesome and apologies for me getting it wrong.

Oh yes and I know its co-op but those threads discussing best scores etc do seem to imply there can be a certain aspect of competition applied if needed :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Very glad i was wrong on this, all sounds an excellent package!

Being at Gen Con this year, it was awesome seeing 8 (yes 8!) playmats for AGOT second edition on sale (I picked up 2), one for each house. So it's definitely feasible for FFG to do ones for LOTR LCG and just outright sell them. Whether or not they think it's worth the time and effort is another matter, I suppose.

## 14 [Rob_Oz on August 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175303-lotr-lcg-playmat/?do=findComment&comment=1754511)

I would think that FFG must at least be considering sellingLOTR playmats, as the game seems to be doing quite well for them. A cursory glance at the numbers for the Living Card Game forums shows that Lord of the Rings has the 2nd most topics (AGOT is first) and has the most replies to topics (AGOT is 2nd) by a pretty wide margin. Obviously, this isn't any sort of detailed statistical analysis, but on the surface it sure seems like LOTR is a solid revenue stream for them. I think the fact that they are doing a 2nd Fellowship Event in 2015 also shows the game is doing well. So yeah, hopefully we might see playmats for sale in the future.

 

Quick note on my aforementioned post on the play-style of the Fellowship Event. I should clarify that while the 2014 FE wasn't promoted as a competitive event its entirely possible that players at last year's event may have played in a competitive style. This didn't happen at our event in the Washington D.C. area, but I can't speak about other locations. And folks could certainly elect to do so this year, too. I was just trying to clarify that the swag is given to everyone who pays and shows up. You don't have to win it. The registration cost for our Fellowship Event last year was $20. Hopefully its about the same this year.

Anyone know of an event in Indiana I've checked two local stores in Indianapolis and there not having it.

I uploaded an updated copy of the 2 player playmat with words edited and fixed, as well as cleaning up any spots\artifacts.  Note - I didn't create the original playmat, I onlyw edited the existing one.   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I would love to have that legolas playmat, but I live in brazil, we have to pay like 200 bucks for the playmat plus 100 for taxes, so consider yourselves lucky!
