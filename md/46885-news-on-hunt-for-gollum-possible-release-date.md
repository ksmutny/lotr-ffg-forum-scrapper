FFG is touting June 10-12 as sneak peek days for chosen stores. Does that mean that we won't see the pack until late June? Wow, dissapointing, if that's the case.

Looks like LotR might have been affected by the printing delays that postponed AGoT latest cycle start until couple weeks ago. Interesting they are doing this. I have never seen this for any of the other LCG's but certainly a good way to promote the game.

Knowing that there's no way that my local game store would hold this event, my inner nerd weeps at the news of a late June release :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

I agree. I live in Belgium, and as the preview kit isn't available for belgian retailers, this is just a downer. The game is experiencing a hype right now, I know my shopkeeper wants to cash in on this right away because there is a huge demand for the expansion packs. But reading this news... People over here are going to be really disappointed by this, especially since we don't have the option to host a preview event.

ha! my 'nearest' store is about 300miles away from me, and this all reminds me of the south park episode where cartman buys a theme park then doesnt let anyone in, making them go mad with tension, then he lets them in and makes tons of money- maybe FFG is trying this by making us wait? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

looks like UK can't host events either, shame.

 Hey, at least most of y'all are complaining due to geographical constraints. I have 2 comic/card shops in town that won't do a promo card event unless it's for Wizards of the Coast. More LotR, less Yu-Gi-Oh please!

Do you think FFG will compile a list of participating stores on their site? I don't even know too many FLGS so if one nearby is holding this event, I'd like to go.

"On May 27th, we will stop accepting applications. On May 31st, we will list the participating venues here on our website."

I'm anxiously awaiting this list as well, since I'm ready and willing to drive up to 3 hours to go to one of these.

O I know the pain of that. Though replace Yu-Gi-Oh with the WoW:TCG. I mean the shop owners are good guys and they sound interested in LCG's but they agree with me that it would take a long time to convince others to play. Hopefully another shop I frequent near my work will be hosting an event. SHOUT OUT TO 401 Games in Toronto!

The list of international distributors has some new ones added to it.
