Â when an ally states that a progress token will be added to each location in the staging area when questing, does that include the location you are at? and does it include the main quest as well? cheers

It would only be any location cards in the staging area. Once you travel to a location it is no longer part of the staging area. Rulebook page 15 "Phase 4: Travel"
