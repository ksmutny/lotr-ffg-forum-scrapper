We play in a group of 4 of us. We have 2 core sets. Can you have 3 Gandalf cards in your deck? I know you can only play 1 at a time. Thx in advance.

If someone asks a question and you're just going to tell them to read the rules, may I suggest you provide a page number at least?. The rules don't actually specifically state how many copies of Gandalf can be included in a deck, it does however state on page 27 that "no more than 3 copies of any card by title can be included in a player's deck".

^Rude.^

OP, you are allowed 3 copies of any card in your deck.

 IMO what is rude is not reading rules that hard working people put a lot of effort into making and outlining for our benefit and then going on the boards wasting space asking questions that are easily found had you read those hard working peoples product.  Nuff said.

@Dwnhmcntryboy and TheRomance_Screw both of you little punks! I was just wondering because it is a neutral card and did not know if i missed something somewhere and just wanted to be sure. Now stop taking up space that hard working people like myself use scince it is available.

Well said. If you don't like the question don't answer. There's no such thing as a stupid question only stupid answers!

The LOTR forum has a rumor for being one of the best on FFG regarding polite and helpfull people. And then there's of cause always some troublemakers among us...just ignore them and don't wast time and space on them :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] welcome to the game

First of all, he did answer the question.  Secondly, his point is completely valid -- as with any other forum, if you're going to ask a question, it is courteous to see if the topic has not already been covered; use the resources that have already been provided.  I'm not saying that it wasn't the case here, but the way the question was initially phrased, it had sounded like he hadn't even read the basic rules.  And I don't see a need be offended or call people "punks."

Being courteous goes both ways.

If you don't want to answer questions that have already been answered or can be found in the rules, don't reply. It doesn't effect you. Move on to another thread. Simple.

Others will come along and answer. And others who need the answer will come along and see it before it falls off the first forum page.

We don't need this forum to become just another forum where new players are hesitant to interact. We can spend our time on better pursuits, like convincing Glaurung that this is the hardest game he's ever played by using Inception and planting the seed of the idea. We'll need an architect.

It's not about wanting to or not wanting to answer the question, it is about preserving the integrity of the message board.  In other forums, FAQs are stickied with a big "READ FIRST" label, and moderators close threads for repeated questions.  I realize the "Unofficial FAQ" thread isn't stickied here, and yes not everyone has read everything everywhere in the rules/errata/FAQ, but at the same time we should encourage people to do so, which will allow fresh discussions to take place and enable those threads to be more readily viewable.  So yes, it does affect me and it affects everyone else who frequents these forums.  As I've said, it's more about how the OP framed his original question -- it came across as "I don't want to take the time to read what others have already taken the time to answer."  It originally seemed to be more of a question of what the rules were as opposed to how to interpret them.

## 12 [silverhand77 on November 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56242-gandalf-card-question/?do=findComment&comment=555963)

I think an (possibly incorrect)  assumption has been made that the OP has not read the rules. I myself have read and re-read the rules and official FAQ quite a few times and I still miss things. For example, until recently I missed the part on page 8 of the rules where it says that a resource icon indicates to which sphere the hero card itself belongs and was play songs as though they only provided a resource token which meant that sphere specific cards such as A Burning Brand couldn't be attached to a hero like Aragorn (Leadership) even if he had the song of wisdom attached - this is clearly wrong as was pointed out to me when I asked about it on this forum. 

One thing to consider is that people learn in different ways, some people absorb information more efficiently by asking questions than reading rules. Some people may simply need the information presented in a slightly different way. In my opnion, it doesn't do anything to create a sense of community to respond by saying "yes, read the rules please" If you can't be bothered taking the time to explain properly, then leave it to someone else.

I agree that we should encourage people to read the rules, however as I said in my previous post, it would be courteous to provide a page number at the very least. I also agree that we need to treat each other with respect (even if we have taken offence).

It is one thing to tell people to check the forum to see if anything has previously been posted but this forum in my opinion doesn't have a particularly user friendly search function and it can take quite some time to find what you are looking for. It can be much quicker to simply create a new topic and ask your question.

@ the OP, please don't be put off by the unhelpfulness of the two "punks" as you called them. There are many of us who are more than happy to answer any questions you might have. The only stupid question is the one you dont ask. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I disagree that there are no stupid questions. I do agree, though, that it's preferable to ignore them rather than giving impolite, unhelpful answers.

Sure I'll try and find the thread for you, but it might take some time. Out of curiosity, what was your interpretation?

 You're allowed to have three copies of Gandalf in each deck, but with two core sets and four players you might have a bit of trouble with the math there. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]
