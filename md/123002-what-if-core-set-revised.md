# [What if: Core Set Revised](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123002-what-if-core-set-revised/)

There was some similar thread some time ago, but now I decided to make it into "flesh".

So, what would I do if FFG tasked me with revising player cards of the core set to bring them up to par with modern cards:

Omg, I want them!

Nice work man!

I'd love to see some more cards, like longbeard orc slayer. Maybe just for the art because there is a dead Dwarf in the picture, while the card's name is Orc Slayer..

Most of these are pretty good and I agree with them. But I have some additional opinions:

 

- Silverlode Archer should cost 2

- Making Gandalf not 'sneakable' makes me sad. It's sensible, but sad. Another solution might just be to lower the numbers on his ability: 2 cards, 2 damage, or 3 threat.

- Unexpected Courage should cost 3 (which may be something good for Steward of Gondor too)

- Thematically, I really like the changes to Fortune or Fate, but it really kills Caldara decks and makes her so much less useable. Restricted the card from being reused by Dwarven Tomb is probably a good idea, but limiting it to 1 per deck will kill its chances of seeing the light of day.

Great Job. Blade mastery seems a bit OP and there's a bit of sphere mixing(Spirit event with drawing cards), but I love it all

-With new Silvan synergy going on and potential to utilize it's willpower, Silverlode archer would be too much for the cost of 2.

-What makes me more sad is fact of the Leadershit sphere getting unfair advantage by allowing it to get Gandalf's bonuses just for 1 resource. What makes me even more sad is the fact that it destroys any gameplay Sneak Attack can offer, no one will use it on anything but Gandalf unless situation is dire. 

-The main problem of Courage was that a lot of courages were slapped onto one hero (like Beregond) which then wrecked. Limiting it to 1 per hero fixes this problem, no need for increasing the cost in my eyes. 

-You may be right, restricting to 1 per deck might be too much. Most players wouldn't notice, though, as there is only 1 copy in the core set available :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Note that Blade Mastery can only target warriors and is restricted to once per phase... and where else you're gonna use it if not in the combat phase? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

As for spirit event drawing cards, I think you're talking about an attachment, and there is already official Ancient Mathom (spirit attachment that draws cards) and several more.

- While I agree that moving him to 2 resources puts him at a higher power rating than most of the new Silvan cards (stat-wise), I also think that his 3 cost makes him weaker than most of the Silvan allies. Since he has no "enters play" ability, he likely won't be targeted by the Silvan events, so he'll likely only get the stat boost once. If you compare him to Orophin, who also costs 3 and has ranged, Silverlode archer is losing by 2 stat points. Orophin being unique is a factor here, but Orophin also has an "enters play" ability. If he costs 3, I'm not likely going to play Silverlode Archer. If he costs 2, I almost assuredly will.

 

- Yea I totally agree that Leadership has a ridiculous advantage with Sneak Attack. It's just that Gandalf has been on the decline lately, and this just shoves him out the door almost completely.

 

- I don't really see that as an issue. In 3 or 4 player games where only 1 deck has a decent defender, then I can see that coming up, but in 1 and 2 player games, that's pretty rare. In the instance of a 3 or 4 player game, I kinda view this as a decent strategy that allows each deck to focus on their role better, even if it feels a little cheap; you're still giving yourself a single point of failure, which is a problem in itself. My biggest issue with Unexpected Courage right now is that its cost is low for its ability when compared to other readying abilities. Many other readying effects are 1-time effects and cost 0 or 1. Rohan Warhorse is some strong restrictions, so its cost of 1 seems appropriate. Steed of the Mark costs 1 each time you use it and also has some restrictions. Just to make it comparable to most other readying effects, I'd say making it cost 3 would be fair because you generally get 3 or more uses out of it per game.

Those cards are absolutly amazing, but some of them i would edit:

 

-Brok ironfist´s cost should be 5 to make it´s ability more usefull

-Beorn´s hospitalitys art (i myself don´t like it, but it´s just my opinion of this card)

-Gandalf´s search should be 1 (i think it would be too op otherwise)

-Blade of Gondolin should have the old art, i like it more than the new one

-Blade mastery should have cost of 1 instead of 0.

 

And please do more of these they are so cool :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

joezim007

 

-Leadershit is a resource-rich sphere and stuff of that sphere tends to be on the pricier side sometimes. Also, Orophin is an unique ally, unique allies are known for getting away with doing more for less cost. This archer main aim is to give leadershit some multiplayer finesse, he was not meant for the Silvan synergy, but want it or not, he can be a part of it, just not as good as guys designed specificly for it.

-Well, I, for one, think that Steed of the Mark should have costed 0 in the first place :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Rohan Warhorse it tactics, let's not forget it. If Unexpected Courage would cost 3, then it would be hard to play it in non-monospirit decks, and in monospirit ones it would take away entire turn worth of resources. Sorry, but right now I consider Unexpected Courage as a strong, but not overpowered card to give it such cost. 

 

Dwarf king Bronze beard

 

-The thing with Brok is that designers originally wanted for him to be put into play due to his response, hence such big printed cost. What I was trying to achieve here is an unique ally with decent enough stats-to-cost ratio to be a valid option to play from hand AND a conditional way to put him into play for free, if it happens.

-Beorn's Hospitality art was intended as a joke, because it depicts exactly the opposite of the card's meaning :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Just couldn't helped myself when I saw it.

-Why? It lends just 1 card and some reorganizing stuff, too conditional to put a price tag on it. Think like Daeron's Runes.

-A good elven blade was extremely hard to find, that's the best I could muster. If I had access to old art, I would definetely use it.

-Blade Mastery sort of costs 1, it's also inferior to other stat-giving events present around.

I love the irony on Beorn's Hospitality.

 

I think the Blade Mastery is good.  If it were +2 At AND +2 Df it would be overpowered on Boromir.

Sorry, but right now I consider Unexpected Courage as a strong, but not overpowered card to give it such cost.

 

- The only reason Silverlode Archer is better than the Silvan card designed for the synergy is because he has 1 more stat point than most of the 2-cost Silvan allies. The reason for that is because those Silvan allies are designed to pop in and out and consistently receive Celeborn's bonus stats. Silverlode Archer is specifically designed to stick around (especially with that cost of 3), so he won't be getting that constant stat boost. The only other 3-cost Leadership ally with such low stats is Son of Arnor, who is largely a dud. His ability is good enough that you want it on a higher-cost character, so I guess instead of lowering his cost to 2, I say throw him another hit point. He's in a small minority of 3-cost allies with only 1 hit point.

 

- Even if Steed of the Mark did cost 0, it'd end up having a higher cost than Unexpected Courage most of the time anyway due to its ability's cost. Rohan Warhorse being Tactics should actually command a higher cost (supply and demand). The reason I want to nerf Unexpected Courage is because I think it's overplayed and gives us no reason to want to use the alternatives. Yes, 3 resources is difficult for a 2-sphere deck to pay for, but far from impossible. It actually can become easier if you pair it with Leadership and send Steward of Gondor over to a Spirit Hero. Unexpected Courage is a powerful card and in my opinion it totally deserves a cost of 3, with or without the "limit 1 per character" restriction.

Ok, ok, I'll remove "limit 1 per deck". Adding it to the victory display is punishing enough, I guess.

 

As for the Silverlode Archer, adding 1 hit point makes most sense to me because there is too dam few Silvan allies who can benefir from Silvan Tracker. And both Silverlode Archer and Silvan Tracker hailing from the first cycle, it would make most of the sense if Silverlode Archer could utilize Tracker's ability.

Yeah, that Longbeard will definitly slay some Orcs! Thanks fot that!

For the rest, I really agree a lot woth joezim about Silverlode. I think it cool that Gadnalf and Leadership have a combo, because it is his sign that belongs to the LeadershiP sphere.

I do not really understand why you insist on typing **** but I guess you don't like the sphere or it is meant as a joke.

Yeah, the combo might be "cool" from the flavor viewpoint and all that stuff, but it's definitely not from the game health viewpoint. 

 

Not that I don't like leadershit for any bad reason, I don't like it because it's most suitable sphere for solo, thus being most frequently used all around. And don't get me wrong, I use it, I don't like it in a good way.

Great work on these!

 

Makes me laugh that the best version of Gandalf is Gandalf. Nevermind! I see the change. That does add some more balance in.

 

I agree with some of the comments about Blade Mastery. I would take out the option to return it to hand. I could see some great combos with Eomer/Boromir possible with it as is.

 

I also think Blade of Gondolin needs some curbing. Either cost 2 or just keep it as it was. What if it was the reverse of the old one? 1 cost, +1 attack, but only +1 progress if you kill an orc? 

 

But I love this. Thanks for the time you put (and are putting) in. I will be very tempted to print out a set of these.

The problem with current blade mastery is that it gives insufficient stats to the most of the crowd and costs whopping 1 while doing that. Just to compare it with a few other stat givers even from the same sphere:

-Behind the Strong Walls - it restricted to Gondor characters, but it gives +1 Defnese and +X, where X is the stat you're going to use with next action of that character, as he just got readied;

-Halfling Determination - restricted to hobbits, but grants +2 of every stat, including Willpower, so craved by Tactics sphere;

-Khazad! Khazad! - restricted to Dwards, but grants +3 of attack and is free.

So, what Blade Mastery does is gives one of the Warriors +2 Attack OR +2 Defense ONCE per phase, meaning no overstacking. If you're gonna play it each round and trigger it's return-to-hand ability, you're essentially bringing yourself down to 2 resources per turn instead of 3.

 

As for the Blade of Gondolin, it's fine in comparison to other modern weapons. Modern weapons usually cost 1 and give +1 attack upfront, and either +1 conditional one (like enemy's engagement cost must be higher than your threat) or some bonus effect (like Dwarrowdelf Axe), and thats exactly where Blade of Gondolin falls in. Don't look at the Dwarven Axe, it died as soon Dwarrowdelf Axe got released. And lowering it's cost won't even help, as even then Dwarrowdelf Axe will do it's work better, it'll be a tough one to rework Dwarven Axe so it can fit as a valid choice into the modern arsenal of weapons.

Okay, I buy the argument for Blade Mastery! Especially with resource-scare tactics, it would be a hard choice to lose 1 resource/round. 

 

For the Blade: Each of the 1-cost weapons has a trait restriction or a conditional cause (like higher threat for the enemy). I just think it needs either a trait restriction or the change I suggested above to match what is currently out there.

These 3 versions are closest things to what I can bring myself to nerfing the Blade of Gondolin:

In the terms of the Core Set, restricting Blade of Gondolin to Warriors would be perfectly fine, as all Core Tactics heroes are Warriors, and there is 1 Warrior in each other sphere, Dunhere, Glorfindel and Theodred. 

 

Updated Brok Ironfist slightly, so he feels more consistent.

I might say 8 or lower just because there are a lot of really good heroes at 9, but that would limit the number of core set heroes that it works with to 4. That would probably too restrictive.

Thanks for considering the feedback about the Blade! I like the first one. I think the need to exhaust it is a restriction enough to warrant the cost.

The only thing that bugs me about the need to exhaust Blade of Gondolin to trigger the resource placement is indirect nerf of Foe-Hammer and Goblin-Cleaver. Just limiting effect to once per phase/round would solve the issue, but it sounds just silly.

You could simply limit the Blade to once per round instead of exhausting it.

To Daughter of Nimrodel. Is that such a bad wording?

The only reason that wording didn't work nicely is because the hero was the last character talked about. I love how you can control the amount of damage healed by boosting her willpower. Most of the peole wont bother, but sometimes it will come in handy.

Condition

Attach to a hero. Attached hero gets +1 Willpower.

Giving Willpower instad of taking it might be the way to put it up to par and make worth including. By now, while reviewing it, I reached this state:

Well, Fast Hitch is one of the cards that could benefit from Common Cause that I had in mind while turning it into the attachment. Common Cause is limited to 1 hero and 1 time per turn, so nothing gamebreaking. Card games are really about combos and card synergies, aren't they?

Not a real fan of all these revisions.

I think it is a bad idea, and I wouldn't want to see these cards. Only possibility of tweaking all the existing cards is creating a second line of cards which people would print themselves. I find this something we shouldn't encourage. If players want to do this for their plays at home, let them be. But don't make it public.

I think Fantasy Flight does a great job, and they try to keep as much cards alive as possible. There will always be cards we won't use at all and some that are too strong. The group of cards referred to by this topic is pretty small and building a set which people can use at home to replace the existing ones makes me feel sad.

So far my opinion.

I'm pretty sure this was all supposed to be hypothetical anyway. This is simply how MyNeighbourTrololo would "fix" the old Core Set cards if FFG hired him to do so, which I don't see happening, even if he has good ideas.

I understand the hypothetical idea of this all.

But if you would create 300 revised cards in the proper format, spread them by this forum, you are actually creating a new line of player cards instead of just critisising/discussing them.

Sure this example is exagerated, but it is only to make the point more clear. I think critisising cards is fine, just as suggesting probable improvements, but creating these revised cards seems wrong to me.

I really like the idea of discussing/improving cards, but building revised sets is 1 bridge too far (even if just hypothical). If you really like those revised card then you can make them yourself, but don't spread them by any forum/website.

I think he's essentially saying that you're creating an entire custom set of cards and that it's detracting from the real product, so it shouldn't be made public. Apparently Jban hasn't heard about the massive custom First Age set. I see nothing wrong with publicly releasing custom card sets, even if they are specifically designed to replace certain current cards in the pool, especially if the original card was being underused or overused.

 

If this was a competitive card game and these cards were being allowed in tournaments, then I might have something to say against them, but otherwise, there is no reason we can't share the cards we came up with.

## 54 [Jban on September 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123002-what-if-core-set-revised/?do=findComment&comment=1281198)

I have heard of The First Age set, just as I know of custom quests which are available in OCTGN. But I make a difference in creating new ideas for the developers to be inspired, or by just creating Beta-versions of things that allready exist. Since the second interferes with the existing products of Fantasy Flight Games I find it inapropriate to share these cards.

So far my opinion.

But searching there is extremely tricky. When you search for something - it will mostly never display a result you're looking for.

And sometime if art looks good but not quite matches the theme - I check the whole gallery of an artist in case he has some more fitting art.

Well, that's a huge balance question. Old SoG costed 2 and immediately refilled this cost by it's active, essenitally costing 0 but requiring at least 2 leadershit resources in play. The one I made cannot give you resources instantly unless you've setup specifically to trigger it's response. I want SoG to be reliable resource income source with a bit of extra if you do something it wants you to do, but I don't want to punish the players who don't do it. If I price SoG with 1, then, without response "triggerment", it will start producing net income on the second turn after it was played (you attach SoG, next resource phase - you got 1 which you spent to play it, next resource phase - you got 1 again, which is now actual income), and that's the thing I want to avoid here.

Would the Steward of Gondor response be triggered by the passive effect? I know it's not designed to do that, but it is a card effect adding a resource.

 

Definitely like the changes to it though.

I specifically worded it as "collects" which does not equals "add". It's like all this stuff with moving resources, which is not considered as being added for the purposes of triggering responses and stuff.

Resourceful is not unique, you can stack those for a great cumulative effect. Steward of Gondor is just one on the board. Resourceful is also neutral, while SoG is not. I added the trait just for laughs, because Denethor from core set had it and it never mentioned anywhere (sometimes I even wonder why they added the Steward trait while Noble covers it pretty much).

Which is an alternative position that I also presented. Maybe you missed it.

My suggestion was to link it to willpower 1 rather than threat, but that's much of a muchness. I believe we're both going for the same theme of making it work on characters that seem to be less courageous). 

I would support the card in this form.

If you can only use the readying once before you have to shuffle it, I think it could be reduced to a cost of 1. Otherwise, that's pretty cool. Kinda odd thematically though. You have "minor courage" which gives you +1wp, then when you really work up your courage and ready yourself, you lose the willpower...

I guess Unexpected Courage being one-time use makes sense. How many times can it really be unexpected?

I agree that this should be avoided, but Cram is discarded and offers no other benefits. The "Favor of the Unexpected Lady Courage" card is shuffled for potential re-use and offers 1 willpower while you wait to use it. Of course, I'd prefer to have easily repeatable readying, so even if I'm not against this card, I don't want to replace Unexpected Courage with it. Just supplement. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

We already have that card in the game. It's called Miruvor.

Sorta... yea.

For reasons I can't fathom, you seem to have objections to "great" cards. All the changes you call for would accomplish is to make the core set less appealing and cripple player decks that require those cards to beat the encounter cards designed to challenge those specific combos.

Can you be more specific?

That is kind of the point though in a way. The core set has a lot of really powerful cards and for players who go out and buy three core sets, they can build really strong decks based on the scenario at hand. I have watched a large number of youtube videos and seen a lot of deck lists since I have started playing this over a year ago, but I have to take each with a grain of salt because even though I have every quest essentially, I only have 1 core set and I don't proxy. It has always baffled me that a lot of folks say they don't like how easy something like Easy Mode can make a game, but have no problem putting Glorfindel and LoV in 95% of their decks and then, along with friends, getting like 4 Unexpected Courage's on Beregond. Now it is definitely within the rules of the game to play it that way, but it isn't always the most fun or the most challenging and part of the reason, in my opinion, is because some of the cards are too powerful (when someone buys multiple core sets - because, again, that is when the most powerful cards come out, like unexpected courage, celebrian stone, etc.). 

 

I like the idea of hypothetically reducing some of the luster of some of the core set cards. For the record, I don't think that the core set itself had much problems, but I think when you consider how many people buy 3, some of those cards became too powerful.  I, myself, would have preferred a core set with three copies of every card and a little less powerful cards as a result, such as what Trololo and others have suggested.

Appreciate and respect what you guys are saying but disagree. Out of curiosity why won't you proxy cards DC?
I personally have 1 core and for around $20 bought a pack of cards that is x1 of each of the cards in the core set you get x2 of. I also proxy a second unexpected courage (but don't run three just the two) and proxy upcoming cards not yet released. This works super well and is very cheap and easy to do. It eliminates the issue of only having one core set as I find that other than unexpected courage the x2 of cards are better and more important than the x1 of cards in the core set.. The core set quests are also pretty **** hard (minus the first) if you only have the core set and would be even harder if core set player cards were weaker.

Also do you play nightmare? Certain nightmare quests require you to bring your absolute a game or you will get stomped. Without some of the powerhouse core cards (the way they are now) they would be hard to a point that I think would not be fun.

Please, note that while I "nerfed" some spotlights of core set, I bumped a lot of weakling of core set to the adequate state, which kinda balances things out, especially for a core set. When I made those changes, I always kept the core set stand-alone in mind.

Good point, you did make a lot of almost unusable cards much better. Really like some of them actually especially Silverlode Archer, Blade of Gondolin and Ever Vigilant. I think more than anything though its traits that should have been done properly in the core set.
