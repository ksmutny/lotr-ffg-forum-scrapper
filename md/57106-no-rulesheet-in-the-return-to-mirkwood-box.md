Hey guys, I picked up my RtM today and when I opened it to sleeve the cards, there wasn't a rulesheet in the box.  Is this true for everyone?  The other 5 boxes had 1 page rulesheets.  Is mine missing or does RtM just use rules already explained and so they left it out?

yeah i know, it was in to explain how to guard gollum, so you may need it, though you can probably see it online if you're not bothered

I just checked the support section and it hasn't been posted yet. If anyone has it, may I suggest posting it so we can help our fellow player out? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks guys, I appreciate it.  There are probably copyright issues with trying to post it.  I'll call them on Monday and see if I can get them to send me a copy.  Weird, though...this is the first FFG product that had rules missing.

For anyone interested, here's the rulesheet contents that apply to the game:

"Guarding Gollum"

"During this quest, players are instructed to guard the Gollum objective card.  At the beginning of the game, the players choose one player to guard Gollum. This player places the Gollum objective card in front of him to represent that he is guarding it. Various effects in the encounter and quest deck, as well as the effect on Gollum itself, interact with the player who is guarding Gollum." 

"Once a player is guarding Gollum, that player cannot relinquish the responsibility to another player unless card text allows, or in some cases, mandates a change. The text on the Gollum objective itself allows the players to choose a new guard at the end of each game round."

"The Gollum objective has hit points, and it is possible that he will be destroyed during the quest. If Gollum is destroyed, or leaves play for any reason, the players have lost the game. Gollum cannot be used to attack, defend, or commit to a quest. Otherwise, Gollum is considered an ally character under the control of the player guarding him. Card effects that affect allies do affect him, and any attachment that can be played on an ally can be played on Gollum."

Thanks Titan!  Now we can try out the scenario.
