Hi there,

Can someone fully explain how travel works? If there isn't any active location in play, the first player chooses one that he wants to travel automatically making that location the active one and triggering it's effect, right?

Then the players send the characters they want there by exhausting them, add their will and compare it against the threat level of all the cards in the staging area (the location they are traveling too isn't there anymore). So what happens next?

If the players have more will than threat in staging area we add exploration tokens to the location, if we place more tokens than the cost of the location we resolve it and discard it? This will leave us with the option of traveling to a new location the next turn, right?

If we have more will but don't pass the amount needed in the location then we place tokens and we can't travel to another location until we resolve this one, right?

And last but not least, if we have less will than threat in the staging then we don't add any tokens and what happens?

Thanks!

Javier

Firstly, the Travelling phase comes after the Quest phase - other than that you are right in what you are saying.

When questing, if the total threat is greater than your committed Willpower, then you raise your Threat dial by the difference.  If you choose not to commit any characters to the quest then you will have a Willpower of 0 when calculating this.

Yes, I know that the quest phase comes first. But now that I think off I have this question:

First turn, you quest and add points to the actual quest in case you have more will than threat. Then in your travel phase you select to travel to location #1, making the same check that you did, although with the characters you can and now the check is more easy since the travel location is not adding the threat, right?

Then on the second turn, you quest and if you have more will than the threat level in the staging area you add the tokens to the active location, right? And if that's not enough to overpass the location's level then on your travel phase you can't travel anywhere, right?

Thanks!

No, travel is just moving a location from the SA to the quest card, and carrying out any forced effects or responses arising from making that card the active location. You do not actually do anything else in the travel phase.

So, first turn: you quest with a location in the SA, and if successful add progress tokens directly to the quest card. Then you travel, by moving the location from the SA to the quest card.

Second turn: you quest, and if successful, you add resource tokens to the location rather than directly to the quest card. If you have gained more tokens than needed for the location, you add any remaining ones to the quest card.

Mount attachments with traveling bonus will be a great idea.Somethink like a Shadowfax or Asfaloth card saying:exhauste Shadowfax to place 2 progress tokens on the active location or on the quest card gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

Thanks a lot for that! Really clear. One last thing then: if you gain 8 tokens to flip a quest card (that just needs 6) and go to the other, does the new quest card gets those extra 2 tokens that you had left?

Thanks!

No, unfortunately you only add what is needed to resolve the current card, any excess is ignored.

Technically, yoiu can still apply those extras to the current quest in case you're blocked from completing it for whatever reason. But no, they do not carry over to the next quest.

Can you give an example of this? I don't fully understand the case...

In Scenario 2 you can't advance to stage 2 if a Hill Troll is still alive, so you might have more tokens than you need on the first stage of the quest, but with the HT still alive, can't make progress.

And if something is blocking your path, like not having the right number of objectives in scen 3, there are enemies and treachery cards that remove tokens from the quest, so adding the extra is like insurance.
