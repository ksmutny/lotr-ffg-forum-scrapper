# [[Custom Event] Visions of the Palantír](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59495-custom-event-visions-of-the-palant%C3%ADr/)

This is the card that is generating a lot of furor in my playgroup.

One says it is waaaaaaaaay overpower for just 2 resources since it lets you see what is coming and still lets you discard the worst of the cards there (so, in a vacuum, it's one powerful effect and a not-so-much by 2 resources), while another, in the exact opposite side, say it is actually too weak, because it makes you lose the game faster (by adding threat to the staging area and direct to yourself).

 

So, in a moment of desperation, I chose to came here and ask the opinions of some of the best players and greatest Tolkien's fans in the world. I am exaggerating, but still; there are a good bunch of great players and another of people who know a lot of Tolkien's work.

What do you guys think about it's 'pawaR' and flavor?

Here it is...  How did you do that split sphere thing?

Good! Thanks.

 

I used the 'pen tool' and the most useful tool in Photoshop (the eraser) to do the little sphere and the large rectangle.

The superimposed icons was messing with the opacity and overlaying the first (leadership) on the second (lore).

I can (somehow) send you the *.psd if you want.

You should probably specify what happens to the Encounter card(s) that isn't discard or revealed. I pick 5 to be X (I assume you can pick any number you want? FFG templating usually defines what X means on a given card), I discard 1 of those cards, reveal 2 of them, what do I do with the rest? Back to the top of the Encounter deck, or do I shuffle it?

You're right, X is any number you want.

And good point, I never tested this 'version' yet. What do you think is better?

 

The first template was much simpler (and in my opinion, way better):

"Action: Look at the top 5 cards of the Encounter deck. You may discard one. Put one of those cards into play in the Staging Area. Return the rest in any order. (or shuffle, I don't remember which one - but I believe it was the former)"

 

But my players like more flexible card, and sometimes I just go over the top and sh*t happens. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

This card is baddy worded and overly complex for the effect.... and you are talking about discarding 1 card but fail to say what happens to the other cards NOT discarded OR placed in the staging area... I'm assuming they go back on the top of the deck. How about this...

"Lore and Leadership resources must be used during the payment of this event.

Pay an additional X to look at the top X cards form the encounter deck. Choose 1 of these cards to be discarded and then place the remaining cards back in any order. Draw X cards divided by 2 (rounded up) and place in the staging area. Then raise your threat by 1."

Still, the entire "rounded up" thing is clunky at best. There are other problems though...

oh right... how about this then....

 

"[Lore Symbol] and [Leadership Symbol] must be used to play event

Choose any odd number to stand for X that is greater than 1.

Reveal to yourself X cards form the top of the encounter deck. Choose 1 of these cards to be discarded and then place 1/2 the cards back in any order and the rest into the staging area. Raise your threat by 1."

powerful card.. knowing what is coming in the encounter deck is crazy powerful, I think it should at least be "Then raise you threat by the number of cards placed in the staging area this way" Though it would prob be better to shuffle the cards back into the encounter deck.

I liked this last version of yours very much:

 

"[Lore Symbol] and [Leadership Symbol] must be used to play event

Choose any odd number to stand for X that is greater than 1.

Reveal to yourself X cards form the top of the encounter deck. Choose 1 of these cards to be discarded and then place 1/2 the cards back in any order and the rest into the staging area. Raise your threat by 1."

 

This is probably the most clean possible while still maintaining the original effects.

Thanks! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

 

EDIT:

 

Sooo, you can always edit the first post...

This is interesting! Maybe I'll post my homemade stuff someday.

NO, the edit function is time related... post on BoardGameGeeks or CardGameDB.. in fact I wish the entire LoTR community would just move to CardGameDB

Well, maybe one day, but now, you already convinced one. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Why would anyone use this card? Yes, you can get rid of a possible future threat, but by the cost of placing additional cards in the staging area. The threat cost is deniable. How about "look at the X topmost cards of the encounter deck, discard one of them and shuffle the encounter deck afterwards. Raise your threat by X".

i think the card needs work.. but I like the basic premise of the card... though it is obvious he is using the film version of the Palantíri.. heh heh... Anyway... the cards premise is cool,. the idea that you can see what the enemy is doing but at a cost of him seeing you. This is represented quite well in the fact that you can look at and order the encounter deck so you know what is coming at will at the cost of |them" knowing what you are doing, as represented by the new staging enemies.

The main problem I have is that the ability to know what is coming in the encounter deck is one of the most powerful effects in the game as it completely allows you to plan perfectly entire turns... you say why would you use this card? I say why would you ever NOT use it.. way to powerful.

Still general idea of the card is good. As i said before, if you took away putting ordered cards on the top of the deck it would be much better... shuffle those cards back instead and the card becomes much better imo, yet still can fit the "theme" of the Palantíri.
