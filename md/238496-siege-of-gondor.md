So my friend and I finished Passing of the Grey Company and with some excitement I turned to Siege of Gondor thinking it would recreate the epic siege of Minas Tiriith, only to discover that it is in fact Battle of Pelargir or perhaps Corsair Invasion, ie nothing siege related. Â Am I missing something?

Nope. Kinda a bummer huh? I hope they have a LOTR part 12.1(?) for the actual siege of MT. Like what they did in TFotR for the barrow downs and the old forest, do it in a fellowship event or GENCON in 2017.

Every quest has the name of a book chapter and, not having an actual chapter that describes that part, they just name it so.
