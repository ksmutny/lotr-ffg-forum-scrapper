 Anybody have any guesses as to who the new hero will be? Is the general consensus that it will be Elladan? Also, what other heroes do you think we will see or want to see this cycle? happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 I think that we are going to get Elladan in Road to Rivendell, and that the art is the one on the adventure box:

Elladan [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/Dwarrowdelf/road-to-rivendell/box-MEC10-left.png]

Also, it could be great that his stats should be:

Threat 10, Willpower 2, Attack 1, Defense 2, and 4 HP, and with Elrohir in play, he gets +2 Attack. And a response to ready him with 1 of his resources after being declared as attacker.

It could make a great match with his twin brother gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 I think that'd make for a pretty neat hero Robert, so here's hoping. Lol... and I hope it's this pack. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

i did an analysis thread the other month of what i thought the heros would be for this cycle- and was actually spot on with the brothers.

i also think we'll see more dwarves of thorins co.

I agree with Robert's predictions, but I want to throw out that I think he will be a tactics hero.

Yes, I forgot to write it, but I was thinking in Tactics too.

I think your guesses are well founded.

Then, do others also find Elrohir one of the most un-impressive heroes so far? I so much wished to see more Elves (and especially Noldor) but just like Glorfindel Elrohir seems to be super weak. And I fear Elladan will not help things out that much.

Just consider, for the cost of 10, you get someone to either quest for 2 (compare to Frodo, not to mention Éowyn, Bifur or Glóin with Dáin about), or he can defend even if for 3 (compare to Dáin or Denethor), PAY! for his ability just to defend again or attack for 2, again compare to either Boromir or Imrahil who ready so much more effectively.

With the new Secrecy mechanic, I wouldn't be suprised to see them make Elladan a quest character instead of a carbon copy of Elrohir. It would be great to run just these two. Have Elladan quest, and use Elrohir for defense, then attack. They would have to mix in some way to keep your threat below 20 (I doubt Elladan will be Spirit).

But, if they do make him the attack version of his brother, it would make for a pretty decent Noldor only deck with Glorfindel mixed in. High starting threat, but one good quest, defense, and attack character for a tri-sphere deck.

## 10 [Bomb on March 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606396)

I think making him a quest character would be a pretty weak effort.  To have a Hero get boosted by an objective would make part of his strength only effective in 1 or 2 quests.  I wouldn't be surprised if he simply became an Ally that you play from your hand however.

## 11 [gokubb on March 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606413)

I didn't mean an objective character, I meant a character good at questing.

Sorry about that!  I feel really dumb about misreading your post!

As I said above, I do not think such a deck would be decent (as much as I would love that), I think you can do better with NUMEROUS other combinations of heroes right now.

In response to someone's post about Elrohir being one of the most unimpressive heroes yet: yes. I felt like I couldn't even justify having him in a deck because A. Elladan isn't out yet, and B. Without Elladan, his ability becomes useless. A character who can defend multiple times with 1 defense is a dead character. I do feel like I might like trying him in a deck once Elladan comes out, but to this point he's spend his time in my box, not on the playing table.

## 15 [lleimmoen on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606775)

Yes, it was me. I was assuming Elladan will be as many have predicted (the attacking version). And I was finding him unimpressive even with the defense of 3. I hope time proves me wrong but I just cannot see that happening unless Elladan is something really different than predicted.

its annoying me as i cant afford rivendell yet, so i have a pretty much useless hero for the foreseeable future.....argh

## 17 [Sprenger on March 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606861)

Im hoping for another hobbit. I'd love to see Merry or Pippin. But you are probably right about the brothers going back to back.

I'm not seeing much room for yet another Leadership 10-cost hero, period, not even with his brother showing up. I already have five decks and Imrahil collecting dust.

That's similar to what I was saying, Elrohir is very unimpressive (not only to me), except it is Aragorn who cannot find a place in my five deck, Imrahil is getting spotlight on the other hand.

## 20 [Dam the Man on March 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61906-new-hero/?do=findComment&comment=606908)

I'm running Aragorn with Theodred and splashing with Spirit from Celebrian's Stone (even before the Spirit song came out).

Yeah, I'd been playing this one for a long time, right from the start and then in and out again. Currently though other Leadership heroes fit better for me: Théodred makes money instead of giving it away (as I usually need not to block that much with the deck), Dain and Gloin are obvious in the two Dwarven decks I run and Imrahil seems far superior to Aragorn in coop as he readies with ease and even during the combat.

But the Stone synergy is always tempting, I see.
