# [Fog On Barrow Downs Card Count Please](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179895-fog-on-barrow-downs-card-count-please/)

## 1 [alexbobspoons on June 10, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179895-fog-on-barrow-downs-card-count-please/?do=findComment&comment=1654916)

So my fog on barrow downs has arrived, and curiously it has four copies of the quest card 4, all seem identical.

 

So I was worried I may have other cards missing as a result?

 

I seem to have:

 

40 straight encounter cards

1 objective ally (bombadil)

1 boon

1 campaign card

1 back card and 1 front card

2 rules cards

7 quest cards (albeit 4 copies of card-4)

 

Is it just a bonus card mistake or is something missing?

 

Also, bearing in mind I have bounght the entire back catalogue over the past 4 months, but havent counted decks, should I be worried that card inclusion mistakes happen? Should I be counting all my decks to make sure I am not missing anything?

Or is this something specific to POD decks maybe as they are not celophane sealed?

 

Thanks for any help

 

Alex

I haven't got this quest, but it does sound like a mistake unless they are four different Stage 4 that look alike but have different effects (? It's better if someone who has played the quest can confirm. 

 

But I'm quite curious about where you got it - you're in the UK, right? I've seen it in the FFG online store but I can't quite stomach the shipping over the Atlantic doubling the price when I could almost get a deluxe expansion for the same amount. But I would love to own and play Barrow-Downs. It's one of my favourite parts of the book.

Let me point you to a wonderful resource: http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search]

 

in the parentheses after cardname and collection number you will find how many of the given  card are included in the package (x4)

 

http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Trapped-Inside-a-Barrow-FotBD [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Trapped-Inside-a-Barrow-FotBD]

 

in the parentheses you will find a (x4) which means it is standardly included in the packege 4 times. I believe the 4 indicates that up to the 4 players, everyone will have its own quest, and probably make its own progress even if the questcards are the same.

Yeah, there are four copies of that quest card because the players can get split up, so it's theoretically possible for all four players to each end up on their own separate stage 4.

It's supposed to have 4 of the same quest card, because each person can be split into their own staging area.

 

I've never seen a packaging mistake where there were missing or extra cards.  But I also haven't gone through and checked to make sure every encounter card was present.

Speaking of, how is the splitting up supposed to work? My friends and I thought that Standing Stones just referred to the first player at the time it goes into play and were expecting some way for it to return and send someone else to Stage 4 but it doesn't seem to work that way. So does everyone go into their own staging area when stage 3 happens?

People go to their own staging area whenever a Great Barrow gets added.  Standing Stones just makes you add a Great Barrow when you travel.

Im afraid i got it direct from ffg and paid the high shipping, then got hit for customs including royal mails £8 handling charge.

I got 3NM packs at same time, but this did work out very expensive to be honest.

Some members (or was it just one?) didn't get Khamul in their Black Riders Nightmare Decks for some reason.

When else would a great barrow get added?

They get shuffled into the deck and can be revealed during staging.

I see, we must have just skimmed Stage 3A when we played and missed the last line.

Playing with only one Great Barrow (the one you add to staging when you travel to standing stones) and not shuffling the other 4 into the encounter deck VASTLY changes this quest and completely neuters it. 

 

The hardest and most nailbiting part of this quest is deciding when to travel to standing stones and allowing the first player to get trapped in a copy of Stage 4 because the faster you go the less chance there is of a second Great Barrow appearing taking yet another player away from the group right before victory but you also need to be ready to quickly escape from Stage 4B as well so can't rush in before you are ready either.
You really need to be quick at the end of the quest as even a second copy of Great Barrow can really ruin your day. I personally have beaten only a few games in which I had to escape a second Great Barrow and the couple of times I've had a third appear I end up threating out or conceding (any locations revealed whilst in a great barrow increases threat and if you run decks that rely on each other and share duties between them having them split apart will quickly lead to a loss). 

Not including the 4 extra copies makes this quest a cake walk compared to what it is supposed to be.

You are meant to be dreading wights and barrows by the end and praying against another great barrow appearing before you make it to the finishing line.

Yeah - me and my brother have recently been playing a campaign on OCTGN, in which we beat every quest first try, except Fog on the Barrow Downs, which took 5 attempts. All because we kept getting stuck in barrows at inopportune moments.

Though the last time we did seem to have it very well sussed out and ended up exploring four of the five Great Barrows on our way to victory.
