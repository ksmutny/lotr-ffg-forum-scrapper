In the new saga expansion, theres a bow which makes ranged attack into staging attack.

My question is, if a ranged character use this bow to attack an enemy in the staging area, is this attack considered to be a ranged attack?

I think there was an official answer to this…. but I don't know where.   Normally an attack into the staging area is not considered ranged.  However, the text of Great Yew Bow specifies that the attack you make is a ranged attack.  So, in that case, the attack is ranged.  

In other words, attacks into the staging area are not ranged unless some card text designates them as such.

So, if my understanding is correct, Legolas can have a Great Yew Bow and a Silvan Bow attached, attack into the staging area, and actually receive the +1 for having participated in a "range" attack?

correct. the Great Yew Bow explicitly states it's a "ranged" attack.

That's why Bard's ability works with the Great Yew Bow (as mentioned in the announcement article), also.
