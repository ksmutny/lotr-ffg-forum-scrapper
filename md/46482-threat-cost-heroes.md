Anyone noticed that all the heroes in the core set have a threat level equal to the sum of their stats? (Willpower + Attack + Defense + Hitpoints) So that should indicate that the designers thinks all special powers on the heroes are equally strong. However I find it strange that Bilbo Baggins threat is 9, though his stats should indicate 6. Anyone thoughts why?

im not sure, i was surprised that bilbo didnt have higher stats, though i suppose in the hobbit he's not a very adventuring sort of guy, mind you i think that after a few games ill start to appreciate the draw an extra card ability

I would have thought Bilbo would have a higher Willpower stat at least - after all he did mostly resist the corrupting influence of the Ring for many, many years.

Hobbits are the greatest threat Middle-Earth ever spawned, naturally Bilbo has a higher threat than his stats would indicate demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] !
