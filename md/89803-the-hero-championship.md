Sorry about the question but...can we vote on that page or the votes will be hosted here?

 

If the former, how can I vote after registering?

No problem! The votes will be hosted here. I thought it would be cool if everyone could see what each other thought. The link is just a clearer view of the bracket with no real functionality.

Well you have to seed a bracket somehow. The higher seeds got byes. The seeds are definietely subjective, but I tried to do it according to what I have seen in posted decks and some of the favorite/worst hero threads.

## 9 [Jekzer on September 5, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=857885)

A - Eleanor - close call too, I love both, but I fell in love before with my treachery-eraser cheek


B - Mirlonde - she's one of those heroes that I think that shines more than most people think


C - Pippin (Lo) - clear choice for me!


D - Bilbo Baggins - every time I see his illustration, I can't help but smile. Besides he's of tremendous help in solo!


E - Faramir - one of my favorite heroes!


F - Glóin - I used him so many times at the beginning...


G - Háma - Never used him (I am more Leadership/Spirit/Lore player) but he's a really cool one. Besides, Magali...


H - Nori - Nice for alternate dwarf decks (not the classic Thorin & Co. one). And is like Bilbo  when looking at the illustration, smile!


I - Bifur - Well as you can see I am a dwarf lover...


J - Denethor - ...but in this case, I prefer the Steward of Gondor!


K - Hirluin - Love the art, and how he changed Outlands (well, him and the entire player card pool from SF)


L - Frodo - Easy call here, even with Magali on the other side!


M - Théodred - That's the other hero that I used a lot the early days!


N - Merry - Really, really nice card


 


Well I am a dwarf and hobbit lover as you can see. And of course, Magali illustrations are top notch! But I tried to choose not only by art, but by usefulness and theme. Well sometimes by fond memories ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png].

## 11 [Ellareth on September 5, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=857960)

A - Beravor / Eleanor is one of must hero in multiplayer, but I often play solo gamse and card draw is very good in th game.

B - Thalin / Mirlonde may be better than what meets the eyes, but Thalin is still better in my opinion.

C - Pippin / Card draw is backbone of any deck types, and I feel like Pippin will be that draw engine for Hobbit decks.... and also the fact I don't play multiplayer that much goes against Brand.

D - Bilbo Baggins / Bilbo is yet another draw engine. Also having 1 copy of Core Set tips the favour for Hobbit heroes because of Fast Hitches.

E - Faramir / I'm not a big fan of Lore Faramir; high threat, inefficient stat distribution... but still much better tha Spirit Pippin in my opinion.
F - Gloin / Elrohir comsumes resources, Gloin makes resources.
G - Hama / This comparison doesn't even seem fair. One of most powerful tactics hero (in my view) v.s. Dwarf hero that gets shadowed by better Dwarf heroes.
H - Nori / Poor Dwalin.. he doesn't stand a chance when being compared to Nori.
I - Bifur / Once again, resource consumer v.s. resource generator (technically resource transfer).
J - Denethor / I personally don't use Denethor often anymore, but I'd definitely still choose Denethor over Oin.

K - Hirluin the Fair / Hirluin has low threat and can glue a deck together, Glorfindel has high threat and does not glue a deck together.

L - Frodo Baggins / Arguably one of best hero v.s. arguably one of worst hero. I will keep the benefit of keeping a hero alive in exchange for threat gain rather than penalty of losing a hero for 2 Stand and Fight.

M - Theodred / Reliable way of generating resource from turn 1.

N - Merry / Merry not only compensates low attack strength of Hobbits, but also can be quite broken when combined with Brand.

All I added a running vote tally. Thanks to all the voters. Loved Ellareth and Jekzer's rationale. Khamul made some nice predictions and made interesting dark horse choices with Caldara and Fatty.

 

Some of the races are still pretty even, though we only have six votes so far.

A - Eleanor - Hard decision since they're both useful non-canon heroes. Went with Eleanor cause I like her art a bit more

B - Mirlonde - While i love Thalin's ability, I've been using and liking Mirlonde a lot this cycle especially with all the recent lore love in player cards

C - Pippin - Just not a fan of Brand, maybe its the multiplayer only ability, maybe its the art. Plus the new Pippin is really just awesome in both the aspects i dislike in Brand

D - Prince Imrahil - Strong often overshadowed character whos ability will always be useful. Not the biggest fan of Bilbo tho he does have his uses.

E - Faramir - Faramir is one of my faves and spirit pippin blows. Easiest decision i've made yet.

F - Elrohir - Also a big fan of the elf brothers. Gloin seems to have dipped into obsoleteness now anyway

G - Hama - Cool art and an amazing ability. Hama is just good stuff

H - Nori - More consistent threat reduction and he's holding a beer! whats not to like?

I - Elladan - Like i already said, I'm a fan of the elf brothers. Do like Bifur's art tho

J - Denethor - Love Denethor's scrying ability and he still holds up quite well defensively too. Oin is the definition of meh

K - Hirluin - Cool art and the lynchpin of one of the more powerful deck archetypes. Gets my vote

L - Frodo - Suberb ability on the ring bearer plus Caldara blows.

M - Theodred - They'll always be a place for low threat resource generation IMO

N - Merry - Good ability and the low threat cost is just what tactics has been begging for. Fatty is also kind of meh

Count updated. Match up spotlight:

 

Prince Imrahil has made a recent comeback going from a 3-5 disadvantage to taking a razor thin 6-5 lead over Bilbo.

 

A direct quote from Prince Imrahil after the first period: "I hope people are voting for me. I mean for 2 extra threat, you get 5 extra stat points!"

 

Bilbo Baggins responded, "Prince who? Oh... that's right... I am Bilbo freaking Baggins!"

Great idea!  Here are my votes:

A – Eleanor: a hard choice between two heroes I like, but having treachery cancellation on standby is a life-saver.  The better you know the encounter deck, the better Eleanor becomes.

B – Thalin: it feels great when one hitpoint enemies become blank encounter cards

C – Pippin (Lo): poor Brand. I dont even own Black Riders yet, but Lore Pippin looks better

D – Imrahil: another vote for Imrahil. Solid hero and fun thematically as he rushes to the rescue when someone falls

E – Faramir: I think Spirit Pippin has a lot more going on for him than people give him credit for, but Faramir is one of my favorie characters in the book and has an ability you can build a deck around

F – Gloin: I like the Elladan and Elrohir pairing, but wanted to throw some more love Gloin's way. He can still be a fun and useful hero in certain decks.

G – Hama: You can build entire decks around Hama's ability, which you can't say about a lot of heroes

H – Nori: Consitent threat lowering that is still good even with the errata.

I – Bifur: Lots of love for a low-threat Lore hero that can help with the resource smoothing in mutli-sphere decks, or even give a lore deck resource acceleration in a multi-player game.

J – Denethor: one of the best heros in a solo game, still solid in multi-player. 

K –Glorfindel (Lo): underrated as a hero because of his spirit version and because Lore has better options for high-threat heroes.  Still, his ability is useful, he's the same sphere as his mount, and his stats are solid.

L - Frodo:  I'm a little surpised that Frodo is seeded this low.  His ability is excellent, it fits great within his sphere, and it can bail the player/s out of bad situations.

M - Theodred: low threat and conistent resource acceleration.  He makes it into a lot of my decks.

N – Merry: don't have Black Riders yet, but I'm excited to try him in hobbit decks and in mono-Tactics decks with Theoden.

A - Beravor (easy choice at least for me. If I play spirit I use a test of will/dwarven tomb all the time (so eleanor would be redundant, and if I don't...well I don't)

 

B - Mirlonde (I love thalin (favourite dwarf art by the way) but having tried a monolore deck with mirlonde I have to say she's stronger)

 

C - Pippin (lore) (seems awsome, can't wait for TBR, never used brand)

 

D - Prince Imrahil (I like Imrahil. If bilbo had 6 or 8 threat I might like him more...but with 9 threat he's a bit off my schemes)

 

E - Faramir (well he the choice is obvious since the other challenger is spirit pippin)

 

F - Elrohir (one of my favourite heroes)

 

G - Hama (one of my absolute favourite hero together with legolas)

 

H - Dwalin (really like him, I prefer reducing my threat by combat then by companionship...I know his ability is wasted in some scenarios and I know nori's stronger...but I still like dwalin better)

 

I - Elladan (one of my favourite heroes)

 

J - Denethor (well denethor's good, awsome in a monolore encounter control deck while oin is one of the worst in my opinion)

 

K - Hirluin the Fair (I like glorfindel as a lore hero, but I find his ability a bit lacking)

 

L - Frodo (frodo's great...caldara's....well...let's not say it...)

 

M - Theodred (one of my absolute favourite heroes)

 

N - Merry (seems great, really looking forward to try him)

Thanks for voting and special thanks to Pharmsboy, Glowwyrm and Devastazione for their commentaries.

 

The count has been updated.

 

Update: Since Prince Imrahil recently took the lead, he has been putting the hurt on Bilbo. I guess people put more stock in stats/mechanics than nostalgia. Sorry, Bilbo!

 

Match-up Spotlight: DWARVES vs ELVES!!!!

 

B – Thalin - 9 / Mirlonde - 11

F – Elrohir - 13 / Gloin - 7

I – Elladan - 10 / Bifur - 10

 

We have 3 dwarf vs elf match-ups and they are some of the closer match-ups. Though, Elrohir has slightly pulled away from Gloin, the other two match-ups are turning out to be nail-biters! Let's go down to the field where Thalin is facing Mirlonde.

 

As Thalin addresses the media during a timeout, they notice the blood in his beard. "I call on the Gonnhirrim and those loyal to us to support Gloin, Bifur and myself. Let it not be heard that a descendant from Erebor fell to an elf."

 

Note: Gloin and Bifur were not available for comment. It seems they are trying to distance themselves from the FFG-created hero. Who knew they were Tolkien snobs?

 

Mirlonde said, "I understand that a lot of people did not like me when I first came on the scene. However, as people got to know me, we have started to develop a better relationship.Goes to show you can't base everything on first impressions."

Updated count. Thanks for voting and a special shout out to Rainelotr for his musings!

 

Match-up update: Mirlonde and Thalin are now all tied up 11-11. Thalin is really feeling the pressure, but Mirlonde is playing it cool. "When slaying orcs or waiting out forum polls becomes too intense, I like to just take a second and do something peaceful, such as watch waves crash onto the rocks. Me-time is very important to me," said Mirlonde in a recent interview. We will have to keep an eye on this match-up even if Mirlonde doesn't.

 

Match-up Spotlight: Who is the fairest of them all?

 

Hirluin the Fair and Glorfindel (Lore) are in a dead heat. The score is 11-11 and with less than 24 hours to go, this match can easily go either way. Grumblings from Rivendell have emerged as one of their Noldor champions may lose to an upstart from the Outlands. However, many herdsmen and knights and swordsmen and hunters and warriors and ... Forlongs?... have come to the support of Hirluin. Both contestants took time from striking dramatic poses and brushing their long blond hair to share some short anecdotes.

 

Glorfindel (L) comments, "I get no respect. I used to be great, top of my game really. The other heroes always wanted me on the adventure. Then some dwarf wanted to try and retake Moria and then he came along. You know who I'm talking about. Now, I'm not bitter, but I am just as much of an iconic character as he is. Sure his art is a little more ... epic and someone forgot to add his willpower, attack and defense to his threat cost, but I am still very useful in a number of situations. I mean the other hero is more like a misprint. Who wants an aberration for a hero? Come on... really?!!" 

 

When asked why the forum should vote him through to the next round, Hirluin responded, "I'm Hirluin... THE FAIR. I have nothing more to say on the subject."

 

Well, there is a less than a day until the first tier ends. So cast you deciding votes on who should be crowned the fairest of them all!

A - Beravor - (so versatile)

B - Thalin - (tough call, as M really IS better than given credit for.  In the end, all my early battles with Thalin by my side carried the "nostalgia" vote for me)

C - Pippin - (You could have put a hero version of Barliman Butterman up against Brand... and Brand would still lose).

D - Imrahil - (better versatility for single or mulit-player, although I do love Bilbo for solo... can't get past that horrible art-work)

E - Faramir - (2nd-favorite ME character.  As far as I'm concerned, since Turin won't be in this game for the forseeable future, you can crown Faramir as champion now).

F - Gloin - (Have never found much use for the Twins, and this is one of my favorite art-works in the game to date)

G - Hama - (Perhaps Bombur vs Brand would've been an appropriate match-up to make them somewhat interesting???)

H - Nori - (Dwalin couldn't get my nostalgia vote this time... the lack of consistent orc enemies lately make him nearly unusable)

I - Bifur - (Still the best way to get those resources for spendy Lore)

J - Denethor - (one of the better "themed" heroes)

K - Glorfindel - (based solely on my hopes for an all-Glorfindel championship... lol)

L - Frodo - (The "Tank" versus the newbie... no contest)

M - Theodred - (Mr. Moneybags... All.  Day.  Long).

N - Merry - (An all-Hobbit fight hardly seems fair when they aren't even in the game yet!)

The count has been updated. Thanks for voting and a shout out to benhanses for his commentary.

Matchup update: 30 minutes to go until the end of tier one and Hirluin and Glorfindel are all tied up. Vote now to break the tie!!!

Match-up spotlight: The Ranger vs The Fool

Faramir is pitching the only shutout of the contest. Pippin (S) has not garnered a single vote and the chances of him getting a vote before the end are not looking good. Pippin (S) was so melancholy due to the results that he refused to meet with the media. We, therefore, turned to his best friend, Merry.

Merry, "I said to him, 'Pip, it's alright. We still have the Shire.' But that didn't seem to help. That used to be so comforting to him. I told him this would happen if he insisted on associating with only hobbits. Well, if the friendship with Pippin (Spirit) doesn't work out, Pippin (Lore) seems like a pretty cool guy and more open-minded when it come to inter-racial adventuring."

Faramir also added, "I did not even know about this match-up till five minutes ago. I thought I had a bye. My condolences to Pippin (Spirit). Seems like a great guy, but a ranger's got to do what a ranger's got to do. My eyes are on the prize."

Tier 1 is coming to a close! However, Hirluin and Glorfindel are all tied up.

 

Therefore, this leads to a tiebreaker! The next vote for Hirluin or Glorfindel will decide the match. Good luck, heroes!!

O - Glorfindel - I have to be realistic, as much as I like Beravor the spirit version of Glorfindel is too good to lose this match...he's in 2 of my 3 or 4 best solo deck.

 

P - Ori - I hope we'll get another version of Gimli in the second box of the fellowship saga because this one was a bit off my taste. Nice stats and all but unless he's your only tactics hero his ability's pretty redundant (and my only tactics hero is generally Legolas...or Beregond...or Hama....well not Gimli).

 

Q - Thalin - as I said before he's my favourite dwarf (artwise), and his ability's awsome...paired with Dain he rocks. Really sorry for Strider who's one of the best lore heroes and has lots of decks built around him but I really dig Thalin.

 

R - Boromir - another tough one...I think Pippin's gonna be a blast (with his hobbit friends a nuclear blast), but Boromir's Boromir...if only his art was that of the leadership version he'd make top 3 in my best hero chart...really awsome

 

S - Aragorn - you need a few cards to make him really, really good, but with only steward of gondor he shines already...Imrahil's good and I like both his card and the character (by the way the card is very thematic) but King Elessar wins

 

T - Faramir - haven't even tried him yet but I know I'm gonna enjoy playing him...love ranged, rangers and Faramir himself

 

U - Legolas - Sorry that I had to choose between two of my 4 or 5 absolute favourite heroes...I choose Legolas though...he's my number 1 anyway

 

V - Hama - we'll he's my number 2

 

W - Dain - need I say more ?

 

X - Sam - Arguably the best leadership hero in the game...and he's not out yet (not for me anyway), plus he's one of my favourite characters in tolkien lore

 

Y - Bifur - not that I like Bifur that much but I still haven't found a good use for this version of Boromir

 

Z - Thorin Oakenshield - this is the toughest choice...both are good and I really like them...I choose Thorin only because I like him better in tolkien lore.

 

AA - Elrond - Again...need I say more ?

 

AB - Bard the Bowman - He's unplayable in solo play...and I know it...and I was really disappointed because he's one of my favourite characters in tolkien lore (favourite from the hobbit)...but well...I'm still gonna vote for him because he's Bard the Bowman, slayer of Smaug...and because in multi he's pretty good.

 

AC - Beregond - Another really tough one...both are awsome heroes, and I use both of them a lot (theodred has been in my decks since the beginning and I don't think he's ever going to leave) but Beregond has a place in my heart from the books. Plus he's a pretty amazing hero himself...I love playing him in multiplayer with my courage and defense deck (Beregond+Gondorian Shield+Spear of the Citadel+Goblin Cleaver+Swift Strike+Behind strong Walls....+Stand together with Gondorian Spearman+Spear of the Citadel) ok I'll stop...it's so much fun though XD...

 

AD - Merry - I never tried Balin yet, I don't like when you have to change something bad for something unknown (potentially worse) plus merry is a real beast (in a hobbit deck he rocks, in a monotactics deck with theoden he over-rocks)

 

 

well my love for tactics is pretty explicit...7 tactics heroes, 4 lore, 4 leadership and 1 spirit...(well my not-so-much-love for spirit heroes as well)...

I cannot believe some of the turn ups.
Did not expect any of Noldor Elves to win, but 2 of them survived!

 

Here are my votes for round of 16:

 

O. Glorfindel(s) - Beravor is good, but Spirifindel is broken.
P. Ori - Ori's draw power is just so good, and his stats are competetive as well.
Q. Aragorn(Lo) - As much as I think Thalin is must have in 3~4 player games, Loragorn's ability is too good.
R. Pippin(Lo) - Despite the fact Boromir is one of my favourite characters and I've never even played with Lore Pippin yet, I just prefer drawing over combat prowness.
S. Imrahil - I find Imrahil's ability to be more versatile than Aragorn's
T. Beorn - Beorn has proven himself again and again that he is a beast. Faramir has his uses but they are limited.
U. Legolas - Legolas is to this day one of solid go to tactics hero.
V. Hama - If we were back in Mirkwood Cycle I might have picked Eowyn. But Eowyn's Will Power is replacable while Hama's thicket of shinanigan is not.
W. Dain Ironfoot - Nori is a good dwarf, but Dain is broken.
X. Sam Gamgee - To be honest I'm surprised Theoden is in round of 36 by default. Better heroes than him have lost in the prelimenary.
Y. Boromir(Le) - I feel like Bifur is the better hero in isolated situation, but chose Boromir because Bifur is shadowed by Ori whereas Leadermir remains to be only Gondor synerging hero.
Z. Denethor - Likewise, Thorin is probably better hero in isolation, but he is outshadowed by Dain while Denethor is the only encounter deck manipulating hero.
AA. Elrond - Time for you to rest in peace Lore Glorfindel. Cannot believe you made it thsi far.
AB. Frodo Baggins - Bard is good hero in multiplayer, but Frodo is great hero in any sized game.
AC. Theodred - Theodred's resource generation is not to be trifled with.
AD. Merry - Balin is good, but Merry is the only tactics Hobbit hero.

O- Glorfindel - I SO badly would like to pick Beravor instead, but if I'm going truthfully, I have to pick Spirfindel. My condolences to Beravor.

P- Gimli - I'm gonna go with the classic core hero on this one, although I really do love Ori. But I feel that Gimli is much more versatile, mainly because his ability isn't triggered by dwarves. It's just through pure damage.

Q- Aragorn (Lore)- Thalin had my vote against Mirlonde, but I'm gonna have to go with Aragorn. Strider is too much for Thalin to handle, unfortunately.

R- Boromir (Tactics)- I think this one may be a little unfair on my part, as I haven't been able to try Pippin out yet. But based on my initial thoughts of him, I'm going to have to choose Boromir. A very useful hero, and I love tactics!

S- Prince Imrahil - A big portion of this vote goes to the fact that Imrahil has the Gondor trait and Aragorn doesn't. Yes, you could Steward of Gondor him, but it's so much easier to have an already-Gondor hero for a Gondor deck. 

T- Faramir - These two are polar opposites. One is very straightforward, and the other takes some time to make use of. But I'm gonna have to go with the latter, since he's the star of trap decks, which I love SO much.

U- Legolas - Definitely have to go with Legolas for this one. I think his ability is very useful, especially in a mono-tactics deck, and he doesn't require a counterpart to use. Sorry twins!

V- Eowyn - Out of the two Rohan heroes competing in this bracket, I'm going to have to pick Eowyn because of her astounding Willpower. Hama is useful on some occasions, but not enough to beat Eowyn.

W- Dain Ironfoot - Sorry Nori, but this one is pretty easy to decide on.

X- Theoden - Sorry, but my passion for mono-tactics is going to beat the dedicated hobbit. Hoping that Theoden won't let me down on his premiere!! 

Y- Boromir (Leadership)- I love a good Gondor deck, and I rarely use Bifur even in dwarf decks, since I usually prefer his ally version. 

Z- Thorin Oakenshield - This was definitely a tough choice. But since I usually play two-handed, if I ever use Denethor, his ability is never used.

AA- Elrond - Sorry Glorfindel, but it appears that this one might be unanimous. At least be proud you made it this far.

AB- Bard the Bowman - Definitely one of my favorite tactics heroes, and I never use Frodo's ability for some reason. Go Tactics!

AC- Beregond - Sorry Theodred. You may be able to defeat poor Dunhere, but I'm afraid you don't really stand a chance against this Gondor behemoth of a defender.

AD- Merry - Another one I had to contemplate on... I do love Balin's ability, but I think I'm going to like this little hobbit more.

 

Well, I think I voted for every Tactics hero on the list (except Beorn)! Great job on this Samwise, it is really a great idea.

Thanks to all that voted. The count has been updated. Special thanks to legolas18, Ellareth and DevastazioneH88 for some great commentary.

 

Match-up spotlight!

 

THE BOWMAN VS THE RING-BEARER

 

Frodo Baggins handily dispatched the Gondorian maiden, Caldara, but he now faces steep competition in Bard the Bowman.   Of the original 7 hobbit competitors, only Sam, Merry, Pippin (Lore) and Frodo remain. During the previous round, Merry committed fratricide in offing fellow hobbit, Fatty, Bilbo was sent back to the Shire by Prince Imrahil, and Pippin (S) was absolutely spanked by Faramir. Though we are in the early stages of the game, Bard is leading Frodo 4-3. Currently, Frodo and Pippin are fairing the worst of the hobbits still in the competition.

 

Asked concerning his match-up with the diminutive hobbit, Bard said, "I knew Frodo's uncle even though I never met Frodo himself. The fight almost does not seem fair after slaying a dragon, but, alas, I want to reach the next round. Plus, I'd also like to say my art rules. I mean I should win based on that merit alone."

 

Frodo also seemed confident. "It's still early in the match and I'm confident I'll pull through," said Frodo. "Plus what's slaying a dragon compared with saving all of Middle Earth? Great props to Bard for the whole Smaug-slaying thing, but it's not even a comparison. Also, has everyone forgotten about my sweet defense mechanism?"

O: Glorfindel - Too strong for Beravor, although he's definitely not my favorite

P: Gimli - Giving a purpose to citadel plate since 2011

Q: Thalin - I love direct damage decks

R: Pippin - I hate the art on Boromir(T) and I've been looking forward to hobbits since I first played the game

S: Aragorn - Practically the same as Imrahil, but cooler and access to Aragorn-specific items

T: Faramir - I loved playing Beorn in the Hobbit quests, but I love lore, Gondor, and rangers even more

U: Legolas - Elrohir is top 15 for me, but Legolas is top 5

V: Eowyn - Hama is nice but there are a lot of good tactics heroes.  Eowyn is sorely needed in the spirit sphere

W: Nori - I refuse to play Dain because he's OP.  Nori is one of my favorite Dwarves, too.

X: Sam - Looking forward to the hobbits and he's the best one.  I also like Theoden and think he gets picked on too much

Y: Boromir - Art is great, although his ability is mostly worthless right now

Z: Denethor - Still a good defender (esp. with burning brand and gondorian shield) and his ability works nicely when you don't have to defend

AA: Elrond - I might love his healing bonus even more than Vilya.

AB: Bard - tough call, but I don't actually own Frodo because CatC was out of print when I started playing

AC: Beregond - A staple in every tactics deck.  Great art, too

AD: Merry - A tactics Hobbit?!?  Sign me up!

O - Glorfindel-Don't get me wrong, I like Beravor, but Glorfindel is just too good. He really opens up a lot of deckbuilding possibilities.

P - Gimli-My favorite combo from the Core Set days is Citadel Plate+Gimli.

Q - Aragorn-My favorite hero in the game, with what I think is the best ability. He allows you to abuse some of the most powerful cards in the game like OHaUH Gandalf and Frodo.

R - Boromir (T)

S - Prince Imrahil-Practically identical heroes. This is just a matter of preference for me.

T - Faramir-Maybe it is the new car smell to Faramir, but Beorn to me needs expensive cards to make him shine, and any deck that I run right now that has Lore includes Ranger Spikes.

U - Legolas-Best Tactics hero in the game.

V - Eowyn-I really liked Hama when he came out, but I find that he has fallen to the wayside in favor of other Tactics heroes.

W - Dain Ironfoot-No contest.

X - Sam Gamgee-Poor Théoden. He got crapped on by the design team. Hopefully we will see a new version of him in one of The Two Towers Saga Expansion.

Y - Bifur-I find him the glue to my Dwarf decks.

Z - Thorin Oakenshield-A nice ability and his stats are pretty ridiculous.

AA - Elrond-Again, no contest.

AB - Frodo Baggins-This is a tough one, but Frodo's ability is better in my opinion, especially with the myriad ways we can reduce threat in the game now.

AC -Theodred-Another glue hero in my decks. I also tend to use a lot of chump blockers than one uber-defender.

AD - Balin-Nice ability and low threat for a Leadership hero.

O - Glorfindel - He's just too good.  One of the best art depictions in the game, the best starting threat, fantastic stats, great support cards.  He's gotta be the favorite to win this whole thing.  And as for Beravor... I didnt vote for her in round 1...so...

 

P - Gimli - Really tough decision.  Gimli won the mental battle for still being a sturdy beast and the fond memories of crushing the stronger enemies of the core set with the proud elf equipped with a citadel plate and possibly a dwarven axe.

 

Q - Aragorn (lore) - One of the best arts, one of the best abilities, for one of the best characters.  I expect lore Aragorn to make it deep in this tourney, sorry Thalin but your fictitious existence cant compare to the king. 

 

R - Pippin (lore) - Tactics Boromir is an absolute beast no doubt about it, but his downfall for my vote is the fact that he looks cross-eyed in the picture.  Yes, that is my reasoning... may the hobbit advance

 

S - Aragorn (leadership) - Even though I really like the prince, it is just so much fun to deck out leadership Aragorn with all his toys and attachments.  His ability gives him so much versatility and its not hard to offset the cost.  One of the originals and still one of the best.

 

T - Faramir - Another tough decision but I had to go with prob my favorite character.  Love the art on both cards tho

 

U - Legolas - I just dont think Elrohir has the mental fortitude to continue this tournament with his brother left behind in the previous round.  His heart just isnt in it.  I expect Legolas to progress through this round just as easy as he progress through locations during the combat phase.

 

V - Hama - Very challenging decision between the two Rohan heroes, but Eowyn is a bit one dimensional for my tastes.  Hama has so many cool things he can pull off and it seems like every set or two theres a new combo around him that can make for some fun decks.

 

W - Nori - Nothing against Dain, all things considered he's probably the most powerful hero in this list...I'm just bored with him.  And Nori still has that beer... 

 

X - Sam -  Theoden's superb art cant save him from his own mediocre ability.  Sam takes the cake on this one, and odds are, he loves cake.

 

Y - Boromir (leadership) - Comes down to one thing. The art.  Boom.

 

Z - Denethor - Probably my hardest decision of this round.  I really like Thorin not only as a player card but as a character but it wasnt enough to make me not vote for the versatile steward that is Denethor.  That scheming noble just gives me so many playing options for me not to vote for him

 

AA - Elrond - How did lore glorfindel even make it to this round?? The cinderalla story stops here.  Elrond is a boss, absolutely everything about is character and especially the card just screams power.  Love it.

 

AB - Bard the Bowman - While i think Frodo is a much better hero, I just really like Bard as character.  Seems like a genuine bad@ss.  Thats worth a vote i think

 

AC - Beregond - While Theodred is universally helpful, he is almost always replaceable as well.  Beregond is just an absolute stud.  Reminds me of wolverine...He's the best there is at what he does. #defense 

 

AD - Balin - Made my case in hall of beorn's competition for why Balin is undervalued.  The dwarf is always a solid option and I think he can stave off this quirky upstart from the shire.

Ok, I will step in for this round. Judging by design (including art), not power.

 

O. Glorfindel.

P. Ori. I am surprised he seems to be so far behind.

Q. Aragorn.

R. Boromir. I like Lore Pippin, perhaps the most of the Hobbits out there, but still, it is hard to vote against Boromir (though the art is really holding this one back).

S. Imrahil. A little cooler.

T. Beorn. This is another tough one, my favourites often packed together. I will surely play with Faramir more, but I just like Beorn better.

U. Legolas. Couldn't get into the twins, Elrohir was the cooler of them, in every way, but I still go with the Silvan (though he probably wasn't).

V. Háma. Nice art.

W. Nori. This got me into it, I really want Dáin to lose this one, even before he finally gets his errata, one of the worst designs out there.

X. Théoden. A tough one again.

Y. Boromir. A very easy one.

Z. Denethor.

AA. Glorfindel. So that he has a vote.

AB. Bard the Bowman.

AC. Théodred. Close for me, but not for others, apparently.

AD. Merry. May one Hobbit prevail. But this just shows how can even a game change perception of your beloved characters. Judged by the book experience, Balin would have easily won this one. The card just doesn't seem to depict him very well, though it has a good use.

O - Glorfindel. So sorry beravor. You are no light weight but G.sp is a heavy weight champ

P - Gimli. Great matchup here but raw power wins over utility in this case

Q - Aragorn. Voted for Thalin in the first round but I fear my crow killing friend is simply overmatched

R - Boromir(T). A personal fav in every way but art. Art is good but not among the best this game has seen. Pippin is great but just can't stand up to that extreme versatility of tactics Boromir

S - Aragorn(le). Close but not that close

T - Faramir. Sorry Beorn. Love ya but Faramir deserves more

U - Legolas.

V - Hama - another tough one. Close match up I'm voting hama because TFW decks are probably my fav mono sphere decks

W - Dain. Another case of a good dwarf being outside his weight class

X - Sam. Now this one is tough! Really tough. Tactics is my fav sphere and leadership my least fav. I've seen some flak directed Theodens way and I really have no idea why. He is an absolutely incredible hero. But Sam is the best Hobbit in the game

Y - Bifur. Utility beats power in this case

Z - Denethor.

AA - Elrond - I was really pumped the glorfindel lore made it through the first round.

AB - Frodo. Still the 2nd best spirit hero

AC - Beregond. lego represents the range of tactics. Beregond represents the sentinel

AD - Merry. Sam may be the best hobbit but dang if Merry isn't a welcome addition to the tactics sphere

## 62 [Mr Coffee on September 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=860243)

O - Glorfindel (S) - (Reaaaally wanted to go Beravor here... but let's be honest:  It's Glorfindel's world.  We all just live in it.  For now, he's the "Chuck Norris" of LOTR LCG).

P - Gimli - (who doesn't love a short, furry Revenge Tank!)

Q - Aragorn (Lo) -  (So hard to vote against Thalin, but Strider.. er, Loragorn... is the character that first grabbed my attention as a young reader and got me hooked on all things Tolkien.  Speaking of...  Thalin.  Isn't.  Nuff said.)

R - Pippin (Lo) - (Gonna tab this as my big "upset" choice... started to vote "Kill-them-all" Boromir, but since his sacrifice came for the greater good of defending Pippin anyways, I'll yield to his sacrifice... Besides, I'm uber stoked for all these new Hobbits!  Out with the old, in with the new!)

S - Aragorn (Le) - (I wanna love Imrahil more than I do... but seriously, it's Aragorn.  Although Imrahil's artwork nearly earned an upset pick here for me)

T - Faramir - (chants:  Fara-Mir!  Fara-mir!  Fara-mir!   Fara-mir!  Fara-meeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!!)

U - Legolas - (Elf-on-Elf violence.  Not exactly the kin-slaying here, but still nothing anyone wants to see... Plus Legolas avenges Gloin's... my favorite hero art... loss to Elrohir)

V - Hama - (Now that I've long ago broken my "Eowyn-Habit", I can't go back to her now.  Too risky, now that I've been sober for the better part of a year)

W - Dain - (Nori's win over Dwalin in the first round was a nod to the better threat-reduction mechanic...  But all non-Gimli Dwarves must bow before the uber-king!)

X - Sam Gamgee - (Like Caleb Grace reiterating Tolkien's thoughts:  You begin to realize that the main hero of the story gradually shifts from being Frodo... to being Sam.)

Y - Boromir (Le) - (Hardest vote for me in this round.  Bifur really should have earned my nostalgia vote, since I probably ran him 40% of all my games early on.  But a "double-Boromir-upset" in round two??  Too much to ask for!)

Z - Denethor - (gave Denethor my "superior theme" nod for round one. Thorin gets the nod over him this round for the same reason.)

AA - Glorfindel - (Glorfindel gets my "blindly biased" vote this round for two reasons:  1)  I don't give a **** that Elrond is the better hero... I WANT AN ALL-GLORFINDEL FINAL; and 2) Never been a big Elrond.. the character... fan in the first place.  3)  Glorfindel spanked the Witch King... and Balrogs in his earlier incarnation- cue canon purist arguments now; and 4)  I'm apparently not good at math!)

AB - Bard the Bowman - (actually wanted to vote for Frodo as a 4th Hobbit to set up the possibility of an all-hobbit "Final Four", but since he and Merry are both in this bottom division together, it couldn't happen.  So this is where I'll give my "artwork" vote of the round to Bard. Seriously, Magili has me torn... Half the time I think the art is too "pretty", and even non-elves look like elves.  Then you have those cards that you just sit back and "****"... Bard is that moment for me.  He and Gloin are currently my favorite hero artworks.  Although the new hobbits may end up growing on me to pass them....)

AC - Theodred  - ("Make that money" over "Save that Money"... and I used Theodred so much early on in this game.... had to give him my nostalgia vote this round)

AD - Merry - (Another tough call, as Balin's ability is great.  But Merry's artwork is just fantastic!  And his readying ability for extra attacks???  Just sick!  I am SOOOO pumped to see the inevitable new Eowyn Tactics hero and how she and this Merry will produce amazing combos!)

## 63 [Samwise Gamgee on September 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=860246)

Count updated. Thanks for voting and special thanks to Ana, Pharmboys2013, hildargo, benhanses, Rainelotr and Teamjimby for the excellent commentary!

Match-up update: Frodo is still trailing Bard. Pippin and Merry are also trailing. Sam is the only hobbit in control of his match. But these things swing quickly.

Match-up spotlight:

DAVID VS GOLIATH... I mean... NORI VS THE KING

This match-up has turned out to be much closer than originally predicted. Dain is only leading Nori 9-6. Many fans are rooting for this Cinderella story! (Oops, two new posts while writing this, now 11-6!)

One of Nori's fans, Pharmsboy, said "Nothing against Dain, all things considered he's probably the most powerful hero in this list...I'm just bored with him. And Nori still has that beer..."

Also, some fans are less fans of Nori than unwilling to support Dain.

Ana said, "This got me into it, I really want Dáin to lose this one, even before he finally gets his errata, one of the worst designs out there."

Teamjimby is trying to strike a balance, "I refuse to play Dain because he's OP. Nori is one of my favorite Dwarves, too."

Nori was overwhelmed by the support. He added, "I was just happy to get past Dwalin and I thought it was the end of the mine... I mean line... when I was matched up with Dain. I'd like to point out that Dain was not one of the company that went back to the Lonely Mountain. And threat reduction... is... AWESOME! Anyways, after this is all over, no matter how it turns out, we should all go get a beer!"

Dain the King took time from his rule to say, "I don't know why there are so many... "haters" I believe is the term? Yes, haters. As king, I have a great responsibility to support all Dwarrows. You all may be critical of me now that we are living in relative peace, but when a real hard quest comes along, you will all turn to your king!"

The second tier is now complete!!! We are now down to the Sweet Sixteen! This is where tough decision are made.

 

Let's look at some of the upsets from the last round. 

 

Merry squeaked by Balin with a score of 11-9. Merry's response," Whew! I thought that dwarf was going to eat me!"

 

The two rulers, Denethor and Thorin Oakenshield, had a closer battle than was initially reported. In the end, Denethor pulled out the upset and moves on to the next round with a score of 12-8. Denethor responded, "The race of men will always prevail." *Cherry tomato pop*

 

Gimili was to get the upper hand on Ori with a score of 13-7, while Samwise the Brave snuck past Theoden King with a score of 14-6.

 

The only dwarves who advanced to the sweet sixteen were Dain Ironfoot and Gimli. They were both facing off against dwarves. All other dwarves fell to there non-dwarf opponents.

 

Merry and Sam were the only hobbits to advance. Biblo, Frodo, Fatty and both Pippins will have to cheer them on from the sidelines.

 

Finally, what proved to be the biggest upset, Faramir slew Beorn in an epic contest. As Beorn let out one last blood-chilling roar, Faramir fell to his knees in exhaustion and said only, "Thank goodness for traps..."

AF - Glorfindel. The only obvious choice.

AG - Aragorn(Lo). I think I actually might play Boromir more since I do favor the tactics sphere but Striders card is one of those unique heroes containing bottled lightning. A perfect storm of great art, fantastic history, unique ability, and incredible attatchments and support cards. Between the two humans you have to give it over to the King over the Stewards son.

AH - Eowyn. Surprisingly considering I did not vote for her in the last round, but since she beat out Hama... one of my favorite tactical heroes... well I prefer straight up willpower to roundabout Questing anyway. Go eowyn! (Also, this one is def a strange vote considering I actually prefer Legolas as a character to eowyn)

AI - Sam. aaaaaaaaaargh why are the best dwarf and best hobbit facing off?

AJ - Denethor. Hahahaha

AK - Elrond. I'm really surprised Frodo didn't make it farther. I really don't care for Bard, despite his accomplishments.

Thanks for voting! The count is now updated.

 

Thanks to Rainelotr for his fun commentary.

 

Match-up update!!!

 

Boromir, I am your father...

 

We are down to the Sweet 16 and the match-ups are getting pretty intense. Especially one match-up between a father and son. Boromir (Le) is facing off against his own father, Denethor. They are currenty all tied up at 4-4 and are campaigning hard for your votes.

 

Boromir, "I thought retaking Osgiliath was hard, but it's nothing compared to this battle with my own father. You never know your own kin until you are locked in a battle with them. I mean he was all lovey and mushy before the battle. He would say things like, 'Come here, little Bori-Bori.' Man, I like that nickname. Now he's a stone-cold killer sticking to machinations and intrigue. It's... scary..."

 

Denethor responded, "Of course I still love my son, Boromir...but...Faramir is growing on me all the time."

A special note from Glorfindel (Lore).

 

"I just wanted to thank everyone out there for there support. Taking down Hirluin the Fair in the first could not have been better. The line was not looking good for me, but you all pulled me through. I even scored three votes on Elrond! That saved me from a lot of awkward dinners in Rivendell. Special out to those three votes: Ana, GrandSpleen and benhanses (YOU ARE THE MAN, BENHANSES!!!). I found a new source of confidence and am now ready to go a questing with all those who call! I don't even care about that other guy."

AE. Glorfindel.

AF. Boromir.

AG. Faramir. Would be fun if both brothers upset the usurper from the North.

AH. Legolas. Éowyn needs a better pic.

AI. Sam Gamgee. Didn't know he stood for artificial intelligence, though.

AJ. Boromir. It is interesting face off to say the least. I'm afraid it is much more likely to be double Aragorn in the quarters but I wish it'd be double Boromir.

AK. Bard the Bowman. He says "go back to your cave, half-elf".

AL. Merry. Cannot wait for the hobbit assassin of evil.

Gone from the internet for five days, and I've missed this cool threat. Well, I'm glad most of my favourites are still in the game, so here are my votes for the round of 16:

 

AE - Gimli (great character, excellent card, cute LEGO figure) 

AF - Aragorn (Lore; both fantastic heroes with amazing abilities - Boromir gets my vote in another match-up)

AG - Faramir (my favourite Tolkien character will get my vote in every match-up)

AH - Eowyn (always played by my wife in coop games, thus an easy choice)

AI - Dain Ironfoot (tough one, but I'll go with the King of Erebor, who helped me in so many quests over the unproven hobbit)

AJ - Boromir (hopefully, he'll be the future cornerstone of Gondor decks)

AK - Elrond (as one-sided as it can get)

AL - Beregond (love his loyalty in the novel, love his hero card)

## 87 [DevastazioneH88 on September 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=861165)

AE - Glorfindel - no need for an explanation

 

AF - Boromir - Tactics (almosto) always wins (for me XD)

 

AG - Aragorn - I like Faramir better as a character but I still haven't had a chance to try him, while Aragorn (Le) is a pretty big insurance)

 

AH - Legolas - well after the departure of mi dearest Hama he's gonna be my flag man (elf)...well he was going to be anyway

 

AI - Sam - I know I'll love him, one of my favourite characters in the books and now one of the best heroes, looking forward to try him

 

AJ - Denethor - I still can't find a good use for Boromir (Le)...

 

AK - Elrond - as much as I like Bard as a character...in this game Elrond's just a much better hero...so even if it grieves me I'l vote for him...

 

AL - Merry - Toughest decision...between two fellow tactics heroes...both of which I think are great. My favourite character between the two is Beregond but Merry's hero version is really cool and I'm really looking forward to use this little 6 threat tactics hero with 2 WP...(3 if you have Theoden)

AE.  Glorfindel.  Why?  Because he's freaking GLORFINDEL.  Firstborn, seen Valinor, even lent Frodo his horse.  How can you beat that?

AF.  Aragorn.  So much awesome. 

AF.  Faramir.  Because I like the other Aragorn better than this one, and because I like Lore and because Faramir is very cool.

AH.  Legolas.  Tough one, but I feel Legolas is more versatile than the overly lopsided Éowyn.  

AI.  Samwise.  I love the hobbits, and Sam is the bomb.

AJ.  Boromir.  Sorry Denethor, the art, the power, the ability has to go to Boromir here.

AK.  Elrond.  Really?  Elrond vs. Bard?  That's ridiculous.  Elrond and his ring just plain wins.  He is the definition of broken (and in a good way).

AL.  Merry.  No disrespect to Beregond, a mighty and worthy foe, but Meriadoc Brandybuck helped take out the fraggin Witch-King.  What has Beregond done lately?

## 90 [Teamjimby on September 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=861330)

AE: Glorfindel - I'd be surprised if he doesn't make the final 4.

AF: Aragorn - I didn't vote for either of these guys last round, but I'll take Aragorn because of his art.  Plus, I wanted Pippin to move on and Boromir ended that.

AG: Faramir - A fan favorite, and we don't need two Aragorns.

AH: Legolas - He might go all the way.  Eowyn is great, but maybe too one dimensional.

AI: Sam Gamgee - Despite my general refusal to vote for Dain because he's broken, I would still vote for Sam because IMO he's the best leadership hero in the game.  Plus I love hobbits.

AJ: Denethor - Purely because Gondor synergy is underdeveloped and Boromir's ability is useless.

AK: Elrond - Sorry Bard, you can't compare.

AL: Merry - By far he hardest pick for me as I love both of these heroes.  Gotta stick with my Hobbit love even though I have used Beregond more than any other hero since he got released.

Dang.  Now the "REAL" fights begin.  Up til now it's all been parking-lot stabbings and back-alley scuffles...  Now, we're talking Vegas rings and lights, Baby!

 

 

 

AG - Faramir.  FTW.  Don't even need to vote for any other match-ups... only one that matters to me.

I'm casting this vote under protest, since all of the bears have been voted off!

 

I do have one question for pretty-boy Faramir, "Where were you in the Battle of Five Armies?"

 

What's that? you were not even born yet? Oh well, that's too bad.

## 93 [Pharmboys2013 on September 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=861460)

AE - Glorfindel (spirit) - I like Gimli, I really do, but I'm almost surprised he made it past Ori.  Glorfindel on the other hand is a **** locomotive.  He's gonna run train on anything in his path.

 

AF - Aragorn - Really good matchup.  I truly appreciate Boromir's ability to just go bezerker over all the enemies in the field, but in the end I have to go to the man with the pipe (is it even a pipe? hard to tell...lets say its a pipe) and sweet beer stein over the man who looks like he may have a lazy eye at best.

 

AG - Faramir - Another great matchup.  I already voted for Aragorn once already though and Faramir is still the fan favorite.  Doesnt hurt he's the headliner of a fun new deck archetype either whilst leadership Aragorn may feel a bit aged (although certainly not any less useful) at this point.

 

AH - Legolas - As I said in my last vote featuring Eowyn, shes awesome but shes a one trick pony.  I value versatility.  While Legolas is also obviously used for one purpose alone, his progress ability and the fact that "ranged" is practically its own play style puts him on top for me.

 

AI - Sam Gamgee - Seems ever so appropriate that the farmer from the shire can/should overthrow the king of the dwarves.  If only the Gaffer could see him now.

 

AJ - Denethor - Really tough decision again.  In the end tho, Boromir's spectacular art can only take him so far.  He should be proud to have made it to this point, but its time for daddy to take the reigns.

 

AK - Elrond - Another case of art being only able to take you so far.  Sorry Bard, but Elrond is just a blast to play with and features an amazing depiction.

 

AL - Beregond - The stout defender is probably my favorite tactics character there is.  There's nothing like the comfortability of playing with an absolute wall.  Hoping Beregond makes it to the elite 8

## 94 [Mr Coffee on September 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=861467)

Okay fine, the other matchups DO matter to me... lol:

 

AE - Glorfindel (S).  If Vegas had a line on this competition (they don't, do they?  Or is there some action I can get in on that anyone knows about?), they would probably have this guy definitely slotted for a final four appearance, if not have him as the odds-on favorite.  I love Gimli's thematic revenge tank-attack deal, but if they were both professional baseball players, Gimli would be a hard-slugging DH (or lumbering 3B at best), while Glorfindel would be the guy serving a 50-game suspension.  'Cause he is CLEARLY on PED's (performance enhancing drugs).

 

AF - Aragorn (Lo).  "Denethor's Bane" vs "Denethor's Baern".  Possibly the toughest matchup of this round to choose.  Boromir has ALWAYS been a more than playable hero in this game, and is looking to get some fresh spins when the next AP hits and his machine gun tough-guy antics can go cray-cray... but... ALL HAIL THE KING!   A-LO's ability is just too good, especially when he really made it so much easier for everyone to unchain themselves from the threat-reduction of Spirit.  He's one of those rare characters that breaks the sphere-mold.  Boromir epitomizes the best of Tactics.  Aragorn just ignores sphere dependency all together.  Besides, I had to have ONE Aragorn make it through this round.

 

Because.....

 

AG - FARAMIR!  FARAMIR!  FARAMIR!   FAR.  A.  MEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!! 

 

(as for an actual semit-rational explanation... This is a vote of heart for me.  In case anyone hasn't read any of my other blurbs in the previous rounds, Faramir is my guy.  Plain and simple.  If Eru Iluvator himself were in this competition against Faramir... I'd kick open the Door of Night myself and jump into the void with Melkor rather than vote against Faramir.)

 

AH - Legolas.  Legolas just keeps getting better as this game goes on with every new ranged combo they throw out there.  And as strong as Gimli and Boromir are, Legolas is the TRUE star of Tactics, as the only real option for "bow-questing" in that sphere.  And quite bluntly, I didn't vote for Eowyn the last round either.  While she was the Spirit poster-child when this game started, Spirit has out-grown her.  Just because she's pretty and has huge..... will-power, I'm not gonna let that distract me!   There is so much more to the sphere now, without getting away from its roots as being the questing king.  I can't vote for Eowyn, who isn't even the best Spirit hero (Glorfindel and Frodo are vastly superior), over Legolas, arguably the best Tactics hero.

 

AI - Sam Gamgee - To a lesser degree, this is also a heart vote.  But since Tolkien pretty much said that the LOTR really becomes a story about Sam as the hero, even over Frodo, I'm gonna have to side with the Master and pick Sam.  I've definitely gotten my fair share of wins with Dain at the helm of the dwarven-horde ship, but my nostalgia with this OP hero cannot surpass my affection for the best hero in the books!  And Sam is also getting my "super-excited-for-the-Black-Riders-and-I-wanna-play-Hobbits-RIGHT-NOW" vote.

 

AJ - Boromir (Le).  I really haven't used either of these too much, although Denethor has helped me out in a pinch from time to time.  But the truth is that BoLe hasn't yet reached his potential, as FFG kinda misled us into thinking they were gonna build an impressive Gondorian machine around him.  And while he's seen some nice allies dropped in around him, his true potential as a Gondorian leader is ahead of him, I believe....  When it comes down to it, I had to vote son over father because I wanted at least one Boromir to continue on.

 

AK - Elrond.  I so wanted to vote Bard here.  I thought of using my "artwork vote" for this round to justify picking him.  But I can't.  I love Bard's ability (once unleashed by the ranged support cards), but Elrond is just too **** overwhelming.  Even before you add his ring and a little Stargazing to make him a juggernaut.  You want to double up all your healing?  You got it.  You wanna ignore sphere payment loyalties for any ally you want?  Done.....  He even LOOKS overwhelming on his card, standing there all smug-like with his arms crossed, with a glorious landscape backdropped behind him.  Does it look like he's intimidated AT ALL by Bard drawing an arrow out of his quiver??  No.  He does not.  I hate that he's such an arrogant SOB.  But I yield to his sheer awesomeness.

 

AL - Merry.  That is all.

No, really though.... Merry has me all excited.  That matchup with Beregond is an interesting one.  All-Tactics.  Offense vs. Defense.  "Machine-Gun Merry" trying to find someone else to bring alongside of him to tag-team "Big Boy Beregond".  Neither of them can claim the "unique" factor within their sphere (reference entry for Loragorn), there are other heroes that are really good attack and defense.  Beregond probably should get the "Wolverine" vote - (he's the best at what he does).  But here's where I'm going to drop my "artwork" vote for Merry to squeek him onto the next round.  I just love his card.  That art.  That ability.  There's just nothing NOT to love about a hero that we haven't even been able to play with yet...

Loving all the commentary and thanks for the final note from Glofindel! that match was a treat :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks for voting. The count has now been updated including Rainelotr's vote for Aragron (Le).

 

Special thanks to Ana, Ithilien Ranger (welcome to the thread!), DevastazioneH88, Morithain, Teamjimby, Pharmboys2013, benhanses. Your commentary is welcome and appreciated.

 

Match-up Update: The battle between Denethor and Boromir (Le) remains the closest fought match of the round.

 

Boromir commented, "I'm not one for spoilers, but this time I will make an exception. You know my dad... he dies in the end."

 

Denthor responded, "Well, I'd hate to break it to you, but those arrows in your chest are not for decoration. I shed quite a few tears on your behalf and I was quite alive when that happened."

 

Match-up Spotlight:

 

THE KING UNDER THE MOUNTAIN VS THE GARDENER

 

Dain Ironfoot is facing off against Sam Gamgee. They are both short and they both like good food, but that's about where the comparisons end. And so far Sam is having no trouble dealing with the King of Erebor. Sam leads the contest 14-7 and is looking for the upset.

 

Dain Ironfoot seemed to be a little bit worried while we had access to his throne room. He said, "The match-up with Nori was funny, but this is NOT funny. I mean I am THE dwarf and the dwarf king for that matter. I am absolute necessary for all of your dwarf decks and my ability is NUTS! I kick encounter deck butt. No one should have a problem with that. But nooooooo... I'm losing to a hobbit. I am not sure I know what a hobbit is."

 

Sam responds, "It's hard to keep my mind on this battle. I'm very distracted by the battle between Bard and Elrond. Mr. Frodo must be avenged. Mr. Frodo says to me, 'Don't let that Bard or even Elrond past you, Samwise Gamgee.' And I don't intend to."
