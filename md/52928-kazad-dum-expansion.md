Love it. And with the spoiled quest cards we know two out of three scenario names.

3 copies of player cards = win! though with 9 encounter sets that might not leave much room for player cards.

Can you say, "viable dwarf deck?"  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Now I'm pumped. Going to go play.

Oh yeah, play this while staring at the box art.

I think a lot of us were expecting and waiting for this :-)

I'm not interested in the smaller packs, but I will pre-order this one - hope FFG will print enough. However, I counted on it have 50% player cards and 50% encounter cards... hope this is the case... if there are only two new heroes - I will be disappointed...

Also, the box art seems beautiful, just if it is a large box like the core game I won't have space for it :-(

Interesting to get a hint into how the game may be formatted going forward. It seems to suggest that the next cycle's encounter decks will not need Core Set's encounters. I like that. I think by doing this, they may be providing for starting points for future new players. Get the core set(it doesn't seem like these deluxe expansions will bring enough player cards on their own), a deluxe expansion and start from there without having to buy every adventure pack ever made beforehand. You can pick and choose those. I know this is becoming an issue in Warhammer and it seems like it may be avoided here.

Honestly, I'm hoping that they might use cards from both the core set and the Khazad Dum expansion together in Adventure Packs. More combinations means more replayability.

There are two heroes. Including the heroes in the APs and core sets, that's 20 heroes, 14 if you only have the core set and this expansion. Quite a variety. Buy an AP and see how you like it. They're all pretty good so far.  At least get Carrock.  The box size for the deluxe expansion will be 8x8x1.5 inches.  The set has 165 cards. Even if only a third of them are player cards, that still leaves room for four new cards per sphere and one or two neutral cards. That alone increases  the card pool by about a third for players who only own the core set.  Plus three new scenarios, bringing the number to six scenarios for you, and up to twelve (13 with Massing at Osgiliath on POD) for people who purchase APs.  Why are you disappointed?

I suppose they could. The Core Set will still have to be bought for the sake of having a player card pool. Probably will see a lot less action, I hope. I wonder how many player cards will get in truth. Nine encounter decks is quite a bit. If we go by the Core set's encounters we could assume an average of 12 or so cards per encounter. That's 108 encounter cards. Leaves 57, which in threes is 19 cards. I think qwertyuiop might be right, we may be looking at about a third of them being player cards. That may end up being about 20 player cards here.

December might be a sensible guess, since the current cycle is slated to finish in November. Wonder if we'll see a Balrog now that we've been threatened with older and fouler things than orcs?

I figure the Balrog might be the big baddie for the hardest of the three scenarios, this set's Nazgul. Though maybe the scenario will be about escaping before he can attack you.

Man, I am excited. Still working on getting my copy of Rhosgobel (game seems to be selling well around here) and I'm eager to see the rest of the Mirkwood cycle but this Khazad Dum announcement has me all tingly in my special place. I was thinking we might see two adventure pack cycles between each expansion set so seeing that one is coming in 2011 was surprising news.

I need a new job. Gotta support my addiction, you know how it is. *twitches*

## 19 [Puzzle2 on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526307)

 I feel the same way. Due to moving this summer I just picked up the past two AP's and I haven't even had a chance to play through Rhosgobel yet. Now they announce this to tease me even more. I need to save up my pennies to make sure I am all caught up by the time this comes out. This is a pre-order for sure.

Brilliant. This sounds absolutely perfect.

165 cards - same size as the standard big-box expansions for AGoT (and probably Warhammer etc?)

like the 9 encounter sets / 3 cards ratio - seems like we'll get the max mileage from the encounter sets with the next cycle- really like the fact that the encounter sets will be re-used in the next cycle. I like the current quests, but there's only so many times I want to see the same Orc, Eastern crow, or get caught in a web.

Be interested to see what the card ratios are- probably won't be masses of player cards, hope they make them good ones.

Simple: My gaming budget is limited, so between RPG's and board/card games, getting the deluxe expansion will eat up my funds for this game.. so no AP's for me.
Since the core set is limited by itself for deckbuilding, my hope is that using it together with the first deluxe expansion I will get decent (not great) deckbuilding options - including a new hero for each sphere for the variety, and enough players cards. My assumption was that since the small expansions have 50% player's cards and that the core set has ~80 encounter cards, that it was reasonable to expect the deluxe pack to have a 50%/50% split between player and encounters - and still have 3 new quests.

As I have said, I'm still going to pre-order, and we have to remember that we don't have the final info on the product - so it might 50%/50% and I wll be one very happy camper. But even if it will have ~33% player cards, I will still get it ...

Are you attempting to add X tokens? But X isn't a number, its a variable.

No, you will know what card is on top of the player's deck after having played Gandal's Search, so it will be rather easy guessing the correct cost/number afterwards...

 

(and it was a joke, Gandalf's Search still sucks...)

Fighting a Balrog would be awesome, but what would be the difficulty level for that scenario? 12?

Can't wait!!!!!

## 29 [Vyron2 on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526419)

 the only thing with a balrog I could imagine is: in the last AP of the Dwarrowdelf Cycle you MUST FLEE from him, HE is kind of CHASING YOU and if he gets you, well good night!

 

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE for the party as such to defeat the Balrog - even Gandalf nearly died (and he is a Maia!!!) - the Balrog is on par with Sauron himself! Having been on of the generals of Morgoth (for all who don't know what I'm talking about - read Silmarillion)!!!! He absolutely CANNOT be beaten! Trust me... at least, if they keep to the books, i.e.... and it would kind of defeat the purpose - oh, I walk with gimli, legolas, AND aragorn, heck, why not bilbo AND frodo into moria and defeat the balrog... or flee from him... only to do so AGAIN 17 years later (in the books/movie)... kinda stupid, wouldn't you think?

"Oh, yeah, Balrog, that bugger... well, let's visit him again, shall we? We nearly died the last time we saw him... what the hell! We have Gandalf now :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] and Merry and Pippin :-P"

 

As much as I love the Balrog (esp in MECCG!!!!), I'd rather not see him FIGHT the "fellowship".... he can chase them or whatever, but... you get me

yeah i think it will be a vitory condition, not an enemy. i dont think theres much chance of it being left out, being a key enemy in the entire history of middle earth

## 31 [Shelfwear on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526434)

He guess he could appear as an encounter enemy card but not as one meant to be killed: Put into play like the two Nazguls in Dol Guldur/Osgiliath during the last stage with ridiculous high defence and life (or even without stats expect threat) adding his threat to the staging area while the heroes try to finish questing the last quest card...

## 32 [Mighty Jim 83 on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526440)

Glorfindel can kill Balrogs, he's done it before.

 

Given the news that this pack will be needed to play all of the expansions from the second cycle, what are the odds it'll be out of print and out of stock by the time the first AP comes out?

## 33 [richsabre on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526446)

thats a very good point, FF will have to print more than they did with HFG, seeing as this is a deluxe expansion and is critical for the purchase of the following cycle.

 

it would be very bad for business if they needed to reprint kazad dum because no one could buy the packs coming out

## 34 [Keggy on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526447)

So, Spirit and Lore Dwarf heroes?  Kinda makes sense, it will make sure everyone has one.

I was wondering how they were going to balance out the two extra heroes from the 5th and 6th APs, and now I know.  And if we really are getting some bearded goodness for the blue and green decks, then we can probably expect another hero for both Tactics and Leadership?

## 35 [Vyron2 on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526491)

 well... Boromir is pretty sure to come up sometime soon, right?

and THORIN!!!!!!!! WHERE's THORIN!!!! it was one of the first artworks shown to us (thanks again, Tiziano) and I want him!!!!!!! NOW!!! ;-) so probably we'll see him in the Deluxe Pack or even earlier :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

it would be interesting to know, whether they'll print Faramir as a Hero sometime in the future... given that he's an ally already... or Beorn, or even Gandalf?!??

Palando and Alatar would be great also as allies... maybe even Saruman? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] we'll, guess he's got too many colours already, so he won't help us :S

 

sorry, can't form clear thoughts about this, still too euphoric about the Deluxe Pack...

 

what do you think? will they add new KEYWORDS, i.e. new rules? Will there maybe be an official FAQ attached? you know, the one we've been waiting for since... ??? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

## 36 [richsabre on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526502)

im not sure palando and alatar would be included in this game, their works being in the east and nothing is wrote of them (save a line or two) in the hobbit or trilogy, only in the unfinished tales, so would FFG bring them this far into their own story telling? be interesting if they did though i think it would be hard for them to justify it

## 37 [The Strolling Bones on September 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526534)

Quite an exciting announcement. I'm still trying to adjust to a regular Adventure Pack release. Dwarves are great and I like that there will be "hoards" of Orcs and Goblins!  This makes veteran axehead a more viable card in my deck building strategy. ****, I am excited for the Balrog aspect, I have a feeling that will be an epic quest.

I really hope they emphasize equipment attachments more as well. Mithril for sure.

but why else the image? wasn't he supposed to come out? or why is there a painting depicting him?

## 40 [Oshio on September 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526693)

Very excited about this. A couple of thoughts:

Creating 9 new encounter sets to be used for the next arc is setting a really good precedent, I was worried that they would keep pulling from the core set. This also means a whole ton of possible combinations for possible 'online scenarios' which I'm still crossing my fingers that they will start putting out using random combinations of encounter sets.

I really like the idea of a 'theme set' and look forward to the endless possibilities that lie there.

With said 9 encounter sets, it sounds like there really won't be a whole lot of room for player cards, which is the only disappointing thing here. With 2 heroes I assume it will be about 2 normal packs worth of cards, where we really need more. The deluxe expansions are an opportunity to inject a lot of new player cards into the mix, and I'd really like another 'big box' like the base set.

All in all, very excited, especially as it will be coming out (relatively) soon.

## 41 [Eryx_UK on September 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526721)

Bear in mind that these games reflect a "what if" scenario rather than something canon, so it doesn't matter whether a character is alive or dead, or whether they wouldn't have been on these quests at this time frame.

I love the setting of the dungeon. Darkness, corridors, traps. Sounds like fun!

For me encounters decks mean more than player card, so I will be happy if there will be 2:1 ratio.

New encounters is definitely awesome... but I really would like to see some more player cards so we can get some better deck building going on.

Actually, I'd pay for a deluxe expansion with all player cards just to have a nice large pool of cards to build decks from.

 I was hoping for a deluxe set that was mostly player cards for the same reason.  I guess they need to expand the encounter sets just as badly though.

In time we'll have plenty of everything. What would be nice is if they released say 2 deluxe expansions at the same time... one with encounters for people who wanted more of those and one with player cards for people who wanted more deck building options.

## 46 [The Strolling Bones on September 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=526823)

I assume that we will see 3 each of 5 cards per sphere + 2-4 heroes so roughly 65 player cards this leaves 100 cards for the 9 encounter sets which might not be enough. So I may be a tad too optimistic on the player card side of things. Although 11 cards for each of the encounters sounds quite reasonable; however maybe we will only get 3 each of 4 cards per sphere and 2 heroes. That leaves 115 encounter cards or just shy of 13 cards per encounter set.

I agree with those of you who would like to see more player cards as I really want to be able to explore more deck building strategies. I'd love to be able to run a 4 sphere deck, although the other 2 songs (Tactics, and Spirit) need to be released to make this viable. I'm still a little underwhelmed at the options we have as players to thwart the difficult quests and the fact the Shield wall is currently only viable in a Mono Tactics deck is quite bunk. I'd like to see another Deluxe expansion that focuses on player cards although it makes sense for Khazad-dum to be more encounter heavy.

I agree with those of you who would like to see more player cards as I really want to be able to explore more deck building strategies. I'd love to be able to run a 4 sphere deck, although the other 2 songs (Tactics, and Spirit) need to be released to make this viable. I'm still a little underwhelmed at the options we have as players to thwart the difficult quests and the fact the Shield wall is currently only viable in a Mono Tactics deck is quite bunk. I'd like to see another Deluxe expansion that focuses on player cards although it makes sense for Khazad-dum to be more encounter heavy.



You don't include the quest cards for the 3 scenarios....

My analysis :

2 (Heroes)
+ 48 (3x 4 players cards in each of the 4 types)
+ 6 (3x 2 neutral cards)
+ 9/10 (3x 3 quest cards)
+ 99 (9x 11 cards per encounter decks)
= 165 cards !

Which leaves us with 2 new heroes in each sphere (assuming they make it logical) and 16 (x3) new cards in each sphere and probably 8 (x3) new neutral cards at the end of the first cycle+big expansion.
If FFG (EDGE in France, where I live) proposes this twice in a year, I sign now and every day... If only all the new stuff was usefull... But maybe in time ;-)

Does this mean that there will be a Deluxe Expansion before every Cycle?  Just wondering, because the Deluxe Expansion seems to include the Encounter decks for the following Cycle (where the first Cycle used the Encounter decks from the original release).

I'm pretty sure that FFG has followed that formula for all of their other LCGs, so I would imagine LOTR will follow suit.

Core + 6 adventure packs

Khazad Dum + 6 adventure packs

new expansion + 6 adventure packs

wash, rinse, repeat

Did they, though? For CoC it was different:

Core Set + Summons of the Deep AP + Dreamlands AP

Secrets of Arkham (Deluxe) + Yuggoth Contract AP

Order of Silver Twilight (Deluxe) + Rituals of the Order AP + Ancient Relics AP

Then there's the Forgotten Lore AP, including reprints from before the Core Set.

The ratio here is two AP cycles for each deluxe expansion.

Anyway, regarding the number of player cards in the Khazad Dum expansion, I strongly doubt there will be more than four cards per sphere. Adding the two heroes, that would be 50 cards. If there are 10 quest cards, 105 cards will be left to distribute over nine encounter symbols. That's 11-12 cards per symbol. That's close to what the Core Set had: There was an average of 12 cards per symbol.

I don't think that previous LCGs provide a good for the LotR production cycle. Two sets worth of APs would mean a whole lot of scenarios relying on an overused set of common encounter cards. I think the game needs a big box between each cycle to stay vibrant.

 Well, okay. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]  I guess I came to my "conclusion" solely based upon glancing at the Warhammer Invasion products page (which lists the core set, 3 deluxe expansions, and shows that they are currently on the 4th expansion pack cycle), and the assumptions I've pieced together from this forum and LOTR articles.  We'll have to see what it ends up being, but in any case, so long as they're pumping out new cards I'll probably be satisfied.

I was looking at card numbers on some of the previews to try and figure out whether we'll be seeing 4 or 5 cards per sphere.  With Khazad! Khazad! being 8,  Zigil Miner being 9, and adjusting for the 2 heroes, looks like only 3 per sphere.

## 57 [Svenn on September 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=531266)

Good eye/idea! I didn't even think about checking the card numbers. I suppose it's possible (yet highly unlikely) that the cards alternate spheres as the numbers go up, but I think 3 per sphere seems likely.

So let's see:
2 Heroes
36 Player cards (3 copies each of 3 per sphere)

That leaves 127 cards. I'm hoping for a few neutral player cards as well.

What about the Encounter/Quest cards we've seen. Perhaps the numbers on those can give us some insight into how many neutral cards or quest cards we might be getting.

So from reading the previous comments-am I to understand that the Khazad isnt an entirley new CORE SET in itself? Where I had to purchase 2 of the original Core to play more than 2 players. I am new to to LCGs, and LoTR is my first! I LOVE Lord of the Rings, and so I had to purchase this game!! I want to love it as much as I love the history behind the novels-but I'm ambivalent about whether or not I am playing it the right way. My friends have never played LCG's before-so this is all new to them as well, and of course I want them to love it as much as I do so I have people to play with. Thanks for your response!!

This is not a core set. You will still need a copy of the core set. This will add new quests, encounter sets, and player cards, but not enough player cards to build decks. There WILL be 3 of each player card, unlike the core set, so you will only need a single Khazad Dum expansion. Current estimates are that there will be about 3 new cards (and 3 copies of each of those cards, for a total of 9) for each sphere. There will also only be 2 new heroes.

Maybe.

Remember that there will be only two dwarf heroes. So my bet is that the spheres that will get new heroes will get one less card than the others.

On the Edge site (the french provider for LOTR LCG) it was talled that :
- There will be 2 heroes
- 2 spheres will get 2 new cards x3
- 2 spheres will get 3 new cards x3
- 1 neutral card x3

- 3 new scenarios (first you enter the mine (level 3), second you go trough the mines (level 5), third you get out the mines without getting lost (level 7))
- 9 new encounter set that will be used for the next adventure pack too

- New goblins, trolls and something "bigger and older"

Wow??!?!

Just went from pre-order status to wait and see.
If it is true, it will be a major disappointment for me. Was expecting to get enough player cards for me to decent deckbuild (casual gamer) without splashing on extra AP's. That is a paltry ~20% player cards in the set.

Hope it ain't true.

The primary purpose of the big box sets seems to be providing a sufficient variety of encounter cards to serve as the basis for the quests in the next arc of APs.  The sales strategy seems centered around the assumption that consumers purchase the monthly packs.

This is exactly what people asked for though, 3 copies of each card. This is going to limit the number of different cards in the pool since they can't do a bunch of cards with smaller quantities each and they also need to be able to fit in new quests and encounter cards.

Honestly, I don't see a reason not to buy the APs. They are so ridiculously cheap and you get a new adventure with each one.

LOTR isn't PvP

It's a coop. So the most important thing is to have cards (location, enemies) to beat. This is, for me, the main assumption that lies beneath the APs.

That is subjective and I respect it.

I did hope that FFG will also give support to customers who don't intend to buy every AP.... The yearly cost is 240 USD (Retail), which is roughly my yearly gaming budget.... and with all due respect, i'm not going to spend all of it on LotR LCG.

How do you get 240 USD? $15 retail x 12 (1 per month) = $180

Also, you don't have to buy all of the APs. You can pick up a few here and there. You can easily get them for well below the retail price if that is an issue as well.

Either way, what is it that people expect out of APs/expansions? Unlike most card games it's not ALL player cards. They need to keep a fresh pool of encounter cards and quests to keep it interesting, which means it's a lot harder to pump out tons of player cards.

You are forgetting the 2 deluxe packs a year, which are 30 each.

I agree that most of the cards should not be player's cards, but we did get in the core set 3 scenarios with encouner sets for the mirkwood cycle, using roughly 90 cards. So I think it is reasonable to expect at least 60 player cards in the expansion and even 70 should be doable. However, 35 (3*3*2 + 3*2*2 + 3*1 +2) is very low in my opinion, and makes the product not worth it.... and as a result the product line.

Which is sad for me, and the reason why I'm writing here.

I respect all players views, meanings and feelings :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] and don't want to provoke anyone. But my opinion about this game and it's AP and delux ex. is like, wow, a new piece of story and some cards to back it up. And by story I of cause mean the quests. The story is always great, for me being too easy, too hard and just in the middle :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Sure some cards I think are awesome, some are awfull and some are just meh ok. I have played it for about 3 months now, only beaten the first core set quest and still fighting the Anduin. I don't think this is a game where you should "pump-up-your-deck-and-have-3-of-all-great-cards" and then beat the game over and over again in a short period. Then you'll get bored no matter what FFG launches, how big the packages gets and how big the card pool gets. Just get 1 core set, sit back and enjoy the story in the game and get the AP's in your own tempo.

I haven't used as much time on playing the game as spending time reading about it on this forum, which is a lot actually :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but I have had a great time. Soon I'll have more time for playing and it'll be great too. Thank you for making and keeping this game alive FFG, and thank you for listening to us and make most of the gamers happy. For all to be happy we also need things WE don't think are great so others can be happy to :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 78 [soullos on September 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52928-kazad-dum-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=534839)

I actually like the idea of a new quest and encounter decks with each new AP/Expansion. At first I was thinking, "ugh, so few player cards." And, at the moment, yes that is the case if you have Core only and maybe a few AP (like myself). But one thing I noticed from many card games with their booster packs/expansion materials (random or not) is the fact that very few of the cards will see play, particularly from random distribution (I have thousands of Magic that I will never use…). At least with quests and encounter decks they will be used in its entirety. So that’s a good thing. I don’t feel like I spent $15 for just a handful of cards.

It’s also harder to break the game with overpowered encounter cards as compared to player cards. And should something like that happen, just drop the card from the deck. The encounter deck is always against you after all. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] An over powered player card will have more lasting and damaging effects to the game and with less player cards being made with each AP (compared to other card games), there will be less of a chance of something slipping through because of time/quota constraints. The designers can take their time to some extent.

IMO, this all adds great variety and longevity of the game without it spiraling out of control too quickly.

 As with any game...you take the good with the bad. Until they outright break the game or have a knee jerk new direction in the  story line, facing an army of Balrogs, all of it can be enjoyed. From my point of view there has been little to no bad. You also get out of any game what you put into it. I at first did not think i would have the money to afford everything. I took an evaluation of my spending habits; eating out, geekgasm spending, overspending on my hobbies, i.e. buying 3-4 packs when1-2 will do, how often I drove to my FLGS to hang out and not do anything...I curbed all of that and you know what??...I found the money I needed. Now I eat at home, only go to my FLGS on my hobby nights, apply some discipline to my spending habits in the store and most importantly enjoy my gaming experience to its fullest.

I don't think any of the packages they have come up with are any worse or better than the others. The one upside to this game is Solo play and if you are going to invest in ANY game this would be it. "I" also play Call of C'thulhu....I stress "I" because my group disappeared and now I am stuck with binders of cards and no one to play with. With LotR I don't have to worry about that so investing in it is a no brainer for me. I have played another CCG for 13 years now and have had multiple groups fall through (stupid college town) I can honestly say that I have cut back spending on that one too. 

Expansions like Kazad Dum are needed. They change the game state of things. Most of us have 1 deck that we feel confident in taking up against most quests, solo or team-up. These major Expansions change that and force us to have to build other decks. The more often you have to change your tactics to win the more you learn and the better player you become thus allowing the game to grow even more. Just look at the Eagle quest and how a smaller scale direction changed things for us. I can only drool at the possibilities of Kazad Dum. 

Another thing these Major expansions do is allow the design team to focus on one thing, DWARVES, and give players what they want. I am sure Elves and Hobbits will follow as well as maybe Rohan.  Playing through the caverns of the Dead Men of Dunharrow would be awesome!  In a way these are like big Christmas presents to the players that support the game.

I approve this message

This is very similar to my situation and I totally feel you on this point. This game is a god send for me since I love to play table top games and often its hard to find people who have similar interests and tastes in my area. Pretty much everything in my area is Warhammer 40k, MtG, DnD or bust. These big three just don't hold that much interest for me so a card game with solo play and a well done LotR theme is just a perfect combo. Especially since it will grow and evolve over time.

I also believe that its great that there is a very good focus toward the encounters.  A plethora of adventures to choose from will keep the game fresh and exciting. Ya it hurts player cards a little and makes the deck variety seem to feel like its growing pretty slowly, but I think that we, as players, will settle on the cards we think work the best for us so a large part of the experience will come from what we see getting fielded by the encounter deck as we play and how we choose field our cards against these different challenges.

A large box expansion like Kazad Dum will be nice because it will finally reset the basic decks since each adventure always takes at least two encounter sets from the core. KD will basically be the new 'core' for the next AP cycle and I am sure after nine adventures in mirkwood, I will be ready for a big change like that.

I personally think that FFG are doing a great job so far. I think most of us will agree that the way they released the core set wasn't the most collector-friendly decision, but I think that the card distribution in the Adventure Packs is just about right.

At first I was a bit sceptical, because I was worried about not getting enough new heroes or player cards. But soon I realized that in this case a slow growing card pool is not necessarily a bad thing, because you stay focused and maybe give some cards a chance that you would have ignored otherwise. (Makes me think about the many Magic cards I have in my collection that never got played and how much better I like the concept of LCGs.)

I also tend to be a bit more excited about the new set of encounter cards and the new quests, because they provide the much needed challenge and variety - which both are the engine to keep this game going! You can try to beat the latest quest with your old decks or you can modify your decks with the new player cards and see how you do against older quests - there are so many options...

I can't wait for the big box expansion and the following Adventure Pack cycle... but I also know that there'll be a lot of exciting LotR stuff to play around in the meantime!
