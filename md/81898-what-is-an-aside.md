hi, bought the core game and was looking online at a few sites for deckbuilding tips.  i came across a site and there was a space for an aside deck? what is this?   they had player deck,encounter,quest etc… and then a space to build an aside deck.  not  "a side" but aside. thanks

There are at least three quests that require you to build a second encounter deck and then put it aside, out of play, until a quest card instructs you to interact with it.  Those are We Must Away Ere Break of Day ("Sacked" deck), Over the Misty Mountains Grim, and Foundations of Stone.  I'm guessing this is what it is for.

And also, if I'm not mistaken the Smaug deck at Battle of Lake Town. But in this case it is not aside and out of play, just another encounter deck.

 

Someone correct me if i'm wrong

thanks guys. it was actually for cards that start the scenario outside of the deck. such as the hill troll in the 2nd core scenario. etc.. that way you dont have to search the deck at the beginning of the scenario.  thanks for the responses though.
