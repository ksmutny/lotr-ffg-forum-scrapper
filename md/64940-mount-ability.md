The new article talks about lore having a mount ally. Could we see a horse that improve the hero's stats and can be used to take some damage in stead of the hero? Or wil it be a sort of ally that kan only be played when ayour hero has the Warrior or Rohan trait? Go Shadowfax and Hasufeld!

 I hope it's more interesting than both the things you suggest.

Citadel plate already gives extra hp when played on a hero - plenty of attachments also boost stats. 

And if mounts are just allies that require something to be in play - that's just an ally with a requirement.

 

As a new card type - I want them to be functionally different.

 I would like the Mount to confer a new ability on the Hero.  For example, a Tactics Mount that allows the rider to attack the staging area ala Dunhere.  A Spirit Mount that gives +2 Willpower is only mildly interesting.

I agree, a new concept eould be nice! At first I thought it would be great to get extra willpower etc, but as previously stated loads of stuff does this already!

 

 Attacking into thr staging area would be nice, but this would make Dunhere a bit defunct!

I hope it is like

Cost: 2

Limit 1 per hero.

Exhaust "Mount" to give Attached Hero  +1 <wp> or +1 <as>(both if attached to a Warrior or Ranger) until the end of phase. 

Action: Put "Mount" back into your hand to ready attached Hero.

I somehow read "mountain" and wondered what kind of ally that would be…

hehe :-)

 

I wouldn't expect too much - nowhere on the news page FFG tells anything about a new card type or keyword. But it is written in bold and italic letters, so I guess it's only a new trait, like the already existing Noble or Creature.

This is just speculation, of course, but it would align better with the theme of the Darrowdelf cycle if mount meant more like "carrying things" than "riding".  In that case, an ally with mount might be able to enhance resource generation.

thats a unique take on it…..though ffg does have a habit of releasing un-thematic cards mid-cycle..so im gonna stick with riding

Pehaps it allows a character to wear more restricted attachments - or attachments become cheaper in general (like Good Meal for event cards). Or you can search for an attachment in one of your piles.

oooh i like that…well done

## 14 [radiskull on May 22, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64940-mount-ability/?do=findComment&comment=634529)

 I predict it will be an ally that has the ability to become an attachment, and has different abilities depending on which card type it's acting as.

Or it becomes a hero and makes the hero its attachment instead. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

I'm hypothesizing that Mounts will be allies that have the ability to (or are forced to) attach to another character. And then they will provide cool abilities and enhance the person that is attached to them, but could possibly die if that character takes enough damage. Like, damage has to go on them first when the rider would take damage.

From the note in the article I really think it shall not be an ally. But both the article and me have been wrong before. Still I guess it is an attachment with Mount trait.

Yes, that is my impression too.
It isn't very smart to introduce a whole new type of card, with another already announced (treasure) that hasn't even been published. It is too much to keep tracking and producing cards for every AP.

 

The 'three great' are enough already: Attachment/Event/Character.

 

Mesh attachment with character simply isn't a good idea.

## 19 [richsabre on May 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64940-mount-ability/?do=findComment&comment=635047)

i think we shall see a few more new types of cards a lot later on in the game….im having a hard time thinking what exactly but i think its inevitable….we've got treasure…i cant really think right now…all the things i can think of can be put into the main 3

## 20 [lleimmoen on May 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64940-mount-ability/?do=findComment&comment=635093)

Maybe some sort of a condition card, you know, not an ally or attachment but a permanent condition affecting the game; however, they already deal with those in simple ways, StwB affects all your characters but is only attached to Aragorn, for instance. So while it is perfectly possible that we shall see new types in the future I do not find it necessary at all.

## 21 [richsabre on May 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64940-mount-ability/?do=findComment&comment=635097)

ive thought of one….but i doubt that it will happen…..player location cards….ie inns/houses/cities…..i dont know how theyd work exactly…i mean you cant exactly play the white city…but its a thought..

## 22 [lleimmoen on May 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64940-mount-ability/?do=findComment&comment=635165)

You could certainly build a fort or an inn - great idea. But it could still be dealt with as a attachment that could only target (certain) locations.

One of the thoughts I had when thinking of possible player cards was this:

Battlefield

Tactics Attachment Cost 1

Attach to a locaton.

While the attached location is active Warrior characters get +1 Attack and +1 Defence.

aaahh…very nice idea….i like it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
