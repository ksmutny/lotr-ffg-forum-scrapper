Hey Guys,
Thought I'd drop a quick line in here that we're having a meetup/demo in Nashville today from 5:30-8:30pm at The Next Level Games in Rivergate. I don't know how many who visits this thread often is in this area, but figured it couldn't hurt to post it. We're having 5+ box sets available for play and at least one person to teach how to play at each table.

Cheers,

Will
