Finally I completed everything I wanted.
My Little Collection.
In addition to the pic, all PODs and NIGHTMAREs HD printed (in EU they are "impossible to find").
I love this game.

PS: I've never been interested in "Haradrim" and "Wilds of Rovanion". Please, tell me if u think the contrary! eheheh

I think both cycles are definitely worth it! Wilds of Rhovanion is one of the better cycles in the whole game, and Sands of Harad's player cards really round out a lot of the "not quite there yet" deck archetypes.

At first I was lukewarm for Haradrim but have since come around. At least get The Mumakil for those amazing allies. The Wilds of Rhovanion is also an amazing box. The Dale archetype is super fun and plays surprisingly well with a very small card pool. Think of it as a more toned down Outlands.

I just can't imagine being so into the game and yet writing off two entire cycles.

Now that I'm in, I'm in 100%. It's a terrible curse!

I haven't got to anything past lost realm yet as we had to do Saga's first but excited to one day play them all!

Wilds/EM is one of the best cycles.Â  Dale is both fun and powerful, but the cycle also gives us the basic for a Woodman (location attachment) and Beorning deck, plus (when the last deck is out) will take Eagles up a notch.Â  Also some great cards for Silvan and Hobbit.Â  Best of all is that since Dale is all about allies with attachments, there's a lot of ally-friendly attachments that can find a home in *any* deck featuring strong allies.

Harad has a unique/fun deck-in-the-box in their cycle, but in contrast to Outlands it is focused on a few unique and powerful allies, which independently can be useful in other decks.Â  Harad also has a wealth of cards designed for mixing spheres and types, which can be great for non-tribal decks.

Storywise Harad is themed around a migration of a Sauron-resisting Haradrim village from a land no longer safe for them; unless you feel that Haradrim should be uniformly evil I think you'll find the storyline available.Â  Wilds/EM is a more traditional theme, as you explore nasty areas north of Dale/Erebor looking for a dragon who is also looking for you.

My full collection (without nightmare decks) is almost complete - all saga expansions, all deluxe expansions and all adventure packs. I am just missing The Steward's Fear which I can't find anywhere. Do you guys happen to know where I can find it, even in used condition?

Also I am not posting a photo with my collection because it's pretty boring. I managed to get all the encounter cards in one box and all the player cards in one binder. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The Steward's Fear BGG entry has two copies for sale on the Geekmarket, but I don't think you speak Italian. ðŸ˜•

Yeah, there are several versions in German and French as well. I am looking for an English copy. I think I just found a forgotten English copy on a German site, hope the listing is true.

i have the same issue here with Mountain of fire, i'm from Italy and i searched every Italian/german/UK/Czech store, but i cannot find it for a human price (i.e. not 3 times the price).

I have all cycles and saga but i'm missing the last saga boxe, so disappointing .. since it's also a "recent" release :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Congratulations, no small feat, reprints being what they are.Â  Not sure why you wouldn't want the other two expansions, but oh well.Â Â 

I'm not sure if I'm going to collect the Nightmares or not.Â  As slow as my progress has been, at this rate I'd never get to them.Â  I've been playing for about 10 months now, and I've only completed the first cycle.

I understand you, I ended up buying my copy on a New Zealand website, having them ship it (free of cost since they share a postal system) to a friend of mine in Australia, who then shipped it by normal mail to me (for like 10 euro). It took two months total but at least it was a sane price.
