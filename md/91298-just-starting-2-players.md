# [Just Starting (2-players)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91298-just-starting-2-players/)

## 1 [Sephirex on September 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91298-just-starting-2-players/?do=findComment&comment=878342)

Probably a common question, but I couldn't find an answer   

 

Getting ready to start this with a friend.  We're planning on buying the cards and building our own decks separately, but we wanted to go through the quests in chronological order as a two-player team.

 

With that in mind,  how many cores should we each buy to get a good experience?  Expansions, Deluxe expansions, etc?

 

Thanks!   Looking forward to joining the community.

Welcome to the game!

 

There is only one copy of some key cards (like Unexpected Courage) in the Core Set. If you both want to fully enjoy the game, I'd recommend getting one core set each.

 

Other than that, go along with the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle adventure packs to get a better card pool. Khazad-Dûm is heavy on dwarf cards, but there is something for everyone. The Dwarrowdelf cycle has some great hero and ally cards. Depending on what kinds of decks you want to try, you might want to look at different adventure packs.

you can buy 1 core set between you and be fine. then you can of course buy 1 copy of each expansion after that.

 

i do have 2 core sets but only bought the other after playing for 2 years. a far quicker way to expand your card pool effectively is to buy the expansions

Thanks for the responses! 

 

Sounds like this will be cheaper than I'd planned.

There is www.cardgamedb.com [http://www.cardgamedb.com] in case you want to look up cards of a specific kind or sphere and plan what to buy, though that might take away some of the experience of collecting. It's often more fun to let your collection grow naturally and be surprised when opening up an expansion or adventure pack!

Regarding Core: Unless you both play the same sphere one core should be sufficient and split them up.

However if you want to purchase - planning on the fact that some day you both might not be able to get together anymore - I would go with one core each and you can borrow a couple cards from each other (document them) and return when you part ways.

Regarding expansions

If you are building decks on your own I would go with one expansion pack each. If you are trying to cut costs you can just build decks during your get together sessions and can rotate buying the expansion packs and be fine.

We're both collector fanatics, and we'd already decided we'll be buying the cards separately to appease our completionist tendencies.  

 

Either way, this is sounding quite doable, and since we'll be a quarantined play team we won't need to worry about keeping up with current releases.

It's a pretty affordable addiction.  I have every box and expansion pack there is for LOTR LCG and the total price is about the same as a single tier 1 deck of another popular CCG.

Now you just have to decide who gets all their Encounter cards scuffed up and who gets to keep theirs pristine ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
