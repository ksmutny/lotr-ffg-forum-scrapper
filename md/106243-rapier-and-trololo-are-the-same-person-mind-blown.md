That cannot be. Rapier is intelligent and contributes much to discussions on this Forum.

Why do you say they are the same?

Anyhoo, if you have such a suspect, you should be better talking to an administrator rather than posting this here publicly.

Lol.

I remember there once was a time where people actually discussed the game. Ah, what great times they where...

Great times indeed.

Edit: Seriously what are we meant to say to this?

Suppose they are, what is the problem? If you do not like their posts then just ignore them. I cannot see a point in such a topic

I remember there once was a time where people actually saw a joke as a joke... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

 

But seriously, they both share some traits like being fearless, convinced of their case and unbending. Like the three musketeers, with Rapier representing Aramis and Trololo being Porthos reloaded.

Clear case of cold turkey. We need that first adventure pack or the saga expansion asap.

Wow, this turned into circlejerk quickier than I expected. I won't say anything regarding this trololo nonsense, I will only say I miss the booored days. It was much funnier.

Booored was quite entertaining.

Lol, really: we need one more new game... NOW.

Leptokurt gets it. Thanks.

Also, +1 to boooored. His posts were one step shy of trolling, as he was sometimes right.

*raises a tall, cold one to boooored*

Oh the times me and booored clashed swords...fond memories. I remember once he said something very untrue about English people...quite offending really, but I miss it ... anyone want to take a stab at me? for old times sake? Perhaps it will make the forum feel like the old days? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

This was very funny thing of you to suggest, but I'm astonished by how many people took it seriously, even too seriosuly.

Rapier = Smeagol

Trololo = Gollum (obviously)
