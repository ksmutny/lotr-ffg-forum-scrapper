When the Lord of the Undead is engaged with a player, all printed text on characters is ignored. Is Derufin's text ignored as well? For example if its Dusk/Midnight does he still receive -1/-2 Willpower or does it remain at 3?

I have the same question.

What do you think about?

Technically Derufin should loose the 2 malus on willpower because you control him

Do you agree?

 

DERUFIN:

Gondor.   

Forced: After the players travel to The Stone of Erech, the first player gains control of Derufin.
Dusk. Derufin gets -1 Willpower
Midnight. Derufin gets -2 Willpower
If Derufin leaves play, the players lose the game.
 
 
THE LORD OF THE DEAD:
 
Undead.   Oathbreaker.   
Spectral.  
Cannot have attachments. While you are engaged with The Lord of the Dead, treat all printed text boxes on characters you control as if they were blank (except Traits.)

Technically he will loose his text so he stay at 3 willpower and, even more strange, he can die without making you loose. If I was playing this game I probably do as Derufin can't have his text blanked but it would be a correction, not the way the rules say it would work.

I think also that the final sentence "If Derufin leaves play, the players lose the game." should be active when he leave the game.

So the players lose the game in any case
