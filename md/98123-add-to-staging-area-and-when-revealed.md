Do when revealed effects trigger when you are forced to pick an enemy out of the encounter deck and add it to the staging area? Or only when you actually reveal it during the staging step? Thanks!

It depend the text that force to add the encounter card to staging. For example, if it reads: 'discard the top card of encounter deck and....' and it continues: 'reveal it and add to staging', so the 'when revealed' triggers.

Instead, if it continues: 'and add to staging', then not!

It depend of the text, if the word 'reveal' is displayed in.

Awesome, thanks for the reply! It just says add, so I didn't resolve the effect. That clears that up! =)
