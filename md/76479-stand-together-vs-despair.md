Does the Despair Treachery card cause all characters defending against an attack (thru the Stand Together card) to diregard their defense values or only one of them?

Any thoughts would be welcome.

I can´t say as I don´t have the cards in front of me right now but you do raise an interesting point about stand together. I wonder if stand together, could work with those shadow cards, that discard defending characters from play, to force you to discard all of the characters you used with stand together? I imagine that might well be the case
