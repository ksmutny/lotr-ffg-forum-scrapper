So who is everyone's favourite Hero at the moment? Wether for usefulness in game, artwork or general flavour!

 

For me at the moment it has to be Frodo! I find hobbits very useful and was playing him in a Spirit/Lore deck while my friend ran pure Leadership!

 

 Frodo with Fast Hitch, Burning Brand (song on him ofc) and the Dunedain card that gives +Def…… he makes an excellent all round Hero. He can defend 2 attacks a round with 3 Def… he barely ever takes dmg and if he does it can be used as threat. If not many enemies around he has a decent 2 WP for getting stuck into the quest, and can be readied and used in Def again if needed!

 I also think he has really good artwork (although most cards do!)

 

 So how about everyone else?

Gotta go with Boromir. Just such an overwhelming beast in combat. When you suit him up with Support of the Eagles, you actually HOPE several enemies come off the encounter deck, just so you can feed them to your Gondorian buzzsaw. Plus, he has one of the more thematic abilities in the game if you really need to get out of a jam.

Honorable Mention: Eleanor, Dain Ironfoot.

I must admit I havent really used Boromir very much since he was released. I see the obvious benefits of him, but im always wary of my threat sky rocketing by abusing his ability!

boromir + lore aragorn = win

Yeah, that is a good. Even adding Frodo to Strider and Boromir, starting threat is not that terribly high and you can abuse it for a while, collect threat reduction and use that right after Strider's ability. Pretty strong, Strider plus either (or both).

As to OP, I am terribly undecided but if held at point blank I would not hesitate saying Boromir as well.

## 6 [Budgernaut on May 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64693-who-is-your-current-favourite-hero/?do=findComment&comment=632364)

 My favorite is probably Dúnhere. I don't use him all the time, and he works best if you really focus on a low-threat strategy, but I love being able to pummel helpless enemies in the staging area. Get Unexpected Courage and some Dunedain Marks or other atk-boosters on him and he becomes a beast. Another problem for Dúnhere is the recent plethora of low-engagement cost enemies. That really ruins Dúnhere's day. So he's really not the most useful card, but I think he's super fun to play.

Boromir and Frodo are close behind Dúnhere, Frodo for his usefulness (especially with Fast Hitch), and Boromir because he's just so fun to use.

Hard choice between Frodo and Bilbo for me.  I have to go with Bilbo because without him, I would win a lot less solo games!  His extra card draw ability makes him my favorite!

## 8 [richsabre on May 17, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64693-who-is-your-current-favourite-hero/?do=findComment&comment=632488)

so far bilbo or frodo- purely because i love everything bagginsssssssss……..

I play with Bifur in every deck I'm using at the moment. He is cheap, has decent willpower and his ability is really, really good for multisphere decks like mine. Thalin, Théodred and Beravor are also very nice heroes.

I would say Bilbo because in solo is amazing, but that hair… so i say Frodo Baggins.

Made of wool - visibly.

If Boromir were my Tactics choice, Dúnhere is the Spirit choice, Imrahil for Leadership but I am still waiting for a Lore hero that I would become entangled with, Denethor or Bilbo are great solo, Beravor is super strong, Bifur a good buy surely but none are my "personal" favorites.

## 15 [DurinIII on May 18, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64693-who-is-your-current-favourite-hero/?do=findComment&comment=632664)

Yeah, it's the Hobbiton hairdressers. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I am with you guys, I don't like his hair either, but in a very weird way, there is a certain charm to the card.

Still has to be Beravor.

Even though she's not a "real" Lord of the Rings character, Tiziano Baracchi's artwork makes her feel like she's been in Middle Earth with all the other Heroes the whole time.

Beautiful artwork, decent well-rounded stats that can help quest/defend/attack wherever needed, and still one of the most powerful abilities in the game.

I really love Elladan and Elrohir. My favorite art plus they're rad thematically. I wish it were possible to use just the two of them but that's a little tough since they're out of Secrecy range after the first turn. I saw the other day that someone was using Loragorn and them in a deck which seems risky to me with that high threat but what the heck, why deny myself the pleasure of using my three favorite heroes!?!

Im a Bilbo fan too. His hair can penetrate orc armour, so with that special ability he will always be on my quests. There seriously WAS a Hobbiton hairdressers mentioned in the book and they apparently did a very good foot perm.

Hard choice… I would have to say Bilbo. His ability is just astounding.. drawing an extra card a turn makes deck flow so much easier.. it simply improves any deck immeasurably. It is stupid powerful in solo but is still extremely strong in a normal game. There is little to be upset about with this guy apart form having a low will.. but this can be fixed with CStone or something like that easily enough.

Hard choice though… Frodo is also crazy good… .

Same names keep popping up it seems!

 

 I am going to throw a new favourite in to the mix….. and it is a controversial one….

 

 Glorfindel! We have just started using him (despite being a core set character) due to his high threat being off putting!

 

 His ability to Quest well, attack well and still take a hit (5 wounds helps) makes him a very versatile choice! Add his ability to heal and he is a good solid all rounder! This is in a two player game ofc, but I dont see why he wouldnt be good for the single players out there!

Hi Narsil, I'm doing that and it's working pretty well.  (Though I freely admit Boromir & Frodo might work better with Loragorn, playing that group doesn't sit well with me thematically.)  The thing about playing with Loragorn is… you don't care about threat!  This is especially true if you've got a couple of other heroes that can handle all the enemies that come your way early.  I try to save up my Elrond's & Galadhrims (which I don't usually carry, but it depends on the quest) for AFTER I activate Loragorn.  Then, you usually have many of your attachments and allies in play and suddenly your threat is down to 26ish and it's open season on the quest.

As I said I find Strider, Frodo, Boromir interesting, even from the thematic point of view. But to really get most out of Strider, one needs a Leadership hero to be able to play the Stone and Sword - and doing it via the Song may not be very effective.

Agreed, but having a pair of Rivendell Minstrels in the deck can make fishing them out much easier.  Still, a Leadership hero is the best way to go.

I know this will sound weird but my Favorite is Glorifindel. I love him in the book, i love him when i see the game in internet first time(1 year ago) and i still love him now cose he is really cool in my opinion as a hero and art as well.

Yeah I have always found this wired me out G… I really think he so expensive threat wise. I always like low threat heroes. He is is versatile.. sure.. But having high attack means nothing if you are using his questing his defence sucks and he has a resource drain on him though his ability.. something that we have a few options to replicate like that new healing card that has no cost.

You can swap him out for a a dedicated quester or attacker and have them do it just as well for a fraction of the threat…

Am I the only one in the world who really loves destroying enemies at once with that mighty Dwarf son of Gloin? A Dwarven Axe and a Citadel Plate makes him look like Hulk in the mood! To say the truth I have to choose between Lore and Tactics Sphere as I generally play 2 or 3 players games and my teammates take Leadership and Spirit. Lately I start to really appreciate Boromir and his readying and rereadying ability! And of course I rarely remain Bilbo-less! Just bring me some Trolls!!!

I love both Hobbits and all of the dwarfs. Bifur most of all. Right now Loragorn is on his way to the top. But let's face it - the best of them all is…

While I enjoy playing Frodo, I have to say Thalin is my favorite hero. Low threat and can deal a bunch of damage during the staging phase while committing to the quest. And now with the new spirit attachment that readies a dwarf when you go to an underground or mountain location he is going to be 10x better (at least in this cycle).

Théodred is a hero that is a big in help in every deck. C'mon, one extra resource is probably the best support action except of Beravor's neverending card supply. He makes every deck easier to play and guarantees excellent results. Loragorn and Théodred isone of the most powerful hero combos so far, far better than Coragorn and Theo. Another awesome combo: Théodred + Bilbo. And: Théodred + Éowyn. He basically rocks in combination with spirit and lore, both spheres that have awesome, but expensive cards. He makes 3 sphere decks playable. Théodred + Bifur = Gildor out in round 2!

Plus: he gives you access to Steward of Gondor and Sneak Attack, two of the best cards in this game!

loraragorn and coragorn…….thats too much fight to figure out how to say….ill stick with tolkiens words….good enough for me…anyways i digress, my point i came here to say is that i have never found theodred that great. now this is probably down to my sucky ability but still, i have tried several times to get anywhere with him..just not my type of guy i guess

## 36 [Budgernaut on May 22, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64693-who-is-your-current-favourite-hero/?do=findComment&comment=634637)

Theodred's ability is good, and it is useful that he has access to Steward of Gondor, but his willpower alone won't get you through the quest phase, which means you'll be committing at least two heroes to the quest. Then you have only one hero to attack/defend. BUT, if you build your deck right, the allies should be able to compensate for the low willpower, and you could use Dunedain Quest and Celebrian's stone to pump up his willpower. Okay, you're right, he is a great hero. I just never thought I'd see him as a favorite.

He just gives you a good feeling - you don't only have awesome cards in your hand, you can even play them all! Btw I am always committing at least two heroes to the quest at the beginning of the game. If I have Frodo (sometimes even without him), all three. But its's true, using Théodred means a slow start, but the WP then accelerates quickly. I played a secrecy deck against Road to Rivendell with Théodred and Bilbo (and Arwen, obviously). It worked pretty well.

I think Théodred is the best leadership hero so far and maybe one of the best heroes overal. 1 Willpower okay, but 2 ressourcen each turn and don't forget, you can give the extra resource to any heros who is commited to the quest. In my deck i have about 85% allies so the 2 points of missing willpower are fixed in no time. And I'm playing solo without spirit ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

ok firstly this is coming from a solo player whose main play style revolves around card and resource draw…..despite this i just dont see anything going for theodred…you have to commit him to the quest to get the resource- in my books this is too much to ask of a 1 willpower hero, especially when fielding leadership you can get out steward prettty quickly with a fast draw which can give you 2 extra free per turn….i would say id save him for something else, but as his stats are also poor….this coupled with what (in my opinion) is actually one of the weaker hero abilities, make him my least played hero


in all my games i manage to have an abundance of resources, always without theodred, and with the new resourceful card, i think the chances of him seeing play in my games are now non existant….its just a waste of a hero slot in my opinion…which taking some of the replies on this thread of course is far different to what many think


guess he just doesnt suit my play style….plus the art is one of the rare examples of which i dislike….(which in my books is a good enough reason happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif])

With Theodred and SoG you get a resource rate of 200%! This is huge! I don't care about his low willpower if I'm able to play 2-3 allys per round. Hero stats are overrated if you have around 10+ allys in play and can play several new per round. It simply doesn't matter anymore.

If you have too many ressources, I think, you are doing something wrong ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

And the resourceful card isn't good if you don't play secrecy. It pays of after 4 rounds. An average game takes me 7 turns so it's not very "resourceful" at all.

My major heroes are Bifur, Beravor and Théodred and they are working really well together. If you want I can give you a decklist and you can try yourself.

## 41 [richsabre on May 25, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64693-who-is-your-current-favourite-hero/?do=findComment&comment=636143)

i didnt say i had too many resources- just an abundance- the point is i manage this without theodred, allowing me to field more powerfuland more importantly more widely spanning (ie not just resource draw covered, but readying, attack/willpower/defence buffs, card draw etc) combos of heros such as dain and two other dwarves such as bifur and gloin- this is my most winning deck, and with more and more dwarf cards comin out this cycle its getting steadily stronger

and with dain buffing up every dwarf ally's willpower, and with 7+ dwarf allies in at one go i reach the point that your deck has - many allies all paid for, all powering an extremely high willpowered deck…..only difference is there is no theodred so i can utilise other options such as arming all my heros with dwarven axes, erebor boots,dwarf readyin cards such as lure of moria  etc in which case you cant with theodred….fair enough you have a large amount of rohan readin cards- but they are spirit- and if you dont field spirit then its no good

so ok ok ok …..ill admit theodred is great  in that he is a resource machine…i just would never put him above dain as a more powerful leadership hero, i mean he gives +1 willpower to every dwarf character in play….thats a massive increase…ill just always have other methods that are getting me equal results that i find more desirable in deck synergies

anyways that just my take on it….but everyones different in their ways……and i respect your opinion on him happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]…

also i think answers to this question are bound to change as new cards come out and new ways are found to utilise heros abilites- so there may become a point where i do give in and use him

 The other thing that Theodred has going for him is his low starting threat. Aragorn, Imrahil, and Dain all cost 11 or 12. Theodred is only 8. This is actually a main reason for my including Theodred in my decks. Plus, he's great once you can get Celebrian's Stone on him. I haven't tried a cardraw/PoL deck yet. (that is to say, I only tried it on Return to Mirkwood which is not the most forgiving scenario). The decks I play most often are Rohan decks (hence my use of Theodred) and Tactics decks (in which I need resources to pay for expensive attachments). This difference in the decks we use is surely the reason we differ in our opinions of Theodred. I've been saying it for 3 or 4 months now, but I really need to try a Lore deck.

Indeed. I use a secrecy deck in 2-player games with Bifur and Théodred.
The deck is mostly expensive allies. Théodred is wonderful!

Rich, I know you don't like Horsies that much but do give poor Theodred a try one day. He can really accelarate the opening rounds and thus do for his low willpower. Especially with StwB, you shouldn't worry much about willpower once you get the deck going - and he will quest for at least 2. Cheers.

## 45 [FAAx87 on May 26, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64693-who-is-your-current-favourite-hero/?do=findComment&comment=636211)

@Rich: I'm playing a dwarf deck with Dain, Bifur and Thalin too. It works really great but the mayor problem is card draw. This was fixed a little bit with this green attachment (sorry, I don't know the englisch name of the cra;) ). But I still have to field Gleowine too to get all the important cards I need. And he isn't feeling too good in a "dwarf" deck. Besides of that you still habe to draw those cards. If you take Beravor, you can draw cards in every case.

So, the dwarve deck is good (and will get better with the last expansions and the hobbit expansion) but you have to build around it to get it going well. I have played both decks a lot and in my conclusion the non-dwarf decks feels a lot better to play.

Offtopic: And about Celebrians Stone: I thought about it on Théodred a lot. Maybe I will include it someday. But at the moment I prefer to play to play an ally like the Hammersmith (is he called this in english?) or something like that for the ressources (with Bifur you are very flexible, so don't worry about the different ressource colors ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) You can do a lot more with allies than with attachments in my opinion. Sometimes they don't look as strong as some attachment but there are rarely attachments who can block a troll for a round. I think you get my point.

@Rich: I'm playing a dwarf deck with Dain, Bifur and Thalin too. It works really great but the mayor problem is card draw. This was fixed a little bit with this green attachment (sorry, I don't know the englisch name of the cra;) ). But I still have to field Gleowine too to get all the important cards I need. And he isn't feeling too good in a "dwarf" deck. Besides of that you still habe to draw those cards. If you take Beravor, you can draw cards in every case.

So, the dwarve deck is good (and will get better with the last expansions and the hobbit expansion) but you have to build around it to get it going well. I have played both decks a lot and in my conclusion the non-dwarf decks feels a lot better to play.

Offtopic: And about Celebrians Stone: I thought about it on Théodred a lot. Maybe I will include it someday. But at the moment I prefer to play to play an ally like the Hammersmith (is he called this in english?) or something like that for the ressources (with Bifur you are very flexible, so don't worry about the different ressource colors ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) You can do a lot more with allies than with attachments in my opinion. Sometimes they don't look as strong as some attachment but there are rarely attachments who can block a troll for a round. I think you get my point. Long story short: allies > attachment (in many cases).

Yes! Yes it does!
I made few changes in the deck when moving to KD quests (I am still to play any Dwarrowdelf scenario), it works pretty much from Core to KD.

 

The other player's deck is what suffered most changes over the quests. In the end, the main problem with the Bifur/Théodred is the lack of draw; I usually end up with lots of expensive allies in play, Bifur with a thousand resources but very few cards in hand, so I added Beravor to the other deck.
It's being doing pretty well so far!

 

Give it a try, and then post your deck/experiences! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

@lleimmoen-  yes i have been promising to give him a try for a while now havnt i? i will give him another go with some dedicated deck time taking some of the ideas from this thread

@FAAx87- in regards to the stone - you can only put it only a hero….so i this case i think it would go best on theodred-or whoever is the designated quester

i agree with you, in most cases allies are greater than attatchments / events, though again it does depend what type of deck….though in just about every deck a large proportion needs to be allies- my decks are usually 50% allies 25/25% events/attatchemnets

Do you guys think the new tactics hero is to good? I mean a event fetch each tap? That is CRAZY powerful. Infinite feints.. all you need is to events to power that… combos with people like Watcher of the Bruinen.. we now have character target equipment to boost his attack + revendale blade.

Seams to be out of the box one of the most powerful heroes I have seen at first glance.

I'm still undecided as to whether Hama can toss out Legolas or Brand (Boro ain't leaving). Hama lacks Ranged which allows the other two to chip in on attacks against any Enemy in 2-player and still get their abilities into play (even if Brand has to attack another player's Enemy). In a solo game, I can see Hama bumping Lego and/or Brand because Ranged doesn't come into play, but in multi, not sure Hama will see action in my decks.

Yes, I think he can be super good but it usually needs be supported by card draw; first to get the Tactics event early enough, second to have cards for the exhange.

I think that really depends on the deck - and of course, coop/solo play. I think solo there is no question Hama is better, even than Legolas although his progress boost can be great in a right deck. In coop, beside the card draw, you shall probably need to either make Hama ranged or have a sentinel on the other side because it is likely you might not have enough defense on the same deck as Hama - but he can keep Feinting them…

ps: Hama actually ditched Boromir in my Rohan deck, but only for Boromir to appear in another deck… Boromir still remains my favourite Tactics hero, I know he's not always that useful but the times when he is just totally make up for that (for me), it is such fun to get out of trouble with Boromir's superior "readiness"

on the note of brand i was so dissapointed in his ability - taking his ability aside his stats are actually one of the best rounded set of all the heros…..a sort of tactics all rounder such as beravor (only with out the good ability)

But then, you do only play with yourself partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif] (by yourself?). Although, Brand is often called on to quest in my Tactics/Spirit deck, especially early on before the WP-allies show up, hopefully sooner than later. But haven't really gotten as much use out of his ability as I would've liked, but Ranged helps even if I don't get to use his ability.

Brand is excellent especially with Beravor on the other side of the table, acting as her Unexpected Courage as times - plus there is usually someone else also ready to be readied. His stats are really nice as he can quest occasionaly, not quest when you know you will be killing an enemy at the other side and defend when absolutely necessary.

I have been giving Háma some love lately, and made a deck around him, and I have to conclude that he is very playable and poweful. I tried both Eowyn, Théodred and Háma, which lacked card draw enough, and Eowyn, Beravor and Háma, which went better, and got a lot of cards for Háma to interchange. I was feinting again and again, and there were no one enemy that represented a trouble in this games. The keys were Feint, Quick Strike, Swift Strike, Unseen Strike and Hail of Stones… and tons of cards in my hand to recover them.

I really liked Háma I must say. Greetings.

I use exactly those Tactics events safe Swift Strike. I might reconsider that one as well as I also use Spearman in the deck. The thing is you sometimes do not wish to kill off the enemy before Háma can strike which is exactly what Spearman plus Swift Strike should do. At first though I felt compelled I would haveb to use Háma all the time to really make his ability worthwhile, in fact I learned it needs not be used very much to be effective, especially solo when you should not expect enemies every round.

I use the same hero alignment with a lot of success. The game was all about keeping a Feint in hand at all times (if not a couple). I never really abused Beravor + UC before, so a lot of the power was coming from there. But Hama rounds it out with solid defense.

In a two-player game, a mono-Tactics deck using Hama to recur Thicket of Spears is pretty entertaining. Just locks down enemy attacks whenever necessary. Requires a fairly substantial resource investment, but offers terrific board control.

It's somewhat abusive, but it does require you to run three Tactics heroes (or have Songs in play). Plus, it gives new life to a previously underutilized card, which is always nice to see.

I run a single copy of thicket in the Hama deck with supporting songs. It is rather resource hungry, so I don't think it is broken. But if you fall behind on managing enemies, it is a great option to keep from being overrun.

If I had to pick it'd be Gloin for myself I think! Love the artwork and is a handy resource builder if u can get Self Preservation on him and/or Steward of Gondor.  Also love Bilbo and Theodred and like how Denethor feels thematically with his action (the whole palantir thing).

they should make the palantir an attatchment (lore obviously) and make it that if you attatch it to characters with high enough willpower (to stop sauron driving you mad) you get denethors ability…..however before everytime you peek at the encounter deck, you have to discard the top card of it and if its an enemy then you have to raise your threat by (X) where X is the threat of that enemy

…..oh wait- thats a bit rubbish….thered be no point in its ability if you have to take a chance to look at the next card, you may as well take the chance anyways….oh well ive made the post now ……

Nonetheless, Palatír is another of many things we may be looking forward to seeing in this great game.

 Perhaps the palantir could be a 'treasure' card one day? maybe? With Denethor's action on it would be cool, tho I feel it won't happen because it'll render playing denethor a waste of time.

if it had a higher play 'cost' than denethor, ie worse than just exhausting then it would keep him valid and also provide a nice theme card

Interesting, until page 5 nobody mentioned Legolas or Eowyn! I prefer heroes that excell at a specific task (quest, attack, defend). Eowyn ist the best quester in the game (!) and Legolas is one of the best attackers (i rarely play solo).

However when it comes to whom i like most… Eowyn is great… but boring. You tap her in the quest phase without second thoughts and don't look at her until the next quest phase.

Therefore Legolas is my favourite. I like him in the books, i like archery, i like elves, i like his abillity. He is awesome combined with a weapon (like "rivendell blade") and strong in combination with "quick strike". He reliably strikes down one enemy per turn, wherever the need is greatest and meanwhile advances the quest too!

I usually play with Dain, Gloin, and Thalin as a team, or Gloin, green Glorfindel, and Beravor. However, having just received my five Dwerrodelf packs today, Hama may very quickly become a big favorite of mine to play.

I've enjoyed using him in a couple settings so far…  Have seen some decent success using him with Theoden and Beravor (get that resource and card-draw working right off the bat).  Just used him in a 3-person multiplayer game with that config (other decks were Dain-led dwarves and Loragorn-mixed deck)…  we stumbled and survived our way through the early stages of FoS, then blew through stages 3-5.

I was able to get Light and Asfaloth on him.  BEAST-MODE!

 

Aesthetically, I love the art-work for both versions of Glorfindel, so he's definitely near the top of my list right now…  Theoden has been there for sometime, hard to find a mix of heros that he can't benefit.  Beravor has been great so-far, even without the drawing, the stats are solid for any phase of a round (quest, defend, attack).  A UC on her becomes rediculous.
