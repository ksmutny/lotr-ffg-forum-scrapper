Watch Ricky Gervais playing pure solo. Wish he would have played it 2 players with Karl...

LOL! Yeah, he really sounds like him... and I was thinking of how cool it would be to see celebrities posting videos of them playing LOTR LCG!!!

I imagine a video of Al Pacino getting wiped by a nightmare quest and starting to shout out his comments...
