1. Battle of Five Armies

2. Seventh Level

3. Battle for Laketown

4. Helm's Deep

5. Encounter at Amon Din

6. The Morgul Vale

7. Trouble at Tharbad

8. Down the Anduin

9. Road to Rivendell

10. Shelob's Lair

I have a lot of easy quests because I love to test out a lot of wacky builds. I've probably played the Seventh Level more than any other quest. It is fast, simple, and fun. I also enjoy quests with a strong setting--they put you in a specific context with the narrative. I really love many other quests. It's difficult to cut it down to 10.

1. A Knife in the Dark - Awesome Quest!

2. Journey in the Dark - Awesome Quest!

3. Helm's Deep - Unique mechanics and great atmosphere!

4. The Stewert's Fear - High replayability and not that easy

5. The Morgul Vale - My favorite "boss-fight" quest

6. Deadmen's Dike - Nothing really special about this quest, but I like it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

7. Breaking of the Fellowship - Beats Foundations of Stone for me.

8. Temple of the Deceived - New and Shiny :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

9. The Battle of Carn Dûm - The hardest quest for me at the moment (nightmare excluded)

10. Escape from Mount Gram - Fun but easy^^

1. Into Ithilien (hands down, amazing quest)

2. Steward's Fear 

3. The Siege of Cair Andros

4. Journey Down the Anduin

5. Trouble in Tharbad (sooo thematic)

6. Battle of Five Armies

7. Journey in the Dark

8. A Shadow of the Past

9. A Knife in the Dark

10. Assault on Osgiliath

 

It was much harder to pick 10 quests than I though it would be. The first three are definitely my favourite ones (or the first five). Into Ithilien is simply amazing.

 

My favourite cycle by far is also HoN + AtS, as can be seen from my picks.

I have everything (non-nightmare) except for the against the shadow cycle and the APs in the Dreamchaser cycle.  Theme of the quest's mechanics is important to me, and I enjoy quests with beautiful artwork.  It's hard to put them in exact order, but I'd say some of my favorites would be:

 

1. A Knife in the Dark

2. Fog on the Barrow Downs

3. The Weather Hills

4. A Shadow of the Past

5. The Watcher in the Water

6. The Three Trials

7. Celebrimbor's Secret

8. Escape from Mount Gram

9. The Old Forest

10. Murder at the Prancing Pony

11. The Massing at Osgiliath

12. The Ruins of Belegost (though I haven't gotten to beat this one yet actually, I like the theme)

There's nothing less fun than a quest that can wipe you on the first turn due to bad drawing, so I don't think I can name ten that I actually like.

Having just gotten my copy of Belegost, I need to amend my list and put it on there.

> There's nothing less fun than a quest that can wipe you on the first turn due to bad drawing, so I don't think I can name ten that I actually like.

Every quest does that. For example:

PtM: Draw Ungoliant's Spawn, defend with Snowby, Shadow is Hummerhorns, kill Snowby, undefended.

HfG: Old Wifes Tales in Setup.

HoEM: Multiple rockslides.

TDM:Lots of escape tests during setup and nobody's ready to deal with the two hill trolls.

And those are the easy ones.
