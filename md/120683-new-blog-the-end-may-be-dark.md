I have been a Lord of the Rings LCG player since launch, but this is my first post in the FFG forums (I think...). With a massive back-load of quests to work through (41 to be exact), I've started at the beginning and am chronicling my journey at:

 

The End May Be Dark [http://theendmaybedark.blogspot.com]

 

 

Beyond serving as accountability for myself, I hope this will appeal to new players and to players stuck on certain quests.

 

Let me know here any feedback you have on the blog in general and post on the blog any feedback you have about specific quests.

 

Thank you! I'll try to be a bit more involved in this side of the community (and not just BGG) in the future.

 
(put this in the wrong section initially. My apologies!)

Oh! I'm making something similar. But I'm not an expert player, I'm a newbie and I'm writting my post from this point of view. I'm playing, mainly, using 1 core and including the cards available when the adventure pack was available.

I look forward to seeing more! I'm sorta in your boat. I really wish I had time to do this sort of thing.

It's pretty apparent early on that neither am I. But I"m committed to sticking it out and making it work! Most of the knowledge I have on how to play the game is trial and error. Hopefully the blog will help take a little error out for others.

Thank you! Yeah, I'm trying to do it in the evenings after the day is done and a few nights have ended up lasting pretty late. My goal was to get through the Core set before letting others know about the attempt. I'm pretty excited to blaze through more this weekend, but I expect the pace to mellow out a bit as it goes on.

That is my goal as well. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This game is amazing. I don't care if I lose, because I enjoy so much. Now I'm on the second mission (Journey along the Anduin), and this afternoon I'm gonna make my 5th attempt, the second one in easy mode. I think easy mode is a hidden "one play standard mode" for one player with some quests.

Interesting. I'd love to see you not using Glorfindel in every quest... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] You wrote that you don't usually include him, that makes the game more interesting.

I know. I felt like I was setting up a bad standard using him twice in a row in the first three quests. I tried switching with Frodo, but it just didn't work right. And for solo, one-handed Dol Guldur, beggars can't be choosers. Can't say I won't bring him out on a future quest where low threat and high power is needed, but I'll try to set him aside for a while.
