# [Helm&#039;s Deep Quest 1/2 Resolution](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175990-helms-deep-quest-12-resolution/)

1B states to advance to 2A at the end of the round

 

So, at the end of the round, 2A resolves

- Deeping Wall becomes active

- 1 to 4 copies of Soldier of Isengard are added to the staging area

- 1 to 4 cards are revealed

 

Then we advance to stage 2B

 

"Forced: at the end of the round place 1 progress here for each enemy in the staging area..."

 

So, before the end of the first round I need to place progress on 2B? That seems extreme and not the intent of the quest. 

 

What's the ruling on this? How are multiple "end of round" effects triggered? Has the end of the round passed by the time we get to stage 2B?

I wouldn't (and haven't been) resolving the 2B forced effect as soon as it is revealed.  If you are in a 4 player game, there's a decent chance you'll have as many as 8 enemies up there after you reveal cards, so wham-- advance right to stage 3.  

 

I can't think of a comparable example off the top of my head.  We do know that it IS possible to trigger a Response on a card that was not in your hand when its trigger went off (kill an enemy, use Foe-hammer, draw a Foe-hammer and you can use that new copy as long as you have a weapon to exhaust).  So that's a strike against-- 2B was out of play when the 'trigger' went off ("end of round"), but using the Foe-hammer logic you should trigger that Forced response anyway, as the game has not progressed.  

 

But as you say, that does not seem to be the intent.  Intent is the one thing that beats 'rules as written,' as the intent will catch up sooner or later with an official ruling or an errata... so may as well play it correctly now.

 

Or then maybe there is a comparable example and the effect shouldn't trigger, anyway.  Maybe someone else can think of one?

I'm pretty sure I saw an errata from a caleb answer... didn't bother adding it to my faq, but now I regret it...

He responded to a question about the stage 3 effect ('if you did not place 1 progress token here after questing successfully, reveal one card).  Maybe that's what you're thinking of?

No...

maybe? 

I'm pretty sure it was about the progress token put after changing quest...

I'm sure, at least, that I have a bad memory though.

Caleb:,,No. You should not trigger the end of round Forced effect on stage 2B unless you began the round at stage 2B."

i didn't place tokens by one reason: if there is 2 'at the end of the round' text cards, you can chose which trigger first (like unique locations with 2b, 3b or 4b in Battle-5-armies). Even when you have discarded 1b and put into game 2a and 2b.
