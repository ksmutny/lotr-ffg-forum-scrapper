Hi there,

 

played The Antlered Crown yesterday and Old Hatreds was attached to the quest card:

 

> When Revealed: Attach to the current quest. (Counts as a Condition attachment with the text: "Forced: After a player draws any number of cards, raise his threat by 1.")
> 
>  

 

So .. do we have to raise our threat if all time counters where removed from the raven war-camp?

 

> Time 3. Forced: After the last time counter is removed from this location, starting with the first player, each player draws the top card of the Raven deck and puts it into play engaged with him.

 

I think yes .. and additional trigger all other effects that will trigger by drawing any number of cards.

I always thought of "drawing cards" to be in reference to drawing cards from a player deck, however, I'm not so sure anymore.  You bring up a really good point.  It seems very odd to me that the developers chose the word "draws" on Raven War-camp if they did not intend for this to trigger "draw" effects.  It seems very deliberate.  They easily could have used the terminology "adds" which has been used countless times as a way to avoid "When Revealed" effects and would also avoid "draw" effects.

 

I think the best way to proceed, without clarification from the developers, is to assume that drawing the top card of the Raven deck would indeed trigger effects such as Old Hatreds.

The When Revealed effect of Ill Tidings says "The first player draws this card into his hand" so there is another example of an unusual draw. I'm pretty sure that Ill Tidings triggers Old Hatreds and the like. Given that, I guess the effect in question might indeed count as drawing a card, although it is very weird.
