 Has FFG made a PDF available of the insert for the Redhorn gate pack? I'd like to see how exactly they officially worded Secrecy.

 

[ADMIN: The rules for Secrecy are in The Redhorn Gate rulesheet [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/rulesheets/The-Redhorn-Gate-rulesheet.pdf] (pdf, 1.0 MB), also currently available on The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game Support Page [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4].]

not last time i looked- if you want to check go to the general LOTR LCG page and then support- it will be there if it is

It's not on the website yet, but I just read the rulesheet last night. I can post the exact text when I get home, but for now here's how it works:

If your threat is 20 or less you can play the card for it's cost minus the secrecy.

So for example, 'Timely Aid' is cost 4, secrecy 3, so it will play for 1 resource if your threat is 20 or less.

The only other rule for it is that you can ONLY get the secrecy discount when playing the card FROM HAND.

Hope that helps.

im really pleased with secrecy- theyve managed to make a rule and keyword that for once doesnt raise a thousand questions about how to play it

Ok, exact text from the flyer insert for official-ness:

"Secrecy X" Keyword

Secrecy is a new keyword introduced on player cards in the Dwarrowdelf Cycle. Secrecy lowers the cost to play the card by the specified value, provided the threat of the player who is playing the card is 20 or below. Secrecy only applies when the card is played from hand, and never modifies the printed cost of the card.
