Is LOTR Digital available to play on Steam right now?

It's not yet playable, but it does show up in Steam.  I would recommend adding it to your Wishlist, so hopefully you'll get notified when it's available.

Thank you.  I really don't want to see the paper game forum over run with digital discussions.
