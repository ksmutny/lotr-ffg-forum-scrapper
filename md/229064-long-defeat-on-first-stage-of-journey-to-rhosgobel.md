If players manage to nuke the Rhosgobel itself, and put Long Defeat on the fists stage, will response trigger before second stage is in effect, so using its effect to heal Wilyador will not make Long Defeat discarded from play? Or it get discarded?

Then Radagast is dead, and since the players were probably within the blast radius, so are they. Game over.

 

But I know what you meant  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] , so let's actually answer your question.

 

> ... and put Long Defeat on the fists stage, will response trigger before second stage is in effect, so using its effect to heal Wilyador will not make Long Defeat discarded from play? Or it get discarded?

 
When you fulfill a quest card's conditions (usually by placing enough progress on it, and sometimes by accomplishing other tasks as well), you progress immediately to the next stage of the quest. Any "After" effects, like Long Defeat ("After attached quest card is defeated ...") will resolve once you've finished setting out the new card (and fulfilling its "When Revealed" effect, if any).
 
Therefore, if you use The Long Defeat's ability to heal Wilyador, it will be removed from the game (not just discarded) because by the time it triggers, stage 2's effect is in play. It's still a good idea, though -- five points of healing is like getting a free Athelas.

Is see. That is what confused me - "immediate" change of stage vs response triggering "immediately after" the event occurs.

It all follows from the idea that events triggered by the game always occur before any player triggered events.

But Rhosgobel prevents that.

Yeah, he mentioned he would be exploring Rhosgobel before proceeding to stage 2 (Asfaloth etc).

It feels like a bully tho, to pick Rhosgobel. Every other quest location nowdays have the cheap "immune to player card effects".
