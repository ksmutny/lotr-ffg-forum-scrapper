So they're resurrecting Valour as well? That's pretty cool, but it seems to me we're gonna see ships again before we see another Doomed keyword.

 

Pack looks pretty good though. Dat art on Legacy Weapon.

Open the Armory is a very welcome addition to the card pool. Its about time we had such a card.

That's true, it's gonna be fun for some decks just fetching and playing that Citadel Plate for free.

If it cost 0 there would be no decision whether to play it or not.

So what? Eagles Are Coming/Entmoot cost 0. 1 to fetch a weapon seems "nah".

Entmoot should cost 1 honestly. 2 if it were neutral. I routinely draw 3+ cards with it. Eagles are Coming should probably cost 1 as well, but is probably underpriced for two reasons: tactics sphere and more limited number of eagles. 

 

The number of decision-less cards in this game should be kept to a minimum in my opinion.

1 to fetch a weapon is not "nah" if you are a tactics deck that relies on Foe-hammer for card draw, or a direct damage deck that relies on Ranger bows.

This.

Top freaking 10 cards. It's a great addition to the pool.

 

 

Also, I really want to like that legacy blade, but I think it will not make it into many decks as it just seems too slow to build up.

Still nah in my book. In the world where stuff like Eagles Are Coming, Entmoot and most importantly, Daeron's Runes exist, to fetch a weapon for 1 resource is a nah. It's, most of all, a deck space investment, and it's good if you'll need it when you draw it, but let's assume you draw it when you got your weapons covered, or you need your resources for something more immediate - it's a dead draw. And LotR is too harsh of a game. Still, just my opinion. But hey, I'm not seeing Muster the Rohirrim getting that much spotlight.

I'd say that in the right deck, finding a weapon or armour can make somewhat more difference than finding a Rohan ally.

Also, Mustering doesn't have the Valour option.

That's no argument, as the same goes for Entmoot & Eagles are coming: you don't need it when you got the cards already covered.

Yet all are still a possible deck thinner. At least they replace themselves when you can grab something.

Also IMO, one neutral resource is far easier to cough up than one resource of a particular sphere. Unless you are playing monosphere or have absolutely perfect resource smoothing (both uncommon).

Search events, ringsdb popularity:

 

1+ cost:

241 decks, Heed the Dream (1 cost for 1 of top 5 cards, +3 leadership for any card in deck)

90 decks, Word of Command (1 cost + Istari exhaustion for any card in deck)

71 decks, Mustering the Rohirrim (1 cost for 1 Rohan ally in top 10 cards)

39 decks, Gandalf's Search (X cost for 1 of top X cards)

18 decks, Dunedain Message (1 cost for any side quest in deck)

 

0 cost:

152 decks, Entmoot (0 cost + active Ent for all Ent cards in top 5)

136 decks, Eagles are Coming (0 cost for all Eagles cards in top 5)

116 decks, Tree People (0 cost + silvan to hand for Silvan ally into play from top 5)

78 decks, The Seeing-Stone (0 cost + 1 doomed for a doomed card in deck)

18 decks, Hope Rekindled (0 cost+ Valour to find 1 valour of top 10)

 

Mustering the Rohirrim is clearly a far less popular card than Entmoot or Eagles are Coming, and it's not because Rohan decks are less popular.  However, despite this cards' similarity with Mustering, I think we will be much more popular, since I think it's quite common to be looking for a particular weapon or armor instead of a particular Rohan ally.  The need for a specific attachment is such that I think it may be more valuable at 1-cost for a 10 card search than at 0-cost for one of the top 5.  Still, I don't agree that 0-cost events should be avoided as "decisionless cards", the decision is whether to use it in your deck, and most 0-card events just aren't strong enough to justify that.

 

Still, I think the card would be more interesting if it cost 0 + exhaust a tactics character.

Nope. You put attachments on heroes, you outfitted your heroes - you're good to go. You can't overattach because of restrictions. There is no limit of how much allies you can put on the board.

There are enough deck ideas that really need to draw a weapon early, so I expect this card to be very playable.

I never said that 0-cost = decisionless. A card like Tree People involves multiple decisions, both in who you pick up and which of the top 5 you put into play.

 

But certain 0-cost cards like Entmoot and Eagles are Coming are practically decisionless. Yes you can decide not to include it in your deck, but even then with some math you can remove that decision. If at least 1 in 5 cards in your deck are Ent cards, then the expected number of cards you will get from Entmoot is >=1, and it becomes a no-brainer to include because at worst it's a deck-thinner. Any less than 1 in 5 and you will whiff more than you succeed and it's probably not worth including, although I'm sure there are decks that are just looking for a specific card like Treebeard or Landroval and are ok with paying the cost of whiffing.

 

Anyway, in my opinion deckbuilding is not where the decisions around a card should end. There shouldn't be cards in the game where when you draw them, you always play them, regardless of the circumstances.

Unless you have Treebeard hero, Entmoot isn't as straightforward as The Eagles are Coming.  You may be unable to play it when drawn, so even with 10 other Ent cards in the deck it's not at worst a deck-thinner.  At worst it's a dead card.  Eagles are Coming is rarely a dead card (only if all the Eagles have been drawn already), but I don't grant that it's "at worst a deck-thinner" because the return isn't guaranteed.  Daeron's Runes and (dwarf-free) We Are Not Idle are deck thinners.  EAC can fetch you 0 cards or 5 cards.  Even if the expected return is >1, the probability of whiffing is still significant.

 

Of course, I think it's justifiable to include even if the expected return is < 1, as long as Eagles are more important than the average card to my strategy.  Even when EAC whiffs, it has the beneficial side effect of reshuffling the deck if an Eagle would not have been within the next five cards.

 

I'll grant that if you can play it there's no reason not to play it outside some edge cases.  That's largely true of Daeron's Runes as well, though that does give you an actual decision to make on the discard.  However, while it's exceptional to have a card that is effectively always played when drawn for every deck it is in, it's not rare at all for a particular deck to have a card that is effectively always played when drawn, given that particular deck's strategy, and the choices made when playing it are made when constructing the deck rather than playing it.  Free or effectively-free attachments generally get played when drawn and I usually know exactly who they will go on before they are ever drawn.  That's even true of some cost-1 cards -- there's generally not any on-the-fly decision making involved in putting Light of Valinor on SpGlorfindel or Gondorian Shield on TaBoromir.  That decision was made when the deck was assembled.

 

Cards that require decision making are more interesting to play, but I have no problem with cards that auto-play as long as they aren't also auto-include or utterly useless.  If Eagles are Coming represent essentially a passive boost to Eagles deck -- well, it's not that strong a tribe and needs the help.  Providing an essentially passive boost from an auto-playing player card doesn't seem any different in principle to me than providing a passive boost to an archtype by including a particular hero.

> Btw... Is there a Cirith Gurat in the lore?

Nope. There is the Eastern Guard which is meant to be a big fortress guarding the Eastern side of Mordor. It's also probably the main entry point into Mordor for the Easterlings, Haradrim and Variags of Khand. 

I assume Cirith Gurat is just an official name FFG created for the Eastern Guard or is perhaps a similar castle/tower that serves a similar purpose but is more South East than East and closer to Harad than anything else.

It's certainly not amazing, but I could definitely see myself putting Open the Armory into my high threat Gandalf/Gimli deck that wants to find Citadel Plates. Or it could find Gondorian Shield, Raven Winged Helm, or Citadel Spear for Tactics Beregond. I'm just glad that valour will continue to receive support. 

 

Legacy Blade, like all the other side quest dependent cards, seems lackluster at the moment. But the age of Thurindir is near, and this cycle should be brimming with encounter side quests. I still would have preferred if Legacy Blade gained attack power whenever the wielder killed an enemy while attacking alone, but that would probably be too strong (and make Keeping Count seem even more ridiculous).

The reason I talked about expected value is because I know those cards can whiff even with half of your deck being Ents/Eagles. But in the long run you'll be getting >=1 ally per use of the card, and in the long run your deck will be more consistent with the card than without it. It's a "statistical" deck-thinner. But I think we can both agree that in Ent/Eagle heavy decks, Entmoot/EaC are both auto-include and auto-play. For these few cards, it's the game playing the game. They aren't so much cards, but gameplay instructions.

 

You are right that it can be considered a passive boost to an archetype akin to including a particular hero. The reason I find that to be a problem is because it's kind of like how you can "choose" to build a Dwarf deck without Dain - it just can't be near as good. Too much of this kind of thing makes for boring deckbuilding because it takes away decisions. I have nothing against global buffs, especially if it's a weaker trait like eagles that needs it. But there are plenty of ways to buff an archetype in a non-automatic way.

 

Now you may be perfectly fine with your 47 decisions when making and Ent deck. Some people may want even more auto-includes so they only need to decide on 40 cards. I can't argue with that. It's just that I personally find deckbuilding more interesting and creative when there are 50 choices to make.

 

As for 1-cost cards, they are always a decision to play because resources are limited. Sure, LoV on Glorfindel is an obvious play, but I've held off on it before because I wanted to save a resource for Test of Will. For free attachments, you still have to decide who to put them on. And even if the choice is obvious they typically have Responses or Actions on them that you need to decide to trigger throughout the game. One might think that a free attachment like Love of Tales is automatic, but I can say though experience with that card that it introduces frequent decisions into the gameplay.

The spoiler article for Race Across Harad [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/8/26/race-across-harad/] said we were getting more support for the Doomed keyword, so it seems like they're resurrecting everything this cycle.

 

Open the Armory is going straight into my brothers deck [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/3834/warriors-of-the-west-3.0]; that deck just doesn't work unless I draw Elven Mail! Plus, it will help to keep those Foe-Hammers from becoming dead cards (which seems to happen way more often than it should, somehow).

they did confirm Doomed would be in this cycle (i believe in the 2nd or 3rd pack, but i'm too lazy to read the preview articles again)

if it's in the first pack, it's not available in my country, so my bad

EDIT: darn you @Authraw ninja'd before i could get to the end of the thread. that'll teach me to just read a few posts and then start replying :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

also yes that weapon art is nice. i also really like it a lot. at 1 side quest, it's +1 attack for 0 cost, which is actually pretty huge. in a multiplayer game, even without the new hero who starts the game with a sidequest, you're guaranteed to get one pretty early.

i think it's probably a trap to try to go for 3 sidequests for the full bonus since it'd probably distract too much from the main quest, but in The Lost Realm / Angmar Awakened quests that have a liberal use of side quests, this thing is really great too

it's also interesting how they work differently mechanically

Entmoot and Eagles are Coming each look at 5 cards for 0 cost but put every available hit into your hand

Mustering of the Rohirrim, on the other hand, looks at twice as many cards, costs one more, but only nets you 1 card of any possible hit

if the costs were the same, it'd be easier to gauge how and why players seem to gravitate towards one over the other, but looking at many cards for the one you need right now versus less cards and just take all that you can find is an interesting choice.

i also think i'd probably say that, as someone who plays Rohan decks a lot, i ended up not ever really feeling like i needed to ever find one particular Rohan ally of all the various ones i have access to. so many fill the same sorts of roles, and i find that i pull them quickly enough.

i know not all of that's relevant to the current discussion, but bringing it back around, i agree with seastan about a Tactics deck relying on Foe-hammer (with say, hero Hama). it's really strong for enabling your deck's core strategy if they rely on weapons/armour. also could be great for getting a Citadel Plate onto your tactic Gimli or hero Gloin or something. or Mirkwood Long-knife on your spirit Legolas, or hey, that new Legacy Blade in your mono-Lore side quest deck with that new hero who starts the game with Gather Information (which you use to find your next side quest)

i would say 1 resource to draw a card is just an ok to below-average deal, but being able to additionally search 10 cards for the right card you need (again, if you need weapon/armour for your deck's strategy), it's pretty good. and the valour action of letting you additionally play it for free and in any phase (granted, searching less cards) is pretty good

Valour cards also can work pretty well with Doomed cards. Especially if you can fire a bunch of them off right before you do your threat reset with Loreagorn.

I just finished a play-through of Weather Hills in which I used Power of Orthanc to clear Cold from Angmar. Also got me up to 40 threat, so I played Hour of Wrath and Horn's Cry. All enemies -3 attack, and my heroes don't exhaust to attack or defend. Mablung + Gondorian Shield just shrugged off everything, and then Legolas + 2x Rivendell Blade killed all the enemies and placed 6 progress.

i've also become a huge fan of tBoromir lately

i had run a mono-Tactics tank deck with big beefy defenders and engagement effects and a few high-power attackers, revolving around Beregond, Hama, and Mablung

that's evolved into a Gondor-themed Leadership/Tactics full-on valour deck with Boromir at the centre (along with L-Denethor and Mablung) and pretty much every valour or 40+ threat card

what i love about it a lot is how it doesn't screw over other players or decks with all the extra threat (except things like Dunhere)

Yikes, I didn't realize it had been that long. This was supposed to be out Q1 this year, and the end of Q3 is fast approaching.

I've heard that the other LCGs are experiencing similar delays; does anyone play any of the others? How are their communities reacting to the delays?

Remember that Crossing of Poros was mistakenly shipped, then recalled.  Any "delays" are purely due to FFG choosing to do so.

This really feels like "Zombie LOTR LCG" now. Sure, it's not dead, maybe it's not dying, but it feels like in a similar state as current Simpsons compared to the early seasons. Lack of interest from FFG themselves for the game really is showing.

FFG never show many interest. Almost no organized play, adventure were delay even at this time. I don't think it mean the game is dying. It is most about the comfort of FFG about his monopole on the field of deck building game in a cooperative environment.

An interesting way to look at it - and it may be right - but I think the answer is simply that they have limited resources and have so many products that are new and need art etc... LOTR has just shuffled to the bottom of the deck.  Star Wars is a hot commodity, but the license won't last forever.  L5R is new.  Thrones interest may drop after the next TV season ends.  Magali left to make bank with Wizards.  You get the picture.

@Bullroarer Took [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/171578-bullroarer-took/] also Runewars minis seem to be like one of the biggest priorities in the FFG newsfeed. I would never have guessed,

While I do understand and ultimately accept the reason LOTR LCG hasn't featured often in FFG related... well, everything, lately, I still wish they did just a little bit more of advertising work for it.

Of course there is no reason to delay products that are hit unless they are others priorities ;). It is not a great idea since they have one of the best games (not only on my opinion, also a top100 on BGG) and they probably can make way more money on it by giving it more support. I still think they will continue to print new stuff for a long time because they sell a lot (of new and old materials).

Even though, news from 5th AP, more Nightmare Decks, GenCon adventure (maybe too early), Fellowship Event (this year we had no news and are in September), new Deluxe or even Second Breakfast news with some designer made decks...

I don't know, for me I see plenty of potential content to be put on news.

It's pretty crazy how the last AP came out 3 months ago and since this one is "On the Boat" still, we likely aren't getting it for another 3 weeks at least. I know we just got Mountain of Fire, but I really hope 4+ months between APs is not a new standard.

I was going to post that it hasn't been three months since The Black Serpent... until I checked.  I guess they want to have something to sell at Xmas time?  I'm sure with Matt moving to Arkham and Caleb finishing up the sagas he needs a break.  (But I don't have to like it!)

I suspect it could be more a manifacture issue than a design issue. Probably the high demand for Arkham reprints, the launch of L5R and the erroneous shipping of the 6th pack containing a major erratum took its toll on the release schedule.

Originally scheduled to be a Q1 2017 release, and we're now in Q4. Ouch.

And didn't Crossing of Poros accidentally get shipped to some retailers in Europe (instead of the Black Serpent) several months back, which suggests that all of these APs have been printed for quite some time now?

That is correct. They are developed and printed all at once.  While I'm sure there is a reason for the hold, production and shipping delays aren't it.

As a punishment against those who leaked it? Don't know that punishing the rest of the customers who had nothing to do with this is a particularly wise course of action. 

But perhaps they're just prepping us for a much slower release schedule going forward.

Does anyone know if Caleb is working on other games, like Matt is on the Arkham Horror LCG?

Not as a punishment but because they have to be replaced for the bug.

By the way the ones who make the leak have the pack so it can't be punished this way

I'm convinced this is all about Quickbeam.  They wanted to fix the miss print which has cause a big delay for the final pack.  If they continued with the old release schedule there would have been like an 8 month gap between 5 and 6.  So they delayed 4 and now 5 to speed things out.  I don't think they have run out of design ideas, and may even have a plan for something to replace the saga releases.  I just wish they would come out and say there was a manufacturing error so we can stop doubting the future of the game.

That's the big piece for me. Sean from COTR has said numerous times how he wished there was a betterment in communication from FFG and that they would at least address the delays so as to not leave us in the dark. Well, that upcoming Caleb interview is the perfect time for that, right?

It seems like an awful lot of work to reprint an AP for what I would consider a minor error, although I guess there were also 2 locations in the preview that used the same art, so maybe they decided there were enough issues to warrant it. I'm really curious to see if this next pack has any more Harad archetype player cards since this is likely the last opportunity we'll see any, and I have been having fun building a deck that uses the existing ones.

Seeing what FFG has been up to with it's other older properties I feel like anything could happen with this humble game, and after these delays I won't be too surprised if this game is about to end completely, be reborn with a 2.0 version, or just slowly carry on as usual with a new cycle announcement.

Dungeons of Cirith Gurat are on the Boat, and Crossings of Poros are at the Printer. Have a look at the 'Upcoming' tab at the top of the page if you want/need an explanation of what that means. Hope that helps!

No one knows for sure why the 5th pack is so late.  The *6th* pack was accidentally released months ago outside the US, and had a typo on its hero.  It also hints strongly that the next cycle will be in the vicinity of Dale, so there's no reason to suppose that the LOTR LCG is "over" -- and even if this were the last cycle, that'd be a terrible reason to sit on the 5th pack for many months.

That the game would end before the 5th pack is released is completely implausible.  Aside from the 6th pack being spoiled, we've previously been told the entire cycle is developed at once, and they've already spoiled two cards from the pack (Legacy Blade and Open the Armory).

This is probably the longest the game has been delayed mid cycle, and probably the longest by far the game has gone without announcing what the next cycle is going to be, so there is no telling. Allegedly there is some big announcement coming out about the game next month, so maybe that will shed some light.

Some of the Ring Maker packs and other stuff from LotR  LCG on the Upcoming page have been on the boat since December of 2016 even though stores have/had it. So I would put very little faith in the accuracy of stuff on the page.

Take this info with a grain of salt, but in the Spanish web of FFG it says that the fifth AP will be released 8th December.

It could be another product to fill the space of the deluxe, thing that happens outside the cycle. It could be idea about organized play (either new specific content, rules to replace face the shadow or something totally different).

But I'm pretty confident that is about the next cycle.

There are two Merries and two Pippins, but only one each of Frodo, Sam, and Bilbo.  Since it's a Lore hero that rules out Bilbo, and Frodo is a more thematic fit for Lore than Sam (Sam would make a fine spirit hero, though).

Of course, it could be a FFG creation.  Or a more obscure hobbit.  Since we already have a Grima hero in Lore, why not Lobelia Sackville-Baggins?

For me, the unsourced rumor in banania's post.  Good enough to speculate on, given that FFG hasn't seen fit to given any new information about this pack since last January.

It'd ruin my naming scheme.  I can distinguish between LoPippin and SpPippin easily enough, but two different LoBilbo?  I suppose the threat would be different, so they could just be Bilbo9 and Bilbo6.

I don't either, but I can dream.  If it's a new Hobbit, it's probably an invented female Bree Hobbit.  Not that it wouldn't be cool, but it wouldn't be Smeagol-cool.  Or even Lobelia.

Think of it -- Bilbo not only voluntarily approached three trolls around a fire, he attempted to pick one of their pockets.  Bilbo hung around an Elven King for weeks, stealing his stuff.  Bilbo went down a tunnel not once, but three times when he knew there may be a live dragon at the end of it.  Bilbo betrayed Thorin Oakenshield, then voluntarily went back and put himself in his power.  And he had the strength of will to voluntarily give The One Ring away after bearing it for many decades.  Clearly, here is a Hobbit of exceptional courage and strength of will, not just by Hobbit standards but by *anybody's standards*.

And this same Hobbit *hid* from Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.  Now that's a force to be reckoned with.

Gandalf feared her too.

Apparently we finally know about the long-awaited hero for this pack!

Straight up from the French forum the Belgium early release rumours sprang from:

"

Foulque Bophin connaissance 7 de menace.

2 PV

On reduit sa menace de 1 par héros hobbit que vous contrôlez. (C'est le même type de capa au setup que Mirlonde).

Action : Defausser Foulque Bophin pour réduire votre menace de 7.

Ability would read: Reduce your starting threat by 1 for each hobbit hero you control, Action: discard Folco Bofin to reduce your threat by 7.

Interesting.  Bilbo can finally be included in an all-Hobbit secrecy deck.

Houses of Healing becomes 7 threat reduced for 5 cost, without the Healer discount.

That will make hobbit secrecy decks much stronger. He has 4 (3 with fellowship Frodo) starting threat, and can discard himself to get back to secrecy. With hobbits you can play 2-hero deck and just discard him immediately. But outside of hobbit secrecy I don’t think he’ll have some uses

This one is very interesting to me. I'm usually stuck when I want to play with multiple secrecy since Pippin is the only lore hero I'm interested with. Now this one bring a whole new world, with secrecy with two 8 threat hero (yes Tom and Sam, I'm thinking of you).

Basically all decks that previously had two heroes, can toss this new hero for "free", gaining an extra resource the first turn and then reducing your starting threat by 1 when you sacrifice him.

Also, so far I'm not seeing the "once per game" restriction, so with some Fortune or Fates you can reduce your threat by two digits "easily". We have to recognize that The Galadhrim's Greeting is more efficient though

Let's see if those Belgium forums could show us some pics of the players cards (hoping for encounter cards too!).

I'm thinking on a lineup with Sam Gamgee, Tom Cotton and Folco "Mirloffin". Good questing power, good combat shenanigans (Staff of Lebethron, Hobbit-sense, Halfling Determination, Tom's response and passive). Still, I think that hobbits need a bit more "oomph" with stronger hobbit allies. Or maybe they're intended to be paired with stronger races.

They have some of the most hilarious tricks IMO (I love Small Target) which I'd love to put inside a deck that is functional and capable against hard quest (NM or not).

I already ask for scans of the allies.

About fight abilities staff, feint and hobbit cloack seem to be enough. Without Tom it would be hard to kill enemies with hobbit. I usually play also secrecy cards (in this case ithilien lookout) who are able to do that.

I ask for all the cards, texte of the allies, scan of anything related. I would not push it harder, if they are afraid of trouble that can happen to them (or to the store who give the pack) I will respect that. I will also have to wait to have my many copies for test many hobbit secrecy builds.

These people are so conservative! The scans for Crossings of Poros were leaked months ago and nobody was negatively affected that I know of. On the other hand, FFG has kept us with blue balls for way more than enough without any word on the pack or even the game, save for restrictive errata, and people still want to defend them! Literally sheep defending the tyrant...

I'm not happy with (some of) the errata, the long delay on the next pack, the lack of information on *why* the next pack is delayed, or the lack of any information at all about future products since the Crossings of Poros was leaked.

However, I don't see what I can possibly do to influence FFG to behave differently.  Threatening to quit the game is an idle threat for me, not least because my main complaint is lack of new things to buy.

Cards in the next pack:

- "Wall of Shields". A tactics event which reads: "action: enemies can't attack players until the end of the round"

- "Tauriel". A spirit ally that reads: "Response: when this ally enters play, return a hero from the discard pile to play"

 

IF THIS IS NOT THE CASE, THEN WHY THE DELAY AND THE ERRATAS ???

I mean, I think the release of 2 new lcg's the last two years has a lot to do, as well as the Asmodee merger (they probably looked at the current lcg lineup, decided to focus on a few and "retire" other less popular ones like SW and LOTR to having less product/advertisements/articles, etc). But even though that's probably the case, it's really frustrating that FFG has kept complete silence over a game that was a few years ago one of their top selling games relegated to a secondary place without a word.

I just received the FFG Winter 2017 Catalog and the LotR LCG got its own 2 page advertisement, similar to their other newer products. There was a picture of the new Netrunner core set in there, but it was shown on the last page grouped together with a lot of older games.

How the heck does Folco Boffin, of all characters, have 2 attack?! Especially given poor Bilbo, apparently forever stuck at 1 attack and 1 willpower... There's no justice in the world.

Well it's still "on the boat" today.  So I really doubt I will see this by Fellowship night.  I had so hoped for Open the Armory.  Alas.

Well, you have to take into consideration that Bilbo is 88 years older than Folco.

Well, that's all very true.  But Bilbo still *hid* from the fearsome Lobelia Sackville-Baggins.

And Folco is Lobelia's cousin.  (Third cousin, from his POV).  Don't underestimate the Boffin blood.

In all seriousness, Bilbo *does* deserve better.  But letting Bilbo be overpriced with a less useful stat distribution is probably a better option than making all the later Hobbits even worse.

I've been wondering what a new, good Bilbo should look like.  Besides his obvious Lore, Bilbo demonstrated ample Leadership, Spirit, and Tactics in the pages of the Hobbit.  Yes, tactics -- Bilbo slew dwarf-sized spiders *with a single thrown rock*.  Bullroarer himself couldn't do better.  I'd love to see Bilbo with a cool combat ability, but with his pathetic 1 att/2 def it'd have to be really cool.  Maybe Leadership would be better, since there's a shortage of leadership Hobbits.

Still, there's precedent for mucking with the Hobbit stat lines, as Merry has a different printed stat line (OK, it's effectively the same if he's the only Hobbit).  Further, the saga Bilbo has a different stat line, a 1/1/1/3 -- OK, still a terrible stat line.  I think Bilbo is the only character whose ally version has higher willpower, without being temporary.

Gandalf is temporary, even the OHUH version will go away eventually.  Denethor's willpower depends on the number of healthy heroes, but it can be greater and can't be less, so he works.  Beorn works -- has more defense than his heroic counterpoint, too.  I think that's probably the complete list.

Theodred with Diligent Noble and Heir of Mardil quests without exhausting. Overall, any hero can do this if paired with Theodred

EDIT: Theodred is already a noble, but he can still ready other questing heroes with Diligent Noble+Heir of Mardil. 

 

Mablung would also benefit greatly from the same "combo"

I wonder which hero(es) would benefit the most from gaining the Noble trait, considering that noble heroes can get the Palantir

haha, forgot Theodred was already a noble. He can still ready other non-noble questing heroes if they can get Diligent noble + Heir of Mardil attached. Maybe it's too complicated to try to pull off; at least, Theodred, Diligent noble and Heir of Mardil are all leadership cards, and the attachments are not restricted

4/2/2/3 is great, but if you keep your Ents healthy, it's 0/2/2/3, in which case just play a Tactics Ent. It anti-synergizes with the Wellinghall Preserver, too. Now mind you I don't think it's mediocre. I think he's quite good but does have an interesting restriction that needs to be built around.

Booming Ent already work with damage ent. I usually heal both of Dearlingue (or something like this) Warrior and Treebeard because they are my boys for blocking but all the others ents are better with 1 damage on them.

Well, it costs 3 and is 0/2/2/3. For it to be 4/2/2/3 you need to have 4 damaged ents. Until that moment, playing a Wellinghall preserver is always better, same cost and is 3/2/2/3 plus they heal. At early turns a Wandering ent is better for two resources.

The moment you have 4 damaged ent on the table, yes, then it has 4 willpower, but still it is only marginally better than a wellinghall preserver, and it does not heal or it has no special ability like the other unique ents.

Anyway, no need to discuss this.

Wellinghall preservers are great, but you can only have three in a deck.  I can see this ent working great in a red/green ent deck or fellowship, where you routinely leave ents a little injured, but it's not going to be useful with just green ents.

My reaction to the previously-unspoiled non-heroes:

Knight of Dale is interesting, while 4 cost is hefty, getting 2-wp and 2-attack isn't bad once you get in Valour territory.  The overall numbers aren't far off Gimli territory.  But the most interesting thing is a Dale-affiliated ally when the next cycle is going to be in that area.  Will there be a "Dale deck" possible in the next cycle, and if so what mechanically would tie them together?  The three Dale allies already released are all scouts with some sort of location connection; but this card has none of that.

Knight of Riddermark is a nice complement to Escort of Edoras, and should work well in a Rohan deck.  For a generic Tactics deck I don't know that it's better than Vassal of the Windlord (1 less attack, but also 1 less cost and ranged), and that's not good enough to make into non-Eagles decks.  Vassal is also better for battle questing.

Survivor of Eregion is great for running on empty at 2/2/2 for 2 resources.  I like Silver Harp in my Noldor decks, so not so great for me.

Leaflock has been discussed already.  I don't think he's useless if you're playing with Booming Ents and thus intentionally keep Ents a little injured, but it's disappointing he can't self-damage.

Diligent Noble was expected.  I love Noble trait for Heir of Mardil, and since this is Leadership like Heir and Steward, I can see a use for it.

Tough Defense is a nice, if expensive card, though its non-unique restriction means that Swift Strike will be better for most bosses.

Heir of Elendil requires a relatively common combo (Noldor/Dunedain), but for lower player counts will be of interest only to quests with a few especially obnoxious locations.  For 3-4 player I can see this being useful in any quest.

To me the awesome card in this pack will be Heir of Earendil. It is the test of will of location. You remove it before counting the quest. It is a great use of threat? I think I will play it a lot, and not only with 3+ players.

Agree.  It's pretty bonkers.  Requires the right deck, but otherwise...

It's a powerful effect, but if you can generally travel to and clear locations as they come out (very common in 1-2 players), the ability isn't too much stronger than Fatty Bolger's, trading threat for staging.

With Test of Will, I often hold it in hand for the "When Revealed" I must cancel.  I don't burn it just to avoid a treachery that's annoying.  In a lot of quests, *all* the non-unique locations are mildly annoying in 1-2 players, so packing this card for a cancel doesn't make much sense to me.  But there are certain quests where this card would be the bomb, especially since it doesn't trigger obnoxious "when explored" effects.

A location ask a lot of things:

- First put enough in quest to negate his threat value;

- Then be able to clear the current location to leave a place to it;

- And after that be able to pass it, in order to pass the quest OR be able to travel again.

In a world were it is easy to get some willpower location won't be a problem with few players. But willpower is a real resource and be able not to send many in quest to keep character in quest because you know whatever come you never be stuck with location seem very powerful to me. I'm sad that none of current deck seem to pair a noldor and a dunedain hero but this card have a power level (when you have possibility to play it) similar to test of will.

I'll agree that the timing makes Riddermark better than Edoras, since you don't have to use him before you know you need him.  But in both cases the allies aren't worth much until you trigger their discard.  I like self-discarding allies best when they're useful before they go poof, but for cost-1 (with Theoden) it'll still be handy.

Survivor's 6 points for 2 resources may be a great deal in turns of points/resources, but the marginal value over a 1/1/0/2 ally like Envoy of Pelargir is pretty slim, I think.  Wandering Took isn't used much for a general-purpose spirit ally at 1/1/1/2 outside early progression decks.

Tough Defense's valour effect is great for big-bad-non-uniques like Mumak and assorted Nazgul.  Too bad Host of Angmar is immune to player cards.

Thanks you for pointing that knight effect is a response, not a forced like edoras was. It is way more playable this way.

I've put both the Galadhrim archer and the Westfold Outrider in solo decks before with no intention of triggering their abilities and they've proved useful. When you've only got 1 tactics hero and you are looking to use those resources to play some economically efficient attacking tactics allies, 2 for 2 is the going rate.

The Envoy is cheaper, but also pretty flimsy (she's actually 1/1/0/1), so I see these allies fulfilling different roles. Mono spirit can definitely benefit from having a place to put archery damage for example.

Yeah, I missed that Riddermark's ability was a response instead of forced like Edoras is.  Dang good card, 2 attack for 2 resources, with an option to get an extra 2 attack when you really need it.  I like this better than Galadhon Archer and Westfold Outrider, and I use the Archer a lot.  Now if it were a forced response, it'd be more compelling than Vassal only in Rohan decks.

I'll grant Survivor is the best archery sponge in spirit, the only 2-cost ally with 3+ hp.  Though with mono-spirit there's a lot of 3-cost non-squishy allies that'd be very affordable, and are better for questing or combat (outside Noldor deck).

With mixed spheres, are there better archery sponges available elsewhere at 2-cost?  In Lore and Tactics there are the Ents, Honour Guard, the comparable Erebor Hammersmith and the uncertain benefit of Ithilien Tracker.  But it looks like Leadership only has fellow Noldor Warden of the Havens.  In a non-Noldor deck, I can see Survivor being a good choice in Leadership/Spirit deck against archery quests.

It's fun, but hard. Not the longest quest ever, but with 2 player I think it took us a little over an hour. The first stage can throw a lot of threat your way, and there's a particular enemy that will have attacks flying your way as it's revealed that surges, which is a pain. It wasn't one of those "this card comes up and you lose" type of quests though. Me and my partner had a good time playing it! I especially liked the second stage, it has you sneaking past guards and it really captures that with an interesting mechanic. Great pack all in all, considering the player cards and solid quest!

My wife and I were disappointed in the quest.  We never felt really threatened even when a quest curveball came up halfway through.  There were some mechanism that prevent your progressing that felt more annoying than daunting.  I actually ended up using when revealed cancellation more to stop that than to prevent harm or death to heroes.  Everything made sense story wise, but I still felt let down when we finished.  In the end, I think my disappointment came more from having had waited so long between quests just to have had everything over so quickly.   I actually kinda wish we would have lost a few times so we could have more LotR lcg to look forward to.  Now we probably have another 2 to 3 months to wait for the next one.

Out of curiosity, the front image on the Spanish pack is this [http://www.fantasyflightgames.es/noticias/articulo/las_mazmorras_de_cirith_gurath], different from the USA original.

I'm not at home, but I think its the Mordor orcs, and the one with the tunnle looking icon.  Something like "territory of Harad" or something like that.

Does anyone know what Cirith Gurat means? My best guess from what research I've done is Pass of Death. Presumably Gur comes from Guru (death).
