So i preorder 3 adventure packs from B&N, starting with CatC.  As of yesterday, I have yet to receive my copy of CatC even though it has been out for plenty of time here in the US, but I get an email saying my order has been cancelled.  Then i get an email saying my order for rhosgobel has been cancelled as well.  Pissed off, I cancel the third AP.

I go over to CCG Armory and order CatC & Rhosgobel and they were shipped within an hour and headed towards my house.  Plus, they were on sale for only $9.99 each and shipping for both came to roughly $6.  It was $25 and change for both shipped. 

So just a warning for those who have ordered or may have ordered from Barnes & Noble.  Dont, simply dont.

 Hey Reno451. Sadly, you are correct. I work at B&N in Cary NC, and I tried multiple times to order them as well. We finally started stocking the core set, and about a month after release I was able to shortlist in HFG. The issue I think is one of contract. If I understand the system correctly, B&N has a contract with Fantasy Flight that delays their receiving time at least until the local game stores start stocking the product. (kinda a "support your local game store business first" policy). As to why the company can't seem to get the stuff is beyond me, though, I don't think it is strictly B&N that is to blame for it. I think FF isn't printing enough of the stuff and they are shipping the little they do have to the local stores first. Remember, they have run out of every print every time so far. You are right though, B&N is NOT the place to go for this game. I sympathize with you about the cancelled orders (it happened to me multiple times and I even work there). After all, we are a bookstore, and as far as being a place to find the BOOK you are looking for, we are pretty good at that. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
