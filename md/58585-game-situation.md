 Hello everyone!

Maybe my questions will sound for someone very stupid, but I am new in the card games...

I have such a situation:

I am playing "Journey along the Anduin".

In staging area I have 1 Hill Troll

F_Core_82 [http://lotrlcg.com/img/full/F_Core_82]

In my hand  I have Gandalf - F_Core_73 [http://lotrlcg.com/img/full/F_Core_73] and Sneak Attack F_Core_23 [http://lotrlcg.com/img/full/F_Core_23]. Question: In the end of commiting charecters steap in the Quest phase, can I play "Sneak Attack" on "Gandalf" in my hand. After putting Gandalf in the play, If I am right, I can also deal 4 damage to the Hill Troll, even if hi is in the staging area?

And in the end of the Quest phase according to the Sneak Attack card I put Gandalf back in my hand??? (because it isn't yet end of the round...)

You are correct I think. That is how I play him. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
