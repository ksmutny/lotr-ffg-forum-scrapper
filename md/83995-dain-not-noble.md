# [Dain not noble?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83995-dain-not-noble/)

I was playing some solo dwarfs the other day  and I noticed something strange. Gloin had the noble trait but Dain did not. Did they make an errata about this? Or is Dain not suppose to have the noble trait? If not, its fine, but it really doesn't make much sense thematically. I thought Dain was a king.

Thanks in advance,

Hollow

I'd like to suggest that even at the time they realised Dain was broken, and letting him access to other traits for free was just too much.

Although the noble trait isn't developed very much we've started to see hints of it getting support. Dain is so dominiate in the dwarf theme, he really shouldn't be present in any other theme imo.

Another possiiblity (Although my knowledge of the fluff is a bit hazy) is that Dain might lack the noble trait because he isn't a noble along with the other characters that are… that is, he's a king among dwarves, but the noble trait covers the nobility that actually interact amonst the free peoples. Gloin was an emissary to rivendell (and by extenson all the free peoples).Dain was fairly insular within the loneley mountain I believe. He did work with men to fight in the war of the ring, but wasn't recognised as a diplomat in the way that I feel other noble characters were.

 

What I'm trying to say (in a roundabout way) is that I think the noble trait, covers not all nobles of the free peoples, but a specific subset. That subset being nobles that strongly intereact with other free peoples groups.

I have to disagree on your view about noble being about "interaction with free peoples". Denethor didn't interact with other free peoples.. Imrahill also. 

 

They are noble because of their birth…

 

Also because he was not the rightfull heir of the King of Dwarves title.. He was Thorin's cousin and the line went on Thorin's side of the family… Although i do not dispute that he was a direct descendant from Durin I
