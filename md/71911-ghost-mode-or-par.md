 Hey guys I was looking around various FFG or Board Game forums but I can't quite find what I'm looking for.

Basically the other night I was wondering 'how well' I was doing compared to other players versus various quests. I looked around the LOG but that only compared my scores to friends, not the community as a whole.

What I was hoping to find was an 'official' Fantasy flight 'bar' for more scores especially under the newer scoring rules. 

I understand that the difficulty can vary wildly on certain quests as well as victory points.  but if there was a place that held 'said' scores that I could try and beat. Basically I'm looking for whatever the 'par' for the course may be and see how well I could swing it.
