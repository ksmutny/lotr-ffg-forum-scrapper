Here’s an in-depth look at one of the earlier Saga quests, and is one of a small band that manage to execute a focus on locations and not have the quest fall flat. Vision of the Palantir has published a vast number of articles similar to this on other quests and I feel honoured to the able to contribute to this collection.
