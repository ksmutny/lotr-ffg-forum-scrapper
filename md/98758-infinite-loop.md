# [Infinite Loop?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/)

## 1 [Locksley2 on February 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=978051)

Situation: Three player game, Journey Down the Anduin, Thalin (one of the heroes on the table).

 

Games progresses along, going through the encounter deck and deal with the Eastern Crows as they come up.  Deck gets down to three cards, which are the crows.  Staging portion of the quest begins, first crow hits the table, surge kicks off, then Thalin's response kicks off killing the crow, shuffles back into the deck.  Then we deal with the next crow because of the surge then go through the same sequence. 

 

We didn't know what to do, so we shuffled the discards back into the deck.  My question is, does Thalin's effect take precedence over the surge effect, or is it the other way.  Or, does surge kick off on each crow, then resolve Thalin's response, thus killing all the crows, which are shuffled back into the deck, which would be just those three cards, ending the potential of a loop?

## 2 [booored on February 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=978079)

Thalin's ability destroys the crow before surge can finalize... so they die.. no surge. Also they are not "defeated" in combat.. so they do not get shuffled back into the encounter deck

## 3 [Locksley2 on February 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=978097)

Thanks for the info.

## 4 [alogos on February 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=978678)

What ?

They do get shuffled back into the encounter deck. Their forced effect doesn't need to be proced in "combat". Defeat require to be dealt enought damage, that's what Thalin does. 

From rulebook :

>  
> 
>  
> 
> Any time one of these cards has 0 hit points, it is
> immediately defeated.

 

They don't get surge, that's from the faq.

## 5 [Mndela on February 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=978684)

Yeah:

1. Thalin kills crows

2. Crows are returned to the encounter deck and it is shuffled

3. Surge effect doesnt trigger.

 

 

PD: if you have 3 last cards and all they are crows... good luck. Not leave Thalin to quest each round! You will win sure.

## 6 [booored on February 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=978731)

no they don't go back in the deck as they are not defeated. This was confirmed multiple times by the designer.

 

Thalins ability removes the card form play even before it is "revealed" .. even before keywords trigger.. it is the same as discarding it from he top of the encounter deck...

booored maybe you are remembering that "discarded" and "defeated" are different (i.e., you can't trigger Landroval if Borormir uses his self-discarding action because he wasn't "defeated")

 

But official replies from Nate, along with the game manual, that "defeated" means a character leaving play as a result of damage tokens being placed on it.

 

"Defeated and destroyed both refer to a character or enemy receiving damage that reduces its hit points to zero, and then being placed in the appropriate discard pile."

 

origin thread is here: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7608788#7608788 [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/7608788#7608788]

 

edit: if "defeated" referred only to damage from combat, Landroval couldn't save heroes who die from Treachery card effects either.

as for the infinite loop, boored is right: the cards will not Surge when Thalin defeats them, so even if you shuffle them back into the encounter deck, there is no loop.

## 9 [booored on February 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=978927)

he doesn't get dmg tokens. the card never even enters play, witch is why the keywords do not trigger.... it is exactly the same as if you discard it off the top of the encounter deck.

just cause you can not understand it doesn't mean it isn't true.

 

The cards never enter play.. this is why the keywords do not resolve, and ALSO why the response text is never able to activate.

I also though that cards revealed where not in play before reaching the staging area, but they are :

http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/96276-ring-and-witch-king/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/96276-ring-and-witch-king/]

 

The enemy is killed before its "when revealed" effect complete because thalin is a passive (that what the faq say if I remember right).

 

 

 

 

to booored : I have seen enough ruling made up on the fly to stop asking myself if they made sense...

## 13 [GrandSpleen on February 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=979423)

yeah, it's a question of resolution order, not of whether or not the card is in play.  Of course you cannot damage a card that has not entered play, and of course you cannot damage a card without putting damage tokens on it (in the 'rules' sense... use dice or whatever, but tokens were placed in spirit).

 

Card gets revealed, then order of resolution would be: 1) reveal card, 2) Thalin's damage, 3) resolve keywords including setting up the next card with Surge, 4) resolve When Revealed, 5) add the card to the staging area, and 6) resolve the card that was Surged.  So if the original card is destroyed by Thalin's damage, the rest doesn't trigger.  But the original card was certainly 'in play.'  

## 14 [Mndela on February 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=979463)

One question. If crows had the 'hidden' keyword. The player must do a hidden check?

## 15 [GrandSpleen on February 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=979497)

No, Thalin's damage comes before any keywords.  The crows would be destroyed before any keywords could trigger.

## 16 [Mndela on February 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=979520)

Ok, thanks.

No... revealing a card is when the keywords trigger.

 

it is DRAW card... Thalin dmg, reveal, keywords, when revealed....

## 18 [Nerdmeister on February 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=980101)

I have been playing it the way Booored describes based on the wording from the FAQ that Thalin´s ability comes before any other effects (I deliberately avoided quoting it because this is the ´feeling´ I had after reading the FAQ).

 

But I must admit that even though I still believe this to be the correct approach, I cannot seem to find any hard evidence either way in the FAQ. If any of you have read such please refer me to it. Until then this is all conjecture to me.

There is no definition in the rulebook for it, but I would prefere "draw" than using "reveal" which is too close to "when revealed". The rulebook use mainly "reveal" though...

@Alogos

And that would be the exact quote which I directly state that I deliberately did not use.

Anyways that quote says nothing about forced effects or really much at all about the main question as to whether the crows forced effect will be activated.

As I said: to me this is merely conjecture

it is conjecture.. but one works with common sense and logic and the other doesn't

## 23 [Nerdmeister on February 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=980149)

So which type of effect is Thalin´s ability?

Passive? Because then eastern crows will not activate their forced effect.

Or is it unique? It does after all have a separate area in the FAQ, which states nothing about it being passive. Though this may, in all fairness have something to do with the fact that passive wasn´t really defined in the early days of the game (but that is more conjecture).

If it is unique then it follows that eastern crows has been in play (as per the witch-king ruling) and thus that it´s forced effect will activate.

 

Quoting Timing of effect resolution doesn´t do much, so long as Thalin´s ability itself is not clearly defined.

 

EDIT: I personally believe Thalin´s effect is a passive ability.

It is passive... passive is anything in text without a bold keyword. Also in the rulebook (not so sure, it's been a while).

 

But why should it prevents the crows from procing their Forced effect ? The forced effect proc when the crows dies, not when revealed...

## 25 [Nerdmeister on February 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=980162)

it is passive, there is no keyword, so it exists outside the timing structure like all the other passive effects in the game. It is "always on".

Well it is "always on" inside of the time-frame given by the card itself, from you exhaust Thalin for the quest till the end of the quest phase.

But in principle, yes that is the way I see it.

Not following you...

 

Thalin effect is a passive (p23 of rulebook), it occures before keyword (p2 of the faq), that's why surge is not happening.

Forced effect is trigger when crow dies. Be it while being revealed or already in the staging area, it is, in both cases, in play. It's forced effect don't occures when he is revealed, knowing if it should proc before or after Thalin's effect has no importance. (but from p.7 of the faq, you now know that constant happen before Forced when relevant...)

 

Don't understand what you are missing.

 

And I search the rulebook for you: p23

They say constant instead of passive, but it's all the same.

 

Please explain clearly what you think is conjecture.

## 29 [GrandSpleen on February 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=980366)

I'm surprised there is so much debate.  Forced effects are active when the card is in play.  It'll have to trigger.

 

As for this "draw / reveal" distinction, the word "draw" is never used in reference to the encounter deck as far as I can tell.  You can "reveal" a card from the encounter deck, "look at" or "search" it and then "add" cards to the staging area... but I don't recall ever seeing a card, or language in the FAQ or manual, that indicates cards are "drawn" from the encounter deck.  Language is used very purposefully when rules are written, so I wouldn't go introducing vocabulary where it isn't specifically used.

I'm with GrandSpleen on this one.

If a card is drawn/taken/revealed or whatever; it is in play.

Thalin does damage before any text on the cards proc as his ability is passive.

So you place a damage token on the cards IN PLAY, before their abilities proc.

Thus the crows are damaged/destroyed/killed or whatever, and THEN it's forced ability procs.

Which means shuffeling it back into the encouter deck.

But that's just how I see the logical steps.

Maybe it's better to clarify by asking for a ruling on it, as I'd like to know.

True, no question there.

The point on the crows card is different though, as it's forced ability procs after it is destroyed.

## 33 [Nerdmeister on February 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=980909)

Seem to recall a very old ruling stating that the crow does not get shuffled back but seems that is outdated now. Anyways I asked Caleb so we can get closure on it:

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If Thalin destroys Eastern Crows after it is revealed from the encounter deck, it will trigger its Forced effect and get shuffled back into the encounter deck. If it was the last card in the encounter deck, then it will be placed back as the only card in the encounter deck.
Cheers,
Caleb

I got a reply form Caleb.. witch is the EXACT opposite form the one I got from Nate a few years ago. This is the 4th rule that they have completely reversed on me. Not even the designers know what the hell they are talkign about.

 

Rule Question:
Thalin + Eastern Crows..

In the FAQ it says that the card is destroyed before the keywords (like surge) resolve.

Doesn't this also mean the response text can not resolve either and when a crow is killed by Thalin during the staging step of the ques phase it is not shuffled into the encounter deck, but instead goes into the discard pile?

Thanks.

 

 

Hi,
The text on the Eastern Crow will still resolve after Thalin destroys it, which will shuffle it back into the encounter deck.
Cheers,
Caleb

Ahah, this one (expecting mischief) is a pure exemple of b**s** ruling : Thalin is an errata, and the explanation given (because there is an official answer for it) is that expecting mischieve having the same wording as Thalin (and it is an action but that create a constant effect during the whole phase) it should be working the same.

 

A card, written like another who have been errated, should work as if it were also errated...

 

Works for me as I'm very tolerant. But I don't use pure logic when trying to understand some of their rules...

## 37 [GrandSpleen on February 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98758-infinite-loop/?do=findComment&comment=981157)

I don't know, plenty of people in this thread have arrived at the correct play sequence using very logical explanations.

 

Thalin is in the "errata" section of the FAQ, but his card text was never changed, so it's hard to say that the card was actually errata'd.  It looks misplaced in the FAQ, really it should be in the question-answer section.

That is because the designers changed from Nate to Caleb.. and Caleb has ruled a different 3ay to the way it was originally rulled.
