Hi,

I want to know which AP is your favourite. I am not talking about quest but about player cards.

So which AP's cards do you use the most?

Another question is, which pack do you like more: The Long Dark or Shadow and Flame? I am talking about player cards again.

Please write, if you are solo or multi player. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hard to say... I use many stuff from many sources.

Good question. Shadow and Flame contains Elrond and Vilya, so that's definitely a plus. The Long Dark contains the Warden of Healing, which has great synergy with Elrond. I like Foundations of Stone, both for quest and player cards (Glorfindel and Light of Valinor). And Watcher in the Water is fun as well, and has Lore Aragorn and Arwen (superb ally).

Yeah... Dwarrowdelf all the way for me. Looking forward to Ringmaker as well.

Edit: Mostly solo or 2-player. Sometimes 3. I am the healer and main quester of the group.

Solo player

Shadow and Flame has better player cards than long dark. You get Elrond Vilya Combo for a whole new deck type. Hands Upon the Bow, Master of the Forge for attachment heavy deck, and a few other really good cards.

The only card that stands out in long dark is Warden of Healing. Hama is good hero, but i don't use him much, since i don't like the deck strategy he uses.

Foundation of Stone and Watcher n the Water are probably two the the best AP,along with Shadow in Flame they have some of the best player cards in the game, you could probably build some good decks with those 3 AP and just a core set.

IMO, the best bang for your buck player card wise, are offered in FoS & stewards fear.

FoS is the Glorfindel power pack, and you simply can't go wrong there. (Great quest multi player)

Stewards fear is basically a deck in a pack. Outlands, ready to play. (Good quest single player)

As for long dark vs shadow flame? I'd pick S&F. Great cards overall.

Long dark got the warden of healing though, which is also good.

My shop hasn't FoS so...

I am not that interested in outlands... But I have some outlands cards from other AtS packs, so I will maybe buy Stewards fear for that shield :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

You should buy Stewards Fear for one of the best quests in the game.

What about SaF quest? I want to try it before The Road Darkens.

## 9 [Djenni on February 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100051-favourite-ap/?do=findComment&comment=995869)

Definitely Foundations of Stone (concerning player cards).

Redhorn Gate (my favorite quest, also my favorite AP when it comes to encounter cards)

 

I play like 95% of the time 2P with my friend. The rest of the time i'm just playing solo trying out new decks.

## 10 [chuckles on February 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100051-favourite-ap/?do=findComment&comment=995875)

Mostly solo.

 

Flame & Shadow over the Long Dark... for the reasons Tracker gave.

 

I would pick FoS overall. FaS would be second... even though bang for buck it has more cards that I use... it pretty much comes down to 5 threat Glorfindel, Light of Valinor & Imladris Stargazer. 

 

Key card comparison (imho): 

FoS: Glorfindel, Light of Valinor, Imladris Stargazer, Daeron's Runes, Asfaloth

SaF: Elrond, Vilya, Hands Upon the Bow, Master of the Forge, Hardy Leadership, We Are Not Idle, Peace, and Thought, Risk Some Light

My favourite: Journey Along the Anduin.

 

I have played a lot, A LOT of times.

 

Always i want to try one new deck the first quest i play is Anduin. I think it is the most normal scenario in all the LOTR-LCG world. Other scenarios always have an special side that you must take care in adittion.

Thanks for your answer, mate, but I want to know which adventure pack's PLAYER CARDS do you use the most? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ah ok, sorry. :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

 

I hate outlanders, but Steward's Fear have all you need to make the most powerfull deck in the LOTR-LCG world. And Shield of Gondor, in adittion :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].

2-player games almost exclusively.  For Shadow and Flame vs. The Long Dark, I would go with SaF.  Hands Upon the Bow is just about the best Tactics event available, Hardy Leadership is a global buff if you are into dwarves, Master of the Forge fits in very well for any attachment-heavy deck with Lore, and Risk Some Light is a fantastic card for multiplayer games.  Not to mention the ever-popular Elrond/Vilya combo.  TLD has some good cards too (I'm looking at you, Warden) but I find SaF player cards more useful overall.

 

As for other packs, Watcher in the Water is very strong for Lore Aragorn + Sword that was Broken, and it also has Arwen and Elrond's Counsel (which shines more if you have Glorfindel for FoS). 

 

The Dead Marshes is also a very strong pack for player cards.  It has Boromir, Fast Hitch (if you like Hobbits) and Vassal of the Windlord (1 resource for 3 attack!  And fantastic for Battle quests).

## 15 [Scroll Lock on February 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100051-favourite-ap/?do=findComment&comment=996362)

i have Dead Marshes yet. I bought it before HoN, because without vassal battle quests would be even harder.

It looks like Dwarrowdelf has the strongest player cards.
