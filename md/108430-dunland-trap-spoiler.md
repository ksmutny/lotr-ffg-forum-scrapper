Couple vs. Cardboard has put up an exclusive spoiler they received of one card from the Dunland Trap AP. It's awesome!

This is a pretty good card, amazing for when you have a 7+ strength Eomer attacking a little enemy... My only complaint would be the art sadly, while the technique is good and overall it's a good piece, it seems the artists have once again looked into the movies for reference. Firefoot is exactly the same color and even has the same kind of spots in his fur as does the movie version:

Sorry for this little rant, but it's a major pet peeve of mine when the art looks so similar to the movies... designers should do something about that.

Wow that's a really fantastic card, absolutely love it. Between this and Rohan warhorse I feel like Eomer probably surpasses Legolas as the premier attacking tactics character. I mean I don't think it's hard to imagine Eomer taking out 3 enemies in a single turn with this. He attacks the first enemy, kills it with his 7 atk, a few points go on enemy 2, he uses warhorse to attack enemy 2, crushes it since it's softened up from firefoot, then all the excess damage kills enemy number 3 outright from firefoot again. Granted enemies with high defense can prevent this but still, he's as potent a killing machine as they come

I think the art is amazing and even if the coloration of the horse is quite similar, who cares? The horse's armaments are quite different, and I think that matters a lot more. Is there any description of what Firefoot looks like in the book?

 

In any case, I'm getting more and more excited to try Eomer. It's taking me a while to loosen my grip on Legolas.

 

This card can be pretty interesting because you can use him to attack a weak enemy to lead to a lot of excess damage, which is then applied to the second enemy as direct damage, so we can skirt around the high defense of some enemies this way. Granted, I have no idea what kinda chances there are to set up this kind of combo.

 

As for being name-specific, I agree that it's sad that it is so focused on Eomer, but there are plenty of ways to grant a lot of attack damage to other characters, so the fact that the additional attack damage is the only thing that specifically applies to Eomer is a good thing.

 

In my mind mounts shouldn't count as restricted attachments. I tend to remove any "restricted" from all mounts and add "A character may only have one mount attachment" because that's honestly more representative of the truth. A character should be able to have armor, a weapon, and a horse, but not be able to have 2 horses. Sadly this means I can't be awesome and have Rohan Warhorse and Firefoot on the same character, but I'll deal with it. This is probably the one house rule that I feel should be an official rule.

 

With that rule, that means I could load up a Dunhere with 2 Spears of the Mark and Firefoot to destroy enemies in the staging area and apply the excess to someone I'm engaged with. Sadly, Firefoot's excess damage effect will only target enemies I'm engaged with, but if I can keep him in a low-threat deck and optionally engage one of the characters, it shouldn't be too difficult.

Cool...although Eomer is the best Hero to attach this, it can also be good on other heroes (Gimli, Bard).

Better thought-out than Asfaloth.

I love name-specific cards. It's a way to add further power and flavor to existing heroes, and it's not like other heroes can't get a benefit out of it.

> Oh great, another name-specific card...

I don't mind the named cards, I understand the possible frustration in their linear function but I like the fact that it creates more unique decks that are tied to the heroes used rather than using the same great cards for each sphere regardless of who you're using.

Well the opposite especially with strong cards such as these it that it's in every single deck because which isn't necessarily ideal either. I'd have to imagine you have to pick your battles when designing such cards and especially when ur creating someonething that is thematically tied to a specific character. There's definetly two sides two it but I agree with the designers in this circumstance

Light of Valinor isn't even name-specific and it's always seen with Glorfindel. I think Firefoot is good enough to be used by plenty of other heroes and I think it can be used as a challenge to NOT use this card with Eomer.

## 14 [MyNeighbourTrololo on June 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1116895)

Why you're referring to two edge scenarios? There is choices outside of it.

 

Light of Valinor is always seen with Glor because he is the only spirit noldor/silvan hero game can offer. Light of Valinor can be used with great success on other elf heroes outside of spirit sphere and won't be hindered.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding you, but Firefoot must be exhausted for his damage transfer ability to work so you can't do it twice in a turn.

You just need somebody to block the enemies with. Chumps do work well with Éomer, though. What seems to be a great card for Éomer and Firefoot is Quick Strike. You can kill two enemies without them having a chance to strike first. Or Forth Éorlingas will let you kill one in the staging and the other engaged (but only after it had attacked).

 

No, really, the Quick Strike Firefoot combo is nice.

The effect with the "right" hero is much less pronounced than with Asfaloth. The key point of the attachment is the carry-over potential for damage. Dunhere comes to mind, since the initial attack doesn't have to be against an enemy engaged with you. Spear of the Mark + Unseen Strike for a staging area attack of 9, dealing 3-5 direct damage to an engaged enemy.

> Oh great, another name-specific card...

the +1 additional attack for Éomer here doesn't make this card much less effective on any other hero. In the grand scheme of things, this card (unlike Asfaoloth, I think) can work well on anyone; Dunhere being a prime choice, as well, since he will often attack alone.

 

It's much more versatile than say, Vilya.

 

Firefoot is definitely a card I'd consider placing on other heroes - where I wouldn't with Asfaloth, and obviously Vilya.

It's not just about +1 lil bonus. It's clearly designed for a hard-hitting melee stand alone hero, where few hero aside from Eomer shine. And being stripped of one restricted slot, even less likely to shine.

Sure, but that's not my point. Dunhere can also be a hard-hitting stand alone hero (into the staging area, at least). So is Gimli (with enough damage on him), or Bard (with his defense lowering ability).

 

There are plenty of prime hero targets for this card - unlike other "named" attachments.

 

Additionally, I rarely use up both restricted slots on a hero anyway - so I don't see that as being much of a restriction (no pun intended?) ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Let me elaborate on this a bit...

Card has plenty of restrictions on it's own:

It requires a Rohan or Tactics hero;

It's unique;

It's restricted;

It requires you to attack alone;

It gives half bonus attack to non-eomer folk.

 

Now to think of utilizing other heroes for this horse... Gimli requires to be severely wounded(probably with a citadel plate slapped across his face, though he won't be able to have two of these with da horse) to perform well, Dunhere will need to strike into the staging area(for his passive and bonus from spear), meaning you'll have to have an engaged an unengaed enemy both in the same time, Bard will need a distant enemy, meaning multiplayer or yew bow(unlikely). Too many if's. While with this horse alone Eomer is already 5, and if something as common as decease of an ally happens, he is 7. With little to no effort. He'd be a natural pick for this card even without this +1 additional advantage. The card is just designed for him.

Question: let's say Eomer attacks and destroys an enemy and 4 damage is left over, so you use Firefoot to place that damage on an enemy with 4 defense. If you then attack with your remaining characters, does that enemies defense get counted again? Just wondering. 

## 24 [PsychoRocka on June 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1117189)

I gotta agree with Trololo on this one. Since I first saw the card this morning I have been thinking of whether or not to proxy it and put it in my tactics/leadership deck to try out on Legolas.

I really think they messed up by making it restricted..... its a horse... you can still use two weapons, have armour etc while riding a horse.

 

The most I could hope for on Legolas would be rivendell blade and firefoot or a dagger of westernesse and firefoot. Either way he has either 4 attack (and negates 2 defense) or 5/6 attack which will only just kill smaller enemies..... unless its an enemy with no armour and only 3 or 4 health he is pretty much never going to spill damage onto a second enemy... even when he does it'll be one or two damage tops.

The only situation I can see this useful in is quests with lots of goblins who have no armour/only 1 or 2 armour and 3 or less health.

 

Similarly with Dunhere with a spear of the mark and firefoot he has 5 attack, even less than Legolas....

 

Unless you run Dunedain Marks or Support of the Eagles I really don't think this card works very well at all with heroes other than Eomer. Eomer has 5 attack with just this card attached.... 6/7 attack with dagger attached as well which would jump to 8/9 when a character leaves play. This 2 or 3 extra attack really makes the difference with this card. Restricted really kills this card for other heroes.

I am with Trolo here as well, but it is the Rohan that really pulls this back. The restricted is also pretty iffy as well. Most Rohan toons need weapons to be effective and they are all restricted apart form the sword that can only go on elves right? So for his effect to really power you up your looking at Gilmi for example, and he hasn't the trait.

This card is good, but it takes a little to get running.

I think the obvious deck is a Fire Deck. Get Steward, Gondorian Fire, add this new card + 1 daggers, add Mighty Prowess and Thalin you have a attack deck that can decimate the play area in a single attack. Thalin hits then as they come out, Prowess hits shared traits gondor fire can hit for mega tons of over powered damgge... I think this could be a strong deck. Some playing will need to be tested.. is it better to have the Gondor Trait 1st or the Rohan trait. Still I think this is a promising card for fun senaginigins

Yeah their defense would still get counted as rather than attack strength, it seems Firefoot more or less does direct damage to them (not even counting their defense) so if 4 damage is left over and you place it on an enemy with 4 defense it'll ignore their defense and so long as they have 4 or less health; it will kill them.

This at least seems to be how it works? It doesn't say anything about their defense coming into play and is worded simply that excess damage is assigned to an enemy. Defense only comes into play when defending an attack I believe.

I could be wrong but it looks like it works this way.

Eagles are Eomer's good friend, their leaving can trigger Eomer's ability, they can support Eomer with considerable attack bonus to make a powerful alone-strike, and make Firefoot's ability effectively.

This works well on non-Eomer heroes if you ever use Unseen Strike, Khazad! Khazad!, or Grave Cairn (does anyone use Grave Cairn?).  If you just have the one attacker but need to kill 2 enemies, you can drop down an event or two to overkill the first guy.

Nothing you've said counters what I've said.

 

I never said Eomer isn't the best fit for this horse (he should be - it's "his").

 

All I'm saying is that, unlike other "named" attachments - this one isn't crazy to put on someone else, and could work quite nicely. Maybe not as nicely as on Eomer, but nicely nonetheless.

 

And, for the record, Gimli having lots of damage, Bard in multiplayer, and Dunhere attacking in the staging area while also having an engaged enemy are not difficult feats to pull off, by any means - certainly not appreciably more difficult than having 2 enemies engaged with you for Firefoot to work on Eomer.

No real point with Dunhere. The horse attachment triggers on engaged enemies. If a Dunhere deck is working you shouldn't have engaged enemies.

Exception might be Khaz quests with all those 2 health goblins. Thalin hits for 1 in quest. Block, shadow effect adds a new goblin to staging area, kill that with Dunhere and splash gose on engaged.. That salready has 1, so you only need 1 extra on your hit to staging.

As an exclusive multi-player player, i've had many games where I needed to engage an enemy to take the heat off others and yet still used Dunhere to engage a higher threat enemy still in the staging area. So, of course there is a point. Will it always go off? No. But it won't always with Eomer, as well.

That's not true. You've said the reason why those heroes would work with the horse, I've said why it would be extremely hard to make them work. It's a lot harder than just having Eomer around.

Yeah, I definitely come at this game in a solo perspective. I play co-op often but not nearly as much, most people I know like to play more the complex and deeper dueling games when face to face. Still I can see how this could happen. Though in my experience most co-op there is a higher threat hand and they usually suck up all the monsters... not often have I seen co-op decks where there is a lot left in the staging area.

Gimli requires to be severely wounded(probably with a citadel plate slapped across his face, though he won't be able to have two of these with da horse) to perform well, Dunhere will need to strike into the staging area(for his passive and bonus from spear), meaning you'll have to have an engaged an unengaed enemy both in the same time, Bard will need a distant enemy, meaning multiplayer or yew bow(unlikely). Too many if's. While with this horse alone Eomer is already 5, and if something as common as decease of an ally happens, he is 7. With little to no effort. He'd be a natural pick for this card even without this +1 additional advantage. The card is just designed for him.

Do you mean Dunedain Mark > Firefoot?

 * Can be played on any Hero
 * Not unique
 * Not restricted
 * No attack restrictions
 * Same attack bonus

Yes, Firefoot is very specific, but that's why it has a powerfull effect. This card allows you to damage high defense enemies while killing weak enemies. And after that you'll be able to attack the high defense enemy.

## 36 [MyNeighbourTrololo on June 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1117539)

My entire point is, with this card being so restricted(not in the game term, but thanks to it too), they could have given this +2 attack bonus to wider audience. If not to all characters, then to rohans. 

 

karagh, you missed my point entirely.

## 37 [Courchevel on June 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1117549)

For me, Dunedain's Mark is far better than Firefoot. Not a single glimpse of thought is needed to say it.

 

In the restriction lists, you can add :

The excess damages redirection need :

- another non-unique enemy engaged with you,

- that enemy needs of course also to be a non-imune to player cards enemy ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

- to exhaust firefoot.

 

So to make it works :

1/ you need Eomer or a zillion combinations of attachments/events played on another hero to make it a powerful striker

2/ you need to be in a situation where you have multiple enemys engaged (or other cards interactions)

3/ you need to manage the combat defense parts before actualy using its power (unless using specific cards)

4/ you need to be able to strike a "small enemy" to make a lot of excess damages, lets say a maximum of 4-5 damages if you strike on the smallest enemys of the game

5/ you can assign this direct damage to non-unique / non-immune foe (which will probably solve nothing as the worst foe are unique or immune - even Mumak has its own type of protection to these direct damages)

 

Conclusion : very complicate to make it efficient, then very small outcome.

I think Bard can be an excellent choice for this.

Bard + Firefoot + Hands (+ Thalin) ---> could kill 2 enemies in quest-phase.

 

You don't need weapons on Bard to use this...7 "attack" isn't bad for normal enemies.

As a Bard "mainer" (I play a lot of multiplayer LotR LCG lately, and I play it with Thalin/Legolas/Bard deck), I would say that for me, Firefoot will be useless as enemies almost never engage me. Other players handle the defense (or I help them with the sentinels), so I can take advantage of ranged attacks and sheet. (and I'd rather use those restricted slots of his for some weps and/or horses that give more than just 1 attack with ocassional chance of overkill)

 

Courchevel [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/user/210058-courchevel/]

The restricitons you listed are not tied to the character it's attached to. My main complaint was narrowing already a narrow-use card by making it less effective on everybody but one single hero in the entire game.

Whether or not restricting the full bonus of attachments to certain heroes is a good thing or not is largely a matter of personal preference, in my opinion. While I can understand the argument that named attachments limit deck building options, I enjoy them because they further flesh out certain heroes and give you a reason to use them over any others. In that way, they actually enhance deck building. With Firefoot around, players have more incentive to use Eomer, rather than whatever Tactics hero they normally prefer. Now, if this was overdone, then it would be a problem, but the number of attachments that are like this is actually quite small. 

 

In terms of gameplay, trying to determine whether a card like Dunedain Mark or Firefoot is better is difficult because you can't really make general conclusions that apply to all cases. It really depends on the deck. While Mark is the superior choice for some decks, I would definitely take Firefoot for an Eomer deck for a few reasons, even if I never used the trampling ability:

 

- +2 attack bonus for Rohan. The only other +2 attack options are both conditional (Dagger of Westernesse and Spear of the Mark). 

- It's a Mount, so you could use the Horse Breeder to fetch it

I tend to agree with Raven here, but I class it as a general failure to understand the game, and card games in general.

 

Cards can not be judged on face value, in a vacuum so to speak. They can only be judged in how they interact with other cards. Comparing Mark to Firefoot makes is not really possible. Sure you can compare the face value of the card, but this has no real relation to the strength of the card once it is included in a deck that replies on the card for synergy.

 

Mark dose add attack to heroes a lot easier (lets just ignore resource requirements) but that is all it dose. It is not a card that synergies easily. The ability to bounce it around between heroes is nice.. but in general, most cases people would cast it and then it stays on that hero. So if you are looking at Firefoot's face value of adding 1attk, then yes it is weaker. Firefoot on the other hand has a synergistic effect. This means the cards true value is unknown until we see the decks that take advantage of that effect. So there is no way to really judge how powerful it will be. There has already been a few decks discussed that I feel are very promising as a powerful monster control hand. Something Mark can NOT do.

 

Is one better than the other? Well.. they are just different.

 

And yes, we would all like to have it with less restrictions, but the deep truth is that restrictions is what forces deck building (as raven kinda said). It is restrictions on cards that makes deck building interesting and fun and innovative.

 

The discussion seams to be, beyond the lame: is it powerful or not, to be about if such restrictions retard deck building options and it doesn't. In fact it increases deck building options by creating cards that only work with other parts of the sets. So as a deck builder you need to make a choice on what cards you use and this forces deck builds.. deck diversity.

 

If this was just all about cards being more powerful than the last released, what you get is power creep. One card replacing the orther and going into all decks.. every deck having the same card. Look at Steward of Gondor.. same card in so many decks.

## 42 [Courchevel on June 12, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108430-dunland-trap-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=1117861)

Ok. I do not like to compare cards, it does not mean anything.

However, the versatility, the non-restricted aspect, the low cost and the belonging to a sphere that does not have much permanent attack boost of Mark of the Dunedain make for me a very useful and polyvalent card.

 

For instance, doing again another comparison ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png], in the same color and for the same type of attachment (horse)

 

Rohan Warhorse :

Being able to attack another foe when you just kill an enemy is a situation that I will face in almost every game I will play.

The card is thus efficient and can bring a real help in common advancement of the game.

 

Firefoot :

Being able to deal excess damage if any to a non-unique non-immune enemy engaged with you when you just kill a foe in a solo attack is a situation very hypothetic, with little chance to occur.

The card is thus very situational and will rarely change course of the game.

 

Then you add :

Firefoot + :

Boost +1 attack (+2 Eomer)

 

Rohan Warhorse + :

Not unique

Cost only 1 ressource

 

Like all of you guys, I love the card for the fluff it adds to the story and even for the singular effect it has. However, I know that there will be very few Firefoot in my build. It will be fun to have the card on board and have its effect working, however, it will not change the course of the game. It will only be a nice gadget to make it works once or twice. May be with future player cards or new scenario, Firefoot would become more game impacting, but, for me, so far no.

 

Again, it is just arguments to explain a personal point of view. I totally respect other views.

Am I alone in thinking that rare combos that are one of the more wonderful aspects of the game?

 

For my play style, I want decks that have all kinds of possibilities, some of which may only happen 1 in every 3 or 4 games. The knowledge that a cataclysmic, almost-impossible, "The Eagles Are Coming! The Tower is Falling!" combo is possible with your deck, but also that the odds may be against it happening -- that's what this game is all about for me. The depth, tension, and narrative possible with that kind of uncertainty is what sets this game apart from every other game I own. 

 

Cards that are simply more powerful are the last thing I want. Simply more powerful won't have me playing this game in 10, 20, 30 years. Bring on Firefoot! Bring on Shadowfax! And while you're at it, make Shadowfax 1 per deck, only able to attach to OHaUH Gandalf, and only while Gandalf is wearing Narya.

This is obviously a good attachment for Eomer as it is his horse and it is nice its not only restricted to him but it does not seem good for other heroes right now. Taking up a restricted slot for only 1 attack with the general restrictions of that hero only attacking alone and placing damage on another enemy engaged with you is certainly conditional and won't happen very often. So I'm not blown away by this card but it is fun and great to have but why didn't Theoden get his horse first!? Oh well...

I understand why these mounts are Restricted, you hold the reigns with one hand and wield your weapon in the other or ride light and carry little into battle but I'd also rather have them be limit one mount per character rather than Restricted because Eomer for example can have Steed of the Mark, Rohan Warhorse and Firefoot all attached to him! What is he doing, running around with a bunch of horses under his control... I guess they are Horse Lords ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I guess the multiple Mount attachments can be viewed the same as multiple Citdel Plates and the like - the Hero just has one especially versatile Mount.  For example, Eomer puts in some extra time in training with Firefoot to gift him with the abilities of the Rohan Warhorse as well!

It works "card games are not object-oriented and are often counter-logic theme-wise and else, they do not need any thematical explanation sheet". I haven't forbidden anyone from playing. So I'll suggest you to go back to complaining about how people are trolls because they do not share your opinion.

I get his point. If the two attachments form Firefoot as a whole, when the horse gets discarded, sure, Firefoot is injured, because Eomer still has the Firefoot card attached so Firefoot is still there, but what happens when Firefoot gets discarded? Is that horse still Firefoot? Its another one completely.

 

I guess that what you could say is that Firefoot was old and died but he had a son and now you're riding on him. There, I gave a thematic justification for that situation. Not sure if it makes complete sense but there you go.

Yea the outrider is very good. He's got a build in feint like that.

If hammerstroke would work like that, it would be too powerful tho.

It's rather situational than weak. Think of it. You hammerstroke entire board, then use this core tactics event that prevents all enemies from attacking one player. And then demolish and massacre.

Exactly.

During our French encounter, the best Rohan deck was using Hama to reuse thicket of spear.

With some resource help from teamates, he was able to pull some the hammer stroke when needed.

I tend to think of running multiple mounts a bit more as if each (additional) mount were a title for the mount.  For example, Eomer could be riding  Firefoot: the Rohan Warhorse, rather than Firefoot *and* a Rohan Warhorse.  It makes no mechanical difference of course, but thematically I think it makes a lot more sense that way.

man, westfold outrider....  The things you can do with this card continue to amaze me.   Such an innocent looking ability but *man*...   definitely one of the all-stars in my rohan deck, and I wasn't even using him to feint.

Right now Eomer's setup is Rohan Warhorse + Spear of the Mark.    Firefoot + Rohan Warhorse is strictly better in every possible way except cost,  at least when it comes to Eomer.

I'm not sure that thematic reasoning like that makes any sense to me as a player. I try and build the most powerful deck I can and if the card has no restrictions I'll put as many mounts under a hero as the deck design needs. It is not up to me to gimp my decks to fit the theme. It is on FFG to make the cards thematic. Now in some cases they fail utterly, and others cards are pretty good.

That being said I think the mounts are fine as they are. I do not mind the restricted nature even if being unique fits the theme of a single horse. The thing is that the restriction is NOT about theme, it is about ability. While there are thematic reasons for the restricted keyword, the more important and 1st duty of it is for limited cards that have synergistic effects or powerful effects. This is why Firefoot is restricted not for some lame thematic reason, it is because of the powerful effect it has and to make it harder to utilise that effect.

I'm not suggesting adding or removing restrictions. I'm suggesting changing the restriction to be more thematic/sensible, and honestly I think that this change wouldn't cause any issues with the current card pool's synergies. I find the fact that only the Tactics mounts are restricted applies to your reasoning, but it also makes little sense to me. In a sphere where we have these awesome things called weapons (and armor), they are adding a bunch of cards that limit your ability to use them.

 

In the story, they were wearing armor, carrying a sword AND spear, and rode on horses... one horse, not two. They certainly were not riding 2 horses that made them ineligible for armor or weapons. Sounds ludicrous. Anyway. I'm done with my rant. I've house-ruled it the way I think it should be, and that's good enough for me.

Yeah, that is because restriction is not about theme it is about card power. Changing this as a house rule will drastically alter the balance of the game, massively increasing the power of your decks. I mean, do what you like.. it is your game.. I certainly do.. but... you know just saying.

yes and no. It will allow me to gain a few more attack power by having Firefoot and weapons, but I won't be able to have Firefoot and Rohan Warhorse at the same time. There are pros and cons, though I generally agree that the power level will be slightly higher. If it proves to be too powerful, then I guess I could just ADD the restriction of only one mount per character without removing the "restricted" keyword. Of course, this would only be a thematic change then which should make my decks weaker/less versatile.

Oh, and I was looking at the Galadhrim Minstrel:

 

MEC26-31-cycle-card-fan.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-ringmaker/MEC26-31-cycle-card-fan.png]

 

I was assuming that her ability would grab an ally, since we already have Master of the Forge to grab attachments, but judging by the length of the text, her ability has to be grabbing attachments:
 

Response: After Galadhrim Minstel enters

play, search the top 5 cards of your deck for an

attachment and add it to your hand. Shuffle the

other cards back into your deck.

 

The ability is different enough from Master of the Forge (enter play ability rather than repeatable by exhausting) and is on a Silvan Minstrel rather than a Noldor Craftsman, so it's ok, but I was hoping for an ally seeker. I also hope her stats prove to be more useful than Master of the Forge since she doesn't need to exhaust each round.

I agree with Scott that the last letter is a "d" and "ally card" fits the space better.  As far as being more useful that Master, Master can use his ability every round where Galadhrim Minstel's ability is an etb.

 

And now that we are talking about that card, weren't the Galadhrim Noldor?

  probably silvan...the length fits perfect:

Exactly. The "d" is from "and". Also, "ally card" still isn't long enough to get the alignment correct.

 

> I agree with Scott that the last letter is a "d" and "ally card" fits the space better.  As far as being more useful that Master, Master can use his ability every round where Galadhrim Minstel's ability is an etb.

 

I didn't say she was more useful. I just said that she's different enough that I'm ok with the similar ability. Besides, usefulness is dependent on what you want to use them for. If you find questing/combat more useful than searching for more attachments, then GM is more useful. Many times I've found that adding a ton of allies that have "exhaust to x..." cards gives me an army of allies that aren't useful for the core actions of the game. While having an Imladris Stargazer, Gleowine, and Master of the Forge all out can be pretty awesome, they might as well be attachments because their stats are pretty weak and don't contribute much after that.

 

I'm absolutely not saying they're bad cards! I'm just saying that your priorities are what you use to compare GM to MotF. Also, in Silvan decks, there are plenty of ways to pop her in and out of play, which should give you plenty of ways to use her ability multiple times.

After thinking more about this card, i came to this:

 

Response: After Galadhrim Minstel enters

play, search the top 5 cards of your deck for an

event card and add it to your hand. Shuffle the

other cards back into your deck.

 

The new silvan events bring allies back into your hand, so it would be a great combo...

It would be a brand-new effect and the wording needs the right space.

Hmm... that might be it, and I agree with @Ana that it makes more sense thematically. Also, judging by my mockup comparisons, it actually lines up more accurately. (I spent a good chunk of time this morning to make sure the text rendering on my card templates matched the real cards as closely as possible... and they match practically perfectly, so this is actually a great test).

And if the effect is so, then it is very strong, so do not expect the stats very high. 1hp is given. 1 will at least but probably not very combatant, right?

Probably 0 attack and 0/1 defense I'd say. 2 willpowerf would be awesome as questing is all you'll really use her for other than the enters play effect (chump blocking as well I suppose) but it'll probably be one.

I think 1 WP, 0 Atk, 0 Def and 1 HP...

 

--> with 2 WP she would be the best lore ally (3 WP with Celeborn)

--> I would play her even with 0-0-0-1...

I consider the Naith Guide to be as powerful or more powerful, so her 3 total stat points can probably be expected, and considering her profession, I agree that she isn't likely to have much combat prowess.

I think galadrim minstrel says 43.

Not too sure tho, But if so it would be in AP 2.

I meant the stats, not the card number.
