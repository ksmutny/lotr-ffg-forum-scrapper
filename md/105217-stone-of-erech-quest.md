Anyone know if they will be adding this quest to the quest tracker soon?

I bought in spain. Since last week was released.

 

In 4 players is very very crazy and funny. We won thanks to needpath, i dont know if we could win without it. ^^

 

 

PD: Sword that was broken is very powerful here..., and temathic!

PD2: in the spanish forum the registered games in the web there isn't still Voice of Isengard.

Any new info on this topic? 

I know it is not the main priority to update a free log for the players. But since it doesn't seem a lot of work it would be nice if they could update the log.

 

Hope they find time for it soon.

 

Kind Regards,

Jban

As far as I can tell, they are working on new tools and features, so this must've gotten lost on their list of to-dos.
