For a 2-player "Escape From Dol Guldur" scenario, can each player play an ally, or is it 1ally/2 players?

The quest reads:

 

"The players, as a group, cannot play more than one ally card each round"

 

keywords here "as a group": you cannot play more than 1 ally / round, regardless of the number of players, during stage 1 and 2 of the Quest. Not so easy apparently, but actually the quest is still easier with a higher number of players: you still have more characters able to generate resources and so on.

Thank you very much, Julia. That's what I thought but I wanted to ask to make sure.

Be advised that 'play' and 'put into play' are separate actions, and there is no restriction against 'putting into play' any number of allies that you want!  So feel free to circumvent the restriction through card effects such as Stand and Fight and Elrond+Vilya!

Also the Fili Kili combo can be used... as well as A Very Good Tale
