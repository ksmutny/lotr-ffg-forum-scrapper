The new card "Tale of Tinuvuel" is spoilered over here:

https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/page-2#entry1911774 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/page-2#entry1911774]

As far as I know the translation reads:

Action: exhaust a Noldor character to ready a Dunedain character, or viceversa. Until the end of the phase, add the exhausted character's willpower to the other character's willpower, attack and defence.

The important part is "character", not "hero".

So here is the point: You have a Warden of Annuminas and the Elladan hero. You are enganged with e.g. 5 enemies and you play ToT on Warden (at the moment 5 willpower) to ready Elladan. Now Elladan gets +5 attack. Assuming this will be enough to kill the first enemy. You pay one resource to ready him. You want to attack next enemy. Does he still have +5 willpower or will that value reduce by one for each fallen enemy???

I guess that it follows the same rules as Gondorian Fire and the like, so the current answer is probably that Elladan's attack goes down 1 every time an enemy dies.

I agree with this interpretation.  I think the developers have made it clear at this point that any "until the end of the phase/round etc." effects are constantly updating as the game state changes.

but with Gondorian Fire it is not a constant update, right?

I allwas thought you pay 1 reseource to "activate" Gondorian Fire, thus having one less att. power than resources before, then paing would again add another "one less than the current" bonus. The bonus is the same indenpenent what you do with the resources afterwards...?!

No, that ruling was recently changed - Gondorian Fire, Blood of Numenor, and Lay of Nimrodel now update the bonus they give if the number of resources changes.

Here is the ruling that PocketWraith is referring to:

> Q: So do Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire work the same way? They are also "until the end of the phase" effects, so they too have to be recalculated whenever resources in that characters pool change? Does the effect on those cards give a static bonus to attack or defense at the time of activation, or are those two operated the same way as Lay of Nimrodel?

> A: Any card effect that lasts until “the end of the phase” or “the end of the round” is a lasting effect and must be recalculated anytime the board state changes. This includes Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire.

> I then went on to point out the prior ruling, which is where the other answer came from.

Assuming the Italian version of the card is correct, it says to add the printed willpower, so Warden of Annúminas would be a bad choice. There are currently no Dúnedain characters with a printed willpower of 3 or higher. For Noldor, hero Galadriel and Círdan have 4, and Glorfindel, Elrond, Gildor, hero Arwen and ally Galadriel have 3 printed willpower.

Good to know it says printed willpower.
