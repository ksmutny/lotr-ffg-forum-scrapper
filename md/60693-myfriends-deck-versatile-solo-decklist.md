is this a solo or multiplayer deck (yes i read the title) if it is a solo, then remove parting gifts and that card dose (almost) nothing, and with the belt why transfer resources at all when you can just use the belt to cast any sphere? And if it is multiplayer, then we need to see the sister deck.

My only real thing about his deck is that it is so attack heavy. I mean Vassle +3, Nanduhirion +4 (with the Dwarf God), Longbeard +3 (with The Dwalf God) .... but where is your questing power? Like .. no where? You have total combined form all allies is 22!! (low) that is with out Ironfoot's buff... and you do not get any of that naturally until your 4 drop. Like I understand that you are planning to quest though combined attacks with Legolas?, is that right... if so.. then were is the Blade of Gondelin?

This deck looks fun, I rarely play aggressive decks and probably should to change it up a bit but at first glance, (with no play though) I would say.. dump out Decendant.. a 4 drop (expensive).. only effects stuff in the staging area (lame) and it has to leave play to activate. Yes the combo of born aloft + EoTMM is tempting... but I think you could possibly find better options here. There is no real threat management so I suspect you are using Born on Gandalf.

Your running 2 leadership sphere heroes and what are you running for leadership? like.. nothing really. 1 ally, and a few events + the attachments.. I think some of the cheap drop allies from leadership would be a good addition for this deck, as the costs seam rather steep. If you do not draw Longbeard early, (you only have 2 as well) you are not going to get a useful ally out for a while. Sure you can drop a vassal on turn 1 or a Gaurdian turn 2 (Legolas quest t1 to get extra resource. defend with Ironfoot) but still ... i dunno.. this deck seams really slow to get moving.

I think this deck shows promise.. .but the lack of questing power scares me, especially as there is no threat management, if the game goes long your score will be high, and how can you stop a build up of locations. I mean if all you are doing is drawing mobs then your good... but you say a "versatile" deck list... I am just not seeing this.

I think the inclusion of Blades to make legolas drop +4 progress tokens would really make this deck more efficient, as a +4 progress can burn away a location or quest quickly. With Support-ofE and EotMM you could conceivably get a VERY heavy hitter in legolas, making it a guaranteed 4 tokens per attack. Also, something to speed it up... put in some lower cost cards.,.. I mean your running 16 allies that are 4+ cost....

Hi! Thanks for your great opinion! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Narvi's Belt, Parting Gifts, Theodred give you a total control on resources. I think that removing Parting Gifts with 2 leadership and on legolas for tacticts, you may suffer resources leak...

Yes, the deck is higly aggressive. I see only now that there is an error: on the list miss Faramir (How edit my starting post? I attache the updated list below). Only the first turn you suffer a only 3-willpower, then with Dain willpower boost of dwarfs, Faramir boost and Legolas power... On the 8th-9th turn you quest for  10-12.

Yes, maybe I should think about Gondelin...

mmmm....yes, I want follow your suggestion and try to replace the Descendant ...

oh! ... Leadership is required for Faramir! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I can assure that with low threat starting (28) and Gandalf  help you can get rid of threat increase. And with Faramir + Dain willpower-up + Legolas you should be able to quest a little...

Yes! I want to follow your suggestions and try to improve the quest ability of this deck! Many Thanks!

However I would be happy if you will test this deck... ;P It's a lot of fun...
