If there is someone who speaks French and English I am very curious about what he means by v2.

I believe this blog intends to do a fan-made update to the cards. I don't speak French, I'm extrapolating from cognates with languages that I do know.

Reading the blog, it's about developping a fan-made variant of the game. Some interesting ideas in there, though I'll stick with the mainstream version ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

With the help of the googles I looked through his proposal.  It is much more than new cards, he has redefined the game structure from the ground up.  While I am all for this, I am afraid he might have made it more complex than most would like.  It is hard for me to say anything specifically though because of translation errors.

Revoir la structure du jeux? Ça sent le Kickstarter à plein nez!....  ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]  À voir pour les droits d'auteur pour Tolkien...

Yeah, looks pretty interesting, almost some MECCG-like elements in there from what I can tell, but I can't really make sense of it with only google translate on my side unfortunately.

Seems like the setup would need new cards, like the Haven card for each player (I LOVE this idea!), and the quests needs 15 quest cards.

Or is there a way tu use all cards already available and just use them in a different way?
