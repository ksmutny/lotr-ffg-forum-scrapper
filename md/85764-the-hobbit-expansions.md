Hey there,

 

I have been wondering if The Hobbit expansions are worth getting? I have the core set and most of the Shadows of Murkwood series. From what I am reading the cards seem to be used just with the adventure and that era.

 

I figured I would drop a post to see what everyone thought about it

 

Cheers,

 

K

i thought i may as well post my reply to your reply here ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

you cannot use treasure cards outside the hobbit boxes..however you can use the player cards and heroes.

the box i think talks about making theme decks with cards which would be around in the time frame, but its just really an idea for deck building

I have the first Hobbit Box and thought it was well worth its money.  Player cards were really good.  Quests are excellent.  They certainly go best buying both of them.  If it was me I think I enjoyed going Khazad-Dum and the the Dwarrowdelf cycle, but you could get the Hobbit boxes first though.

Hobbit Boxes are very fun and have some awesome cards(A Very Good Tale is one of the best).  The second quest in On the Doorstep is not great, but the third is amazing.  3rd quest in the first box is also not reviewed well due to having to make some odd decks to pass riddles with any success, but the other two are very fun.

Having Hobbit boxes you can use the player cards to create dwarve decks that can even kill the one ring  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Hey guys,

 

Thanks for the info. I decided to pick them up and they seem great! I created two decks last night and hope to try them out tonight. The dwarf cards alone are pretty awesome!
