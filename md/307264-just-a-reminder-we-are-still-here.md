Hey Guys

I recently started up a new Lord of the Rings Saga campaign and realized that I'm actually still hosting some community produced resources on my servers, but I'm not sure how many people are even aware of it.  So for the record.

gamersdungeon.net (http://www.gamersdungeon.net/ [http://www.gamersdungeon.net/]) is a gaming blog I write for, its been around for quite a few years and covers a wide range of gaming reviews, opinion articles and various strategy guides, stuff like that.  Mostly board games but there is a lot of RPG, PC game and other articles.  It's kind of a mish-mash but included as part of the site is a Lord of the Rings card game section.

The prize here is the Lord of the Rings LCG companion (http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/ [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/]) which has been maintained very well, it includes a lot of great information on the various expansions, ratings, FAQ information , rules for everything, glossaries.  Its very well done.

We also host the Lord of the Rings LCG Campaign Log tool (http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/campaignlog/ [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/campaignlog/]) .  This is just a nice tool to manage/track your Saga campaigns.

I just wanted to remind everyone that this resource is still around and available, its humble creators should come forth and say hello as well!

These are indeed excellent resources, I used them a lot. Thanks for making them available to us

it would be a shame if those resources were gone...
