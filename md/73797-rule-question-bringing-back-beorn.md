The hero Beorn is immune to player card effects. However, is this negative ability also active while the card is out of the game?

In other words, could I use cards like "Fortune or Fate" or Landroval to return him from the discard pile?

On the one hand it is just an out-of-game card with no active abilities, on the other it does say immune to card effectsâ€¦

i that fortune or fate can as this was clarified that given he is out of play is immune to card effects does not work

Card text is not active when a card is out of play. Fortune or Fate and Landroval can bring Beorn back to play.
