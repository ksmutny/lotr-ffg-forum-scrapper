# [Excess Progress Tokens on Quest card possible?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54436-excess-progress-tokens-on-quest-card-possible/)

Can't find it anything in the rles for this and neither a search of this formu so here it goes.

Question: If a Quest cards has additional Requirements for resolution, besides a number of Progress Tokens.... such as defeating a specific monster or exploring certain locations. What happens to excess Progress Tokens that Players generate during Questing, while this additional Requirement is not met?

Are they placed upon the quest card anyway? Effectively generating more tokens than needed.

Or are they ignored? Basically enforcing a maximum limit equal to the Listed Requirement.

Any official answer here?

You know, I ran into this while playing Anduin and forgot to post about it. I just put the excess tokens on the card (well, I actually left them to the side for easier counting purposes). I didn't see anything in the rulebook about not being allowed to have more tokens than necessary...

This does make a difference though, because I had some enemies constantly removing progress tokens from the quest. If you are allowed excess tokens it can negate that, but without excess tokens you have to worry about keeping your progress up. I'd love this to end up in a FAQ.

I'm not sure about any official ruling on this and would also like to know.  The way that I've been playing is to continue placing progress tokens on the quest card as a cushion against things like Misty Mountain Goblins or treacheries that remove progress tokens from the quest.

I'm the same. You can keep putting them on just in case cards make you lose some.

Exactly. That is why I wonder how it's done. I play it like that as well. i.e. just continue to add Tokens. But I'm not sure if it's correct.

I was wondering the same thing. Until now we've always placed them on the quest card as a sort of buffer. Looking forward to getting an official ruling!

And guys: Thanks for bringing this up!
