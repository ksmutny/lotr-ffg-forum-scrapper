This is my first game with the Spirit deck, the Hero Eowyn is exhausted and has the Treachery card attached Caught in a Web which stops her readying in the refresh phase, l now travel to the Old Forest Road which has the Response allowing me to ready one character, can l ready Eowyn as this is not the refresh phase?

 Yes, you can, for the reasons you state.

In general, you should read the cards very literally and very precisely.

 Similarly you could use Unexpected Courage to ready Eowyn.
