# [Shadows of Mirkwood - Going the distance with one deck](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56290-shadows-of-mirkwood-going-the-distance-with-one-deck/)

With the impending release of Return to Mirkwood , I get to try to run my solo Aragorn, Imrahil, Eowyn deck through the fully Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.  I've been evolving the Leadership - Spirit deck with each AP and playing through the quests.

I know others have been doing similiar  'One Deck to Rule Them All" concepts.  My "rules" are simple.  I take the same heroes, same cards in the deck and play the SoM quests in order - no changes to the heroes or player deck in that cycle playthrough.  I don't bother keeping score - Win or Lose is all that counts.  If I win, I'm off to the next quest.  If I lose I have to replay that quest until I win.  Every game counts as one point.  A perfect score with RTM will be 6 - only having to play each quest once.

I just played through Dead Marshes over the weekend.  I won HfG, JtR, HoEM and DM each the first time.  It took me 3 times to win CatC. So I'm sitting at  a score at 7 at this point.   Ironically I usually win CatC on the first try (darn early Sacks and Hill Trolls!!), and it usually takes me 3 or 4 to win JtR. 

I'll post the current iteration of the deck later if anyone is interested.  I'll probably update it from the cards in RtM (at least I hope so).  And I do make changes in between cycle plays - just not once I start a cycle playthrough.

Anyone else doing something similar?  Care to share your 'rules' and/or deck?

I've had some success with Glorfindel/Beravor/Legolas although sometimes I swap in Bilbo (especially now with Fast Hitch). My deck changes a little bit everytime but I wrote it down on cardgamedb and try to modify it from there.

I like this idea.. but shouldn't your deck include the 3 core quests and Osgiliath as well?

The way I am doing it is that you build a single deck with the cards available that can beat every quest released up to the point that deck was made.

So the plan is to make a Deck, That can do all of Core, Osgilith and SoM cycle (after return is out)

I like the simple scoring system though we have been trying to decide if a side boarding rule should be allowed or not.. at the moment we are thinking not, but as the new cycles come out it "may" be impossible to make a deck that can pass them all. Though this is of course the entire point for teh deck builder to work out a deck that can, so liek I said we are still trying to work it out. Though, one idea was to only allow a side board of 10 cards between cycles and only 1 hero between cycles... but yea.. still on the fense about sideboarding at all.

No sideboard. A lot of people are missing why this game is hard and they claim it is easy instead. Changing deck between quests makes the game much less challenging.

In other words, if someone creates quest heavy player deck , it will slaughter quest heavy scenarios but will have hard time against combat heavy scenarios; allowing to use the sideboard will make this issue dissaper and the game will be easy as cake.

Also, one deck that rules them all should win more than 50% of the games against each quest separately. So at least 3 wins out of 5 games against Rhosgobel , 3 wins out of 5 games against Return to Mirkwood etc. And you may also consider core set quests (yeah, dol guldur will be a major challenge to score 3 out of 5)

I agree no sideboard make game more challenge.

That's a solid combination of characters.  Do you splash in Blue (spirit) to help deal with threat, or are you able to manage it with Gandalf and outrace it for the quests that it can be an issue?

Thanks for the feedback Booored.  Your point about the first 3 quests is valid, and I respect you for tackling that challenge!  At this point I don't think I can build a deck that I would want to play regularly that can beat EfDG so I started with SoM - a bit of compromise, but I'm the type that needs to have fun along with the challenge.  I do think I'll carry over this deck into KD and keep trying through that cycle.  I'm also looking at a second deck with different heroes and colors to do the same for SoM and KD.

I strongly agree with guciomir on the sideboard.  I considered it, but I like the challenge of a stable deck.  Trust me I'd love to only swap in the Lore songs and healing for JtR, but it feels right for me to have to see them sometimes when I'm begging for Steward, Faramir or Northern Tracker in the other quests.  I just keep hoping for a blue or purple healing card!

You raise a good point.  Maybe once I score a 6,  I'll adjust the challenge so that I have to win the scenario 3 out of 5 games to move on.  Otherwise, back to HfG.  I see myself hitting JtR and back to  the drawing board a lot unless I can get some better healing and/or deck manipulation (enounter and player).

At some point I'll incorporate the core quests, but i'll need to improve my deck (and still have it one I want to play) a lot to deal with Dol Guldur.

 Without Lore for Healing or Tactics for Range/Eagles (I know there is a bit of Range elsewhere), how do you get through JtR?

Yea, like if you fail a certain amount of times at a given quest you should fail the quest chain and have to start form the beginning?

Good question! I have the 3 Lore Songs and the 3 Lore of Imladris event cards for the healing.  I use the two leadership Sylvan archers that provide ranged.  I added all these cards (and the miner that gets rid of a condition) after the release of JtR.  To better my chances of drawing these, I have a couple Ancient Mathoms (useful in all the quests really) and, in JtR,  I use Gandalf for drawing purposes primarily. 

With every expansion pack I keep hoping to get blue or purple cards that heal or better archers, but no luck so far.  I've considered adding the Leadership D. Cache card to give one of the heroes ranged, but it would be completely useless in all other scenarios, and I usually lose from wandering around trying to find the athelas rather than bats and the birds.  The bats aren't too bad as you can block them with W, but the birds are a pain.  I've had to break down and have Gandalf kill the birds with direct damage on entry before.

I think this also helps me make the point of why I don't think sideboards are a good idea if you want the challenge.  These cards would be sitting in the sideboard and swapped in for JtR only...and the deck would be more powerful in the other quests.

I'll post my deck and thoughts behind it when I get a few extra minutes.  By the way, I'm not claiming it's the be all/end all of decks.  It's just one that has some versatility and I enjoy playing.

Yep - that sounds right.  I'll probably stick with my one and move on until I get through cycle successfully though...then I'll try to prove consistency!

How about....

Points System For Quest Chain Variant

1) Simple "win/loss" records for each quest.

2) If you win a quest you add the difficulty value to your score. (So Hunt for Golum is worth "4" points if you win)

3) Each loss you minus 1/2 the value of the quest... (So Failing HFG = 2 point penalty)

4) 3 Losses in a single quest means you fail the quest chain and end of game..... or..... 3 Losses TOTAL means you fail the quest chain.. end of game?

5) No Sideboarding

6) Each new quest is as if it is a new "traditional" game.

I like the point system you are speaking of, and I am inclined to think the 3 fails for a single cycle total is game over.... but if you are playing ALL compleated cycles, then 2 fails per quest is end of game...

 

Some things to consider when we define the rules for this variant...

1) Should there be a side board?
2) Should you fail a quest to many times do you fail the entire quest chain?
3) How should points be awarded for quests? Should we use the official system (to much work) Should we use a simple win/lose point value?
4) Should the Variant be only single cycles? Or should it be for ALL cycles. Meaning, that the current variant, means you need a deck for Core+SoM+Osgilliath. Or should the variant mean you have Core OR SoM OR Osgiliath. Or could this just be your choice.
5) Should the variant restict card pool? As in if you are playing SoM quest chain, should you be limited to ONLY the player cards that were released during Core-SOM period.. so no Khazad dum / Darrowdelf. Though if you are playing 2nd option, you can use any cards to the current compleated set (2nd option being that you can chose to play either single cycles or everything up to the end of a full cycle

What do you think?

I like this structure.  For 4, I think 3 losses for the whole cycle means you lose and start over.  I have to say that if I lost each quest twice and then won on the third try to move on, I'd feel like a conquering hero!

My thoughts (bolded) on iGaveHimLife's comments:

I like the point system you are speaking of, and I am inclined to think the 3 fails for a single cycle total is game over.... but if you are playing ALL compleated cycles, then 2 fails per quest is end of game...

 

You lost me a little on this iGHL. I like what you said about 3 losses in a cycle (presumably meaning 3 losses going through the 6 quests of SoM and you have to play each one til you win it.), but I did not follow you on the second half.

Some things to consider when we define the rules for this variant...

1) Should there be a side board? I strongly suggest no. Having the ability to customize your deck against the quest goes against the challenge of making a deck that can deal with each quest and the different obstacles they throw at you.


2) Should you fail a quest to many times do you fail the entire quest chain? I like the idea of losing the cycle on the third loss. Thematically you can think of it as being delayed, injured, whatever enough that Gollum gets away and, and the path is cold.


3) How should points be awarded for quests? Should we use the official system (to much work) Should we use a simple win/lose point value? I personally don't like either scoring system, but that is just me. I do like Booored's suggestion of + Difficulty value for the win and - 1/2 Difficulty value for a loss. Keep it simple would be my mantra here...and to me the emphasis should be on getting throught the different quests successfully, not did I do it in a 3 turn rush or I managed to get to -57 threat.


4) Should the Variant be only single cycles? Or should it be for ALL cycles. Meaning, that the current variant, means you need a deck for Core+SoM+Osgilliath. Or should the variant mean you have Core OR SoM OR Osgiliath. Or could this just be your choice. I'd go with choice on this one though obviously if you're comparing results it's a heck of a lot more impressive if your deck not only handled SoM but the core cycle with EfDG!

5) Should the variant restict card pool? As in if you are playing SoM quest chain, should you be limited to ONLY the player cards that were released during Core-SOM period.. so no Khazad dum / Darrowdelf. Though if you are playing 2nd option, you can use any cards to the current compleated set (2nd option being that you can chose to play either single cycles or everything up to the end of a full cycle; I'd say this is another choice that you sync with folks if you are doing a competition. To me the key is that you can't add cards once you start a cycle. I can tell you that if I finally get another stud Leadership ally in KD, it will go into my deck on the first cycle restart!

What do you think? Great feedback and questions to flesh out the concept

For what it is worth, here is the current iteration of the deck I'm using to try play through the Shadows of Mirkwood.  I'm not claiming this is a great, innovative deck...simply one that I enjoy playing and is pretty versatile.  I have one core set and I've borrowed  2 cards (Steward of Gondor and C's Stone) until I break down and buy a second core set.  I also have all the APs through Dead Marshes. 

I would love to add a couple better allies, but the pickings are slim in leadership and I don't want to go too heavy with Spirit allies as it slows things down if I don't get the stone or the song of travel quickly.  I'l probably add Bronn back in next cycle attempt.  He's overpriced for what you get, but his stats are still strong.

Heroes:  Aragorn, Imrahil, Eownyn (starting threat of 32)  Obviously Eowny is a questing machine, but the real key is the versatility of Aragorn and Imrahil with their abililties to do multiple things pretty well and in the same turn - both are decent at questing, defending or attacking

Allies: (18)

Neutral - Gandalf  x3    

Spirit - The Riddermark's Finest x2;  Elfhelm x2; Northern Tracker x2

Leadership- Snowbourn Scout x2; Silverlode Archer x2;  Dunedain Watcher x2; Faramir x2

Lore - Miner of the Iron Hills x1

Attachments (16)

 Neutral - Song of Wisdom x3; Song of Travel x1

Spirit - Unexpected Courage x1; Ancient Mathom x2

Leadership - Celebrian's Stone x2; Steward of Gondor x3; Dunedain Mark x2; Dunedain Warning x2

Events (17)

Spirit - Dwarven Tomb x1; The Galadrim's Greeting x2; Hasty Stroke x2; A Test of Will x2

Leadership - Sneak Attack x2; Ever Vigilant x2; For Gondor x2; Grim Resolve x1;

Lore - Lore of Imladris x3

Strategies vary by scenario and card draw, but I usually try to get Aragorn as a resource machine with the steward, the stone and the song of wisdom  If I'm heavy on Spirit cards wihout the stone or song, I've made Eowyn the steward at times.  Eowyn's ability and Faramir give a lot of flexibility for controling the pace of questing for some scenarios like CatC and JtR.  Aragorn and Imrahil make solid combatants, especially with Dunendain attachments and On Gondor.  I'd like to be a little ally heavier...

The Lore song and healing cards are there primarily for JtR,  They've been useful in other scenarios, especially healing Grimbeorn in CatC, but if JtR was not in the cycle these cards would be out.  I added Miner just to have at least one card to get rid of a sacked or caught in a web since I was already adding Lore.

Thoughts?

Starting threat 32. How you will deal with a troll in Anduin?? You will get him in the first round and if your starting hands is not good you can lose the game already. 

To deal with Rhosgobel even 3 lore of Ilmadris is not enough sometimes. I have in my Deck 3 lore + 2 Radagast and still very difficult to win. Actually only Rhosgobel is problem for my deck(you can see the thread Glorifindel art deck for solo). All other quests  much more easy. Still didn get dead marches but i dont think is a problem.

I like IGaveHimLife's points,.,

I think 3 losses total = fail of quest chain is fair, and I also like the idea of limiting the card pool to the card list that was available at the time of the last quest in the chain. I also agree on no sideboard and on player choice if you do all quest or just a single cycle.. though there should be a point system for this..

To be honest, this deck does not do well against JtA because of the starting threat.  It can beat it but I need help in the first two turns.  However, I  really built it for the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.  Booored made the point of building one to take on the core quests too - definitely in line with the concept, but Im focusing on SoM for now.

I had 2 Radagasts in at one point for JtR, but cut them out when I started hitting mid 50s in decks size.  I'll have to consider adding him back in.
