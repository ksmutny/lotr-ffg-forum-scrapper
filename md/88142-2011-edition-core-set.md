Can anyone confirm or...what's the word? De-confirm? Anyway, you know what I mean. Does the 2011 edition of the core set have the original cards of the following:

Dol Guldur Beastmaster x 2

Nazgûl of Dol Guldur x 1

The Necromancer's Tower quest card 1

And by original I mean with the non errata text

this game came out in 2011 so i would think so....depends on when ffg did errata. i got the game as it came out, and as you know my first core set and new 2nd core set have different cards in

 

not sure if that helps or not, im not that sure

perhaps ask ffg?

That helped very much actually :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I was in doubt if it came out 2010 or 11. So I think it answered that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I can confirm this, just checked: My Core Set was shipped on April 2011. I preordered it on amazon.com.

All the cards are without errata.
