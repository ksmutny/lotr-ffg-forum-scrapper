I am really sorry but I was not able to find the answer on my own.

Power in the earth card is attachement that is attached to Location card. In the terms of game mechanics, if I placed such card, am I the controller of such attachement or not?

Thanks in advance.

yesm so if a card says discard 1 attacthment you control and you only have that in play- you have to discard it
