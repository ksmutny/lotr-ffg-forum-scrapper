 If i get gandolf (4 damage to one shot kill  the forest spider) or spirit card(-6 threat level to avoid most monsters) at the beginning, i may have a high chance to win, if not, oh well good luck!

What deck u make is not  that important, since u always need to draw the right card at the right time!

Yes, having the right card in hand is important. That's why you construct decks to have extra card drawing power so that this is almost always the case when it matters the most. Admittedly, you can't do that with just the Core Set very well; Ancient Mathom from the Mirkwood cycle is one of the best card-draw specialists, and Bilbo Baggins (not from the Hobbit set, but from the Mirkwood cycle) is a handy hero.

What deck are you using? Perhaps people can help. I know my first decks were crap, and it's no good to have a great deck if you don't know how to use it.

 I v only bought the core set and 2 large expansions, since i can put them all in one box. My heroes are Eleanor,Eowyn and Theodred.

My allies are mostly dwarves(kili and fili), it kinda lacks attack power so if there are 3 more enemies on the stage i am gona loose.

 The new deck box is not very well made, save ur money pls although the idea to attach a token box is excellent.

Wont buy new expansion until they offer new female heroes LOL. Whats the name of that dragon slayer princess again in the movie? Is she an ally?

What kind of event cards and attachments do you have? Generally 50% ally, 25% attachments, 25% events is a good place to start.

I gotta go to bed but will help you tomorrow to the best of my abilities.

I totally feel that. I want Galadriel ASAP (and so do a lot of folks). Dragon slayer princess? Eowyn, she killed the Witch King's mount and then the Witch King (with a little assist from a hobbit).

haha, this one again…(j/k)..lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]….im going to answer with the same reply that i did last time someone said this

1. tolkien's world doesnt have many female heros, its the way it is, but at least the heroines he does have are amazing

2. this game has plenty of female characters, and counting….granted not many heros, but plenty of the allies are female, and with pelagir its still counting.

i have no problem with female players wanting more female heros- thats prefectly understandable, but you seem like a player who isnt familiar with tolkiens written work, correct? in that case you should be aware that tolkien wrote lotr many decades ago, and times were different. FFG can make all the female non-tolkien characters they want, but if you want official lotr women, then, with the exception of galadriel and a few minor characters, we have them - Arwen and Eowyn. oh and theres the women in the houses of healing but i cant see anyone wanting her in a hurry gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

and i do hope that ffg concentrate on the official tolkien characters before home-brewing any of their own, i mean theyre plenty of them out there (but no women haha)

i hope ive put that across in the least sexist way possible

Tolkien wasn't the greatest when it came to populating his works with female characters. But I will say that the few women characters he did write are often less sexist than a lot of modern writers (who have no excuse). Galadriel has one of the most amazing stories in the Silmarillion. And don't forget Luthien who lived long ago in the world of Middle Earth.

of course- if you can say anything it is that there isnt any of the vulnerable female characters that need saving that so populate other fantasy fiction

i challenge any woman (or man) to say that eowyn doesnt kick ass

Oi, don't knock Ioreth. Her and Halbarad had a great time sitting together in Rivendell spinning tales in MECCG. I'll have her Sage advice if FFG lets me.

I designed a deck from the given card pool (1x each of Core, KD, and OHaUH) and barely won Passage Through Mirkwood. I had some bad luck:

First turn: 2 Forest Spiders (enough threat to engage)

Fourth turn: Shadow card Hummerhorns and never saw Hasty Stroke (nor Test of Will for that matter)

Fifth turn: Ungoliant (enough threat to engage)

Sixth turn: Chieftan Ufthak (enough threat to engage)

Quest stage 3: Don't Leave the Path (i.e. kill Ungoliant)

However! I combatted with some of my own luck given to me by Beravor. Whom I will never diss again. Ever. She can give you an extra two cards per turn, and that was more than enough to draw out Sneak Attack, all three Gandalfs, Steward of Gondor (with which to play Gandalfs), and more importantly, Forest Snare to snare Ungoliant so that, after killing Ufthak, I devoted the rest of my Gandalfs to damaging Ungoliant. I only had one Unexpected Courage in the deck, and nabbed it on a Beravor draw.

Eowyn, Beravor, and Theodred: questing, card draw, and resources. Three spheres, but that's why the cards used are so cheap. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]


Hero (3)
Beravor (Core) x1
Eowyn (Core) x1
Theodred (Core) x1

Ally (25)
Henamarth Riversong (Core) x1
Miner of the Iron Hills (Core) x2
Snowbourn Scout (Core) x3
Kili (OHaUH) x2
Fili (OHaUH) x2
Gandalf (Core) x3
Lorien Guide (Core) x2
Daughter of the Nimrodel (Core) x2
Erebor Hammersmith (Core) x2
Silverlode Archer (Core) x2
Guard of the Citadel (Core) x2
Northern Tracker (Core) x2

Attachment (13)
Protector of Lorien (Core) x2
Unexpected Courage (Core) x1
Steward of Gondor (Core) x2
The Favor of the Lady (Core) x2
Forest Snare (Core) x2
Celebrian's Stone (Core) x1
Cram (OHaUH) x3

Event (12)
A Test of Will (Core) x2
Dwarven Tomb (Core) x1
Hasty Stroke (Core) x2
The Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x2
Will of the West (Core) x1
Stand and Fight (Core) x2
Sneak Attack (Core) x2

 

The adventure packs (the small expansions) add so much in terms of card pool… I highly recommend getting some. It's easier to create much more focused decks.

And I'm kind of amazed how useful Cram ended up being in a world with only one Unexpected Courage.

Played with the deck again three more times, because I'm obsessive like that. So far, 2 wins, 2 losses---which isn't bad for a deck thrown together from a limited card pool. On my last game I won I needed to defeat Ungoliant's Spawn… without a Gandalf. I countered the Hummerhorns shadow effect with Hasty Stroke, so I had a ton of allies to attack with. I think if I hadn't had my Hasty Stroke and a few other cards, I would have had Gandalf instead. I already had a Sneak Attack, so boom, boom, Spawn would be dead regardless.

With Beravor I was able to draw half of my deck through the game (which alleviates luck quite a bit). In games with access to a wider card pool, I've been able to use decks that go through almost ALL of my deck by game's end, setting off almost every combo.

That said, in the games I lost, I usually made one mistake and it was all over. It's not a forgiving game….
