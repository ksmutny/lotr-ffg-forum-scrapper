# [Once per Turn Actions?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56388-once-per-turn-actions/)

Hi there,

I was wondering about actions today, are they all by default usable once per turn?

For example Eowyn [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Eowyn] says that the action can be triggered once per turn per player but cards like Protector of Lorien [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Protector%20of%20Lorien] don't say anything.

So for example, can I discard 5 cards to give a Hero +5 will using Protector of Lorien [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Protector%20of%20Lorien]?

Since I saw many people using Unexpected Courage [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Unexpected%20Courage] on Beravor [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Beravor] to draw 4 cards I was wondering about this...

Thanks!

Javier

You can use actions several times each turn since the card text states something else. For example, you can discard 10 cards to raise your willpower or defens by ten using Protector of Lorien.

See official FAQ 1.2:

(1.10) Limitations on Actions
Actions are only limited by whether or not a player can pay the cost of the action, or by built in limitations on the card itself, such as "limit once per round."
Example: Protector of Lorien (CORE 70) reads, "Action: Discard a card from your hand to...." This action may be triggered repeatedly, as long as the card's controller has cards in hand to discard. (p.3)
