I am telling you, one card can change the face of the entire quest...5 damage points is enough kill any hero in the LOTR series in one shot. Without any way to prevent it's forced effect besides threat reduction or attacking it while in the staging area...it will change your game.

Sad..i was going along nicely playing Dol Guldur quest solo...down to 1 hero and 1 still captive.

Too bad ENGAGING them does not prevent their forced effect.

Dunhere and Gandy can take care of the problem for you before it hits too bad. But yeah, Hummerhorns is a nasty card, made no less nasty by its foul Shadow Effect which can really hurt if you're using a meatshield (say Snowbourn Scout) to block a big Enemy, dead blocker + undefended attack = llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] .

hummerhorns is one of them cards that isnt meant to be dealt with face on- i mean its stats are a bit rubbish, so its a card designed to ruin your game is you dont figure a way round it

Frodo is able to survive that effect. If you have two Beekeepers, it's an additional (very costy) way to get rid of those insects. And then there is the Citadel Plate. And Infighting.

There's a fair few ways of dealing with them, hopefully you'll be equipped with some way of dealing with them.

and of course if you have 40 threat and no real good cards out you are 'up an unclean river without any means of propulsion'
