In case you missed it:

"...The physical game will continue to exist alongside the new digital game, offering fans multiple formats to enjoy and more ways to interact with the universe and the game, no matter where you are..."

I was hoping for nothing more.

The real question is... "for how long will they exist alongside one another?" As others have indicated, the names of the two games are nearly identical, and the new cycle looks like it is bringing the card game full circle to an appropriate conclusion.

But truth be told, even though I'm not sure I'll be on board with LotR 2.0/digital, I'm okay with the physical card game ending after this coming cycle (especially if it ends on a high note). My wallet will thank me, and I'm not even halfway through playing all the non-NM quests progression style, even though I own them all.

I can almost guarantee that there will be more cycles after the next one. We know the next cycle is done production already*, so all the playtesters are either playtesting the following cycles or have all been dropped as playtesters. Now there's the NDA and all, but announcing the development of the "LOTR card game will continue" to a room that likely contained a bunch of dropped playtesters doesn't seem like a wise move.

 

*(In fact, based on product codes, we know that this cycle was developed before Annuminas, which came out 16 months ago)

Good observation, Seastan. Hope you're right.

Many other games have digital and physical version too, so yep. They don't directly affect each others.

And LOTR lcg is still very popular, so I also expect to see more content to it.

A story driven scenario reboot would be nice aka something like saga expansions, but lets see what comes out next.

I wouldn't mind if LotR LCG eventually wraps up with a good series of quests, but not before I get my Scouring of the Shire quest!  (Or better yet, a SotS Deluxe Box with accompanying cycle!)
