 Are there any rules/ideas for how you can run tournaments?

Have thought of 2 possibles;

1. Classic, everyone brings a deck, paired of with random people in games per 'table' everyone gets score for the table each round, and then add up several rounds worth of scores, presume you would have to relax the unique rules though (especially for heroes).

2.  Team events, you build deck in teams and play through several scenarios and determine order by team results.

Thoughts?

Only bought the game yesterday and not had chance to play yet, but was just wondering if you could do tournaments at local games club.

Which of the above would seem like the best option (or any other ideas?)

The plan FFG has let us know about for the tourneys is for the tourneys to be team based, 2 players, against a unique scenario for the tourney.

Ok sounds interesting, when/where was that announced?

It was quite a while ago. I don't recall the article title I read it in.

 It's been the speculation ever since I posted the first interview with game producer Jason Walden at Gencon 2010 just a day after the game was first announced. You can find the interview here: thehopelessgamer.blogspot.com/2010/08/lord-of-the-rings-lcg-interview-with.html

Interesting, but not where I saw it as I have never seen that interview or blog ever before.
