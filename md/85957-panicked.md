Need a mini-ruling/clarification.

 

When Revealed: Each player must take a villager token from Rescued Villagers and place it on a location in the staging area, if able.  If no villager tokens were placed on a location by this effect, Panicked! gains surge.

 

 

My question. 

 

The card says "...must TAKE a villager token..."  ///// the card does not say "....must DISCARD a villager token..."

 

Would I be correct in assuming that if there are no locations in the staging area, the card surges and the villager tokens stay where they are?

Yes

I agree. When there are no valid targets for an effect, the effect isn't resolved.
