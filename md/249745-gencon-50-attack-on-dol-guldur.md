But it's not Scouring of the Shire -- hmmm!  Fellowship event?

Ooh, I bet this is the assault that Thranduil and Galadriel lead on Dol Guldur. Galadriel tears the fortress to the ground. 

Alt art Galadriel, anyone? ?

Really glad it isn't Scouring.  I need to figure out how to play these epic multiplayer by myself.  Three  handed guess.

I was hoping for scouring, but that might make more sense as a fall fellowship event, since it'd likely be pretty popular. Hopefully we get it then. At least hoping the gen con and fellowship events are different this year, now that we've had a couple of chances at epic multilayer. I did enjoy epic multilayer, though, and I'm excited to see what this quest will be like.

Definitely. Siege of Annuminas was hysterical last year. I want to do this again, with four friends.

What do you mean by scouring?

The Scouring of the Shire is the last chapter of the Return of the King, detailing the Hobbits' return to the Shire and how they deal with several villains (Saruman and Grima chief among them) who had set up shop there while they had been away. It was omitted from the movies, and seemingly the last Deluxe box of our game as well. A lot of people (myself included) are hoping that it will be added later as a print on demand quest, much like they did for the Tom Bombadil chapters of The Fellowship of the Ring.

To be clear:  I WANT Scouring, but I don't want it until after we have the sixth box.  Dol Guldur just fits better.

I expect it will be too, which is why I felt that Scouring at GC would be too soon.

I am honestly not thrilled about those 12-player scenarios at all, I'd rather have something like the Bree Investigation thingy that any amount of players can play. From the other hand, if they feel to blow some quests out of proportion - I'd rather have them blow those PoD quests I'll never lay my hands on unless I want to specifically.

I have played Annuminas solo and it's still a great quest. Very hard, yes, but that's what GenCon scenarios are.

Yeah, Epic Multiplayer is an optional extra if you have enough people for it, not a necessity for playing the quest.

Fellowship or might even be only next year. How close were the Old Forest/Barrow-Downs released to the black riders?
One thing that makes me tend to the second option is, that the epic mode is perfect for fellowship events as it isn't that easy to get enough players together for a 12 player round and the events increase the chance of a larger player-count. On the other hand a "fellowship" event would fit nicely for the last quest of the campagne (but that holds true for next your, where we maybe only get scouring for both events or an other non-epic GenCon quest).

The info text doesn't give away much information about the quest itself. Would be interessting if this is the actual destruction (what could make an integration into the the saga campagne possible, though unlikely) or a made-up one without deeper meaning.

Submitted my wish list as soon as it opened and didn't get in this year. Pretty disappointed. What are the chances ffg will open another time slot? I don't recall them doing it last year, so I guess not high. I'll be cancelling my gen con trip then. Not pleased.

They did open up another two slots two years ago a few weeks after event registration opened. People also sometimes drop out after a couple of days, so you may want to hold off on canceling just yet. 

I'm with you though, this is pretty much the reason I go to GenCon. FFG seems to consistently underestimate the popularity of this game, and that's pretty frustrating.

Well, gen con gets to keep my money. Some spots opened up Thursday at 4 which was my original pick anyway. Gotta watch the site like a hawk though...

I do wish ffg would provide better organized play opportunities. After putting up with Decipher for the old lord of the rings tcg and wizards for magic, it's really my only complaint about ffg as a company, but it is something.

Is it neccessary with multiple packs to play 12? Maybe a dumb question but these kind of epic scenarios are unknown to me

As I understand it, you can play 1 to 4 players with a single pack but if you want to use the epic rules and run a 12 player game (which this is the first scenario you can do that) then you need 3 packs. 

 

I suspect you could play 4 players 3 times over with a single pack but I think that at specific stages the parties interact and affect each other so it wouldn't quite work. 

 

I bought 3 packs. At some point in the distant future I want to run a solo 12 handed game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] it will take weeks just to design decks from available cards :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Wow. I don't even know if I have enough cards to make 12 decks simulaniously that are all good ? Do you know if it would be wise to get multiple copies of the other Gen Con PoDs? Or is this the only one this far?

The way the Epic Multiplayer mode works is this: You can either play it as a normal quest, with one copy and 1-4 players, or in "Epic Multiplayer Mode" as 3 simultaneous games, each of which can have 1-4 players. Because of the way the games affect one another, it wouldn't be intelligible to try to do epic multiplayer mode with a single copy of the quest--you'd definitely need one for each separate game.

Seige of Annuminas was the first quest to work this way, and Attack on Dol Guldur will be the second. You definitely don't need extra copies of any of the other quests, because they do not support Epic Multiplayer Mode.

And the final two quests of Mountain of Fire can be played simultaneously as a two-table Epic Multiplayer game.

Hehe when I posted my response above I had thought this was the siege of annuminas thread. 

Authraw is right, siege was the first, this will be the second. 

 

I don't THINK mountain of fire will require multiple purchases for its epic mode. ...

Celeborn is only ankle deep, so I wouldn't take it for granted that it's a sea instead of a freshwater body of water.  While the ship behind has a sail, it's very small.

Celeborn did eventually take a ship to the Undying Lands, though the date is not recorded.  Ruling Lorien just wasn't the same without Galadriel.  In the LOTR prologue it states

"It is said that Celeborn went to dwell there [Rivendell] after the departure or Galadriel; but there is no record of the day when at last he sought the Grey Havens, and with him went the last living memory of the Elder Days in Middle Earth."

Dale, while i fully respect and enjoy reading you, maybe more than any other user, the ship is not small. Just look at the warrior figures on it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  . It is a big Elven ship.

FFG rarely make mistakes on character cards but though this card may be magnificent, Celeborn has nothing to do with ships and sea. He went only once to get the ship to Valinor, from Grey Havens probably.

Anyway, it just felt stranfe on my mind, no big deal. I will not get this card as they do not include them in the packs they send to resellers. It would make a very nice poster assuming he is one of the Vanyar that came to fight Morgoth in the end of the first age hahaha

 Caleb said this passage is what the art was based on:

“…the assaults were driven back; and when the Shadow passed, Celeborn came forth and led the host of Lórien over Anduin in many boats. They took Dol Guldur, and Galadriel threw down its walls and laid bare its pits, and the forest was cleansed.” Appendix B, Lord of the Rings.

Well, that depends on which history of Celeborn you adhere to. His history went through several revisions by Tolkien, which can be found in the Unfinished Tales. An argument could be made to go with the last version of Celeborn's history that Tolkien wrote before he died, which made Celeborn one of the Teleri (the "elves of the sea" and the "ship-wrights"), and had him meet Galadriel in Aqualonde in Valinor, before sailing to Beleriand with her and the Noldor. 

The chapter in the Unfinished Tales is very hard to follow and hard to find online, so here's the summary from Tolkien Gateway:

> Quote
> 
> According to an alternate history of Celeborn and Galadriel in Unfinished Tales, Celeborn was a Teler of noble rank in Alqualondë, born Teleporno, grandson of Olwë, King of the Falmari.
> 
> Artanis, Olwë's granddaughter and a Noldorin princess of great beauty, often spent long visits to Alqualondë and her mother’s kin. During this time the two fell in love, and Teleporno gave her the romantic epithet Alatáriel, meaning "Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland". Teleporno's name gained an additional Quenya form, Telporno (pron. [telˈporno]).

Nevertheless, Artanis’s heart was fired by the stories of Fëanor of the open lands across the sea. She urged Teleporno to take a ship eastward to Endor, and he gave in.

Now given that FFG gave Celeborn the Silvan trait it's evident that that they are going by the more widely published version of Celeborn's history in the Silmarillion. But I'll take my Celeborn with a ship in the background please, just so that I can 1-up the other Tolkien nerds :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png].

An argument could be made to go with the last version of Celeborn's history that Tolkien wrote before he died, which made Celeborn one of the Teleri (the "elves of the sea" and the "ship-wrights"), and had him meet Galadriel in Aqualonde in Valinor, before sailing to Beleriand with her and the Noldor.

So, this art is potentially from the Kinslaying?

I got a chance to play this on Thursday. It was really hard, as usual for a GenCon quest. The other table didn't make it more than a half hour in, while our table folded as soon as we reached Stage 3. I haven't had a chance to try it solo yet.

Mechanical spoilers ahead!

It's in many ways similar to Siege of Annuminas, but in reverse. Instead of trying to keep the city at full health, you're the ones doing the damage to the city whenever you destroy Enemies or explore Locations. (The exact amount is listed on the Enemies and Locations themselves, in the spot where victory points usually are). Like in Annuminas you get a couple of rounds to set up before the bad stuff starts to happen in full force.

The game "proper" starts when you reach Stage 3, of which there are 4 different options. Each team has to pick a different option, and at the start of each round you get a chance to switch it up. Each Stage 3 has a different Lieutenant Enemy, a bad effect that hurts each team if you don't place at least 5 progress on it, and a good effect that helps each team if you place at least 10 progress on it. Whichever Stage nobody picked ends up doing its bad stuff to everyone, so there are a lot of things to consider when picking a Stage. I wish we had managed to survive longer, since it would have been really fun to see how this part played out over several rounds.

There were some really tough Enemies, but there were also a bunch of nasty Locations that couldn't get traveled to or have progress placed on them unless you were at a specific Stage 3. There were a lot of them, and they just clogged up the Staging Area and made it really difficult to make progress. I think we would have had an easier time if our table had a little more willpower and a little less focus on combat. We basically just had one dedicated questing deck, with everyone else contributing a little here and there--and that didn't seem to be enough.

Did anyone who went to GenCon actually manage to beat it?

No, but Caleb said my Sunday table made the about the same headway as the best table (about 12 damage to the city), but played the most total rounds before threating out.

I just finished writing a blog post with a breakdown of this quest, complete with nice scans of the encounter cards, if anyone is interested:

Thanks a lot for doing so! Your post was definitely informative and, if this year's Fellowship scenario is Attack on Dol Guldur, now we'll have a good grasp of the horrors that await us :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I really thought we'd get Scouring for the Fellowship event.

Our group played the epic version on Sunday, my brother and I joined two other guys and formed a pick up group and were seated by Caleb (whom I had sign both of my encounter decks). Our group got to stage 3 but had difficulties once we got there. While questing our first card surged three times (same card) so we had plenty of creatures to deal with. Our little group had very little anti-treachery cards and when the time came we did not have any in hand.  In the subsequent fight phase, I was dealing with two creatures whom each received an extra attacks via treacheries which followed the third and final extra attack via another treachery (there were only three and I got all three in a row). I lost two heroes due to these extra attacks but made a dumb mistake as I could have snuck in Gandalf (forgot) and saved one of my heroes. This caused the lead group to give me the tower to help me recover, but they threated out soon afterword.  

Overall it was fun and it was exciting to play an encounter where you have no idea what to expect, just disappointing to have my bad luck affect other groups in epic mode.

Count me in! I really want the Scouring too, but people on Discord said that Caleb (supposedly) confirmed that Attack on Dol Guldur was going to be the Fellowship scenario.

Not supposedly. Actually confirmed.

Man, why didn't I ever think of having Caleb sign my GenCon quest? That's a great idea!
