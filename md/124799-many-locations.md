Hi, 
I just buy lord of the ring LCG and I have a question about many locations.
if they have more than 2 locations in staging area . do it still count the Willpower points ? 
In case 
 I have active 1 location and in staging area have 3 locations. So I try to commits all of my heroes for willpower points but it's not enough to the Willpower and next turn. The willpower will incaese from encounter deck. 
So I can't play 1 player to pass the 2nd question from the starter Lord of the ring LCG. with the starter deck.
Thanks

All cards in the staging area count their Threat. The active location does not count, since you're already "there".

Which standard deck are you playing? Tactics is difficult to quest with, but Spirit is better. The spheres are good at different things. What you can do is to mix heroes from different spheres (maybe Eowyn, Gimli and Thalin, or Aragorn, Beravor and Denethor). That way you can play cards from different spheres and do different things.

This game is pretty difficult, but it gets easier when you learn the mechanics.

What you experienced is a common situation called location lock, and it is mainly due to bad luck drawing only locations, or lack of allies to quest.

Thanks for your answer. I need more practice about the gaming and I'll build my own deck. I just buy and play it for a fews time and got a location lock. sometimes it's 3 location and it not  enough willpower to progress the active location.

Thanks again.

When using just the core set you will notice that only very few cards have a decent amount of Willpower.

I'll make the list for you:

4 - Eowyn
4 - Gandalf (ally)
3 - Glorfindel
2 - Aragorn
2 - Faramir (ally)
2 - Gimli
2 - Gloin
2 - Brok Ironfist (ally)
2 - Beravor

 

These are the only ones with more than 1 Willpower, so when choosing your heroes. Allready a lot of the willpower you will get during the game is fixed. But fortunately there are other cards with less willpower who would serve you a great deal regarding willpower, for example

 

Heroes:

Legolas
 

Allies:

Northern Tracker
Lorien Guide

 

Attachments:
Celebrian's Stone

Blade of Gondolin
Protector of Lorien

Favor of the Lady

 

Events: 

Strength of Will
Radagast's Cunning
Secret Paths

I chose the most relevant ones (probably not complete). So now the major task for you should be to choose which of these cards you like to include in your deck so you are able to win this scenario. I's suggest to play Aragorn - Theodred - Eowyn, since I think this is the most natural attempt to try it with. But you could also try Glorfindel - Denethor - Legolas. or Aragorn - Eowyn - Legolas .... and so on. I think there are plenty of options to try, and find out which kind of strategy suits you best.

If you really like the game, you could start to expand your card set, which will make a lot of the earlier scenario's easier because you get more deck options (and better heroes). My way of expanding was as follows:

1. The Black Riders (4 heroes - 3 scenarios)

2. Khazad Dum (2 heroes - 3 scenarios)
3. Over Hill and Under Hill (4 heroes - 3 scenarios)

4. The Heirs of Numenor (2 heroes - 3 scenarios)

5. a bunch of small expansions

 

But I think if you are looking for some really strong heroes

1. Foundations of Stone
2. Return to Mirkwood
3. Shadow and Flames
....

Or if you just want some really fun (in my opinion)

1. The Dead Marshes

2. Conflict at the Carrock

...

So far my thoughts,
Have fun!!

This is very helpful for me. I really like this game after I play more game and now i'm planing to buy new expansion.

Thank for your advice.
