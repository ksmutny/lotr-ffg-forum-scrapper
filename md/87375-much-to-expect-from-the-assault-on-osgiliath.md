# [Much to Expect from the Assault on Osgiliath](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/)

## 1 [lleimmoen on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=825313)

The preview states the following:

 

In addition to its challenging new scenario and the Palantír, Assault on Osgiliath introduces a new Ranger hero, and a number of cards that support the Gondor and Outlands traits. You’ll also find cards that promote the construction of mono-sphere decks and that represent the effective traps, ambushes, and skirmishes that Ithilien’s scouts andRangers use to weaken their foes. Altogether, it’s a wide array of cards to support multiple new strategies, and you’ll need everything you can find to confront the Orc and Southron hordes and reclaim the city.

 

So we've got the Palantír and eight more player cards (not counting the hero). In those eight cards we're to see support for both Gondor and Outlands, support for mono-sphere decks, support for traps? Even a single more Outlands ally will be enough to strengthen the faction yet some more (especially if not of the Leadership sphere). I hope to see yet another trap surely but perhaps even better a card that fishes it out from the deck, though it is more likely we will see the already spoilt Anborn that brings a trap back from the discard pile. More than the above, I'm really hoping for a strong Gondor card, and by that I mean a card that strengthens a strictly thematic Gondor deck. Like: if all your heroes have the printed (!) Gondor trait, you... eh... win the game? No, not quite like that, but a decent ability to be sure.

 

And above all, I'm looking forward to see a strong Faramir hero card. We've been getting many articles lately, though more often dealing with the future saga or errata, could it be we see Faramir previewed today? Amon Din was out at the very beginning of July, I'm thinking Osgiliath cannot be far off...

I dont really care about Player cards to be honest. But what i do care is about a good interesting and challenge Adventure which is will not be so easy and boring as a last 3 AP.

I know you don't. But some of us do. Understanding is a good thing.

 

As for the quest, I think this one will be hard. And if you want a challenge, try and win the Forest with 4-players (I haven't even got it yet but I've heard it's very hard with 3 or 4 coop).

I dont have much players around in Bangkok. Most of the players play home solo.

So i play mostly solo and 2 players. Some times 3. DF is a cool quest but too easy since there is no much enemies.

Anyway really hope for Osgoliath.

I know, it is not easy to find players for a real coop. I only sometimes do. Still, it is quite easy to handle a coop alone. Also, one needs not take his strongest deck against a relatively easier quest. I found it to be quite a challenge to beat even the "easier" quests with a "weaker" thematic deck.

 

And I'm looking forward to strengthening some of those decks, like a Gondor deck, with the upcoming expansion. The upcoming site hasn't been updated for a while (at least not for Osgiliath) but I have a hunch it cannot be too long before it is out...

i hope that it is around difficulty level 6 (i know that doesnt mean much, but say just a little harder than stewards fear). what i want to know is when are we getting the weapons? we have a cycle based on the most powerful military of the free peoples and we have seen 2 items from her armoury- the spear and shield.....we need more, quick

This one should be cool. Since we already see all this weak encounter decks from HON in first 3 quests. we will use now  a more stronger encounter sets like southrons and the spiders of Morgul Assault. Blood and Vale quests should be strong and difficult. Sounds like 8 10. Will be cool!

 

Sorry but Amon Din is a joke. Im a bit insulted as a player! For what i play my money?

## 8 [richsabre on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=825440)

i know i am repeating myself, but i cant help but to say this- just make weaker decks. just becuase a game exists, it doesnt mean every single quest has to be a huge challenge to win....a game must cater to all difficulty levels and experience.

 

i would be interested to see what the players think of the difficulty, how many thinks it too hard, easy or otherwise. quite a few players over the years have left due to the difficulty of this game, and if ffg actually went ahead with what you wish, then there would be no game left for you to play- most players would have left through complete frustration at the difficulty.

 

not just that, but there are other levels to this game than charging ahead with your best deck. there are many theme players here and they need to be thought about. what i mean by this is that the whole idea of having this game based upon such a great narrative as the lord of the rings is that players can make decks with their favourite characters and go and play against quests that are similar to the books......and as we know theme decks are hardly the best are they?

 

so ffg needs to think about making quests that are within reach of theme decks. as i said on the amon din post, i have not yet tried it with a proper deck (i.e. one i know will easily win it) but i have tried it with a theme deck, and lost...but it was a fun game, and thats all that matters here....not win rates, but fun.

 

so, thats a long, drawn out, way of saying that there are at least some gamers here who do not think amon din laughably easy, personally i am a little tired of the bashing that quest is getting due to its difficulty level, despite it being a good thing for this game- every game needs variation

 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

@lleimmoen -sorry for sidetracking your thread, but i thought it had to be said. now onto the topic at hand, as i said above i want weapons, and reading the part you quoted i think that we shall probably get some, though i think perhaps it will be more ranger based...so how about a ranger bow?

 

i am not sure what it should do, perhaps:

 

Ranger Bow

 

after a hero with ranger bow destroys an enemy, search your deck for 1 trap card and add it to your hand

 

i would also love to see some sort of archery variation for the player....so archery deals X damage in combat phase, perhaps an ambush attatchment that deals X damage to 1 enemy per turn where X is the amount of ranger allies in play?

Glaurung and understanding the others? Are you that naive?

Anyways, I don't expect much from their PR speech. You know, this whole cycle was supposed to improve Gondor and it didn't do much. No, Outlands are a different trait so I don't count it. Also I agree with Rich - shield and a spear....that's it?

This has got to be one of the most anticipated AP's in some time for a few reasons:

1. We have got no news/spoilers on it since it was announced despite it being released likely within the next week or two (US anyway)

2. Faramir hero. I needs it, it is precious to me....and I swear if FFG goes off the deep end and gives us Mablung or Halbarad...I will still buy their product...with bitterness

3. Epic scenario. You can tell that this is set up to be a huge confrontation the likes of which we haven't seen since the HoN box or battle of seven armies to a degree. Heavy expectations for both difficulty and scale abound

Oh yeah, weapons, armies, please! It is easier to be a pacifist once the wild imaginations of youth have been played out in a Middle-earth game...

Yeah, I wonder how different it shall be from Massing at Osgiliath, which I find to be one of the best quests out there (I'm not a fan of the PoD idea but both quests so far rank among the best, for me).

 

Surely we cannot get Mablung as a hero, not whilst Faramir is overdue.

 

On a weapon-related note, I wonder if we ever see siege engines like catapults or trebuchets as player cards.

> just becuase a game exists, it doesnt mean every single quest has to be a huge challenge to win..

rich, there are like almost no quests with a real challenge. MIrkwood cycle has only 1 with a challenge(RtM) Dwarrowdelf has only 1-2.  Hobbit 1 has none.  Not sure about Hobbit 2.  HoN has 2.  I personally think Ithilien is pretty easy.  and so far, 0/3 are challenge in this new cycle.  core has only 1 challenge out of 3.  So that's something like 5/24 quests that actually give you a little bit of a challenge.  Rest are easy.  So the players that like losing to a quest sometimes and having to make lots of strategic decisions, only have a very small margin of quests that are hard.  

 

We dont have almost every single quest a hard quest.  We have way too few hard quests.  

And I can't help saying, the "build a weak junky deck" idea is......not the solution.  I wan't to use powerful cool new cards.  

 

And i dont mean to sound mean.

Agree 100%

But Most of the serious players already leave a game too.......And reason is same.....

## 17 [Pharmboys2013 on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=825694)

I love speculating on player cards, so with the given information...i'll try to do just that:

 

so with 8 player cards remaining after the revealed palantir and the much assumed Faramir Hero we need to satisfy:

Gondor trait

Outlands trait

Mono-sphere capability

Traps

 

Leadership #1- a outlands themed event (leadership seems like the sphere of choice for outlands with hirluin and lord of morthond).  We really dont need anymore outland allies, but some more support in the form of attachments (of which we have one already) or more likely events would be a nice addition if they are intent on continuing to strengthen the trait

Leadership #2 - no clue but another gondor themed card whether that be ally, attachment, or event would be very welcome

 

Tactics #1 - A gondorian weapon attachment of some sort...just needs to happen

Tactics #2 - A gondorian soldier ally (we already have two tactics gondorian defenders its time we have one with some attack strength)

 

Lore #1 - Anborn (hes been spoiled for what seems like forever and with his ability and traits he would satisfy both the Gondor and trap archetypes)

Lore #2- Card which was shown in the reveal article although we can only see the art, not the name or text.  To me it looks like it would be an event and based on the picture, will likely also expand the use of traps

 

Spirit #1 - Book/Scroll of "X" this will be the attachment which plays an event from the discard pile that we have already gotten in the last pack for tactics, and were spoiled for lore and leadership from the last two APs.  Process of deduction means we'll get the spirit one in this pack which also qualifies for the mono-sphere boosting

Spirit #2 -  really no clue, could be anything.  Possibly Mablung since he was partners with Damrod who is presently in the spirit sphere as well.

 

Colorless #1 - Palantir

 

thoughts?

Dwarven Tomb already does this, so i hope the spirit version of this type of attachment is a bit different.

well technically it is a bit different since the scroll will pay for the cost of the event whereas dwarven tomb just puts it in your hand but i know what you mean....i still think it will be the same tho because with that same reasoning, tactics also has a very similar effect with Hama, but nonetheless it was still had the same event recycle effect as anticipated.

 

and while the effects are similar...they are different enough to play different roles.  Dwarven tomb can grab that Elrond's counsel for some immediate threat reduction, a quick Will of the West or Hasty Stroke, or that 1 ally whom was discarded and you really need back.  The scroll can essentially cheapen the costs to replay expensive events like Galadrim's Greeting, Light the Beacons, and Fortune or Fate where even if returned to your hand, you would likely need another turn or so to pay for them

Leadership

The interesting fact is that Leadership is the sphere of choice not only for Outlands (Lord of Morthond) but also Gondor (Boromir, Visionary Leader, etc.). I would certainly like to see a Gondor specific card there, the one requiring all Gondor heroes to be in the line-up.

 

Lore

Yes, more traps, and probably Anborn. It is a bit far-fetched, but I'd like to see a trap that makes resources, like: once the attached enemy leaves play, add a number of resources equal to its threat to one of your heroes (perhaps a bit too strong, but something like that - and making sense also, like getting information out of someone, though that would thematically more likely transformed into cards).

 

Spirit

No idea. An ally would be nice.

 

Tactics

Definitely a weapon, a must, pretty please? (I know it's been printed.) I wouldn't mind seeing an attack modifier but it is not probably where they're going with Gondor. It is hard to beat the big villains like Smaug without an army of allies at the moment... A little threat reduction (as a reward for killing) enemies would be nice... but Spirit got that one already.

what i hope doesnt happen is that we get a weapon but in event form, like goblin cleaver. i much prefer my weapons as attatchments (they look cooler haha)

From what i understand is that if you use the scroll you still need to pay for the event. It's not a freebee, although, if it did the card would be really good, what do others think on this? Edited July 29, 2013 by Tracker1

agreed that would be disappointing to have such cool items reduced to 1 time events

I dont think thats correct, the book of eldacar (tactics scroll) states:

 

Action: Discard Book of Eldacar to play any tactics event card in your discard pile as if it were in your hand. Then, place that event on the bottom of your deck.

 

-so the only cost, is the book itself...unless i've completely misinterpreted it

Well they did have the weapons as treasures in the hobbit boxes. Only the nicknames of the weapons were used as events. And I think they will come out with a new version of the attachment Glamdring.

Here is what I read at TalesfromtheCards.

Ok, Caleb responded to my clarification request, and here’s the word:

“When you use the Action on Book of Eldacar, it allows you to “play any (tactics) event card in your discard pile as if it were in your hand.” That means you have to pay that event’s cost just like you would if you played it from your hand.”

But we still may see this type of card for spirit since if you only own one core set, you only have one Dwarven Tomb.

Yeah, it seems obvious to me that you also pay the cost of the event. So it makes Dwarven Tomb so much better in almost every way (unless the Spirit version is indeed different, which I doubt).

## 30 [lleimmoen on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87375-much-to-expect-from-the-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=825837)

I was writing the above as we got the confirmation, few moments earlier and I could have sounded a bit more clever (or even more redundant).

 

So yes, it is very similar to Dwarven Tomb if you have three Spirit heroes. It can be a bit safer against card that make you discard your hand. It is more vulnerable against those making you discard attachments, obviously.

Khamul, have you tried any of the fan-produced quests? Some of these are pretty tough.

Also, do you build decks specifically to beat a quest?  Playing the same deck against different quests is more challenging...

Is still a very good card. If we got same one for leadership you can play 6 sneak attack Gandalf so this will be real broken ****. If we come to this point probably i stop to play then....  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

That what i do : one quest to rule them all. Still challenge quite low.

 

Now i play trough all Hobbits quest with decks and heroes build up only from core and Hobbits boxes. And is use compaign mode rules if hero die cannot use it anymore and increase starting threat level for the next games by one for each dead hero.

Surprice surprice but is not so difficult as i though.....most difficult was get a treasures card in the first quest ( i lost Beorn cose of this) but secand and third quest i pass without any problems.....will see what happen next.

I really want to see at least one Tactics ally in this pack, and more in the rest of the cycle too. It feels like we've had an endless stream of events and attachments, and hardly any new allies for this sphere since the Mirkwood cycle (with its healthy quota of Eagles) finished.  I just did a quick count of allies per sphere which confirms what I thought (if my counting is accurate), namely that Tactics gets less allies than the other spheres:

 

Tactics - 17

Leadership - 19

Spirit - 20

Lore - 24

Yes, we need more Gondor allies, and in Tactics or Leadership. I actually got so annoyed that there weren't enough that I went ahead and designed a couple of my own... Haven't used them yet though...  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

#1  Cost: 2

Gondorian Soldier
 

1 Willpower

2 Attack 

0 Defense

2 Hit Points

Text: While Gondorian Soldier has 3 or more attack, he gains +2 defense.

 

This card plays into Leadership Boromir's ability, one that needs more attention, especially since it's the Gondor cycle. 

 

#2  Cost: 4

White Tower Knight

 

1 Willpower

2 Attack

2 Defense

3 Hit Points

Sentinel

Text: Response: After White Tower Knight is declared as a defender, add 1 resource to a Gondor hero's resource pool

 

Also for Boromir. I made them so that they'd work well each other. I don't know what spheres they'd both be in yet, but I was thinking Tactics for the Soldier and Leadership for the Knight.

I think they should add nightmare mode into the releases by default, so you can have easy/normal/nightmare out of the box, so we can have easy quests for theme decks, medium difficulty for those that don't want it to be super hard, and real hard challenges for those (such as me) who want very hard quests. Appeal to everyone out of the box.

Oh yeah, we need more synergies with the Leadership Boromir. He seems to be lacking much compared to his Tactics version. I like the way they're designed, the Tactics is a loner who need attachment, the Leadership needs allies. But indeed, as it is now, the Leadership is way to weak yet.

I would like to see a Gondorian Siege Weapon that gives some location management to Tactics, something like:

 

Gondorian Trebuchet

Sphere: Tactics

Cost: 3

Weapon
Attach to a Hero with the Gondor trait. Restricted.  Limit 1 per Hero.

Exhaust Gondorian Trebuchet and attached hero to discard a location with 2 or fewer progress points remaining

I also like the idea of destroying locations as a Tactics player, rather than exploring them. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hmm, the above idea is very intriguing. Surely we shall see locations like Orc Watchtower, with a special trait, and Trebuchet could work against them. But it should also be able to work normally, to make sense even without them.

 

Seeing the battering ram is an enemy, trebuchet could also work as an ally (imagine the whole squad).

No, I haven't.  What ones are you specifically talking about? How much are they?  And how are you supposed to use the new cards for that quest?  No I never make a specific deck EVER to beat a scenario unless I have lost against it many times and i'm trying to beat it.  I try to think of some good chemistry combo between heroes that works out and just make a deck.

But that's exactly what has been happening lately. The great thing was we've been getting more articles again but they're usually about the faq or saga, not the upcoming packs. So whilst I desperately want to know the hero, I'm doubtful we'll see it here before someone spoils it.

Also the upcoming page has just been updated but it can be the pack had been heading to stores for some time already. Last time it only took like a day or between the update and someone saying he had got it. I actually hope that will happen soon, though I'd rather have a teasing preview article first.

In the original reveal article, they mentioned that we will have to literally obtain "osgiliath" traited locations during the course of the quest wich seems seems unique

That means very different from most quests, a side thing going on while doing the quest, which is very good I think.  Makes it more complicated and for me, the more complicated a game is, the better.

This is funny. I am the first surprised because I could have AoO before than USA players and translated into spanish :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]. It's really strange. When is AoO supposed to be released in the USA?

 

The release here in Spain is the 2nd August, but according to the store i'll get my preorder (that includes AoO and others games) the 1st, just tomorrow morning or noon. Sometimes this difference of a day happens because of the carrier.

 

If it is finally as I hope and as the store says, of course I'll put all the information about the hero and more spoilers over here.

 

greetings and sorry about my english.

I would like to see a Gondorian Siege Weapon that gives some location management to Tactics, something like:

 

Gondorian Trebuchet

Sphere: Tactics

Cost: 3

Weapon

Attach to a Hero with the Gondor trait. Restricted.  Limit 1 per Hero.

Exhaust Gondorian Trebuchet and attached hero to discard a location with 2 or fewer progress points remaining

I also like the idea of destroying locations as a Tactics player, rather than exploring them.

Lore

Yes, more traps, and probably Anborn. It is a bit far-fetched, but I'd like to see a trap that makes resources, like: once the attached enemy leaves play, add a number of resources equal to its threat to one of your heroes (perhaps a bit too strong, but something like that - and making sense also, like getting information out of someone, though that would thematically more likely transformed into cards).

 

 

 

These please! I love these ideas! Make it happen FFG! Obey me, or face my powerlessness on any influence whatsoever!

 

On spoilers:

I've thought of something different that I'm going to do with the next 2 APs.

I'm actually NOT going to read any preview or spoiler until I get my greedy hands on the pack myself.

Then I'm going to open it and go through the hero & cards myself and go "oooooh! & aaaaah!"

I'll have the highest anticipation ever if I manage to resist the spoilers! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

@Noccus

 

"Obey me, or face my powerlessness..." is classic.

 

@Sparrowpisuke

 

So it is coming, thanks, but what a disappointment right from the start it seems, what are Faramir's stats, please? I didn't expect (or hoped) that Faramir will be a killing tool in a Lore sphere, it will probably work just fine but I am surprised again.

 

@Asfaloth

 

Hurry, or your fellow country man will spoil them ahead of you... (or not if it is indifferent to you, of course, you've had our thanks in advance anyway, and there's always much to add, confirm or rebuke)

 

@Spanish distribution

 

Well done!

Willpower: 2

Attack: 2

Defense: 2

Hit points: 5

 

Mission: only 1 mission card, and difficulty level 8.

Hmm, interesting there's just one quest stage, surely capturing the locations (or whatever the mechanic is) will make prolong the game much.

 

Still cannot shake the surprise out of my head. Faramir, threat cost 11? Interesting. No trap synergies (I mean written on his card, of course he works well with the Pit and Spikes).

I just registered to say thank you, sparrowpisuke. This really made my day! I had been hoping for Faramir to belong to Lore (for Ranger/ Trap synergy and theme, such as his wizardly aura - according to Samwise - and training in lore and song). 

 

I hope you'll drop some more spoilers along the way. And if you don't mind, could you please describe the artwork or even upload a picture? Even a blurry super low res shot would be absolutely fantastic!

I would take it as great ... but I would agree it is good indeed and yes nicely rounded.

It's ability could prove a bit tricky though , players should have a balance between enemies in stage, attachments-events on enemies and questing ability of their own to use it correctly , at least thats what I think about it

Lore becomes even more powerfull in general terms I believe

Wowww I am ever so pleasantly surprised that he is of the lore sphere and deals with traps (kind of) and not a leadership mono booster.

The ability is...interesting, if a few more traps are released it will be even better.

It has a lot of potential. I don't want to nitpick especially after feeling grateful he's not leadership but I wish his threat was lower. He really doesn't need that high of HP or defense, but so be it; well rounded heroes often find uses where one does not expect.

I will be looking forward to adding him to my mono-sphere lore deck subbing out Strider for Faramir who can team up with Mirlonde and Denethor for a respectable starting threat of 24.

He has some good synergies with the other spheres too.

Spirit gives access to threat lowering which will be important for his ability, also he kind of matches up well with Damrod. With tactics he has as previously mentioned the great yew bow as well as the ever fantastic hands upon the bow.

Can't wait to get my hands on him and see the art

Its ok Rich. 8 is 8. And if there cool encounter deck like southron and Mordor Elite there is a cool game anyway.

But actually that how the difficult level is  working ;

is depend on the encounter sets in the quest.

Very cool cards all around, and I'm happy Faramir works with Ithilien stuff and also I'm happy we got more Ithilien stuff like rangers, bows, etc. My only nitpick is that we got no allies that synergize with Leadership Boromir, but I hope that gets fixed ASAP.

 

Also, more Outlands? Really? They got just so much better now, it was not necessary.

Those leadership Outland cards are just insane. Sword of Morthond is just oozing with potential, can turn the lowly errand rider into a force naught to be reckoned with. The men of the west covers one of the only weakness of outlands ensuring you'll be able to survive those zealous traitors and what-not. My mono leadership outlands deck is salivating in anticipation.

The tactics cards are just ok. The knight has good stats but its a bummer his effect requires all tactics as he would have been nice with the newer Boromir to turn into a 4 attack ally. The fire of Gondor is like the opposite of the spirit attachment we received in the HoN box which no one really seems to use so we'll see if this one gets any play either.

Spirit is good, both cards only useful in mono sphere although. The carpenter will be a nice 3 will power and the book while redundant with dwarves tomb (now I know haha) still has a decent enough effect to possibly run along side

The lore cards are cool, but unless its the ithilien pit one generally would not bother to kill enemies in traps (unless they have archery I suppose) when will we see Anborn?!

Good stuff I'm excited to get my hands on it

The good news is that Sword of Morthond is Unique... only one Gondor ally in play obtains the outlander trait...

Asfaloth, you are amazing!

 

I know people say this a lot, and I often do too, still I really love the cards, almost all of them, pretty much all of them. For me Faramir is perhaps the weakest card (on the first glance, which of course means very little). Too bad Morthond's Sword is unique (I know Outlands hardly need getting any better, the strange thing is that a Gondor ally can now turn Outlands, whilst I was originally thinking the opposite - but it makes sense since Outlands are much more developed than Gondor; and again, Gondor just get little love as a synergy trait)... Men of the West is insanely good, it seems.

But only in a full Spirit line-up. And only for events. Still, I hear you, the card is pretty strong.

Thanks for the spoilers folks! I was hoping Faramir would be Spirit, but after seeing the Lore traps I doubted it. I guess we know two more cards from the coming packs. Have we seen the Artisan keyword before?

Well the Tactics Ally will get a boost so you'll do a free attack with 4, pretty good. That ally also synergizes well with the Ranger strategy of keeping things in the staging area.

 

Faramir is PERFECT!!!

I find both Tactics cards slightly above average. I know it is a big "if" to have a mono-sphere, but then the Knight becomes very, very strong, Son of Arnor plus the great bonus of attacking the enemy (and he can get the easy bonus from Boromir across the table).

 

And the Fire goes great with the Tactics Boromir, to boost his attack by one or two is often good enough to wipe a string of enemies. And there are few attack modifiers in the Tactics sphere (surprisingly). There is Support of the Eagles - hard to set up. Keeping Count - almost impossible to set up right. Dwarven Axe - silly for other than Dwarves. But this becomes a great option, hopefully we'll see more resource acceleration outside the Leadership sphere.

I just used Blood of Numenor to great effect during Into Ithilien's last stage. (It basically won the game for me).

These abilites are amazing during Seige and Battle quests and I have a feeling that we will be seeing a lot of Seige and Battle in the upcoming quests.

 

I'm really freaking out about the awesome synergy between Faramir and a mono-lore ranger deck and a ranged partner deck with Legolas and Bard

But wait, does Earnil's Map even work with A Test of Will? I would say no, since it is an action and there will be no room to play it. So by far the most powerful Spirit event is left out from the equation, isn't it? That makes Dwarven Tomb an infinity better. I actually cannot think of a Spirit event I would like to recycle that much... of course the Leadership version will be a totally different matter...

These are spoilers about the quest so if you want to know nothing about it stop reading from now.

I warned you.

 

Assault on Osgiliath has an only card. 

 

The set up in 1A is: "Each player chooses 1 enemy and 1 unique location and adds them to the staging area".

 

The 1B has not progress points and it reads:

 

Effects of the players cards can not put progress tokens on the locations in the staging area.

Forced: When an Osgiliath Location leaves play as explored location, the first player takes control of that location.

 

If the players control all the Osgiliath locations in game at the end of the round, they win.

Re-reading the cards' text, I will point out that Knight of Minas Tirith gains a response of "after he enters play," which works with A Very Good Tale, Sneak Attack, Stand and Fight. Just, none of them are Tactics, so you need a Song or Good Harvest to play them...

And artisan may be craftsman which we've seen with Erebor Hammersmith or Master of the Forge. I'm hoping we'll see cards that boost these traits, especially the so-far neglected warrior trait.

So far I played it two times. We were two players. I dont know if we made something wrong because of the hurry, but the first time it was really easy and I was wondering where was the 8 difficulty. Any way I recognize that we were really lucky with the encounter cards that first time. We won just when a mumakil came from the encounter deck.

 

Second time was different. We won again but striving more to achive it. We didnt suffer too much as in Ithilien or Cair Andros, but the threat of losing the game was very present. This time we saw the real potential of this quest. It has a different "tempo" than Ithilien or Cair Andros. It has power but at least let you take position and the problems come like waves.

 

I think the difficulty of this quest depends a lot on the cards that are drawing from the encounter deck and certain combinations between them. Imagine a first round with a mumakil and a Mordor Lt. And I think two players mode is precisely the easiest way to beat it.

 

4 players will sweat a lot I think, because the encounter deck is full of hard enemies and treacheries and 4 cards in the quest phase at the same time with this encounter deck could be too much.

 

A solo player is almost suicide (that's the reason of the 8) because you need help to explore and take control of the locations (some locations ask you to spend resources or exhaust heroes to put progress tokens on it).

 

Owning the locations gives some power to the enemies according to the number of locations that you own. Imagine if you as solo player have all of them and all the bonus of the enemies are applicable only against you to the maximum. With more players the locations of Osgiliath are shared, and the bonus for the enemies is reduced with each player.

 

Of course, Osgiliath locations that you own can be lost for different reasons as losing a character, let an attack undefended, etc. In that case they return to the staging area.

 

I think is a great quest and I've liked. Ithilien and Cair Andros are always too thug. AoO seems can be everything, a walk or a hell I think. And the hell comes surely if it takes you much time to accomplished the quest.

 

I must be sure that I made everything right and play it again. I'm sure it will be ruthless the next time so I must not be over confident.

 

Its a good quest. Buy it. :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

PD: We played with monosphere Lore and Spirit. In Spirit I use Spiritfindel and he is a little cheat i must say. Very powerful to this quest.

Well only the Osgiliath Locations, are immune to player card effects, not the other ones from before in the Haradrim and Southron encounter sets.  At least thats my guess....

All the locations are immune to player card effects while they are in the staging area, not only Osgiliath locations.

 

But I ignore that rule when a location is the active location, for active location is out of the staging area as I understand reading the game rules.

 

I' ve just made a third attempt and this time we have lost. It has been amazing and incredible, a long and weary battle that seemed lost until we overcame heroically. Just at the end of all we had controlled all the Osgiliath locations and we only had to resist the last attack of two enemies to win. Then the last shadow effect of an enemy has added +1 attack for each osgiliath locations that I was controlling so my enemy got 10 attack and poor Frodo couldn`t make it even with his special rule. My threat was in 43. Because of Frodo's death, two of the Osgiliath locations has returned to the staging area and my playmate and I were too weak at that moment to retake them.

Wow this pack looks amazing!!! I really like the lore bow, it´s just what i wanted since the anouncement of this cycle. The outland cards are excellent, the tactics knight is fantastic and the quest seems like a real battle struggling to win each location let´s see how will it go against the outland army (suicide or not i will fight for osgiliath). The only things that doesn´t fully like me is Faramir (odd right?) i was expecting a bit more of epicness from him but i guess i´ll have to play with him to see. Magali´s art of the brothers might be even greater than the elves, i cannot wait to see them in a lineup. Excellent pack!!

Asfaloth,

Just want to make sure it is a regular action that be could be used after staging, or is it a combat action?

That's also my most burning question regarding this (potentially) awesome attachment. In addition, could you please confirm that it says attach to a Ranger and not a Ranged character, please? It's less likely for you to mix it up in Spanish since 'a distancia' and 'mantaraz' are better to tell apart than 'ranger' and 'ranged', but just in case...    :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

If the bow can be attached to a Ranger and can be used in a general Action Window, my first choice will be the Ithilien Tracker (Ranger that lacks ranged). Having more than one is pretty pointless, so this bow would be ver welcome for these allies - and finally match the card's artwork.   :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Been thinking of some card combos for Faramir, in mono lore where he obviously fits best because of the other traps and rangers, he can take full advantage of advanced warning, a card that has thus far flown under the radar but becomes a staple in a deck with the new Faramir.

I also expect the black riders box to make Faramir quite useful as well. The lore event that was spoiled which in erases engage,net cost by 5 is perfect and it decreases in cost by hobbit or ranger heroes. Pair him with the new Pippen and Sam and you have a respectable starting threat of 25, increase all enemy engagement by 2 and have instant access to card draw good starting will power from Sam that lore often lacks. It's also fairly thematic too given Faramir's interaction with both of those two hobbits

Perhaps one so far overlooked (or not mentioned) card of the set: the Carpenter of Pelargir. Of course, it is really only worth it in a mono-Spirit but it is a very nice addition to it. I actually like both the Carpenter and the Knight for mono-decks, very much.

As for Ranger Bow its Action is a regular Action.

 

It must be attached to a Ranger character for sure (Ranger is Montaraz in spanish and that's the word in this case).

 

As a matter of fact, this item doesn't give Ranged Attack, it only gives the Action.

 

 

The Carpenter is for me a great Card. If you have a mono spirit with Eowyn, Glorfindel with Light of Valinor and you play the carpenter you have 10 will. You almost can win every quest commitment with little help of your playmates.

Direct damage is intriguing. But the fact one has to exhaust both the weapon and the attached character (to deal a single damage) makes it hard to operate. Of course, you can employ Tactics to deal more damage but Hail of Stones works just the same way - and you can exhaust any character. The great difference, of course, is that you can keep the bow throughout the game, but will it be enough to chip away the ever more sturdier foes? Lore does get more help in that department, I certainly like the way it's fighting its war, Expecting Mischief and the new Patrol can surely help  Now we need at least one more useful trap and Anborn.

The bow can ensure that no 1 HP enemies will ever engage you. And if you combine Faramir with Beregond (and the Spear of the Citadel), you won't have to worry about 2 HP enemies, either. Equipping a Gondorian Spearman with the Spear of the Citadel would even get rid of 3 HP enemies. And if you are a player not interested in theme, Thalin could add another point of direct damage.

 

It's a long shot, but Faramir/ Thalin/ Beravor (card draw, Lore resources) would only require: Gondorian Spearman, Spear of the Citadel, Ithilien Tracker, Ranger Bow to never worry about 4 HP enemies.

I've been a fan of such decks for a while. And since I'm not very fond of Dwarf decks, Thalin is (ironically) a Dwarf that has seen most play with me (though not at the time of the core set). As I said, it is all very intriguing but felling enemies is not the only worry of the game, especially if you cannot fell them during staging (though the weaker ones you can with the above deck). You still need to quest, explore locations, etc,, and the line-up above will hardly excel at that.

 

As pointed elsewhere, though, Faramir will easily be one of the best "battle" questers, probably the very best (together with his Leadership brother).

Wow, neat. Happy I was playing it right with my proxies. I had 3 of these bows out in a game and was pretty much taking out most enemies in the staging area before they could contribute threat. Takes a bit of set up time. With anborn, I was also able to reuse Ranger spikes every turn. Kind of crazy. No enemy could engage me by mid game.

The bow is not unique is it? Seems not since you listed all the other unique cards in the pack.

I wonder if Infighting will become useful now.  Say you have a high HP enemy caught in Ranger Spikes and you are able to use Ranger Bows and Patrol of the Forest over a few turns to stack up 3-5 damage on the enemy.  Then when a troublesome enemy gets revealed, you can use Infighting to instantly kill it.

Sure, the trick was there already with Forest Snare but it has become much more effective now, with the Spikes and Bow. The Pit and Mirkwood Runner can also cooperate. It is just so hard to fit all the tricks into a deck, and yet make it do usual essential stuff...

In this same pack we will also get the Sword of Morthond which while classified as a "weapon" does not really have an effect that's very weapon like. Still holding out hope for a tactics or leadership based Gondor weapon

They are all far from friendly, but i think worst encounter card is

Commander of Southrons (37; 3,5,3, 6HP). Harad.

When revealed: Commander of Southrons makes an attack from the staging area aigainst each player who controls at least 1 location.

 

Its more or less a double Harads Elite. And 2 copys of him in deck.

Hmmmh. Not sure what to think about this adventure. Just won my first game, but lost the two previous ones due to Mumakil being revealed early. The win was rather easy. I predict that Shadow of the Past is going to be the star of this scenario. It simply helps you to avoid revaling both new Osgiliath locations from the encounter deck and nasty enemies.

 

The quest seems to be very luck based. In my case I got an ealry Western Gate which added the battle keyword which was fueling my mono tactics deck. I finsihed after 8 turns, using 2 copies of SotP to choose harmless encounters. After Western Quarter(?)got the Eastern Quarter(?), two harmless treacheries, one enemy and Ruined Tower.

 

The win felt rather easy, while the losses felt inevitable. None of the three approaches felt like a true challenge. I'm a bit disappointed, to be honest.

 

Edit: corrected location names, translated from German to English

To add some positive thoughts:

 

The art is fatastic. The quest card is probably the most beautiful card they have published so far. The locations look great, too. :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

 

I like that the players can choose location and enemy that they want to add to the stating area during the setup. That gives each kind of deck a fair chance to win. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Definitely. Just had one game with no locations but lots of enemies. All I needed to do was to hold them off until I could explore the first location. Still the quest has a lot of good ideas, but IMO the encounter deck is too big (50 cards) and unpredictable.

I would like try DF with 4 but there not much players around me so i play mostly solo. In Thailand this game not so popular.

So i play solo mostly, sometimes play with my friend (but we dont do anymore since we win all quests and now is boring) and very rare play 3 players. 4 players we do only once again MAO and was terribly destroyed.

Have a winning streak of 4 games. Last game was a lore deck with Faramir, Aragorn and Mirlonde. That was a quite challenging and fun game. I had almost all Ranger cards in my deck. Trapped one enemy early and boosted Faramir's attack by 1. Shot two enemies in the staging area by using Gondorian Pit and Forest Patrol. Took me 14 turns to finish and I lost 3 allies. Thanks to Mirlonde/Silvan Tracker a lot of the damage by archery could be healed instantly. The good thing is that you really have to consider your options. I was facing two brutal enemies (6 ATT and 4 ATT) and didn't have a lot of defending power. Both Aragorn and Faramir had a near-death-experience (guess why :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ), but they recovered. And all the way I tried to find a way to get rid of these enemies, to get at least some WP to the quest and not to loose too many locations that I already controlled.

 

Btw, I wasn't disappointed with Amon Din. Like others said, you should try some different decks. Playing a Hobbit deck is fun, or mono tactics, if you want a real challenge. I'm afraid that your Thorin Company deck is going to beat Osgiliath as easily as all the other scenarios. You say you don't want to cripple yourself by using a deck that isn't perfect, but I think by you're missing all the opportunities of deckbuilding that this game offers. And that's crippling your game experience.

If you have 3 copies of Warden of healing on table + 6 other 2 HP allys, they will be dead with 16 archery even before being able to heal anything, so unfortunately this is a good idea but not possible.

Mirlonde, Elrond, Haldir, 2 Gondorian healers and 2 Silvan Trackers should do the job. If you have them at hand, that is.

Yes that how i deal with this quest. And other players have Wardens. This quest can delay you a lot but you will win in the end of the day.

You have to delve depper into the narrative. When playing a Hobbit deck I think of these three frightened halflings who need every help they can to make it through the quest. Or you have to take it as a challenge. To build a deck with a theme that is not supposed to win against a certain scenario is such a deck building challenge. For example, it took me more than 20 failed approaches to finally build a mono tactics deck that was winning against Amon Din more than half of the games. That's kind of playing in nightmare mode (in which the nightmare is that all dwarves have vanished ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ).

I sometimes play solo using 4 decks.

 

That is so I can get a feel for how the decks synergize with each other and them let my friends join in when we're having a game night or whatever.

 

You should do that with all the quests. I think you'd enjoy the challenge

Wow wow wow! The art is simply amazing!!! I think it´s better than the locations of Emyn Muil and Redhorn Gate. The east and west quarter and the ruined tower!! Simply amazing.

And the english texts are now online as well, with a rough translation of the adventure card. All other cards are the original texts of the english cards.

After still being a bit disappointed about the solo experience of AaO, I played the scenario two handed. Thalin, Beregond and Legolas on one side and New Boromir, Mirlonde and Faramir on the other.

 

The game experience changed quite a lot, as the scenario becomes much more challenging with two players. It's a struggle from start to end (in my case: loss after reaching the threat limit after about 13 turns), but all these new cards and synergies allow you to use different startegies to handle threat and enemies without dominating the encounter deck. Everyone who is playing this multiplayer will cry from joy!

 

The only downside was Faramir, who wasn't as useful as expected. His ability never came into play, but that's partly because the deck's high threat cost and Legolas need to kill enemies don't support him really much. Guess I'm going to change it to a mono lore deck instead.

I just picked up my pack and there is more to this than meets the eye.  On the instruction sheet it explains that even though you might explore a location, it doesn't really leave play.  The first player takes control of the location, but all of its effects are still active.  I think the crapshoot analogy is spot on here.

Just played my first game solo and won on turn two. I was like "Wait, what? I win?"

Cover me, I shuffling up and heading back in!

Ok, game two and another turn two win. Hint for solo players who want the game to last a little longer: don't select The King's Library as your starting location.

(I'm going to select randomly from now on.)

I just read the preview and, It sounds like you have to encounter and collect all Osgiliath locations in the whole encounter deck, but the way you describe it seems like just the locations in the staging area.

I don't have it yet but does the rules insert make this more clear. Could be very challenging to have to get all locations to win.

from todays preview, it looks like a great pack. looking forward to getting it. Looks like Gondorian fire will make Boromir even more of a killing machine than he already is. Its odd that Knight of Minas Tirith requires three tactics heroes, though, as so far (unless i'm mistaken), we only have two Gondor tactics heroes. Men of the West seems like a good addition to the outlands decks too.

The quest card itself makes it clear.

If the players control all Osgiliath locations in play at the end of the round.

Yep, that's correct. In the beginning I accidently played it like I had to explore all locations (missed the "in play" bit). Welll, there is a total of 14 Osgiliath locations. That was quite a frustrating experience, lol.

did you have steward on legolas? that would be a nice combo to give u the resources to make gondorian fire powerful
