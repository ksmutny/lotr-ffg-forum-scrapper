to buy Dwarrowdelf cycle?  I know it's out of print and that many people ask about when it will be reprinted.  I'm more wondering where I can get the packs, even at a mark up.  In particular I'm looking for Watcher in the Water, Foundations of Stone, and Shadow and Flame.  I can find the Long Dark for 40 USD (amazon I think), and I know that packs will occasionally come up on ebay, but does anyone know where they can be found, even marked up?

Thank you

Those three have just about vanished off the face of the earth. Be on the look out on Ebay for packs, outrageous the prices though be.

It would be nice if FFG's "print on demand" allowed for printing on demand.

I think that was only for the standalone scenarios and nightmare decks.
