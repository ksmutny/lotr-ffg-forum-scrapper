Is there a resource somewhere that makes it easy to identify how many total encounter cards there are in each cycle?  So far, the only searching methods I've found have required me to click through a bunch of different pages and manually add up the number.

You can guesstimate at about 26-28 encounter cards per Adventure Pack, give or take if there are more or less quest cards and special objectives/enemies.  For the deluxe expansions most of it is encounter cards and you can look at the rules booklet to see the number.  For example The Lost Realm booklet says it has 119 encounter cards.

 

You might also check out the page on BoardGameGeek.com there may be an Excel spreadsheet with the numbers of each specific card in the "Files" section.

For the next release I will add totals to the Scenarios page on Hall of Beorn card search. I already have this number for the charts on that page, I just don't display it anywhere.

About 180-190 encounter cards and 30-35 quest cards for each cycle (includes deluxe + 6 APs).
