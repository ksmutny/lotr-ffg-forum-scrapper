Post your spoilers here, because Celebrimbor's Secret is already due to be released in 10 days! What?! Yes, 13 november! So most likely we will be getting spoilers soon (or not) but anyway, if you own a pack by the time, please post some spoilers! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I really feel for the non-USA players, i'm sooo impatient when it comes to getting these cards, the  extra wait would drive me crazy

Call me pessimistic, but there's no way it'll be released that early. Though my hopes are up, lol.

Their "anticipated availability" is garbage, but when they actually set a firm release date on something I have never not seen it available that day (if not earlier from local stores or online retailers)

Yeah man I'm super impatient as well and hate seeing others talk about their experiences and the fact they have the cards like two to three weeks before I ever get my hands on them. Sucks big time.....

Really wish it was like MtG and it was released across the world on the same date but that will never happen.

That's why I subscribed to Team Covenant. They posted my Nin-in-Eilph from Oklahoma on the 22nd and I received it here in Sweden on the 28th - 6 days later! And there really is no extra wait - since we get every pack at least a few days later than US players, the timespan in-between is about the same. If I'm impatient, I just stay away from the forums and occupy myself with something else.

Does it cost more if you order through them? I'm curious since i usually have to wait 2x weeks for my packs and i live in Iceland.

Interesting. How much did you pay to have the pack sent to Sweden?
