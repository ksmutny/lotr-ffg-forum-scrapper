Rider Of The Mark:  Spirit Ally, Cost 2

Action:  Spend 1 Spirit Resource to give control of Rider Of The Mark to another player.

Response:  After Rider Of The Mark changes control, discard a shadow card dealt to an enemy you are engaged with.

 

 

Who does the "you" in the response text refer to?  The player who initiated the Action text or the new controller of the Rider?

as it is a response to the action you initiated then i would say it is the person who spent the resource, not the the reciever

But …

The section in the Rulebook on Responses, page 23, says responses "can be triggered by their controller".  And the text for Rider Of The Mark says the Response is triggered AFTER the change of control …

 The new player gets to lose the shadow card.

If you go for the theme: One player sends information to the other player via the rider.

A couple more questions on this subject... Can the rider cause the discard of a shadow card that has already been revealed? Also after the rider has changed to another players control does it remain in their control for the rest of the game?

i would say you can change him as many times as you like - it isnt a 1 per game thing, and i would also say it cannot discard a revealed shadow card as you need a response style card such as hasty stroke to do this. ultimately this card is an 'action' card with a response that comes from that 'action'

Yes makes sense with the shadow card being unrevealed. Presumably the receiving player would need a character with a spirit resource pool in order to swap him back? Otherwise i assume he would be stuck there?

## 9 [richsabre on July 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71548-rider-of-the-mark/?do=findComment&comment=809327)

yes that is correct, otherwise you could use good harvest

it is limited to once a round but you can do it as many times as you like in a game. Also it dose say it requires a spirit payment to swap, so both players need a spirit icon on a resource generating hero.

or you could use this just before triggering the action. though its not a particularly effective strategty

This is another one of those weird "meta" questions, but does paying ta resource o trigger an action count as "paying for cards that belong to the named sphere" per good harvest's text?

i would say so - i think technically you are paying 'for' the card, just to activate and play it

I went ahead and submitted a rules question about that just to be sure.

Oh one other thing on this, can you give control of the rider when he is exhausted to get rid of the shadow card? Or does he have to be ready?

it makes no difference. the action doesnt specify that he must be ready, as he is not exhausting or anything to use his action

No. Paying for cards is defined as putting into play. Not for paid abilities. This is what seperates "A Good harvest" from the Leadership Belt for example. One adds a resource icon, that allows payments for any effect, and the other statesthat it only works for "PAYING" for a card... witch means paying the cost of casting it.

It is hard for MTG players to get a grip on, but in most LCGs being tapped dose not affect the cards ability to activate its text. There are a number of cards that do, but as they are an exception they have "exhaust" as part of their costs.

Sorry, bzzzt! Thanks for playing!  Official answer came in today: A Good Harvest can be used to pay for a card's ability as well as to play it.
