# [Arwen&#039;s shield bonus?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123642-arwens-shield-bonus/)

I think I know what the answer is, which will mean I'm getting better at this game, when Arwen's response is to give a +1 shield to a character. Then Arwen dies. Does the shield bonus remain on the character to the end of the round as stated?

 

I think yes, but I may be wrong.

 

Can you enlighten me?

 

Many thanks.

Arwen's card reads:

 

Response: After Arwen Undomiel exhausts, choose a character. That character gains Sentinel and +1 [Defense] until the end of the round.

 

So, I think the condition required for that character to gain the Sentinel keyword and have the extra shield is that that character is chosen after Arwen exhausts, whatever the fate of Arwen in the specific round.

That's as I read it. I must be getting better at this game.

 

Thanks very much for a lightening response.
