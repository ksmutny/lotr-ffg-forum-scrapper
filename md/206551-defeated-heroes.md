What happens when heroes are defeated? Is there a way to bring them back?

When a hero is defeated all of his/her non-objective attachments are discarded, along with their wounds and resources, and they are then discarded as well.

Â 

You can bring them back to action with Fortune or Fate (in fact there's an entire deck designed with utilizing this card repeatedly) or Landroval (hero stays in play with one damage on them).

I thought that might be the case based on that card, but I was having trouble tracking down the rule. Thanks guys.

Technically the hero goes in the discard pile but since heroes can't go in the deck or hand, they're kinda in a separate pile.
