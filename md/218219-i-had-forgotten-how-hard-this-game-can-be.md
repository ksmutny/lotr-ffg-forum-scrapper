Hi all

So I hadn't played for a long while due to xwing store championship season and finally got round to get my cards back out again last night

I've decided to play the quests in order with only the released cards at the time the quest was released available and I've got to say, I had forgotten how brutal the core set quests were with core set only core cards!

Darn orcs

Although it could be that my deck building is a little rusty...

The bigger the card pool the easier it seems the core quests get. However.. I feel no matter how massive the choices of the player cards get Escape from Dol Guldur will always be brutal.
