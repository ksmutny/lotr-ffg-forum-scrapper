Easy mode removes all Gold indicated cards, but Gandalfs Delay and The Ring Draws them are Red. Do I remove these cards for easy mode or are they part of the Campaign?

They are part of the campaign. Only the gold (I would have say orange but it doesn't matter) should be removed.

Have fun!

The gold-ringed cards have the gold ring around their set indicator, which is in the right-center of the card.
