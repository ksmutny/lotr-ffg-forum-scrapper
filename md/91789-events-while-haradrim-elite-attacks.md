When Haradrim Elite [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/heirs-of-numenor/haradrim-elite-hon]is revealed from encounter deck, you must do the forced (immediate attack).

In faq1.5 the new rule is:

 

(1.26) Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase If an enemy attacks outside of the combat phase, it is still dealt a shadow card at the beginning of the attack. Then follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 "Combat" in the rules. Any shadow cards dealt to the attacking enemy are discarded after the attack resolves.

 

So you can play actions inside the 4 steps of combat phase.

 

So, for example, yesterday i was playing with Bard, he was ready when in quest phase Haradrim Elite was revealed. After it dealt a shadow card, i played Hands Upon the Bow [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/shadow-and-flame/hands-upon-the-bow-saf], and i killed Elite before it attacked. Is it correct? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, sounds fine to me.

I was just looking at the FAQ and found this:

 
"Q: When an enemy makes an attack as part of its
“when revealed” effect, is that enemy in the staging
area?
A: No. Enemies are added to the staging after resolving
their “when revealed” effects. An enemy that makes an
attack as part of its “when revealed” effect, is not in
the staging area or engaged with the defending player
unless a card effect says it is."
 
So-- oops!  Haradrim Elite are not in the staging area during their When Revealed attack, and therefore can't be targeted by Hands Upon the Bow, Hail of Stones, or other effects that target enemies in the staging area.

Good thing Haradrim Elite doesn´t have a When Revealed effect. And that the manner of it´s attack is spelled out pretty clear ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] :

Hah! Whoops.  Guess I should refresh my memory of the card first.

Hi .. yesterday we got a similar situation .. Haradrim Elite in reveald from the encounter deck and Bard wants to sniper via Hands upon a Bow .. question was .. does Bards -2 Defense ability be used to kill the Elite without any other card attached on him?

Hands Uppon the Bow doesn't give you a "ranged" attack. The bonus of Bard is only for "ranged" attack. So no.

I find it somehow weird that you wouldn't make a ranged attack with "hands upon the bow". Let me look at this from 2 perspectives.

1. Agree

 * The card just says to declare an attack, so it is just an attack against an enemy in the staging area. No reason to see this as a ranged attack.

2. Disagree

 * You need to declare a character with ranged. (It already starts leaning towards something where you need ranged for) 
 * The card is named "hands upon the bow": So I'm preparing my bow to shoot at someone, but I will hit him in a way where I didn't shoot the arrow? Or did I just fire the arrow but this is not considered to be a ranged attack? According to any theme this makes no sense at all.
    
 * But what about Dunhere and Haldir?
   
   - Dunhere: He's a horse-rider, a men of the West-fold, they have spears and such. Of course would it be able to attack enemies from some distance away.
   -Haldir: He's a ranger (and a scout), he knows how to hide. He can sneak towards enemies without them expecting anything and slit their throat. 
   
   Theme wise it isn't that strange that these guys don't make ranged attacks during their actions.
   
   One funny down-side to this approach (for theme speaking)

How would he hold that bow ??

 

 

For now adapting my plays accordingly, but hope that something gets revised on this because I think it absolutely makes no sense that a card called "Hands upon the Bow" doesn't imply a ranged attack....

Yeah, agree, it's a case where theme and rules clash.  They simply could have written "make a ranged attack," but for whatever reason opted not to.  It is what it is, certainly not worth an errata in my opinion.

The encounter card says they attack from the staging area - so isnt Mndela correct by being able to use "hands apon the bow" to kill them ?

otherwise card would just say they make an immediate attack ?

Yeah, that was settled... in October 2013! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Bit of threadcromancy going on here, gotta read all the posts and check the date.
