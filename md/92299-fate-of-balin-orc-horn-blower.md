The Fate of Balin [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/the-fate-of-balin-kd] has the next forced text: Forced: At the end of the staging step, reveal the top X cards of the encounter deck, adding all enemies to the staging area. Discard the other revealed cards without resolving them. X is the number of players.

 

If one of these revealed cards is Orc Horn Blower [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/khazad-dum/orc-horn-blower-kd], must you resolve the surge trait and "when revealed" condition? And, if these next cards are locations or threacheries..., must you place the locations to the staging as normally and resolve treacheries effects?

you do not resolve any cards or their effects other than enemies

only enemies are added, and only their effects come into play. so the horn blower would trigger as they are 'revealed'

 

as for surge i would say it also triggers as you are doing this in the staging step- this is where surge triggers

see here for a previous discussion
