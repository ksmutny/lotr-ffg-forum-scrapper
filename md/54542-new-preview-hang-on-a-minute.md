Is it just me or did FFG just skip any type of PreView on the "Return to Mirkwood" AP?

Feels a little wierd.... it's supposedly the last in the Mirkwood cycle and I was expecting it to showcase soon. But now we got Kazad-Dum and next cycle coming up on previews already. What's up with that?

We should get a Dead Marshes article before a Return to Mirkwood article.  I have a feeling the Dead Marshes will get an article later this week or at the beginning of the next.

Sure. But we already have a Dead Marshes [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2707] PreView... there might be a second one though I don't know.

 We got 3 Hills of Emyn Muil previews the 3 weeks before it was released, and something similar with all the previous AP's.  I don't know why FFG would change their advertising tactic now.  We got the Return to Mirkwood product announcement, now we'll have to wait until after Dead Marshes is released to get any more previews of it.  I bet we won't see anything else about The Redhorn Gate until after Kazad-dum is released.

I don't know why, but it feels like they just did.

There are two kinds of previews. One about half a year before the relelase, the product announcement. And one or more shortly before the release. We had a few of these for Emyn Muil recently, and the first ones for Khazad-dum and Redhorn Gate.

The announcement for "Dead Marshes" was on the 6th of June. You can still find it in the news section.

oops, wrong one. Return to Mirkwood was announced 14th of July.

 Also, the guy that puts these previews up is not part of the design team.

 He's probably in the marketing department.

 Maybe they plan on overlapping the release of the products??

 

So you can buy the new products while waiting for the end of the first cycle??

Khazad-dum was previewed before the recent Dead Marshes article, so maybe they're just doing some random stuff over there.
