Hi, a little question? Can I use action between defensive phase and attack phase or I must use action after?

So is like this?

Player actions

Defensive phase

Attack phase

Player actions

or this?

Player actions

Defensive phase

Player actions

Attack phase

 Kaybee is correct.  The other diagram is also correct, although in less detail.  Actions may be played between defense and attack, and indeed, at any time between combat steps.
