Order both. Not knowing what you'll get with the package makes it much more exciting. Don't you think?

 

Maybe FFG got their hands trapped with too many releases for this end of the year…

can only afford one…….that excitement becomes a headache when you realise you have to wait a month after everyone else for it to get to europe, and even worse when you ve ordered the wrong one, so i really want to pick the first one

I think a few days back rich, someone mentioned  Hobbit 2 was put back to Q1 2013 and HON is here this month. Going on that info i would go for HON (depending that info is correct).
