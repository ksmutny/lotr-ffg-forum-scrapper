When you're just starting the game and setting up the staging area, and the adventure says 'draw 1 card per hero', do you just use enemies and locations, or are all treachery cards triggered also, because triggering treachery cards before you can even play anything seems pretty random.  Just curious.

 

Thanks.

Yes, if a treachery card is revealed during setup, you have to resolve its effects.

Which adventure tells you to "draw 1 card per hero"? I am not familiar with any of the quests which say that...

 

Perhaps you meant to say, "Reveal and add one encounter card per player." Per hero would be a crazy set-up.

Oh, derp, Kyrie, yes that's what I meant to say. Per Player.  Per hero would be downright zany.
