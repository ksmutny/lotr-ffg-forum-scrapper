So, firstly I am new here. But anyway, let's get straight to the topic.

 

Do you think that at Gen Con there will be a new announcement regarding new deluxe expansion for LotR or anything else that has not yet been announced?

 

Why do I think this way?

 

I checked all the news for LotR and came to this conclusion:

- Khazad Dum, Heris of Numenor and Voice of Isengard were all announced in August or September (2011, 2012 and 2013).

- At that time 3 or 4 adventure packs of the matching cycle were released.

 

So what do you guys think? It would really be awesome if we would get info on a new deluxe expansion (Northern kingdom would be awesome). Despite all this, I very much doubt we will se anything new.

Not sure.. FFG always hold something back to surprise everyone.. but more often than not everything is per-advertised so they can sell a **** ton of stuff.

Basically your guess is as good as mine.. but I am going to go with no.

I think that the next deluxe expansion will be announced. I also think that Trouble in Tharbad will be available for purchase along with The Old Forest and if we're lucky The Ring Goes South.

Last year Voice of Isenguard was announced at GenCon and the box art was spoiled.

Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if they had the Road Darkens.  If I recall correctly, Black Riders was also "at the printers" during Gen Con last year.  Hopefully they announce the next deluxe expansion too.

haha, i meant is there any product called "the ring goes south" - i'm assuming that was just an error.

Now you're nitpicking.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Well, I suppose the first quest is called The Ring Goes South, so close enough...

Dunedain or Dale Deluxe maybe, or just the 3rd part of the Saga.
