When an Objective Card with an Encounter Card attached is returned to the Encounter Deck, what happens to the Encounter Card?

 

Is it also returned to the Encounter Deck?

 

Or is it discarded?

 

Or does it remain in the Staging area?

 

When I have a rule discrepancy, I always pick the toughest option for me, so I have been leaving the Encounter Card in the Staging Area.

 

Have I been playing correctly?

 

Thanks for any help!

Pretty sure it stays in the staging area.

Gah!!! Not the answer I was hoping for!!! But I suspected my hunch was correct.

 

Thanks for the reply.

That's the Golden Rule of LotR.
