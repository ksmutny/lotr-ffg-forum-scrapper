Is it OK to pay two resources to ready the Warden more than once per round?  Say I've got 4 lore resources available -- I would like to use him in 2 different action windows to heal twice... not sure if thats legal....

It is legal. Cards do what is wrote on there. Each time you activate warden of healing you can ready it for 2 lore resources.

Thats fantastic -- I don't think I will ever use the Daughter of Nimrodel again!

You're not alone there.  There are very few decks on ringsdb that use Daughter of Nimrodel, another card for Long Dark, but *not* Warden of Healing.  They are:

Several of these are for thematic reasons.  There's 66 decks that include *both* Warden of Healing and Daughter of Nimrodel, for those situations when three 1-hp healers just aren't enough.

I believe Warden is the second most popular Lore card at ringsdb, behind only Daeron's Runes.

Very true, the only times I use Daughter now is in a Gloin deck that needs to get Gloin damaged to get resources and heal him up. Even then though, you are probably using Elrond since you want to heal and if you are using Elrond, Warden becomes insane (as in more insane than it already was).

Many people claim that Warden of Healing is more useful than Daughter of Nimrodel, but I actually take the opposite stance.  I have 3x Core Sets and Daughter of Nimrodel makes a fantastic proxy for Warden of Healing.  That's pretty useful if I do say so myself <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]
