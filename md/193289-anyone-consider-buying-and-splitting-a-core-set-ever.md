# [Anyone consider buying and splitting a core set ever?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193289-anyone-consider-buying-and-splitting-a-core-set-ever/)

First off, for me Im UK based if this idea goes anywhere.

Just wondering if this idea has legs.

Id like a full playset but buying a third core would have ridiculous duplication levels. Ebay/Amazon has sellers with the coreX1 sets but they are about £20 and the core itself is only £25.

So are there enough separate sections in a core for multiple buyers to get a good deal?

My thoughts:

1: X1 card set (for me please)

2: X2 card set (for those wanting to boost without second core)

3: Remaining card sets (lower value other than multiple deck builds)

4: counters/dials (usefull)

5: encounter sets ( very useful for those making ready-to-run decks or separate nightmare decks)

Five separate chunks (biggest chunk gets the box posted there)

Are they interesting enough to be able to properly split a core set between multiple peoples? (Secondary postage needs adding too)

Interested in thoughts.

Alex

(Ps if FFG did a coreX1 pod id buy it, but they dont)

I don't really understand it, but I'm Netherlands, so it wouldn't work anyway.

Its basically the idea of splitting up the contents of the core set and splitting up the cost. Everybody gets stuff cheaper. Just depends on if there is enough people wanting each of the various bits.

I just think it'd be hard to find someone who doesn't want what you want. The only people who would need the cards that come as doubles would likely be people with only one core currently but they'd be missing out on the singles out of their second core which are one of the biggest reasons to get another in the first place, since they are generally some of the "best" cards in the core.

Agreed yes.

I think the biggest possibility is people wanting to build additional encounter sets or nightmare sets.

 

Sad thing is that the singles set is only about 15 cards. I find it difficult to spend £20 (ebay) on just that many cards but then also a full set for £25 is better but so much wastage.

This. You can use the other cards as proxies, or to use as regular back when shuffling nightmare in.

 

Alex, the only thing I can think of is: take the cards you already have more than 3. Scan and print 1 copy each of the cards you need. Glue the printed cards on the regular cards you're not using. Et voila, same backs, so that you don't know what you're drawing, and target reached without spending a penny (I honestly think you've already shown your love for the LCG universe enough not to blame you if you homeprint a few cards)

Julia urging me to save money?....... what fiendishly good game are you about to carefully drop into conversation with me and watch my wallet panic ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'm afraid it's not about some criptic game, it's just about the value of an additional core set, which is extremely low even when you get everything for yourself, not to mention lack of one when you're splitting those little things that are left after.

I know, it was a joke, hence the wink-smiley :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
