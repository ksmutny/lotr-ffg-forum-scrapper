 Hi all,

We played a 4-player Foundations of Stone game, and while I think we did very well, a few rules questions came up that I couldn't find the answer to.


Basically, it all revolves around when the party gets split up, and the First Player.  Clearly, there is one First Player, but for the purposes of the other players (non-Firsts) who are on their own… who counts as the First Player then?
 

 

Example:
Player A is the First Player.
Player C plays an Ancient Mathom on a location at his quest, and explores the location.  Who draws the three cards?  It really shouldn't be player A, since they aren't even in the same "universe" as far as the game is concerned… but it does create other issues.


Likewise, who would put cards under a Nameless that engages Player D?

These questions get asked again if Player B and Player D "join" each other… and neither of them are the First Player.

I could go on, but I think that's it for now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 Just a follow up…

 

I did see the answers related to this that were posted in an earlier thread, but they don't address the question completely.

Players A, B, C, and D (sitting clockwise in this order) are separated at their own quests.

Player A is the First Player.

Player C is his own First Player, and player D is his own first player.  They end up joining up.  Who is the First Player?

At the end of the round, the First Player marker passes to Player B, who is still on his own.

In the pairing of Players C & D, who is the First Player?  Does it continue to be the first player in their group clockwise from the First Player?  (thus creating the situation where Player C is potentially considered a First Player for three rounds in a row)

 

Thanks again.

 The official answer is:

Good question. When players C & D combine their staging areas, the first player
will be the first in line. So, player C will be the first player in that shared
game until the first player token is passed to player D.

 

Ok, so to be clear:

 

Round 1:

Player A - First & Last Player with FP Token
Player B - First & Last Player
Player C - First & Last Player
Player D - First & Last Player

Round 1: After Players C & D join

Player A - First & Last Player with FP Token
Player B - First & Last Player
Player C - First Player
Player D - Last Player

Round 2:

Player A - First & Last Player
Player B - First & Last Player with FP Token
Player C - First Player
Player D - Last Player

Round 3:

Player A - First & Last Player
Player B - First & Last Player
Player C - First Player with FP Token
Player D - Last Player

Round 4:

Player A - First & Last Player
Player B - First & Last Player
Player C - Last Player
Player D - First Player with FP Token

On subsequent rounds (assuming that more players don't actually join up) Player C will be considered First Player for three more rounds in a row.
