Had a good one today.   Player was at 49 threat with Favor of the Valar attached to their threat dial.   Card revealed was Outlying Homestead.

Player eliminated?

Ooh, I'm actually not sure if it was only just revealed - IIRC, When revealed effects and keywords go off before the card actually enters the staging area, so when the Doomed 1 happens, the Homestead is not in staging yet and you're still allowed to reduce your threat with FotV.

That's correct.

 

It's still strange though. The phrase "You are not eliminated" does not depend on the actual lowering of the threat. So what if there was already one in the staging area when a doomed card got revealed?

^  Haha.   Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.   So assuming that was the case, theoretically you could stack threat forever, because you're eliminated when your threat crosses the 50 threshold, the game doesn't necessarily specify what happens afterward.   

Although of course that's nitpicking,  the point is that it's not entirely clear what is supposed to happen afterward.  Eliminated again at every instance of threat increase beyond 50?  Seems logical,  but not written down anywhere.

Also logical would be to presume that the writers meant that you're only not eliminated with Favor of the Valar if your threat ends up being below 50, although the phrasing on the card does not give that impression.

Well, whether you can lower your threat or not, you're still forced to discard Favour of the Valar, at which point its text is inactive and since your threat is then still over the elimination level, you are then eliminated.

2 suggestions : Thror's key (such an underused card) or Saruman.

Saruman raise threat too, so the Saruman idea is not as good as Thrors Key.

 

Just remembered a thing...

Saruman with Favor means threat lowering...

Valar likes the White wizard!
