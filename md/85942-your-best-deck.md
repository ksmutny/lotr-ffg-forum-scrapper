I thought it would be a good idea to have a thread discussing all your favorite or best decks in the game. It doesn't have to be "best" as in being able to beat the most quests, if it's a thematic deck that you really enjoy playing, then go ahead and share it. If it can beat every quest with ease, I also urge you to share it, as I'm sure we'd all be fascinated. Just as an example, since I'm writing this quickly, I really enjoy playing with the Gondor deck that FFG posted a while ago in Second Breakfast:

 
Heroes
Boromir (Heirs of Númenor, 2)
Aragorn (Core Set, 1)
Beregond (Heirs of Númenor, 1)
 
Allies
Citadel Custodian x3 
Defender of Rammas x3 
Errand-rider x3 
Envoy of Pelargir x3 
Faramir x2
Gandalf (Core Set, 73) x3
Gondorian Spearman x3
Guard of the Citadel x3
 
Attachments
Celebrían’s Stone x1
Citadel Plate x1 
Gondorian Shield (The Steward’s Fear, 5) x3 
Horn of Gondor x1 
Spear of the Citadel x3 
Steward of Gondor x2 
Sword that was Broken (The Watcher in the Water, 55) x2
 
Events
Behind Strong Walls x3 
Ever Vigilant x2 
Goblin-cleaver (The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill, 16) x2
Sneak Attack x2 
Valiant Sacrifice x2
Wealth of Gondor x3

This is my Spirit Tactics Deck. It's one of the decks I enjoy playing the most (because it's fun and because you can defeat pretty much every scenario maybe except the battle of laketown and escape from dol guldur). Since the silvan tracker was released it has become really powerful. So this is the standard version (I generally swap a few cards for every different scenario even though this is one of the decks that needs that the least) but you might add shadow of the past instead of horn of gondor, or eagles (if you need to play against battle/siege sceanrios) instead of 1 dwarven tomb, 1 west road traveller and other 3x cards. The strategy is easy but it can be tricky because you're not always supposed to play every card as you draw it (in fact you need to save some resources in the early turns if you can). If you have at least one weapon and foe hammer you'll very likely draw 3+ cards every turn, you'll need the dwarven tomb to fetch elrond's counsel from the discard pile (or a test of will if you feel treachery cards can be your doom). You have a lot of willpower almost always from turn one (cause you can get a silvan tracker and an envoy of pelargir) + hama and glorfindel you'll have 7 WP (and legolas that progress while killing). when you get Gandalf out all you have to do if beware of your theat. the rest will be up to him (especially defense). Attack is one of this deck's best feat, as you'll be a real orc slayer (with 3 blade of gondolin) but you'll deal a good amount of damage to anyone (3 atk heroes + gandalf + rivendell blade x2 + 6 1 atk allies...and black arrow deals the final blow to any boss). The deck is very cheap (only 2, 1 and 0 cost cards except for gandalf). try it out if you like.

## 3 [richsabre on July 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=809555)

i have 3. the first is the one i am most famous for and my favourite thematically. it changes often so there will be more cards than usual, but here is the general idea..

 

The Flight To the Ford

 

Strider (lore)

Frodo

Glorfindel (spirit)

 

stargazer

gildor

mirkwood runners

riversong

arwen

northern tracker

haldir

 

asfaloth

light of valinor

good meal

fast hitch

burning brand (if not hasty stroke)

mathom

ranger spikes

song of wisdom

 

striders path

test of will

hasty stroke (if no brand)

elronds counsel

dwarven tomb

dearons runes

o elbereth gilthoniel

 

general idea is using frodo s ability with glorfindels low start threat and striders threat reset. generally its a theme deck but i (and others) have had good use with it in solo. its also a great paired deck with a tactics killing deck.

 

the 2nd is my killing deck. again cards will change...this is just off the top of my head

 

unnamed

 

Hama / Beorn / Legolas

 

vassel

winged guardian

eagles of misty mountains

watcher of the bruinen

trollshaw scout

bofur tactics

 

support of the eagles

rivendell/gondolin blades

yew bow

black arrows

rivendell bow

 

feint

thicket of spears

straight shot

goblin cleaver

foe hammer

quick strike

hands upon the bow

 

strategy is keep hama recycling feint/thicket. beorn sentinels another questing decks enemies and some of the weaker ones that cannot be feinted. legolas hits across the table and hama helps with other enemies.

 

3rd one is one i posted last night about winning the stewards fear....im proud to say me and a friend got an old style score of -3 on the quest.

 

The Alliance

 

theodred

glorfindel

bifur

 

gildor

erestor

arwen

riversong

northern tracker

gleowine

faramir

gandalf

elfhelm

 

resourceful

steward

asfaloth

light of valinor

 

risk some light

test of will

tomb

dearons runes

wealth of lorien

elronds counsel

will of the west

sneak attack

timely aid

@Rich - You made up the Flight to the Ford deck?  I thought it was just a popular deck that was easy to think of with the Hero combo.

> @Rich - You made up the Flight to the Ford deck?  I thought it was just a popular deck that was easy to think of with the Hero combo.  

thats a tough one for me to answer. i think it would be rather arrogant of me to say 'yes i was the first to make the deck'.

....rather, i undoubtedly came up with the name for the deck as i was the first to use it, and was certainly one of the first to make it after strider came out

i remember posting on the spoiler thread about the deck's potential as reset deck, but it was quite a while afterwards that i posted about it in the strategy section

...but as you say, its a great hero combination that many have utilized since strider came out. i just thought up that theme of frodo being saved from the black riders by strider and glorfindel in the fellowship

i dont have the deck list since i usually make new decks by the day but the combination that i've felt was the strongest was Glorfindel-Frodo-Elrond.  Runs similar to the "flight to the ford" deck listed above but just substitutes Aragron for Elrond and his vilya-awesomeness.  The much discussed Dain-Thorin-Ori deck is also incredibly powerful as well...if there were tiers of decks id def put them both in the top

## 7 [Alex6222 on July 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=809647)

I have several decks that have been very successful. My most successful Dwarf deck is Thorin, Ori and Oin (yes i know that with Dain it would be 10 time better but i just don't want to use him). But the deck that i like to play the most is my Elven Alliance deck with Elrond, Glorfindel and Mirlonde which can beat all of the quests before HoN (where it royally sucks). Now the Outland deck is my weapon of choice against HoN and AtS.

## 8 [GrandSpleen on July 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=809650)

Here is my favorite pair of decks.  They're similar to the popular Thorin & Co. deck, but that deck packs all of the card drawing glory of the Dwarves into a single deck.  I tried that for awhile and used a tactics/spirit deck as a companion, but the second deck struggled to draw cards.  When I built these, I wanted to split up the card draw between two players.  Over time we've modified it a bit to give it some utility and make it viable for many scenarios.  It won't win every quest, but we've beaten a good portion of them!

Thanks for all the replies! There are some VERY cool decks on here. GrandSpleen, I actually just made something similar to your Legolas and the Dwarves deck, and discovered the power of combining elf weapons and dwarf ferocity. A powerful combination.

Yes.  As I mentioned in another thread, I can't get away from that Rivendell Blade.  I am also really enjoying Mighty Prowess recently.  I want to try to put something together to really take advantage of that card-- thinking Legolas (as standard attacker) and Boromir (for self-readying ability) for massive damage-plunking ability, and Strider to manage Boromir's threat.

Hey Rich,

In your mono tactics fighting deck did you fail to include Gandalf or did you purposely leave him out because you wouldn't have enough resources if you were recyling "Thicket of Spears" all the time?

## 13 [Ithilien Ranger on August 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=843332)

I currently enjoy playing "The Steward, the King and the Pip", consisting of Leadership Aragorn, Faramir and Pippin (Lore). 

 

I use a bunch of trap cards and Ithilien Archers/ Trackers with Ranger Bow. To pay for it I have Steward of Gondor which will go on Faramir. Pippin helps with card draw (his own ability plus Mithrandir's Advice, Daeron's Runes etc). I opted for Leadership Aragorn over Lore due to the Sneak Attack & Gandalf combo, resource generation and Fresh Tracks - a card that works wonders in combination with the direct damage offered by Forest Patrol and Ranger Bow. 

The main reason to go with Leadership was Willpower. Sword that was Broken helps me cope with the biggest weakness I found in Ranger decks (Willpower). Celebrian's Stone further grants access to Spirit, so I usually include A Test of Will and Unexpected Courage in my deck. 

I'm still playing with the idea of adding Tactics as well. Great Yew Bow and Hands upon the Bow are simply so much fun with Faramir!

well i used to include gandalf in almost all my decks in core era, but more and more i see little need for him in my decks as there are cheaper ways to do what he can...unless you have sneak attack

so yes, partly becuase of lack of reources, but also because mono tactics allows no sneak attack, and to have gandalf in a deck i think you really need that card to make the 3 slots worth it

sometimes i will have 1 copy just for themeatic sake ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I usually build for 2-4 player games and this deck has always gone the distance. There have been small changes here and there through the years but I can say Legolas has been leading the way since Core. Hama and Beregond replaced the brothers when HoN came out and the attachments have cycled in and out as needed. 

The deck is all about the heroes. Giving them swords and shields and relying on eagles to lend support.

One of my most powerful decks, which I haven't seen anyone else use, is Strider/Boromir(Tactics)/Bilbo. Bilbo can be exchanged for mirlonde Denethor or Beregond But what's important is the strider, tactics Boromir combo. The basic idea is to beef up Boromir into a killing machine(Gondorian Fire helps a lot) And using him as many times as you need to before lowering your threat with Strider. This is especially powerful against HoN quests which are really tough at the beginning.

## 18 [Rainelotr on August 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=854210)

That's a great idea Narsil. I use Boromir ALL the time and I don't think I've tried that combo before.

 

My fav two decks are 1st, a Palantir focused variation on the Flight to the Ford deck -( I have my own deck but use the same hero combo - it's just obscenely effective.) and one of the Trained for War decks out there. I've made a half dozen easily. Just love playing mono tactics

## 19 [Bullroarer Took on August 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85942-your-best-deck/?do=findComment&comment=854228)

I use Strider with Boromir and add Spirit Glorifindel in for good measure.  The deck can take a few turns to get going, but then it is unstoppable.  Access to Spirit gives more threat reduction and treachery cancelation and Arwen.  Boromir loves him some Arwen.

> One of my most powerful decks, which I haven't seen anyone else use, is Strider/Boromir(Tactics)/Bilbo. Bilbo can be exchanged for mirlonde Denethor or Beregond But what's important is the strider, tactics Boromir combo. The basic idea is to beef up Boromir into a killing machine(Gondorian Fire helps a lot) And using him as many times as you need to before lowering your threat with Strider. This is especially powerful against HoN quests which are really tough at the beginning.

 

Other use of this combo is making Boromir the allaround defender... if you can give him "A Burning Brand" even better...

Burning Brand can only go to Lore characters.

 

Anyway, my best deck so far is a secrecy Strider + Spirit Glorfindel:

 

Glorfindel (FoS) x1
Aragorn (TWitW) x1
 
 
Ally (14)
Arwen Undomiel (TWitW) x1
Imladris Stargazer (FoS) x1
Daughter of the Nimrodel (Core) x2
Gildor Inglorion (THoEM) x1
Haldir of Lorien (AJtR) x1
Henamarth Riversong (Core) x1
Ithilien Archer (EaAD) x1
Ithilien Tracker (HON) x2
Master of the Forge (SaF) x2
Warden of Healing (TLD) x1
Gandalf (Core) x1
 
 
Attachment (20)
Light of Valinor (FoS) x3
Unexpected Courage (Core) x3
Ranger Spikes (HON) x3
A Burning Brand (CatC) x2
Asfaloth (FoS) x2
Ranger Bow (AoO) x2
Resourceful (TWitW) x3
Song of Travel (THoEM) x1
Song of Wisdom (CatC) x1
 
 
Event (18)
A Test of Will (Core) x3
Dwarven Tomb (Core) x1
Elrond's Counsel (TWitW) x3
The Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x1
Risk Some Light (SaF) x3
Daeron's Runes (FoS) x3
Will of the West (Core) x1
Lorien's Wealth (Core) x2
Out of Sight (TLD) x1
 
It's fun, very thematic, and very versatile.  Questing is taken care of by Glorfindel (with Light of Valinor and Asfaloth, he's awesome), and defense is Strider (with burning brand, Arwen and UC, he's awesome).  Attack is taken care of by both once they get the attachments for it.  Ithilien tracker, archer, ranger bows and ranger spikes handle the staging area.  Elrond's council and Galadhrim's Greeting handle threat (and buff Glorfindel), and if my threat gets too high, Strider resets it back to 17.  Lorien's Wealth, Stargazer, Forgemaster and Daeron's Runes handle card draw needs.  Test of Will and Risk some light handle the encounter deck.  Daughters and Warden handle healing needs.  This deck is not mega-strong in any category, but instead is highly flexible and responsive to the quest dangers at hand.

My best deck runs Thorin, Bombur, and Ori. The idea is to play a single dwarf on turn one who costs either 1 or 2 lore resource. Second turn you are already drawing an additional card and Thorin is gaining an additional resource. From there it is an ally slaughter fest as you draw your deck quickly and play lots of things. I have my best win ratio with this deck! If anyone wants the actual itemized list, I will post it.

As someone that just started working on a Dwarf deck, I'd very much like to see what you came up with.

I ran a deck like this for a while, too, with Thorin, Ori and Bombur.  It's fast, versatile, and full of dwarves!  Just one dwarf ally and you've got double resources and card draw at the same time.  And sneak-attack Longbeard Orcslayer is lots of orc-slashing fun.  I found it wrecks many a quest.

My favorite deck is my Songs Deck.  It needs a little help getting started sometimes, but it can be a real powerhouse as well as a thematic blast!

I made a video session of this deck vs. Road to Rivendell:
