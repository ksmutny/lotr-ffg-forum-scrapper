Here is a link to my first custom scenario: www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80217/shadows-over-halifiriendifficulty-6-custom-scenari [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/80217/shadows-over-halifiriendifficulty-6-custom-scenari]
 

After the Battle of the Hornburg it has passed three days since Gandalf rode off to Minas Tirith, until you are rested enough to follow. Just short of Firien Wood you are surprised by a pelting rain and ride towards shelter of the woods…


This quest requires the core set, Khazad-Dum and Road to Rivendell expansions. It has been tested with 2 players.
I have tried to make some Scenario design goals (see below)
 

Scenario design goals:
• Scale with 1-4 players
• Enemy progress as factor
• Boss fight at the end
• Accurate Middle earth information, connection to the movies
• Base adventure on a partly on an exciting adventure pack.

I shall be fun to hear what you think.
