Call me silly but in over a year of playing the game, I'd never included Common Cause into any of my decks until recently. And (not surprisingly to those who had) I was surprised how effective it can be. Of course it doesn't fit every deck but in my deck with Boromir it was very useful to give Legolas another go, or to ready Beravor on the other side of the board. I just felt like sharing and was wondering whether others have had luck with this card…

the problem with common cause for me (and this will probably be different in mulit play) is that each of my heros each round is designated to do 1 specific task and so they (if i am doing my job right) should already be ready for when i need them……obviously with just having 3 heros this means that come the attack phase, ill have already used  my quester, my defender and should have my attacker ready

common cause sort of feels like your wasting 1/3 of your heros to just wait around to ready another, when they could be put to better uses

As I said, it is only probably good with some Heroes. Boromir can always be used if needed - for Beravor, for instance. Imrahil has also often stood ready without need in some of my games. Eleanor can be another good target, or an attacker if no enemies show up. But then there are those (and a majority I feel) that are always busy.

If Beravor is on the board, it is a great card to have around for the player with Dain (or other battle oriented characters). There is usually a turn every so often where there are not enough enemies to fight on every board, on those turns you can effectively get 2 card draws for the price of 1 card and no resources. That is a decent deal.

Early on Common Cause made it into my decks for this reason, but I generally find something better to do with my card slots now.

 Common Cause was really useful in my Three Hunters deck against Conflict at the Carrock. After getting Steward of Gondor on Aragorn, I would use him to quest and ready him by spending a resource every round. When Common Cause came up, I could ready my powered-up Gimli to attack the trolls.
