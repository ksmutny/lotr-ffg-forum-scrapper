I've recently discovered the joy of LotR LCG. Im really interested in collecting all the content but sadly it seems that its night on impossible to collect a lot of it unless your willing to get ripped off at the cost. For instance trying to find "The Hunt for Gollum seems next to impossible. ONe retailer has a copy availible but he wants £90 for it!! I love the game but there are certain practical considerations lol. 

 

 

So tldr: when will we see a reprint of mirkwood and khazakdum stuff (if ever)

 

 Edit* Just realized i missed a great chance to name this thread, "The Hunt for, The Hunt for Gollum".

Yea, they're doing a big reprint run very soon it seems.
