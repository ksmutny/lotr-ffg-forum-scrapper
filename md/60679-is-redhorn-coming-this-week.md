In Germany it's expected to be released in the end of February, i.e. start of next week.

In answer to the subject of this thread: "OH PLEASE GOD, I HOPE SO!"

Ahem. Xmas seems to have knocked everything out as far as getting these things in the UK. I remember that Return to Mirkwood was released a mere four days here after FFG announced it going on sale, and it was the same for AGoT too, but since then they've kinda ground to a halt, with three weeks or more between the US and UK releases of the new Warhammer battle pack. Hopefully, if it is announced either later this week or early next week, it won't be the middle of March before it arrives on British soil...

I'm in no rush for redhorn gate... as this is not a pvp game I feel no rush to try and get the best card pool to make awesome decks to crush my mates at the local game store.. instead I enjoy just making my way though , and I feel that FFG is releasing these far to quick. I know people that have only played some quest like 2 times or something.. in some cases not even once. I know I personally have hardly even scratched the surface of Kaz. I haven't even had time to try the last quest and have only just got near 100% win ratio decks on the 1st 2.. and then I am only using "simple" decks.. I still belive I have barly scratched the surface of 1 single combo (ziggy) let alone experimented with some of the other things possible in lhaz... I think that while I enjoy this game it is easy to get caught up in FFGs release schedule that is designed to milk as much money as possible and forget that just cause it exists dose not mmean you need to buy it instantly.

Seeing as I still have eight games left of 7th Level, then 10 of Flight from Moria (and probably 10 of Osgiliath), not in a hurry myself.

OT, but first impressions of 7th Level make me think whoever listed it as difficulty 3 was smoking the same stuff the person rating Carrock a 7 was. Seriously, didn't have a single progress token on 1B at the end of the game! Started with 9 threat in the staging area, Goblin Scout, Orc Horn Blower (surge + When Revealed, thank you very much), Goblin Spearman, Goblin Tunnels, with heroes barely putting out 10 willpower for the first turn thanks to Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn. Managed to Forest Snare both Cave Trolls, but got mauled by having to always defend against the KD orcs who autokill you with undefended attacks.
