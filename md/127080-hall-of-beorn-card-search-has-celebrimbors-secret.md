Yea, I'm getting a lot of broken images. We're getting "access denied", so I'm guessing it is just a permissions thing.

It is simple - those pictures are from FFG site, he didn't scan other onesÂ  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Probably busy or something else...

Dedalus is correct, I haven't had time to scan any images. I just wanted to get the text spoilers up as quickly as possible. I will go back and add the images when I can.

after a long time with few releases, they're just coming thick and fast now...at this rate, I don't have time to play them! Between the POD stuff I ordered the other day and just ordering this, i've got 8 quests in the post, and I've only had time to play the last one once so far. Not that I object to lots of stuff being released, but maybe they could spread them out over the year a bit better next year, as we seemed to have little for months and then be racing through releases.
