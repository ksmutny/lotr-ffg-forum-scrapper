Hi,

 

If I make all the heroes and allies to the quest, which I don't have any character to attack or defend,

DO the enemy still engage?

Do the enemy attack the exhausted character?

Do the enemy attack the player directly?

 

---------

If there are two enemies attacking ONE Hero/Ally Do they BOTH attack him/her? or can ONE enemy attack only?

Thanks,

The bad news is that the readiness of your characters generally has nothing to do with the engagement behavior or attack behavior of the enemies.

So, even if all you heroes/allies are exhausted then enemies will still engage based on the standard threat value check.

And, regardless of whether you have heroes/allies ready every single enemy engaged with you will attack.

Since only characters that are ready can defend, if you have too many enemies engaged then you will likely suffer undefended attacks (a very bad thing). Read carefully through the section on "Resolving Enemy Attacks" on page 18 of the rules.

Hi, 

 

Thanks this was very helpful, 

There is one thing that I am confused and it's not in the rule book,

If heroes/allies are exhausted in Quest Phase, When in Combat Phase (Which there are no one to defend and no one to take undefended attacks)

do enemies attack the player directly than level up the threat value?  

do enemies attack the exhausted heroes/allies that are in the quest?

or can enemies attack?

 

Thank you,

If you have heroes, there *is* someone to take undefended attacks.  Any hero can take an undefended attack; being ready is not necessary.

If there is no defender the attack is undefended. So when the attack resolve (so after the shadow) we deal all the attack value as damage to a hero. As we say it regularly kill a hero.

If you did not declare a character as a defender against an attack, then the attack automatically becomes undefended. In your case, since all of your heroes and allies are exhausted you have no option but to take an undefended attack.

An undefended attack does not take the form of increased threat. Instead, all damage from the enemy's attack is assigned directly to one of your heroes. The hero's defence value is not considered when assigning the damage. Thematically you can think about it as if the hero was caught off guard by the attack.

I second RichardPlunkett's suggestion to ready p18 of the rulebook, which describes undefended attacks.

Sometime it can be strategic to take an undefended attack, but usually it is wise to leave enough allies and heroes ready at the start of the combat phase to defend any attacks. Sending everyone to quest is very risky if enemies might be engaging you during the round.

Omg. I never knew this. I've played for about a year and been doing it wrong - I've been raising my threat instead on undefended attacks! (magic the gathering is ingrained in me) The correct version is much worse!

1. Is there a maximium on allies/attachments that can be attached to a hero?

2. Is it the normal don thing to commit all 3 heros to a quest?  (If one is left out can they still help?)

Wow this game seems tough - Im only on the first core adventure. Heeeelp!

An ally is not attached to anyone. He act as a hero (except for collecting resource, deal damage on undefended attacks and some others things like cards that specifically say hero).

There is no maximum of cards in play or in hand. A hero can only have 2 restricted cards (it virtually take a hand each) but can have how many you want of attachment without this trait. Like 3 unexpected courage, 1 celebrian stone, 1 steward of gondor...

Yes this game is really hard. And also very interesting ;). You usually keep people for attacking, depending deck it will be allies or heroes. In multiplayer some deck will send every heroes in quest and some others none and will do the fight for the whole table.
