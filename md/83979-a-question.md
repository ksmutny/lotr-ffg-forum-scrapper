Hello everybody,

 

Firstly I would like to apologize because I know there are many different threads regarding the question I will be exposing but I could not find any of them specifically solvinng my question. 

I am a fairly new player and I only own one Core set. Since I am loving the game so much, I am now looking to further expand my card pool and start doing some new quests and I am thinking about what's what I am going to buy next. While I have read in this forum that the best would be to follow the release order, I found that in the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle there seem to be lots of "Eagle" themed cards. My issue there is that I am not a big fan about eagles so I wanted to know if you would recommend me to go straight for the Khazad-Dum deluxe expansion.

Do you think I will be having an enjoyable experience with only one copy of the core and the deluxe expansion or I am going to struggle due to my limited card pool and overwhelming difficulty of the quests in the set?

 

Thank you so much in advance for your help; I really appreciate it!

 

Cheers

Hi,

I think you should be fine with core and khazad dum. khazad is almost exclusively dwarf orientated, so if you like them then great, if not you still need it to play any dwarrowdelf packs.

the dwarrowdelf cycle holds some of the most powerful cards in the game, so i would say if you really dont want to do mirkwood then go for that….perhaps get a few key mirkwood packs though?

for instance any dwarf deck you can make in khazad is expotentially better with dain (mirkwood 6), also you may want to try and get the song cards

Yeah, that sounds like a really good idea. I think I am going to love the dwarf theme :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I went for Khazad Dum before getting shadows of mirkwood myself (on the grounds that an initial influx of extra cards would be better for deck building).

 

It works, but I did feel (when I got shadows of Mirkwood after) that the game assumes you have all previous cards avaliable.

Really? I had non idea! that is good to know. I bought two core and the Kazad Dum expansion along with all the Shadows of Mirkwood but one (AP 6, funny enough). I would say that after getting all of them in one block, I found that the second core was the best thing for my card pool. So many  of the really good cards are in the core, and they just don't give you enough in a single core. But then, Rich is a single core guy and I'm sure he would have to disagree.

Barring the purchase of another core set,  I would have to echo Rich on this one. Buy AP 6 from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Also, take a look at the easy rules supplement (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4138 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4138]). This is a valuable rules set for people who are taking time building their card pool. WELCOME TO THE COMMUNITY!

Rather than Return to Mirkwood (or any of the Mirkwood packs), here's some alternative suggestions:

- The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill.  All the dwarf cards in this set which will complement the ones you get in KD, including 3 strong heroes in Thorin, Ori and Nori, will make up for the lack of Dain and overall give you a lot better value for your money.

- Dwarrowdelf cycle.  These adventures packs use the encounter sets from Khazad-Dum.  I particularly recommend Foundations of Stone and Watcher in the Water - both contain very strong player cards and good scenarios.
