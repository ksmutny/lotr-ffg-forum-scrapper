So, it's probably only me (or probably not), but I haven't seen this guy being mentioned past release, like ever. 

 

So, if anybody here is using him, or even better - has some stories involving him, could you share your experiences with us?

He's like Dori 0,5.

But better =/

Seems decent, but doomed cost of course is problematic and it is an ally, so you need to plan ahead on when to play him. Also thematically, I don't get how this guy is not an Ithilien ranger in green. I get that he may be a knight of the White Tower that was assigned a post in Henneth Annun, but it still feels out of place for me. A Tactics ranger would be interesting.

It's not a horrible card per se, but when would you play it? Stats alone are probably not worth it, 3 ressources means probably at least two tactics heroes, the timing of the ability is awkward (before staging, how to tell if you need him this round. Maybe I should try to throw one or two into a tactics deck, just to see how it works.

While the doomed cost is problematic, it's completely optional. And it's the lowest doomed cost possible. And the best part of his ability is that he can target anyone and anything with it, allies and heroes alike. He can benefit from Leadership Boromir, Visionary Leadership (useless though), Behind the Strong Walls, and Gondorian Discipline.

 

ossdrossmane, I would argue about stats. His stats are pretty decent in comparsion to other 3 costed Tactics guy. Not best or spectacular, but definetely decent at the very least.

he's okay.   But these days you cant waste card slots on "okay".

Decent, sure. But not really enough to pay three resources, is it? You can get two attack anywhere for two ressources, same for two defence. So you're paying for flexibility, or the ability. I don't hate the card, it's probably better than we give it credit for. I'm just not seeing the deck where I'd play him.

He's pretty good. Stats are nice just for the fact he's flexible between defence and offense, whereas most Tactics allies are focused on one or the other, and the Doomed can be useful sometimes. I think I'd mostly only play him in a mono-Tactics context where the cost really isn't an issue. He could also work pretty well in a Gondor deck though.

So sure, he's not an ally I trot out all the time, but he's good to bring out in the right context.

when i find a deck that could do some work, at the moment to discard cards down to 50, he always is out :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I have two copies of him in my Leadership/Tactics Gondor deck. He is a solid ally (3 attack with the boost from Boromir) and he can soak a point of archery, but I almost never use his optional Doomed effect. I am considering replacing him with the Knight of Minas Tirith as he just seems underwhelming.

I feel like I could write a two page post on why this guy is just okay, but it all goes back to the basic flawed structure of the game which I'm sure you're sick of hearing me talk about. So I'll shut up and say he's just ok.

Can you give at least the short version?

The short version is that he doesn't have 0 WP, 2 AT AND 2 DF, he has 0 WP, 2 AT OR 2 DF. But you are paying 3 resources as if it were AND.

Tactics has many amazing defenders, which gives him many alternatives.. I can think of some niche uses for him as well as thematic uses, Perhaps if a Doomed Gondor deck ever becomes a thing he'll actually stand out more. He's probably still pretty useful for players who have a smaller selection of cards. This guy would have been awesome in the Mirkwood cycle.

 

Bullroarer makes a point about how difficult it is to get both his stats to work, so only in quests that require flexability (say with plenty of battle keywords) can you get the most out of him.

Well, from the top of my head, the easiest way to make use of both of his stats - Behind the Strong Walls.

Good combo with Dori ^^. Dori + Unexpected courage giving +4 defense to Bombur+Brand by one side, and +4 defense to Erkenbrand by the other side.
