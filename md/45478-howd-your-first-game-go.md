# [How&#039;d your first game go?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/)

Finally got my copy and played through the first quest with Aragorn, Gloin, and Theordred. Gloin died off early as a sacrificial lamb due to low ally draw and high spider spam from the encounter deck. However, an early Steward of Gondor on Theodred was huge as I had enough resources not to miss Gloin for too long and get more allies out. Aragorn's power is amazing as he continued to advance quests and kill spiders in his spare time. The nail in the coffin for the Enemy was when I got Faramir out and was able to use his power, play the event card (can't remember the name now) that lets you stand an ally, and quest for a huge 8 willpower on the Chosen Path that makes you avoid Ungoliant's Spawn in favor of getting ten progress tokens.

Overall it was a really fun experience and I can't wait to keep going down the quest line to see how far I can take these three. Gloin's not my favorite without some ability to heal him, and Theodred was really just a good Steward (appropriately!) to Aragorn who was the real star. 

How'd it go for everyone else?

I tried the tactics deck with Gimli, Legolas and Thalin. This deck is powerfuk against enemies but cannot succeed solo. There is not enough questing power to make progress and thus each turn you are only delaying the inevitable except for the few times you draw an enemy. Locations just overwhelm this deck. It will combine well with leadership i think.

 I, too, chose the tactics deck, got an early run of locations, ran up my threatometer. In the turn before my threat was to run out, and I was to be cut down by a previous rounds big bad orc guy (don't know name, but he gets +2 attack each turn) I scored gandalf, played him, reduced my threat and was about to cut down aforementioned orcy guy with my dwarf dood that gets +attack for each damage he has. however shadow effect did one damage to him, which enabled bad orc guy to cut him down before he could return the favor. The game ended with me 2 tokens away from completing the quest, and all my doods getting cut down by enemies.

The lack of healing is of one concern, as is the lack of questing progress. Combining the deck with one that can assist me on either one of those fronts would be of interest.

 Retracted: I made a ruling mistake: Engaged enemies do not contribute their threat! I won the thing! WOOOO!!!!! (with aforementioned tactics deck)

I've played three solo games so far as lost them all. With just three characters I find it exceptionally difficult. I'm tempted to use four heroes instead of three.

## 6 [apelite on April 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=456387)

We won our game with a score of 120, (a rules interpretation notwithstanding) in a 2 player tactics and leadership game. We struggled for ages to make any in roads in the first quest card in Mirkwood, and lost Thalin and Aragorn pretty quickly. Then it quietened down a bit and we loaded Gimli up with mad powerups giving him +10 damage. But it was stilll very close and we would have only lasted a couple more rounds at most. And Ungoliant's Spawn turned up at exactly the right moment.

## 7 [Oshio on April 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=456454)

First game went well, was extremely tense!

I ran the Knowledge deck against the first quest. Got off to a bit of a slow start. The deck's healing powers are awesome, but it suffers from a real lack of combat strength aside from Glorfindel, who also happens to be the best quester. I was lucky to get Hemarth Riversong in my opening hand, who's ability let me look at the top card of the encounter deck every turn - so I wasn't ever surprised. I also got a couple of Daughters of Nimrodel out early and their healing mojo kept my characters feeling good. I had the misfortune to draw Ungoliant's Spawn early and had to lock him down with the expensive-but-amazingly-effective "Forest Snare".

But it wasn't all fun and games, an early "Caught in a Web" locked down Denethor for the majority of the game, until I finally pulled a Miner of the Iron Hills to free him. The game came down to the wire, my threat was in the mid-high 40's and I had already locked down the Spawn when I got to the end of the quest, so I had to pull 2 more Spiders on top of an Orc that was already giving me trouble. So not only did I have to take down the really, really tough Spawn, but I had to hold off 3 other baddies to boot. Long story short a lot of guys got sacrificed while my Heroes fought off the Spawn. The last round was nail biting...my three Daughters of Nimrodel all defended the 3 opponents while my three heroes and my Erebor Hammersmith attacked the Spawn. One daughter sucked it up and died. The second...ran into a horrendous Shadow card that dealt 1 damage to all of my characters, instantly killing her AND the other defender. So that left 2 attacks undefended, which took down 2 of my heroes in one fell blow. I was left with Glorfindel and the Hammersmith, who did exactly enough damage together to take out Ungoliant's Spawn.

Close! Really close! But they did the job. I had a bit of luck (getting the early Daughters was key) and a bit of bad luck (Caught in a Web is just brutal and effectively takes one of your heroes out of the game, and I had Gandalf up and ready to fight Ungoliants spawn but discarded him out of my huge hand when I traveled Necromancers Pass the turn before) so I think overall it was fairly even.

Skimming through the rest of the decks has me interested to try them out. The Tactics deck looks great, but it also looks like it would be almost impossible to play solo. The Spirit deck looks fairly boring and has some pretty weak heroes aside from Eowyn. And, finally, the Leadership deck looks absolutely head and shoulders stronger than the others, especially with the broken Celebrian's Stone and Steward of Gondor support cards. Celebrian's Stone alone, while unique, almost makes one want to buy three sets to run 3x just so you can drop it on Aragorn asap.

Anyways, those are my thoughts!

I practiced with 2 normal teams of Heroes, like a 2 player game, but on my own.  It does seem easier.  Each of the Spheres are good in 1 or 2 areas, but have weaknessess in others that the 'GAME' can exploit.  Getting another Sphere to cover your deficiencies, looks the way to go.  Solo Sphere play can be won, has been won and will be won, but it is tough.  Well done to all who have succeeded!  Remember that the  Milkwood Quest is only difficulty 1.  The next is 4, and the third is 7!  Hopefully we will all know the game better by then.  Cheers!

Got it today and so far have gone through 2 of the single sphere decks against the first quest.

I agree with others that tactics is a difficult deck to win solo with, it took me three attempts, and the third attempt i think i was pretty lucky to avoid too many locations, as these can just clog up the staging area and with the low willpower ratings of the tactics deck (and difficult to obtain any bonuses) its very difficult to progress the quest.

If you can get past card 1B though, "2B and 3B can fall pretty quickly.

Have also played with Leadership deck, and using Theodred's power with Aragorn's to effectively allow Aragorn to quest and fight in the same round is a pretty powerful combo. Made the passage through mirkwood a breeze, relatively speaking!

 

 

## 10 [prune on April 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=456511)

My first couple of solo attempts were failed, partially because I was misreading the rules (e.g. counting the threat of current location against me in the quest stage).   One of those early attempts, I was at the location that doesn't allow you to draw cards, and didn't have enough willpower to overcome the threat total that I was doing incorrectly, which was clearly game over.

Once I got it straight, I actually did pretty well using the Leadership deck.  The Theoden / Aragorn combo (Theoden supplies Aragorn with a resource when they both exhaust for the quest, and then Aragorn spends the resource to untap) was a key.  Also, once Faramir hit the table, I could hold him in reserve and decide whether to spend his special (exhaust to give +1 will to the characters committed to the quest) depending on the encounter card that turned up.  That plus lots of little allies helped me churn through locations, one per turn.

It was still tense and on-edge most of the time, an early treachery card dumped 4 event cards out of my hand, and it was touch-and-go for a couple of turns because of that.

At the end, a Sneak Attack from Gandalf, and being able to have everyone gang up on the Spawn, and I was able to get the win.

I think part of it was that I got lucky and pulled lots of locations; the combination of many small allies, and Faramir, and untapping Aragorn, really deals with that well.  More combat would have made it been harder, because I'd be steadily losing allies.

Card sleeves are a necessity, and I'm still trying to figure out how to keep everything organized in the box.

## 11 [jhaelen on April 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=456852)

I've played three solo games (the Mirkwood scenario) so far, using the Leadership, Lore, and Spirit sphere decks.

I won the first game (Leadership) easily mostly because of a lucky first hand: With Celebrian's stone I was breezing through the adventure. I scored 40 points.

The second game (Lore) was slightly more difficult but was turned around eventually by adding Faramir to the party. I scored 37 points.

The third game (Spirit) started extremely well since I could keep my threat level very low. In the end I lost because I had drawn the alternate third adventure card where you have to defeat the Spider boss. Since it kills a character every turn, I was soon running out of combatants.

To be honest I felt that the first scenario is a bit wonky, at least if played solo with mono-sphere decks. The outcome pretty much depends on which version of adventure card 3 you're drawing. If it's 'Beorn's Path' (which I had drawn in my first two games) and you have a sphere that is good at adventuring, you'll win. I assume if you're using the Tactics deck, you'll win if you draw the other path.

After the very first round of dumb mistakes, I immediately picked up my 'winning strategy' for future games: Don't go adventuring in the first round so you have the best chance to immediately get rid of the Forest Spider. Once you reach the third adventure card, go adventuring with as many characters as you can, ideally winning it in a single round.

 I just played a Aragorn/Theodred/Eowyn Ld/Sp deck and sailed through Mirkwood with a score of 35. And so, full of confidence I decided to continue on down the Anduin in 'Nightmare' mode. Two trolls turned up straight away and so that lasted less than 2 turns.

So far, every time I've drawn Beorn's path, Ungoliants spawn has appeared in the next turn or two anyway - particularly annoying with the tactics deck, as i was able to kill it easily enough (Gimli + Citadel plate + Dwarven axe + about 5 points of damage is a fairly fierce attacker) but it took too many turns, and the threat got out of control before i could score any quest points. With a bit more luck/experience, it could probably have been turned around, but as that's only a difficulty 1 quest, it doesn't bode well for the later stages...

Our best score thus far was 44 Total....Spirit + Lore Decks.  1 Gandalf in each deck...though we saw him no less than 4 times.

## 15 [CrowOfPyke on April 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=457113)

A buddy of mine came over and we played the Passage Through Mirkwood scenario - the first one you are supposed to play.

 

We got our asses handed to us.

 

We played with two decks mashed together so we played with 50 card decks each instead of 25.  He had Tactics and Spirit and I had Leadership and Lore.  He used Legolas, Gimli and Dunhere.  I used Aragorn, Theodred and Glorfindel.

 

Problem number one was that all of my friend's heroes were of the low Willpower variety, which made Questing difficult.  Problem number two was that we got hit with Ungoliant's Spawn and King Spider on turn one, and Caught In A Web and Driven By Shadow on turn two.

 

Yeah.  Ow ow ow ow.  Basically we got hammered before we even had a chance to build up or do anything at all.

 

After that experience I would say this:  Tactics and Lore seem to go well together, as do Leadership and Spirit... so we were behind the curve from the start there.  Next, we didn't tune the decks at all and remove any high cost items from the deck in the Sphere where we only had one hero.  If you want to tune the decks at all, then having 2 or 3 copies of the base core set is important.  Lastly, Legolas is THE MAN, especially with Blade Of Gondolin attached.

 Our first game we used the Tactics and Spirit decks.  The combat ability in the Tactics deck kept us alive through the first adventure, while the Spirit moved us as swiftly as possible through the quest cards.  We ended up successful with a final score of 81.

Wow, the tactics deck really cannot be played solo.  The combined will of the 3 heroes is only 4 and there is only 1 card in the entire deck that can bumb that up to 5 with Beorn. (of course I forgot to put in Gandalf too but he's only good for one turn, how's he gonna help me quest?)  You should at least have a will of 5 or 6 when questing and that means I was never able to quest at all let alone be able to defend myself after exhausting all my characters for the aforementioned pointless questing.   There definitley seems to be an imbalance among the decks currently.  I played previously with the spirit deck and had no problems earning explored tokens on active locations and the quest. 

 

So are you guys that play solo using two decks as if two people were playing?

I've been playing one single-sphere deck so far, always with 3 heros.  Leadership seems pretty solid on its own, Lore was too slow all by itself.

I think I'm probably done with the single sphere decks, and will instead work on decks with two spheres (tactics and lore in one, and leadership and spirit in the other).  Playing 2 decks solitaire doesn't feel quite right to me, I think I'll save that for sitting down with another player.

I think you are forgetting Legolas awesomeness.

 

And Gandalf card (2 copies at least) is pretty much a MUST in any deck at the moment. He can help you do many things.

I just picked up the game today. For my first game I played the Leadership deck vs. Passage Through Mirkwood, and I breezed through fairly easily with a score of 39.

It seemed a bit easy, but getting Steward of Gondor on turn 1 meant that I didn't have any trouble getting a ton of allies into play. I pulled "Don't Leave the Path" for my final quest card, pulled Ungoliant's Spawn out as my spider of choice, and defeated it right away.

I'm looking forward to trying the other decks, and some 2 player games once my wife gets home from work!

 I played two games.  Both two player. The first was the Mirkwood.  It wasn't too bad. I played Spirit and my buddy played Tactics. Legolas  + Blade of Gondolin FTW. Tactics can be played solo.  Unless I'm missing something glaring, the only downside to not questing is that it just gets harder to quest.  No threat increase unless the threat strength is higher than the committed willpower. I think.

So Legolas quests through murdering piles of monsters.  I'm thinking of making a Loregolas deck.  3x Rain of Arrows. 3x Blade of Gondolin. 3X Quick Strike.

 

The Anduin. Hoo boy.  I played Leadership and my buddy played Lore. Yikes. Gloin kicked the bucket at the end. (Leaving the birds undefended and assigning him the damage generally stays lucrative as long as Lore is able to heal him).  Without Faramir and an army of goons, the day would have been lost.

No, not questing is bad, very bad. As then the threat will always be higher and raise your threat a lot. Even if the threat is only one or two its still higher than zero.

Keep in mind that, if you use Rain of Arrows, it doesn't trigger Legolas' special ability.

No. It just makes it easier for another character (if equipped with a Blade of Gondolin) to also trigger the advancement.

Hello,

I am just after my first game using mono Leadership deck with all 3 heroes trying to push through Mirkwood's spiders.  Well, what can i say - the son of Arathorn failed miserably and to make matters worse he did not even have a dignity to die on the battlefield like a man but fled before constant increase of threat leaving poor Gimli choking with blood behind...

 

The game is plain brutal when you draw unlucky streak of encounters...I must say i enjoyed the scenario even though the game kicked my ass in i believe 6th/7th rounds.  However my team's humiliation was caused not by their incapabilities but really unlucky streak of encounters pouring threat on the party.

I must say i really sympatised with them - after a nice hand draw which came with 2x Gandalf + set of allies they thought Mirkwood will be a peanut. Having a high spirit they commited to the quest willingly hoping to quickly progress through first part of the forest just to be hit on the head with Necromancer's Pass drawn from encounter deck just after that. Then they took the old forest road with Forest spider chasing their tails. Gimli took the fight with spider and his wounds contributed resources so needed to call Gandalf to aid them in next round

Things were not looking that bad at tt moment as Gandalf promised to help clear old forest road and even progress some more through Mirkwood and just at the moment he commited to the quest along with the rest of the team Mountains of Mirkwood emerged on the distance driving back the party with their tails down. Gandalf left the party so they were left questing in vain just to not let the threat build up without the chance to go deeper into Mirkwood or even go past old forest road . Battered by spider Gimli was crushed to see Hummerhorns to emerge to staging area - they called Gandalf once more to help but even when he disposed of the creature and assisted in questing he was left speechless and his heart fell when Necromancer's Pass threatened them once more...The threat was relentlessly beating them down and when during next two consecutive rounds they were hit each time by Necromancer's Reach causing Gimli to fell not to rise ever again they saw their end is close.

 

Well - that would be about it :-) When the game is hard on you i saw no chances with monodeck, especially if the party questing potential is not high enough to overcome possibility of appearing two threat-heavy locations in staging area not to mention active location and some creatures in addition.:-)

Anyway it is all a lot of fun s i cannot wait until i tackle Mirkwood again!

All in all - a GREAT GAME :-)

I'm not sure what you mean by this. If you don't quest the threat strength is always going to be higher than the committed willpower. The threat shoots up if you don't quest.

I so far have only had a chance for one run at it last night after work. I used the Lore Deck. I got pretty bogged down mainly due to wondering how exactly to interprest rules. The one that flumoxed me most was how to use the Shadow Cards abilities during engagements. I was forced to discard an attachment card, but could not figure out if it only applied to the Hero in the engagement or the entire questing party.

LOL.  Well that takes the game from challenging to brutal for the second two scenarios.  Lore is not good.

Got my first game in finally.  The first scenario was pretty much a breeze, even with decks we made from just one box.  The Troll was really the only challenge (although the dogs that go back into the staging area are VERY annoying in the last one, since you have to kill all minions).

I had Aragorn, Gloin, and Eowyn  - my friend had Legolas, Gimli, and the draw 2 gal.  I quested heavily, he kicked butt with Gimli mainly.  Turns out Aragorn with Steward of Gondor 1st turn is as good as I thought it would be.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Even making a ton of mistakes we finished with a good score. 

Some cards were worse than I thought they would be (card draw isn't that good IMHO, even using all the cheap events), and some were way better (the tactics guy that does 1 when he defends, the kneeling a hero to stand one).  It was a fun experience, but I am looking forward to solo, and playing the other (harder) scenarios. 

## 31 [SirRoke on April 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=457593)

 We won our first 2 player game (barely) using the Leadership and Spirit decks. The Northern Tracker & Lorien Guide made an immense contribution! Much easier to handle locations when those scouts & rangers add progress tokens. Gandalf made an appearance at just the right time which really helped. We lost about half our heroes by the end but managed to win. It felt a bit odd at the ending though since we won by defeating Ungoliant's Spawn but had so many other enemies attacking us that we wouldn't have lasted two more rounds. Story-wise we had to interpret it as the monster's death causing the other enemies to run away in hopeless fear.

It really is a story game for a cooperative group which is what we love best. The various Quests will make or break this game in the long run. We're looking forward to the next Adventure pack already so expand the possible scenarios. Using specific Encounter sets really enhances the story feel and makes each quest really different and new cards and sets will enhance the story and challenges and make it more replayable.

While we are looking forward to seeing new characters, my fear is that adding lots of new attachments and events, especially if they require modifications to the existing rules, will interfere with the wonderful flow and ease of play. That's what, IMHO, killed the Decipher CCG. Later expansions overwhelmed the rules with all sorts of oddities that made it harder to play and less fun.

Keep the Quests and Encounters coming! That's the heart of the game and story. More characters (can't wait to see Bilbo in the next pack) would be great too. But please take it easy on Events and Attachments so it doesn't become an arms race or spin off in odd directions.

 I played with the standard Aragorn, Gloin, Theodred in a solo game.

First, I absolutely crushed the Mirkwood quest. With everyone unscathed I felt emboldened and moved right on to the Anduin. Wow, that was freaking hard. I got past the Hill Troll okay, but I got hung up about halfway down the Anduin (16 quest points!?) 

I kept getting the **** surge bats, so for 2 straight turns I had THREE encounters! 

In the end, it was my threat level that took me out. I got 2 copies of Pursued by shadow, of course, OF COURSE, on turns that I hung back from questing to deal with my one optional engagement. So, that was +10 threat right there... toast.

All in all, an amazing and quite addictive game. I now feel like a hermit as I'm huddled over playing cards alone.. but I'm ok with that.

 Made it through Anduin the second time just barely, with a score of 52.

I finally drew a Gandalf which was a huge help.. and I got to use him for 2 turns thanks to the card that lets you drop an ally then return to hand.

Came down to Aragorn and allies taking down Chieftain Uthnak.. epic!

 My first games with each sphere ended with a 2-2 record. 

Spirit has great questing power, but doesn't appear to have enough hitting power to survive many enemy attacks. 

Tactics has massive killing ability, no need to worry about any enemy. However, low questing seems to earn a great amount of threat.

Lore is a versatile and very tricky deck. In one play I don't think I quite have a full grasp of it. Fun stuff, though. 

Leadership is very versatile and good at almost everything. I'm particularly fond of the great number of allies. I'll say the same thing that I said when I first read The Two Towers, all those years ago: I like him. A lot.

I'll be the first to say outright that my first experience sucked. My head was buried in the rulebook most of the time trying to figure out what happened first, then next, and what does this do, and what happens now, etc. I had a friend come over who has some Magic experience and together we tried to make sense of it all. I have ZERO experience with this type of game so the learning curve is huge for me. So far, I am frustrated, so I'll have to watch the tutorials again, read the rules again, and read more forum comments. My friend and I decided to start with the Leadership/Spirit deck but two hours later we hadn't made it to 2A of the Mirkwood Scenario due to the rules marsh.

Maybe I'm missing a key element here, but with only 3 heroes, playing solo is really hard. You exhaust one to questing to stay in the game threat wise, leaving you 2 to defend. Except for Spirit most of the starting values are over 25, so you're at LEAST pulling the Forest Spider. I tried first with Lore (starting value of 30) and pulled everything on the checks. 2 defenders isn't enough when you have 3-4 enemies engaged. Therefore, you're either taking massive damage or you have absolutely no one to attack with, which just increases the number of enemies. With Lore I could keep healed fairly long but my threat quickly got to 50 (in like 5-6 turns). I tried my second game with Spirit (starting 24) so I got one free round without pulling the Forest Spider but quickly ran into the same issue of not enough hit points to soak the free attackers. I lost one hero on turn 3 due to a bad shadow card. 

Am I missing something important for solo play? If not, my enthusiasm for this game dropped quite a bit.

Yeah, if you have 3-4 enemies engaged then you are going to have a problem but you should kill them before it comes to that point. Plus in the first scenario you shouldn't have that much trouble with the first turn. 

Say you are playing the lore deck. You get an average starting hand and play something like the Daughter of the Nimrodel. There is 3 Threat Strength showing (in the form of a Forest Spider and an Old Forest Road) so you decide to send Glorfindel and your Daughter of the Nimrondel questing. Say you flip a second Forest Spider. You increase your threat by 1 but that was a risk you took. You decide to travel to the Old Forest Road so you can straighten Glorfindel and use him to attack. Then the two forest spiders engage you. You decide to defend against one of them with Denethor and he takes no damage. Since you know you can use your Daughter of Nimrodel to heal you later you decide not to defend against the other attack. You put the three damage on Glorfindel. Then you use Beravor and Glorfindel to attack and kill one of the Forest Spiders (Their combined attack total of 5 is enough to kill it). Then you increase your threat by one because it is at the end of the turn.

So at the end of the first turn you have 3 damage on Glorfindal which you can heal most of next turn and a single Forest Spider in front of you. There is nothing in the staging so you can send only Beravor questing so that you can attack the Forest Spider with Glorfindel. Maybe you even have an extra ally or two to make the turn easier.

Thank you.

I've since played a couple of other types of deck and won. One was Leadership/Lore using the super-engine of Aragorn/Theodred/Steward/Stone and another was Tactics/Spirit with Legolas/Thalin/Eowyn. In the Leadership/Lore game I had like 15 allies out by the end, so now I realize just how important they are. I'm also getting better at recognizing the cards worth mulliganing for. So, having actually won 2 times so far, my outlook is much better for scenario one at least.

Well, my first game went the same way as my 2nd to 9th games - I got the heads of my Heroes served to me on platters... Until I discovered that engaged enemies do not count as being in the Staging Area and therefore do not add their threat values to the Quest. Correcting for this oversight brought victory in the very next game (Leadership against the 1st scenario).

Whilst I appreciate that no set of rules can account for all possible card interactions - the game has been made playable only with the help of these forums. I think the rules, as far as they go, are well presented, with plenty of worked examples (and video tutorials available) - however, I am eagerly awaiting the first official FAQ.

Love the theme - love the presentation - and I think it's only going to get better.

Leadership + Lore starters, victory with a score of 72 (37+36+3-4). Getting Protector of Lorien on Glorfindel and Aragorn meant questing wasn't all the difficult. Once Faramir showed up, questing like crazy (commit everyone on Leadership side, then use the Ready all characters, use Faramir netted 9 tokens on the final location where you need 10 to win). Would've won in one turn, but saved Sneak Attack + Gandalf (with Fara extra 5WP) in case something nasty would pop out of the Encounter draws.

 I've played 8 times so far, each time with a solo deck and always against Passage Through Mirkwood. First game was with a Leadership Sphere and I lost, second game was again with Leadership and this time I managed to win with 43 points at the end. Third game was with Tactics Sphere and I lost, so fourth game was with Tactics Sphere again, this time I won with 49 points at end of game. Fifth game I chose Spirit Sphere and again lost! (pattern emerging here!) Sixth game was again with Spirit and I won with 40 points at end. Seventh game I chose Lore and (you guessed it) lost, so eighth game was with Lore again and I managed to win with 45 points at end.

I enjoyed all games, but have since realised I had been playing slightly wrong ( to my detriment) I included the threat of Enemies that were engaged with me and so would often find it difficult to progress in quests. If I had played correctly I believe I would have won more convincingly and may not have lost so many of the games. On the plus side I have managed to succeed with all Spheres.

One thing that I found throughout all of the games I played is that Quest card 1B is the hard part and once/if I got passed that it was fairly plain sailing to win from there. Depending on the Sphere you play, a card draw of mostly Enemies or mostly Locations is a major factor in your chance of winning.

Oh and another thing, on every single game that I got to stage 3B on, I always drew Don't Leave the Path, so I have always needed to kill Ungoliant's Spawn and have never tried Beorn's Path. I may not do it random next time and choose Beorn's Path to try it.

Won 4 games  of Mirkwood in coop Tactic/Leadership without problems. But we cannot win Anduin :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Rules Question: If no player will commit any character to quest - so no character questing. Will encouter deck slit stag new cards? Is possible to avoid questing and then stagging another enemies? Sometimes we had 3 locations in stagging area and another asi active location and we cant have enought willpower for questing...

Thx for answer!

Reveal Encounter card(s) and Resolve Questing are both mandatory steps you resolve, regardless of whether you send people to quest. If you don't send anyone, all the Threat out there goes straight to your dial.

Recieved my 3 core sets today (only opened 1 yet) and just finished my first solo game with starter deck of leadership (scenario 1). At start I was worried about not having enough willpower to complete quest AND being able to attack and defend as well. In the end I won pretty easily, though primarily because I got Steward of Gondor out in turn 1 and got out 1 ally each turn with these extra resources. Ungolianths Spawn came out quickly and because of its forced effect I lost the quest phase and threat went up to 32, just enough for the spider to engage me. Surprised me a bit, but the next turn I could kill the spider with help of Gandalf. Then I got lucky with card draw from the encouter deck I guess and questing from then on was easy. Then I had to kill the Spider again to win...

Well I had fun, though I felt a bit lucky. The combo of Theodred and Aragorn Questing seems really strong and with Steward of Gondor you get a (relative) huge boost of resources each turn. Well I think I will try another game tonight with Tactics. Doubt I will get through so easy again.

Luck plays a part in those games too, unless you have a perfect game where all players involved always make the optimal move. But since it's normally only known what the optimal move was after the game has finished, these games tend to include luck as well. Not as much as in a random draw game like LotR, obviously, but still.

Well I wasnt so lucky with the tactis in scenario 1 solo, as expected. Questing was awful and altough I could take on every enemy, my threat kept rising sky high. Lots of locations on the table and I could not even explore the first location. Well lost big time, though with some tweaking, I can see nice potential for tactis.

Today I played my first 2 player game with a friend. He Leadership, me with spirit. Well we started with scenario 1, got easily through it, thought we could continue our quest and go straight through scenario 2 and had so much fun and went so well that we managed to beat scenario 3 as well, though it was really close in the end (my threat at 48, friends at 46). Did not keep track of scores, but I guess we did well, no heroes had died (though gloin almost was gone). So we finished our first nightmare mode game and had lots of fun. Too bad next time I know what the quests will be, as now it was a surprise what my goals would be. Well next time lore and tactis I guess, lets see how far we can get with that.

Having a tough time making any quest progress.  I ran Tactics against the first quest a few times and quickly got crippled, so then I tried Leadership/Spirit against quest two and got creamed by the troll.  It's getting kind of annoying, really.  I think next time I'll try Tactics/Lore against the first quest, but I'm thinking that I'm probably gonna do custom rules to make it easier on me.

If you are getting frustrated I would try a Leadership/spirit.  It is the best combo I think for these opening quests.  Then you can get some victories and not be so discouraged.  I must say I am having a great time with the game with my three oldest kids.  I am hoping to get the wife to play tonight.  I think it will be a better pass time for her than facebook games.

To answer the thread topic, however, the first game went fine. Me and a buddy played Tactics and Leadership, respectively. We got lucky with some Gandalf/Beorn draws to kill Ungoliant's Spawn. Overall it was a whole lot of fun. We had a few things we needed to get clarified, and thankfully the unofficial FAQ thread is alive and kicking, so thanks to all who have contributed to that!

I then played a few solo games. Annihilated it with the Spirit deck (Final score of 22!), and then got crushed with Lore. I knew I shouldn't have let that Dol Guldur Orc attack go through unblocked...

I've played a few other games: a 3 player Spirit/Lore/Tactics game, and Spirit/Tactics game, and we've managed to win all of those on the Escape through Mirkwood scenario.

Overall, Spirit is my favorite faction right now, though I see huge potential in a Leadership/Tactics deck (Sneak Attack-> Beorn, etc.). Now I have 2 more core sets on the way so me and the missus can start fiending. Can't wait to see what we come up with!

First game was a success. I played a Leadership deck using the cards from two core sets. Also included three Gandalf cards (which ended up being one of the key cards I used for victory). Final score was 40.

Aragorn and Steward of Gondor combo was set up on first turn. This was huge. Along with some chump allies, Faramir came by about mid-game and helped seal the deal. He's an amazing character as well, especially if one has a bunch of chump allies able to commit to completing a quest.

In the end, Faramir died to US, but in turn his sacrifice was not in vain for Gandalf and Aragorn were able to kill off the foul beast for the win.

I plan to try the other spheres as well, but I really liked how Leadership played for me.

## 66 [ClydeCloggie on May 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=464555)

Have now played the first two games of my "Full Matrix" project: 4 starter decks * 4 scenarios = 16 games.

I kicked off with the Lore deck.

First game against PtM-DLtP: a hopeless loss, got US shadow effect early on raising threat to a level where I couldn't afford an easy turn and all enemies auto-engaged. Got swamped by Spiders and when Chieftan Ufthak entered the fray, the game was up.All heroes killed in the turn I started Quest 3. With Threat at 47, I had no hope at all of killing US in 3 turns while at the same time questing to prevent threat being added and keeping my heroes alive.

Second game against PtM-BP was on a knife edge. I eventually lost due to Threat hitting 50 with 9 progress tokens placed on Quest 3! The killer was a last-turn Necromancer's Reach which took out Glorfindel and removed his 3 Willpower from the Quest. If I hadn't spent my 2 available pool (Denethor had already fallen to the Hummerhorns) on an Erebor Hammersmith for his 1 WP, but 1 of them on healing Glorfindel, he would have lived and I would have scored the winning progress token. Bad decision making, essentially.

Did a lot better today with Leadership/Spirit for a nice questing engine, but I still feel the encounter deck piles up too fast for a solo player to handle.  I'm experimenting with custom solo rules, like questing requires only half of the listed progress token rounded up, and a five-card limit on the encounter deck until new spaces are cleared.  Also contemplating a Magic: The Gathering system where blocked monsters and heroes/allies simply exchange combat damage, since you have to exhaust them no matter what.

## 68 [Sign Ahead on May 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45478-howd-your-first-game-go/?do=findComment&comment=464770)

I've had a lot of first games, so far all in Mirkwood:

My first solo game with the Leadership starter deck went very well. Using Aragorn twice per turn is very, very helpful. The second game was a success too, even though I had to kill Ungoliant's Spawn twice. Overall, the Leadership deck is effective, flexible and very forgiving of new player mistakes. After playing half a dozen more games, I think this deck may actually be a little too strong.

That made my first games with the other starter decks kind of disappointing. When the encounter draws went well (when they alternate weak foes with bonus-granting locations) the Spirit, Lore and Tactics starter decks are fun and challenging. But they fall apart quickly when the encounters don't go their way.

Now I'm trying my first few games with mixed, 50-card decks. It probably has a lot to do with my inexperience, but these decks are really susceptible to bad encounter draws. On my best game (with a mixed Leadership and Lore deck designed to generate resource points and cards as fast as possible), I fought the encounter deck to a standstill. All those cards and resources gave me a lot of options, but deciding how to use those options was very slow. After 90 minutes I called it a night. On my worst game, I lost two of my heroes on my second turn to a horrible combination of the Necromancer's Reach and the Hummerhorn's shadow effect. Since then I've played 7 or 8 more games, and they've all been pretty quick and pretty brutal. I'm hoping I'll get better with time, but right now the frustration's getting the better of me and my decision-making's getting worse with every game.

Haven't had my first 2-player game yet. But that'll happen next week. I suspect that this is where the game really shines anyway.

:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Seems i've done something wrong. perhaps that's why my first couple of goes at PtM were so easy. I have played passage through mirkwood for about 5 times now and i've never lost, usually finishing a solo game with around 45 points and a dual game with 60/65. I think the mistake i'm making is this. Instead of mono faction (tactics, lore, etc.) i'm playing dual sphere decks. Both in solo and dual games. For a game I just mesh up all the spirit and leadership cards + 3 gandalf for a 61 cards deck and take 2 heroes, say Aragorn and Eowyn.

Isn't this a valid way to play the game? The games have been rather easy until now, beacuse most of the time i played with one 'combat' sphere (tactics, leaderschip) and one 'control' sphere (lore, spirit.) So questing for 8 has been rather common after turn 7 or something (eowyn + attachments, faramir, etc.)

Thanks,jorm

jormungadr that is a perfectly fine way to play. You can play with whatever deck you want. Mono, dual, triple sphere. it is up to you. You are not doing anything wrong.

Well I have finished a few games now and we are actually finishing in the negatives! last night we scored -24 on JatA and we scored -21 just a few mins ago! have come to look up tricky changes and peoples new scenerios! :-)

Did try a few homebrew changes but even 2 tournie decks can't beat 1 treachy and 2 other cards every turn! :-(

Well, I just got my core set yesterday and after reading through the rules my wife and I decided to give it a twirl - just to keep it crazy and adventurous we opted no to look at any of the cards in the decks before playing.  I picked the core set's default Spirit deck and my wife took the core set's default Lore deck.

Not quite having a full grasp of the mechanics and all the bizarre combinations of effects that could happen in this particular game, my three heroes were dead by the end of turn 6.  My wife got cooked shortly threafter, as there were too many critters in the staging area being dumped on her to handle solo.

So I decided to try Passage Through Mirkwood scenario again solo.  I used the Spirit deck again and did manage to win (barely) with a final score of 54. It came down to a race against the clock (or rather the Threat Dials) as the one hero I had left was badly wounded, had that accursed "Caught in a Web" treachery card on him (and I was out of resource points) and all my allies that were out were on the weak side (2 Northern Trackers and 2 Lorien Guides).  The Chieftan Ufthak card was waiting in the staging area to come out and beat the tar out of me.  The big advantage I had there was using those 4 allies to knock out Location cards from both the staging and active areas very quickly.  Thankfully, I did manage to get the 10th required progress token onto the "Beorn's Path" quest on the turn when the threat dial changed to 35, preventing me from ever having to fight Ufthak.

Whew!  If that one was level 1, I can only being to guess how much more difficult the level 4 and 7 scenarios will be...

 Hi folks! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Finally got the game...I spent days and night translating it in italian for our distributor and it was a nightmare. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Great game, lots of concepts and terms...

I loved it since the first time I read it...But now I finally got my copies and played a bunch of solo games...

Tried 3-4 games with Leadership (mono), a couple with Tactics and a couple with Spirit...Just the first scenario (I focused more on the gameplay than the actual deckbuilding-strategy)...Won a couple of games with Leaderschip and almost won one with Spirit...Tactics didn't work that well...

It seems like a bunch of bad "encounter draws" can ruin the whole game: too many locations or the wrong enemy at the wrong time and you're done...But still a great game experience...

I generally like the "american style" in card-boardgames...Luck is part of our life, so why avoiding it in a game? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 


This game is a matter of tough choices and encounters, extremely strategical deckbuilding and some luck...Very nice, especially if you consider that it's a boardgame with a card-game core, that's almost perfect for any kind of player out there.

Solo play is addictive for me and I'm lookin' forward playin' some 2-3 players game...

 

Someone says that 4 players games are "easy" and not that satisfying...Is it true? 

I guess things will get better with adventure packs...But, as I see the game right now, I see it like a 2, maximum 3 players game...maybe 3 players is the right choice for a possible but still tough game experience.

 

Anyway: definitely like it both like a piece of "art" in game design and an amazing, original card-board game.

I recently played my first 2-player game, introducing my friend to it. Fortunately, he seemed to love it! I kind of threw him in the deep end, having built dual-sphere decks, but he got the hang of it pretty quick. We then decided to make mono-sphere decks to best use the resources and played a couple of games with those. Overall, we won scenario 1 3/3, scenario 2 2/3 and 0/1 on scenario 3.

He said he's looking forward to playing again, so now I'm looking forward to HFG for some new cards to explore. I would love to try 3 or 4 player, but I don't know any other card players :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

You are lucky just for having one friend who likes to play Lotr with you.I have no one and i only play solo.I enjoy it a lot but but i think this game must be a lot better if you play it coop.Sentinel and range keywords are only letters in my games sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

Very true servant. I think if you are stuck playing solo, you might want to try to pilot 2 decks at once to simulate a 2-player game. It makes the scenarios easier as well as opening up more options. I just know from my solo play, it gets somewhat frustrating to pilot one deck against certain scenarios.
