How does the victory display interact with locations and the quest cards in Wrath and Ruin? If I have a location (let's say Seedy Tavern) which when explored should go to the victory display does it do so or do we take control of it instead?

Right now I can see this going both ways but it can be quite important for fulfilling the quest conditions.

I was not sure about this myself. The quest card effect is essentially a replacement effect (even if not worded as one). The Victory keyword itself represents a replacement effect:



> When an enemy or location with the victory keyword is defeated or explored, it is placed in the victory display instead of the encounter discard pile.

I am more leaning towards the side of "this is a specific effect of the quest and supersedes the general effect of the victory display". Anyone else has any insight?
