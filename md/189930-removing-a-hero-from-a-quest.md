If a card requires you to remove a hero or an ally from a quest, does the card remain exhausted (if it was exhausted to commit to the quest) or does it return to ready to become uncommitted to the quest?

It remains exhausted.Â  Being committed to the quest and being ready/exhausted are independent of each other.
