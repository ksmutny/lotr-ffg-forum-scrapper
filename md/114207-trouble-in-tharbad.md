I have played this quest 3 times so far (all victories) when i saw the cards for the first time i thought that it will be a running quest (high will power, questing, questing and questing some more) fortunately it wasn't. So my impressions. First of all it has a very unique and fresh feel to it. The 4 difficulty of FFG is very close to reality it is definitely not hard and it is a little above easy. Lastly this is a quest that will make many people revisit (or try for the first time) secrecy.

I like to read your thoughts and you opinion about it. I personally liked it, i find it to be a really fresh, unique and loose experience.

Sounds easy but very fun! Would you imagine higher starting threat decks (let's say oh 27 and 29 for example =p) will have a lot more difficulty with it or not really? Having to quest harder/longer to get to zero threat on stage 1 and all.

Just realised for this particular quest on stage 1 at least Tactics has some sweet ass threat reduction for the first time with Legolas! =D after he kills an enemy, reduce each players threat by 2! (As long as there is no active location =\)Woooooo!

Yes this quest opens new ways to play and approach the game. Low threat heavy questing decks can smash through the first stage, but you have to pase your play to make sure you can escape stage 2 in one to two rounds, or things can be very ugly.

Won my first playthrough using an updated silvan deck with Glorfindel (spirit), Celeborn, and Haldir. Even though the scenario wasnt terribly difficult, i think it was more because my deck performed phenomenally. For example, opening hand i played O'Lorien (which worked to perfection, resources were never an issue despite the tri sphere deck and i didnt even run steward!-prob first leadership deck that hasnt had it) I then was able to play a galadhrim minstrel for 1 resource, grab a feigned voice, and play a silvan refugee. Turn 2 i used my 3 resources for a defender of the naith. after staging i had 2 enemies in play, i engaged them both. used feigned voices to stop the first from attacking, returned the minstrell. Defended the second enemy with the naith defender he took one damage. used people of the forest to bring back the refugee and threw out the silvan tracker which readied up the defender. the tracker, naith defender, glorfindel, Haldir, and Nalir were all able to kill the two enemies and it was smooth sailing from there.

Naith Defender worked a lot better for me than i thought he would i encourage people to give him a chance. with silvan trackers out to heal him and any kind of defense boost (mine came from arwen) he is a very reliable defender.

It took me a while to clear stage 1 but thankfully when i got to stage 2 i had enough of an army to clear the crossing at tharbad in 2 attempts, i can see stage 2 getting pretty hectic and difficult though if things get out of control. Fun quest and one i dont really think requires a specific kind of deck to beat

Your post all made sense when i realized you were talking about The new Galadhrim minstrel, i forgot she was in the pack and you wrote Rivendell minstrel. I was totally confused, you played her for 1 resource first round, fetched feigned voices, returned Minstrel to hand? Huh! I had to go back and look at all the cards i thought i missed something.

So I just realized that Herald of Anórien is sorta an Outlands card designed for mono-Leadership Outlands decks because he can help bring the non-Leadership Outlands cards into play when you don't have enough resources on Hirluin to pay for them but you have resources on other Leadership heroes.

 

I don't know if this is on purpose, but it's kinda irking me. I'm just glad that his applications are spread far broader than Outlands.

Has Magali done anything for this game recently?  I know she's done some work for MTG.  I hope her price point has risen so far that we don't see more of her work in the future.

I'm personally sick of Magali being on everything, especially every elf. Now, before you go nuts, I do like her style and detail, and I think she's extremely talented, but I prefer to see her when her style fits the card. She could've made a great Haldir I'm sure, but she's already done pretty much ALL the elves. I really welcome seeing elves not done by Magali. Blood of Numenor is a great example of a card that works great with her art. She should make more like that.

Regarding Galadriel, it would be interesting to see when the art was commissioned.  Personally I love her work and just have to look at the Elrond ally to be reminded of it.  I don't care if she does every elf in the game frankly.

Thanks for correcting my error, will edit the previous post.

Played another match with a friend. Went a lot less smoothly since we couldn't progress until BOTH of us had our threats at zero at stage 1 and took much longer. With the time counter hate in the encounter deck our threat roof was lowered to 30 but thankfully stage 2 wasn't terribly hard to get past. Def seems like the kind of quest that increases in difficulty the more players you have but overall still not overly difficult

Why would i go nuts lol? You completely misunderstood my comment by the way, I said i would like "Magali-esque" artwork, not that i wanted the artwork to be done by her. See the difference?

I just would have preferred something more beautiful and elf-like to what we got. 

But i still think it's good, just not as good as it could have been.

Ah alright, it seems I misunderstood you. But then again why would you want Magali-esque art? You mean like Alexandre Dainche, which is pretty much the same? I mean if you're having Magali-style artwork, you better get Magali artwork.

 

I appreciate the different art style for an elf.

I personally find Haldir's art excellent, and not only because of a change in pace. Magali is great but in this case, Haldir is perfect (that beautifully green scenery :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]).

Yeah exactly like Alexandre Dainche, i just used "Magali-esque" for the lack of a better word. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

What i really wanted was something that feels poetic, beautiful & divine you know, really captures the ambiance of the elves.

Marvelous.

One of two things I was missing in LOTR was the use of "Ranged" characters in solo play which obviously is supported in this expansion pack.

Second thing is "Sentinel" keyword which I hope also will be supported in solo play.

There is monsters like bats from distant mirkwood cycle who can be attacked or defended only by characters with ranged or something.

From the release article:

"Herald of Anórien (Trouble in Tharbad, 57) arrives. Better yet, if you feel you’re truly doomed, you can give the Herald “doomed 2” when you play him and bring into play another ally of printed cost two or less. In this way, the Herald even allows you – or a teammate – to recruit allies that don’t match your spheres of influence, expanding your deck-building options by allowing a mono-Leadership deck to recruit powerful allies like Gléowine (Core Set, 62) or Arwen Undómiel (The Watcher in the Water, 58), whose game texts can change how your deck functions."

I consider Arwen one of the best usefulness-to-price ratio allies of the game.

## 37 [FetaCheese on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1220169)

Just finished the quest with a Caldara deck. Glorfindel and Frodo assisted my new favorite heroine in beating the quest in 7 rounds. Despite my low starting threat, the encounter deck throws some pretty threat-heavy enemies and locations. My threat limit was lowered to 40, but it was never an issue in the game. In fact, the average questing deck will probably not have any problems with quest phase 1.

 

In phase 2, I had 4 total enemies in play and 2 locations total, despite taking on 1 enemy every round. Here threat management becomes an issue, as even 1 or 2 points can result in double engagements. Thanks to Emery and Arwen, I only lost one ally and then finished the phase in 2 turns after bringing in a Shipwright and a Northen Tracker back from the discard pile thanks to Caldara, then getting her back thanks to fortune or fate. Quite some time was spent in this phase going over engagement options and I could see it turning ugly quickly under other conditions. I never fought the nastiest enemies, Mellanarch's followers or whatever.

 

All in all I enjoyed *** thanks to its innovative approach to threat mechanics and the many options surrounding engagement checks and travelling options. Because a standard deck can beat it easily, I feel that its difficulty level is quite appropriate. It felt like a breath of fresh air. I plan on playing it again between harder and longer quests. 

 

Kudos to FFG for introducing unconventional victory conditions in the latest packs.

 

By the way Caldara is awesome and I highly recommend playing her!

Played this twice, lost the first time using the ally free deck I was using on 3 trials, not enough questing power. So I added in some allies, but it was still not super heavy on questing. I won the 2nd game, but it took 16 rounds. I was down to the 10 threat out limit. It took forever to make it through the first stage, but the second stage was cleared in 2 turns, so i found it a bit anti-climatic after the long struggle, at which point i thought i might lose many times.

Did I like the quest? Somewhat. I'll have to try it some more, with some different decks. The time mechanic was a bit of a nuisance to keep track of especially since there are tons of effects to remove counters, and even i was very close to losing many times, i never felt very frightening like it does in other quest, because the real reason for losing was more associated with the threating out mechanic rather than with being beaten into the ground by the encounter deck, so that felt really different, and in some ways it was a bit boring. Basically it felt harder than it is, but it's really not that hard.

I'll give it some more tries with some different decks to get a better sense of it.

Try a Khaza Dum era deck Tracker. An old fashioned questing deck using modern cards largely trivialises the quest. Feels something like a Shadows of Mirkwood adventure with a shiny new coat of paint. Still, this is a difficulty 4 IIRC so it is to be expected I guess. Perhaps in multiplayer it would be more of challenge, I don't know. Still, after the beating endured by Dunlendings, I don't mind something lighter.

I try another deck with Haldir, and I can pretty much complete he whole quest without an enemy engaging. Having the main mechanic be about lowering your threat through questing at stage 1 along while just about every difficult enemy in the encounter deck being above 30 engagement, makes the scenario quite simple for a deck that focuses on attacking the staging area. By the time stage 2 is reached it only takes a round or 2 to win.

Overall, the scenario design is an interesting Idea, but the path to victory is so straight forward and predictable that I don't see getting much replay value out of it. That being said, i certainly do not mind this scenario every once in awhile.

I have not tried to use secrecy cards and deck on this yet. It probably could work well since the scenario makes it so easy to achieve secrecy. Although, i'm shying away from it because it's kind of a false secrecy set up by the scenario, if i took the same deck and played it against another scenario with high expectations since it did well on the current scenario, i'd probably be in for a rude awakening. Personally I'd like secrecy to be a viable option on many scenarios, and not have to be given customized quests that allow me to play that type of deck.

My super-hero attachment deck lost its first game and then I switched to elves and destroyed the quest.  Finished 2B in one turn.

 

I didn't do it, but I think A Watchful Peace and/or Shadow of the Past to recur Hidden Alleyway could be quite powerful.

## 42 [GrandSpleen on August 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1223242)

Won on our first attempt playing blind today.  2-player game with Haldir/Merry/Pippin(Lo) ranger deck on one side and Dunhere/Denethor/Glorfindel(Sp) questing deck (with Dunhere on the staging area) on the other.  

 

It took us awhile to build up enough questing power to start really getting our threat down, but the encounter deck did not build up momentum thanks to Haldir and Dunhere removing all threats and Glorfindel taking down locations here and there.  I think we got past stage 1 after about 6 rounds, but the time counter never went off thanks to some helpful locations adding counters and preventing them from being removed.

 

We finished the second stage in two rounds.  The last card revealed was Get that Dwarf!  Bellach was in the staging area, and this would simply have ended the game in failure, even though we very much owned the board for the rest of the game.  Luckily, we had A Test of Will and we won.. but this is one of those awful scenario-ending cards like Sleeping Sentry that you just have to prepare for.  Other than cancellation, I suppose all you can do is engage all high-attack enemies ASAP (imperfect solution) or boost Nalir's HP or defense some way (Arwen, Ring Mail, Hardy Leadership).  It's a pretty easy scenario with a curve ball; I'm not a fan of that card.

 

Overall, we had a nice easy run, only engaged 1 enemy in the entire game.  Denethor was not needed for defense, so he got to have a good time looking at the encounter deck.

 

We enjoyed it, but it probably won't be a frequently played quest for us.

Really doesn't seem that bad at all so long as you have a ready character/defender.

You're right, thanks for that.  I was interpreting this as "Nalir has to defend."  Guess it's not so bad!

Hmm, so the attack is directed at Nalir but if you have other defenders you can actually defend with those? Wow, that sounds very interesting and creative. Props to Caleb and Matt for coming up with an actually interesting escort mission. So at first we had Arwen who contributed but was in no real danger (and if she was, you were dead already), and now I had thought that they had gone to the other extreme, that Nalir was absolutely vulnerable to attacks made directly to him. But know that I know that you can defend him with other characters, the quest becomes so much more interesting!

Yea this quest isn't too tough solo. But I could see it being quite tough with 3+4, since Nalir would be raising a players threat by 4 each turn

Here's my Silvan deck which was able to score consistent solo victories.  Naith Guide and Feigned Voices are so fun and O Lórien! finally pulls everything together.  The big surprise for me, however, was how useful The White Council was.  Originally included just for event recursion on some of the key Silvan stuff, it turned out to be remarkably handy to ready a hero in a pinch with an action from my hand.

 

10534718_899090566785842_861316483342212 [https://fbcdn-sphotos-f-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-xfp1/v/t1.0-9/10534718_899090566785842_8613164833422122969_n.jpg?oh=0bea613d95989d2816c447bb1846baec&amp;oe=547C2170&amp;__gda__=1417116921_61428f309063a8eb476da1e13476a055]

 

Of course, there is still little else that brings as much joy as using Hands Upon the Bow to one-shot a boss villain in the staging area.  With Rivendell Blade and Black Arrow on Legolas, you can use the event to drop Bellach before he ever does anything and then, with Foe-Hammer, draw 3 cards for the pleasure!  (Not to mention 3 progress on The Crossings of Tharbad for Legolas and his Blade of Gondolin.)  Quite epic!

 

It was also nice to be able to use our new hero (Haldír) and new archetype (Silvan) with the quest that came in the box with the cards.  Recent tradition has been to include Objective-Allies (like Faramir and Gríma) or specific-build quests that can't be beaten with the new player cards forcing you to pull out an old scenario to try your new toys.  I like this better.

 

Finally, it's nice not to get kicked repeatedly in the teeth by a new quest every once in a while.  This was light and fun.  Thanks FFG!

When I played Silvans vs. The Fords of Isen, the Defenders of the Naith were amazing given how often I was engaged with multiple enemies. At one point I managed to have a couple of them in play, defend with them and then chump a third attacker so that they readied and helped defeat the enemy.

No, Defender of the Naith was underwhelming in solo play for Trouble in Tharbad.

 

I can imagine him being more useful in multi-player though, blocking an Orc Hound, then readying after another chump block or other Silvan shenanigans, to take on an Orc Hunter or (if you get lucky with the shadow) an Orc Skirmisher with his sentinel trait.

Just finally got my hands on trouble in tharbad!

Beat it second attempt. (two handed)

First attempt I was smashing it so far and had played a dunedain mark on haldir first turn and for the other deck a ranger spikes and light of valinor on glorfindel. Had a location and treachery (that I removed a time counter to counter the other effect) come out during staging. Engaged one of the spys from mordor and feinted it stopping its nasty time counter removal and then killed it with Legolas, Nalir and Elrohir clearing The Empty Mug thanks to Legolas. Haldir attacked the other spy using his ability and did 2 damage to it (and would have probably killed it the next turn) and I was ready for turn two. Finished planning and then had a marauder come out which had ranger spikes attached to it as it entered staging and then? GET THAT DWARF! Because the lore/spirit deck was the first player this resulted in the marauder attacking Nalir and Elrohir not being able to help out... it was either Nalir or Haldir for defense (quested with Elrond and Glorfindel).... either would have died easily and resulted in either loss or more or less a loss (I don't really play on when heroes die unless I'm pretty far into the quest already). Just got super unlucky I guess and hadn't established Sentinel yet on Elrohir with an Elven Mail or Arwens buff resulting in an easy defeat due to Nalir getting destroyed by that nasty Marauder!

 

Second attempt I smashed it although was stuck on stage 1 for a fair while and had my threat limit reduced to 30 and was somewhat worried it would reduce to 20 as I started to get minorly location swarmed (even with asfaloth out) and was barely reducing threat anymore. Stayed between 9-15 threat on both decks for a few turns and managed to eventually quest hard over a round or two and finally get to zero (only 2 counters left on the quest stage at this point narrowly avoiding a 20 threat limit) and got to stage 2. Smashed stage 2 over three turns and only had the time effect trigger once (thanks to an Orc Scout, or whatever the one that reduces a time counter or reveals another card is called, removing a time counter) and was easily able to kill all enemies except for Bellach (only because on no turns could I kill him outright, one turn I could put him down to a single hitpoint, so instead I killed all other enemies and ignored him) who I feinted twice and more or less ignored.

Was pretty fun but going to give it another go and try to get through stage 1 a little faster.

One thing I noticed from this set is that The Tree People is fairly ridiculous. In a aborted game yesterday I played Henamarth Riversong for one, then played The Tree People and the only Silvan ally in the five cards was Rumil. Getting a four-cost Ally for one resource is insane.

I look video where people play Tharbad quest and one of them play Silvan deck. i must admit Silvan deck is pretty strong and is also fun to play.

Quest is interesting some inovation is there but is looks pretty easy. I look forward for last pack actually

## 60 [MyNeighbourTrololo on November 1, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1318918)

Ok, until now I only played this quest solo, but today some friends dropped by and we had a 4 player game of Trouble in Tharbad. 

 

Before I'll get into detail, I'll list some things that can be considered a handicap: We had a pretty threaty party, each player starting the game around 30 threat: Haldir+Beravor+Loragorn=31, Gandalf+Spirfindel+Idraen=30, Imrahil+Celeborn+Elrohir=32, Eomer+Brand+Elladan=30. Also, as you can see, Gandalf is used as a hero, and not even as a part of overly strong "Gandalf Eagle Deck", so leadershit player couldn't sneak attack him and stuff.

 

 

Ok, down to the business. With 4 players, this quest is really brutal, or so it seemed to us. At the beginning of the game, you have 4 enemies each of which will remove 1 time token on attack... "whats the problem?!", you'll say, "just don't engage them, their threat cost is 40 for crying out loud!", you'll continue. I'll tell you what's the problem: questing. If you'll be lucky and no engage cost lowering effect pops during first quest round, you'll face a dilemma: engage those spies this turn and suffer the loss of -10 threat out threshold OR keep that 8 threat in the staging area and suffer the same loss later. Fortunately, we revealed only 1 enemy during the first quest and he fell right into my trap, so he was no problem... for now. Other 3 cards were 2 locations and a treachery which forced us to remove 1 time token (because the other effect was A LOT of threat). I was forced to use the lore event to nullify the threat of one of the locations, so we could explore Empty Mug turn 1. Then, we travelled the Streets, engaging every spy with each of us right after. And like that, first round our threat threshold dropped to 40. We managed to kill 3 out of 4 spies the same combat phase, thanks to our strong and potent heroes. And that was just the first turn. Each turn the encounter deck did it best at hasteful time counter removing, we were walking at the brink of existance, barely lowering out threat in time before threat out threshold falls once more. In the end we won, bot GOD it was a tense and close game. To anyone considering this quest as an easy pie - I encourage you to try it with as many players you can muster. Not to tell how thematic it is - trying to hide from everlasting pursuit, entering hideout to catch a breath, brigands retreating to the roofs and patiently waiting to counter attack, Bellach getting lost in the encounter deck but slowly cathing up on us... there is so much theme in this quest. 

 

Funny fact: I used Loragorn's ability to drop myself from 36 to 31 on the turn one to prevent myself from threating out at 40 on the next turn (threshold was already lowered once)... Now that I think of it, I probably had to discard Aragorn because of Empty Mug's victory display effect?.. LOL!

 

Also, remember that Orc who got into my trap? We thought we were rid of him... then Get That Dwarf! Showed up, and it so happened that for that time this Orc had the highest Attack value :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Also, Haldir was a total beast. These times when I was left alone, he easily made a -1 enemy before it even could attack. Leadershit player imbued him with this +1 Attack Dunedain thingy, while Tactics player gracefully granted Haldir both Dagger of Westernesse and Rivendell Blade.

Just to make sure I get this right

 

Nalir causes you to raise your threat by 1 for each player, and then you have to raise it for the refresh phase also, right?

 

So when playing solo you raise your threat by 2 on each turn

## 62 [PsychoRocka on December 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1373694)

## 63 [Nickpes on December 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1373750)

And another question (stupid really, but my mind is blocked)

 

"The first player either removes 1 time counter or each enemy get -20 engagement and +1 att "

 

There are no enemies in game, thus I am obliged to remove teh time counter, right ?  :unsure: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_unsure.png]

 

And a rule question, but it has to do with Bellach

 

I have a ranger spikes in staging area, unnatached. I complete stage one and Bellach enters the staging area cause of stage 2 ... does he get trapped in Ranger Spikes?

Hmmmm that is a tricky one.

It reads "The first player EITHER removes 1 time counter or each spy enemy gets -20 engagement and +1 attack" so with that wording it seems like you can choose EITHER effect whether or not any spy enemies are in play.

Also you technically can resolve the second option as you can give each spy enemy in staging -20 engagement and +1 attack there just aren't any actual spy enemies in play to give these effects to.

This thread comes to a similar conclusion and Caleb ruled that with Followed by Night even if no enemies are in play you can choose the second option:

http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/126831-quick-question-followed-by-night/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/126831-quick-question-followed-by-night/]

It does use the word ALL enemies instead of EACH however...

 

Also look at this thread: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/114412-must-either-back/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/114412-must-either-back/]

If it was MUST either x or y then you would have to do x and only do y if you cannot do x. Considering you can always remove a time counter in this quest this wouldn't really even make sense so I'm pretty **** sure thanks to these two threads from the past that you can choose either option even if there are no spy enemies in play =)

Do you have a clue about my other question for ranger spikes (I did not attach it to Bellach and the other orc again, cause I prefere to cheat my self , in case ...)

## 66 [PsychoRocka on December 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114207-trouble-in-tharbad/?do=findComment&comment=1373802)

As with Bellach yes any time ANY enemy enters the staging area for any reason (effects or during staging) if there is a copy of ranger spikes in the staging area at that point in time that is unattached it will attach to that enemy. This is why ranger spikes can be so extremely pimp against We Must Away because "Players cannot play attachment cards on Troll enemies" and ranger spikes attaches itself from staging not from being played onto them. It is very hard to time and if a single other enemy comes out the round you progress to stage 2 it will take the ranger spikes first and stop it from attaching to one of the trolls but I've pulled it off a few times, once I was actually able to get ranger spikes on two of the three trolls and was able to pick them off and deal with sacks at the speed I wanted to.

Ranger spikes can also attach to Overseer Maurul from Nightmare Seventh Level and many other mini bosses/nasty foes. Another situation that comes to mind is Lord Alcarnon and Murzag, you can get ranger spikes on Murzag from the effect of Morgul Vale returning him to the staging area and if you have a ranger spikes in staging when you kill Murzag and add Lord Alcarnon to staging you can ranger spikes him too.

I cannot overstate just how pimp ranger spikes can be, you can get them on the PERFECT enemy at the perfect time on occasion.

Yeah anytime I'm not sure I usually choose the harder option too so that if I am doing it wrong I am at least not benefiting from it lol. I just learned these two particular rulings from reading the forums and remembering rulings when other people ask about stuff.

There's a pretty interesting discussion in the comments section for ranger spikes on cardgamedb.

It seems as though only if enemies are added to the staging area at the same time (such as in the troll quests) can you choose which enemy each ranger spikes attaches to if you have multiple copies out. If it is just during the staging phase both ranger spikes will attach to the same first enemy revealed and not others revealed after it. I have only ever played more than one at a time in the troll quests and it seems like the only real reason to play more than once at a time is if you know that multiple enemies are going to enter the staging area at the same time like in the cases of the troll quests.
