Hi,

Is anyone else noticing something wrong with the Quest Log? Specifically when using the 'Compare Quests' function? A friend and I who always play together (and thus have the exact same stats) noticed that things are not matching up correctly for us anymore. On his computer it keeps saying I have 18 extra solo wins. And on my computer it keeps saying HE has 18 extra solo wins.

Also, no matter who I 'Compare Quests' with, it doesn't show the Sphere Weights anymore nor the 'versus' percentages for these. It just says '0%' for all sphere weights for both players.

Under the normal 'Summary' page everything seems fine. There is no extra solo games and the Sphere Weights are working. It's mainly just the 'Compare Quests' function that something seems wrong.

Anyone else having this issue? I really like the Quest Log and think it's a great tool so hopefully this is just a minor issue that FFG can fix.
