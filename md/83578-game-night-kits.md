Seeing this news:

http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4126 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4126]

I really want to get my hands on these 2 kits. I don't have any store where I live that can get me these, so I have no idea how to do it.

Why aren't these on Print on Demand? Does anyone know how to get them?

Thanks!

Javier

I have the first set of nightmare cards. We won first and second but Dol-Guldor nightmare is really difficult to win. But we still try to do it.

I really look forward for second one!

I want these sets! Please FFG, put them on Print on Demand for us who can't get them any other way…

I do believe ffg has said they will eventually put the nightmare scenarios as print on demand.  They gave an estimated time frame after their initial game night kit release' but I can't remember the details at the moment.
