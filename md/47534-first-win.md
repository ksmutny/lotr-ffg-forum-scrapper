Yeah. After 9 attempts of the Passage through Mirkwood scenario i have finally beaten it.

 

I used Leadership/Spirit deck with Aragorn, Dunhere and Eowyn.  Final threat level was 40 and had 5 damage on my heores so the final score was 45.

 

Is that a good score?

Congrats.  you got a win!  Don't worry too much about score.  The scoring system is a mess and it makes it near worthless as a mechanism to compare the relative success level of different decks.

Great job on the win - I know it took a couple of tries for me as well. I am still sitting at a 60/40 win to loss ratio, and I have only played the first two scenarios.

As for the scoring, look at it more as a personal benchmark. I have seen some negative scores here in the forums, but the best score I have on Mirkwood is 21 points. Just keep trying to get lower than your previous mark.

 great job! congratz! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] keep it up and never give up! I lose regularly on the 2nd scenario, except with pure spirit or spirit lore combo... the thrid is still unbeatable for me in solo mode.... which proves, that it is impossible to play this game with less than three heroes... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
