Thror's Key reads:

 

Response: After a location is added to the staging area, attach Thror's Key to that location. While attached to a location, Thror's Key gains: "Treat attached location's printed text box as blank, except for traits." 

 

How about effects like this one, on Lone-Lands:

 

Forced: After placing 1 or more progress tokens on Lone-Lands, each player removes 1 resource token from one of his hero's resource pools, if able.
Response: After Lone-Lands leaves play as an explored location, Bilbo Baggins gains 1 resource. 

 

 

The Forced text is clearly inactive while Thror's Key is attached.  The Response, however, is triggered after Lone-Lands leaves play -- if it has left play, that means the Key is no longer attached, right?

Uf! Dificult question. I guess, yes Bilbo can get 1 resource, but if i thought "Bilbo must quit out 1 resource", then i would guess that Thror Key not triggers response, lol. So i don't know.

 

One question more: if you attach Thror Key to a location with "when revealed", does it trigger his "when revealed" or not?

You can find the same question about Warg's Lair here : http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92338-unofficial-faq-compilation-of-answer-from-around-the-web/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92338-unofficial-faq-compilation-of-answer-from-around-the-web/]

The response would not proc. Thror's Key is a passive and would prevent the text to apply while the locaction leaves play even if it is also discarded as a result.

No-- When Revealed effects resolve before the card is added to the staging area.  Thror's Key can be triggered only after the card has been added to the staging area.
