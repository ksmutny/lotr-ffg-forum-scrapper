Continuing the "not too powerful but overal balanced" tendency on the cicle, I like Lembas (finally!) and "O Lórien!" a lot.

 

The new Hero Haldir, I don't know, with Rivendel Bow he can help to clean other players, and as I understand what the card says, he can also attack the staging area, right? It's a nice ability, although I expected a bit more. Maybe a Lore hero to accompany Celeborn and help to pay for other silvan cards, so you can combine several spheres behind Celeborn's banner.

I still need to make up my mind about haldir.

Seems he has a build in Hands on the bow ability, for in the combat phase.

Which is a great card to use outside the combat phase...

O lorien is great for a silvan deck of course, most of the other cards are just....ok.

This packs player cards score a 'meh' on my spoil-o-meter.

The more I think about a Celeborn - Haldir - Legolas arrangement, the more interest awakens me...

 

Yeah maybe he has a "nice shot"   :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  in a deck like this.

I'm thinking Haldir - Merry- Pippin (Lore).  Between noiseless movement, feint, hands upon the bow, and take no notice, you might not ever need to defend.  And Haldir will be able to quest, too, once we get Wingfoot.

 

Part of me wishes he had more Silvan synergy, but I'm also glad that he isn't pigeon-holed into that deck type.

Leaving aside his ability, 3 attack for 9 threat in Lore is pretty awesome.

What a great pack!  Not only can we finally build working Silvan decks, but there are lots of great cards in there.  I really like what they're doing with the cards in this cycle, and the more packs that get released, the more I like it.

Free to Choose is going to be a rockstar card.  Great for secrecy decks because it gives you some insurance against doomed and threat raising encounter cards, and as a response, it can protect against threat raises during setup.  It will also be a must-have for Into Ithilien (I see you Watcher in the Woods) and other scenarios that raise your threat like crazy.  And in multiplayer, it will help the Spirit player keep their threat low so that you can use your Galadrihm's Greeting on the other players.

Especially if you have more than one in your hand. Turns nasty threat raises into big reductions. Add in Elfhelm just to rub it in even further (Disturbed Waters [http://www.hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Disturbed-Waters-TWitW] anyone?). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

And good point about the setup threat gains. Nice to see something other than Eleanor that can do that.

Dunhere + Haldir seems like a natural combo, pair with Bard/Yew Bow on the other side of the table and feed Haldir Rivendell Blades, spears for Dunhere.  Would make a nice 3-way team to assault the staging area, but I wouldn't want to put all three of those guys into a single deck due to threat.

I agree, we needed some more powerful cards, still the power level of these cards is pretty good overall.

 

I really liked the player cards, but I still don't know what to think about Herald of Anorien. On one hand he basically puts more leadership weenies into play, but on the other hand I don't like the fact that he is a weenie himself. I would've liked better a Gondor leadership ally with 2 or more strength, to have a good attacker in the Leadership Gondor deck with Boromir, IMO that's something that deck lacks, but I still think he works well. Also Defender of the Naith is going to die the first attack and can't even quest. What's its purpose?

 

The rest of the cards though are amazing, especially O Lorien! and Lembas. The two spirit events are pretty good as well as the other allies. This quest seems extremely brutal IMO.

 

And also the return of my talented fellow Chilean Carolina Eade! O Lorien looks like another version of her Galadreil art from back in the day.

I like the Herald of Anorien. He lets you put a free ally into play like Bill the Pony or the Rivendell Scout but is good for decks that care about Gondor, don't have Sam, won't be in Secrecy, etc. Since he doesn't care about what sphere the ally is, he'll act as resource smoothing some of the time. The downside of course (besides the doomed) is you have to actually have another ally in hand to get his benefit. I will definitely be trying him out.

 

Looking ahead, the Herald is another way of dropping in one of the "little" Ents (who enter play exhausted) while providing a meaty body for the current round. Sure he won't be doing much attacking, but just having the extra willpower/chump block can make a difference.

 

Edit: I also look forward to having another cheap boost for Willpower in the card Courage Awakened. One of my favorite 'mini-games' is to see how low I can score on Passage Through Mirkwood, and clearing out Stage 1 in the first Round requires 11-13 WP off of ~2 Spirit resources.

I get that he was not meant for combat except as a chump, but I just wish they had done an attacking ally instead. And now that I think of it, there are many "utility" allies of cost 2 or less: Master of the Forge, Imladris Stargazer, to name a few off the top of my head. So yeah, opinion totally changed about him, he's pretty decent.

 

Since he can play allies off sphere I imagine a 4 sphere deck of just all-around good 2-cost allies, using of course leadership to use the Herald, also spirit to recycle the herald many times and swarm with 2 cost allies, of which the deck is moslty composed, having of course more leadership and spirit allies. It could work.

There's quite a few 1 and 2 cost allies with 'enters play' effects he could combo with as well. Things like Envoy of Pelargir, Naith Guide, even a Miner of the Iron Hills.

 

Most importantly though, you can get a free use of Keen-eyed Took.

The new Gondor ally is a pretty nice addition and one I could see using Doom 2 to take advantage of. It is helpful when trying to quickly build up an army. Also, love Gwaihir. Wish he was a hero or at least a cost of 4. :/ I love running eagle decks but they are really pricey...even with mono-tactics.

At that point wouldn't it be easier to throw Steward of Gondor on Elrond (or at least have both)? That doomed will be pretty hard to swallow if you want to use him over and over again to fix your resource matches.

 

I picture him going in decks that are looking to set-up aggressively and try to win in just a few rounds instead of turtle, since the doomed is going to be bringing more enemies in and you'll also be dumping your hand pretty quick with this guy.

Well my first thought was that this will go in a tri-sphere Gondor deck I made recently, with Imarhil, Tactics Boromir and Glorfindel.

Consistent attacking in the staging area! Haldir fits all the niches I could have ever wanted.Silvan AND Ranger! Boosts Rumil... Perfect for a secrecy deck... Still valuable even if guys are coming out to attack a partner thanks to his ability to attack before the enemies attack!... Might be my new favorite hero.

Right now I've been using Legolas, Mirlonde and Celeborn. I'd switch Mirlonde for Haldir but I'd want a reliable way for him to quest and attack, I feel like otherwise I'm better off with the Haldir ally. What do you guys think?

Wingfoot + Rumor from the Earth. You don't even need many copies of Rumor, a single one granted you have card draw should do the trick. Of course you pay the resource to keep the card. I've used this proxing Wingfoot and it works great.

A few thoughts about the Haldir wording, which I initially thought was a bit odd (why didn't they just say something similar to Dunhere's ability?)

 

It's worded in a similar manner to Quick Strike, which means:

 * You can attack an enemy engaged with another player using his ability, then declare a ranged attack against that enemy, and finally participate in a ranged attack against the same enemy (I think? - I'm a solo player so ranged rules are a bit fuzzy for me). Rivendell Blade in this case would become very powerful.
 * Enemies who are immune to player card effects can still be attacked, as opposed to cards like Hands Upon the Bow, or indeed Dunhere.

In next pack I believe we get lore attachment Wingfoot, allows a ranger hero to quest and ready if you selected the right card to be revealed from the encounter deck, so basically if you always say enemy the hero will always ready after questing. Perfect fit for Haldir.

I have not quite digested the cards yet, there is a lot to chew on here, O Lorien is really important card for silvan decks, all those 3 cost silvan allies are will now be 2, that's pretty big. It will allow the ability to make a tri sphere silvan deck deck even more doable. Before I was using Grima for the doomed 1 discount, but this card is so much more thematically appropriate.

Haldir with Rivendell Blades will be awesome. He is perfect for a secrecy deck add some rangers with bows and the deck can be designed to rarely engage enemies, also 3 attack for lore is big.

Nice to see a ranger hero below 10 threat.

What other heroes does this Haldir secrecy deck use? is it mono-lore to use Advance Warning, or does it use Spirit or Tactics? I think he's great for mono-lore Rangers but I don't see him in secrecy to be honest.

Haldir's combat action is once per round, so if he does not have enough attack strength to finish off an enemy in the staging area and more enemies are revealed in subsequent rounds, eventually the staging area will fill and engaging enemies will become necessary, at that point Haldir will also loose his ability since it relies on not engaging an enemy to work. He will need to be able to generate enough attack strength to finish off enemies first attack to make it a reliable strategy for a non engagement deck. I'm talking strictly solo here.

Dunhere on the other hand can use any readying effects and continue to hammer away at enemies in the stating area while wielding 2 spears for 7 attack. So, A deck built around Haldir and non engagement is going to have to rely a lot more on the non- engagement cards like Ranger Spikes, and some of the other events that keep enemies in the staging area longer. It will give Haldir a bit more time to chip away at them. Direct damage to enemies in the staging area is also going to help him out a lot too, Ranger Bow, expecting mischief etc.

If you have not given up on using Spirit Glorfindel, he is an obvious choice, paired with Merry your at 20 threat. So, there you have it. Elrond's Counsel and Galadhrim's Greeting and your good to go. Although if you read my post before this, I think this type of deck might struggle a bit more than the Dunhere model, although having access to lore opens up some different possibilities which might make up for it.

Haldir, Pippin, and Merry let you start near secrecy at 21, but without a good way to get down into it.  Still, this combination gives you easy access to Rivendell Blade, Westernesse Dagger, Hands Upon the Bow, direct damage as needed.  Or Great Yew Bow with readying effects (hello Lembas!) so Haldir could attack a couple of times.  Pippin will nicely increase the engagement cost of enemies, and with all Hobbit/Ranger heroes you could include Take No Notice as a 0-cost event.  Then traps: Ithilien Pit so Merry can contribute (along with Fast Hitch so he can quest), and of course Ranger Spikes.  Pippin's draw effect and Merry's ready would be wasted, though.

I think 2 Dagger of Weternesse over rivendell blade is the way to go for Haldir. As long as enemy engagement cost is higher than your threat you can turn Haldir into a Dunhere with 7 attack. Great yew Bow is a good thought, but it is restricted so at most he could have only one dagger or blade with the bow. It's hard to know if the extra attack to the staging area will be more important or the extra attack power, at this point I think I would go with the 2 daggers instead of the bow, but I'll probably try out both. I'll also probably stick with spirit Glorfindel for the threat reduction.

Haldir is awesome, one of the first heroes in a long time that I am actually considering swapping one of my current heroes out for. Thinking of swapping Loragorn for him in this deck:

I've actually listed a handful of pros and cons and am currently trying to decide if I should (even if just on a trial basis) swap Aragorn for Haldir. If you feel like it please give your opinion/any advice you may have on that thread =)

 

Lembas is awesome!!! heal and ready effect in one for just one resource! Elrond brings its healing up to 4 as well with his delicious secret herbs and spices. O Lorien will be fantastic in Silvan decks and makes older Silvan allies a bit more viable. Free to Choose seems pretty **** powerful as well. What's with Defender of the Naith though? Just seems like a rehash of Watcher of the Bruinen but still just as bad (maybe a tiny bit less useless). Also horrid art on Defender of the Naith, everything else looks either good or REALLY good though.

 

The quest itself looks really awesome, where are the quest cards??

> I think 2 Dagger of Weternesse over rivendell blade is the way to go for Haldir. As long as enemy engagement cost is higher than your threat you can turn Haldir into a Dunhere with 7 attack. Great yew Bow is a good thought, but it is restricted so at most he could have only one dagger or blade with the bow. It's hard to know if the extra attack to the staging area will be more important or the extra attack power, at this point I think I would go with the 2 daggers instead of the bow, but I'll probably try out both. I'll also probably stick with spirit Glorfindel for the threat reduction.

 

Why not one of each?

Also, not just the staging area but if you play multiplayer or two handed (like me) then he can also attack enemies engaged with your other deck/friend before they can attack with his ability. Inbuilt Feint (if you kill it) and Quick Strike (but only during combat phase) as his ability rather than hands on the bow.

Really cool design regardless of how good he actually is.

Good point, I saw that he had Ranged and wondered why you would need to use his ability to attack enemies engaged with other players, but he can totally pre-empt their attacks.  I already liked him, but after realizing that I like him twice as much since I play almost exclusively 2-player.

I play a lot of miltiplayer, so for me Haldir is gonna be auto-include.

 

I'm a bit underwhelmed by dat neutral silvan defender, He costs 3, yet most probably not going to survive more than 1 attack...

Yes, with Celeborn his defense is going to be 3 for the first turn. Speaking of the ways to boost him, I don't think he's worth of elven mail. And to defend multiple times you need an enemy with attack 3 or less who happens to be unlucky on shadow effects. Silvan Tracker + Elven Mail is far better. I wonder if anything else comes up during the cycle that makes that neutral defender better... Except for O, Lorien.

So because its "combat action" Haldir's ability is used after shadow cards are dealt but before the attacks take place correct?

> So because its "combat action" Haldir's ability is used after shadow cards are dealt but before the attacks take place correct?

It's used anytime an action windows during combat phase is. So, you could kill an enemy engaged with another player before the get the chance to attack.

 

The only thing is, Haldir needs to do it alone, no opportunity for anybody to join him in this attack.

How very exciting! Can't wait to give the player cards and scenario a go. With all the traits Haldir was given he can certainly fit in a lot of different kinds of decks (I was worried he would be pigeon-holed into the silvan archetype). His ability may not always be useful but there is certainly a gap that he fills for a lower threat lore hero especially with that 3 attack and ranged! While he is certainly a wonderful fit in a ranger deck (much better than Faramir is anyway) I think I'll be trying him first with Celeborn and spirit Glorfindel to make use of all the new silvan toys in this pack. The leadership attachment makes me much more comfortable not relying on Elrond to pay for the allies in a tri-sphere deck and the Lembas bread is also a nice alternative method of healing (compared to the unthematic steward of healing and the expensive and fragile daughter of the nimrodel). The neutral naith ally doesn't seem super useful but I'll give it a try too. The deck will pair well with a tactics focused deck especially for defense which seems to be silvan a biggest weakness and all the other great attachments like rivendell blade and elven mail. Legolas will be an obvious choice along and then I could either stay entirely elven with Elrohir and Elladan or go with Beregond for my primary defender then have a host of options for the 3rd: Bard or Brand (the latter may combo especially well with Haldir) for some further ranged support which will also help with Rumil and the new tactics event. Or maybe Beorn for the

big body and emergency sentinel. Keeping mono tactics would allow me to feasibly play eagles and run Gwaihir which would be fun or I could splash leadership and use Aragorn who could contribute in any phase (and even receive a rivendell now which id use), Balin for some low cost questingn and shadow support, or Sam for the low threat willpower. So many deck building options, love how the game has evolved.

I think any ranger characters can participate to Haldir combat action … or there is some rules I mess up?

The text implies that you immediately resolve an attack by this ability, like with the hands upon the bow or quick strike, without the chance of anybody else participating. Would be loadsa betta if am wrong though.

I guess they're putting a lot of support into the Scout keyword in this cycle then, since that's two heroes in two packs with the keyword. Good! Also nice to see a Haldir hero. In fact, I feel like all the cards in this pack are pretty good, with interesting possibilities to work out. And a 9 threat Lore hero is a big bonus, especially with stats that are well divided (good willpower, excellent attack). 

 

I think I'm most happy with the cost reduction attachment. It's good to see an option besides Steward that's cheap and actually gives great flexibility. Also, am I right in thinking it's not unique, so three can go down in one deck? I may have misread the card (looked at it on a tiny phone screen).

They've just released an attachment that can only be attached to scout heroes. It would be too silly of them to not release more than 1 scout heroes in this cycle, given there is no scout heroes before the cycle whatsoever.

Regardless of it's being unique or not, I'm going to put 3 into my deck. Too crucial to not have it in the opening deck. Will distill the excess with stuff like Erestor or Runes.

Are we sure haldir ability allows an attack to staging area?

I interpreted that it did, and it seemed clear to me, altough at BGG site there is some debate that it may just mean that Haldir can attack a enemy engaged with another player or a previosly engaged enemy with you.

Why it wouldn't ?

 

Does it say legal like in quick strike ? no.

 

Does it give you your standard attack that you can only do against engaged enemy ? no.

It says to attack an enemy "not engaged with you".  If you couldn't attack the staging area, they would have said attack an enemy "engaged with another player".

Seems pretty clear to me that only Haldir gets to attack, he only gets this if you have not yet engaged an enemy this round, and he attacks alone.

 

Since he is attacking 3, he'll need some boosts against most of the enemies we see nowadays.  I think the idea is to have Haldir and a few other ranged characters in play.  Drop Rumil during staging to soften up an enemy, and then finish him off if needed with Haldir.  This is going to require keeping your threat low though.

defender of the naith + elven mail, could be pretty good. Remember that Silvan Tracker heals a character when they ready, so you could use him to defend, then ready and heal him, then defend again at full health.

Another cool aspect that I just realized about the Herald is that he can allow other players to put another ally into play. I love it when cards can be used to greater effect in multiplayer. That can help mitigate the fact that doomed affects everyone.

Silvan Tracker effect only heals during the refresh phase. That's why Silvan Tracker itself more viable target for elven mail, rather than Defender of the Naith. Plus, Defender already has sentinel, so slapping mail on him is kinda waste from my point of view.

Haldir could be good with Grave Cairn. When a defender dies, or even, important, when you use an ability to return a silvan to your hand (there are a lot of ways when we talk about silvans). Celebron + Haldir + Grave Cairn can be inside a good silvan deck.

 

Herald of Anorien can be used by yourselve? If you play him, can you chose to yourselve and play another ally for free? In solo, he is good also then. It would be as: you don't pay for him, only you raise 2 to play him. The Herald is very good for trisphere decks, when you must wait 2 rounds to play an ally. Herald avoid the delaying.

 

O Lorien can be used for another players? Even if you have it attached, the other players can use its hability, isn't?

Yup. You're right. Forgot about that bit. I also agree about losing out in sentinel.

 

If it weren't for Celeborn's boost, he'd be like Orthanc Guard except more expensive and unable to quest. At least with the boost he's able to quest for one round, then he readies and is available to defend with 3 defense. After that though, he's even worse than Orthanc Guard because he can't quest, so he'd only ready after defending (assuming he doesn't die) and can contribute 1 attack. The only thing that makes him slightly better than Orthanc guard is that he has Sentinel.

 

I think we need to realize, though, that most enemies (not an overwhelming majority, but still a majority) still have 3 or less attack, meaning we can still get use out of this guy. Obviously, some shadows can end up killing him anyway, but in general, as an ally, it's not terrible for him to die. The issue is really that there are better defenders out there, especially for his cost.

 

Guthlaf can defend just as well, will have 1 permanent willpower, and will cost 1 less if you're using the right heroes. Defender of Rammas has 4 defense for 2 cost. As I mentioned, Orthanc Guard is comparable and costs less. Emery has better stats and can come into play for free. Watcher of the Bruinen is comparable and cheaper. Even White Tower Watchman is a better defender. Most of those don't have sentinel, but if you can only get 1 or 2 blocks out of the Defender of the Naith, then the 3 resources may not be worth it for defending other players. In general, though should be able to get their own chump blockers more easily.

Defender of Naith costs 3 because he's:

1) neutral;

2) silvan;

3) sentinel.

 

With O Lorien, he technically costs 2. With Grima 1, lol.

It would be hard, but possible to utilize him well, but I hope something that buffs him indirectly comes up until the end of the cycle.

So along with all the very nasty threat gained from various encounter card effects for this quest I've taken special notice of the treachery card "Get that Dwarf!". The treachery doesn't seem so bad at first glance but upon closer inspection it seems that the enemy affected makes an attack not just against the first player but actually against Nalir which means that it is his defense and hit points the attack will be affecting and if he dies you lose the quest.

Now he only has 2 defense and 3 hit points so if you have a healer out and he takes two damage and only has 1 hit point left you can easily heal him back to full with one heal. However for the attack itself he can take on an attack which has attack power of 4 maximum which blocks 2 and puts him to 1 health, five attack power or higher and hes one dead dwarf and the quest is failed. Lets have a look at the various enemies that are actually featured in this quest and what would happen if they are indeed the enemy with the highest attack in staging and what their attack against Nalir would mean:

Bellach (Trouble in Tharbad): This unique enemy has 5 attack so with or without a shadow effect his attack from Get that Dwarf! would instantly kill Nalir and end the quest.....

Spy From Mordor (Trouble in Tharbad): This enemy has 3 attack which means that Nalir will defend 2 of that and only take 1 damage. Should you get a shadow card that boosts attack it will do 2 damage intead, now as long as your threat is above 20 there are NO SHADOW CARDS in this quest that give more than +1 attack, there are some that let the enemy attack again etc but nothing that gives more than +1 attack so long as your threat is over 20. This means as long as your threat is over 20 Nalir can safety take an attack from a Spy from Mordor and survive on 1 health.

Bellach's Marauder (Trouble in Tharbad): This nasty enemy also has 5 attack like its master Bellach so would instantly kill Nalir from Get that Dwarf! whether it gets a shadow effect/boost or not.

Orc Skirmisher (Misty Mountain Orcs): The skirmisher has an attack of 4 which means Nalir's defense stops 2 and he takes 2 which leaves him on only 1 hitpoint. Therefore so long as the shadow card dealt has no effect he can JUST survive an attack from this enemy from Get that Dwarf. If the shadow card gives even +1 attack and you can't cancel it with a hasty stroke or something else then he is dead and you lose the quest.

Orc Hunter (Misty Mountain Orcs): This guy is more or less the same as the Spies from Mordor and has 3 attack so would only do 1 damage/2 if a shadow card that gives +1 attack is revealed.

Orc Hound (Misty Mountain Orcs): The Orc Hound is the only enemy in the deck that Nalir can defend against and potentially take no damage, his 2 defense stopping the 2 attack power. Should the hound get a shadow card giving it one attack Nalir will just take the one damage. The one other thing however is that when engaged this enemy forces the player to exhaust a character, if you randomly had everyone exhausted except nalir you would have to exhaust him and the attack would be undefended which would do 2 damage to him or if there was a shadow effect giving +1 attack as well it would kill Nalir. I don't really see this ever happening as I really don't see anyone not leaving a single character for defense/emergencies except for Nalir but just wanted to state it is a possibility.

 

One last thing to note is the other treachery card "Cornered". It gives you a choice between removing a time counter or giving all enemies in staging +1 attack and -20 engagement cost. Should this card come out during staging and you choose to give all enemies higher attack values and then Get that Dwarf is subsequently revealed as the 2nd (or if playing with more than two the third or fourth) encounter card during staging you are more or less screwed....

 

I think its safe to say even if just to protect against Get that Dwarf; enemies should definitely NOT be left in the staging area with this quest. So long as you are able take those fools on, don't leave them in staging, especially not if they have a high attack value, they could very well (due to a single treachery) end the game for you instantly! Bellach and his Marauding Orcs kill Nalir in one hit and the Orc Skirmisher has a pretty decent chance of killing him straight up as well.

Another way around this is to simply keep a copy of A Test of Will in your hand especially for this treachery or to run Eleanor for this quest.

You know you can declare defenders against those aimed attacks? It's the same as an attack "against the first player", with only difference that if attack from the first player is undefended - the damage goes to one of the heroes, while attack against Nalir if undefended - damages Nalir himself instead one of the heroes. You can still defend against it with any of your available characters.

It does make sense... Was thinking it was a rather super nasty treachery considering you'd instantly lose if Bellach or one of his marauders were in the staging area...

Seems like it should be written as an attack against the first player that if undefended must be assigned to Nalir.

(1.41) Attacks against a character
An attack made against a character works the same as an attack made against a player with one exception: undefended damage from an attack against a character must be assigned to that character.

For example: Bilbo Baggins (OtD 1) has the most poison attached when Crazy Cob (OtD 29) is revealed from the encounter deck and its "When Revealed" effect triggers an attack against the character with the most poison attached. Even though the first player controls 3 other heroes, any undefended damage from this attack must be applied to Bilbo Baggins. Because Bilbo is already exhausted from committing to the quest, he cannot exhaust to defend himself and will be killed if the attack is undefended. Knowing this, the first player chooses to exhaust one of his ready characters, Bombur, to declare him as the defender for this attack. At this point, the attack resolves as normal and any damage from the attack is applied to Bombur.

Someone stated earlier they "hate attachments for only one character" and were bemoaning the fact that Warden of Arnor was "only" for Idraen - and yet, here comes the next hero - Haldir - and he's also a scout! I haven't seen anyone mention this, but he's also certainly a nice target for the Warden... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Haldir is just a great hero all round. More options for the Ranger decks, coupled with the synergies with Silvan is really cool. In some ways the big difference between the dwarves is they only have synergies with each other (at least directly, on traits), while the heroes like Haldir can offer multiple options. Wingfoot and Warden of Arnor together is cool! Balin is comparable for the dwarves, I guess, but mostly through his ability.

I'm liking haldir alot too.

Wish faramir had the same stats...

I know, Faramir is dead to me.

 

Haldir with Warden of Arnor and Asfaloth could give you the same location control as Glorfindel w/ Asfaloth, but with the added bonus that you don't have to use Glorfindel for the ten thousanth time.

Well, it was obvious that more scout heroes are coming, otherwise it would be atrocious of them to release such an attachment. I also stated that.

Wow....   that is just crazy nasty... lowering each players threat elimination level to 40....

and if you don't clear it before another four time counters are removed it would go to 30....... insanity!

However the difficulty level for the quest is 4... which is lower than Dunland Trap or Three Trials.

Seems like it would be quite hard to get stuck on stage 1 for that long which must be why the effect is so very nasty. At the same time however many encounter effects also remove time counters... in a four player game where you would start with four Spys from Mordor out if all four were engaged and made an attack then you would already have to lower all four players threat elimination level to 40... nasty.....

 

Also can someone PLEASE spoil the quest cards for trouble in tharbad when possible?  all the player and encounter cards have been spoiled for days.... can we get the quest cards?

Difficulty 4? Hmmm a bit dissappointed about it. Threat level go down by 10? Sound like something new. But difficult 4???? What a f$$$$!

I'm sure Anterlered Crown will be pretty **** tough considering the last quest of a cycle always is.

oh also Haldir is gonna be awesome for this quest, slap a rivendell blade and dagger of westernesse/dunedain mark on him and he can take out Spys before they remove a time counter =) (he would actually be able to take out any enemy minus the marauders and Bellach this way)

What is more, we all know that Difficulty Level 4 doesn't mean anything in this game. Journey Along the Anduin is 4, Into Ithilien also 4 and so on.

 

What really surprises me is the fact that 3 out of 3 quests at the moment shine in originality and fun moments.

I proxied Haldir and have used him so far for 7 games 6 quests (6 victorys) and he is probably my new favorite hero :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Always put my first Rivendell blade and Dagger/Mark on him first now and then others on Legolas.

Here's the quest cards for trouble in tharbad:

1a: set bellach and the crossing at tharbad aside, out of play. Search the encounter deck for 1 copy of Spy from Mordor per player, and add them to the staging area. Make The Empty Mug the active location. The first player takes control of Nalir, as an ally. Shuffle the encounter deck.

1b: Time 4. Forced: after the last time counter is removed from this quest, reduce each players threat elimination level by 10 for the remainder of the game. Then, place 4 time counters on this stage.

Forced: after 1 or more progress is placed on this quest, cancel all progress and reduce each players threat by an equal amount.

When all players have 0 threat, immediately proceed do stage 2.

2a: when revealed: add bellach and crossing at tharbad to the staging area. Then, shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and discard cards from the encounter deck until X Orc enemies have been discarded, where x is the number of players in the game. Add all discarded Orc enemies to the staging area.

2b: Time 3. Forced: after the last time counter is removed from this quest, either raise each players threat by 3 or bellach makes an immediate attack against nalir. Then, place 3 time counters on this stage.

Progress that would be placed on this quest are instead placed on The Crossing at Tharbad.

Forced: after a character leaves play, raise its controllers threat by 2

Wow. That's some cool quest mechanics. Thematically describing an attempt of heroes to elude the pursuit and smuggle Nalir out of the town by turning quest progression into the threat reduction seems extremely cool.

 

P.S.: I've seen many people complaining that new quest do not tolerate secrecy. Well, I may be wrong, but now you got it: the quest perfect for secrecy. If you possess impressive questing power right off the bat, you could easily include secrecy cards even into non-secrecy deck and make your way into the secrecy by intense questing.

I only played it once in a 3 player game, so take my comments with a grain of salt. It does seem

to be on the easier side because questing to lower threat ends up being a bonus for players. Haldir loves this quest in multiplayer because of low treat and I was able to snipe enemies in the staging area or engaged with another player. Still, I had fun playing it. The setting and theme feel new and fresh, but I'm curious to see how it plays solo.

Quest sounds cool and unique. I'm ok with the occasionally easier quest, particularly if it's one that explores innovative new gameplay mechanics. Thanks for the info. 

 

Btw, any idea when we can expect spoilers for the next adventure pack?

This quest looks brutal in solo, but of course I could be wrong. Enemies and treacheries seem extremely powerful, and the orc encounter set from VOI has some pretty tough cards.
