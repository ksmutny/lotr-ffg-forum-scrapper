EDIT- due to this thread being about the current situation of the game, the poll only really works with those who have most of the packs, however if you wish to vote and dont have most of the packs, then please say where you are up to in the game, and then i can add a * next to your vote so it can be differentiated from the other votes (its a shame but unaviodable i think)

 

EDIT 2- i realise that such a thread cannot possible give even an idea of the player base's idea on difficulty due to the amount of variables such as how you play, the amount of cards you have, the time you can commit, experience etc...however what is interesting is that most players still comment on where they think the game is difficulty wise at the moment on other threads so most players must have some sort of idea on what they personally think, so i think it is still worth doing due to this fact. please add comments alongside your vote so we can actually see why you choose your option

 

sorry for the long edits but its worth pointing out i realise this poll is seriously flawed before others do it for me ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

There has been much talk recently about difficulty, more specifically that the game's quests are too easy. I find this strange. Rewind only a little, say 6 months, and this was not so, in fact i seem to remember it being the opposite, the forum had many discussions regarding the high level difficulty of quests such as Ithillien....however games change, players change, even the way we play changes...hence this thread.

 

I wish to get a least a handful of responses, if for nothing else but my own curiosity (and yes, before anyone says it, i am well aware of the maths of statistics, and know this proves nothing....) but i would like to see what the forum thinks, so that next time i am discussing (arguing..) on this subject, at least i and others have a fair idea of what at least the regulars of this forum think (you can see my ideas in the next post)

 

so, here are your choices: (say if you have one that isn't here)

 

THIS GAME, AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS IS......

 

A: Far too easy- the majority of quests can be won without posing even a little challenge, to the point that it is boring

 

B: Getting to easy -due to the power cards that we currently have, they are getting higher compared to the difficulty of the quests

 

C: Mid range- This game is right where it should be. The are plenty of easy quests for theme decks but enough that still kick where it hurts once in a while

 

D: Getting too hard- the increase in enemy and location stats, mixed with bad treacheries is starting to outweigh the player cards available

 

E: Far too hard- quests are completely unbalanced in favour of the enemy

 

F: Depends on the player number- solo is more to the difficult end of the balance, multilplayer is more to the easy end

 

G: Depends on the player number- multiplayer is more to the difficult end of the balance, solo is more to the easy end

 

H-Too hard to say- it varies too much with each cycle and also on how you approach the game (for example its hard if you run theme decks, or easy if you only use the most powerful decks you can)

So my opinion, is C. This game has gone from too hard (mirkwood solo) and too easy (mirkwood mulit) in the first 6-12 months of the game, to just about right for me, even solo and multiplayer. I can win very often with my power decks, but in general, most theme decks, or lesser powered decks, win less, but still a respectable amount

 

it is interesting that there are now quite a few players who say the game is too easy. I am not new to strategy games, i have to say, with all honesty, that i excel at strategic thinking, it is 'my thing' if you like (i am talking more military strategy games here)...so perhaps the reason i win less is that this game has less of a 'forward thinking' aspect of it than warfare strategy games, indeed it is obvious that there is too much luck involved here for this LCG to be considered 'strategy' based, though of course there is some involved

 

or perhaps i just am too interested in the theme and lore of the game, the art of the game, the actual cards themselves, to focus on the actually quest...in fact i look forward to the art most of all.

 

or perhaps i am just not that great at this game, which is fine...i enjoy it at least as much as the next person here....and as i said before, that is what counts. so in short this game is right where it should be for me, and i hope it continues with the same balance

I play this game 100% of the time 2-player co-op with a buddy, and we are making our way through 1-2 quests per month. While we're not caught up, from what we've fought I'd rate this a "C".

 

I have 2 concerns/suggestions:

 

1. I play Spirit/Leadership and my buddy plays Lore/Tactics. Any time we hit something difficulty 6+, I fall back on 25-ish "mandatory" Spirit cards due to their sheer power and have very little deck flexibility. I would love to see some sort of banned list, not in the traditional sense, but as follows:

- Once you reach Heir of Numenor, you may no longer use: Mathom, Unexpected Courage, "Cancel Treachery" (I suck with names), "Cancel Shadow effect", Northern Tracker ... Don't take this literally, just tossed some powerful cards on the list for examples. 

- Once you reach The Dark Riders, add more cards to the list. Can even cycle out older Heroes, which would lead to new creative decks and less stagnant repetition. This also would enable the FFG quest creation team to have more options, as they don't have to account for as many broken combos, which also leads to my 2nd suggestion!

 

2. Less RNG based bombs. I can appreciate a good "Difficulty-8" but to lose a game based on what turn the Balrog gets his Sword is a bit silly. 

 

Other than that, keep up the great work! Love this game and love that there is a fun co-op game on the market.

Great poll :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'm definitely a C. Though I don't play many multiplayer games with more than two. (Don't know if there should be some letters for those playing multiplayer rarely to never, thoughk)

## 5 [Glaurung on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825593)

Is a bit wrong way to ask Rich.

 

Cose there is different players with different approach to the game.

 

If you just wonna quick make a deck without really thinking and win every quest is one approach.  You finish your work day and just play a fun game before he sleep is one story. 

 

If you wonna real challenge use your brain and thinking a lot is another story.

 

there is other question : you are casual player or a deep strategist and tactic?

 

that why we always dont get to the point. We all want different things from the game...... And as i say before you cannot please every one. There is a limit. But since all serous players already leave this forum the answer is clean.

 

Looks for example on the CBOTR guys. they a so rookie as a players was from begin. Now they much, much better. Before they like babes like every thing but now they also start to complain about the game and rules? Why? Since they play a lot an they learn and start to see some flaws and some problems they didn see before.  So for now question is like this:

 

Are you reach the certain level to understand the game is unbalanced, desingners is lazy and you didn have  a challenge anymore. Why i say this? Cose im pretty sure this game can be much better cose i see HON! That was amazing job!

 

And make NM as quick as possible or you start to lose players but is already happen......

@Shtanky and MrThomasschmidt - thanks for voting

@glaurung- i completely understand your point, it does indeed depend, and yet you contradict yourself in your reply...you say 'this depends on how you approach the game' yet you complain all the time about it being too easy....do you not think it is your way you approach the game?

i shall put you down as H- Too difficult to say and have modified it to say 'depends on how you approach the game'

 

i put a C for example, because that is taken across the entire scope of how i play...part of the time i play to win, but most of the time its lighhearted roleplaying into middle earth...so its a C

 

i do think there is an important difference here...even though we decide how we play, even FFG realise (early on in Nate French's time) that we all play differently, almost in a natural without thinking about it sense, hence the player types...bilbo, pippin boromir...so i think it is important that the designers take these into account when making a game and its difficulty.

 

now i have no idea if FFG design like this, but i think that it should (and is) at least be taken into account..it is afterall how they will achieve that golden 'balance' and keep the players happy, becuase, even though you say all the serious players have left (which is incorrect...i am here, and so are many others from the start) there are different types of seriousness....again back to the player types

 

a game's difficulty should not just be based on 'can this game be beaten with a full power deck, if so the give it an X rating for X times it can be beaten' but should be more 'what type of deck does this required to win? a theme deck, or a full power deck?'

 

i realise that there are too many variables to model this poll, but remember i am not trying to make this into something it is not- it is merely for my own curiosity, so for others...try to take a look at the full scope of how you play when voting

For solo would say B

For 2 player C

3-4 player D

So, i guess that is G, but that all depends on H.

This is a complicated question you posed!

## 9 [CJMatos on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825604)

For me the game in general is C.

 

For real solo players, i believe it is going D.

## 10 [danpoage on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825614)

personally: B, but H will always be true for the community as a whole because some players prefer the more thematic decks to just combining all of the most powerful cards. One of the real challenges for the designers is balancing the various expectations of players - giving power-players the player cards and challenging scenarios that they want, while providing thematic players with a more stylistic, fun, experience.

## 11 [richsabre on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825627)

thanks for voting both :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

this is actually the hardest poll to run, due to all the problems, such as the way you approach the game, and esepcially how many packs you have (and what part of the game you are up to)...so this is probably one for those with all the packs, which is unfortunate, becuase it cuts a out a key part of the player base- those who are new to the game (which is of course needed to keep the game alive)

 

i have reflected on this in the first post as an edit

## 12 [Pharmboys2013 on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825647)

I'm going to say C.  I play almost exclusively solo (one handed) so my judgement is based on that perspective.  I like to build a lot of different decks and never use 1 deck for any long length of time so that probably influences my opinion where with thematic decks i see a real struggle to get through where with the power decks it seems smoother and easier.  There are still a fair amount of really hard quests that i think balance the difficulty.

 

i certainly do not envy the job of the designers as i can imagine its quite difficult to satisfy all the individual playstyles

I'm gonna say somewhere in between C and D. I would just say straight out D, but that's not exactly how I feel. I think that the games "more than average" difficulty is a good thing, and I wouldn't consider it "Getting too hard". So... Between C and D I guess.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  However you'd like to interpret that response.

## 15 [lleimmoen on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825661)

Before I answer, or try to, I just want to address one specific point. For me there is no formula where hard equals good, bad equals easy, or vice versa. I dislike quest designs where one card can end the game. I dislike designs where certain set up means nigh impossible and other means fairly easy. I have always found Osgiliath to be a very good design because one card can be pleasant at a certain moment and terrible at other times. It is also a quest where you can run into difficulties even though you've been doing quite well throughout the game. Of course, even that quest is quite dated now, but for the time being it had been almost ideal (though it scaled much in favour of solo play).

 

The quests now tend to do the same, much harder with more players (almost the exact opposite to the early quests).

 

Overall, I don't believe there is a single deck that beats every quest almost every time, I've seen the Outlands, I've seen the Dwarves, I've played them, I've probably played couple thousand games by now. At the same time, I do understand some of you want a constant challenge. And I really think different levels, within the adventure pack, is the way to go. It can please almost everybody. And it should have been considered from the start - but it is easy to be clever now.

 

So, I probably cannot answer with a single letter, I've written way too many of them already. But it is a very timely thread to do.

## 16 [Dain Ironfoot on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825663)

I'd probably lean towards several options, but if I'm pushed to answer, I'd say: C

 

I think the first and third quest of this current cycle are far too easy, with Druadan being difficult multiplayer (it's a pretty swingy quest - most times I've played it it's been brutal two player - but I've played one game where I completely lucked out with the encounter draws and it was a cakewalk win).

 

I agree with so many others that this must be a game that is hard to design for, versus a head-to-head format, on top of the different expectations: some wanting a more RPG feel from a card game, some wanting a real challenge every time, etc etc.

 

I suspect the remaining three quests will ramp up the difficulty, much like RPGs get harder when you level up - but who knows? I still love the game but get disappointed when I didn't have to try to win. I don't need Into Ithilien hard all that time - but Cair Andros, Battle of 5 Armies, and others are challenging enough - and thematic enough - to keep me satisfied!

 

All in all, there is more I love about the game than dislike - so I hope it has a healthy, long future ahead!

## 17 [HeavyKaragh on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825674)

I'd say game went from D to C. I think two things have changed since the ending of Dwarrodelf cycle:

 * The better card pool. Mostly, the apperance of the all-mighty Outlands along with the raised quality of the cards in Tactics pool.
 * The change in difficulty from "more players, less difficulty" to "more players, higher difficulty".

This should apply to good, experienced players with complete card pool.

FFG should give us more treats for doing their market research for them.

 

Anyway, I vote D, but not because it's getting too difficult, in fact I think it's getting a little easier but it's still somewhat difficult to me. Also, I own everything x1 except emyn muil, druadan forest and amon din, and play almost exclusively solo.

## 20 [Samwise Gamgee on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825750)

Given that I have not played the Against the Shadow cycle, I would vote C as well. I play two-player and solo. There are definitely those breathe and beat quests, but those are actually a good relief from the harder quests. My personal preference is cool game mechanics over difficulty because there are ways to boost difficulty. In the rules, they describe expert mode where you link quests together while keeping all damage and some other things. I also think that in hopes of the game's longevity, quest difficulty cannot be tailored to the expert user. New entrants to the game would likely be turned off if they had to play catch up on all of the packs just to enjoy the recent (and readily available) Adventure Packs. I agree that the expert players' experience also plays an important part to the longevity of the game and the Nightmare variants of the quests should be more readily accessible.

H. I was going to say D, but I think H, as much as it is a non-answer, fits the mark for me. 

 

I play exclusively solo, with one deck, and while I own four core sets, I play with only one. But that's by the by. 

 

The Mirkwood cycle was just tremendous fun for me, it's like this game's Golden Age. The quests were excellent, challenging, and a lot of fun. Then KD and Dwarrowdelf cycle emerged and the fun went, to be replaced by this endless orc swarm that just turned me off from the game completely. The game became a chore to get through, and I was buying expansions to just stick them on the shelf, and not play them. But then On the Doorstep arrived, and it felt like the clouds were lifting. The quests are becoming fun again! I've only played one quest from HoN so far, and only have the first pack in AtS, but it does feel like a level of enjoyability (the spellchecker tells me this isn't a word, but it should be!) is returning. 

 

Overall, I would say it does depend on what you want from a game. What I want from this game is an enjoyable experience in Middle Earth, high theme and fun, with a bit of challenge. I don't want to be demolished from the moment I draw my starting hand, which is what it felt like for most of last year. I have high hopes for AtS, but I still fear that there will be some quests that are nothing more than the mindless "let's kill some orcs" kind of thing. Maybe there should have been an "I" option, for "it was fine, then it got tough, but now it's getting better"!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 28 [player1761766 on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825866)

Ah, that Road was a long one! I am a bit undecided about it to be honest. I share your oft-mentioned thoughts on 1A needing a magnificent 20 progress tokens, Rich, but the endless procession of orcs and goblins does tire me out, and there aren't enough interesting locations to keep me interested. It's a shame, as it's the pack that has Crebain in! I could take or leave it, to sum up. 

 

Dwarrowdelf on the whole tends to be overshadowed by two quests that I find to be the ones I dislike in the entire game - Watcher in the Water, and Shadow & Flame. Redhorn Gate was pretty good, Long Dark was pretty good, and Foundations of Stone was excellent, but a blase Road to Rivendell, and those two horrible things, leave a sour taste in my mouth for the whole cycle. 

 

I feel I should return to the Dwarrowdelf soon, though. It has been a year, and we have so many awesome dwarf cards now after the Hobbit boxes, that my opinions might change... though I doubt Shadow & Flame will ever be one to enjoy...!

## 29 [richsabre on July 29, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=825904)

yes, i also think shadow and flame is possibly the worst of all quests to date. i rather like watcher in the water, though mostly becuase i love the dark theme of the entrance to moria in the book, and of course the watcher itself is great. it is possibly a weaker quest becuase it is a little linear, but the art on the doors of durin is great (for once we having something tolkien actually did himself to work on so so it should be!)

I vote "B" but only because of HoN, those were quite challenging and hard (and fun) to beat. Most of the older quests became much easier with the ever growing card pool and growing experience in deck building. I don't wanna say the game got boring but it's not much fun to play a quest for the first time and to know right from the start that you'll win at least in the second game. HoN (and Hobbit 1 in a different way) changed this imo. The quest design was taken to another level and I enjoyed them very much.

I own everything released so far (1 core) except hobbit 2 (the german release is errr not right on schedule...), the AtS quests lie around here unplayed due to lack of spare time.

## 33 [Khamul The Easterling on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=826052)

B - There just arn't enough hard quests left. I can only name Dol Guldur,Return to Mirkwood, Maybe Foundations of stone, Watcher in the water, Cair Andros and although I do not own them, I suppose The 2 POD quests are hard. (although I hear MaO is getting much easier now too.)  Even FFG thinks its a "B" since they are making nightmare mode.  Looks like they are doing a half and half in this current cycle.  First three easy, last three hard.   Looks like we have plenty of hard stuff in the future.  Just will take awhile.

thanks for voting.

@khamul- i wouldnt say ffg think it is B (well i wouldnt say i knew anything of what they are thinking) just becuase of nightmare mode. looking at it from the other side they are making easy mode as well. in fact it would be most interesting indeed to see what the designers and playtesters think this is.

Definitely H for me. There are just too many variables, and it's always changing. Just recently, there were a bunch of posts on BGG and even here when HoN came out, saying that the game had become too hard and was alienating players. I really liked HoN, and many players seem to enjoy it more now. Of course, now some are saying the game is too easy. For me personally, it feels about right, at least from the perspective of enjoying the game. Perhaps switching away from super powerful decks to good yet entertaining mono-sphere decks has helped my experience with the newest cycle.

## 36 [klaymen_sk on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=826380)

H for me as well and unless there will be enough variation within the various deck types (at least on Dwarven level), I will still say H.

## 37 [Courchevel on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=826382)

The fact is that the player decks are getting stronger and stronger at each new release.
Would you play without Arwen in a spirit deck, would you forget Gondorian Shield when using Beregond ?
But not the quest and encounter cards (not speaking yet about NM version as not available for me).

Solo :
My feeling is that most of the quests are easy and few times (2 or 3) too easy to enjoy.
On the other hand, there is a couple of quests that are too difficult in solo mode compare to the rest (3rd of Core set and 3rd of HoN) => you need to have a deck tuned specificaly for these quests

Multiplayer :
I have the chance to have a bunch of players with whom I regularly play 4 or 3 players games.
Here the difficulty of the quests, though higher most of the time than solo, is less important for us. The deckbuilding are much more interesting (having to take into account the uniqueness limit for all and the synergies between each deck).
The experiences are richer and the fun is coming more for discussion on how to pass through and cooperation than on succeeding a difficult quest.

As a conclusion, I would say that high difficulty is probably what I would seek for solo play, considering that I can anyway easily restart 3 or 4 quests helping me to tune my deck and improve it.
But I rather play multiplayer as it is, so far, my best memories of the game. And for multiplayer games, I realy enjoy the game as it is today : various quests with different mechanisms, some realy easy, some truly hard.

I would say somewhere between B and C for a solo player.  Most of the new quests have provided a good challenge, but the last two are quite easy for a solo play.  I'll go with C for a final answer.

 

Pretty funny how some players think there are only a couple challenges, while a ton of posts on BGG are overwhelmed with the difficulty.  There are a few 'power decks' that can handle almost any quests with a good % chance of victory, but once I use those decks a few times, I want to try something new.  Luckily for me Tracker1 is an amazing deck-builder so for someone not as creative, I can grab one of those and go(currently running Legolas and his Bow, which although not worth trying certain quests(Watcher, Shadow), it is amazingly fun in others(JDtA, Redhorn, Road to Rivendell).

Yes, I don't think that this game is too easy... Not in the slightest. I don't use "power decks" and I probably never will. I get bored of the decks I make VERY easily, so I'm constantly making new decks. Right now I'm playing through the Hobbit quests with another person, and I think that having 2 people play really makes a difference in difficulty and in enjoy-ability.

It really depends where we are in game's printing cycle as well.

 

When people complained the game was too hard, we were stuck at end of cycle (shadow and flame) + PoD expansion (laketown) + Delux expansion (Heirs of Numenor).

 

The game needs to have a climatic ending, so end of cycle needs to be hard.

PoD scenarios are gencon specials that are developed to be hard.

Delux Expansions should be (from marketing point of view) difficult enough that you would want to buy the Cycles when it laucnhes.

 

At the same time, the Hobbit movies and the Saga Expansions hyped up the game a little, and there were lot of new players trying to play latest adventure packs with minimal card pools... so people with Core Set + only the latest expansion (HoN) was bound to have an unpleasant entry to the game.

 

 

 

Now we are in between 3rd and 4th AP of the Cycle.

 

We have received half the player cards that were meant to be played while playing Heirs of Numenor and Against the Shadow Cycle (as they were developed at the same time),

 

Adventure Cycle can't start with high difficulty, or else last adventure pack will be just too hard, so the latest adventure packs we've gotten are 'easier' packs of this Cycle.

 

We are given yet another keyword that is very powerful (Outlanders), so there are one more options of playing while making cutting-edge deck; so people who have refused to use dwarves for thematic reasons and found the game too hard can now have their powerhouse deck too.

 

As pointed out before, Steward's Fear (1st AP of Cycle) gave much better starting point for new comers than Heirs of Numenor.

 

 

In my opinion, the game always had mostly easy quests, but always one or two really tough or odd quests so one cannot simply steamroll every quests of Cycle. (like Return to Mirkwood and Journey to Rhosgobel for Mirkwood Cycle, or Shadow and Flame and Road to Rivendell/Foundation of Stone for Dwarrowdelf). So from the list, I'd say game's always been C, and will be C for the foreseeable future.

 

However, unless FFG times the release of upcoming Saga Expansions really well, I can almost gurantee people will go back to complaining how difficult the game is around the time next delux expansion is released.

By that time we would once again be left with Last Adventure pack of Cycle (difficult), Stone of Erech print on demand (extremely difficult), and the delux expansion (difficult) as the newest expansions, and (hopefully) have larger base of new players who got sucked into game by the release of LotR Saga Expansions.

Most of those posts are either from new players, who are yet to learn the game mechanics, or from players who tried the game, deemed it too hard and ran away screaming. In fact, in such threads are many players who give advice what to do.

> The Mirkwood cycle was just tremendous fun for me, it's like this game's Golden Age. The quests were excellent, challenging, and a lot of fun. Then KD and Dwarrowdelf cycle emerged and the fun went, to be replaced by this endless orc swarm that just turned me off from the game completely. The game became a chore to get through, and I was buying expansions to just stick them on the shelf, and not play them. But then On the Doorstep arrived, and it felt like the clouds were lifting. The quests are becoming fun again! I've only played one quest from HoN so far, and only have the first pack in AtS, but it does feel like a level of enjoyability (the spellchecker tells me this isn't a word, but it should be!) is returning. 

I agree with much of that. Khazad and Dwarrodelf quests are quite awful compared to the Mirkwood cycle. I think I must have played the latter (or former chronologically) at least 10 times as much. And I don't think I will ever replay them save perhaps the Redhorn Gate or the Watcher (which is intriguing).

 

Luckily, the quests got much better again with HoN, but I'm yet to play any of the AtS.

 

I much hope the LotR saga will be the highlight of the whole thing. I liked the Hobbit saga but it doesn't pose much replay-ability for me.

Overrall I vote E. The game is just too hard for the most part even with all the expansions giving us new cards.

 

I play solo for the most part with the occasional 2-3 player game and almost every time the game wins because it is far too difficult. The emphasis is too much on the threat deck and the threat ratings.

## 50 [JonofPDX on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87391-game-difficulty-poll/?do=findComment&comment=827811)

I feel like the majority of the game rests squarely in the “C” category for me, occasionally drifting into D territory but usually in areas where it’s SUPPOSED TO (Massing or Lake-Town).

 

There are some quests, though, that ARE too hard—largely due to some lacking game design. Back in the day it was Escape From Dul Goldor (fun for multiplayer, but ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE w/ solo w/ a single core set). In the modern era, the best example would likely be Into Ithilian. Even Druadan Forest, while not that hard for MY decks, can destroy you if you aren’t running a deck that can handle the archery.

 

Honestly, though—I think the biggest thing the game designers could do to help smooth out the difficulty is to give players more ways to deal w/ treacheries. They are the make or break point of most “hard” scenarios and add the greatest amount of randomness to the game.

 

And before someone says it—yes, I know: Eleanor. But Eleanor is a core set card that is HARD to run in a modern deck. Gondor really hasn’t helped her that much. A Test of Will is only a 2x copy unless you buy multiple core sets. And if you are planning to deal w/ them via encounter deck manipulation then you have to build a deck strategy around that—which for a lot of people (myself included) is a terribly boring/mechanical deck to run. I’m not saying we need a “when revealed” Balin, but SOMETHING would help to allow a greater variety of decks to compete against the more difficult scenarios.

Hey Rich! Great post. Very interesting. For my part, I vote a "C." This game is spot on. It is awesome, and it is becoming more balanced all the time. There is a wide range of scenario difficulty available to all players, no matter how much one likes easy or difficult.

The reason he (and sometimes myself) cant enjoy the game somtimes, is because many many quests are so easy that you beat them without thinking and blow right through the quest stages and when its over your like "wow what just happened?" "I beat it that easy?" The reason the hard quests are much more fun is because you really have to use all your best strategys, spend time thinking about if you should quest with ____ amount of characters or whatever, and you really are "playing" the game rather than on an easy quest all you do is commit tons of characters to the quest and defeat all the little enemies without hardly even noticing it.

it has been enlightening reading this poll and its comments, and i thank everyone who has/will be voting. what is personally interesting to me is your comment above khamul.

 

if i take for example, other games i play, strategic military ones most with a steeper learning curve than this one, i will spend sometimes 20 minutes planning moves before i commit. i put an enormous amount of thought into it, and i am successful, even at hard difficulty levels...so what i feel there must be what you, glaurung and others feel here.

 

what is interesting is that i dont put anywhere near the amount of thought into this game when i am planning. anyone who has ever watched me play (only a handful of people that is) will know i sometimes rush into moves, often messing up....why do i do this?

 

well my theory is the 'bilbo' inside me is too dominant for me to get any (or rather much) 'boromir' fun out of this game....i just dont see it as the strategy game like others i play. that is not to say it isn't, becuase it is, i just dont treat it as one. i am too busy admiring the art, thinking up themes, rp-ing.

 

therefore what i think i will do, even just once or twice, is to play it as purely 'boromir'....forget that i am playing in tolkien's world, treat the cards as statistics.. and see how that goes...perhaps i shall have an enlightening experience, perhaps i shall still lose as much! who knows..

 

other players of course probably dont share my ideas on this, as i know many players both enjoy the theme and get a lot of boromir enjoyment out of this game, whereas i have always treated this as an 'immersion' game, rather than a challenge.

 

..so, that is a rather rambling post that has more to do with my own thoughts than anything else (it isn't my way of saying 'this is why i lose...it isnt becuase i suck ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]..incase you were wondering ), but i just thought id share them, as i see now more than ever how much the player types determine our (or at least my own) success, even if we dont realise it.

Rich: You're welcome! Thanks for the great thread!

 

Khamul: I understand your points; they are certainly valid! As to being disappointed with certain "easier" scenarios, there are ways to make them harder. Two come to mind chiefly: 1) add nightmare variant cards to them to make them harder (I know that there are only so many "nightmare" cards available at the moment), and 2) try playing with a wider selection of cards, i.e. not just the ones that are the most powerful. 

 

As to not playing with the most powerful cards, well, some players just find it too hard to not play with the cards that are obviously, in a strictly mechanical way, the best cards for the resource price. I understand this, but I don't choose to play this way alone, because, when I do, I end up leaving well over half the player cards I have purchased in a box collecting dust, while continually recycling the same old strategies...at least until more "powerful" cards are released. 

 

Anyway, to each their own! As for my take on this game, there are plenty of options for all! Happy gaming!

I have 1 core set and all expansions/APs released to date.  My vote is C.  

 

However, I think a more interesting poll may be what people think about how fun the scenarios are to play as that is perhaps a more important consideration than difficulty level (maybe a poll for another thread).

a) Getting more fun with each cycle

b) Staying the same

c) Getting less fun with each cycle

 

 

In my opinion, so far the developers have done an excellent job making each scenario unique and with a slight variation of the core mechanics and I would vote a) above.  However, there is only so much variation one can come up with to the core mechanics before it would become somewhat repetitive I think and I wonder how far away that point is?

I think you just nailed it there rich ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] looking at this fantastic frased sentence something is dimming for me. "Forgetting I'm playing in Tolkiens world" and "treat the cards as statistics" isn't something I think is on the developers minds. In fact, I find this incompatible with Tolkien in general. If this is how a person is to play a Tolkien game I don't think you'll get very much satisfaction. Not for very long. Maybe if it was just a "cold" strategy game without lore, but as this is more a lore based game (with the quests and all) I think that people that want a heavy challenging strategy game quickly will be/is why they are disappointed.

People are of cause welcome to put whatever they want into whatever game and play them for whatever reason. I just don't think you can blame the designers too much if you want something out of a game that it isn't.

thank you my friend :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] indeed i agree, the designers have obviously read well into the books and material, in fact more so than what i thought when i first bought this game.

so yes, you make a good point- i also do not think the desingers go into the planning thinking of the cards as numbers...it would certainly show if they did it this way, and there would be no clever hints at the lore of middle earth, such as denethor's ability etc.

 

so, when one reads it that way, then it is easy to see how it is hard for the designers to make quests both thematically rich and challenging to the point where you need all your strategic wits to win....but i think they do very well at this balance all the same. quests such as osgilliath (POD) are player favourites, and still remain so, and i think this is becuase of the successfuly challenge-theme balance the designers have got right

I vote D.

 

I only own everything through Darrowdelf.  I play solo, but with two decks (emulate two players).

 

All quests are winnable, I don't like powerdecking.  I like theme.  I like campaigns, i.e. stringing quests together vs. doing a single mission.  I prefer to create a single deck and go through, I really dislike creating new decks.  It is a chore for me...I'd rather go to work and do my career because I at least get paid for that.

 

The game is more about building your deck then actually immersing yourself into missions.  That is where this is an epic fail for me.

 

I vote D because I cannot just choose cards I like and have a shot.  As many mentioned, you have tons of choices for cards and heroes, but you'd be a fool to exclude certain ones.  It's like making a boardgame with melee and casting characters and you only stand a chance if you use the casting characters and the melee ones are nerfed.

 

If I take the time to powerdeck it, I'm sure it would be C or better...but I honestly spend more time building my deck than I actually do playing and immersing myself into a mission.  There is something wrong with that.

 

I don't mind Legendary, even though it takes forever to put away and set up, because the game itself lasts a while.  Games like Descent are fun because even though there is setup time between quests and encounters, there is a string and a progression and a feeling of epicness.

 

This game is a series of independent missions.  Nothing more.  I get that many of you love it.  I just don't.

Rich, I vote for D, almost I wanted to say E.

 

In the last couple of weeks my playergroup mainly tried the most difficult quests like Ithilien, Laketown, Cair Andros, even Druadan forest is insane with 3 players, not thinking about 4. Playing those quests made me realize how ridiculous certain quests are due to difficulty and this lowered my game-fun significantly (although i see myself as a very experienced player). This is very sad. Its not that I would not be able to create apropriate decks to beat those scenarios, of course I have them, but I am kind of bored of the 90%-use of Glorfindel and Dain-Decks.

I like to play with the full amount of available heroes, but its just not possible to play some of the news quests with this wish.

As a result I found myself now in the Easy-Mode (playing solo, normal in MP) which increased the game-fun very much. My actual deck contains the heroes Gloin, Boromir Leadership and Bifur and I love them.

 

Thats all I have to say about difficulty.

I'd say C - it's just about right at the moment. I think with the introduction of standard/easy/nightmare that will continue to be the case. If thats handled right, it should keep the difficulty level just right for everyone.

Yeah Rich: I consider Long Dark one of the easier quests available. It is quite conditional isn't it? If you fail too many location tests and draw that card that raises your threat by 7, then yeah, it is killer. But, generally, I always am successful against this quest.

Try with 2 players or better 4. you will see big difference.

About TLD I wrote that it seems worse, hadn't try it by the time. Indeed it must be easier than WitW

 

I tried one game yesterday evening, lost but on the first three turns out of the encounter deck came a card that made two damage to each of my character unless I passed the locate test (failed after discarding 4 cards!!!) , and another I had to raise threat by seven ... with a troll already there I had not best of luck. I had mainly a rohan deck

 

I do not use cards that came after TLD pack (even though I have all the packs) and as I played through it I got the idea that with a dwarf deck it should be easy ....

I feel D. 

 

(But I'm never a solo player)  Although I play multiplayer solo at times to test.

I would say C. I didn't really care one way or another about the game back when it came out but played regularly with an enthusiastic friend and I really like every quest out there that I have tried so far. I'm not even much of a power gamer and as long as we don't loose on the first turn ie bad luck, I even enjoy loosing.
