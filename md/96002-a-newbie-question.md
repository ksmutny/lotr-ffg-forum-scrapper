In a deck that contains both spirit and tactics cards(for example),in order to pay for a spirit card i must use the recource tokens of a spirit hero, right? i cant pay for a spirt card by using tokens of a tactic hero , right?

Thx in advance :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]
