 im not so sure about the contents of where the quest might go, but what are peoples thought in looking at the other LCG's. DO we think that the 6th one that has not been anounced will be a larger expansion?

No. Looking at previous LCGs the most likely thing is a second AP cycle consisting of 60 card packs followed by a larger deluxe expansion.

 I think the news releases about LotRtCG have implied that the last Adventure Pack in the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle will be some sort of returning to Mirkwood quest.  I'm just not sure which news release it was that I read that in.

It will be disappointing if after we are done with mirkwood, we will get another cycle and not a deluxe pack.

I have no interested in the monthly expansions, but I'm lookink forward for a big expansion, like for othe LCG's - 165 cards is enough to add a new hero to each sphere, half-a-dozen new cards in tripilcates - giving us a "legal" 50-card deck per sphere. And of course a new quest-chain of three quests and assorted encounter decks.

It will be great if it will include a third threat counter (and marketable as a 3 player expansion...)

Have any other LCGs released a deluxe pack after their first cycle of expansions? I would start to prepare yourself for disappointment .

I thought Warhammer did... is that not correct?

Edit: I just looked it up, the first large expansion for W:I actually came out BEFORE the 5th pack of the first expansion cycle! So I think it's entirely possible that we'll get a deluxe expansion after the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle.

Good find, Narsil.  I hope we get a big box soon.  Warhammer may not be a good model, since it was missing two factions when they game was released.  There were High Elf and Dark Elf cards, but you could not play either faction.  I am unsure of the LotR LCG has the same pressing need for a big box that we saw with Warhammer.  We can hope.

Im wondering if they will change it up for the lord of the rigs game. I wager they might have one  delux to start off each cycle.

I say this because we have the core which gives us the base for the quests. If they are to give us a delux witha  few different quests, doesnt it seem logical that they will be the first ones of the quest like the core set..?

 

thoughts on that idea?
