I can't find clarification in the rule book for this:  If you have progress tokens and remove a traveled to location, any extra tokens (if there are some) go onto the current quest card.  What if you complete a quest card and have extra progress tokens?  Do those go onto the next quest card automatically?  Or are they discarded?

Active locations (rule book, p. 14): "Note that if there is an active location (see page 15), progress tokens are placed on that location until it is explored, and the remainder are then placed on the current quest."

Quest cards (rule book, p. 22): "Players immediately advance to the next stage of a quest as soon as they place a number of progress tokens equal to or greater than the number of quest points the current quest card has. Additional progress tokens earned against the quest do not carry over to the next stage."

So, progress tokens do spill over from active locations to the active quest card, but they do not carry over from one quest card to the next.
