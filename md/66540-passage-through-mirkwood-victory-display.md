Now that cards with victory points are placed in a "Victory Display" how does that affect Ungoliant's Spawn if it is defeated before going to 3B: Don't Leave the Path? Since it's no longer part of the Encounter Deck nor the Encounter Deck's discard pile, does that mean a player has automatically won the scenario? The player pulls out a regular spider? Or, U.S. does get removed from the Victory Display?

Thanks!

Ungoliant's Spawn does not carry any VPs, so the question doesn't arise.

PS However, we do know in the general case that cards can be fetched back out of the victory display in this sort of situation - Nate French ruled that this would apply to Caradhras in TRG if it has been explored before completing stage 2 of the quest.

Generally true, but there is a way in which Ungoliant's Spawn can wind up in the victory display: Out of the Wild. In that case, players would not be able to retrieve it (since the effect on "Don't Leave the Path!" only allows players to search the encounter deck and discard pile). This creates a scenario in which victory is literally impossible.

Hm, good point. The difference is that Caradhras simply states "Caradhras becomes the active location" without specifying any restrictions. Therefore, as ruled, it can be fetched from the victory display.
