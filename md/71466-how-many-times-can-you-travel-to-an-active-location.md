 Sorry in advance if this has been answered.

 

I am playing solo using the tactics deck and still trying to beat passage through mirkwood for nigh on the 10th time. After questing I would make the Old forest road the active location, thereby readying a hero. Spider comes down due to threat, and attacks and I defend with the hero.

Round 2, if questing does not satisfy the requirements to put sufficient tokens on the travel location to discard it. Can I travel to that location again? Could I ready a hero?

So in a 2 player game, would only the first player get to travel to that location, even when the 2 player becomes the active player?

hey

the location stays active until cleared, so no you cannot re-travel

you can of course re travel if the location is forced back into the staging area (possible in some quests and cards)

Just to say, pure tactics is very difficult to play with because you don't get very much willpower.

Ok good, I just got this game and thought I was doing something wrong, I switched to Lore last night and got a little further than with the tactics deck. The allies contribute willpower and the snares are nice. But I still can't seem to get my threat to stay under 50. It seems you either commit all your characters to the quest to maximize progress, but then you have no cards for defense and your heroes die. 

I think I just need to play more…..but even though I lost like 10 or more games, it still is really fun to play.

once you've made a location active, you can ignore its threat when you're counting up all the threat in the staging area for questing. are you remembering to do that? (that is a rule i missed when i started playing, and it gave me a few frustrating loses)

Also, engaged enemies are no longer considered as in the staging area, so their threats are not count towards determining the success or failure of the quest phase.

Yeah definitely have been doing that, and when the enemies engage have been not using their threat either. 

It just seems that my allies die and I become overwhelmed with enemies and the heroes take too much damage and my threat level skyrockets

 

Oh well I will try with other decks.

what you need is someone who can do two things in one round -- someone who can quest AND attack, or quest AND defend.

here is an easy combo you could try… use aragorn and theodred together. aragorn can ready himself after questing if you spend a token. and theodred can give him an extra token every round. so you can quest with those two together, and still have your third person, plus aragorn, available to defend and attack. that should tide you over until you get loads of allies and other cards out.

Thanks! I took your advice and just finally beat passage through Mirkwood with a score of 48.
