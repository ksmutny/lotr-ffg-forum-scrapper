I've just received my Fog on the Barrow Downs from a UK retailer, so it's finally made it to shops over here. Just one query - how many cards (including the front and back card) should there be? I am getting 54.

 

The originally Fellowship page, located here - https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2014/6/18/find-a-route-through-fog-on-the-barrow-downs/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2014/6/18/find-a-route-through-fog-on-the-barrow-downs/] - talks about 55 but also mentions the alternative Aragorn art card which was for taking part in the Fellowship event.

 

Later solicitations for Fog mentions 54, as in here -

and here

and on the product page -

 

https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-fog-on-the-barrow-downs/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/products/the-lord-of-the-rings-fog-on-the-barrow-downs/]

 

so I am guessing I have the full set right? The back card is counted as part of the 54?

Thanks in advance :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
