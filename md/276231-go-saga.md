I currently have core, kazad fun, return to mirk, journey to ros, and massing at OS. 

I'm finding it hard to find a source to buy mirkwood cycle. Or the darrowdel. So I was thinking of switching to the sagas. 

Are there boxes designed to be played  without the addition of expansions? I assume they want the core. 

If it is adviced to try them out, should I go 1st with hobbit, which 8m inclined to do, or the Lord of the rings. 

Thanks. 

 

Sorry about all the short forms. I'm cellphone inputting.

You can play the sagas with just a core set and the boxes. Either should be ok to start with but most people prefer the LotR saga over the hobbit ones for the quests.

The designers intended the sagas to be playable with only them and one core set, but with only the first of each series is that really possible. Expect it to be hard.

Does this mean that I should be buying both Hobbit boxes at once?

Overhill and under hill and On the doorstep, for example.

You don't need one to play the other. You can buy On the Doorstep for instance and play that with just the Core. The Sagas are meant to be played in order because they follow the narratives of the books. But if you're familiar with the books already then you can play the Sagas in any order. Campaign play on-the-other-hand is different and will require playing them in order.

Is there more narrative than what I have already seen? Or is it about the same?

There is a significant narrative increase once you get up to the ring maker cycle (voice of Isengard). 

I would encourage you to get both hobbit boxes when you do because people are always saying they cannot find the one or the other when they are ready for it.

The player cards in the Hobbit boxes also work well with the cards you have in Khazad Dum [assorted Dwarf-related stuff] and Return to Mirkwood [Dain].
