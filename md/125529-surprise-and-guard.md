Hi Guys,

 

When I first bought this game I nearly threw all the cards on the ground and burnt them out of frustration at loosing every time. Now... I get it, just about... and am really enjoying adjusting the deck to suit the scenario. Thank you FFG for an amazing game!

 

I've searched through this forum and BoardGameGeek for clear answers to these questions but not come across anything, so hoped you guys could help.

 

Two really simple questions..

 

1. When you reveal a guarded card, you then reveal another encounter card to 'guard' it. That's simple enough. My question is, if you do not claim the card after dealing with it's guard, does the next encounter card that is revealed, perhaps the next round, 'reguard' the guard card, or does the guarded card remain unguarded until claimed?

 

2. Can you or can you not legally use 'Surprise Attack' with 'Gandalf'... i.e. reuse Gandalf by putting him back into your hand as per 'Surprise Attack''s instructions?

 

Thanks for your help guys, really appreciate it.

I don't know about you first question.

If you mean sneak attack in your second question the answer is yes. You can use sneak attack to reuse Gandalf.

1- It doesn't get a second card attached to it as its effect only takes place when it's revealed.

2- By "surprise attack" I'm sure you mean "Sneak Attack" and so yes, it is perfectly legal to use it on the Gandalf ally.

It's really wonderful how people come up with questions that wouldn't pop up unless you read "outside" of the rulebook.

I mean, this first question... ok, lets refer to the rulebook:

"The guarded keyword is a reminder on some objective cards to reveal and attach the next card of the encounter deck to the objective when it enters the staging area from the encounter deck, and place them both in the staging area."

How? How do you lead yourself to asking this question with such clear rulebook definition of this keyword?

Wow MyNeighbourTrololo, your name suits you. Must be very frustrating for you and your clearly superior intelligence to be harassed by us mere mortals.

 

Thank you everyone else for the replies, really helpful as always. Looking forward to playing again. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I remember the guard concept confused the hell out of me, too, when I started playing.

 

Don't by shy to ask silly questions here - our troll ratio is below 5 percent.

I'm fine, spasibo! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Had a lot of learning stress during the last month, fortunatly the Ringmaker Cycle came out in Germany only two weeks ago, after my tests were already over.

 

Right now I'm struggling against The Road Darkens - just won the second scenario by sacrifing Gandalf - only to realize that I forgot to let the Balrog attack during the adventure phase (again...).

So it doesn't get guarded if it enters from the encounter discard pile, correct?

No reason it should.
