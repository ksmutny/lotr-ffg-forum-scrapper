So is there any news on the german sites (there always seems to be some spoiled stuff from somewhere I'm Europe) that fill out any more cards from Ghost of Framsburg?

Dain

Valiant determination 

Mirkwood hunter 

Man the Walls 

Warrior Sword

 

I'm eager for mining interactions, there has got to be a card in this pack that synergizes with the new Dain

Since there is many languages and many website that give information in Europe that create more way to leak (officially or unofficially) the cards. I still think that many of the spoils come in english first, and usually the first language released is in english. I never hear anything about Ghost of Framburg 😕

Hall of Beorn doesn't even have the pack listed yet. Are there any other sites that keep track of spoiled cards? While I appreciate the OPs list of cards that I can go back to the main article to look up, I'd like to look at the pack as a whole as it gets updated/spoiled. Any good links?

I don't understand how it can already be IN STORES in Quebec and this website hasn't released details on packs 5 and 6 yet...

What is your guess as to the number in Man the Walls?

I am quite torn. I feel and hope it will be 2 because 1 would be too bad in comparison to many cards, and only have a slight edge in coop (with the limitations still). The 2 however, would be amazing, I think, especially as there are many allies in Leadership (and Tactics) that need not quest. And as if that card needed any boost, it would go great with a Very Good Tale.

> 11 minutes ago, lleimmoen said:

My guess is 1, hope is 2.

I dont think it would be 2 just because there are so many types decks that reduce the cost by 1 already. If there was a four player game running dale (king of dale), silvan (o lorien), noldor (to the sea, to the sea), and rohan (spirit theoden), playing this card basically means everyone puts a 3 cost ally in for free. Even at the cost of no questing that seems too generous.

Of course, I don't know if this technically stacks with some of those because they have minimums. But what if you trigger their abilities and then play the card.

Hmm. Could be, but would they obscure it to create a negative surprise in future? I know there are many near useless cards for solo, but I think they have been much less common in more recent cycles. And take MtW w/1: you only can play it in planning, it only works for your ally, and the ally cannot quest that round; it pales badly in comparison to other leadership resource accelerators.

## 20 [lleimmoen on December 1, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3553931)

As for others, I have been trying the Hunter in Haldan decks and he seems to be much better than the traveller from the other pack: often got him into play for 1 or less, and of course he is not bad for 2, either.

How about the blade, I am glad to see more generic weapons, especially those that can go to allies. And I really like the Swift and Strong (and so does Haldir).

Man the Walls at 1 is not very impressive for resource acceleration -- but it is free, which helps a lot.  I'd *love* that card solo in my hand, turn one, with ally Treebeard.

I like the blade a lot.  Minimum +1 in most cases, can go on a wide range of characters, nice and cheap.

## 22 [Amicus Draconis on December 1, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3554029)

It costs the same as Wealth of Gondor or Gaining Strength and it does in effect the same without requirements save for playing an ally. And all players benefit from it.

Not a preorder. I've seen both (Fires and Framsburg) on the shelf. Website even has quantities in stock.

I would very much ADORE to see spoilers for that pack. If you end up getting it and post the pictures I'd ve eternally grateful.

Yes please, spoil us.

And yes guys, you are probably right. I mean, I myself was thinking 2 would be too good, and pretty much an auto-include to any ally deck with Leadership. With 1, I will probably be disappointed though. The coop makes sense but in solo, Wealth or Strength are less restricted in use and timing.

## 27 [dalestephenson on December 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3554714)

Wealth and Strength have restrictions of their own.  Wealth of Gondor just gives you the resource, but requires a Gondor hero; better in solo if you have one, but useless if you don't.  Gaining Strength requires discarding two resources to gain three, that can be a severe practical restriction.  Neither gets better in multiplayer.  But as I typically don't put either in my solo decks, this card will likely have the same fate.

## 28 [Halberto on December 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3554717)

But even 1 cost reduction in 3-4 players can be very usefull especially in early game. Not an auto include but a serious candidate to be considered. 

At 2 cost reduction would be OP. 

Not sure I really would like it to be honest. 

## 29 [lleimmoen on December 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3554809)

And that is sort of the problem, I am not saying that at 1 it will be a clearly worse card than Wealth or Strength, but I hardly ever play those, the latter I find good in Erestor and Arwen hero line-up (once Cirdan has Narya). The former is clearly better for all decks Gondor but I still hardly have it in them...

But again, after proxying it as 2 I definitely agree it would be among the strongest out there... probably ready for a quick errata soon after.

## 30 [lleimmoen on December 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3554812)

Has someone tried Swift and Strong? Seems just the card missing in my Haldir decks where he wants to hit twice in a round and there are not many natural readying effects within Lore and Tactics...

I'm pretty sure I got this:

Soldier of Erebor, leadership ally, dwarf, warrior, 5/0/3/3/3

Action: Discard the top 3 cards of your deck to ready Soldier of Erebor. (Limit once per round).

 

Familiar Lands, lore event, 1

Reduce by 1 the cost to play attachment on Descendant of Girion

Would you please post picturesof those last 2? I'm a huge fan of artifacts in this game and have been advocating and clamoring for them for a long time. Thror's Ring being in this game is huge to me.

I could have bought french version of Fire in the night (also on the shelves here) but since the english version is supposedly no more than a couple of weeks away, I passed.

The ring is absurd. Discard a card to ready an hero AND put in play the discarded card if it is an attachemt????? Crazy. With a minimum of deck scrying this attachemt is both readyng effect and resources acceleration/ smoothing. it allow to play off sphere attachemnet (steward without leadership or citadel plate free and without tactic). One the most powerful effect in the game with minimum of building requirement. 

Gandalf + an hero dwarf would be fun...

For all that says the new guarded card is so poweful I disagree. Guarded is a mechanic with many drawback. You have to deal with another encounter cards, and that is a really big deal to me. They aren't good beginning cards, since it is usually already difficult to dealt with the encounter cards of the setup and the turn 1 while you play only a few ally/equipment. So a global powerful effect (like necklace of girion) seem more powerful to me that a simple untap. But, still to me, none of them are good cards that must be played in many decks.

I think Man the Wall it's still quite good, especially in multiplayer of course. [It could also be interesting in solo if used in combination with effects that let you play allies outside the Planning Phase (like Hirgon or Thranduil) since you will then ignore the drawback that they cannot quest.] Ignore this, I didn't notice it's a Planning Action.

Partially true but not always. Cards like duneadain hunter or pathfinder see play because the extra card is not always so unmanageable. Not a turn 1 card clear but still good and if you can use it as both resource acceleration and readying effect the potential to be strong card at mid game a is there.

They look the same but aren't. You will not have to face their threat, you know how to deal with them (you "choose" enemy or location), have some kind of choice many times, have a direct access to the rewards (do not need to defeat them to get the ally. But the reward is also weaker. But I also think those 2 aren't good cards for decks made to face difficults scenarios.

I am so far more lenient toward the Hunter and Pathfinder than toward the guarded. You can more easily combine them with your strengths as you know whether it is an enemy or location.

## 58 [Halberto on December 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3555098)

True. I don't think guarded cards are universal but they provide a lot of benefits if played well. Combined with scrying you can use them to get rid of nasty treacheries like a pocket Eleanor, discard horrible encounter side quests or avoiding when revealed effect on encounter cards. True you have to deal with an additional cards but if you don't play them blind they can bring a lot of benefits.  Necklace of Girion is basically an additional hero (2 willpower and 1 resources x round) without ability and threat.  

Not cards for alla decks or quests but very useful in the right context.

Yeah in regards to pathfinder and hunter they actually benefit you, as the hunter in a dunedain deck you want enemies engaged and pathfinder helps with haldan decks that need locations to put attachments on.

Yep, "Guarded" is a cost.  But it's a very hard sell to suggest that the cost here is greater than the payoff.  If you're seeing the ring as "a simple untap," I assure you that is not what makes the ring powerful. 

The ring should read "exhaust this ring to play an attachment for free. And if you feel like it, ready the attached hero also, I guess."

You will put this in a deck which knows what card is on top of the deck.  Gandalf, Imladris Stargazer, Gildor.  Or, you will just fill your deck with 75% attachments.

Then, you will get a free attachment nearly every round.  Let's say you get a minimum of 5 within a single game (assuming you are putting this card into a deck which makes sense, which you ARE doing, because you understand deckbuilding).  That's minimum of 5 resources, assuming you're paying for 1-cost attachments, or 10 to 15 resources, if you're paying for 2- and 3-cost attachments.  If you're putting fewer than 5 attachments into play over the course of the game, you didn't build the right deck for this ring.

All that for the cost of 1 location or enemy-- definitely worth it!

And I guess the ring also readies your attached dwarf or something, whatever.

I say "this card is not good because there is only few decks who want to play it". You respond "This card is awesome because few decks want to play it". We think mostly the same about this card, but we just did not express it the same way.

For more details untap or equipment feeding share a common point: to be interesting enough you must use it many turns in a row. Having it on the late game would not be really efficient. To be good (and worth to build part of your deck around it) you must have it early. And at this point the investment to make it work on the early game will be huge. And I think that this card, and the decks that want to play it, aren't made for playing against the most complicate quest. Most people don't care, but I'm looking for card and mechanic able to do that so I'm pointing it.

So this ring works pretty well in a dale deck, what with attachment heavy tricks. What dwarf do you think fits well with that? I figure you go Brand and bard for the dale, leadership and spirit. Any ideas? Maybe this dain?

## 66 [dalestephenson on December 3, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3555289)

Playing against nightmare quests directly affects the cost of Guarded player cards (or Dunedain Hunter/Pathfinder), because the average strength of the cost is likely to be higher, potentially *much* higher.  I don't play nightmare, so the cost is much lower for me while the benefits remain the same.

Dwarven Kings are quite strong contenders for this ring, after all they are the rightful heirs. You could ready Thorin Oakenshield to use both his willpower and attack, or attack twice in a round. You could ready Dáin Ironfoot after defending to buff your allies when they attack (and try to discard Ancestral Armor). Thorin Stonehelm could attack twice for four damage.

Pretty much every other dwarven hero with at least 2 willpower and 2 attack benefits from readying, as well as Thalin because he can quest and attack for 2 afterwards. Gimli and Glóin of course want their free citadel plates. Come to think of it, you could even include cards like Scroll of Isildur in non-mono sphere decks.

I can imagine splashing in a dwarf to an attachment-heavy deck (not necessarily Dale) in order to able to include the ring. Splashable dwarves are Balin, Bifur... not really heroes who are worth readying, for the most part.  But the ready would not really be the reason I'd include the card in a deck.  Leadership Gimli is an interesting idea, as it allows you to put attachments on him that tend to be hard to justify otherwise (Dwarven Shield for example).  Thalin would work, since his ability requires him to quest, which he is not built for. At least you could use his attack.

This seems like a very narrow way to define "good". So Vilya is not a "good" card because it only works in a specific deck type? And Caldara is also not good...

## 70 [player1683311 on December 3, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3555321)

Seastan beat me to it, this is like Vilya for attachments. Where Vilya is powerful because of it's resource acceleration, the same goes for Thror's ring. Both are putting things into play free, both are restrictive for who can wield them, Thrors ring can be seen as a in hindsight card.  If they were to design Vilya now they would probably nerf it in the same way. Having a guarded card limits hiw quickly you can put it in play, as you must deal with the card guarding it. It is amazingly powerful but I would agree with both philosophies, guarded is dangerous, and can be a steep cost, or it can be bent and used as a benefit. 

## 71 [GrandSpleen on December 3, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3555327)

Thror's Ring would work very nicely with Vilya, imagine both of those cards putting attachments and allies into play...

Well, at least we have different reasons for including Thror's Ring. And it does not raise threat like Magic Ring does.

I actually had a deck that wasn't able to beat the nightmare version The Lonely Mountain (one of the tougher nightmare quests) until I put The Arkenstone into my deck.

And what do you think of the other cards?

The lore event seems correct in an Haldan deck. A sort of conditional but potentially much more powerful version of secret path.

The dwarf ally feels quite strange to me. Cost is prohibitive if you play for it, effect good but 3 cards discarded are equal to dain effect for a worse payback. Sphere seems wrong as for the most the dwarf discarding mechanic seem set in spirit and to an extent in tactic.  Yes stand and fight exist to a reason but still. Stat are good for a non unique character no doubt but the cost is so high if you can't cheat it into play.

## 77 [Halberto on December 3, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3555418)

I forgot the new Dale ally. I need to think more of him and try in real life before telling. Cost is fair for the stat. The ability is ok and help compensating the initial cost. If you pay it discounted then he sure is good but not sure he will make into all Dale decks considering the great allies Dale has now.

For me I like to load one location up with attachments, travel to it with south away to reduce my threat, put on elfstone, and be able to draw a pile of cards for more elfstone targets. 

That lore event seems to be a miss for me. It seems like mostly loading up with attachments on one location since you only travel once a round is better than spreading them out. Of course one resource for essentially a boost of 2 willpower isn't a bad deal...

The dwarf is bonkers, essentially free readying to attack and defend with a 3 and 3 ally?  His cost is high.  He and wiglaf are a mighty pair of allies. Hopefully you could cheat them in or play them with steward. The mining mechanic is spread among spirit, leadership, and tactics now though...I'd prefer if this guy was in the former spheres actually.  A thorin dain deck with another hero like the dwarf who gets tactics and spirit icons would be great

I'm hoping it too, but it have to be a card designed only for a mining dwarf deck, in order to make a clear distinction between this archetype and the swarm dwarf archetype, who still have the most powerful cards, and enjoy the actual mining cards like ered luin miner.

I think there will be a problem with a large amount of dale allies if we keep getting more. There aren't a lot different Dale builds, so some allies will sadly just see less play as the more powerful ones take up slots in every deck.

I’m a little afraid of that frankly.  I feel there is going to be a very fine line with mining between under and over powered.  (But then Dale is basically bonkers now already so...)

In my experience this is not as bad as it seems.  The early game is where my threat is low enough to handle one enemy at a time.  And the threat of location lock is far away.  I more often play them on turn 2 or 3, after having improved my game state a little.

As for the deck needing to be designed specifically for the guarded cards; My wife and I currently are using two.  She has Glamdring, and I have the necklace.  We built our decks before they were released, but we both do have multiple Noldor discarding effects.  So if we get guarded cards and the staging area is already too intense, they are not dead cards in our hands.

Once again this is just my personal experience with guarded player cards.  I haven't played any nightmare scenarios with them.

I

It's too early to really tell but I would expect guarded cards to be similar to player side quests.

They simply are not an option against some scenarios but totally fine in most. In both case they are not cards to be  played blind of the board state. 

I would love an hero with a set up effect for guarded cards similar to thurindir for side quest. It would them  feel more strategic... it would feels at home in Dale trait too.

They have a point in common: in some case the side-effects is quite negligible (moment where the scenario take a break). I agree that a hero who benefit to set guarded card will be interesting.

With the exception of wiglaf, who is his own interesting card, I feel like every dale ally we have gotten since the deluxe is overkill, it was massively powerful and these new allies I dont even use really

This new one is debatable. The allies we got in first two AP however were from good to great. Guardian of Esgaroth is among the best Dale allies i think.

Guardian of Esgaroth really likes his Wild Stallion.

@LordBird [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/333840-lordbird/] did you also pick up Fire in the Night? There are still a couple cards in that pack that haven't been spoiled: Quicker than Sight and Outmatched.

I did not buy it but I found someone who did. Don't have pictures but text is (my translation):

Outmatched: Attachment, Tactics, Condition, Trap. Cost 1

Play in your area unattached. If unattached, attach Outmatched to next valid enemy that engages you.

Response: After attached enemy resolves his attack, ready defender.

 

Quicker Than Sight: Event, Spirit, Cost 0

Return to your hand a Sylvan ally you control to cancel a shadow effect just revealed during combat.

The event seems so goooood for Silvan deck.

Outmatched is not bad but not for all (most) traps deck probably. Seems more useful for a tactic deck featuring Beregond and without access to better ready effect. We will see....

Ok we really got a new Bilbo hero with the same cost-stat ratio....

 

And not bad at all too I would say.

Boy you called it, the very next day we get our new Bilbo, and he is good against guarded!

Hey all,

Have there been any more reports on this pack besides a limited Canadian release in French? Any English copies out yet? It's still listed as "in development"... hmm...

Just seeing if anyone else has picked up a copy. And how is the quest!

## 103 [Bullroarer Took on January 4, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3581654)

I don’t have a copy, but there is at least one English copy out there.  (Confirmed by pics.). Not as hard as Fire in the Night is the report, but a good quest.

## 104 [player3351457 on January 13, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3589599)

Just another update...

http://www.fantasyflightgames.es/en_desarrollo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.es/en_desarrollo]

I know it's the spanish print, but its projection for GoF is this month and MG for February. 

Seems to be a little more specific and up to date than the "upcoming" on the english version of this site.

Not sure about familiar lands. Mirkwood hunter,  south away, and Haldan digging with elfstone all incentivise you to pile more attachments on a single location. This event costs one, and it demands lots of locations with attachments. This card is a hard pass for my haldan deck. 

## 107 [Bullroarer Took on January 22, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286390-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3599342)

My goodness. So it might be another 2 months before we get it in hand (6 weeks on boat, 2 weeks to get to distributors and for them to send to me). At least that was the withered heath pattern on my end.

When it's all said and done this cycle will take a year to have everything released. Maybe longer.

And it's a shame, because it's been the best cycle for me in a long while.

NOMEN OMEN

Or the power of Morder, if you prefer. (This effect cannot be cancelled)
