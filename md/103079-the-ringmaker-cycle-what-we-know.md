Please post anything I’ve missed. I’m going to keep bumping this thread and editing this post as we get more information. This thread is only for confirmed spoilers though, and in spite of how well reasoned your guesses might be, I won’t be adding those to the list. (For example, the names of Quests 4 ~ 6 were spoiled on BGG, but the thread was taken down and we don’t have confirmation.)

Rumil, Pursuing the Enemy and Galadhrim Minstrell were spoiled with The Dunland Trap, but the wording of the article indicates they are from the cycle and not necessarily that box. (Also, the numbers appear to all be double digits to me.) That is why they are listed as Others.

*Finally, take the card numbers with a grain of salt. I can’t read them very well on my screen and even FFG doesn’t seem to know sometimes as shown by Celeborn and Naith Guide both being called card 1. If you have a better screen and are really sure what the number is, I’ll add that to the list.

We, or at least part of the community, know the names of the rest of the AP's. They were posted at BGG and removed shortly. I can confirm that they seem to be legit since Trouble in Tharbad was among them (before the announcement obviously).

Isn't it "Pursuing the enemy"?

> Isn't it "Pursuing the enemy"?

****.  So it is.  Will fix it.

 

I saw the BGG thread too, but again, this is only for confirmed spoilers. And while I believe the titles to be correct I'm not going to add them to the thread unless we see them listed at a game store or some such.

> Ok, just making sure you were aware of it. That's why I didn't post the names.

I think a good compromise is for the names to be posted here in the thread, but not in the first post until we have confirmation?  (Go for it.)

## 7 [Gizlivadi on April 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103079-the-ringmaker-cycle-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1037664)

Ok, so here it goes:

 

A while ago someone posted the names on BGG saying they got them from a german online store called milan-spiele.de in which there were listed in preorder.

 

The three remaining ones are named:

 

The Antlered Crown FAN1082
The Nin-in-Eilph FAN1085
Celebrimbor's Secret FAN1086
 
The three trials and Trouble in Tharbad were also spoiled there.
 
So the antlered crown is what they were looking for in the second pack... Nin-in-Eilph is another name for Swanfleet, a marshland near Ost-in-edhil (I looove that location!!) And finally Celebrimor's secret!!! that can only mean something about rings and ring-making. A theory I have posted before is that we're helping Saruman in the making of his ring or something like that, or maybe he just makes the ring at the end of the cycle.

I remember the topic Gizlivadi mentions. I wrote back then that i believe we might get a Galadriel hero in Celebrimbors secret, since she was around back then and might have a clue on the ring making (Celebrimbor made the three Elven rings), but it is a guess. After all the names of the two last pack indicate that the heroes will be leading to Ost In Edhil ... Otherwise known as the capital of Eregion, ruled by Galadriel before Celebrimbor :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

> So when are we getting any news?

I'm starting to get antsy for something new too. It's been almost a month since our last preview of Trouble in Tharbad.

If expect the next thing to either be the 4th AP (obviously) or it would also be about time where we would see a more detailed article about "the road darkens". Most likely about the quests themselves

I usually anticipate saga less than cycles but I am now looking most to see the Road Darkens (let us have a new preview soon, yes?)

As for the next cycle, I have high hopes it will be the best yet, the Silvan cards appeal greatly to me.

I'm excited for the new Saga expansion as well, especially because they're only adding one non-Frodo hero. Not that I'm glad about that, but it sure does make the anticipation level rise!

Is part of the reason we're all gamers because we love the anticipation? I've just about made the full move from a PC gamer who dabbles in tabletop gaming, to a strict tabletop gamer, and I feel way giddy way more often now, waiting for pieces of cardboard, than I did for PC games.

I am not sure, but I think Rúmil is number 56

## 21 [ana4 on April 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103079-the-ringmaker-cycle-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1045823)

So I am ready to speculate. I think Naith Guide and the Tree People represent staple Silvan allies and events we shall see throughout the cycle, just like we had the Records attachments (Book, Map, Scroll and Tome) and the mono-sphere events in the previous one. Thus I believe we will see an Ally of cost 2 in each sphere and an event of cost 0 as well. Further, they will most likely have them two per pack (one for each but there it is getting harder to guess).

 

Also, since the third pack is supposed to feature no less than six Silvan cards, and Rúmil seem to be fitting there with his number, we might, in addition to the "regular" ally and event, see Haldir as a hero, and his brothers Rúmil and Orophin as allies in different spheres. Additionally, there would still have to be one more Silvan card in the box.

 

Finally, this is not much but since the trait boosting attachments were announced (and one spoilt already), I think it is not hard to guess that beside Tactics for Warrior, there will be Leadership for Noble, Lore for Ranger and Spirit for Scout.

Though the article that revealed Captain of Gondor didn't mention the Healer trait, I hope that there is an attachment for them as well. I'd assume it would also be in Lore, if the attachment exists.

Healer support is unlikely - there is only one card with the Healer trait! (Warden of Healing)

True, Skiller healer from black riders gives a hero the healer trait for the rest of the campaign though

Some of the traits are very capricious and probably oversights.  For example Rivendell Minstrel is not a minstrel, but Gleowine is.

## 26 [danpoage on April 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103079-the-ringmaker-cycle-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1046364)

Yes, part of me wants an FAQ which addresses these trait oversights:

Elrond and Daughter of the Nimrodel should have the Healer trait
Dain Ironfoot should be Noble
Legolas should be an Archer
Ally Denethor should be a Steward
Rivendell Minstrel should be a Minstrel

Many others which I cannot recall right now

 

Except Noble, these traits have little effect on the game, so I can see why this would not be a high priority. Still, the theme is so right in so many ways, it makes it more noticeable when there are missing details.

I think Archer was the greatest mistake, I believe it only appears on Horseback Archer? But we have many, but I see no point with the ranged keyword, of course keywords and traits are different things but I find it easy enough to address the ranged.

No, I totally agree with the above, I have actually asked a question to ffg yesterday about Vilya not being an item, though the other artifacts are. And it may play a difference in the future.

It would be great if they could fix it but it will be very hard to do so, because either we have to memorize all that, keep a list beside the board, or ffg release all errata cards -- I would pay handsomely for that.

 

I hope we get extensively into all race/national traits, including Beorning, Dale, etc.

Then at least to the major occupation (if you like): Warrior, Ranger, Scout, Craftsman (that one is not so random), perhaps even Healer and Minstrel.

Then attachments, mounts is surely getting support, then we've got traps, weapons, armour, artifacts, items, conditions, titles... But already they had been some early mistakes like Master of the Forge fishing any attachment, not just weapon or armour, for instance.

Item plays a difference now in the foundations of stone quest stage 3 Washed away requires you to discard Items but not artifacts so Vilya is safe.

"As it begins The Ring-maker cycle, The Dunland Trap also provides more support for the Mount trait, as well as the Time X and Doomed X mechanics featured in The Voice of Isengard, and players will also discover thematic ties to Saruman and the White Council."

So there's a mount in the first AP too then. You may as well chuck it on the bottom of your list. Although, I have no idea what it could be.

Where was Captain of Gondor mentioned? Could someone link me, please.

It's not necessairly a mount. Technically, horse breeder is a mount support, yet not a mount.

Orophin surely. Especially as he seems to be bringing an ally back to your hand from the discard pile. The italics part is a guess only. However, I cannot think of fitting Tactics into a Silvan deck, thus Rúmil will have to join a different (support, perhaps) deck.

True actually. My sylvan deck is tactics and lore.

Rumil would probably fit vetter in my grey company deck. Not necessarily thematically but the deck is low on allies really (I could perhaps take some of the dunadain signal cards out.

I think that Orophin brings your Silvan ally into your hand from play. That's why his cost is only 3 with rougly the same stats of Rumil.

Just trying to get a handle on how much support silvan is getting, and it seems to be alot.

TDT: Celeborn, Naith Guide, Tree People

TTT: at least 1 ally, event, and attachment promised.

T iT: Silvan Hero, and 6 player cards!

TNIN: Island Amid Perils

CS: Galadriel, although not silvan trait is still an obvious support card. Orophin.

So, that's 3 heroes including Galadriel and 13 player cards that support Silvan trait.

Of the 13 player cards 7 have been spoiled. besides the ones mentioned above Rumil, Pursuing the Enemy, and Galadhrim Minstrel will show up in TTT or T iT.

That means we have seen almost a little more than half of what silvan has in store, and we still have one more AP to go.

This is truley impressive. I'm not sure we have seen a trait so thoroughly developed during a cycle than this. Dwarves mostly got their boost from hobbit Saga and Khazad-dum, while it only took outlands 1 AP.

But if you took all 13 Silvan cards that we're sure to get in this cycle that's enough for a 49 card deck. With the possibility of more cards in the cycle and the existing cards already in the pool this should give us plenty of deck building chocies to make.

My hope is that the trait does not have an obvious formula for success, and that with a decent amount of cards that support the trait their will be a number of strategies players can take. Although it seems like the main one wil be allies leaving and entering play through player card effects.

Overall it looks like there is alot more in store for Silvan than what we have seen so far. I can't wait to get these AP's in hand. T iT should epic, 6 player cards! Outlands, in Stewards fear, got Hurluin and 4 player cards, and we all know what that looked like, of course they had the ally buff thing going on. But 6 cards for 1 trait in one AP plus hero Hero, should change the silvain trait overnight.

You keep mentioning heroes as separate from player cards. Don't heroes count as player cards?

Yeah. I was not sure on that.

Most of the ffg articles say say something like this "Trouble in Tharbad introduces a new Silvan hero, along with three copies of each new player card."

Makes it aound like the hero is not included in the player card count, but I'mreally not sure. Either way it still a lot of silvan love.

A few more quotes a bout wether or not hero cards are countered in the player card count.

"The Nîn-in-Eilph introduces a new Ranger hero as well as twenty-seven new player cards (three copies each of nine different cards) that focus on knowledgeable guidance and wise leadership."

"Thus, even as six of the new player cards from Trouble in Tharbad lend further to support the cycle’s Silvan mechanics, another lends strength to the Eagles that last received attention in the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle."

To me it sounds like the hero is not included in the count.

Most AP give us 9 new player cards. For Trouble in Tharbad sounds like 6 silvan, 1 eagle, and 2 unknown.

Anyway, it's going to be a long wait to find out.

Why wasn't the antlered crown spoiled before Trouble in Tharbad, The Nin-in-Eilph and Celebrimbors Secret?
As it was supposedly the Dunlending relic you look for in The Three Trials shouldn't it be set after this quest?
Seems strange for it to be at the end after Celebrimbor's Secret..... perhaps it is on the journey back to Saruman and Isengard that this last quest takes place..?

This is odd. I thought Celebrimbor's Secret would be the last pack... It seems like the place where Saruman's plans for us would find their conclusion.
I think there's been some moving around of the packs since they were leaked. We'll have to see what the last one is called!

Warning: speculation ahead!

 

There are eight heroes in each deluxe expansion and subsequent cycle. For Heirs of Numenor and Against the Shadow, there were two from each sphere (Boromir, Hirluin; Beregond, Theoden; Pippin, Caldara; Mirlonde and Faramir). This wasn't true for Khazad-dûm and Dwarrowdelf, but it was true for Shadows of Mirkwood and Khazad-dûm, which were the first eight heroes after the Core set (Prince Imrahil, Dáin Ironfoot; Brand son of Bain, Boromir; Frodo Baggins, Dwalin; Bilbo Baggins and Bifur). It seems fairly likely that we will have two heroes from each sphere in The Voice of Isengard and the Ring-maker cycle. We've now seen previews for each adventure pack, and we know some information about each hero.

 

Here are some guesses as to the heroes we'll see, together with some reasons for those guesses. What we know is in bold.

 

The Voice of Isengard:

Eomer. Tactics. Rohan. Noble. Warrior.

Grima. Lore. Rohan. Isengard.

 

The Dunland Trap: Celeborn. Leadership. Silvan. Noble.

The Three Trials: Idraen. Spirit. Dúnedain. Ranger.

Trouble in Tharbad: Haldir of Lórien. Lore. Silvan. Scout.

The Nîn-in-Eilph: Halbarad. Leadership. Dúnedain. Ranger.

Celebrimbor's Secret: Galadriel. Spirit. Noldor. Noble.

The Antlered Crown: Gamling. Tactics. Rohan.

 

I'm fairly confident about Idraen. The artist's page [http://jakemurray.deviantart.com/art/Idraen-431989061] describes her as "a hardened female ranger of the Dunedain." It's possible that she's an ally instead of a hero, though we already know that there are three other allies in this pack (Greyflood Wanderer, one Noldor ally and one Silvan ally), together with multiple cards supporting the Silvan trait and Secrecy.

 

Since many Silvan cards are Lore, I expect that we'll get a Lore Silvan hero that (unlike Mirlonde) synergizes with Celeborn and Galadriel. We also know, from a Master of Lore interview with the artist of Silver Lamp [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/artist-spotlight-owen-william-weber/], that a new card for Haldir is coming. This new card is probably a hero, he's likely Lore, and he's thematically a perfect match for Celeborn and Galadriel. I'm guessing on the scout trait, but it matches Rumil's trait and we know that we'll be getting a unique Title attachment for scouts [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4739] (almost certainly Spirit, which would fit in a Celeborn/Galadriel/Haldir deck).

 

The last two heroes are more speculative. The designers have been developing Rohan in Spirit and Tactics. I think it unlikely that we'll get three Spirit heroes in the Ring-maker cycle, and especially not two in immediate succession. I'm guessing that the Rohan hero is Gamling from the quote at the beginning of the preview for The Antlered Crown. He's old, and he commanded the defense of Helm's Deep before Théoden arrived. (There are other possibilities, such as Erkenbrand or maybe even a Tactics version of Eowyn.) The Rohan hero could be Leadership, but is more likely Tactics.

 

The Ranger hero has a good chance of being Leadership, since the Nîn-in-Eilph preview says: "The Nîn-in-Eilph introduces a new Ranger hero as well as twenty-seven new player cards (three copies each of nine different cards) that focus on knowledgeable guidance and wise leadership." If all of my sphere guesses are correct, that would mean two heroes from every sphere. Halbarad is definitely a guess, though there aren't many unused Tolkien characters that would fit the Ranger trait. Dúnedain, Gondor and perhaps Silvan seem the most likely associated traits. Given where the adventure pack is set and the focus on Gondor last cycle, a Dúnedain hero seems more likely than than a Gondor hero. If I'm right that the Ranger hero is Leadership, it seems unlikely that we would get two Leadership Silvan heroes in the same cycle. I doubt we'll see our third version of Aragorn or Faramir here, or another copy of Elladan, Elrohir, Damrod or Anborn. Mablung is a possibility, or perhaps an FFG creation. Assuming Idraen is a hero, I doubt that we would get another Dúnedain FFG creation in the same cycle. It also makes sense to have a Leadership Dúnedain hero aside from Aragorn, since most Dúnedain cards are Leadership.

 

Speculating is fun, and in less than a month, we'll have some new cards!

Best educated guesses I've seen for this game before.
Really hope you are right about Halbarad and Gamling. I really love the Haldir ally and am looking forward to having him and his two brothers in the one deck (two decks really, but one at the same time as I play two handed) so don't know how much I'd actually enjoy a Haldir hero.... pretty sure hes more or less confirmed though..

Haldir and Idraen given, Halbarad and Gamling less likely.

I find it interesting that we have 3 APs AND The Road Darkens expected for Quarter 2... Are they seriously going to try to release 4 sets in less than a month? I suspect all (except Dunland Trap) to be pushed out. MAYBE get another pack later this month, but certainly not 3 more.

Now that the first pack has come out, we have a pretty good idea of the encounter set distribution for this cycle. What we know is in bold, and speculation is not.

 

The Dunland Trap: Dunland Warriors and Weary Travelers.

 

The Three Trials: Ancient Forest.

 

Trouble in Tharbad: Misty Mountain Orcs.

 

The Nîn-in-Eilph: Weary Travelers.

 

Celebrimbor's Secret: Broken Lands (and perhaps Misty Mountain Orcs).

 

The Antlered Crown: Dunland Raiders (and probably Dunland Warriors).

 

The Three Trials, Trouble in Tharbad, and The Nîn-in-Eilph were all spoiled by quest cards in their previews. Since Broken Lands and Dunland Raiders are not accounted for, they'll be used in the last two quests. Their distribution is pretty obvious. Misty Mountain Orcs might not be in Celebrimbor's Secret, since the preview mentioned Mordor Orcs. Dunland Warriors is quite likely in The Antlered Crown, since war has broken out in Dunland.

 

Weary Travelers might also fit either of these quests, especially Celebrimbor's Secret, but it seems unlikely. Encounter decks are tending to be thinner and more consistent, and it's already being used in two quests this cycle. After Shadows of Mirkwood the only encounter set to be used in more than two quests in a cycle was Misty Mountains, which wasn't used at all in Khazad-dûm. None of the other encounter sets seems to fit the last two adventure packs.

 

Encounter set distribution doesn't tell us very much, but it gives us a foretaste of what these quests might be like. The anticipation continues!

It looks like one of the other guardians in The Three Trials will be a Boar Guardian. I'm guessing this based on the fact that the 3 guardians are related to the dunlendings and so far we've seen Raven Clan enemies in The Antlered Crown and Boar Clan enemies in The Dunland Trap and the only Guardian revealed so far is Ravens Guardian.

You were right about Idraen and looks like your going to be right about haldir too! I think it's gonna be Mablung instead of Halbarad though. Considering how similar they are however kinda still counts as correct.

I really like how they are integrating mounts into the Rohan Trait and giving one of the first really strong deck archetypes a new favour. 

 

When the spirit mount first came out I liked the idea but couldn't really see why I would want to use it. Much like Forth Eorlinglas! Love the idea hasn't worked for me in practice... still hopeful.

 

Then we get fantastic new mounts Firefoot & Warhorse and a very helpful Horsebreeder to go fetch them that are very effective.

 

Now it looks like we might have a good reason to include Steed of the Mark...assuming trample damages relates to mounted questing heroes... which might have synergy with charge of the rohirrim as it is for a phase, not the combat phase, perhaps applying its bonus to the trample damage effect somehow... if not your trampling questing heroes can ready themselves and even Eowyn once you add +3 is worth attacking with. 

 

"Spirit:

That "trample" event when you damage someone by questing"

 

I would really like to see a low starting threat Rohan Hero (unlikely with Leadership)... or some type of stunned effect Rohan event where all effected enemies stay in the staging area... for Forth Eorlinglas!

This thread is only for confirmed spoilers though, and in spite of how well reasoned your guesses might be, I won’t be adding those to the list. (For example, the names of Quests 4 ~ 6 were spoiled on BGG, but the thread was taken down and we don’t have confirmation.)

How do we know, that hero from Antlered Crown will be Rohan?

From the preview article:

The Antlered Crown introduces sixty new cards to The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game, including a new Rohan hero, three copies of each new player card, and a new scenario that carries players deep into battle with the wild men of Dunland.

"Discard 1 random card from your hand" means discarding one card at random ?!

How can they, with one single stupid word, destroy the interest of one unique card ... The restriction (attached to galadriel) is so important, and the effect written is so poor, it is almost a disadvantage to use it. I am really disappointed with such poor card creation.

I like the Mirror of Galadriel.  It's not useless - not by a long shot.  It feels balanced to me.  It's probably not a good effect to use every turn, but if you have enough of your army on the table already, and a possibility of losing the game looming, I can see this as a great desperation move.  Also if you build a deck that takes advantage of the discard pile, it could be useful in other ways.

 

The only tweak that I'd make to it is to let the effect target any player.  Then, I think if becomes a good support card especially in desperate situations.

I don't think it's poor card creation at all. It seems carefully considered and achieves three things:

 

1) Balances the powerful ability to pull any card you want out of the top 10. Without any drawback, this would be too good, in my opinion.

2) Makes deck building and strategy more interesting. Now you have to build your Galadriel/mirror deck to compensate for the random discard and will have to carefully consider when to use it and when not to use it. It may be a matter of personal tase, but I find this way more interesting than simple plug it in and exhaust it every turn.

3) Ties directly to the theme of the mirror. The knowledge it provides is not infallible.

Watch the Team Covenant video and Caleb explains it.  You may not like it, but he had a reason.
