I can't think I'm the only one who would like to see sub-forums added for Rules Discussion, Events and Off Topic section (and possibly even a meta-thread) like the other LCGs. This main one could stay as a generalt hread, but it does make it harder when trying to find answers related to rules/card interaction and, if nothing else, I'd like a section dedicated to that.

Anyone else?

Agreed.  It just isn't practical to scroll through over 12 pages of thread titles looking for gems.  If they were sorted into sub-forums, it would work a lot better.

Me, I am surprised they have not been added yet now that the game is released.

I agree that there should be at least a rules subforum, but I've been poking around WI and AGOT forums and it seems they almost have too many. It gets confusing as to where you read that post you liked or where you posted to look for a reply.
