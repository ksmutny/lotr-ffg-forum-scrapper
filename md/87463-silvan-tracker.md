The wording is a bit confusing to me here--does this mean that if you have a silvan tracker in play, *all* silvan characters heal a wound when they ready?  Or is it just one per silvan tracker?  I was thinking the latter, but it seems kind of unclear.  (of course, they heal 2 wounds if Elrond is around, hehe).

## 2 [GrandSpleen on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=826813)

All of them!  Someday if there are more Silvan characters with more than 1 HP, this ally will be great :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  As of now, her ability can only possibly work with a few characters.  Legolas plus Song of Mocking with Silvan Trackers in play is a fun idea that I've tried, but had trouble getting it to work consistently.

No our friend wrong. for one silvan tracker you can use 1 responce one time.

So when your silvan tracker untap you choose 1 silvan charachters and heal him. The best is working with Elrond so silvan tracker heal him self twice which is really cool against DF arshery.

If you have 2 tracer you can heal 2 characters or 1 character twice( with Elrond 4 times).

Is that certain? The text is:

 

Response: After a Silvan character readies during the refresh phase, heal 1 damage from that character.

 

Surely each readying Silvan character can independently and separately activate the Silvan Tracker's response, given that in each case the correct trigger has happened? I understood it this way, but I am often wrong on the intricacies of timing etc in this game. Other thoughts?

## 5 [Morithain on July 30, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=826841)

Well, there's Mirlonde, Haldir, Mirkwood Runners, obviously Silvan Trackers, and Lorien Guide.  All these guys would heal two wounds every turn with one Silvan Tracker in play and Elrond as a hero.  All at no cost in resources or exhausting.  That's pretty awesome. Even if it's only one silvan ally healed, that's pretty good since it's free healing.

I laso though like this but there is a trick. I try to explain. My English is not so good but anyway...

Since all characters untag simultaneity all in 1go. then you can use a response only once since it was one move.

If they do 1 by 1 then yes you can do for all.  But they do all in 1 go. So you can use 1 response per tracker. with 2 tracker yes 2 characters. Same for another card  Song of Erendil where one player can take another player threat on him. But you a take only one threat per 1 copy of Song of Erendil. So if threat is add by 5 you can take 1 threat per copy of Song of Erendil.

Hope i got my points

Wow, if Glaurung is right, that completely alters how I thought the card worked. I thought all Silvan characters would be healed.

Not sure now.

## 8 [Alex6222 on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=827098)

Well i always played it the hard way (just one response) but Glaurung's point seem very legit and i think it´s the way to play it.  By the way does anybody know if Silvan Tracker is a she or a he?

## 9 [Crabble on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=827110)

In Germany this card is called "Spurenleser der Waldelben" so this character should be male.

 

And I would agree with what was replied, one tracker heals one silvan character. If this card would have ment to heal all Silvan characters its card text should have been something like this:

 

"Response: If at least one Silvan characters readies during the refresh phase, heal 1 damage from each Silvan character in play."

It's not the wording on the card that makes it suspect.  Glaurung suggests that all characters ready simultaneously and thus present only one trigger for the card's response.  I don't think it matters whether or not they refresh simultaneously.  Glaurung compares it to threat, and I see his point.  If a card says "Doomed 5" you raise your threat by 5 all at once, not by 1 five times.  

 

Nonetheless, characters are certainly discrete entities.  Even if 3 Silvans ready at the same time during the refresh phase, you still had 3 Silvans that just readied -- 3 discrete events that happened simultaneously.  This falls under "simultaneous effect timing."  Resolve them in the order you wish.

 

The closest parallel I can think of is the questing phase.  All characters controlled by a given player are committed simultaneously on that player's turn.  If you commit 5 characters, though, you still had 5 characters commit as individual characters, not as a vague block.  If Aragorn (Leadership) and Lorien Guide commit to the quest together, this happened simultaneously but you can still trigger both characters' responses.  

 

That's not a perfect comparison because in my example above I've got two cards with responses pertaining to that card exhausting.  With the Silvan Tracker we're talking about one card with a response pertaining to many cards readying.  I don't think it matters, though. If 5 characters are killed by a treachery effect, you can trigger the Horn of Gondor's effect 5 times.  Again not a perfect parallel, since damage is resolved individually.  But that's why I brought up the Questing phase -- committing characters to a quest IS done simultaneously, but you can still trigger separate responses off of that one "en masse" event.

That was a big rambling post, but the point was that in the questing phase we have a block of characters that change state simultaneously, but we still have to recognize that each card exhausts as a discrete event, and can trigger individual responses accordingly.  So whether characters ready simultaneously or not in the refresh phase should be a moot point-- Silvan Tracker can heal them all.

 Very interesting thoughts...but I favour that all can be healed.

 

> Same for another card  Song of Erendil where one player can take another player threat on him. But you a take only one threat per 1 copy of Song of Erendil. So if threat is add by 5 you can take 1 threat per copy of Song of Erendil.

Yes, all characters (of 1 player !!!) are ready at the same time in refresh phase.

But you can´t compare it with "Song of Earendil", cause it´s not the same:

 

Response: After another player raises his threat, raise your threat by 1 to reduce that player's threat by 1.

Response: After a Silvan character readies during the refresh phase, heal 1 damage from that character.

 

If threat raises 3 (by treachery for example) you can only reduce 1...cause it´s only one act.

But refresh all characters are several acts...just at the same time.

 

 

That´s only my opinion...but wouldn´t the card be useless if only 1 silvcan (per player) can be healed?

Then the event card allow you to draw 2 cards when ally go away the leadership one from core set also allow you to draw in 1 go 10 cards if 5 allies die. there is mo logic my friend....... Im just try to think logic....but you never know designers right?

Lets ask them better!

Well, as a player, I would love for all my silvan characters to heal just because I have *one* silvan tracker in play (make that 2 because, well, Elrond).  But as a game balancer, it would seem that healing all silvan characters is kinda broken.  So I'm leaning more on the harder version of one tracker for one (er, two) wounds healed.

You right. It is broken. Actually to be honest all healing effect in this game is boken.

For example combo with Elrond and Godorian healer is crazy powerful. Put this guy on the table and you dont care about damage anymore. Same like Northern tracker for the Core set and SOM cycle. Play tracker and forget about locations problem. I think is wrong when with one card you can solve one big mechanic of the game. By the way NM change it.

No.  Events are one-use and discard.  Silvan Tracker stays on the table after you use her (his?) response.  But you CAN get 10 resources from Horn of Gondor if 10 allies are discarded at the same time.

Please explaine why you can't get 10 resources if 10 allies dies. Most people I have ever meat/played with/talked to play like this as nothing indicate the opposite.

## 20 [Morithain on July 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=827628)

Well Lore decks are my favorite and healing and card draw are the biggest strengths of Lore.  Lore has its weaknesses though, for example its slow on resources, has very little threat mitigation and mediocre at fighting and questing.  Elrond is ridiculously powerful, but he has a very high threat cost.  I like this thematically, though, even though he's so powerful, especially once he gets Vilya (kaboom!).  I mean, after all, it IS Elrond.  The only character more powerful than him would be Galadriel or Gandalf, neither of which are heroes.  

 

Either way, though, even if you get to heal all the silvan characters with one tracker, it's still not super-mega powerful, mainly because there are only so many silvan characters with more than 1 hp out there:  Mirlonde, Legolas, Haldir, Lorien Guide, Mirkwood Runner, Silvan tracker (obviously)...that's about it.  All the other silvan characters only have 1 hp and die if damaged so they can't be healed.  And if you have all that on the field already--you win anyway!  

 

I guess the only way to really see until we get some kind of official ruling on this is to play it both ways and see which way is or is not too weak/powerful.  

## 21 [GrandSpleen on August 1, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=828263)

Well, if Legolas has a Blade of Gondolin, and you defeat an enemy, you can use that single event to trigger both Legolas's response and the Blade's response.  One event may trigger multiple responses.  

 

Likewise two discrete events can trigger the same response two times.  The rule is: one response may be triggered once per trigger.  So if one ally is discarded, you cannot trigger Horn of Gondor's response multiple times for that one trigger.  But if two allies are discarded, you can trigger the Horn's response two times, once per trigger.  I'm surprised Glaurung would question that.

 

At first I thought the only real question here is whether characters being readied during the refresh phase counts as a single event, which could only trigger a given response one time, or whether each character being readied is a discrete event, and each one could trigger a response (like Silvan Tracker).  Now that I see your thinking a little more clearly, Glaurung, it seems more like a fundamental question as to whether several simultaneous events can trigger the same response multiple times.

 

Since the rule for responses is "once per trigger," I don't really have a lot of question in my mind here.  5 characters leaving play is 5 discrete triggers for the Horn, and 5 characters readying during the refresh phase are 5 discrete triggers for the Tracker.  Feel free to shoot that question on to the designers if you're still in doubt.

## 22 [GrandSpleen on August 1, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87463-silvan-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=828266)

And I agree with Morithain, the Silvan Tracker certainly isn't overpowered even if it can heal multiple allies.  Silvans are physically weak in general (and likely will stay that way as a race) and many of them can't benefit from the Tracker's effect at all.

Yes about HOG you absolutly right.....I forget about this one........Sounds like you right then. But then I can reduce a lot of threat with SOE? Hmmm sounds very broken then........ we need ask designers

Yes, you could reduce a lot of threat with SOE, but you'd increase your own threat by that much.  So it's a tradeoff.  You use that when your deck has a lot of threat mitigation but your ally's deck doesn't.

I asked a rule question and here is the answer:

> You can trigger the Silvan Tracker's ability for each Silvan character that readies during the refresh phase. If 8 Silvan character's ready at the same time, you will trigger the Response 8 times and resolve them one by one.

I think it was clear that he heals everyone (otherwise why playing Mirlonde?). I think the point is that his reaction triggers automatically, so it can fire multiple times at one point of the game, unlike reactions that you need to play via event or exhausting a character.

 

Good explanation by GrandSpleen btw!

What do you mean? SoE works only once. If one player raises hir threat by 5, you can still only raise your threat by 1 to lower his threat by 1. You don't do this for every single point (otherwise Elfhelm would be quite the bummer).
