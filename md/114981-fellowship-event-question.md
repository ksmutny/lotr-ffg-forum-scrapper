Ok, so I have done multiple FF events in Netrunner but I have never had the chance to do one for LotR. So I was just curious as to exactly what happens. Does every person that participates get the PoD? Is it a competition? Is it casual? Do I have to play in a group or can I play solo? How much does it cost? etc.

Any clarifying information would be helpful so I know what I am getting into and what I should show up with when I do go.

From what I know :

- each pack is around 20 euros... (yeah, sorry, don't know for USA)

- each pack is 4 times : 1 pod, 1 alternative art aragon, 1 playmat

- pack can only be purchased by shop

 

That's all.

We don't like the official competitive format in France (should I dare say europe ?), and we have people preparing meetup in a shop, all players are assigned to table of 4 and can deckbuild beforehand.

I think that in Europe, if you want a competitive LotR game you can still find enough people to play Decipher's CCG.
