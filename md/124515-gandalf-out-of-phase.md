Hey,

So Gandalf allows you to play a card once per phase.  Does this allow you to play allies and attachments in other phases, like combat or travel? Or is it just events that he could play this way?

Thanks.

It will only be events in the other phases and allies, attachments, etc. in planing phase.

Reason being is that his ability says play as if from hand, so you can't plays allies and attachments form your hand during the other phases besides planing
