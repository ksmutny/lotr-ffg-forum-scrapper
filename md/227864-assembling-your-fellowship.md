I've gotta say, Campfire Tales is such an underrated card in multiplayer, but I see a lot of leadership decks that don't include it.  I feel like it's some sort of altruism test.  Every mono lore deck includes Mithrandir's Advice because it's 1 resource for 3 cards, which is amazing.  Campfire Tales in 3-4 player is as good or better than Mithrandir's Advice (1 resource for 3 or 4 cards), yet it's so much harder to include in your deck because you are only getting 1 of those cards.  It's an interesting social experiment.

I think a lot of players build around solo and two-handed, when Campfire Tales is least useful.

I use Campfire Tales in two-handed decks, as I tend to be light in card draw effects.

Right, I don't expect decks on RingsDB to include it.  But I've attended many meetups where you know that we will have 3-4 players per table, yet I almost never see Campfire Tales hit the table.  There are certain adjustments you should make for playing multiplayer, and Campfire Tales may be #1 on that list for me.

This card is a leadership auto include in our playgroup, usually 3 players.

What do you guys think about Keen As Lances?  Would you ever include it without other Victory Display support?  At 4 players it's almost worth it.

Even the first two uses are expensive for what it does, so it would be difficult to get the ball rolling.

I am a big fan of this recent trend of getting guest writers to do articles. First we had Ian and now Sean, all three very well written and highly enjoyable to read. It's really nice to see an article that's written purely from the perspective of a fan - and it's great that people who have done a lot for the community around this game are being recognised.

 

The art choices are spot on as well, especially the Blood of Númenor one. I wish Magali would hurry up and sell a print of that.

Can't wait until they ask me to write a guest article.

Completely agree. I checked a few months back and about 17% of the decks on RingsDB with two Lore heroes still included Mithrandir's Advice-- in the sphere with the most draw choices in the game-- so even in two-player Campfire Tales should be playable, especially since Leadership tends to be long on resources and short on cards.

 

One way to make the altruism a little bit easier to swallow is to get the other decks to agree to toss in 3x Campfire Tales, too. It may not be as fun to run Campfire Tales when you're the only one, but when there are 12 of them floating out there in the fellowship, things get a lot more fun in a hurry.

 

Ally Elrond is the same way. He doesn't get any love compared to Core Gandalf, but that "everyone draws one" effect is even more powerful in 4-player. Get some Leadership/Lore decks running Campfire Tales *AND* Sneak Attack / Elrond and watch the fellowship really take off.
