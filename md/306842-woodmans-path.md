What is the correct effect of woodman's path ? On my french version it's written "reduce quest point value BY 1", but on ringsdb it is "reduce TO 1", and it make a huge difference.

What's written on ringsdb is the correct version. Very powerful card.

Thanks.

And if you play woodman's path and elf stone on the same location, does it have 1 or 2 quest point ?

Just 1.

It is analogous to what RR Modifiers [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule553] says about an effect that "sets" a value:
