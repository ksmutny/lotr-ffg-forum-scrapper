Can I use Snowborn Scout to place a progress token on the Quest card? Similarly, does Northern Tracker place a progress token on the Quest card when he commits to a quest?

Thanks!

Galen

No, quest cards are considered their own type of card. Just like allies are different from heroes, quest cards are different from locations.  So, unfortunately, Snowborn Scout and Northern Tracker cannot put progress tokens on the quest card.

Note that:

- Northern Tracker can only put progress tokens on locations in the stagging area.

 

- Snowborn Scout can put progress tokens on any location, whether that location is the active or is in the stagging area.

 

 

But neither them can, as stated above, put progress on quest.

 

Only Legolas, Blade of Gondolin and Longbeard Elder can place progress on quest.
