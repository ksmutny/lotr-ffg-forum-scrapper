Hey there,

recently I've created a fan made mission based upon that double sided location / island setting. This is a fresh idea to the LotR LCF style of play, but I think there are only two missions, that uses this kind of island setting. I wanted to expand on that.

I also did a first beta testing. So far, I have printed them on my home printer, cut them and sleeved the cards. The cards are somewhat shuffle-able but in the end, there could be more.. Does anyone here know a good way to (professional) print them? (I do live in Germany)

As I am not a native speaker, maybe someone is willing to spell check my wordings? That would be very nice and also a possibility to play that mission on your own! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Here is a preview of some cards:

As you might have figured, this leads to a game of "Memory" (where you have to find pairs of cards, which are face down on the table) in LotR-style. There are only 6 pairs, but as you are distracted by other things like nasty undead it is quite hard to remember all the places. This is the back side of all double sided locations:

An example of a "pair" card:

And some cards from the encounter deck:

Oh, and did I mention that the tiles move while playng? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Images on the cards build the atmosphere of the game, but I am not a painter. So I took all the images from the www, different sources. I hope no one does mind.

Cheers,

Flrrb.

Hello,

To get cards with a effect the most clear possible I think that you need to use the grammar of the game. To do it simply think about cards who work similar to the one you want to create and make a copy/paste.

I can't help you for your english since I'm French and have similar trouble

Here:

Its stats may sound weak (for the endboss), but because of secundary effects of the locations in the victory display, he has +2/+2/+2.
