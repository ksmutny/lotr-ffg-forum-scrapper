I'm playing the Hills of Emyn Muil quest. Traveling to the North Stair location, I reveal Rockslide, an event that deals 2 damage to each character commited to this quest. Since this happens during the Travel phase, are my questing characters dealt 2 damage or not?

 

Thanks!

Free pass!  Nobody is committed to the quest, so Rockslide will whiff.

I love when nasty effects that only affect the quest phase appear during travel, combat etc

so good
