Finally got my nightmare decks through the post today. Only played mirkwood so far, and beat it easily multiple times. I hope the others are more challenging.

Looking at my copy of Dol Guldur's nightmare pack, I have three copies of Brown Water Rats, two of which are fine, and one of which is misprinted:

is anyone else's like this?

Edit: Oops, It was Anduin, not Dol Guldur.

Anyone know why you can only buy Dol Guldur and Passage as nightmare from FFG shop? Didn't they have Anduin also?

 

EDIT: Apologise if I'm hijacking your thread, just didnt thought it was that important to make a new ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

i bought all 3 from their shop, granted that was like the day it was announced they were avaliable.  maybe they're already out of anduin

I also ordered all three the day they were announced, so they were all available at some point. I'd be surprised of they're out of anduin, as its...print on demand. Surely they print them when people order them...?

## 7 [CaffeineAddict on August 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88490-nightmare-deck-misprint/?do=findComment&comment=840064)

can't find it on the main shop link, but on the LOTR site they're still there:

Exactly! Sounds strange??

 

But the encounter set logo on the one you just showed us...isn't that the Anduin? Not part of the Dol Guldur? Maybe that's why it's taken out of sale for the moment?

Oops, yes you're right, it was Anduin not Dol Guldur. Hmm, that might explain it, then.

Dang it! I just ordered the Dol Guldur in hope to get one of the miss prints before they would do anything about it!! Now I have to cancel it  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Oh well, I should have posted the question BEFORE ordering hehe. Luckey you guys that got one before they pulled it.

i had played maybe 2 matches before i realized it; and then i only realized it because it was revealed as a shadow card and i was like "yes no shadow effect!!!!!!.......wait a second here.....darn"

Just bought the nightmare decks at GenCon. After reading this thread I had to go check my Journey Along the Anduin. All three copies of Brown Water Rats are the same, so misprint problem must be fixed.

I have the same thing, two are fine but one isn't. Card 8, if that's of any interest. 

 

Also, has anyone else noticed the cards feel almost plastic-y? When I first opened the packs they felt almost like Gloom cards...

I just ordered a copy from Miniaturemarket. Don't know if it includes the misprint or not but since I like to collect as much as play I hope so :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] else, if anyone doesn't care and wanna part with theirs I'd be happy to trade ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I also got a pack with the misprinted Rats. However now that I think about it, I believe I had another card that was misprinted as well. I'll check when I get home.

Sounds like a cool game! I really wonna try Anduin with 4 players. This one of the best quests in the game and Amazing in NM.
