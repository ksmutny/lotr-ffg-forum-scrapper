# [Tournament Rules - not official, based on rulebook only](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43912-tournament-rules-not-official-based-on-rulebook-only/)

Here is my proposal about tournament rules:


1. Every team (1 to 4 players) should prepare Player deck’s and one Encounter deck corresponding to given Quest.
2. Teams are paired and in given Quest Team 1 will fight against Encounter deck of Team 2 and vice versa.
3. During the first Round of Team 1, Team 2 act as referee. After that Team 2 starts his first round with Team 1 as referee and so on.
4. Match last till one team finish his Quest or both teams finished their Quests.
5. After that, team which scores better result is a winner and moves to next phase.
6. Depend how many teams participate, there can be different Quest in each phase of tournament.

 

Of course before tournament should be known what Quests will be used and how to build Encounter deck (how many cards and what types).

Any comments and suggestions?

Only promblem i have is the referee think and rounds.If a normal game lasts 30-60 min as FFG says then with this system a tournament game will need over 1:30 hours an this is bad for a tournament.

My proposal is one team must have 3 players and the two teams must play at the same time.Two of the 3 players play against the encouter deck and the third person acts like a referee.At the next round the person who did the referee must play with his deck and someone else from his team must be the referee.

I dont think team-based referes are a good way to go. Will force rules shitting to get advantage.
