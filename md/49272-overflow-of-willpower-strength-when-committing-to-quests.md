 Hello all, I was just wondering if this question has been answered before. Lets say that after some time in a particular quests, a location has been traveled too and it only requires 3 progress points to be completed. Lets say all players and enemies points balance out to having something like +5 willpower strength, finishing off the active location and leaving a +2. Does this extra 2 points get added to the current quest or is it lost in time and space?

It gets added to the quest.

Willpower overflow from location to quest, but not from quest to quest.

 Thank you, that's what I thought after a few times playing quests repeatedly.
