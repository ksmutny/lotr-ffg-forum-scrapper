i  just played a game wher a treachery card actually worked in my favour

i had an exhausted gandalf, and was defending an attack (not with gandalf) - pursued by shadow came up as a shadow card, which then allowed me to return gandalf to my hand instead of discarding him, first time this has happened, wasnt sure if there was a catch but cant see any

that is interesting.. havn't seen this myself.. but seams a valid move.. there are no "enter play tapped" cards yet are there?
