## 1 [Nyarlazorbec on June 1, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=478268)

Hello,

To complement the actual online resources and give you offline deck building capabilities, I propose you my new Deck Builder software for The Lord of the Ring LCG game.

It is available here: eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/index_en.htm [http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/index_en.htm]

Some of you already know and appreciate the Call of Cthulhu LCG version of the Deck Builder (see here : www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=35&efcid=4&efidt=31993].

This one has a whole new themed user interface, along with the necessary adaptations to the new game. But it keeps the portability and extensive features of its predecessor.

As for my previous Deck Builder programs, it is a FREEWARE and runs on any Windows 9X/2K/XP system (or Linux/Mac OS using Windows Emulator programs).

The minimum requirements are :
- About 3 MB of free disk space (without pictures)
- A graphic resolution of 1024x600 pixels in thousands of colors (higher resolution is strongly recommended).

The software does not require any additionnal DLL, runtime or database and does not install anything into the system folders or registry.

It is fully translated in both English and French. You can independently select the displayed language for:

- The main user interface
- The built-in semi-graphic card display and cards lists
- The use of external picture libraries in one of the two languages.

It contains a complete database of the published cards in english and french, including FAQ corrections, flavor texts and illustrator names.
It displays cards in a compact manner to keep the software as light as possible.
This is the best spoiler list you may have at your fingertips.

There are extensive filtering capabilities for player and encounter cards lists, custom sorting, full statistics, scratchpad for deck preparations and more.

You can add cards to your deck with just one click and adjust quantities very quickly.

The deck list can be loaded, saved, exported (text-delimited, spoiler and html formats).

More features will be added to the software in the next weeks and months.

THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY FANTASY FLIGHT PUBLISHING INC., so ask me directly for any support, suggestions or bug reports.

Happy deckbuilding

(Nyarla)Zorbec

To complement the above description, here are some informations about the current version of the software.

Current version is Beta 0.7.0.

It is already stable and upward compatibility of deck files will be maintained in next versions.

Some features are not implemented yet in this beta version, but they will be in the next weeks and months, including:

- Deck printing
- Deck checking
- More single card, deck or cards lists export formats (spoilers, etc...)
- etc...

Also, I didn't had time yet to upload complete pictures packages for the software. This may come later.

Here are a few screenshots taken on the previous beta versions (click on the miniatures):

Thank you for your kind offer. My immediate plans are to finish the implementation of all functions first.

Translations to other languages could require a major redesign of several things, but I may consider it as a future evolution. If you want to discuss it more, please contact me by email (see the readme.txt file).

Cheers !

Nyarla comes through again.  You rock bud. 

As for getting the card pictures, I happen to know from experience that if you have a scanner you can help him out a lot in this regard.  (unfortunately mine is busted)

Hello,

Thank you for all the positive comments.

The new Beta version 0.8.0 is now available !

The first and greatest improvement is the availibility of images packs in both english and french.

Unlike the previous versions, there is not need anymore for a complex folder structure containing individual pictures. If you want to remove the few ones which were installed by previous beta releases, uninstall the old version before installing the new one.

Important note: The image packs are not included into the main setup program. Please, refer to the download page of the website for instructions to get and install these image packs.

The second new functionality is the deck printing, optionaly including notes and main statistics.

You can click on the following picture to have a preview of the deck printing options and screen:

th_screenshot14_optionsprinting.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/th_screenshot14_optionsprinting.jpg] [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot14_optionsprinting.jpg]th_screenshot13_deckprinting.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/th_screenshot13_deckprinting.jpg] [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot13_deckprinting.jpg]

Finally, I performed a complete proofreading of all english and french cards.

The remaining features, still in the works, are:

 * Deck checking.
 * Last deck files list and deck files searching features.
 * Cards and lists export in spoiler format.
 * Card drawing tool.
 * etc...

The download link can be found in the very first post of this thread, or into my signature.

Have fun happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] !

Cheers !

These image packs are features introduced with version 0.8.0. So yes, you should install the latest version of the Deck Builder first gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Hello,

A quick fix version 0.8.6 is now available.

It corrects two bugs, the first one being particularly nasty:

 * Correction of saving bug when at least one hero is empty.
 * Correction of total card count display of the player's cards screen while the statistics page is active.

Cheers !

Hello,

Is there anyone who can make scans of The Hunt for Gollum cards in english and send them to me for a quick update of the DeckBuilder ?

I will buy the french pack next week, but my english pack will take much more time to come...

Any help is welcome. Please answer by email at (replace # by @) : zorbec.lotr#free.fr

Cheers,

Zorbec

Hello,

A new version of the LOTR LCG DeckBuilder for Windows is now available.

This version 0.9.0 is probably the last Beta, most of the features being implemented and stabilized.

Here are the news:

 * Added cards of The Hunt for Gollum adventure pack.
 * Added first published cards of next adventures packs.
 * Added errata from FAQ 1.1.
 * Added the deck finder/import tool.
 * Added uniqueness filter to encounter cards.
 * Correction of progress screens aspect.
 * Several corrections applied to filters.

I am still waiting for my The Hunt for Gollum adventure pack in english to arrive home.
That's why the english image pack is not complete yet. If you can provide some scans of the english packs, do not hesitate to send me an email. Any help is welcome !


I will now give you some details about the new deck Finder/Import tool.
This screen permits to search your decks depending on their contents, then open one found deck or copy part of it into the current deck.
 

To open this screen, click on the history & finder button as shown below:


screenshot16_historyfinder.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot16_historyfinder.jpg]

 

Then, click on the Find a Deck... option, as shown below:

screenshot17_deckfinder.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot17_deckfinder.jpg]

 

The Deck Finder screen opens, as shown below:

screenshot18_deckfinder.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot18_deckfinder.jpg]
 

 * First, you should select the base folder where you store your deck files. To do this, click on the button on the left of the "Search from" path display.
 * Next, you can define up to 4 search criteria which can be a hero card, a deck card, a word or sentence in the deck's notes or any text in the information fields of the deck.
 * Then, press the "Search" button to find the corresponding decks. If no criteria are selected, all decks will be checked and listed.
 * The "Results" button only appears after a first search run with at least one deck found to bring you back to the previously found decks.
   If you exit the Deck Finder and come back to it, it will keep the results of the previous search (but not if you exit from the DeckBuilder itself).

The Results display is shown below:

screenshot19_deckfinder.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot19_deckfinder.jpg]
 

 * The list on the left shows the found decks. Select one to display its contents on the right part of the screen.
 * The list on the right shows all informations, heroes, deck cards, scratchpad cards and notes of the deck. If you select a line with a card, the card is displayed the usual ways, like other screens.
 * You can stop the search by clicking a button not shown here.
 * The "Open deck" button will try to open the selected deck into the DeckBuilder and close the Deck Finder. If a modified deck is already open, the software will ask you what to do.
 * If you want to take only part of the selected deck, you can use the copy buttons for general informations, notes and complete heroes or deck cards contents. The positions/quantities buttons are also available for heroes/deck cards to make a partial import of data.

Be carefull with the partial import features : it does not ask anything if you had a modified deck already open.

I hope you'll find the DeckBuilder useful. Do not hesitate to drop a comment or suggestion.

Have fun !

Zorbec

 This is great! Thanks very much!

 

Any chance of getting the ability to sort/filter by set? For instance, I don't have Osgiliath, so i do not want to see cards from that expansion.

You have that in the Filters and Sort pages of the encounter screen. The point is that the filters setting is not persistent between two DeckBuilder sessions, but sort orders are. Tell me if you need some help.

I have just started trying to figure it out, and I didn't see an encounter screen (or at least did not recognize it). How would I find the place to select which sets are included?

Yeah, I was thinking about this as well; Is there a way to tell the tool what you actually OWN in your own collection? To sort of filter and set the bar for how many cards you can add etc. ?

Hi,

From the main screen, click on the button showing an encounter card back (the first on the left). If correctly activated, it should be surrounded by a yellow line. This will bring the Encounter cards screen up (if not, it means that the screen is probably moved outside your screen limits for some reason. In this case, you can reset all screens positions by pressing the Ctrl+Alt+L keys).

In the Encounter cards screen, click on the "Filters" top bar button to display the filters. The first filters page is for encounter sets. If you selected a speficic quest or scenario in the "Scenario/quests" screen, you can filter the sets used for the scenario by clicking on the "Scenario" blue button located above the sets list.

If you want to sort the list, click on the "Card sorting" top bar button to display the sorting page. There, you can combine up to 4 sort criteria in any order (ascending or descending).

Hope this helps ! (if not, ask again !)

Cheers,

Zorbec

 Yeah, I was thinking about this as well; Is there a way to tell the tool what you actually OWN in your own collection? To sort of filter and set the bar for how many cards you can add etc. ?

Hi,

Unfortunately, I didn't put collection management (yet !). The "Qty" indication refers to the quantity of cards into a single original set (core set or adventure pack). So, I assumed that most people would remember easily how many cards they own depending on the sets they own. It is not a feature as critical as with CCG games.

Adding this collection management is quite heavy and it's not on the top of the priorities. Yet, I will note this for a future implementation.

Cheers,

Zorbec

 Ah! I was trying to do it in the Player Cards window!

Thanks very much. I appreciate the help, as well as the time and effort you put into creating this utility. May the hair on your toes never fall out!

 Is there a way to add categories to the display? When i right-click on a title bar I can change the category to a different one, but can I insert one? For example, if I want to show both quantity and victory points, can i do so without removing an existing category?

Also, is it possible to resize the columns? Often when I filter a category all the entries have short names, and I would like to eliminate the wasted space while viewing the display.

Thanks again for this great utility!

Thank you for the kind words happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] !

Unfortunately, the number of columns for cards lists is fixed and they are not resizable (their size is optimized to show the longest data of the whole card database). This was done to simplify the development and the user interface. As it requires much work to make something completely flexible, I'll put it in the list, but not in the highest priority gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Wow, this tool is really, really useful. Great job doing this!


I have a couple of suggestions if you are interested. The first one is easily done I think, but the other one may turn out to be more complicated (but I think the usfullness of it will be worth the effort). They both have been briefly mentioned in this thread but I think it is good to get in plain text.


1. When you filter the available cards it would be neat if you could filter different adventure packs/core set.

2. A feature where you can state how many core sets and adventure packs you have got in your collection and keep track so that you cannot choose too many cards. The qty should reflect this as well.

In addition it would be very neat if this could be combined so that you can group several of your decks so that they share the same card pool (very handy if you plan of creating decks for a 2, 3 or 4 player game out of your collection). When you choose a card the available qty should decrease for all the decks in that card deck group.

 

Thanks for this excellent tool!

Hello,

Thank you for the kind words and for the suggestions.

Your first request (set filter for player cards) will come in a near future. I waited for more packs to be available before implementing it. Encounter cards already have a similar filter by encounter set, which is more appropriate.

Regarding your second request, I was planning a collection management for a much later implementation. But your description of it is much simpler than my previous idea of it. So, I may consider this for a much quicker release gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Last point would be clearly difficult to do, as the program is designed to work with one deck at a time. I'll see...

Cheers,

Zorbec

Hello, fellow Middle-earth travellers !

A new version of the LOTR LCG DeckBuilder for Windows is now available, with some good new features.

Here is a summary of the new things:

 * Added cards of Journey to Rhosgobel adventure pack (english & french).
 * Added first published cards of next adventures packs and extension.
 * Added Conflict at the Carrock scenario text in english.
 * Added extension and adventure packs filter to the player cards screen filters.
 * Added starting hand drawing probabilities in the deck's statistics page.
 * Added detailed drawing probabilities into the Card Drawing Simulator.
 * Added file name and file age deck search critera to the Deck Finder screen.
 * Added deck contents quantity indicators (green background) to the player cards, scratchpad and deck finder screens, not only for heroes.
 * Correction of player cards, scratchpad and deck lists to improve their refresh during contents modifications.
 * Correction of unexpected deck modification if one opens a deck by a double-click above a quantity button in player cards, scratchpad of deck lists.
 * Correction of minor bugs.

Note 1: the Journey to Rhosgobel scenario text is not available yet, the rest is Ok.

Note 2: the hypergeometric distribution algorithm for probabilities gives weird results when the deck contains a few cards, the searched and drawn cards are more than 1. Consequently, the probabilities will not be show in such cases. If one has a good algorithm to deal with these extreme cases, I would be interested.

I will now give you screenshots to illustrate the main new features.

The new filter by sets for the player cards (it also shows the green background indicators for all cards, showing the current quantity put into the deck):

screenshot21_playersetsfilter.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot21_playersetsfilter.jpg]

 

The starting hand drawind probabilities in the deck statistics page. You can click on the "See more" text to show the card drawing simulator with the full probabilities page active (see below):

 

screenshot22_deckstatsproba.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot22_deckstatsproba.jpg]


The complete drawing probabilities into the card drawing simulator. These are calculated each time you draw cards (see note 2 above):

screenshot23_drawsimulatorproba.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot23_drawsimulatorproba.jpg]

Finally, the new deck search criteria:

 

screenshot24_deckfinderfilecriteria.jpg [http://i368.photobucket.com/albums/oo122/Frealaf_album/LOTRLCGDB/screenshot24_deckfinderfilecriteria.jpg]

Probabilities where suggested by Shep, double-click bug and some spelling error was reported by Henning and generalized deck quantities were suggested by Manuel. Thanks to them for their support !

Many thanks to Drew of www.cardgamedb.com for the english scans of Journey to Rhosgobel.

Comments and suggestions are welcome !

Have fun !

Adding new languages, for the textual parts of the DeckBuilder, would be too much work for the time I can spend for this development.

Yet, as the pictures are stored into single files, I may consider to have more languages available on the picture display only.

If you want to help in this way, please contact me on my email (it appears in the support page of the site, readme file or About box of the software). I will tell you what I need.

Thanks.

Just donwloaded and tried the new version. Pleasure to see your program updated, as always. To set the quantities not on a per-card-basis but on a per-expansion/core set/adventure pack-basis is a good idea.

@booored : The web site links are correct (I always check them after updating the web site).

But some web browsers do not detect the update of a new page if you already visited it.

If you don't see the new version when it is announced, just press F5 to force your web browser to load the new page gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

As stated earlier, there is no chance to have a Mac version for the moment. I don't have the hardware and software for this.

It is programmed with an old version of Delphi. The last version of Delphi supports MacOS in some way, but it's still young and I don't own it (neither a Mac itself, which is required).

Yet, you can run it with Crossover or any other Windows emulator, some other people did that successfully.

Thank you for the compliment.

I am working on the KD update now. I should receive my pack later this week and I hope to get the french version before the week-end.

There are many cards to add, scan, check and re-check (and not much spare time for it), so it will take me a little more time to finish. I will probably release the new version next week.

Hm. How complex is the source code or how huge is the project, respectively? I can try to rewrite in ObjC for MacOS only, if you have any interest in such a cooperation. I can use Java as well, making it multi-platform-operational... 

This, however, depends on the size of the project and how many hours of my spare time I can use for it...

Thank you for the proposition, but it would be a really big job to convert the source code in ObjC or Java.

The project is a little less than 70000 lines of code and uses graphical and reporting components that will not be necessarily available in other languages. So, I don't think it's worth the effort for the moment.

this is the best ever!! wish the coc one was using the same interface.. but still .. all sorts of awesome.

1 suggestion though.... .. . It would be cool to be able to remove a card from the deck form IN the deck list.. Like you can click 1,2,3 to add the card, but would be cool if you could remove the card as well from that same screen. Not a big UI issue.. but would be a nice feature..

Also, are there any plans to include the encounter cards? I know "deck building" doesn't come into it.. though I think it would be cool for custom quests.. but then the app will cover the entire game from start to finish, and we would not have to use internet sources to look up cards and stuff.

There's a little separate window that says "LOTR LCG Deck Builder by Zorbec" on the top left, and it has a card image for an encounter card, a quest card, a player card, and other icons.  You need to click on the encounter card in that window, and that will (or should) bring up all of the encounter cards.

Hi,

I've replied to such request already. Sorry, but the answer is no : I don't have to hardware and software for this.

Yet, It's been reported that the DB works on Mac using Crossover…

Hello,

Thank you for your kind comment.

I will add Foundations of Stone as soon as I get the English scans and the French pack.

I've got a very busy week now, so probably not before next week, though.

Hello,

Sorry for the long delay !

I was delayed by some technical issues with some new features I had to postpone for the moment, then I went to vacations lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

A new version of the DeckBuilder is available.

A warm thank you to The_Big_Show for his generous contribution cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

It adds the last published adventure pack in both languages, the new FAQ errata and, unfortunately a reduction of images sizes, as explained below.

The list of new things:

 * Added cards of the Foundations of Stone adventure pack (english & french).
 * Added errata from FAQ 1.3
 * Reduction of card images size to follow FFG/Edge rules of fair use for their copyrighted material.

The reduction of card image size is similar to what is done on well-known online card databases. Sorry for that, but we have to follow the rules…

Many thanks to Drew of www.cardgamedb.com for the english scans of the last pack.

Hello,

A NEW VERSION OF THE DECKBUILDER IS AVAILABLE !

Sorry, again, for the long delay. This was due to the very big update on the Call of Cthulhu version and FFG released many things in a very short time, so it is hard to follow…

This version does not include the first saga expansion "The Hobbit" yet. I still have a lot of work to include it.
That said, this version includes the other last packs and quite a few new, improved and corrected features. So I invite you to carefully read the following notes.

But first, I'd like to give a warm thank you to Orcmeal for his generous contribution happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

The list of new things:

 * Added cards of the Shadow and Flame adventure pack (english & french).
 * Added cards of The Battle of Lake-town scenario (english only).
 * Added a zoom function on the card picture screen. You can use the zoom buttons located in the screen title bar or click once in the picture and use the mouse wheel to zoom or unzoom the picture. The zoom level is kept when you exit the DeckBuilder. Beware : zooming the picture slows down the picture display and the navigation in cards lists.
 * Added deck card management using the keyboard into the following lists: player cards, deck cards, scratchpad.
   Select one of the above lists and press one of the following keys:
   0 (zero) -> Remove the card from the deck
   1, 2, 3 -> Add the card to the deck, with the selected quantity (or at the selected position for heroes)
   S -> Add the card to the scratchpad (does not work within the scratchpad itself)
   Note : to remove a card from the scratchpad, you still have to use the mouse.
 * Additions and corrections to the extensions filters of player and encounter cards lists:
   - The filters' states are saved between two sessions of the DeckBuilder.
   - They are not changed by the global filter reset operation anymore, and they are the placed first in the filters pages.
    -The original grid is replaced by a treeview to enhance selection of sets by full cycle.
 * Corrected the screens position restoration on multiple-screens configuration.
 * Corrected missing and incorrect columns in the player cards and deck lists.
 * Corrected the statistics boundaries for player and deck cards and the corresponding distribution graphs. The values with zero quantities are automatically removed from distribution graphs.

Many thanks to Drew of www.cardgamedb.com for the english scans of the last pack.

Next version will include the first "The Hobbit" saga extension and corrected statistics for encounter cards.

Comments, suggestions (and kudos) are welcome !

Have fun !

Hello,

A NEW VERSION OF THE DECKBUILDER IS AVAILABLE !

Sorry, again, for the long delay. My job didn't let me have much spare time available for the last weeks…

But first, and once again, I'd like to give a warm thank you to The_Big_Show for his generous contribution happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

The list of new things:

 * Added cards of the The Hobbit : Over Hill and Under Hill saga expansion (english & french).
 * Correction of screens and filters for the new sphere (Baggins) and new card type (Treasure).
 * Update of the player and deck card lists statistics.
 * Updated the capabilities filters list.
 * Added both Hobbit Period sample deck lists.

Important Note : Bilbo Baggins and treasure cards from The Hobbit : Over Hill and Under Hill saga expansion are listed, but cannot be added to the deck list because of the special rules applicable to them.

Many thanks to Drew of www.cardgamedb.com for the english scans of the last pack.

Well, I do, too complice [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/guinyo.gif] !

My actual status is this :

- Battle of Lake Town in french is ready

- I will receive my french Heirs of Numenor box next days and be able to put the cards into the DB shortly after.

- Unfortunately, I still don't have the card scans for the english set. So, I will hardly be able able to release an update until I manage to get these.

I'm looking for decent card scans of the Heirs of Numenor expansion. Any help is most welcome !

Any chance that you also add a third language like German. The cards scan are all availble on the net, so that would be an awesome help.

Thanks.

It would be easy to replace the .dat files of the french cards, for example, by their german version. But adding the card texts and stuff in german would be a much bigger task I can't handle at the moment.

Could you send me a email with links for these ? (using the email present in the Readme.txt file of the DeckBuilder).

Cheers,

Zorbec

Hello,

I could probably help you, if only I had a better idea of your problem atontado [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/atontado.gif] It's not as if it was a common one…

What is your system ?

What happens exactly ?

Did it happen from the very first use ? Or after installing another software ?

On which screen ?

Hello,

A NEW VERSION OF THE DECKBUILDER IS AVAILABLE !

The list of new things:

 

 * Added cards of The Blood of Gondor adventure pack (english only).
 * Added cards of The Black Riders saga expansion (english, player cards only).
 * Added cards of Encounter at Amon Dîn adventure pack (in french).
 * Added an option in the statistics page of the deck screen to take unique cards into account only once, whatever their quantity in the deck.
 * Added the Hobbit themed deck list from The Black Riders rules.
 * Updated the filters.

 

The english image pack is updated and complete, except for the latest encounter cards.

 

As it is becoming more and more difficult for me to find some spare time to make the updates, it is probable that the next version of the DeckBuilder will include only player cards and deck building features, which are the main purpose of the application.

 

If I have the time, I may then release a separate application for the scenario and encounter cards reference. Yet, depending on the developments of the CardGameDB site (particularly if it includes a multi-language card database in the future), I may cancel this option.

I'm a big fan of your deckbuilder, it's better than the cardgamedb deckbuilder. But when I try to run it on my MacBook with Wine it crashes when I try to filter the cardlist. Limits my deckbuilding on the road :-)

Shame FFG doesn't develop a deckbuilder for iOS and Android.

that's unfortunate to hear as i really like to use this feature of your application, but i can understand the time commitment involved and wanting to ensure the timeliness of your releases.

Thanks again.. this is awesome as always.

 

I was wondering.. you haven't updated the encounter sets to Black Riders yet... a mate of mine told me you plan to remove this feature from the deck builder.

 

I would just like to say.. Don't Do This!

 

One of the very best features of the deck builder is to be able to sort and look though the encounter sets in great detail using the filters. Like if you have a event you are considering and it triggers of a trait.. exactly how many cards have that trait in the set, or entire game.. it is really cool and the deck builder will be less with out it. It is one of the most key features for making "one deck to rule them all" builds as well as just for checking things quickly like "what is the average defece on the mob" or health or w/e

 

Seriously the deck builder is awesome,, but the encounter set features are one of the major reasons it IS awesome.

It sounds to me it's simply a matter of priorities for Zorbec.  I'm not under the impression there's a crew at work making these updates, and by leaving out the encounter decks it means we get more timely updates for this application's core purpose - deck building, it's a concession that makes sense to me.

Zorbec,

 

I really like the print function so I can save hard copies of my lists, especially when I go to friends' houses and don't have access to my computer.

 

That said, I'd love to be able to "print" my deck list as a PDF, instead of to paper.  Is that a function that is difficult to implement?

Just thought I'd throw it out there.

 

Thanks again for all your hard work on this.  I think I spend more time with your application than actually playing the game hahaha

If you are using PC, try this... "Bullzip PDF or CUTEpdf Printer Free" it is just a virtual printer driver where it prints anything directly to a PDF.. I use it for tons of stuff. There are many others as well. If you use mac there are probably similar things.

## 115 [Nyarlazorbec on March 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47699-lotr-lcg-deck-builder-for-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1011438)

Thanks for answering, Tragic :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Indeed, CutePDF or PDFCreator pseudo-printer drivers are probably the best solution.

 

Today, I can't provide a direct export to PDF from the software itself. Sorry.

 

Cheers,

 

Nyarla

That's ok, thanks for the reply!

I am still somewhat new at this, only have done the core quests and the shadows of mirkwood cycle. I also would only consider myself a casual player but I am not too terrible. I read on the forum that you could check your deck statistics with this program, so I thought I would give it a shot to see what it was like. I checked it out and thought it was pretty sweet, I really liked the part where I could check my decks cost ratios between my spheres. The best part was that... perhaps it was coincidence but the first quest I played after making a deck using this program I scored my very first double digits.

 

Whether it was random or not I plan on using this again to make more decks, thanks for your time and effort to make this program Nyarla!

Hello,

 

More and more people seem to have problems with the card images display. Once copied into the folder where the DeckBuilder is installed, the card images do not show in the application.

 

In most cases, this comes from the default behaviour of Windows 7 or 8 UAC, which protects the default "C:\Program Files" folder (and its derivative on 64bit version of the system) used for program installation. The UAC prevents the installed program to see files copied manually after the installation.

 

There are two solutions to this situation:

 

1) Adjust the UAC to low level or disabled state. This reduces your system's security. So, if you are not sure, don't do that and apply the next solution ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

2) Resintall the DeckBuilder into a folder not protected by the UAC:

 * Make a backup copy of your deck files and .dat files which are into the current DeckBuilder folder.
 * Then, uninstall the DeckBuilder
 * Download the last version of the DeckBuilder
 * Install and, if necessary, change the destination folder for installation to something like "C:\DeckBuilders" or "C:\Card Games". Do not use "C:\Windows" or "C:\Program Files" or "C:\Program Files(x86)".
 * Copy back your deck and .dat files into the new folder, after the installation is complete.

The version 1.1.13 and above of the DeckBuilder setup program will propose a folder like that, but it works only if you make a new installation. An update of a previous version will not move the program to another location.

Though, I found that the proposed folder, by default, for the installation is not very convenient, generating a supplementary level of folder depth. So, please adjust it to a single folder level or wait for the next version...

 

Cheers,

 

Zorbec

I installed in C:\CardGames on Windows 7.  Does not work.   In addition, the Image Pack builder does not work either.

Hummmm....you may have another situation then...

 

Could you be more specific about what "does not work" and how, please ?

 

Any error message ?

Did you copy the .dat files where the DeckBuilder.exe application is installed ?

Have the .dat files the correct size compared to the size given on the download page ?

 

Let me know.

 

Zorbec

Yes.  The program runs fine... but the images do not load/show at all.

 

The only error message I get is when I try to run the Image Pack Builder (not sure if that's needed at all)

Hi J,

 

I suggest that you contact me by email (you'll find my email address in the readme.txt file).

 

Please, send me a screen capture showing your DeckBuilder started, so that I can see more clearly how you set the screens up.

Also, it would be interesting if you could do a screen capture of the Windows' Explorer opened on the installation folder of the DeckBuilder, showing the files present into this folder with full details (file sizes and dates at least).

 

The ImagePackBuilder is only usefull to build your own packs. It is no use if you downloaded the packs. Though, it could be interesting that you give me this error you got on it. This may be a clue.

Maybe you should check again the .dat files sizes compared to what is listed on my website. A misuse of the ImagePackBuilder may have overwrite them with empty files.

 

Cheers,

 

Zorbec
