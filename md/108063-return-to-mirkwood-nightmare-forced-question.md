# [Return to Mirkwood Nightmare Forced Question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/)

## 1 [kyrie on June 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/?do=findComment&comment=1110663)

The Nightmare instruction for Return to Mirkwood reads:

 

Forced: At the beginning of the quest phase, the player who is guarding Gollum must either exhaust a hero he controls or resolve the "when revealed" effect of the topmost Tantrum card in the encounter discard pile. 

 

According to the latest FAQ, when a card reads "must either" the player can choose between either of the forced effects, though he must completely fulfill the effect (the key word here is "either" in contrast with the ruling above it in the FAQ).

 

My question is: If there are no Tantrum cards in the discard pile, can I still choose the second effect and therefore avoid exhausting a hero and resolving a Tantrum card? That is the way I have been playing it. Otherwise, exhausting a hero is really nasty at the beginning of the quest and makes this nightmare even more "nighmare-ish". Just wanted to follow the ruling on this one, since the FAQ addresses it.

I played this one that you had to fully resolve one of the two options, so you would have to pick one you're able to do. I wasn't entirely sure whether or not you could do what you're suggesting either, I just sort of assumed the correct ruling is usually the one that makes it harder on the player, lol.

Looking at the FAQ (1.44), you have to do one in full, so if you can't reveal a tantrum card you have to exhaust a hero. Harder for the player, as usual. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Sure? Look at this card....

 

M1408.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/M1408.png]

 

 

When Revealed: The first player (choose 1): deals 1 damage to all allies in play and Followed by http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?Trait=Night.Night gains surge, or all enemies engaged with players make an immediate attack, if able.

 

 

And when players see this card in setup are glad, because they can chose 2nd option without problems.

But that's not a tantrum card?

I mean that this card has 2 options, and you can try one of them even if not has effect

I think that card works because once you choose the second option, you're still carrying it out, just that there is 0 enemies to attack you. The "must either" wording on the card means you have to carry it out to the fullest effect, and it doesn't seem like you're fulfilling it unless you're revealing a tantrum card. I could be wrong though, it's a very tricky ruling. 

## 8 [kyrie on June 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/?do=findComment&comment=1112382)

@ Chris51261: This is why I am so confused. For the Followed by Night treachery, yes you are still carrying out the effect, even though no enemies attack. But in the same way, you can choose the Tantrum effect even if there are no Tantrum cards. The "must either" means you get to choose, but the one you do choose, you must do everything it says (or at least try to).

 

If this was not the case, then they would inverse the wording on it: Forced: At the beginning of the quest phase, the player who is guarding Gollum must resolve the "when revealed" effect of the topmost Tantrum card in the encounter discard pile or exhaust a hero he controls.

 

But it uses the key "must either" which entails a choice.

 

What if you were not able to exhaust a hero at the beginning of the quest phase because you did something else with them already, and there were no Tantrum cards in the discard pile? This would create an "unresolvable" effect by the way you are taking it to be. The player cannot do either of the effects, and therefore cannot resolve the card.

 

Therefore, I think the spirit of the FAQ and the card in question (Return to Mirkwood Nightmare) is that the player must choose one option, whether or not it actually does anything.

That's a good point, I hadn't even thought of that. I'm still a little confused, and now I'm very curious as to the exact rules on making a choice like this are. I suppose there are other cards that you can pick and choose so that they have no effect, just that the wording on this one is new and says you have to "fully fulfill" an option. Maybe I'll shoot a question to FFG, see if they can shed some light on it.

if the card has multiple options to choose from, you can choose either option.. even if that option fizzles and can not resolve.

Wrong, you can only choose either if either is doable. If one of the two options is not doable you must do the other.

I re-read the rules on the issue with "must either," and it sounds like what PsychoRocka is saying is correct. If one of the options is possible to fulfill in full, you have to choose that one. Meaning that if you hadn't exhausted all your heroes, you would have to do that if no tantrum cards were in the discard pile, and if you had exhausted all of them, any tantrum cards in the discard pile would have to resolve their "when revealed effects." I'm still not positive when the card says to "choose one," you might actually be able to pick options that will do nothing. I sent a question in already asking, will let everyone know when they message back.

Not true, you might wana read the rule book again. There is nothing to say you have to choose the one that doesn't fail. Look at the example Mneda posted

He is correct, there is nothing saying you can not choose which one you like even if it fizzles.

Look at this post however...

Followed By Night must be an exception then.... (or was created when this game was young and was worded badly) as in almost all other cases I've seen rulings in both the FAQ/Rules and people that have asked Caleb come back with: that one option must be fully resolved and able to occur or you must choose the other.

Read this thread. Both cards use Must and Or (nightmare setup card for return to mirkwood and blood of gondor quest card) thereford OBVIOUSLY both act the same.

Followed by Night is clearly a special exception as it states that the first player may choose (and does not specify that if one fizzles/has no effect it cannot be chosen). I had not read this clearly but now that I have see the clear difference. This example is clearly a unique one as almost all over cards that present a "choice" almost always have MUST and OR as part of their text though so with this card you are correct however 9 times out of 10 encounter cards with a "choice" have MUST and OR as part of their text so this seems an exception to the rule.
 

Nightmare setup for Return to Mirkwood however most definitely does state MUST and OR therefore if there are no tantrum treacheries in the discard pile you MUST exhaust a hero.

> I mean that this card has 2 options, and you can try one of them even if not has effect

It has very clearly different text and rules to the nightmare setup card for return to mirkwood.

I think you're right, the "must either" and "must or" are direct results from people being able to take cards where you make a choice and have them do nothing. Having to choose an effect that fully triggers if possible gives those treacheries or whatever card it may be a little more bite. So we can still see what FFG says when they get back to me, but I think that cards like Followed by Night you can choose an effect that may effectively have no impact, as it is an older card. At least that's the way I'm reading it. We shall see. =)

Yup much more thematic as well. You must guard gollum with a hero every turn or face one of his nasty tantrums!

Plus imagine for 3 or 4 turns that no tantrums did show up and there were still none in the discard pile... that would mean for the first 3 or 4 turns you would not have to exhaust a hero OR resolve a tantrum... far too easy for nightmare.

Stricken-Dumb.jpg [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/The-Black-Riders/Stricken-Dumb.jpg]

 

When Revealed: You must either shuffle the top card of the burden deck into the encounter deck and reveal an additional encounter card, or raise each player's threat by 3 and immediately end the quest phase (do not resolve the quest).

 

'Must either' if i remember... the player who has revealed this card can chose 1 of the options.

## 21 [Mndela on June 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/?do=findComment&comment=1113890)

This card also need a choice and it doesnt write 'must either':

 

M1884.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/Cards/M1884.png]

 

When Revealed: Each player must return the location he controls with the highest threat.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/threat.png] to the staging area, or raise his threat by the total threat.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/threat.png] of all locations he controls.

 

If you must do the first options and can't, it is useless to have to resolve the second option. Isn't? ^^

 

 

But it is not the op question.

 

I think yes, if you can't resolve the choice you chose, you must resolve the another. The next cards are examples:

Argh, just lost a big post. Rats.

 

I think I'm retreading old ground, but the FAQ is explicit.

 

"(1.44) “Must X or Y” vs “must either X or Y”
If a card instructs a player to perform one task or perform a second task using the structure “... must X or Y...” then the player must attempt to perform the first task, and performs the second task instead only if the first task cannot be performed.
If a card instead uses the structure “... must either X or Y...” then the player may choose which task to perform, although one of them must be performed in full, if able."
 
So Counter-Attack is missing the word 'either' to give it its intended effect (Mndela is right that the card has a problem as it is currently worded), and Followed by Night doesn't use this form of wording at all, so it shouldn't be used as an example of it. Either way, the FAQ is clear that the Return to Mirkwood set-up text wants you to completely fulfill one of the two options, hence the use of '...must either X or Y'.

> the player may choose which task to perform, although one of them must be performed in full, if able.

You know I always played it like Booored and Mndela but this little faq snip-it seams pretty clear. You may choose, but if one fails and the other doesn't you have to choose the one that doesn't fail.

Am I reading that right?

Yep correct, you can choose between the options but you must choose an option that can actually take effect. If both options could resolve (you have hero's to exhaust AND there are tantrums in the discard pile) you could choose between them but if there are no tantrums you MUST exhaust a hero.

Yeah, to sum up this thread (barring a completely different ruling from FFG when I hear back), if the card says "must" anywhere in it, you cannot pick an option that does nothing. There are treacheries that have you "choose," such as Followed by Night, and it is my understanding that you can pick an option that will effectively do nothing. These seem to be older cards and in an effort to make this happen less FFG reworded new treacheries to include "must." Could be wrong though, lol.

## 26 [Chris51261 on June 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108063-return-to-mirkwood-nightmare-forced-question/?do=findComment&comment=1115712)

Official answer. Followed by Night is a special exception, as are cards targeting "all" of something. In that case, "all" could be 0. Otherwise, you have to choose an effect that you can resolve if possible. 

 

When resolving any When Revealed effect that gives you a choice between two effects, you must choose an effect that you can fully resolve. Followed by Night is an odd example because you can always resolve either effect. That’s because it targets either ‘all allies’ or ‘all enemies’ and the word ‘all’ can include 0.
Good question. Please don’t hesitate to write again if you have more.
Cheers,
Caleb

You are too funny.

 

Also your the one who made it nasty first and said I needed to go and re read the rulebook and then complained about people asking questions on the forums and not just blindly trusting answers from you. Don't try to act too cool now, you were rude, insulting and then completely wrong. I wouldn't have even said anything at all had you not had a whinge about your advice not being followed and your "wasted breath".

Helping those new to the game is not a waste of breath even if they have to ask the developers in the end.

Quit being a jerk booored. You came in here and started talking about "fizzling." And you absolutely were wasting your breath, as it's impossible to listen to anything you say as far as rulings go because you believe you're 100% right all the time but never actually back any of it up with any substantial evidence. And this only furthers that, since you weren't even close to correct.

"So not only can you to not understand the basic rules of the game,"

Worst grammar ever, no wonder no one understands you. I haven't seen any other users on here post as often as you and be completely wrong rules wise so often by the way. Not even new players, and they are at least new to the game, you are not and have been on here a lot longer than I have so you have no excuse.

Clearly it is you who does not understand the basic rules or any sort of social etiquette either and should learn to have respect for other players, who are without a doubt hands down better players than you, don't make me laugh, with the amount of incorrect rulings and ideas you have on here I doubt you have legitimately beaten many quests at all. Constantly people are having to tell you that cards do not work the way you think they do.

 

I actually feel bad for how caught up in your own ignorance and denial you seem to be, not much hope for us? man we're fine, maybe look at yourself and how much of a **** you are to everyone on here, especially people who play two handed and how badly you understand the rules, constantly making wrong assumptions and rulings and insisting to others (worst of all those who are new to the game) that they are in fact correct. Not gonna bother replying again as you are 100% just going to make some other short nonsense asinine post trying to show that you are somehow superior to us regardless of how rude and wrong you seem to perpetually be.

Well...

This thread got an official response that enlight us on another shrouded rule, and will make us better understand the mechanics of this game.

And I start to re read only Booored post on this thread, and he come up completly right.

It appears to me that you are only bashing him because he may appear lofty, but you two answering him in complete nonsense (since, you know, he IS right, the answer he gave totally match with Caleb answer ON THIS POINT) and you are as disrespectfull as you say he is.

Then, Booored being right on this point appear to be only a fluke as he is right only when the wording include "all", wich can "fizzle" but we now know that if there is a future case that doesn't include "all", he might not have been right. Booored give short and correct answer to question ask by begginer (at least, as far as I remember). We can agree he lake in explanation when it comes to debating rules and bragging about unescessary official answer is too much. But see how you treat him too. If I am to say who is giving bad vibes to this forum, I would not separate Chris51261 and PsychoRocka from Booored.

Sorry, it was a long post, I was trying to get it short, but it seems it was too short in my explanation.

So you know that his post was about the Nightmare instruction for Return to Mirkwood and not Followed by Night. Well, as I am not him, and based on the fact he was saying he was right, I assumed he was talking about the other. That's why I capitalize 2 things on my post, the other was "ON THIS POINT" that, in my head, was a shortcut to this post I'm writting now. Since it's not the OP, it surely might be too confusing and should have spent more time to be this accurate. Well, it's done now. If you find any other point that might be still unclear, please fill free to point it out.

Many of the problem comes from that, we do not have enough time to explain ourself throughfully, but when we are reading other, we do not consider that enough and jump to conclusion.

it amazes me pebbels can still not see what is going on here. It is kind of unbelievable.

This is exactly what Caleb said. Should I have taken more time to spoon feed it to everyone.. I guess so. I just expected more I guess. Next time I'll make very detailed posts so even fools can work it out.

This is obviously some bizarro post where saying the opposite of the ruling means you're totally right, so I'm out. Sorry to "disrespect" booored, who is always so considerate of others.

this thread is making my head hurt - haha. total bizarro world!

 

you cannot choose an effect that fizzles if the card says "must," according to Caleb. it's as plain as day. you must choose something that affects the game state (i.e. is able to "fully resolve").

Thank you Dain

OMG... you boys must be trolling.. no one can be this wrong without doing it on purpose. 

 

The point is that these card fizzle. The "all" keyword triggers even on zero cards. It is like a blanket effects that targets all and not individual cards. So the card effect triggers but it fizzles.. that is what fizzles means in card game terms in case you missed the last 30 years of gaming.. fizzles does not mean .. "does / can not resolve".. it means " it resolves but has no effect".

 

When resolving any When Revealed effect that gives you a choice between two effects, you must choose an effect that you can fully resolve. Followed by Night is an odd example because you can always resolve either effect. That’s because it targets either ‘all allies’ or ‘all enemies’ and the word ‘all’ can include 0.Good question. Please don’t hesitate to write again if you have more.

 

Cheers,

Caleb
 

So.. this is exactly what I said.. if the effects fizzles.. then you can pick either, as both ALWAYS RESOLVE. Regardless of if there is an effect during that resolution.

I just finished reading this post and just want to sum it up for my own understanding, as well as that of other new players, since it seems like it could be confusing.
 
Original Post:
 

> The Nightmare instruction for Return to Mirkwood reads:
>  
> Forced: At the beginning of the quest phase, the player who is guarding Gollum must either exhaust a hero he controls or resolve the "when revealed" effect of the topmost Tantrum card in the encounter discard pile.
>  
> According to the latest FAQ, when a card reads "must either" the player can choose between either of the forced effects, though he must completely fulfill the effect (the key word here is "either" in contrast with the ruling above it in the FAQ).
>  
> My question is: If there are no Tantrum cards in the discard pile, can I still choose the second effect and therefore avoid exhausting a hero and resolving a Tantrum card? That is the way I have been playing it. Otherwise, exhausting a hero is really nasty at the beginning of the quest and makes this nightmare even more "nighmare-ish". Just wanted to follow the ruling on this one, since the FAQ addresses it.

So the answer to his/her question is no, you cannot choose the second option because there are no tantrum cards in the discard pile, therefore you cannot resolve the "when revealed" effect on the top tantrum card of the discard pile. It could happen that neither effect could resolve, if there is no ready hero and no tantrum card in the discard pile, in which case the effect would do nothing. If both could resolve (i.e. there is a ready hero and a tantrum card in the discard) then the players can choose, because of the wording "must either". If it said "must ... or ..." you are not able to choose and must execute the first option unless it cannot be resolved, in which case you would resolve the second option.
 
The other card in question is only different because of the wording in the execution of the options since "all" can be zero.
 
This does bring up a question though. What if the wording was "each ally" and there are no allies, can you choose that option, or "each ready hero" and there are no ready heroes?

Yep your summation is spot on.
A really good modern example of this is the following location card:
Altar-of-Midwinter.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Dread-Realm/Altar-of-Midwinter.jpg]
 
It is worded "MUST EITHER" so you have a choice (as opposed to if it simpy said MUST X OR Y without "either") but you have to resolve one of the effects fully so if you do not have a player deck left you cannot reanimate the top card of it and must instead reveal an encounter card. You will always be able to reveal an encounter card however as this effect occurs during the staging step which is part of the quest phase and the encounter deck is always replenished if it runs out during the quest phase. If the card read the first player must reanimate the top card of his deck or reveal an encounter card then you would always reanimate the top card of your deck and would only instead reveal an encounter card if you are not able to reanimate the top card of your deck because you do not have a deck left.

Hmmmm your new question is a tough one. I don't think each can count as zero quite like all can...

http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1171544/mustor-and-quest-1b [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1171544/mustor-and-quest-1b]
The text on "The Ambush" Quest Card for Blood of Gondor received errata so that the language was corrected and players can actually choose between the two effects as intended. You must still fully resolve one of the effects however and it doesn't seem right to be able to resolve the first effect and turn "each" hidden card faceup if you do not have any.... and should therefore have to take a hidden card instead.
So I imagine in another situation if a card gave you a choice between dealing damage to each ally in play you could not choose this if there were no allies in play.
 

This is purely a guess however!

Also jeez this is an old post.. I am quite embarrassed to read the nastiness I took part in... very glad there are pretty much never threads like this one anymore :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

This quest, in nightmare mode and 100 % solo, is one if the hardest quest of the game.
