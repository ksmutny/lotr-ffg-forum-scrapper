Looking at the spoilt preview cards for Blood of Gondor and the Morgul Vale it looks like we are getting two cards with the ability to play an event from your discard for leadership and lore.

Text on the Tome seems to read :

"Attach to a leadership hero. Reduce the cost of playing Tome of Atanator by 1 for each hero you control with the leadership icon.

Exhaust Tome of Atatnator to play any leadership event in your discard pile as if it were in your hand. Then place that event on the bottom of your deck".

Looks like the lore version does exactly the same thing for lore.

These look like pretty powerful cards right ? Can already see some combos with lore's card draw events.

i assume we shall get similar for spirit and tactics. …at first i thought you had to pay the cost but i have just seen you dont have to…so yeah, they are powerful, more so than i thought. i can think of many cards which would benefit from these….how about grim resolve?

they do seem great cards- and interesting mechanics

Good point - grim resolve would be epic !

I think this is too powerful. Probably you can do it once and then discard tome. If you just can cycle your events from discard pile this is crazy powerful

It says discard, not exhaust. Otherwise, very useful cards, but not that much outside the mono-sphere dekcs, it seems.

You cannot call it less useful cose since is not discarded is a broken card which is completely brake all balance of the game…..

In the middle of the game this card effect is same like: next round you win the game.

Still, being an attachment the Master of the Forge could fetch it back - so it may be playable still.

Master of the Forge doesn't pull attachments from your discard pile - just search the top 5 cards of your deck for an attachment.

Do you mean Ererbor Hammersmith?

Either way, the problem with that is, these are mono-sphere cards, meaning you are unlikely to have the Hammersmith (or the Master of the Forge) unless you are mono-Lore, or splashing with Songs.

Yeah, I pointed these cards out a while ago, they look like they're going to be extremely useful. So excited for more cards in this cycle!!!

So did we determine if it's exhausted to perform the action… or discarded?

Either way, if I'm reading the text correctly, it's still an action that has a cost….

 

(Exhaust/Discard) …"to play any leadership event in your discard pile as if it were in your hand". 

 

To me that means that you still need to pay the resource cost of whatever card you retrieve.  You have to pay for cards from your hand, and the retrieved event is played as a card from the hand.  Anyone have a different take on this?  So if you're pulling more expensive events back, it's not something you'd trigger every turn anyways.  But I think that discarding might still be more appropriate… unless the initial cost to play a Tome/Scroll is prohibitively high to satart with to make it worth keeping as a re-usable attachment.
