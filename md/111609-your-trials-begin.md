I like how those guardians are supernatural entities and not just some outfitted dunlendlings.

I'm most hyped about Rumil, because in my group, I play monotactics "kill-anything-as-soon-as-it-pops-up" ranged deck. Strong ranged character with a neat ability designed perfectly for my deck.

Yeah that is 4 damage placed on an enemy right out of the gate if heroes are Bard, Brand and Legolas. Then you have vassals, horseback archers and trollshaw scouts. The bosses in this game could go down just by playing Rumil! lol

Well, I'm running Thalin, Legolas and Bard the Bowman. I value 1 permadamage on most incoming enemies (and instakills of some nasty ones) too much to give it up for third archer.

Telemnar was a Gondorian king that was laid low by a plague (along with his whole family). Thus, the Telemnar's Bane villain takes on the look of a plague doctor.

The art on the sword is actually really awesome as well, plus it looks exactly like the encounter set symbol!
 

Man this quest looks really really good and most of the few reports I've found so far are saying its one of the best quests to date... bit the bullet and ordered it (and nightmare over hill and under hill) off FFG even with the very expensive postage fees and cannot wait to get my hands on it! Finally no more stupid dunlending savages for a while!

## 23 [PsychoRocka on July 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1169241)

Just found a funny mistake as well, "For example, the Raven’s Guardian [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-ringmaker/cards/ravens-guardian.png] (The Three Trials, 42) may have the lowest Attack Strength, Defense Strength, and Hit Points of the three Guardians, but it also has the highest Threat."

Raven's Guardian has 5 defense compared to Boar Guardian with 4 and Wolf Guardian who has 3 making it the Guardian with the most defense.... he does however still have the lowest overall if you combine health + defense.

## 24 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1169312)

I don't think any of this is a mistake. All of them have abilities. 

 

P.S.: Laughed my ass off from this "embarassment" because something fantasy looked alike.

 

P.P.S.: Stewards Fear is my fav quest to date, so I'm having extremely high hopes for this one.

Man, just when my excitement was waning a little, Three Trials has totally geared it up again! I think what I like most is actually feeling like I'm thinking about how to run new deck types for the first time in ages, especially a secret silvan deck.

 

It's also good to see a new hero for spirit who breaks the run of sub-10 threat heroes in that sphere. Nicely rounded stats and an ability that can be built around that offers new uses for loads of old cards: good work FFG! And more secrecy allies (which, in my view, was always what was lacking from secrecy)!

Interesting. How does this deck work? What heroes do you use?

I like booored's idea too... sounds fun. Thalin for sure, then a bunch of direct damage events.  Lore could work too, get some use out of Infighting and Expecting Mischief, maybe a Ranger Bow or two.  Thalin, Pippin, Merry sounds good but starts at 21.  Would need to draw an early Gandalf or else drop a hero...

Also, hurray for Tactics allies with willpower (Rumil).  I am counting the days until I can populate an entire deck with 1+ willpower tactics allies, go monotactics and rule the field of battle as well as the quest.

Totally agree. But I don't think we're there yet.

Finally got the time to play TTT. A very good test, but I managed a win with my superhero attachment deck after a first game loss. In the winning game I opened with Stone Barrow and Raven's Guardian and then had a string of shadow cards that caused additional attacks (plus threat gain). I triggered Strider's ability on turn 2! I really didn't think I was going to win it, but some timely Council from Elrond and a chance meeting or two with the Galadhrim kept me afloat.

## 39 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1171158)

Well, I can't wait to try out Elrond+Silvan Tracker+Elven Mail+Burning Brand combo. 

Two Elven Trackers with 1 def, 5 hp and, ignoring all shadows and regenerating 4 hp each turn would be pretty hard to kill.

## 40 [Bullroarer Took on July 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1171227)

The quest allows the player to choose the order of the trials. The first time you play it you might just grab them randomly because you don't really know what you are going to have to do. The second time you play it you can definitely choose the order that is best suited for your deck. It was a cake walk for me after I cracked the code.

I recommend choosing the trials randomly as well.

I don't have it yet, but is it really as easy as you say, or do you think you cracked the code for the particular deck your using and that different decks will have different codes to crack?

I think that there is a particular sequence that will favor most decks.

And I'm not sure I would say it's easy. I'm playing my best deck after all.

I prefer the first trial: the intuition one

...after: the perseverance

...and finally: the strength trial

 

- The strength trial force you to kill one guardian. You might be ready at the end, but not at first round.

- Perseverance is good if you pass it in a one round, when you are ready playing rounds in the intuition trial.

- The intuition trial is a time thing, so it is ok to be the first trial to resolve.

## 46 [booored on July 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1171376)

the trials is just a more complex version of the trolls in Carrock. There is a order dictated by your decks for battling them as well,.

I agree. Playing Intuition first and then slow rolling can set you up for an easy strength trial. From now on I'm going to randomly pick.

I looked at the cards online on Beorn's card searchamabob and there are some sweet cards for the decks I'm using at the moment (Elven Mail :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png], Warden of Arnor  :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] ).

After looking Warden of Arnor is a lot less use than I thought (although the idea of a Lore Aragorn, Idraen, Spirit Glorfindel deck interests me).

## 50 [Tracker1 on July 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1172403)

So far secrecy strategy for solo decks seems quite useless on The Three Trials and Dunland Trap. Many secrecy decks need a few rounds to get up and running, and both of these scenarios especially TTT, hit hard right away.

So, why the secrecy love if it seems to provide no apparent relevance to the scenarios we are encountering? Not that the cards in the AP have to directly related to the scenario being played, but I do like to try new cards out while playing the new scenario. i'm just not seeing the secrecy connection.

The scenarios are pointing towards aggressive strategies that can pack a punch right away.

## 51 [booored on July 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1172439)

I'm talking about secrecy decks in general, not this particular quest.

Also a mulligan into "Timely Aid" can be pretty fast turn 1 drop. Drop a 2 drop and a high cost ally. That is pretty fast.

Still, the point is many people like secrecy and its problem is that the few tools it have are not really worth the investment.. but cards like that broach are changing that.

## 52 [Bullroarer Took on July 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1172556)

Reflecting on the state of the game at this time I have a hard time seeing a competitive Secrecy deck for solo. I want it t exist, but I just don't see it handling the more competitive quests where there are usually multiple enemies at the start.

Or, in the case of TTT, a barrage at the end. (And, as always, I don't like chump blockers.)

## 53 [Narsil0420 on July 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1172657)

I agree with Tracker that they're not secrecy friendly and that's a shame but It's always been that way so I've resigned myself to it. I will just go back and try the scenarios that are great for secrecy: Road to Rivendell, Flies and Spiders, others?... (I'm going to start a thread about this...)

 

But yeah, I'm with you Tracker, I always want to use as many of the player cards as I can in a new pack! (Leads to a lot of losses!)

## 54 [silverthorn on July 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1177656)

It's just a small thing but I like the idea of having a little short story about Idraen. If that's going to be a thing when original Heroes are released it'll be nice.

## 55 [Tracker1 on July 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1178343)

Something unusual about this quest is the lack of surge. There is only one card (2 copies) that has surge, and that is after you have all three keys.

After playing this scenario a bunch, I went back to play an older scenario and i never recognized how much surge has an impact on the game. It can totally remove any type of advantage you have or make matters far worse then before. Yeah that's obvious, but it really stood out to me after playing TTT

I wonder why the lack of surge in this scenario?

Maybe they're trying to make the game difficult by means other than slapping a players face with 10 surging cards out of the encounter deck in one turn?

Maybe, the scenario is by no means easy.

It's a refreshing change in my opinion.

I think I'll be getting the scenario tomorrow, but if they've managed to make an interesting and challenging scenario without resorting to surge (which can become a bit of a crutch for design I think) then I'm interested to see how it works. Endless surges get rather tiresome - I know why they did it, but slapping surge on nearly every treachery card started to get a bit old.

Writing a preview article takes little to no manpower, you just spill some card images and write a little about them. 

 

My bet is they're not going to spoil anything until gencon just because all spoils are gonna happen AT gencon.

By the way, now with release of 

greyflood-wanderer-the-three-trials-30.j [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/greyflood-wanderer-the-three-trials-30.jpg]

 

the Mirkwood Pioneer appears more clear to me:

 

MEC29-cardfan-01.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/the-ringmaker/MEC29-cardfan-01.png]

 

Something like:

You may give Mirkwood Pioneer doomed 1 when you play it from your hand. If you do, it gains: "Response: After you play Mirkwood Pioneer from your hand, choose an enemy/location (location more likely) in the staging area. Until the end of the round, chosen card does not contributes it's threat."

## 63 [joezim007 on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1187984)

Good Insight. Needs some edits though: it's not specifically "enemy" or "location". It's just "card", which is supported by the words "chosen card" rather than "chosen enemy/location". Also, "until the end of the round" is too short. See my mockup below to see what I mean.

 

Mirkwood-Pioneer.png [http://www.joezimjs.com/_uploads/Mirkwood-Pioneer.png]

Changing "round" to "phase" doesn't do much for length and doesn't make sense anyway. I can't think of what it should be.

## 64 [joezim007 on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1188005)

Figured it out. Needed to add "the" in front of "chosen card". Great deduction Trolo. Here's is the wonderful card we discovered together:

The added doomed cost on these cards kind of sucks- you're already paying for them, it only triggers when they enter play and you have to raise everyone's threat... that's why I don't like Greyflood Wanderer, 3 cost and doomed 2 is terrible to me but could be helpful in certain situations. This Mirkwood Pioneer however looks real good, only doomed 1 is great. And another random trait: Woodman... lol

 

Anyways, this quest is really fun and has great replayability but is definitely more difficult with one player as you have to deal with all the guardians at the end by yourself and they all attack multiple times.. so brutal, I've died many times   ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I agree. I don't think Greyflood Wanderer should have Doomed 2. I think doomed 1 would have been just fine. Also, his cost of 3 is slightly on the high side. He just doesn't have a whole lot going for him right now, though I think as Dunedain and Scout traits flesh out, he'll be more desirable.

## 67 [Catastrophic09 on August 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1188389)

Yeah for sure, right now there are much better 2 cost Spirit allies so I'm hoping for his traits to make him better in the future.

## 68 [MyNeighbourTrololo on August 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1188511)

I think, optional doom is a good touch. You may play him if you need his stats, but you're not forced to trigger his doomed ability unless you desire to. Greyflood Wanderers ability may not seem much for singleplayer, but it could mean a lot for multiplayer, especially in 3-4 player game, where staging area is filled with locations.

## 69 [Catastrophic09 on August 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1188582)

True, it is nice having the option and gives more value to a card so this will be nice on future cards but for the Wanderer specifically it seems that his cost is one higher than it should be, there are many superior options for a 2 or 3 cost ally if you just look at his stats. Therefore it appears that his ability is part of him costing 3 instead of 2 but that means that ability costs you an extra resource and doomed 2, so even though its a powerful ability and could be amazing at certain times, I just don't think I'll play him much.

## 70 [MyNeighbourTrololo on August 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1188611)

If we compare his stat block to other 3 cost spirit allies, he's pretty decent.

His combined stats are 2+1+0+2=5, which is an average combined stat score for a 3-cost spirit ally. Also, out of 3-cost spirit allies, all who can beat him are unique allies and Shipwright(if paired with 3 spirit heroes). So, if you're not running a monospirit deck and want a decent quester with an extra kicker if needed - Greyflood Wanderer is a pretty decent choice.

Perhaps but he doesn't have defense and only has 5 total stat points. It's good that he's not unique and his ability is also useable so he can definitely fit in some decks, but won't be in mine currently.

## 72 [MyNeighbourTrololo on August 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1188650)

Oh man, I somewhat assued me has 1 point of defense. Regardless, who's gonna defend with him?

He's a quester with more than 1 health, that's all I'm worried about.

Got the package.

Each 2B stage writes that "each Guardian enemy engages the first player". Why there is the word "each" ? Isn't only one Guardian in play in each stage or they are all in?

There is a trechery card that puts a guardian from victory display into play. I don't know how you could play this quest and missed that.

Ian included Greyflood Wanderer in his location control deck for The Old Forest and it was quite effective. In the early game, with many locations in the staging area, his ability was quite powerful. In the late game, he still quests well for the cost, or can be used as a chump blocker in case of emergency. The thing to remember with these doomed allies is that you don't have to add the doomed cost, and the card can still be useful. The advantage of including them is that it provides another option, in case you need it. Making your decks more versatile is a good idea, and some of these allies will be very effective in certain scenarios - just like the Wanderer was in The Old Forest.

Thinking more about Greyflood Wanderer, would you take him ahead of Northern Tracker?  NT costs one more resource, but 2 less threat and is a repeatable source of progress.  Maybe you take both, but I'll take the venerable Tracker ahead of GW.

The Trial of Perseverance is just a joke, use Saruman to let the location leave play, and you can get through it....

And the barrow location will remain there to bug you until the end of the game.

## 84 [danpoage on August 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111609-your-trials-begin/?do=findComment&comment=1220568)

The Old Forest is very location heavy. Most of the locations have victory points. The first stage is simply a "setup" stage and then players move to a random stage 2 (of which there are 4). Players keep going from one random stage 2 to the next at the end of each round, until they have accumulated 5 times the number of players worth of victory points (from locations) in the victory display. Once this happens, the players instead move to stage 3 at the end of the round. There are some enemies, and they can be dangerous if you don't plan carefully, or get caught over-questing. The worst enemy makes an immediate attack from the staging area at strength 4 against the first player, whenever the active location is explored.

 

Many of the locations have terrible passive effects that apply while they are in play: e.g. players cannot heal, players can only play 1 card from their hand each round, progress must be placed on this location before the current quest. There is also a location with a forced effect that makes a player raise their threat by X when optionally engaging an enemy (X is the enemy's Attack). This made it harder for the combat-focused decks to help the quest-focused decks. Sentinel on Elrohir was very helpful (Elven Mail is amazing). I even managed almost the entire game without a copy of Steward of Gondor, so I had Errand-riders frantically transferring my other resources so that he could defend multiple attacks.

 

Each stage 2 does something different, and one of them removes a location from the victory display, which could make this quest almost impossible solo (or without serious location-control). They all have a passive that triggers if there are less than X locations in the staging area at the beginning of the round, you have to add locations until you have X. (X = # of players). For us, in a three player game we almost always had at least 3 locations in play. This is why Greyflood, Northern Tracker, and especially Asfaloth were so important. No surprise, Idraen is beyond amazing in this scenario. Also Elf-stone and Ancient Mathom are highly recommended.

 

The last stage is no joke. First you add Old Man Willow and Withywindle to the staging area, then you reveal number of players - 1 cards from the encounter deck. Old Man is indestructible, immune and cannot leave the stage area. He attacks each player for 5 each round and raises the threat of the defending player by removing more locations from the victory display. When we beat it, I spent my precious Leadership resources to play Faramir and everyone quested with every single character they had to clear the Withywindle (which must be explored to win) and put the 18 progress on the 3B. My threat and Ian's were both at 47 and Matt H's threat was around 43. Ian and I would have likely died that round to threat increase, not to mention the attacks of multiple enemies. It was a thrilling, "by the skin of our teeth" type of victory. The Old Forest is beatable, and had we all built specifically for it, or had a drawn a Steward earlier, we probably could have done better. Still, I suspect that players who go into it blind with decks that lack a strong mix of location-control, questing and combat will be very frustrated.

 

Some of the treacheries are basically must-cancel in multiplayer. The worst was probably "Falling Branches": Each player removes a character they control from the quest. If the chosen character is a hero, deal 2 damage to it, 3 damage instead if it is an ally. Absolutely brutal in the early game when the risk of location lock is looming. It also totally throws off your willpower calculations. Eowyn and Protector of Lorien are really helpful as well, since it helps to be able to control your progress down to the point. Good old Bombadil will show up from time to time, great stats and helps with the quest, though he goes away at the end of the round. Sadly, we lost him as a shadow card a couple times in the game that we won - he certainly would have made combat less dangerous, especially in the later rounds. Anyway, the fact that it is challenging, and thematic, and part of the Saga, makes it one of my new favorites.
