The Response action on this card says you can search your deck for 1 Song card and add it to your hand.  Does this mean you can pick any Song card you want from your deck, or do you need to search through your deck in order starting with the top card and add the first Song card you find?

 You get to look through the entire deck and choose any Song. Otherwise, the card would stipulate limitations similar to those on The Eagles are Coming! or Mustering the Rohirrim ("Search the top X cards of your deck."). So, go fetch them tunes!

Edit: More precisely, to achieve the limited search effect you suggested in the second part of your post, the Minstrel's ability would have to be something along the lines of "Reveal cards from the top of your deck until you reveal a Song. Add that card to your hand, then shuffle the other revealed cards into your deck." However, the card imposes no such restrictions, so you have free choice of any Song in your deck.

Thanks, that's what I thought.  Makes this card very useful.

Ride to ruin only works on Rohan cards.

Embarrassing...

My thought went straight to Gleowine. :^)
