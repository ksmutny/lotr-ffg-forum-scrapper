 Hi!  ? Re: return to mirkwood and the player gaur ding gollum at the end of each round.  When it says to raise that players threat by 3, is that instead of the normal 1, or in addition to it?  (3 or 4 basically?). We've been playing it is 3+1.

I've seen this question on a few discussion boards already and everybody agrees that it is an additional effect (because there is no "instead of 1" there). So, you are correct - it would be 3 + 1 threat increase for the guarding player.

I got the feeling FFG is demolishing soloplay recently. Have you seen "Orc Raiders" from Road to Rivendell?

i have to disagree...all adventure packs in the mirkwood cycle are solo friendly apart from RTM, emyn muil and dead marshes are simple enough with the right deck, HFG is annoying but fun enough, and i was 1 round away from beating RTM last night solo, also i do not think orc raiders are that bad

this game solo is alot easier now than it was in april/may after its release, ive said this in another post, but these scaling issues are only going to get better with time
