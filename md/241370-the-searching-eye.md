The FAQ at 1.44 says (although The Searching Eye doesn't use the word "must"):

If I draw The Searching Eye when at least one (but not all) of my heroes is exhausted, may I choose the first option, or must I reveal an encounter card? I think the question boils down to whether exhausting some of my heroes counts as performing "exhaust each hero you control" in full.

"Exhaust" can't happen to an already-exhausted character, so I would think that "exhaust each hero" can only be performed in full if all your heroes are ready.

Yeah, that's how I read it too. This is a rough card!
