From looking at the picture on the description page it looks like there are two game pieces(cards) that have number dials on them, I wonder what they will be used to represent?

## 3 [Toqtamish on August 3, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=337273)

My guess is its for tracking threat level.

That does seem likely from the cards that we've seen.

## 5 [Toqtamish on August 3, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=337284)

Yup, I just wish I could zoom in some more to see the cards on the description page better. One looks like Elrond to me, one looks like Gimli and one could be Boromir's horn.

## 6 [LordMalinari on August 4, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=337592)

From the image properties of the image on the Description page, another Evil creature card is most probably going to be named Swamp Spectres (art by Mark Winters if anyone cares :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) 

## 7 [cootewards on August 5, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=338213)

Looking at a close up of the layout image from the description page. I would suggest the horn card is called:

Horn of Gondor.

As the last word looks very much like it starts with a G

## 8 [Frank36 on August 5, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=338224)

If Thorin Oakenshield is alive in this game will we also see Smaug ?

It does seem to suggest that FFG might well have the license for more of Tolkien's works than just LotR. Fingers crossed anyway.

Will be very interesting to see just how the scenario cards work, as that might very well give a guild as to what sort of themes we'll see in the later releases

## 10 [Barbacuo on August 5, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=338277)

There will be demos at GenCon, hope somebody brings us the info.

## 11 [Toqtamish on August 5, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=338305)




 

If Thorin Oakenshield is alive in this game will we also see Smaug ?

 

According to the intro article it takes place between near the end the Hobbit and just before the start of the FotR, so it is possible.

I didn't have a chance to play, but i skimmed through the rules - yes those dials show threat, although they weren't ready for Essen and were represented by D30 IIRC

It would be awesome if Toqtamish would update the first post with a collection of all cards mentioned in this thread.

edit: Also here: boardgamegeek.com/images/thing/77423/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game [http://boardgamegeek.com/images/thing/77423/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game]

Already done, sadly editing on this forum is less than easy.

## 18 [Narsil0420 on December 19, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=397674)

I did a small list just to put down the heroes we know about so far. It looks like there will be three heroes from each sphere of influence in the core set. Therefore, we already know all the Leadership Heroes (I thought that was kind of cool...) Feel free to add any info you have to the spreadsheet or ask any questions. I love doing these nerdy little projects...

Cheers!

List is updated with most recent preview article's cards.

## 20 [ClydeCloggie on January 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=403412)

Daughter of the Nimrodel and Golden Wood Priestess are most probably the same card, with Daughter being the definitive version.

Yup, older versions of the cards have a different icon order, which is one way to tell.

@Toqtamish:

Hey man, did your lotr card game website go down?

## 23 [Toqtamish on January 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=408614)

Yeah I killed it, lack of time and energy to keep trying to put it together.

 

Card list updated.

## 24 [jogo on January 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=410586)

If we finally get the full game we could ask the guys at deckbox.org if they make a LotR section.

## 25 [Darksbane on January 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=413084)

Hey guys, I just started up a LotR section on CardGameDB [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler]. I currently have entered in all the cards I could find. If anyone sees any I'm missing let me know. I'll be working on a database search soon and a deckbuilder once more information is released on the game.

If anyone has any suggestions let me know.

## 26 [Narsil0420 on January 24, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=413434)

On the "Rules?" thread, there was a link posted to a French preview of the game. On that page there was a picture of the Shadow Key Item card, in French. I tried to do a rough translation of the text of the card and I thought it would be best posted in this thread.

Shadow Key

Item

 

Encounter. Restricted.

Action: Raise your threat by 2 to recover this item if no encounter is attached to it. When it is claimed, attach Shadow Key to a hero that you control. (Counts as an attachment. If this card is detached, return Shadow Key to the staging area).

Forced: At the end of each turn, the attached hero suffers 1 damage.

## 27 [Narsil0420 on January 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=414275)

 I just noticed ( I don't know why it took me so long...) a new Hero! His name is Dunhere and he was in a demo back in October. He's the third hero from the Spirit sphere. You can see the picture here:

## 28 [Toqtamish on January 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=414508)

So there is. I see him in that pic, looks Rohirrim almost. Hard to tell for sure.

## 29 [jogo on January 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=415186)

You can even read the card text if you do a full zoom.

## 30 [Narsil0420 on January 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=415671)

Look up Dunhere in the Lord of the Rings index and you'll find out even more!

## 31 [Toqtamish on January 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=416049)

On CoE found: Dunhere was lord of Harrowdale and nephew of Erkenbrand. He was captain of an Éored of the Rohirrim, and a valiant man in his own right. He fought in the First Battle of the Fords of Isen and the Second Battle of the Fords of Isen and met his death in the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. He was buried with the other fallen Rohirrim in the great mound outside Minas Tirith.
 

## 32 [Narsil0420 on February 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=424456)

 I was looking at the french site and picked up a couple tid-bits. One is that Thorin and Celeborn are not in the core set, but they may come out in future adventure packs. Also they woman with dark hair and a cape (on the description page) is Eleanor from Middle Earth Quest! It looks like she might be one of the heroes in the core set! This is all per the guy that helped with the French translation.

Eeeeesh!  I hated the generic characters in Middle-Earth Quest!

Were they actually generic? A friend of mine thought he recognized the name of one of the MEQ heroes from Tolkien's works, which made me think they were all mentioned somewhere.

Pretty sure all 5 were made up and obvious clones of Aragorn, Gimili, Arwen, Legolas etc.  The reason I can't stand them is that they are obvious clones and horribly named.

FFG does not have the license to grab characters from Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, History of Middle Earth etc.

But if any of them are mentioned, I'd be interesting in knowing the book and where they are referenced.

 

## 36 [Frog on February 16, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=425156)

Of course, throwing Arwen's name out there probably won't win you any fans gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] ! Whatever PJ did with her had nothing to do with book-Arwen. As such, I prefer Eleanor = Eowyn. Also, Aragorn apparently lost his balls in his transformation into Beravor in MEQ lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] .

In Middle earth Eleanor is the name of a flower that grows around Lothlorien. Sam Gamgee names his daughter Eleanor after this plant. That's the only reference I can think of for that name in ME.

Just got FFG's summer 2010 release book and it's got a LOTR spread in it.

Includes picture of an Ally called Dead Marsh Hunter and an event called Dunedain Courage, plus an enemy that represents Wargs, but the actual title of that card is hidden.

Could you scan that in for us?

I can send it to someone as an email if i get an address? (I can just about manage that!)

Yes, there's a two side LOTR spread. But it does not show to much. And acording to it the core set has only 216 cards in it not 226 like it was said before.

That's the old number of cards. It used to be 216 and then they increased it to 226. I believe that's the final number.

Yer, it's old info as it still talks about 4 quests in the core set too.

Interestingly, the Dead Marsh Hunter card has a tree icon in the bottom right hand corner and I've also noticed that Gimli (from the preview page) has a hammer in his bottom right hand corner. Are these also old card styles, or are these icons that haven't had an explanation yet?

Just checked Gimli from the FFG preview on Hero's rather than the forum preview post translated from French and the hammer icon has disappeared on the FFG version of Gimli, so something seems to have changed there between initial concept and final product.

The tree icon on the Dead Marsh Hunter is the white tree of Gondor, so i reckon the icons used to represent factions (dwarf for hammer, tree for gondor) but in the latest card design this faction has simply be included in the trait list rather than as an seperate icon.

All irrelevant I guess, but what else have we got to talk about without any more news or a game that is released yet!

Yea, I have noticed too that there have been subtle differences in those icons. I have no idea that they mean, so the only ones that I have been putting in the database are spheres (lore, tactics, leadership, spirit). I would love get an explaination so I can have everything formatted the games release.

Yeah, they did away with the icons in the final versions. we talked about this over at BGG. My theory is that it is harder to refrence an icon (like a horse head) than say "Rohan" in future cards, cards that will apply to certain sub-types. Like "all Rohan characters get plus 1 will"

 Ok so the new avatar pictures are very exciting! I think they're showing us all the heroes from the core set. If you start from the front they're grouped together by sphere.

Leadership:

Aragorn

Theodred 

(Old Dwarf) (any guesses?)

Tactics:

Gimli

Legolas

(Dwarf)

Spirit:

Eowyn

Dunhere

Eleanor

Lore:

Denethor

(Elf)

(Proud Woman)

Any guesses on who the unnamed people are?

## 50 [ClydeCloggie on March 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=435840)

Balin would be my guess for one of the Dwarves. Maybe Arwen is in there as well?

## 51 [BeardFan on March 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=435861)

Tactics: Legolas, Gimli, Thalin

BeardFan - I think You saw the game or the demo in action. At some Game Show in Germany, right? Tell as something more about the game. How it all works, how many card does a players deck have and so on. Share with us Youre knowledge if You can.

Oh, how many of You seen those new avatars? I'm asking becouse those are a great sneak pick at new arts from the game and those are looking amazing.

PS. those characters are interesting. Gimli son of Gloin and Gloin himself, some father and son deck there will be. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

 Glorfindel as Lore? Really? I can justify him in any of the three other spheres, but Lore is a bit odd, in my opinion.

Hang around in Rivendell and Elrond for an Age or two and even a dimwit could learn Lore. And Gloryboy is no dimwit cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif] . Meccg had Glorfindel as Warrior/Sage.

Females in Tolkien's lore are not warriors.Only exception is Eowyn and she fought just once at Pelenor Fields.

Female elves are skilled warriors and can use weapons as good as males can but their duty is to stay out of the battle and heal those who need healing.A female elf takes a weapon and goes to battle if this is the only option she has or if she is in danger.So spirit or willpower is the sphere that fits more at female characters.

I learned a lot from that sage.  Then I learned it was cheaper to keep Halbarad at Rivendell if I wanted to play Marvels Told.  
 

I really like that most of the MEQ heroes made it into the game... even though Eleanor is really just Ayn Rand....

Who is Eleanor? I'm guessing it's not Sam's daughter as the picture doesn't look very hobbit-ish.

Also she cant be Sam's daughter cause in this game we play events before Bilbo's 111 birthday and Sam's daughter was born after the war of the ring.

There is no other character named Eleanor in Middle-Earth.Elanor was a flower in Lothlorien.

## 66 [Toqtamish on March 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=438321)

Actually it takes place between the 111th birthday and the days before Frodo and Sam take off. Either way, its a number of years before the birth of Sam's Eleanor. This Eleanor is just a FFG created character who I am guessing they wanted to add to this game for some variety. After all we can only have so many big name heroes before it would get a bit silly.

## 67 [ClydeCloggie on March 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=438335)

There's also a distinct lack of female characters in LotR (other than Arwen, Eowyn and Galadriel there aren't any unless you really scrape the barrel and come up with Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, Rosie Cotton and Ioreth), so makes sense to have new female characters really.

Eleanor is one of the heroes from Middle-Earth Quest, same as Thalin and Beravor, both of whom are in this game as well.

## 69 [cootewards on March 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=438346)

I'm assuming the heroes also come out as 3 Dwarf, 3 Elf, 3 Rohan and 3 Gondor/Dunedain. Also 3 females, allows a full female party for a player, which I expect FFG think could be an important factor in attracting women to the game. So all these are reasons for the breakdown used in the core set.

On top of that they don't want to load it too front heavy with the big names. or people will pretty quickly complain about the nobodies being added in each adventure cycle.

An interesting question might be, how long will we have to wait until being able to play a full Hobbit party?

Be interesting to see what the sphere breakdown is for each race.

Dwarf: Leadership - Gloin, Tactic - Gimli and Thalin

Elf: Tactics - Legolas, Spirit - Eleanor, Lore - Glorfindel

Rohan: Leadership - Theodred, Spirit - Eowyn and Dunhere

Gondor: Leadership - Aragorn, Lore - Denethor and Beravor

I'm guessing at race for Thalin, Dunhere, Eleanor and Beravor, based on their names I think that's right.

Eleanor is Gondor Noble. You can see her fairly clearly on page 13.

Also Aragorn is Dunedain Noble Ranger. Not Gondor, which makes sense based on the books and not those movies.

Well that does suprise me what with eleanor being an elvish word. so she is.

Well that's my idea of there being some logic to the initial hero selection, gone for a burton.

Isn't Sam's daughter spelled Elanor? And therefore the Elvish word would be spelled that way, as well? I think Eleanor is just a nice human name.

From the French rules :

Glorfindel has 12 threat cost, 3 will, 3 attack, 1 defense, 5 hit points.

He is Noble, Noldor and Warrior.

His text says :

Action : spend 1 resource from Glorfindel's pool to heal 1 damage on a character. (Limit : once per turn).

## 76 [Toqtamish on March 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33526-card-list/?do=findComment&comment=438653)

A hero's threat is simply the sum of their willpower, attack, defence and health, from what I've gathered.

The stats for Bilbo from the first adventure pack disagree. (1 Willpower, 1 Attack, 2 Defense, 2 Health, 9 threat). So there's definitely some kind of modifier aside from just those four stats.

 My mistake, sorry; I was making an assumption based on the heroes I'd seen from the core set, and now I just look silly. Oh well.

And Wallenstein, Tolkien concluded that they are one and the same in an essay of sorts which appears in the final tome of The History of Middle-earth. Basically, after he died, his spirit and body were restored by Mandos under Manwe's command, and he was then sent back to Middle-earth, either with the Istari in the Third Age (in fact, for a short while, Tolkien even considered him as one of the possible Istari), or at some point in the Second Age to help Gil-galad out.

 I would say it is something that can be considered the 'true' history of Glorfindel, as Tolkien held that an elf's name should be unique (which, admittedly, has exceptions as with any rule), and that such a distinctive name is unlikely to appear by coincidence twice. Indeed, in the early drafting of The Council of Elrond, he planned on having Glorfindel recount his part in the tale of Gondolin, but then forgot about that plan, and indeed seemed to forget that he intended them to be one and the same, until about 1972, which is when the essays on Glorfindel have been dated by Christopher Tolkien. He did admit that it was an unfortunate circumstance that if they were two separate people, that they should share a name, and he held that having Glorfindel of Gondolin and Glorfindel of Rinvendell as the same person could in fact enhance the story. But that's my take on what I've read; I don't suppose that we'll ever know without any doubt.
