i just wandered over to the warhammer forum (dont know why i dont play it) and they seem to think that Warhammer is suffering due to FFG's focus on LOTR and it is not getting as many card releases, there was also a point brought up that LOTR may suffer when star wars comes out, is this a point that anyone on here has any input on? Do FFG have a habit of letting card games fade out after new 'exiting' releases that not everyone has an interest in?

the answer is "yes, but sort of not"

When star wars comes out it will be mass advertising, stuff on every page and a constant reliable release of packs and new cards to keep interest levels high. LoTR will not be abandoned, but it will go slightly on the back burner, as the people buying packs, are already fans of the games, and new players will have a large money outlay to catch up.

I do not play War, but look at CoC, that game is probably the least popular of the all LCGs, but it has a steady stream of new content. So no, LoTR will not be abandoned.. not for years and years. Just do not expect the same kind of impact that it is getting now.

That sounds right.

I would guess that if interest in the LotR wanes a bit, and they sell 10 times as many copies of Star Wars games, they would be foolish to develop as many LotR APs as Star Wars APs.  Sales are important to a company.  That's how they get the money to print more cards, and pay everyone's salaries.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I dispute the entire premise of this thread.  What evidence is their for this supposed lack of focus?

So far FFG has released 10 small expansion packs and one deluxe expansion for Warhammer Invasion this year.  They are releasing product for warhammer at the exact same rate that they release product for this game.  I see no reason that star wars should effect either product.

I never came up with the idea for this thread, im just saying what was on the warhammer forum and asking if it applies here as was stated, ive never had any other dealings with FFG so just wanted some ideas on whether this is true or not

I think I know the discussion you are talking about. I don't think it was so much about the lack of new cards, but the lack of updates. It did take a while for new Warhammer updates to be published around that time. The explanation I've heard, is that it was around Gencon time, FFG was heavily committed there and just couldn't keep up the full update schedule. And so, people were concerned about whether FFG was neglecting Warhammer when other games still got updates. The situation has been remedied since and Warhammer has been receiving regular updates. And as Bohemond pointed out, the full schedule of releases has been kept. 

It does make you think a bit, because as has been pointed out over there, games like Star Wars and LOTR come from very popular franchises, whereas Warhammer is more of a niche product. Sure, there are a lot of books and a miniature tabletop game out there, but they are not nearly as well known as Tolkien's books or Lucas' movies. Warhammer probably has a bit of an inferiority complex. Still, halfway into the new cycle, we are now back to debating what cards need to be restricted, so everything seems to be back to normal.
