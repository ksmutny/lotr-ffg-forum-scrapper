# [when exactly are you meant to flip to 1b](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59325-when-exactly-are-you-meant-to-flip-to-1b/)

from the rulebook-

After reading and following any instructions on Side A, players flip
the card to Side B. Side B contains the information
necessary to move to the next stage of the quest.

reading this that means set up them immediatly flip

however i would say it goes like this-

set up quest according to 1a

draw your 6 start cards

then flip and follow out when revealed effects

 

now ive actually been playing it either way which may not be really correct, however given that i know each quest by heart and i take mulligans only if i dont like my start hand, and dont take the set up encounter card into account, i dont think it really matters. i set up the quest draw the cards and reveal 1b all pretty much after each other

the only time i can see it effecting is that if you flip before you draw 6 cards, dont like what you see when comparing player cards to the encuonter card, then take a mulligan thus meaning youve 'peeked' and cheated...however as ive said i dont take mulligans based on the revaled card

 From p.10 of the rulebook, you are supposed to draw your starting hand, and decide whether to mulligan, before setting the quest deck and following the instructions on the quest cards.

 

While I agree that it usually won't make a difference, those are the rules.

thanks for clearing that one up...i think it will probably count on future quests say if one said when revealed- discard 4 cards from your starting hard

Firs you shuffle your deck, draw 6 cards, decide about muligan and then procedure  to setup.

Well, it certainly is a difference in some scenarios. In JdtA you have to set up random encounters which can influence your choice. if it's an enemy, you might want to have an ally with a good defense in your hand. If it's a location, you want to get cards that provide you with WP in your starting hand. Etc.

 

Apart from that I agree that you have to draw your cards before setting up the quest.

This is how we like to play. BUT the "real" rules are that you draw your 6, decide on the mulligan or not and maybe e-draw those 6... then follow 1a, then 1b, then start round 0.

I prefer it the other way as you can mulligan based on board position, then the quest deck gets one more chance to suprise you. .. the way it is now.. why do we even have 2 sides to the quest? 1a should just be a long story flavour text, and 1b have quest set up.

Except when you get a treachery that forces you discard all event cards from your hands... We got that in setup once and we were both holding a ton of events. Really hurt us. I had to double check the order to make sure we really did have to discard.
