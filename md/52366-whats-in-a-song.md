# [What&#039;s in a Song?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52366-whats-in-a-song/)

My gaming group have conflicting ideas on exactly what the "Song" cards utility are.

One camp believes that a song imparts on a hero the ability to spend resources on multiple spheres as well as the generation of an additional resource per turn.

The other camp believes that only the first half of this is the case.

So can a song card allow a hero to generate multiple resources per turn or does it only give them the ability to spend resources on multiple spheres?

They let a character's resources be used for two different spheres. They don't replace the existing sphere icon and they don't give two different sets of resources.

Songs only allow characters to spend resources on multiple spheres.  They do not allow generation of additional resources.

It only gives the character an extra resource icon, allowing their resources to be used for either pool. It does NOT generate an extra resource per turn. Each hero is given one resource per turn, and this isn't related to the icons, it's just part of the first phase of the turn.

They're great for multi-sphere decks I think. I can't wait until they release all 4 types. You can then put together a multi-sphere deck and have enough resources to play whatever.

This is what I thought but I wanted to run it by the community just in case. ****, my friends are going to see the game get that much more difficult.

Thanks everybody
