Just looking at the upcoming LotR release schedule I noticed all the products have the 'Updated' tag on them. What do the updates entail? I'm just starting out and am slowly building my collection. I was just wondering if I should hold off buying the older products and wait for the new. I'm hoping the updates are just for the errata on cards/rules.

updated just means that the shipping info was updated - not that the cards are.
