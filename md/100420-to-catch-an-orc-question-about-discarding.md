When you Search X from the out-of-play deck, do the discarded cards go back into the normal discard deck or do you make a new out-of-play discard deck?  It makes a difference since I'd like to possibly recycle the cards with Will of the West.

I assume they just go into the owner's regular discard pile.  If not stated otherwise, I think you should just follow standard procedure for when a card is discarded.

For me the discarded cards from the out-of-play deck are discarded in a different pile.

They are cards "out of play", of another deck.

So the discarded pile is different...

What do you think?

In other cases, when you have a different deck (like Raven deck in the Antlered Crown AP), they specifically tell you what to do with cards that get discarded.  Lacking a specific direction, I would follow the core set manual's rules: when a player card is discarded, it goes into its owner's discard pile.

Is the player's out of play deck still considered to be normal player deck? Can I use Hidden Cache response when I discarding cards from out of play deck via Searches?

This is correct without clarification from the developers.  There is nothing in the Voice of Isengard rule book that says you have an out-of-play discard pile while playing To Catch and Orc.  It just says you have an out-of-play deck.  It is a bit of a leap to assume you also have an out-of-play discard pile just because you have an out-of-play deck.

No, I would think not and as such you could not trigger Hidden Cache.  Card's referring to your deck most certainly refer to your regular deck.  For example, you are not allowed to use A Very Good Tale to attempt to discard your Mugash's Guards from your out-of-play deck.

I interpret it the other way - yes, you can't interact with your out-of-play deck through means which would normally allow you to interact with your deck (drawing or discarding from it through card effects), but it's still a deck which is yours, thus the wording of Hidden Cache 'your deck' seems to me like it applies. Hidden Cache is discarded from your (out-of-play) deck, I say you can trigger it. I see nothing in the rules that contradicts this, so why deny us a fun combo?

The comparison to AVGT doesn't hold up for me because that would be you directly interacting with your out-of-play deck through a player card effect, which you can't do, but when the cards get discarded from it for the Search keyword they go to your regular discard pile and you can interact with them again as normal, including (I would say) triggering Hidden Cache.

Maybe that is the case, but the searches keyword also has you "reveal the cards" from the top of your out-of-play deck, then discard them.  Them being revealed may mean they are no longer a part of your deck and then Hidden Cache couldn't trigger.  Perhaps it is only supposed to be revealed if it ends up being an enemy, but there is no such clarification in the rules.

 

Two player cards that let you reveal the top of your deck, then subsequently discard the top card of your deck are Hunter of Lamedon and Keen-eyed Took.  In the case of Hunter of Lamedon, it is pretty much the same as the Searches X resolution, but Keen-eyed Took is a bit different as his Action is separate from his Response.

 

I'm not sure why they didn't use "look at" for both Hunter of Lamedon and Keen-eyed Took, but maybe it's important...

Ah, it's about time for the annual resurrection of this thread!

 

I would vote against Hidden Cache working when discarded from the out of play deck.  But not sure really.  Thematically it's a win if it does work.

I got the answer from Caleb:

 

Hi Laco,

No, your out-of-play deck is not the same as your deck, so Hidden Cache cannot be triggered because its trigger condition is not met when discarded from your out-of-play deck.

I hope you’re enjoying The Voice of Isengard!

Cheers,

Caleb
