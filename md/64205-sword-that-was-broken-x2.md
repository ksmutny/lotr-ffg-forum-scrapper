Is there only supposed to be 2 copies of Sword that Was Broken in The Watcher in the Water? I'm sure hoping I didn't drop one between the couch cushions or something sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]

Hey, sorry I can't help you because I don't have that AP.

Just out of curiosity… what it does? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 There's always 3 copies of every card in Adventure Packs, so either you're missing one or it didn't get shipped. If the latter is the case, contact FFG and they'll send a replacement card.

Thats what I thought - so I went through the pack a 3rd time and, yup, I'm a dummy. I stuck in in a sleeve with another cards.

 Ahh, well that's good! FFG is pretty reliable when it comes to shipping replacement parts, but they tend to take some time to get your order processed. Glad you found it!

Uhh! Another card with "Aragorn" in it's text box.

Also, thank you for the link. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
