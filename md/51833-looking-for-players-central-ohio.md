After trying the friend finder to little success, I decided to just post a thread.

As the topic says, I picked up the game at Gen Con and have been playing primarily solo (except when I bug the wife enough).  I live in Delaware, Ohio and would love to meet up in the area to play some - I looked into the board game assosciation and it looks as if they play quite a few games which are older/never heard of.

Thanks!

 I'm in the process of moving into a new home in Clintonville. Maybe around the beginning of September I'll be able to get together for a game or two.

Anyone living around Central Ohio should consider coming to the GGO (Gamer Guild of Ohio) Picnic in Sharon Woods on September 10th. It's a great time to meet some local gamers. I was planning on bringing my copy of the LotR LCG (among other things).
