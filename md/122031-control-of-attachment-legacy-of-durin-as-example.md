Hi guys, ciao from Italy!

I have a little question.

If we are in a game with 2 players, A & B, and A play the attachment Legacy of Durin on a dwarf hero of the player B, this last take the control of the attachment ( as rule book pag.25).

Then if player B play a Dwarf, it will be player B or player A that draw the card?

I think that is the player B itself that draw the card. Is it correct?

I ask because a my friend say that is the player A that have to draw the card because he is the owner of the attachment, even if it is controlled by player B.

Who is right?

Thank you in advance

Player B draws the card.

 

Only the controller of a card can activate its effects (like Actions and Responses) unless the card specifically says otherwise.  Player B activates Legacy of Durin's Response, so Player B draws the card.

 

When Durin of Legacy gets discarded, it will go to its owner's discard pile (Player A).
