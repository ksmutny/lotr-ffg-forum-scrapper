Playing the introduction game, i've noticed a few encounter cards that remove an attachment that "I control". Can I use these cards to remove a condition attachment like Cought in a Web, or do I not count as "controlling" enemy attachments?

 

Thank you,

Adam

you do not control enemy attatchments, to get rid of caught in a web you need a card like miner of the iron hills

 

faq

(1.06) Control of Non-objective Encounter Cards
Players do not gain control of encounter cards unless
control of the card is explicitly granted by a card
effect. When an encounter card (such as Caught in a
Web, CORE 86) becomes an attachment and attaches
to a character, that character’s controller does not gain
control of the attachment.

no, a condition is a seprate "state" than a attachment.

but use these cards to your own advantage. For example moving steward of gondor about your heroes. It is only 2 to cast, and in most multi-sphere decks you end with a ton of resources on a single card. So just discard and place on a new her from the other copy in your hand or the multitude of ways to pull a attachment form your graveyard.

 

I find that the discard attachment treacheries to in fact be a boon and are in fact integral to some strategies for efficient quest completion with some decks.

richsabre is giving the correct explanation.

Nope. Condition is a trait, nothing more; and an Attachment card having that trait doesn't in and of itself change the way it is affected by game rules.

Further, examples for card states in this game are in play and out of play. In some places in the rules Exhausted is also mentioned as a card's state.

This may sound nitpicky, but applying game terms correctly is key to understand the rather complex rules of this game.

w/e same thing... keep getting my terms mixed up between games.. but yeah,the point is an attachment and a condition attachment are diffrent.
