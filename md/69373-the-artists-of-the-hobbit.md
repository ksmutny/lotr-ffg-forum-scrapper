One of the things I really liked about the LotR core set when I first opened it was the variety of artists. I really enjoyed the different feeling each brought to the game.

In the Hobbit Saga Expansion the artists are diversified again, and it looks great! In particular I really enjoy the work of Blake Henriksen. His Nori and Ori look really fantastic and bring a new flavor to the game. His treachery "Wind-whipped Rain" looks awesome as well. I am not sure if he has contributed artwork in the past but I hope they use him again!

I also think Jake Murray's Dori looks awesome, and of course Magali Villeneuve's contribution is beautiful as always. David Kegg's Spare Hood, which is a totally different style, looks really great!

I am glad to see the diversified artists return and hope the trend continues!

What appeals to me with this game is the custom arts and that they did not try to copy Peter Jackson's film but they were more trying to go according to the original Novel. I have seen some other LOTR game not sure which one it was but it had the photos of the characters from the movie and it looked really cheap. I wish I had discovered this game earlier. And I wish FFG would get more involved with people here in the UK. They have really amazing game. They would really need a good PR campaign. Board game nights once a week in local shops.

Possibly the old Decipher LotR CCG. Movie stills were a somewhat unfortunate direction, but the game itself was great.

i agree and think this is the best art of any game i've played…but is anyone not really feeling the trolls? i've not really been disappointed by LOTR:LCG art until these trolls and, on top of that, their images don't "match" the Treacheries what have trolls on them… :-/

impaulm nailed it, the mechanics are great, the theme is solid, but the art really helps to bring it to life, and the variety of artists is great.
