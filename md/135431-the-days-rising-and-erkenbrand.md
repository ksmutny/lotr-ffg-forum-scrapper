Hello,

 

I am curious how these two cards interact with each other. Does the Day's Rising only care about damage from the attack, or will triggering Erkenbrand's ability nix gaining the resource? I can honestly see it either way, but want to clarify which it is.

It was discussed, and it was said the damage were not restrict to "combat damage" so it will not work well.

Ah, thank you. Still usable, but that is a little sad.
