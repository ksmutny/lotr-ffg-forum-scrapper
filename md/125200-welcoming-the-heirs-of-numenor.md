So, ok, as said in a different thread, I created two decks to quest around, one based on Eagles, the other one based on Rohan cards. The decks were solid (I thought): won 4 out of 5 times Journey Down the Anduin; won 2 out of 3 times Escape from Dul-Guldur; won all quests from the Shadows of Mirkwood APs, and the three quests coming with Khazad-Dum core set straight on the first try. Bum, bum, bum.

 

Then I went to Gondor.

 

Set up Peril in Pelargir.

 

Lost. On round two. With 4 out of 6 heroes being destroyed by a horde of savaging Thugs. WTF? Did I miss something? I mean, I'd have expected losing, but at least surviving up to quest stage 2, or something?

 

*puzzled*

Designers sometimes to "break the meta" with new quests. So, basically, what you've encountered is a quest designed against your playstyle, I assume.

Many of us were saying the same thing when it came out. It is beatable, but the bar was raised. Since you didn't make it to stage two I won't spoil the quest for you.

@MNT: LOL... probably. Dunno. I just know that as soon as I sent my guys to quest on round 1 I got 5 enemies in the staging area (3 Thugs, one Zelous something, and another guy), plus a Market. The tricky part is that you have 2 cards revealed during setup, and 2 cards revealed by the active location, plus the usual 2 cards / round. And all enemies had an incredibly low threat. Indeed, I should probably build decks with lower starting threat, and some cards able to damage guys in the staging area (Dunhere + Unexpected courage maybe? Sprit-findel?). Dunno.

 

@Bullroarer: thanks for not spoiling the quest.

 

I was just wondering if others had such a slaughtering experience. Happy not to be alone. And happy to return to deck building trying to find a way to beat the **** thing :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

The main problem I faced in this quest is that it's a battle with a lot of fighting. I needed to quest with Attack, and then somehow deal with all those flooding enemies. My solution was Boromir.

I use Gimli for questing in HoN. He is the beast with some damage, dwarven axe and khazad! khazad!.

Gimli, Beregond and eagles are a really good option in Heirs of Númenor.

Yeah, I had the exactly same experience. Peril in Pelargir has always been brutal for me. I played it maybe 10-12 times and I think I only won 2 games. Generally, I do not really mind losing. Loosing a lot is a part of LotR LCG. But there is something absolutely frustrating about this quest. Perhaps that constant, tedious flood of thugs. I cannot really say why, but I feel more irritated than truly challenged.

 

I am glad I did eventually win. It is now done and I have no desire to play the quest again. It is absolutely my least favorite of all the quests, even though there are harder ones now (not even counting the NM mode). Maybe one day I will come back to it, perhaps with some broken infinite-loop overkill combo deck, just to make the encounter deck suffer my retribution.

 

Also, the theme of Peril in Pelargir does not help. I have just went through Mirkwood, Caradhras ad Moria, but a bunch of drunk thugs is too much for my posse? I eat Trolls for breakfast and have just kicked Balrog's bum, so why make me lose repeatedly to some port tavern punters. It only adds to my irritation.

The Against the Shadow cycle in particular is incredibly difficult.  You won't find Into Ithilien or Siege of Cair Andros any easier, and many of the packs have tough quests as well.   I think that the designers assume that you bought everything in order and with increased card pool wanted to increase the challenge after Khazad-Dum.  

 

The may have gone a little overboard,  many of these quests are the hardest in the game,  decks that crush Journey Down the Anduin and even the dangerous Escape from Dol Guldur are still going to have real problems against the Heirs of Numenor box and beyond.

 

Although if it helps, the Ring Maker Cycle is easier, IMO.  Some difficult quests in there too, to be sure,  but in general I think they realized they may have been a little harsh with the difficulty setting in HoN, and toned it down just a hair for Voice of Isengard.

Well HoN is hard, but it was huge satisfaction when I finally beat all scenarios 2 player with my self made decks and strategy.

 

Awesome cycle - theme, difficulty, e.t.c.

Several scenarios that are fun to play 3-4 player. (Lots of enemies, not so much treacheries).

If you happen to run tactics, consider one-time eagles for questing. Very cheap and very effective.

## 13 [Julia on October 20, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125200-welcoming-the-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=1305892)

Bormoir sounds like a solid option; I'm a little worried of how impactful he can be when playing 2-handed, though. I mean, sure, he'll make things better for one side, but the other deck will still be in trouble.

 

One-time eagles for questing are already in the decks I'm using and they're indeed effective. Still, I think I need to find a way to have some more allies fielded on round one: my spirit / lore deck is a little low on allies, and the tactics / leadership deck requires a couple of rounds to become effective. So, probably go for lower starting threat, effects able to damage enemies in the staging area and some more low-cost allies + Boromir could be an interesting solution.

 

Anyhoo, for now I'm just making a "flight" over the different quests, just to see how the game is beyond Khazad-Dum.

 

Tonight I gave the Voice of Isengard a try: lost the first scenario for a banal mistake (Blade of Gondolin used to pass Stage 1 of the quest, not knowing stage 2 has only 2 time counters... this had some interesting repercussions, plus, suddenly, a host of Dunedan arrived) but had a blast trying it. The time mechanic sounds fun, and encounters look fun too.

 

After finishing the overview of the Scenarios, I'll return more seriously to deck building :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

LOL. That's not so comforting, but I do like challenges :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Thanks for the tp about VoI, tho: your post was the reson to move and try something different tonight.

Put Boromir with Strider and another high threat hero and all the thugs will flock to that side of the table.

I think everyone's had this experience with some quest or another.  Quest trauma.  For me it's Into Ithilien, I haven't picked that one up since my initial win on attempt 13 or 14.  I like Peril in Pelargir personally, and find it to be the most do-able of the Heirs box, and the one I come back to from time to time.

+1 for Tactics Boromir :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Also found myself playing Hero Beorn for the first time when playing through Peril in Pelargir... early game he makes for a great boost to battle questing (or soaking up multiple attacks until he's badly wounded) ...and he's still very useful contributing to attacks if a) its not a battle quest and or b) he's a very wounded bear.

I wish that HoN was even more difficult. I really enjoy Peril in Pelargir.

LOL. Nightmare decks for HoN should be the next in line, I think. You should be satisfied, then!

In Peril in Pelargir I recommend try Theoden / Eomer / Beregond and Eowyn / Eleanor / Prince Imrahil. 

Or Gimli / Legolas / Thalin and Dain Ironfoot / Gloin / Bifur.

I guess personal play style and deckbuilding preferences dictate whichever you find the most difficult. But I absolutely agree the other HoN quests are also very hard. Or, should I say, I find them very hard.

 

Will HoN nightmare mode ever come out? Just the idea of it sickens me. Still, I will of course buy it, even though I will probably never play it. FFG, geniuses of evil.

 

Coming back to vanilla HoN, I do not know what is it about those quest that they score so much on the frustration scale. The difficulty is one thing, but it is not only that, as there is plenty of difficult scenarios that are better received by the general LotR LCG public. I am having hard time grasping the reasons for my personal hatred. So what is it you feel? Is HoN unfair, monotonous, weak thematically?

None of the above. I love Heirs. Took the game in a new direction which I liked.

I'm terrified to see what those nightmare quests would be... I am also extremely thrilled for Steward's Fear.

Although being frustrated by Into Ithilien at the time, it's my favorite of the deluxes currently.

Is it so good the new Gandalf?

 

Thanks everyone for the suggestions and advice :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Indeed, you gave me a lot to think. I was more inclined to consider the deck the most powerful source for defeating quests, but actually a peculiar choice of heroes can have a greater impact on some quests. Need to step back a little and try different combos on Scenarios I know already well, and see how things changes by swapping heroes in the mix :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

He's very powerful in solo. The Elrond/Gandalf duo in particular can get pretty crazy.

Yeah, I first tried my Gandalf deck multiplayer... It was a bit of a bummer, because I needed to think for a while and they were like hurry up you fool.. And so I played a bit to rash and we got crushed there..

Then played solo and got my whole deck out in about 5-7 rounds. I slayed the Black Riders and quested with a lot of allies. My Eagles of the Misty Mountains was at 6 defense. And I had the other two in play as well. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I love the HoN quests, but they are tough and require specific builds. You need to be ready for battle questing, but no quest is exclusively that. Peril works best with staging are attacks, Into Ithilien almost requires cancellation, staging area attack also helps, and you need to pace everything correctly. Siege of Cair Andros is almost mono tactics required, but great fun.

 

Also, it should be mentioned that it really helps to have the card pool of the whole cycle available.

Actully i don't think you need to build up specific deck for HON but you need to change style of playing your deck.

> Actully i don't think you need to build up specific deck for HON but you need to change style of playing your deck. 

 
Well, I know I had to change my deck, so it was different for me. I am rather poor at building decks, so take my comments as you will. But I could not imagine getting through HoN with the same decks that I had made for earlier cycles. I pretty much sailed through Mirkwood + Khazad-Dum with my two or three rotating decks. But then all got smashed by HoN. And I mean massacred, until I switched to some specific tactics heavy deck (if I remember correctly, Boromir became my MVP).
 
As for Gandalf, he feels absolutely fantastic in solo plays. An obvious very strong pairing with Elrond. Gandalf effectively mitigates the luck factor of playing cards with Vilya, while not sacrificing anything but initial threat. Not to mention his great stats. I cannot say about multiplayer, but in solo Gandalf/Elrond deck is tons of fun to play. You get to manipulate your deck, do some fun tricks, lots of draw, and it opens up many options. Gandalf and his attachments create some breathing room when it comes to playing your cards, which in turn refreshes and streamlines the play. I feel he creates more freedom and loosens up the game a bit where perhaps it felt a bit too limiting.

I don't find Peril in Pelargir that hard at all. But you sure need to find a solution for some problems, my mainly used trick:

1. Use Tactics Boromir
2. Take control of the scroll
3. Send him to quest

4. Reveal encounters
5. Ready him before Quest resolve
6. Explore Leaping Fish
7. Survive 2-5 Thugs

Yeah, that No. 7 was always a bit of a problem for me. But I agree Boromir is the man for this.

 

Once the initial brawl settles down it is much more manageable, although I have been murdered by the last stage as well.
