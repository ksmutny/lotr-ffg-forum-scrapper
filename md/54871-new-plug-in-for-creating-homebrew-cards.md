Hi everyone,

a new version of the Strange Eons plug-in is finished. You can download it at http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html] or at Svenn’s page at http://tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/ [http://tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/] (look for LotR Encounter Pack plug-in), who kindly offered to host it, too! As the pool of fan-made adventures is and hopefully will be growing, this plug-in could be a nice tool for card creators.

In the new version it's not only possible to create custom encounter cards, but you can also make homebrew player cards with it! This is possible due to GeckoTH’s high quality templates. Many thanks to him! Also thx to Rhuarc, who notified me about Gecko’s work in the first place ;-) And also to Svenn, for providing a better download option than 4shared!

To install it, first download Strange Eons for free here: http://cgjennings.ca/eons/#Download [http://cgjennings.ca/eons/#Download]
Then, double-click the LotR.seext file, and then it gets installed (or updated). Restart Strange Eons. Afterwards, select a card you want to create, e.g. an ally card:
Create an ally [http://api.ning.com/files/emG38eNymeFVmBMCjSqEKP5QQENEiqdATa9l03tiIQ3PDNTA7LuzalK-49WT*8h8*v-on1KHkAWaXxnDwYB7fstb6*tpGMvF/Lotr_CreateCard.jpg]
Then, a new ally card will be created. Jump to the “Ally” tab to experiment with its properties, and change e.g. its sphere from Leadership to Tactics:
Change its properties [http://api.ning.com/files/oTlWvhTWsv9ESW3tmbTALZC0EoRxb-e97KQ8LbX9HZH6zIjEL30Jwx2PE42WO2iOHcmxDn4RvqJsD0KnAnWAAU3aEk-gGQWQ/Lotr_ModifyAlly.jpg]
Or change its card text. Don’t miss the resource icons new in this version, accessible via the <rta>, <rsp>, <rlo> and <rle> replacement tags. You can see all possible tags in the lower left of the upper picture.
To insert your own card image, go to the “Portrait” tab and select an image to load.

To create a pack of cards with several copies of a card, first create all of cards (only single instances) and save them via File -> Save As. Then, create a card deck in SE:

Create deck of cards [http://api.ning.com/files/wlsmDVS52Dx5pIzhjLiTX*aQLKO2VUmlJTVrtoiLDtkp5*5HjT5N2kzGcMSaqC18KBuxkdSyZbgAVduad4FQF7Ev3xgRX*Nw/LotR_CreateDeckOfCards.jpg]
Then, read and delete the yellow instruction plate, and click on Components - Add Cards to load your cards:
Add saved cards [http://api.ning.com/files/oTlWvhTWsv8se1CfAoPMYq4meylKLlerNeGwS7LuOsQpmm1lrAcmjmeJEt44z5Lt8jiVJ2FQ5Q3glJp7UOEzWup6a5msmJY7/Lotr_AddCardsToDeck.jpg]
Drag as many copies of the cards you want to the sheet:
Drag cards to deck of cards [http://api.ning.com/files/Q7RRZtxQWvPiiDuZQOsbYXuVfwRfYETv2SLQ9igaH7uxgXEH1dBJsLjo5Z1HwIpcEj6LuMZ8mk8N95fX2z9pcdG5Inc-RRSh/LotR_DeckOfCardsFinished.jpg]
Then, save, print, or export to PDF or image files your homebrew cards!

If you’re wondering whether you should use this plug-in or Gecko’s templates, here a list of what my plug-in can do:

 * The plug-in provides a quick and easy way for creating homebrew cards, without GIMP or Photoshop or similar programs.
 * You can easily create decks with multiple copies of a created card.
 * If you need any changes/errata in card text etc., it can be done very fast, just change the card file, save it, reload your deck file again, and then every copy automatically has the new card text.

But of course there are some restrictions/limitations:

 * There are no scans of portraits/texts of cards FFG published. The plug-in is designed for creating custom cards by fans and for fans; you aren’t able to copy the game with it. Next to that, any commercial use of the plug-in is prohibited, of course.
 * The region for e.g. the Artist’s name is fixed; you can’t change it or other regions on a card-by-card basis.
 * The plug-in doesn’t support color gradients for fonts.
 * You can’t re-arrange the general outfit of the card or add other fancy stuff for which I didn’t provide an option (e.g. two-sphered heroes).

If any of the latter 3 points are of importance for you, you’re better of creating your homebrew cards with Gecko’s templates directly. (Or perhaps you can use my plug-in for quickly testing game balance etc., and when you’re satisfied with the textual content, you can use Gecko’s templates to create the final version of the cards.) His templates can be found on BGG, e.g. here: www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/70314/hero-card-template-300dpi-psd [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/70314/hero-card-template-300dpi-psd]. But if you’re looking for an easy and fast way to have your ideas for card creation realized, my plug-in could be of use for you.

Supported languages are English and German at the moment. Other languages are generally possible, if someone is willing to do the translation.

So then, happy card-creating!

I would just like to toss out there... If anyone makes some custom scenarios or anything and needs a place to host them, I am willing to put them up on Tabletop Geeks (for free of course).

Cheers, HilariousPete!

Great work putting this all together and providing an awesome tool for the community. This certainly makes it easy to whip up cards!

I might as well mention that for those of you who would still like to use Photoshop, you can still find my template files over at BGG:

Nice tool!

One problem that I have found out is that it is very difficult keep up with all these new custom made scenarios and cards because they are all shared in different plases...

I am wondering if we could make one portal or site where anyone can save and upgrade their own custom cards... like google docks for LOTR lcg, or something similar? Now the hunting down all these fabulous cards is full time job...

 

So what would we need for that...

 1. some agreement what would be the platform (data server)
 2. Some one who would the "founder" who would give allowance to those who privide their own cards and scenarios
 3. some serious advertisindg in different plases

 

What information would be needed

Scenario:

 1. author
 2. date
 3. version number
 4. name of scenario
 5. difficultu rating
 6. description of scenario
 7. needed adventure decks

Individual cards:

 1. author
 2. date
 3. version number
 4. Card name
 5. card type
 6. sphere
 7. card description

 

Any thoughs?

I've got links to the ones I'm finding over on the Tabletop Geeks Living Resources page [http://tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/]. If you know of any more that should go there, let me know. Also, like I said above if anyone wants me to host their custom scenario I will do that as well. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Very cool

already made one card- although currently just using a fuzzy still from the film, rnadomly found on the internet- can anyone recommend any non-copyrighted artwork out there that would be suitable for stuff?

Thanks for all your encouraging answers!

@Hannibal_pjv: A place where all custom cards are collected/linked is a good idea, but I'm not sure if the version numbers are really necessary. Difficulty ratings and short descriptions (without spoiling too much) would be a good thing. But I think this will be more of an issue in, let's say a year or something, when hopefully there are so many custom scenarios that it's difficult to overview all of them ;-) Meanwhile, name, link and author as provided by Svenn's page is sufficient, I guess.

@Mighty Jim: I also found it difficult to get good images. You can try elfwood.com [http://www.elfwood.com] and deviantart.com [http://www.deviantart.com]. There are some awesome pics. But it could be difficult to use the pictures. (All rights are reserved usually, so you got to ask for permission first. At elfwood chances could be better, but on deviantart there are also many artists who provided scans of their commissions, so I think they can't allow you to use them.) You can search on flickr.com for paintings only with creative commons license (use the advanced search). And you can search on wikimedia commons http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Paintings]. Usually, these pics are pretty old and it's legal to use them, but it's difficult to find something which is at least somehow usable for The Lord of the Rings...

If you guys want a page with more info than just name, author, and link I could set up a specific scenarios page with more detail. Doesn't take long to toss up a new page. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Honestly, I'm not much into playing custom scenarios myself, but if it holds interest for other people or generates more interest in the game I'll put up whatever you want. Let me know what the best way to go about it would be. As I said, I'm definitely willing to host up files for anyone who needs a place to put them. I'm also trying to put links to other scenarios I've seen around.

 A database of all the known custom scenarios has already been set up over at BBG:

The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game - Adventure Database [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/72931/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-adventure-da]

This list also allows players to rate all the scenarios, providing others with a way to see which ones are the favorites. This list also stays up to date even if someone updates their custom scenario to a new version!

How do I insert custom icon for encounter set when creating scenario?

It would be nice if you could insert tool for creating card dividers in this beautiful plugin.

Thanks

Set the "Encounter set" to "Custom icon" and the insert the Filename (here C:TempNewIcon.png) of the picture in the "Custom icon" textfield like this:

Custom Encounter Set Icon [http://api.ning.com/files/rCy4545DfsiQ19yR5kTrt2tdNI5xdMK5g6yaA7SOq2*HWggj2HVBj7pQN2pnxfzsesDbJ*xB1Jod8I4qeH*er1Y3nCVjRarx/Custom.jpg]

For quest cards, the procedure is the same, go to the "Front side" tab and insert the filename if you want it to appear in the frame of the small icons, or go to the "Common" tab for the big icon.

If you want to create your own icon, make sure that the surroundings of the circle are set to 100% transparency (use png or jp2 for this), otherwise you'll get a rectangle drawn above the template background.

 

I fear I won't be able to add card dividers. I have no experience/skill at painting, so I can't create a template image for dividers (inserting the encounter set icon or sphere icon wouldn't be a problem, but the background image is...) Perhaps I can extract the ornaments from the Adventure Packs rulesheets and put it together somehow... I'll keep it in mind and will try it. (But you better don't expect anything, I don't think the chances for me are good ;-))

Greetings, Pete

Been using this a bit- generally seems like a really nice piece of software

just one problem

every time I re-open a hero, the image has been re-sized to 64% - this means that when I try to put multiple cards into a deck for printing, I've got tiny images in the middle of big white gaps

anyone know why this is/how to alter it?

The new version 2.1 is out at http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html]. The scaling bug is removed. Additionally, The Hills of Emyn Muil encounter set icon is included and selectable for quest and encounter cards.

Not bad. I am not sure how messy this will after there is 100+ scenarios out there... The It would be easier if you could some how filter those scenarios besed on what  Epic journey the quest belong, difficulty level etc. But that would need somekind of database...

Even now, when there are only 25 scenarios, it takes some time to find out what you are looking for. Allso the information is a little slim. Only the name and difficulty at this moment. But even now this is very usefull! I am just being afraid that arter more scenarios are released, it may become more and more difficult to find what you are looking for.

The summary in the top of the page is the most important part of this portall! It should give some information: difficulty and average rating and quick link to the host page (where the files and additional information can be found) Maybe nothing more, so that the "Link"-list woud remain easy to read. So actually it is guite good as it is now, The only "killer" feature missing is the link to the host page. And because the scenario list is an picture at this moment, it can not be easily added. So normal list with a link would be easier to do, byt then the rankin system would be difficult to maintain... Hmmm... maybe they could be separed from each other?

Thanks for all the ansvers!

I looked your page and it definitely has a lot of stuff in there! So a separate page for scenarios could be more "user" friendly happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]
If you host files, then small introduction to scenatio would be nice. If you only provide link, then the host of linked scanario is better place for information. I am not sure how much and how often scenario makers update their old scenarios, but if they do, the information conserning the scenario can become obsolete quite soon, so It is allways easiest, if the maker of the scenario provides the deeded information. "What are special rules", what cards go to the encounter deck, and what don't. Any other rules that are not normal (many scenarios provide scaling rules) And story line introduction is allways nice to have! It adds so much flavor to the scenario!

The most easy thing would be if people start using Quest sheet template along their custom scenarios!
http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71627/quest-sheet-template-300dpi-psd [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/71627/quest-sheet-template-300dpi-psd]

You would just have to store the the Quest sheet that contains all scenario information and pdf that contains the nesessary cards. After that only thing what you would have to do is provide list of scenarios: the name, maker and difficultu and lin to those two files.

Quick question, I may be just dumb an missed it, how do I add stat icons into the text of the card. :/ ie: "+1 (shield)" for defence.

Strange Eons is Java. It runs on Linux, and I assume it runs on Mac too.

@Xealous:

It's accessible via typing    <ds>      An overview of all replacement tags is in the lower left of the Strange Eons window (when you create an event card and go to the "Event" tab).

There's another way, with which you can define the size of the icon. Click into the textbox in whose text you want the icon to appear. Go to Toolbox -> Image Resource Browser. (If the Image Resource Browser is not there, you've got to download it: Toolbox -> Catalogue -> Select teh browser and download and install it). Then go to the Lotr/templates folder and search for "DefenseStrength.png". You can bareley see the preview because it's black on black. Then click on "Insert mark-up" and close the browser. You'll see that this text will have been added:

<image "res://LotR/templates/DefenseStrength.png">

Change it to

<image "res://LotR/templates/DefenseStrength.png" 2 0.5>

The first number is for width, the second for height.

 

@Bungo_Underhill & Zeb:

Right, as far as I know SE and the plugins are Java/JavaScript. So there's a good chance that it will run on MAC. Since I don't have a MAC, I cannot guarantee it (or help you in case it doesn't work sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]). But it's sure worth a try.

I think I found a little bug in the plugin. (While browsing over this thread, I haven't seen it already posted - sorry if it was already mentioned)

When you create an Event Card and change the sphere to neutral the little circle containing the sphere icon doesn't vanish as it should.

(And a little cosmetical error: If you create a hero-card, the displayed custom-card is Galadriel. She has the traits Noble and Silvan. That's wrong, Galadriel is a Noldor.)

 

I hope this helps,

 Hey there,

I only recently found about the existence of this plug-in and thought I'd offer the following:

1. There is a new version of Strange Eons inching closer to completion that will provide better support for games other than Arkham Horror (in fact, AH will become an optional plug-in just like any other game). Although many plug-ins that add support for new games will continue to work (when a "compatibility mode" is set), a little extra work is needed to take advantage of the most powerful new features. In any case, most plug-ins need only minor changes. Get in touch with me and I'll help you make the transition.

This version will make the larger Strange Eons API available to plug-in developers for the first time, as opposed to just the script libraries. I expect to see people doing some pretty amazing things, since I'm already amazed by what people do with the much smaller palette currently available to them.

2. You are welcome to include the plug-in in the plug-in catalogue if you want to. Let me know.

Cheers,
Chris

Thanks! I'm always looking for such errors/mistakes. The resource circle of neutral events will be eliminated in the next update (or are you currently working on a neutral event card? I could release the next version of the plugin earlier, if you need it).

And Galadriel will also be Noldor, then ;-)

 Hey there,

I only recently found about the existence of this plug-in and thought I'd offer the following:

1. There is a new version of Strange Eons inching closer to completion that will provide better support for games other than Arkham Horror (in fact, AH will become an optional plug-in just like any other game). Although many plug-ins that add support for new games will continue to work (when a "compatibility mode" is set), a little extra work is needed to take advantage of the most powerful new features. In any case, most plug-ins need only minor changes. Get in touch with me and I'll help you make the transition.

This version will make the larger Strange Eons API available to plug-in developers for the first time, as opposed to just the script libraries. I expect to see people doing some pretty amazing things, since I'm already amazed by what people do with the much smaller palette currently available to them.

2. You are welcome to include the plug-in in the plug-in catalogue if you want to. Let me know.

Cheers,
Chris



Yes, I'd like to adapt the plug-in to the upcoming API changes and any help is appreciated, and the plug-in catalogue sounds also like a good thing! I'm getting in contact with you via your website's formular

Greetings,

Pete

Pete, thanks for making this great plug-in.  By and large, it works terrifically well.  Just one major issue, though, that the unique symbol doesn't seem to export for some reason.  I also find some of the default text sizes to be a little off... for example, the Trait field (e.g., Item. Dwarf. Artifact., etc.) seems like it should be size 7 instead of 7.5, and the flavor text should be size 5.  But that can all be adjusted personally, whereas the unique symbol export issue is definitely a bug that you would need to look into.

And many thanks again to Chris for the mighty Strange Eons!

You're welcome! Thanks for posting these issues. I work on them. I'm pretty busy right now and I also found another bug which I want to eliminate in the next version, so it could take some time until everything is finished. Meanwhile there's a workaround for the bug about the unique symbol in the title: Don't use <uq>, but <image "res://LotR/templates/Unique.png" 0.26>. Does this work for you? This would also offer the opportunity to change the size of the unique symbol (0.26).

Greetings,

Pete

Hello,

I find this software is amazing and I introduced it on the french non-official forum, it has some fans already !!

Two of the (many) questions :
- How may I translate it to french (menu/interface)
- How may we modify the card type (french for "Hero" is "Héros", "Location" is "Lieu", ...)

Thanks again and let me know how I can make the translation (and complete the icon too maybe) !!

Great that you're spreading the software, and also that you want to translate it! The plug-in is adaptable for different languages, so any help for e.g. a French version would be appreciated :-)

Actually, the card types are translatable strings, too. So that shouldn't be a problem. More problematic could be special characters like with accent cédille. I send you a PM with more informations!

A new version of the LotR LCG Custom Card Creation plug-in is there, v 2.2! Changes from the last version are some bug fixes (most notably, the <uq> tag is now working in the card title), new Encounter set icons up to Khazad-Dum, and the Encounter set card numbering under the Encounter set icon, and support for French. The plug-in is available at 4shared [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html] or at Svenn’s resource page [http://tabletopgeeks.com/living-card-game-resources/].

Many thanks go to (in no order):

 * Shiv@n and the French community for translating and beta-testing
 * Svenn for providing a better download place then 4shared
 * Grudunza and Doom1502 for bug reporting
 * GeckoTH for his superb templates. They are accessible on BGG e.g. here [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/70830/location-card-template-300dpi-psd] and are really usefull if you want to do some new stuff like dual-sphered cards or color transition of a font.
 * Chris Jennings for providing and supporting Strange Eons
 * I hope I didn’t forget anyone ;-)

Hi,

thank you very much for this plugin, I love it, I'm more in the mood for creating cards than playing with them... (partly due to my brother buying the game and he is the tolkien fan, not me... don't hit me please) 

However, I made some cards and my laptop crashes. No worries, every data is fine... Still, I can't re-open the cards I made because of a java error.

I had this error on my previous laptop when I installed the french patch... (thank you for that too) so it's not because I was on xp and now on seven.

It's more likely due to me inserting color tag in the hit point and threat cost (I found the blue and red too shiny, example : <color #444444>7</color>) and it seems to works fine until you re-install strange eons.

 

Uncaught java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: setSelectedIndex: 5 out of bounds

Perhaps the text field for the cost is hidden because the left side of the screen is too small? It looks like this on my machine:

Thanks! There was colour codes in the same slot ad I didn't look carefullu enough, that there were the cost number in the same slot.

One new question. Is it possible to somehow import new template to Strange Enouns? And if it is, how and in what format. I wan't to try new card type that don't have ready template allready.

It's possible, but it's not easy. At least to my knowledge. When I created the plug-in, I had to create a new card type for the enemy cards, for the location cards, for the quest cards and so on... You'll need to do the same for your new card type. You'll need some pogramming capability (JavaScript), a template picture file, and some basic knowledge of SE and its interface to plug-ins. You can start by taking my LotR plug-in and only adding a new card type, that'd be easier than creating all new from scratch. SE is documented well in general, there are examples on how to create a new card type / extension and so on e.g. here [http://cgjennings.ca/eons/tutorial/extensions.html] and here [http://cgjennings.ca/eons/tutorial/diy.html].

I don't know how many cards you plan to create, but as a rule of thumb, you'll only profit from creating your own card type if you plan on creating a lot of cards of that type. Don't try to create a new card type for SE if you only want to make 4 cards or something, you're better off just designing them in Photoshop or Gimp...

If you have any questions, or need some help / info about plug-ins in SE, don't hesitate to ask me!

Greetings,

Pete

If you go to BGG you can find the original Photoshop PSD files that Pete used for the SE plugins. You will need Photoshop or a app that can open PSD files.. I think there is a open source app called GIMP that can do this.

Anyway.,. this might be your best bet, as it is a fully editable PSD file,

Hello everyone, there's a new version of the plug-in out, v 2.3!

 

Next to some bug fixes (thanks to alogos!), there is another new feature: card dividers! If your collection is growing like mine, they can help you keep your cards sorted. Here is a picture of an example:

generaly.jpg [http://img52.imageshack.us/img52/7058/generaly.jpg]

You can change the background in the Portrait tab, if you like:

otherbackground.jpg [http://img837.imageshack.us/img837/3819/otherbackground.jpg]

Many thanks to Shiv@n, who came up with the idea and also created template pics for me!

Two notes though: First, I haven't included all the encounter set lists for each quest, MaO is the only quest with a card list, and I also haven't included the titles for each quest. It is just too much work to create or maintain the lists in at least 3 languages… Shiv@n is working on some French dividers, though! Second, you'll notice that when you change the divider type from the default (Encounter) to something else (e.g. Lore), the title texts are changed; but when you go back (to Encounter again), it doesn't change back. This is because I wanted to save the user from typing "Lore", when he already has selected the Lore divider; but at the same time, I only want to overwrite the title if it is the very first default title of the encounter divider.

You can download it from 4shared here: http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html]

Many thanks to HilariousPete for providing us with such a magnifient tool!

I am using the plug-in on my Mac and have a problem: The bold and italic text commands (html) are not working on the card text, alignment and size do work though. Any idea how to fix that?

Thanks!

I'm sorry, but I fear I can't help you. I don't have a Mac myself. But you can try to create some Arkham Horror game components (e.g. an investigator) and see if bold / italic formatting is working there. If not, you could try to contact Chris Jennings (developer of Strange Eons). If yes, then the problem lies in my code, but chances that I can find it out are small…

Hi Pete,

I opened/created  couple of CoC-LCG cards and the bold/italic commands do work, the text changes on the fly as I typed in the commands. Afterwards I openend several different LotR-cards (your card examples) and bold/italic was not working. I understand you cant solve this problem as you are not using a Mac.

BTW, where did you find that CoC LCG plug-in?

Sorry, I meant Arkham Horror not CoC LCG. I dont play any of the two so I assumed the cards are for CoC LCG (FFG uses the same artwork anyway).

(The Arkham card tool is incuded in Strange Eons by default)

 What do people recommend as the best way of exporting cards once they've been made?

I don't have any zipping-unzipping software. I can print them on my own computer, but not sure how best to share the custom quest I've made with others…

## 63 [Memetix on September 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=690779)

Once I've created all the cards in Strange Eons I then use it to create a Deck of Cards (File->New …. Decks and Expansions …. Deck of Cards)

I then import each of the cards and lay them out (fronts on one page, backs on another) and then save (usually as <questname>.eon) then export them (File Export …. Custom Settings … JPEG/lossless/300dpi).

This will create a zip file containing the jpeg files in a format suitable for sharing.

Hi, first let me tell you, that I enjoy using this plugin. But I ran into a little Problem, because I use Strange Eons for Arkham Horror too. It seems the tool does not like to have 2 card types with the same name (there are ally cards in both games). Whenever I create an ally for Arkham Horror, the portrait has its most left boundary chaged to almost the center of the card, so the portrait is only visible on the right side. If I try to nudge the picture, it does move, but it is still only visible on the right side of the card. The pixels just "vanish" once they hit this border in the middle of the card. Is there a workaround for this problem?

## 66 [HilariousPete on November 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=719854)

@Hannibal_pjv: Yep, that's right, I'm working on it :-)

@Ranwyr: Thanks for telling me about this bug! I have eleminated it in the next version. You were right with the assumption that the reason lies in identical naming (ally). If you want to design an AH ally in the meantime, as a workaround you can uninstall the LotR plug-in, then the problem should disappear. Please inform me if this doesn't work for you. In that case I could also send you a preliminary version just without the bug.

I checked the font file, and only that one is missing (for Spanish).

I'd like to help translating the plug-in to Spanish. I think transaling the files within /resources/lotr/text is most of the translation done. Any other file to take care of?

Hi all,

the new version of the plug-in is getting more and more complete… Does anyone have a Spanish version of the Silmarilion and LotR at hand? There are some quotes for the card templates that we'd like to cite from the Spanish books.
Here are the (English) quotations:

It seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many times. -The Fellowship of the Ring (Chapter 11, Knife in the Dark, Book 1 of the Fellowship)

"At first we were weary and danger was too close behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness on the fair paths of Lórien." -Legolas, The Fellowship of the Ring (Chapter 7, Mirror of Galadriel, Book 2 of the Fellowship)

"But death in battle may come to us all yet, willing or unwilling." -Faramir, The Return of the King (Chapter 5, Book 2 of Return of the King)

And in that time also … the Enchanted Isles were set, and all the seas about them were filled with shadows and bewilderment. -The Silmarillion (Chapter 11, Sun+Moon+Hiding of Valinor)

He took his harp and sang a song of Valinor… Thus Fingon found what he sought. -The Silmarillion (Chapter 13, Return of the Noldor)

I don't have a Spanish edition Silmarillion… yet. But I do have my Spanish lotr ao I'll quicly post the translated quotes for that one:

the new version of the plug-in is getting more and more complete… Does anyone have a Spanish version of the Silmarilion and LotR at hand? There are some quotes for the card templates that we'd like to cite from the Spanish books.
Here are the (English) quotations:

It seemed to him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it flashed and faded many times. -The Fellowship of the Ring (Chapter 11, Knife in the Dark, Book 1 of the Fellowship)

"At first we were weary and danger was too close behind and afterwards we almost forgot our grief for a time, as we walked in gladness on the fair paths of Lórien." -Legolas, The Fellowship of the Ring (Chapter 7, Mirror of Galadriel, Book 2 of the Fellowship)

"But death in battle may come to us all yet, willing or unwilling." -Faramir, The Return of the King (Chapter 5, Book 2 of Return of the King)

And in that time also … the Enchanted Isles were set, and all the seas about them were filled with shadows and bewilderment. -The Silmarillion (Chapter 11, Sun+Moon+Hiding of Valinor)

He took his harp and sang a song of Valinor… Thus Fingon found what he sought. -The Silmarillion (Chapter 13, Return of the Noldor)

 

 

 

I don't have a Spanish edition Silmarillion… yet. But I do have my Spanish lotr ao I'll quicly post the translated quotes for that one:

 

1st one: "Creyó ver que en el cielo oriental, muy lejos, aparecía una luz; brillaba y se apagaba, una y otra vez."

2nd: "Al principio nos sentíamos cansados y el peligro estaba aún demasiado cerca; y luego casi olvidamos nuestra pena durante un tiempo, mientras veníamos felices por los hermosos senderos de Lórien" 

3rd: "Pero la muerte en la batalla aún puede alcanzarnos a todos, la deseemos o no."

Edit: hmm, for some reason when I edited my last comment it posted it again… Anyway, this is the correct one.

Hi all!

Now it's finished, the new version 2.4 of the Custom Card Creation plug-in is out, including the capability to create custom treasure cards:
http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/2817/tresurecard.jpg [http://img836.imageshack.us/img836/2817/tresurecard.jpg]

The plug-in is created for Strange Eons v 2.1 alpha 13. I plan to convert the plug-in for SE v 3 in the future ( =definitely not this year), but the current version is only made for SE 2.1 alpha 13.
To install the plug-in, download and double-click the seext file. The old file will be replaced after restarting SE, and you can use the new version.

I like to say thanks to karagh, Gizlivadi and Shiv@n for Spanish and French translations, as well as GeckoTH for the high quality template!

You can download it from 4shared here:
http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html]
or mediafire here:
http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?944f0ra669p550f [http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?944f0ra669p550f]
and presumably also from Svenn's LCG resource page soon:

Nice tool!

One problem that I have found out is that it is very difficult keep up with all these new custom made scenarios and cards because they are all shared in different plases…

I am wondering if we could make one portal or site where anyone can save and upgrade their own custom cards… like google docks for LOTR lcg, or something similar? Now the hunting down all these fabulous cards is full time job…

 

So what would we need for that…

 1. some agreement what would be the platform (data server)
 2. Some one who would the "founder" who would give allowance to those who privide their own cards and scenarios
 3. some serious advertisindg in different plases

 

What information would be needed

Scenario:

 1. author
 2. date
 3. version number
 4. name of scenario
 5. difficultu rating
 6. description of scenario
 7. needed adventure decks

 



I am actually building this right now at LotRLCG.com. It should be done be the end of the year. You will be able to upload, comment on, and rate user scenarios.

Thanks for the new version! The treasure card is noce to have in custom scenarios!

One question though. What upgrades SE v3 will bring, if any? This v2 seems to work guite well actually.

## 81 [HilariousPete on November 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54871-new-plug-in-for-creating-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=725950)

I guess the most changes will be "under the hood" of SE. Chris Jennings wants to move from the model "AH, plus some other special extensions" to a more general framework where AH is an extension like any other game extension. So there will be API changes for me as programmer. I guess for you as users of the LotR plug-in, no dramatic changes will happen. With the transition to SE v 3, I also want to change the distribution of the plug-in (so it can be automatically downloaded through the SE catalogue browser). This will probably be the biggest change for users of my plug-in.

I didn't have the chance to download the AH game extension for SE v 3 (very lame internet here), so I can't say anything definite. But Chris Jennings has been doing an excellent job with SE and I suppose the next version will also be very good and have some improvements. One improvement is already visible for me: The installer exe is not 12, but only 4 MByte big, because the AH extension is not automatically shipped with it (but downloadable through the catalogue). That's nice if you have bad internet access :-)

 Thanks for information! Smaller footprint is allways nice in programs. If there are other improvements too, it seems to be nice!

Hello everyone,

it's been a while since my last update on the LotR CCC plug-in. There is a reason for this. After I finished my studies, I got a job and I'm working into the subject, which takes some time. This time is desperately missing for the plug-in, I haven't been working on it for at least two months. Since I want to concentrate on my job, and my interest in LotR is dwindling (one of the major point is that it is too much battle-focused when compared to e.g. MECCG for my taste - although the majority of people seems to really like that), I decided to give the plug-in in someone elses' hands, hopefully more motivated ones ;-)

I won't prescribe my potential successor what to do with the project - it will be his, then - but the next step's I'd do are inclusion of the encounter set symbols for HoN, soon also for the Hobbit 2, and the migration to SE 3.

Chris Jennings has been doing a pretty good job in writing SE and it is usually well documented, although there will be a lot of documents to work into at first. Of course I'm going to support my successor as good as I can. Such a person should be pretty familiar with at least 1 programming language (it is java / javascript, but that's not so important, I'm not a java programmer myself). Since I use the templates of GeckoTH, no graphics skills are required.

Is anyone of you interested to take over this project?

 

Kind Regards,

Pete

I've run in to a problem on Strange Eons. When I create a hero and then close the program, then open it again, I get this:

 

Uncaught java.lang.IllegalStateException: DIY component properties can only be modified in create(): DIY{script=LotR/hero.js, faceStyle=PLAIN_BACK}
DIY component properties can only be modified in create(): DIY{script=LotR/hero.js, faceStyle=PLAIN_BACK}
at res://LotR/hero.js:67
 
Because of this, I can't edit heroes anymore. I have to completely start over on them if I want to change something. I noticed someone else ran into this earlier in the thread, but I didn't see any replies to it.  
Any advice?

First, make sure you are using Strange Eons 2 to create and load your cards. The plugin is designed for Strange Eons 2, and it might not work properly in Strange Eons 3.

Version 2.51 up: http://www.4shared.com/folder/8_ZiI_xU/StrangeEons2.html [http://www.4shared.com/folder/8_ZiI_xU/StrangeEons2.html]

It's a minor update: I forgot adding the bilbo resource icon tag in 2.5.

 * Rememeber that this plug-in is for STRANGE EONS 2, NOT 3 .
 * You can download the proper program version for your system from the same 4shared Folder. If you use the Windows version, you have to download and install the proper Strange Eons 2.1 Java 7 Update file, if in doubt try first the 64 bit version.

Hey, looking to load this on to a OS X Maverick's running Mac. Is it currently ok to use SE v3 or should we still use v2 of SE?

 

Any other things to look out for when loading onto a Mac?

I don't have OSX, but I think SE3 runs well on OSX because I haven't seen bug reports about OSX on a while. Just check you have instaled latest Java.

 

You should be using SE3 for new cards. The only problem is that you can't load SE2 created cards on SE3 version of the plugin. But there's no problem on having both Strange Eons 2 and 3 on the same computer (I have both on Windows and Linux). I'm working on SE2 cards' support, but it will take some time.

Has anyone successfully put their custom cards onto OCTGN and used them in games? I've followed the few instructions I can find, but there are hardly any, and none of them seen to work.

HilariousPete no longer plays this game and is soly playing Middle Earth CCG 9and some other non-FFG games)... so unless someone else has taken over this plugin I do not think it will ever be updated. Do not worry though as there are still quality PSD templates you can find by a user on the Geek called Gekoth, in fact the plugin was made using his templates. He has done all the template files for Scenarios, Boons, Burdans and even rule instruction sheets. You will need Photoshop to use this though...

I know some people really prefer OCTGN, but the LackeyCCG plugin is as easy to add cards as editing a text file. Just put the custom cards in a directory in the set folder, then add the image name and the card name to the txt file in the folder.. .. bang your done. (open the text file as a tab tab delimitered spredsheet in excell or Calc)

I've created OCTGN sets and used them to the great success.
