I finally got a copy of Conflict At The Carrock (CatC) today and immediately noticed that the included scenario only has two cards and no printed victory conditions.  After speaking to a friend who already had the pack and who frequents these boards, he said it was the "consensus" that this was correct.  I asked him if this had been confirmed by FFG themselves but he didn't know.

So my question is ... has the lack of a third scenario card for CatC been confirmed as correct by FFG or has it just been assumed to be correct by player consensus?  What's the official reason for a lack of visible victory conditions?

 It is correct.

You will also notice you get 60 cards.

 Yeah, I was asking the same question when I got mine...in fact, if you watch this message board over the course of about a month, you will notice your exact same question being posted as a new thread about every week by a new player.  Point is, you aren't alone in wondering, and I think FF was a little vague in the way they chose to write the quest.  Kill the trolls, quest for 1 token and you win!!! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I still haven't beaten this scenario (I play solo 95% of the time). Happy gaming friend!

I did look through a few pages and I did see that it had been asked before but, like my friend said, it was never official.  FFG never replied themselves, it was always other players saying things like "it seems that ... " or "we play it like this ... ".  My point in the OP was about an official response.

And yes, I did think to count the cards which was why I put "missing card" in inverted commas in the title.  :-)

 FFG doesn't really post on these forums.  They read them, but there's not really an official presence here.  If it's an official response you're after, you'd likely be better off submitting a question through the link on the bottom of the home page.
