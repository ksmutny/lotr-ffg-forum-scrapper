"when Conflict at the Carrock releases in Q3 of 2011."

?? I thought they would release one adventure pack a month?!

Q3 starts in July, so it's not that far off. I expect we'll see Hunt for Gollum in July (I hope!) and Carrock in August.

As I posted in the Release Date thread, my Hunt for Gollum pack has been dispatched by Maelstrom Games, so it should be widely available shortly. That should also mean Carrock will be released by the end of July / early August.

 I'll believe it when I see it at the store!
