I wonder...

 

with CARN DUM BEING SO ... oh sorry, wrong topic.

 

Okay, actually kind of related. I recently picked up Mage Wars Academy, and what fun it is to just have access to the cards you want... of course LOTR LCG depends too much on the card draw mechanism and deck, that's okay, but it had me wondering... given the mulligan rule, and given the cooperative nature of the game... would I in fact have more fun (without removing the tension) if I just selected my opening hand?

 

I think so!

 

Given that you can basically could keep playing and playing (or aborting each time) until you DO get the opening hand you want... why not just select it?

Yes, we could tweak it, "select two cards, then draw the next random four"... but to experiment, I'm giving it a go. Full selection of all seven!

 

Against Carn Dum.

 

(if it was any other quest, I'd say select the starting six only)

This subject was actually broached a few months ago. One suggested variant was that for each starting card you select, your starting hand total count is reduced by one. The thread is here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188985-would-fixed-opening-hand-nurture-the-deckbuilding-or-harm-it/] if you're interested.
