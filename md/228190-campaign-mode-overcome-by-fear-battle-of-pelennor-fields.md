Hi guys.

 

So I've been playing through a campaign mode, and I came to an unfortunate set of circumstances:

 

1. During the Paths of the Dead scenario, I ended with Overcome by Fear attached to my dial, because we quested past the Stone of Erech, which is the victory condition for the scenario, but unfortunately, a treachery reattached Overcome By Fear. Therefore, I did not get to the end of the round to fulfill the trigger for the Action to remove it.

 

2. On the Siege of Gondor scenario, it took us 9 turns to complete it. This meant that during the Battle of Pelennor fields, Aragorn will take 9 turns to arrive. I did end WITHOUT Overcome by Fear attached to my dial, but there is no specific instruction to remove it from the campaign pool if it is not attached.

 

3. Because my starting threat is 33 (via an unfortunate circumstance with my friend's utter annihilation earlier in the campaign), Overcome by Fear means I literally cannot survive the 9 turns required for Aragorn to arrive.

 

My questions are as follows:

 

1. Did I miss my opportunity to remove Overcome by Fear during the Paths of the Dead? Is there a brief "End of the Round" when we win the scenario in which I could have triggered the action?

 

2. If I completed Siege of Gondor without Overcome by Fear in play, does it return to the Campaign Pool?

 

3. Is it necessary for Aragorn to arrive in order to defeat the Battle of Pelennor Fields scenario?

 

Thanks guys, stuck in a very frustrating situation, and hoping for some clarity about exactly how screwed I am.

Huh, that's... hmm. That's a tough one. It's not even a Condition, so you can't deal with it that way.

 

You might be forced to switch your heroes to lower threat ones, incurring the threat penalties again. That's unfortunate.

You still get the burden if it ends unattached. You have to control Aragorn to defeat Stage 5, thus the scenario. Just use ally Elfhelm :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

Unfortunately Ally Elfhelm reduces your threat rather the cancels threat gain, so won't do anything to help here. I don't think there are any cards that cancel threat gain rather than reduce it.

I think Authraw has it... Either switch to a Hobbit deck or a 2 hero build, or rewind your campaign and retread the Paths of the Dead...

Alright, thanks guys. Didn't think I'd missed something, but I was hopeful that the round might count as "ending" when you defeat the Paths of the Dead. I'll probably switch down to just a couple heroes and try to stall long enough for Aragorn to come save the day.

Would the following combo allow you to survive?

You're going to need a lot of card draw, but that just might do it. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

If Overcome by Fear is not attached to you dial at the end of the quest, you remove it from the game, you get the burden only if it is attached.

 

What you always get, thaught, are those Wings of Wraith, at the end of quest 3, even if you killed it.
