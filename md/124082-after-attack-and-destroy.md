Hi

 

I played some card with text "After this character attacks and destroy an enemy then an effect triggers". I have a question that dose an effect trigger after the character destroyes an enemy by participate in an battle (dose not attack alone)?

 

Thank

It doesn't matter if this character attacks alone or he participates in other attack. The effect is the same.
