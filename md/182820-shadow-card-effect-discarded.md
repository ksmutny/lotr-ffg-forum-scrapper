# [Shadow card effect (discarded)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182820-shadow-card-effect-discarded/)

I always play that way but after I talk to some players here I understood some people play it differently.. So I would like to clean some points.

If enemy shadow card effect say: enemy get +3 attack and I manage to discard this card (Gandalf staff for example) not cancel a shadow effect , just discard shadow card after the shadow card was revealed. So in this case enemy lose +3 attack bonus since shadow card not in play amymore right?

My interpretation matches yours

I think we had a thread fairly recently that said no, the effect needs to be canceled right at that moment.  

 

Simply discarding it after the effect has been resolved won't cancel the effect.  So you couldn't, say, use Gandalf's Staff to remove that 3 attack after you've flipped the card over.

 

Also important because some shadow effects say something like "enemy gets +1 attack until the end of the round." If that enemy is able to make an additional attack, you will discard the +1 attack shadow card before you deal another shadow card for the next attack.  However, that +3 attack remains active even though the shadow card was discarded.  

 

I'll see if I can dig up that thread...

bottom line: treat shadow cards like EVENTS, not like ATTACHMENTS.  Attachments only work when they're in play.  Events get resolved and then discarded, but discarding them doesn't cancel the effect.

Do you have an example of such a shadow effect?

 

For enemies that make additional attacks, I've only counted shadow effects that resolve during that specific attack, and not previous ones.

Yeah if it just says "Enemy gets +1 attack" that will only last until the current attack is resolved.  But if it has a phrase like "until th end of the phase" it'll apply to any additional attacks that enemy makes as well (or when you make attacks of your own):

 

Here's a card like that:

Interesting, so without me being familiar with the Gandalf Staff card, what use is it exactly if it discards a shadow card but the effect of the shadow happens anyway? Is there a situation where discarding it is worth doing? Genuinely interested :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Edit:Aha the bgg thread explains it well, the difference between discarding and cancelling. Makes sence now thanks!

You just have to use Gandalf's Staff before you reveal the shadow card.  So there is a good chance it will whiff.

... so it's better to use Gandalf's staff before revealing the shadow card, am I understanding it correctly?

It's the only way to use it, if shadow cancellation is your goal.

Ok cool! Now game is more difficult then before and is perfectly fine for me. Thanks for clarifying that.

So the main point is Shadow efect working as event. So you need to discard shadow card before it flips on. Good!

> <examples>

 

Thanks. I guess the shadow cards that add lasting effects are few enough that there has rarely been an occasion where they stacked with additional attacks, but it it is good to know that I should look out for them.

 

And it may be my playstyle, but I am always greedy and find myself using the staff for resources/cards in the planning phase, so the point about using it to discard shadows is moot for me.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Hero Gandalf's ability also allows him to play Bunring Brand in himself.  ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]
