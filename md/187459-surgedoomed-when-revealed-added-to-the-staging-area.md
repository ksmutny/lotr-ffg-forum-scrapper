# [Surge/Doomed, When Revealed, Added to the Staging Area](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187459-surgedoomed-when-revealed-added-to-the-staging-area/)

So if card is revealed during setup Surge and Doomed have full effect, but what if they are just added to staging area from discard pile?

I have looked for answer but only got questions about setup.

In the rule book it says about Doomed and Surge that the keyword triggers when the card "is revealed during the staging step of the quest phase or in setup". So if you're still in the staging step I assume they would trigger, but otherwise not.

Surge and Doomed only trigger if a card is revealed, not if it is merely added.

So if i got Lost in the City during Peril in Pelagir adding City Street is not a bad idea?

Not a bad idea at all.  

 

In general, if I'm told to search for a card of type X and add it to the staging area, one of the first things I look for the eligible cards are ones with "when revealed" triggers that I would prefer to avoid having go off - and both doomed and surge fit in that category.

In the current cycle many of the fetch effects make you 'reveal' the card and not just 'add' it, so watch out!
