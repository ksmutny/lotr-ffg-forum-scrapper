I think this is on par and in many ways is better than Cardboard of the Rings. They are trying to do something a bit different with this one focusing on the lore of the game, but they still go though a lot of techy stuff.

I find the guys on this show to be that great mix of passionate, knowledgeable and humble. What I mean by humble is that you will not hear blanket statments on how crap a card is and how you are a moron if you run it when it is in fact one of the best cards in the sphere like you have heard at least 3 times in CoTR, causing retractions in next episode :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The guys at FsotC seam to be more relaxed and chatty, focusing on Lore and sound like they are exploring the game themselves with us, rather than trying to project an air of being exerts and "telling" us what is up. It is subtle, but I think it gives the entire show a very different vibe. A good vibe.

If that isn't enough to get you listening, they are also running a competition for a free copy of Kaz... all you have to do is like their Facebook or chat in there comments page on their site - thefellowshipofthecards.com/ [http://thefellowshipofthecards.com/]
 

Anyway, I also give this show the stamp of awesomeness!! Check it out.. you will not be sorry.

I am a huge fan of both shows and have been listening to both since their first episodes.  Wouldn't say one is better than the other cause they are two way different shows.  But I recommend both of them to everyone!  Both are equally awesome and insightful!

What? That's the best part ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] "Steward of Gondor is crazy good--no, wait, it's terrible--er, it's ridiculously powerful!" Honestly, though, they're both great podcasts that occupy decidedly different niches. As a player who enjoys both thematic gameplay and the art of efficient deck-building, I find each cast brings something worthwhile to the table.

 I've listened to the first three, and I plan on listening to the newer ones when I find the time =P.  But yeah, it is a wonderful podcast, and it truly seems like the guys are having a good time with the cards and the game.  Keep up the great work guys, we listeners love it corazon.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/corazon.gif].

Wow. Thanks, guys, for the kind words! It's great to know that people listing to the podcast are getting what they want out of it.

Just wanted to note that Episode 7 is now up. It includes a very interesting discussion of the most thematic cards in the Core Set and Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. Between this and the new CotR offering, there's a bunch of podcasty goodness awaiting your attention.

to be honest i listened to one of the first cardboardoftherings podcasts and what put me off listening further was that it appeared to me that they hadnt read any of tolkeins books (im not meaning this in a nasty way, there just seemed to be some confusion about who characters/ events were and that the knowledge was brought from the films)  and that it was more about 'the game as a game itself' rather than about the subject of the game. (of course this may be different now as apposed to several months ago, and it could have been coming across wrong to me)

while that may appeal greatly to some, to me not so much, so ill give this one a go.

I would even listen to these guys if they were talking about A game of Thrones, Lego Star Wars Adventure or Peanut Butter Jelly Time. Its fantastic really. 

Ive got this in my earplugs while on my way to / off work. Most of the time I probably look like a retard cause Im chuckling over their commentaries but I really dont give a shyt. Couldnt spend the time better.

New eps our out.. not sure why these guys do not pimp their cast more like the CoTR guys.. it is easily as good if not better imo. I think there has been 2 new  eps from the last time this thread was on top.
