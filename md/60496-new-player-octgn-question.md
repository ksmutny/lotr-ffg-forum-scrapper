 Just started playing this game and got all set up on OCTGN. When I load my encounter deck, it has the Ring logo on it instead of the Sauron Eye, is that supposed to happen or did I miss downloading something? Everything else seems to work fine.

Yeah, it's the encounter deck.  They only have one image specified as the back for everything.  It works great, though.  I just wish you could save games.

What does Lackey mean?  Is it different virtual game table?
