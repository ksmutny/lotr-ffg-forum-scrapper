# [Yet another deck builder?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203064-yet-another-deck-builder/)

## 1 [neutrino_pk on February 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203064-yet-another-deck-builder/?do=findComment&comment=2060733)

Hi

 

I'm considering creating another deck builder for this great game. I just recently got back to playing it and I'm not quite satisfied with deck builders I can find online. It would be similar in functionality to (and based on the same code) http://www.conquestdb.com/ [http://www.conquestdb.com/], possibly with a quest log. 

 

What I'm wondering is if it is still needed five years after release of the game. How is the game doing? How is the community doing? I just don't know if its  worth that amount of time investment.

What is that doesn't satisfies you with the deckbuilders around? I use cardgamedb and it perfectly suits me. Mostly :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Alternative questlog please. A friendly person who can implement features to the log and the builder on the fly. That would be very nice.

 

For example a questlog with campaign logging.

Their look and feel is like 1995? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] (just a personal opinion)

So it's just about aesthetics?

I use http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/ [http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/]The Rivendell Councilroom. 

 

Not at all a fan of the new "suggested cards" feature but it's otherwise perfect for my needs.

FYI, you can turn the suggestion off, if you want.

Only once it has a suggestion. Before that it messes up the frames, especially on my small laptop. Very annoying.

You can blame me for that feature. I find it greatly speeds up my deckbuilding as I only ever have to search for 2 or 3 cards. FYI, if you choose any hero, it will give a suggestion. So you could just pick a hero first and hide the suggestions right from the start. Alternatively, if you are a little tech savvy, you could just download a previous version of the deckbuilder from github and run it locally on your computer.

Is this [http://seastan.github.io/] what you are looking for? It does have a quest log. It's fully functional at the moment but hasn't gone through rigorous bug testing, and there are several features I'm still actively working on. Let me know if you think it's lacking something.

Is it possible to delete quests? I logged one just to test, and now I want to delete it :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

I'm very excited for your tool Seastan. I'll start using it regularly as soon as you remove those data loss warnings. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Done!

Seastan, when using your builder on my computer the "number of copies of a card" option appears on two lines; so it's 0/1/2 and then 3 on a separate line, which looks kind of awkward. Is this an issue with my screen size or something or can you fix it? Rivendell Councilroom works fine for me, where each card only gets one line. Looks much cleaner that way.

He says "shameless", but he's still being modest: just a few days into its life, RingsDB is already an awesome adaptation of the NetrunnerDB code to our game here. Lots of decks already publicly uploaded too, if you need ideas for your own. (I think I may start uploading some of my older ones to help out those with limited card pools. I saw Seastan put up his single-core deck, for example.)

Yeah, ringsdb is great.  I just discovered it this weekend and based on my limited experience with it, I have to say I think it is the best out there.  The only downside is it is considered to be "Games" according to my work filter while most of the others are not. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

Not that I would use such tools at work of course...

I probably waste a good hour of my work day every day on Hall of Beorn or Tales of the Cards. Or watching play-throughs on youTube.

Or at least you admit to an hour wasted...  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Shh! They'll hear you :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

I really liked ringsdb because I was able to find a deck that had minimal conflicts with my staple decks without much trouble.  I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but just having another option will be great when I'm trying to play with play groups.  The only conflict was Daeron's Runes (which is always a conflict and I just use a proxy for it in 3/4 of my decks lol).

I think this is a screen size issue, but I will look into it.

I was having this problem too a while ago, but it seems to be resolved for me lately.

Same here, it seems to be working just fine now.
