Interesting. Id probably just make it an event, though.

I expect we'll see Quickbeam, a powerful Ent ally who does not enter play exhausted. (But is unique of course.)

What we need is a Ranger pipe!

How about:

2 Cost Lore Attachment

 

Attach to a Ranger Character

 

Planning Action: Exhaust Ranger pipe to either look at the top card of the encounter deck or reduce your threat by 1. (Limit once per round).

Hmm. I'm not sure if that's too powerful or not...

It should be limit 1 per character. It should be limited to heroes. And that last line in parenthesis is pointless because the attachment is exhausted... unless you're considering pipe weed.
