hi all just got into this and really enjoying the co-op environment.  I just finished the core scenarios last two took a bit to beat.  Any recommendations on next?  Is it good to start with the Hobbit Sagas or the Mirkwood cycle?

 

Thanks!

Both are OK. Do not start with Heirs of Numenor and beyond because there rhe game becomes more difficult.

This is the rules section ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]  So according to the rules - you would go to the Dwarrowdelf cycle next, starting Khazad-dum deluxe expansion.

??? What makes you say that?

 

The Mirkwood cycle was released before Khazad-Dum and the Hobbit sagas.

 

I've been playing by order of release (exception: haven't played the LotR saga quests yet, waiting to play all 6 sets back to back once they've all been released), and that's my preference. I like to follow the sequential evolution of the game and card pool... and yeah, that's not a rule. Others may have differing opinions.

 

I'm currently half way through the Ringmaker cycle, if that helps the OP at all in his decision making.

Oh, you're right, I was confused.  I thought he meant he finished the "core set quests" meaning Mirkwood cycle, but I think you're right and he means he finished just the 3 core set quests, in which case yes, Mirkwood cycle is next.

If it is between Mirkwood Cyle and Hobbit Saga, then I'd take Mirkwood for the quests. But Over and Under Hill for player cards. :/
