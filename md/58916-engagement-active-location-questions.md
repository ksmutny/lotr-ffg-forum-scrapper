New to the game and I have a basic question(actually two)....

1.When an enemy engages you, and neither it or are your heroes are killed through combat, does that enemy stay engaged with you into the next turn?(or does it return to the staging area?)

2.If you select a location as the active location during the travel phase...does it stay the active location until it is defeated(explored) or does it return to the staging area before the next turn?
