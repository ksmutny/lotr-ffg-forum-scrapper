Hello everyone!

 

I'm new to the forums here so I apologize in advance if this question has been addressed elsewhere or if this is the wrong place to start a thread.  I have a very basic question.  I just bought the Lord of the Rings Card Game and I'm looking at the many choices available for card protection.  What do you all recommend?  Should I keep each individual card wrapped or are there any good deck holders (or something like that) that you all would recommend?

 

Thanks in advance for your help!

I recommend using penny sleeves ( like these: http://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-Card-Premium-Sleeves/dp/B0002TT3NE/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1388506146&sr=1-1&keywords=ultra+pro+penny+sleeves [http://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Pro-Card-Premium-Sleeves/dp/B0002TT3NE/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1388506146&sr=1-1&keywords=ultra+pro+penny+sleeves]) and keep the stuff in the box. They are 1$ per 100 sleeves.

Once you make your mind on buying more cards, there are some posts in the forums discussing this matter. Use the search function for them.

I keep all the Encounter cards sleeved in the box, and the player cards in binders.
