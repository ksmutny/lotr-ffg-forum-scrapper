I have the core set and am playing with only pure (single - shere if influnce) decks at the monent but am being hammered. Will start mix sphere next. I have the core set as stated but also have several adventure packs and Expansions. I love the theme and the game from the early days.

But I am asking do I store the cards in 9 holders to a card page sleeves or do I have to keep the cards separate in the adventure packs and therefor I am better storing them in the packs they came. Can I put all heroes in one to two pages ofÂ  cards pageand then all cards from one sphere from all adventure packs / Expansions, so if I am created a deck I can draw from all cards possible?

The player cards should be sorted by sphere. You don't need to sort them by adventure, as they can be used in any of them.
