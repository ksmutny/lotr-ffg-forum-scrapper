I keep seeing people saying "Leadershit" instead of "Leadership". Is this on purpose or is there some weird autocorrect thing going on? MyNeighborTrololo seems to do it every time.

I do not know, but this is the image I get in my head whenever I read it:

So is it deliberate? Solve the mystery for us.

> Yup.

Why don't you like it? Unless you've already said somewhere else, then just direct me.

Doesn't means I don't like it. Just means I have a special relationship with it.
