On quest 2b of Passage through Mirkwood playing with two decks. During the quest phase I exhausted several heroes and allies two of which were Lorien Guide. Since I commited both of them to the quest I got to place 2 progress tokens on 2b which completed it. Do I remove quest 2b right then and flip over 3a and resolve the "when revealed" portion or do I resolve the questing phase first and then flip to the next card in the quest deck after that?

 

Thanks in advance for your help

You immediatly remove 2b and flip over 3a, resolving its when revealed effect.

Lorien Guide can only place progress tokens on the Active Location, never on the quest card.  So you cannot place 2 progress tokens on 2b quest card.
