Does Elfhelm's Response apply to the threat increase from the Gollum Objective card at the end of each round (i.e. does it reduce it from an increase of 3 to 2)?  I read the core rule book and it wasn't clear to me if Objective cards were considered Encounter Cards.  On page 6 of the English core rule book it states, "An encounter deck consists of Enemy, Location and Treachery cards."  It does not mention Objective Cards.  Later on when describing Objective Cards it states, "Unless otherwise specified, objective cards are shuffled into the encounter deck when setting up a scenario."

Since Gollum is never shuffled into the encounter deck is he considered an Encounter Card?  Obviously, Elfhelm being able to reduce this recurring threat increase by 1 will have a significant impact on the quest, especially when playing solo.

Looks like Elhelm will not help in my opinion.

I'd say that objective cards are encounter cards, too. On p. 3 the rulebook lists 84 encounter cards. You only get to this number when you include the objectives, otherwise the core set only had 81 encounter cards. I bet FFG just forgot to include the objectives in the list on page 6. Or they planned to deal with the description of the objectives later on p.7 because not in every case the objectives start in the encounter deck (e.g. the 3 starting objectives in EfDG).

If that's true, Elfhelm will help against Gollum.

 Since they included elf helm in the same ap as this gollum objective, didn't they probably do that so we'd use him against having to raise our threat so much?  BTW, if you don't use elf helm you raise your threat by 3 + the normal 1= 4.

He dose not affect the threat gain at the turn. So the player with gollum gets 4 threat a turn, witch is why it is so important to move him around. Still, imo, gollum is NOT part of the encounter deck.. he is not even drawn form the deck, he is placed out of it at the start. This is one for a FFG question submition... but imo.. he will not help gollum's effect

It is good that you are submitting rules question t o FFG. Right now I would say that elfhelm ability works. Gollum card back is the same as the rest of encounter deck.

ME - Dose the effect on "Elfhelm" remove a 1 threat gain from the "Gollum" card in Return to Mirkwood? Is "Gollum" part of the encounter deck, as it is not ever IN the deck, or revealed from it? Elfhe lm's ting is "Response: After your threat is raised as the result of questing unsuccessfully, or by an encounter or quest card effect, reduce your threat by 1."... but is Gollum a "encounter" card?

NATE - Objective cards are considered encounter cards, whether they actually get shuffled into the encounter deck or not.
