 Quick question: I was just putting together a Lore/Tactics deck to play Journey down the Anduin, and I got wondering: when you're trying to stick to a 50 card deck size, do you count your 3 heros as part of that number?

No you don't. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] They are not included.

 Ok, thanks! That makes a lot more sense
