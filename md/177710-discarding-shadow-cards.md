Are shadow cards only discarded at the end of the combat phase? If an enemy gets dealt one during the refresh phase, it would stay there until the next round's combat phase, correct?

I cannot really recall what would deal a shadow card in the refresh phase but it should stay there until the end of the next combat phase or after the enemy has made an out-of-order attack; whichever comes first.

Sorry, I was on my phone and couldn't elaborate for those curious. It was indeed that very combo.
