I can guess somone has asked about this before but…
By a two handed solo. Are you all using two separate decks and playing as both players or am i missing somehting?

Exacty so. It lets you use more of those cards you bought & also smooths the difficulty curve (in terms of the scenarios - it is slightly more laborious). I started this way but have switched to solo now for the time being but I miss having asmaller pool of viable cards.

I can't pretend to understand how a smaller pool is comforting xD thank you for the responce.
On that same note, then i should play as if there were two players for card effects right?

yes- this is a coop game so it makes no difference if you 'play' both players as hands are open across the table. i switched from solo to this and prefer it

give it a go, i reccomend it
