I don't know if you are aware of the LOTR companion : http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/home.html [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/home.html] . It is pretty useful but it recently try to use the contact form but the mail address seem to be wrong. Does anyone know how I can let them a message?Â  Thanks.
