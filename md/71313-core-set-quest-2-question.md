 To the river… reveals 1 card from top encounter deck and add it to the staging area. What if its not an enemy card? Shall i just drop it into the discard pile? Thank you.

hello

'add to staging area' means resolve as well as….so if its an enemy/location add it, if its a treachery then resolve its when revealed effect

Thank you. May i have some more advice pls? My other questions are:

1. I am now playing with Octgn(An CCG/LCG/BG emulator). Is this legal? Did i  offend the privacy of FFG?

2. I am thinking about buying the real game but for 3/4 players the tokens and cards seems not enough to play with, since buying two core sets is kinda waste of       money since we dont need 2 copies of heroes and quest cards. FFG doesnt sell tokens separately which is quite upsetting to me. Amazon doesnt have that type of counters.

3. Which large expansion is a must have?I d like to buy a core set plus a large expansion because the small/regular expansion is not a good deal ($10 for only 60 cards while a large on comes with more stuffs in it).

of course

1. i have no idea here but alot of people play this, and i believe that they have to wait so long before uploading new packs…but im really not sure

2. yes it is a shame and its also annoying there isnt 3 copies of each card in the set- this is something that often gets complained about, but there is not counters, singles, tokens etc being sold that i know of- best thing is try to get one second hand

3.another problem here is that many of the must have cards are spaced out in the packs- which is obviously a good selling technique on fggs behalf.

you have 2 options at the moment, khazad dum and the hobbit saga pack 1. the hobbit pack will be incredibly diffiuclt with just a core set and nothing else, and khazad dum will also be very difficult, but not as much as the hobbit.

if you are going for 1 go for khazad. however cards like the song cards that are really key are spaced out in the mirkwood cycle.

remember that you need to buy khazad dum pack for the following 6 dwarrowdelf chapter packs, however the core set will do for the mirkwood cycle

anything else just ask happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]
