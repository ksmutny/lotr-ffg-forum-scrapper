From the news: www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3405]

Unluckily I'm from Italy so bye-bye event… I think this will be sold in the future as print on demand.

Nice! Yeah, I'm very excited about this. I probably won't make it to Gencon either, but I'm assuming as well that this will be available as a print on demand afterwards like the Massing at Osigiliath one.

the title sounds quite good -- the battle of lake town.

it sounds like it might be another super tough fight, like the massing at osgiliath

I don't see it in the GenCon site, maybe it's there and I am blind, but anyways one member of the spanish forum has put the description of this quest:

"Smaug has awakened! During the night of terror that faces you, the fate of Esgaroth is in your hands. Not only will you have to slay the mighty dragon himself, but Lake-town is burning down around you. If the fires get out of control, none will survive! Test your team's skill against an exclusive new Quest at our inaugural Fellowship Event! You must bring your own LotR LCG deck to participate. All participating players will receive one free copy of 'The Battle of Lake-town' Quest. Players must participate in this event as part of a 2-player team. Each member of your team must register for the event."

Greetings.

Great !!! However I tought that this scenario would have been in the second hobbit expansion…

While the battle happened during the hobbit, it didn't directly involve Bilbo etc.  So it makes a good stand alone tie in for the Sage expansion.

Yeah, but it's most surprising one of the most significant episode of the Hobbit shall not be in the Hobbit? Or shall it still? Puzzled.

I am very excited about this one….. really hope it goes print on demand for us poor non-americans!

 

 As for where it stands- there was a lot more than 1 battle with smaug at laketown. This may be a fight smaug off style scenario as opposed to a kill smaug style scenario!

However Bilbo was not involved in the burning of Laketown. They may try to keep the Hobbit Saga expansion focused on Bilbo and so not include this event.

If so I think that's a great idea and it's cool that the PoD scenario is tied into the current releases thematically and not so "stand alone" as Osgiliath was.

However, wouldn't it be strange to "slay the Dragon" now, only later to begin a dragon-slaying quest?

Maybe they will make it work so it shall make sense, I wonder.

so does this mean that its only a 2 player quest? or is that part of the gencon rules?

Pfft, come on, that was all Bilbo's fault for taunting Smaug demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] .

I think this is because they want to optimize the table space not because of the special rules in the scenario (pure speculation)

I agree that it will probably be a quest similar to Massing.  Probably a print on demand at some point. 

I was really hoping that the Saga edition would be released at GenCon, but with Shadow coming in "a few weeks" and new of the Laketown quest, I am having some doubts. 

With this announcement, I now have a decision since Dust Tactics Nationals are at the same time.  Bummer

 Yay! Just got my ticket for the 1pm session. Looking forward to this! I guess i'll avoid putting Burning Brands in my deck

Between this and missing the new Netrunner that is coming out, I am disappointed that I will not be attending. Hopefully there are some events that will be equally enticing next year.
