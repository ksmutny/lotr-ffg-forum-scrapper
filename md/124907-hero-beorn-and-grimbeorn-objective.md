Are these two cards supposed to be the same were-bear (I was fancying using Beorn as a hero but I don't want to have to rotate in some other hero when I play CatC).

Grimbeorn also known as Grimbeorn the Old was Beorn's son. Like his father, he could turn into the shape of a bear, and he lived in the same regions as his father had in the Vales of Anduin. He took over as chieftain of the Beornings after his father's death. As chieftain, he kept the High Pass and the Ford of Carrock free from orcs and wolves, though Glóin commented to Frodo Baggins that his "tolls are high" and he was "not over fond of dwarves." He was the chieftain of many stout Men and had some military power in the Vales of Anduin.

Thanks, I'm notoriously not so knowledgable about the more obscure bits of Tolkien lore.
