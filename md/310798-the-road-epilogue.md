The Quest has failed. Frodo has claimed the Ruling Ring and set forth his will against that of Sauron. But there can only ever be one Lord of the Ring. Here is the very last piece of writing for the Saga, wrapping up the narrative of our campaign. Thank you so much for reading along, I hope you have enjoyed the journey as much as I have.

Aure Entuluva!
