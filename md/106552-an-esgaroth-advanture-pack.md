So, somewhere in discussion about underdeveloped and not developed at all traits, someone

mentioned Esgaroth trait. So, here I present you another of my brainfarts, an Advanture Pack worth of player cards, dedicated to the Esgaroth and it's essential inhabitants - the Craftsmen.

Wow fantastically done. I normally don't give custom cards the time if day but you did a fantastic job capturing a unique feel for a trait and creating some very useful cards that are well balanced (well the fisherman and hired blade might be OP if I had to nitpick). The toll gate in particular had just a great and appropriate mechanic

Given the opportunity I would like to see your creation of a hero for this "AP worth of cards" to tie it all together. Maybe even the master who whomever your inspiration inclines you to make

> Thanks a bunch. Can you elaborate about Fisherman and Hired Blade being OP?

Fisherman is fine, I misinterpreted his ability on my first read thru and missed the part about him returning to your hand so I was incorrectly under the impression that he could just create a free resource each turn (which he still technically can do but it wouldn't net you anything ((no pun intended)) since you would have to pay for him each time) The hired blade still seems quite good; comparing him to the most comparable example now is the vassal of the wind lord which has worse stats and must leave play after one turn. Paying a resource to keep him isn't the hardest thing in the world to do especially if you splash leadership. You also don't even necessarily need to spend the resource each turn either. He can be dropped as a cheap chump if necessary or to just polish off a big enemy. I use the term OP liberally so he may not be that but I think he would instantly be a staple in decks using tactics

The reason why I didn't created a hero is because I know no named prominent persons from Esgaroth besides Bard.

I have to agree about the hired blade and fisherman. I feel that hired blade. Should cost 2, but I'm really not sure. I'm not 100%.

I think fisherman is definitely too cheap or something. After you quest and win by 4, or after a location is explored maybe, because he isn't unique you could have +3 resources a turn. Plus he is neutral. I get the card though, don't get me wrong, a killable, cheap neutral resource generator. Good idea.

EDIT: Sorry I'm super tired, I also missed the back to your hand bit.

Also I didn't mean to seem so negative, the merchant craftsman theme is awesome. I really like the overall feel and searching abilities. Again, great job at your custom content.

Well done. Fisherman and Toll Gate are especially cool ideas. Not sure if I'd choose the same card costs for some cards, but nevermind. There's a typo on Hired Blade btw.

 

Thanks for sharing! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Going deep into my reasoning behind Hired Blade:

The main contestant is Vassal of the Windlord, yes. Vassal is a great card and I love to use him. His main advantage over Hired Blade is being ranged. Leaving play and being an Eagle has some advantages too, if you delve into this stuff.

Another obvious contestand is Knight of Minas Tirith. He costs 2 more, but will attack for free until death do us part, can drag down a potentially nasty foe from the staging area, reducing the thread and even possibly killing him, saving you the trouble of defending. He can be bumped up to 4 attack by Boromir.

Hired Blade will cost you a resource per turn, draining you dry if you're will not co-operate with Leadershit. He has little direct synergy with other cards. Increasing his cost or reducing his attack will make him less favorable than generic 2-3 cost attacker allies in my eyes. He also can get exhausted by a treachery or something else, wasting your time and resources.

A little update: I did some research and designed a hero to fit this "pack".

 

Also, thanks for pointing out the typo, while I was fixing it, I came up with some interesting balance fix for the Hired Blade.

Very nice cards, I enjoyed them a lot. I like the ability on the Master, how he gets very powerful with more resources but can die if you give him to much. Nice.

Thematically, he doesn't die, he gets overgreedy and runs away with all the treausures :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

...like he did according to the history of Esgaroth. So keep an eye on him.

Okay. My first thought when refreshing the thread was "how could I miss the hero?!?" :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

I mostly like these cards.

 

Aspiring Alchemist: is really nicely costed for it's ability and power. Maybe it should be cost 4 because it's in leadership (but I think you already factored that in at 3)

 

Toll Gate: I like the idea of this card although thematically charging Orcs for entry to your quest seems a little odd. I can't think how to make it neater without making it keyed to a trait in the encounter deck (which I know you dislike - in any case there is no such neat trait for humans). It's probably as good as it ever will be because of that. It's a nice idea.

 

Master Blacksmith: I really like the idea, I wonder if the cost is a bit too low though (his stats are okay on a cost 2, and he can put a weapon or Armour attachment into play, the cost of which range from 1-4). On the other hand he's awful to play at cost 3 without a weapon or armor attachment in hand so maybe that is sufficient balance, I would probably make him weapon or armour (not both) or cost 4.

A day at the market: this is my favorite card, I wouldn't change anything.

 

Travelling Artificer; This is the card I like the least, thematically the idea of an artificer in lord of the rings seems out of place (especially a travelling one). I think that the "search for an artifact card" would need to be to do with ancient lore. I personally would make it a "secret knowledge type card, in lore with a doom and cost).

I think the effect of searching for an artifact is so good in the decks that need them (mainly Elrond/Galadriel but Aragon too), that it can't be cost 1 on the back of an ally that also is good (people will pay 2 for a 2 willpower ally without anything as they do with westfold traveller which is a just worse ally than this).

I like the picture, and the idea of searching for an artifact but this card is too strong.

Too busy to rest: I like this card. I might suggest renaming it to "Endless toil" but it doesn't need that. Nothing needs changing.

Hired blade: He's too cheap for how good he is. I would change it to cost 2, and make it hired blade is discarded at the start of the refresh phase unless you pay 1 resource. I'd also add the mercenary trait (along with warrior and Esgaroth) because mercenary would be good trait to add to the game. 

I think his stats are still too good even at cost 2 and would either look at reducing them a little (or a lot if you want to keep him cost 1) I quite like the idea of him costing 1 every time you use him - you might be able to get way with 0/3/0/1 for cost 1 (with the pay 1 or discard him rule) I think his starts are just far too nice even for a cost of 1 a turn currently.

I do like the pay to refresh him idea though, just needs the numbers tweaking. 


Hardened: I'd make it cost 1 (it's supreme benefit is that it gets you an additional +1 without being restricted, it would still see play at cost 1). Personally I'd change the name to "forged" but hardened works.

Fisherman: I like this card (second favorite card out of these) it's a nice idea, I wouldn't change him at all.

Aspiring Alchemist was originally 2, then I have it a thought and gave her well deserved 3. To cost 4, she'll need a better stat block. The main point is that you need a situation to call upon her - a wounded character, a nasty condition in play or somebody who needs a little bit of bulking up, so you'll keep her in your hand until you have the opportunity.

 

Note that Master Blacksmith is being exhausted if you play him with his response triggered.

 

As for Travelling Artificer, I'm no dabbler of LotR lore, I was just assuming there could be something like this going on in the trade town like Esgaroth, having so many people(elves and dwarfs) to trade with. I'll consider doing something with her.

 

The Stats of Hired Blade are storng, yes, but as expensive his service in the long term. I've already bumped him to 2 with a little trick. I was considering reducing his health and defense, but willpower - really? Will somebody spend a resource to quest for 1? I think I have another interesting idea, but his text box is starting to get bloated...

 

As for Hardened - it's a very specific card. It requires you to have a weapon or armor attached, and you need to have a craftsman in play, which are nonexistent in the tactics sphere. Dam, I think I had forgotten to limit it to 1 per attachment...

I started my post before the update -

The hero seems fine to me, he has a slight stat advantage, on the other hand he does have the risk of being discarded entirely if you stall on things to spend his resources on if you try to utilize it.

I think your hired blade is still too good; the hired blade costs 2, and has an 8 point stat allocation - the best stat allocations for a 3 cost card (that doesn't leave play after one turn) is 7. That's a somewhat crude way of looking at it but; 

The negative of needing to pay 1 to refresh him isn't really a good justification if you compare this card with, watcher of Bruinen or Trollshaw Scout (both of which require you to discard one card or discard it from play - which is a harsher punishment than doesn't ready and arguably a greater cost than 1 resource). Additionally being able to pay 1 on him is beneifical to the new hero (which is nice synergy, but does make this card even better).

Getting a 3 in attack is pretty big in general. Vassal of the winglord gets a 3 for cost 1  with an automatic discard and a stat allocation of 4, this guy is basically a winglord that stays in play every turn you choose not to pay for him, that can also quest for 1 and defend for 2 with 2 hitpoints. (Even at cost 2 he's just better).

Getting 1 willpower as a tactics ally at cost 1 or 2; will make him an auto-include for tactics. They don't get +1 willpower until cost 3 (Or Guthlaf with Rohan - but he has no special rule without also having a gondor hero, even then he only gets sentinel and a bad stat array). 

I would seriously be considering cost 3 and 0 willpower. I think 0 willpower makes thematic sense for a mercenary that isn't a mercenary scout or tracker personally. You could make him cost 2 if you don't keep the ability to lower it with Esgaroth heroes, but I think that it's better at cost 3 with that rule kept.

I accept that Hardened requires you to be dual sphere,and with the limit of 1 per attachment it would become a maximum of +2 attack.

On the other hand, the best weapon in the game (Dwarven axe) is cost 2 for a flat +1 (+2 for dwarfs), followed by dwarrowdwelf axe, which is cost 1 for a flat +1 with a special rule (dwarf only).

This would basically work on any weapon in the game to make it either as good as the best weapon in the game (with + its own extra rules) or make the best weapon potentially +3, which is better than even the treasures from the hobbit saga.

Yes it might sit in your hand as a dead card until you get a craftsman or a weapon - and if you were intending the craftsmen trait to be limited to just these four cards then I would agree that cost 0 is fine. However craftsmen (In lord of the rings) is the kind of trait I would expect to eventually be quite common if it was added. Hence wanting it to be cost 1. 

This card is fine if you never add more craftsmen.

Aspiring Alchemist is fine at cost 3, I was thinking that having access to the flexibility she offers should cost more, but at cost 4 she'd never get played.

Master Blacksmith being exhausted is a nice cost - but I'm still concerned with, essentially the potentially huge resource advantage.  His stats are decent for cost 3 but not great with not special rule. However if you play him and a cost 3 or 4 attachment then you're essentially getting a huge boost of resources and still getting a decent character all for only losing one turn of use with him.

He'd chain too well with master of the forge I feel - You'd either play him for 3 and not exhaust him (if you needed his "okay" stats) or you'd, get a huge resource advantage.

The problem is if you make him cost 4 you lose the resource advantage but then he's only worth playing if you also get a decent attachment out of it, which is probably too restrictive. At cost 3 though it feels like the advantage is a bit too good still. Maybe if you lower his defence..

but then I feel like his stat array is right for a human blacksmith in this game. That's why I suggested making him a weapon or armour smith (rather than both) ...

maybe it's okay for the card to be on the powerful side though...  I think this might be the hardest card to make a call on, it's not super powerful like this, but it's definitely on the powerful side. I do like the idea of this blacksmith card.

I don't think you read my response about hired blade when you wrote your reply (my fault sorry, I didn't see your update until later). I will add though, there's been loads of solo tactics games I've played where I would absolutely pay 1 resource a turn for 1 willpower and it would have made a huge difference.  I often consider using White-tower watchman in solo tactics because I want the willpower rather than the hitpoints.

I think I could have just made it worse, but Travelling Artificer is now Noldor, costs 1 more, exhausts to in addition to spending 1 resource for her ability and searcher only top 10 cards of your deck. And has 1 more health.

 

Hardened is now limited to being 1 per attachment.

 

Hired Blade just lost Sentinel and got some interesting condition which will make keeping him around a bit tricky. And he kept his 1 willpower. I consider willpower not only being tied to the person's strength of will, but also to it's wit. You need to have at least some wit to survive as mercenary in this world, I suppose.

I think she's more believable as a Noldor (the implication of her travelling is that she travels where she needs to for the ancient artifacts, which is a nicer touch) -I think she's much better the way you have her now.

Hired Blade with the extra risk of being discarded if you have no resources is much better, I'm happy for him to keep the +1 willpower with this change. He still works really well with the hero you've created but I think that's a good thing.

Hardened: as I said, if you never add other craftsmen this seems perfectly fine to me.

I think I have an idea how to make her less blunt and more easily accessible, while keeping her balanced. But I'll take those thoughts to the bad, as it's falling too late. Gonna come back to this tomorrow, after the work. Have some stuff in my pocket to start turning this into the deluxe expansion.

Added new leadership ally (he doesn't fits into the main post):

Those cards are The Toll Gate-like, obviously. Just an thoughts on what if Toll Gate was not an unique to it's kind and there was a whole subtype of cards like it.

Warband leader: seems to be fine; definitely playable with the potential to give you a good reward for the cost (but if he hits nothing he's slightly too expensive). Which seems like the right place for him to be. It's a good card I would expect to see something similar from the official developers if they really do develop the warrior trait for allies.

Shifting Bargains: I find this really hard to evaluate. I'm not sure I would ever pay two for this effect (since it requires card discard as well) on the other hand I can think of times when this would be amazing, it's also guaranteed to work every round that you're on that quest card so maybe cost 2 is appropriate. 

 

Watchtower: I really like the effect on this card. I suspect that cost 2 is too cheap for it for an effect you can use every round while on the same quest card though. Yes it's only 1 enemy a turn in single player - but it has the potential to negate two enemies per play (kill 1 with the damage, then the +defence makes it so another does no damage). I'd pay 2 for this on a one use event card so I think the cost is too low. 

It should be at least 3; arguably even 4. (Although at 4 it becomes a card that would be still great for some quests but mostly too expensive for it's effect). I'd make it 3 for play-testing.

Great Celebration: This is one of those cards that I think you've undercosted, but it depends on if the Esgaroth trait was going to get more attention. If Esgaroth was eventually going to be a full trait (I think it will) then this card should be cost 4 at least. If however the trait isn't full (like eagles) then I think it should be cost 2.


In general it's hard to evaluate the value of "attach to the current quest card" we don't currently have any cards of that type from the official game. I'm sure they'll come eventually but I don't know how to cost-balance them. They're better than attachments to locations because the quest will typically stay in play for longer. They're like effects you'll get for some rounds between 1 and 8 or 9 (for some quests).

This makes me feel they should maybe all be 1 cost more in general than those attachments (which would make them cost 2 base, instead of cost 1) - however getting some of these effects for a cost of only 2 over 8 or 9 rounds would be ridiculously good. So they would need a lot of play testing to find the balance of the cost.

I love you idea of attaching cards to the current quest card. There's a lot of give and take with them because they can stick around for a long time, or they can be gone later that round, depending on how well you quest. I think the potential for them to be very short-lived could bring the price down on them a bit, but maybe not. It's also nice because at the moment, nothing can target an attachment that is attached to a quest.

 

I also love Hardened. In one sense, it's nothing new because you could just play one of the Dunedain attachments instead, but this gives you the versatility to put the points where they are needed at the time, but it also has a requirement of another armor/weapon attachment to be in play, so a 1- or 0-cost is pretty good.

 

Great work with most of these cards. You are adding something truly unique to the game with them. Add these to Gizlivadi's Haven cards, and we're looking at a very different game than we're used to.

About targeting, if you were to discard attachments - you'll be discarding those attached to the quest too.

This is probably getting out of hand, but I had a day off and I spent it thinking about this stuff. Many new cards, so quality and balance might(and will) be on the bad side.

 

I did more research, and found out that Esgaroth traded actvely with dwarves...

This expansion works a lot with weapons, armors and attachments in general, but lacked attachments

of its own. Here's some fine pieces of Esgarothian craft:

"The Men of Lake-town traded with Dorwinion (a human realm on the fertile coastal plain on the west shore of the Sea of Rhûn) in a unique way; wine barrels were floated down from Thranduil's caverns in Mirkwood (the Elves were known as copious wine drinkers, as found in the Hobbit) along the Celduin down to Lake-town, where they were redirected to Dorwinion. The wine was then paid for and filled with the necessary goods before being shipped back north, and the cycle of trade resumed once more."

Making unique characters for the Esgorath is challenging indeed, given no information about anybody living there...

Great work trololo!! Really love some of the art and card mechanics. Some cards are awesome and some are really well done and thematic (barrels in the water is fantastic thematically). Not sure if I will actually give these cards a go or not but really enjoying reading and looking at them and this thread. Almost feels like pretend/psuedo spoilers while we wait for real spoilers/the next cards to be released.

Great work Trololo! However, I think that "Great Celebration" is still overpowered. Perhaps if you'd add something like "characters that are exhausted while GC is exhausted cannot be readied during the refresh phase"?(hangover)

Why do you think it's overpowered? It targets a specific trait(and only allies), it discards itself if someone from that trait dies or upon stage completion, it requires you to discard a costy card from your hand(which you could have needed later). This card is basically consists from drawbacks  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

I think it's fine. Discarding a card may not be sufficient cost to ready multiple allies, but since this attachment will stay in play for such a limited time and it's limited to a specific subset of allies, it's pretty balanced. I might make it cost 1 more, but otherwise I think it's fine. I'd say it's practically an auto-include for Esgaroth, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's overpowered. Of course, I'd have to test it out first for a perfect judgment, but that's how I feel right now.

 

I do feel like Grandmaster Blacksmith is kinda in the wrong sphere for his effect (at least the restricted limit increase part), but that might just means that you have to be more creative to include him.

 

I'm also in love with Studded Leather Armor, but it definitely feels like it's the wrong sphere.

I like the idea with the  Grandmaster Blacksmith being able to have 3 restricted attachments.  Cool tinkering around with some of the mechanics in not obvious ways

When I finish everything, I'll assemble an OCTGN set and will give it some test.

 

Well, looking back at the original LotR LCG, there is currently 4 craftsmen in the game: lampwright, shipwright and two blacksmiths. Both blacksmith work with attachments and belong to the Lore sphere, so I don't know why you think Grandmaster does not belongs to this sphere because of his attachment-related ability...

 

Studded Leather Armor is a light protection intent for those going not into the fight directly, but on the scouting or else. So I thought, Spirit would be a decent fit.

Here is little something, before I go to work:

 

A couple of boring allies... But sometimes boredom is necessary:

This fella should provide some so much needed help with questing for Tactcs, even outside of the Esgaroth:

Final attachment of the set:

And some funny events:

HOQmrY1NvIk.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c617120/v617120009/b371/HOQmrY1NvIk.jpg]

 

 

Generally, all that remains to be done is two events, one for Tactics and one for Lore. I am seriously considering making another round of allies though, and some neutral cards too.

Go whole hog (meaning do all the extra events, allies and neutral cards), you've got my support.

What's the idea behind Intriguing Offer? To reuse 'when played from hand' effects?

## 40 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106552-an-esgaroth-advanture-pack/?do=findComment&comment=1094122)

Many things. You could return something exhausted to put into play something ready. You could use something with reduced cost but high printed cost to put into play something with really high cost. Like you can return a Citadel Custodian(which you paid 0 for) to your hand to put Gandalf into play.

 

I think I need to put more thought into this Intriguing Offer.

## 41 [ZanzibarLand on May 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106552-an-esgaroth-advanture-pack/?do=findComment&comment=1094154)

Seems pretty powerful. I think that Custodian and only a few other means will net you a free ally so it might not be overpowered. A very good tale is one method I can think of. What about sneak attack then swapping for a permanent ally, it'll cost 3 and require 2 cards but its doable.

## 42 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106552-an-esgaroth-advanture-pack/?do=findComment&comment=1094158)

This'll be hella load of preparation. But effects seems to be too abusable, I'll prolly change it.

It's only a two card combo and there are combos as useful/powerful in the game already. Sneak Gandalf is the same kind of thing. I don't think it's too powerful, maybe just a little abusable.

## 44 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106552-an-esgaroth-advanture-pack/?do=findComment&comment=1094186)

Sneak Attack Gandalf is bad on it's own, no need to nurture the same kind of stuff, especially within the same sphere.

I think Intriguing Offer is perfectly fine the way it is. There are a lot of powerful combos, but in general, the most powerful combos require too many cards to make them efficient, so it's fine.

I said the Grandmaster might be in the wrong sphere because most restricted attachments are in Tactics, but you're right that his craftsman nature works perfectly with Lore, so I think he should stay there. As for the Studded Leather, the fact that it is armor just screams Tactics to me and I think it's a more powerful defense than you realize. Being able to cancel one damage every round can be immensely powerful, even at the cost of discarding a card, especially since they have more HP too. Granted, it's not a cost people can generally pay every round unless they have a huge load of card draw, but it works great for cancelling Archery damage or for using on a hero with somewhat lower defense, so they can essentially have 1 more defense. ... although, it also works great for treachery cards that damage questing/exhausted heroes, so it still kinda fits in Spirit, but so far, all armor is in Tactics: http://www.hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?CardType=None&CardSet=Any&Trait=Armor.&Keyword=Any&Cost=-1&Sphere=None&Unique=False&Sort=None&Random=False [http://www.hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?CardType=None&CardSet=Any&Trait=Armor.&Keyword=Any&Cost=-1&Sphere=None&Unique=False&Sort=None&Random=False]

The defence against archery and treachery direct damage is something I didn't think of, but which is really powerful. If this was official I would definitely include it in a lot of decks.

Note that all those armors are heavy as hell. Having a couple of armors outside of tactics is a nice change of pace from my perspective.

> I'm 4 events short of finishing. I'll get things done and then will try it out. Nothing is set in stone, things could easily change dramatically.

 

I haven't been able to keep up with all your card releases (but I feel there's a massive trend towards them becoming more overpowered and less balanced). At this point I will wait for you to finish and then evaluate the set as a whole.

I know you will need to change Survivor of Smaug a lot. a 0 cost 1 willpower ally would be played without any other rules in the tactics sphere. A 2 cost +3 wlllpower (and then +1 willpower a turn ally) is just even better.  A 2 cost chump defender that can also give +1/2 attack to help you counter the enemy you chump defended is also stupidly good - combining these effects into a single card with no opportunity cost for the flexibility is ridiculous. She also gives you an incredibly cheap way to power many of your exhaust esgaroth cards.

She's ridiculously good currently. 

People of Esgaroth is a nice idea for a card, but did you intend for it to become silvan or dwarf? (your envoy cards would mean that it could). I think he should have willpower 1, on the other hand 0 hitpoints without another ally in play is kind of bad. So i would want to test this more, I feel he's a bit too good with the ability to defend without exhausting. 

## 53 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106552-an-esgaroth-advanture-pack/?do=findComment&comment=1095180)

Survivor of Smaug cannot attack or defend, can she?

 

Yes, I did. They will get whatever trait the townsfolk currently have. Not that it will help them much though, but still nice.

 

Ability to defend without exhausting comes in a pair with 0 base hit points and 0 base defense. Mind that damage sticks, and if they get damaged and some other ally you control leaves play - People of Esgaroth might just die from the maximum health reduction. You'll need to work really hard to utilize them as defenders, and that's kinda the point.

 

In any case, refer to any cards posted here as a rough concepts.

I think I just came up with something more interesting than a boring stat boost for Watch Captain. Cool.

I think, global native stat boost on somebody(Dain, Boromir) hurts game's balance, because all cards that come are influenced by this boost's very existance and therefor are purposely weakened and hardly usable without the said boost in play.

Took me a little bit to understand Night Road Watch. At first he just seemed like all downside, but then I realized that he allows you to see shadow cards before they are normally revealed, which can combo nicely with other cards and at the very least gives you knowledge of something that would otherwise be unknown. I liked him a lot more now, and even with the -1 stats, he's still decently versatile with 1wp, 1atk, and 3hp.

I like him now, but Lore has enough 3-cost allies.

The point of Night Road Watch is that you may risk with some of his stats by exposing a shadow card. 

The theme, you know. He is a night watch. Night is a time when there is a lot of shadow. And if he exposed to an actual, living shadow, he is temporarily weakened.

Very nice. You should put the word "instead" at the end so that people know for sure that the enemy doesn't get this card AND the normal shadow card. Also, for this card, who does the word "your" pertain to? Doesn't "you" or "your" point to the controller of a card? Maybe it should be reworded to "... into play under the control of the defending player".

Great idea for a card!

> When resolving a shadow card, the defending player is the one referred as "you", as far as I know.

 

You're right. I couldn't remember any saying "you", only "defending character/player". I looked it up, though, and found Driven by Shadow, which says "If this attack is undefended, discard all attachments you control."

Wouldn´t this guy die as soon as he hits the table or did I miss something?

His passive effect wouldn't trigger before his demise?

Not that I have had much use for defining it before but I guess the removal of characters when they have 0 HP is also a passive ability; the question then is if the passive ability, that is an underlying effect throughout the game, trumps the activation of a new passive ability introduced or if the first player can decide that the +1HP/esgaroth triggers before the in-built "kill-switch".

I guess I need to change his health value into X.

I have to say I'm very impressed by these Trololo. I really like the interactions with the Esgaroth and Craftsman traits and the idea of attaching things to the quest or to a location. Well done!

Thank you.

Updated the set. Some cards got reworked, some cards got replaced with more fitting and interesting ones. Still monitoring everything closely. (linkz in the original post)

 

P.S.: Sorry for duplicates in the gallery, imgur acting strangely and I couldn't fix this.

So, recently I came up with an idea of new keyword aimed to support(mostly)
new trait and kind of play.

Craft X:
Craft Keyword on a player card itself means that it can host resource tokens even if it's not a hero. Those resource tokens cannot be spent in a usual manner, they can be interacted with only by card effects.
X represents the amount of resource tokens that the given card enters play with.

I would like to hear any opinions on this keyword. Here is some quick card changes due to this keyword:

These are really cool. My favorites are Hired Blade, Hard-Working Craftsman, and Fisherman. Love the versatility these cards add.

Thanks. What do you mean by versatility? One can assume that, as an example, Hired Blade just lost some versatility with this new keyword.

I like that *craft* introduces a new resource generation method, albeit with built in restrictions. These cards seem like they'd be a lot of fun to make a deck with.

Technically it's not resources, it's "counters", if you will, to track and interact with Craft keyword-related abilities. LotR LCG does not offers any spare tokens, so I used those at hand.
