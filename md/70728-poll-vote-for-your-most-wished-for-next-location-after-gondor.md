hmm… interesting post.  I'd have to go for Harad.  I reckon there's good scope for a lot of creativity without breaking the lore too much.

i agree on that….plenty of options

I'd really like B or N (my LOTRO character is a Breeman; I also think we need some snow cards, although I don't have KD or any of DD yet), but I'd bet we see A and F first (since they are the major LotR locations still unrepresented, once AtS comes out). If your Hobbit heroes in AtS hypothesis is right, Rich, I'd even say that would add more support to the Shire for next cycle (although I'm unsure why, as the DD heroes are fairly unrepresentative of Gondor, with the possible exception of Lore Aragorn). With B perhaps we'd get some Barrow Downs quests (or with A, I suppose).

N could get us lots of Snow, Orcs, and Black Numenoreans (if we go back in time). In fact we could have an Angmar/Forochel cycle that was in the Second Age (but we'd need a new Witch-King card right?).

F would be cool, we could have some Ents, Huorns (at least they made it into the extended cut), Saruman, hopefully a Theoden, probably a Grima, ERKENBRAND!!!, Eomer, maybe even going back Helm Hammerhand, Eorl, Thengel (so many options!). Maybe FFG will hold on a lot of the later characters for the Saga (if there is one), certainly we'll get a new Eowyn with the saga (maybe just an ally?). A cool quest (granted for a Saga Exp.) would be the "exorcism" of Theoden, much more drawn out in the book than in the movie, where one would have to find the different events/objects (hearken, rise up, gaze over the lands, grasp a sword hilt, etc.) in the encounter deck, although this might prove difficult as there were no enemies (ok maybe you could have guards and wormtongue, or a treachery "reach of saruman" or something like that). just an idea.

At any rate, for the purposes of this poll though I'm going to say that I'd really like to see B (Bree), although A is a close second (and darn I want some more horse-lords too!!!)

And that's why I'm sleeving now, so the cards will stay in good condition for a long time (esp. with small children running around). I want to have them to play once the small children are bigger and wanting to play instead of accidentally damaging cards. That being said, as you noted rich, sleeves are expensive. That last "to sleeve or not to sleeve thread got me considering a limited sleeve arrangement (current payer decks, all heroes, all quests, all encounters, popular cards) to save a little coin.

Mine is the Shire too. But I would like that cycle to cover the area around as well, perhaps the whole Eriador cycle; after all there are NINE quests to be included.

To stretch to answer further, sorry Richard, the next faction (after Gondor that is) that I would like to see developed is Silvan.

@ John- thats a good point- im hoping that there will be cards on the secondary market for a long time to come, incase any get lost/damaged etc

@benhanses- thanks for voting

@lleimmoen- thanks for voting- as for the factions, thats an interesting point in itself as often there seems no or little relation between cycle and faction, so id be interesting in knowing how/why ffg chose the races they do. i agree though- silvan needs it

Great idea this poll, rich. About my vote, although I would love ALL middle earth covered by this wonderful game, I think that a great place to visit after Gondor could be the lost realm of Cardolan (your B option).

And I say so thinking in the multiple options we can get  in these lands. For example, I would think something as the following:

1- Bandits arount the Gwathló.

Our fellowship could get to Minhiriath (the southern part of Cardolan) by sea with a message to Bree, and on arriving there, they are warned about lots of dunlendings bandits from Dunland and Enedwaith, plaguing the remnants of Cardolani people that live around the mouths of the Gwathló. Here we can get some new foes as the Dunlendings.

2- Ruins of Tharbad

Going up the river in a boat, they finally reach the ruins of Tharbad, and in this journey they can get some nasty river treacheries and locations in tharbad.

3- Spies within Bree

Finally reaching Bree, we can have here some hobbit interaction, and some quest of helping the Rangers uncovering dark spies within the city (maybe Saruman's agents that can lead lately to Isengard).

4- The Barrow Downs

The pursuit of Saruman's agents lead our heros to the Old Forest, and lately to the Barrow Downs, where we have the undead as new foes.

5- Retreat to Amon Sûl

Having to fight their way out of the Barrow Downs, our heros retreat to Weathertop, having to fight back the hordes of undead.

6- The Gap of Rohan

Free of the undead, our heros address south following the lead of the agents found in Bree. Here they could meet the Half-orcs of the White Hand along with the Dunlendings again due to travel across their lands.

And this could lead to a new cycle in Rohan.

What do you think?

 I would also really like to see Harad explored a bit more. It's been a long time since I last read any of Tolkein's books, but it would be nice to see that area fleshed out, although I'm not sure what the coinciding faction would be developed there (Gondor, which is already coming?). And more Silvan faction would be cool; definitely some of my favourite cards so far are Silvan.

@robert- that sounds fantastic- great ideas for the cyle….id be happy if we got something along those lines

@monkeyrama- thats an interesting point on the faction, i suppose it could be random, but that would feel a bit dissapointing….perhaps some of the southern factions of gondor?

thanks both for voting

EDIT - **** it, I forgot about the Deluxe expansion. Mmmm… it should be Bree, and re-arrange from there.

As I said before, the foes for this cycle could be the Dunlendings and the undead from the Barrow Downs.

And the player cards, we can get the Dúnedain and the Hobbits mainly.

I wouldn't dare happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif].

 

I think I should plan it like the following:

Deluxe: Bree (Spies within Bree and two more quest… maybe one of them a journey to buckland of hobbiton)

1- The Old Forest (with Old man willow, of course. old forest treacheries and locations)

2- The Barrow Downs (lots of undead)

3- Retreat to Amon Sûl (some evil undead again)

4- Ruins of Tharbad (dunlending bandits, river treacheries, and ruins locations)

5- Bandits arount the Gwathló (dunlending bandits)

6- The Gap of Rohan (half orcs and dunlendings)

 F - I love Rohan, but I can't really justify using them in any of the quests so far, thematically.  I'd love direct a band of Riders through a quest to protect the Mark from Dunland and the hordes of Isengard.

never thought of that- yeah it would be a good idea…….id also like (and have suggested this from the start) a post counter (which has gone) and poster levels….like

1-50 posts - young hobbit

50-250- hobbit tween

250-500- respectable hobbit

500-1000-hobbit mayor

2000- hobbit thain

 im annoyed they got rid of the post counter as i was 1000 + around christmas last year….so it would be cool to see how many i have now

things like that

what about a Cavalry Charge mechanic?

Cavalry Charge

if you control at least 5 mounted characters (see below) then all mounted characters gain

"exhaust as many mounted characters as you wish to declare them attackers against 1 enemy- that enemy does not count its defence

 

the mounted keyword is different from current horse traits as it specifies the cavalry from the standard riders

 the idea is to show the devastating effect of a cavalry charge…..it may sound overkill doing this to one enemy but im thinking more along the lines of taking down a mumak or a similar heavily armoured foe…..i also think mounted characters should have modest stats OR have something that says mounted characters gain -1 attack unless you control 5 mounted characters

 i also think there should be a risk to this like 'un-horsed' mechanic….where everytime you perform a charge you discard the top of the enounter deck and if its a treachery all attackers get 1 damage

also it would be cool to see some pikemen to counter act the cavalry charge where if you are engaged with a pike enemy, charges cant be performed

also an archer enemy that targets mounted character horses….not sure how that would work, but perhaps if the horse gets it, then they can join charges, get 2 damage and -1 all stats

 

the problem with all of this is that a different mounted mechanic stops the likes of theoden and dunhere and so on from carrying these out, and bit un-themeatic if you ask me…..

 

maybe you could have cavalry attatchments which give characters the trait????

Im A rich but i think after the Hobbit set that ffg may want to get away from the shire for a year to keep the game fresh.  Another thought that came to me is that some players may want to play the "bad guys" sometimes. How about 3 new heroes, say Saruman, Grima and Lurtz (just for example) then you get an encounter deck with locations as normal but enemies such as Rohan cavalry, Ents trying to break Isengard, a Faramir ambush. This idea totally flips the game around and creates a whole new aspect. Its a thought anyway!!!

thats a very interesting thought….though i think it may need a complete change of the game to make it happen (or to make it worth doing perhaps)

as for the hobbit though, i dont think ffg should worry about getting away from the shire….looking at the cards we only have 1 location, no player cards (apart from late adventuer i guess)….so we never really technically touched the shire, we sort of fast forwarded to the trollshaws

On the topic of the Hobbit (I don't have it yet), does Bag End show up as a location or is it just implicit in the first quest? What is the 1 shire location?

i do think it would go down very well (after all it is cool being the bad guys isnt it?) however how would it work with the player cards? all of them, apart from a few 'neutral' (not the sphere) ones are very 'good guys' specific, so it would either mean a) release a huge amount of cards at once or b) stick with a limited play scope….sort of a like a novelty one off packs….but would it fit?

im not so sure…..if they wanted to make it work i guess they could, however its more of a competative thing, rather than a coop game thing

 F - Rohan/Isengard 

One of my favorite areas….the "rohan" trait could use fleshed out a little more plus i'm dying to see a Theodan hero.  Isengard could also make for some cool quests…taking on Saruman….leading the Ents.  could be very exciting.

i can see the quests now

1) Leading the riders to take back Rohan's smaller villages

2) Defending an assault on Edoras

3) Counter-attacking Saruman at Isengard w/the help of the Ents

I'm really torn between L, M and N - Rhûn, Harad, and Angmar. I'm kinda supposing that Against the Shadow will have at least some more Harad folks continuing on from the deluxe, though I'm hoping we also see some Wainriders coming to attack Gondor too. Easterlings, those folks from Khand… basically, anyone other than Orcs, as I feel we've kinda overdosed on them so far (as iconic an enemy as they may be…)

Angmar is definitely somewhere I'm keen to explore though. Give Glorfindel something thematic to do, going up against the Witch-King in his own lair or something preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif] Somehow, though, I don't think we'll go there before we go to more obvious places in Middle Earth, like the Shire and Rohan. 

I'm going for M, but only on the proviso that we can get to L within the same cycle gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

I guess I would fit into C, but with the caviat that I want to see some Lindon and Arnor vs Angmar type action.  Maybe like a rise of the witch king cycle.

Seriously, I always liked Éowyn, she is nice and stuff, but when I saw the movies… ****! Seriously, the actress wasn't the greatest beauty in the world, but she was almost EXACTLY how I pictured her in my mind; the ferocity when battling, the softness when speaking with the little ones - and, well… In the end she get to know - and stay with - Faramir, brother of Boromir (my favorite male character). That's the history of how Éowyn became the hors concur of my favorite characters in Middle-Earth.

Some of the other most proeminent Rohan didn't received much spot-light time in the movies, I understand, but the feeling they gave of unity and loyalty… They are awesome. Éomund is another who should have way more lines and time; but well, that may just be my biased feeling talking.

 

Still, if I can vote again (which I know I can't), I vote for Rohan.

 

 

 

 

…yeah, you probably would've figured out already.

I would really like to have some scenarios about defending the Shire from the Ringwraiths. It could be to develop both the Hobbits and the Dunedain Rangers!

Race-wise, I really want to see Silvan Elves get some serious attention but I don't know how this would happen (geographically) outside of going back to Mirkwood again. Perhaps we could go somewhere like Rhun where's it's really more of a blank slate.

As for the next cycle, I would like to see Eriador. If they wanted to be more specific, then the Shire and it immediate surroundings.

I really hope to see story about Angmar or Harad or Umbar…….

 N- Angmar/ Northern Misty Mountains.

  Rohan will have its day and, IMO, will appear in the next few rounds of delux expansions (mounts anybody?). I'm not worried it won't show up, though I think some may be disappointed. This game takes place during the 17 years between Bilbo's going away party and Frodo leaving the Shire and really aught not to include any open hostilities involving Isenguard and the Free Peoples of Middle Earth. Saruman is still considered a member of the White Counsel by the Istari, after all.

It has been discussed elsewhere that "17 year" time span was chucked during the KD/DD cycle. Those two quest events are over 15 years (I think). Also (of course) the Saga packs are outside of that time span by quite a bit too.

I see…

NP, I don't mean to sound a smarmy smartass, I just thought I ought to pass that along.

My vote would be for L - Rhun.

I would like to see the Easterings as enemies. And Sauron had his initial realm in the East so maybe some locations and treachery cards could be linked to that thread? And according to The Tolkien Gateway, Rhun was conquered by Gondor twice which would tie in with the Heirs of Numenor Expansion.

Well I really battle between two:

M- Harad

O- Ice Bay of Forochel

Mayby the Norhern part of the Middle Earth because it it less explored, but still Harad has it merits! Pirate ships and sea battles (new game feature) and there is a lot prewar activities in there!

Ice bay of Forochel is still the best case. Sauron minions looking for the ring all the wrong plases. The wind that the Ice harsh weather conditions. Very nice looking location cards :-)

My choice is N Angmar/Northern Misty Mountains, but A + B would be welcome too.

I know I'm kind of late comment about this but where was this discussion took place?

As far as I can tell Dwarrowdelf took place in year 3009 which is within the timeline (because that's when Arwen moves from Lorien to Rivendell)
and Khazad-Dum has no specific date but must have happend sometime between 2994 (death of Balin) ~ 3018 (Fellowship enters Moria). And considering the time spawn of this game is from 3001 ~ 3018 it is entirely possible to fit Khazad-Dum within the game's time frame as well.

So far only quests that cannot be placed within the Time Frame are Hobbit and LakeTown and they are kind of exception (one is Saga expansion which is supposed to be outside of game's timeframe and the other was gencon event).

Was thinking that Mount Gundabad might be a good location, but can´t seem to find it on the list

O- Ice Bay of Forochel
