Hello all,

 

 

If you all wouldn't mind it, I would like to request 1 minute of silence to honour this great person, actor, singer and Tolkien fan: Christopher Lee.

 

He will be missed.

Say what? I was not aware of it until now.

Great actor, not only in LotR, until the end of his days.

r.i.p. Sir Christopher Lee

Agreed. Very sad news.

 

RIP Sir Christopher Lee.

Indeed, one of the greatest british men in late history. A great actor, secret agent (for real), vampire, heavy metal vocalist, Tolkien savant, and human being. Rest in peace.

I just read an article on him over at The Verge.  What a full life!  Rest in Peace and thanks for all.

Legend, one of the few true to the meaning of the word.

I have already raised a glass in tribute.

Too many wonderous achievements to mention.

Cheers Mr Sir Lee

He lived with passion, clearly demonstrated by the hundreds of films he made, his relation with the music or being voluntered during World War. R.I.P.

R.I.P. Sir Christopher Lee ...

While we're in the spirit, I like to think he's been granted passage to Valinor and is now having a pint with Tolkien on the slopes of Taniquetil. We all knew this was bound to happen, but it is hard to accept. Great actor, great man. I have only recently learnt that he recorded The Children of Hurin as an audio book, and I'll make sure to find it once I've finished the Silmarillion. His voice is iconic.

I know what I'm going to be listening to next. Children of Hurin is far and away my favorite of all of Tolkien's works. I can't think of a better fit to read that story than Sir Lee.
