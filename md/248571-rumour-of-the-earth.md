I love this card!! - but I fear I may be mis-playing it.... I often use it in an early turn action window to peak at the upcoming encounter card, then pay a lore resource to return it to my hand.  Later, in the combat phase, can I use it again to peak at an encounter card I know will be my next shadow effect card?  It just seems like using it twice in the same round gives me an unfair (but much needed) advantage.

Yes and no.  It is fine to use the card as many times as you want, whenever you have an action window, and return it to your hand, as long as you can pay for it. However, you don't have an action window in the combat phase before shadow cards are dealt out. To do what you want to do, you need to use it during the encounter phase, after engaging enemies. So in short you are playing correctly, just adjust your above post to read "encounter phase" instead of "combat phase."

Scrying effects like this one are very powerful in solo games, but less powerful in multi-player.

Also, paying 1+ resources a turn is a significant burden. Consider using Henamarth Riversong, who gives you the effect without ongoing cost, you can then keep this card for when you need to scry more than once per turn.
