I'm always confused by this effect and the extent that it applies. In the Battle for Laketown Smaug has this ruling. Does this mean Erebor Battle Master doesn't get his bonus attacks, this is a player card effect? What about Gandalf's ability to apply 4 damage? I can understand cards like Forest Snare not being eligible but how far do you apply this immunity?

Player cards cannot target a card like this. So, Battle Master works as his ability only affects himself (it's not "targeting" any enemy - the boost simply affects his base stat) whereas Gandalf has to choose a target for damage, so he doesn't work.

More examples:

 * Boromir's ability doesn't affect Smaug.
 * Traps can't be attached to immune Enemies.
 * Bard's ability doesn't lower Smaugs defense
 * You can attack "immune to card effect" Enemies using the Ranged keyword.
