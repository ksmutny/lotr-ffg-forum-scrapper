Play a game, read a book or watch a movie to celebrate!

Or release a news article about your main LOTR themed game!

Might as well put this here as anywhere:  Ares will soon be releasing a hidden movement game called "Hunt for the Ring" that you can use as a lead in to "War of the Ring".  Results from Hunt can affect setup for War.  (That part might not work so well for the Free Peoples player.)  I've got my eye on it anyway and it should be out in November or so.  Maybe we'll even have Cirith Gurat by then.

This. Preferably with official purchasable playmates, now that (almost?) every other LCG has them.

Today is my wife's birthday, which every year, I remind her she shares with Bilbo and Frodo...

And ever year, she remains unimpressed, while I remain a tad bit jealous of her.

This typo made me laugh and laugh, in a good-natured way.
