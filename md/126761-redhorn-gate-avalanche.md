Okay, 

 

I'm in set-up - haven't really started the game. Avalanche! reads:

 

When Revealed: Exhaust each ready character and if it is the quest phase commit them to the quest. 

 

Seriously?   :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png]

 

Does this mean I exhaust everyone and get creamed on the very first turn as my threat goes through the roof, OR does the word 'and' save me.  (Well, not through the roof but 4 or 5 sucks to start a game.)

 

Someone please tell me I'm reading this wrong. 

 

Thanx!

You're gonna have to exhaust all characters.  There are a few other cards that can that screw you over like this.  Old Wives' Tales from The Hunt for Gollum comes to mind.

Shuffle, shuffle, shuffle.  New game.

Yep. Those three are some of the worst.

Mince them fine is the worst imo.... I concede instantly if it appears during setup.

I guess the good thing is that it's easy to reboot - shuffle encounter deck - new card, it's not like I had a chance to play anything. 

 

Sleeping Sentry - yeah - I remember that one. I think I started over after that one too.

Yeap, it sucks to exhaust Eleanor at the start of the game, she is out for whole turn :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Can't you use her response at the setup ?

I drew Old Wives' Tales during setup for Nightmare Hunt for Gollum. It was annoying, but I recovered and won the quest anyway. If something like that happens, I'd at least start to play out the first round before restarting the game.

At least not much chance you quest succesfully to trigger effect and reveal additional cards XD
