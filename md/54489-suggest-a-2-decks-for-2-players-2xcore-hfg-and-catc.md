Hi there...

I have a mate coming over to show him LoTR and I hope to addict him so I have a partner.. I have only played solo, and would like to pre-build 2 decks that go together so we can have a few decent games starting in CORE and moving on.

I have 2xCore, HFG and CatC.

If you have a good 2 player deck list for us to try out.. that would be really sweet.. thanks for the help

I bought 2x Core Set and made four decks, using all 12 heroes. Took the baselines for the decks from this thread:

www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/644987/two-core-sets-four-compelling-decks [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/644987/two-core-sets-four-compelling-decks]

and have of course swapped out some cards whenever I've added an expansion. Only thing I've swapped in the heroes are Dunhere and Eowyn, so it's Eowyn/Gimli/Thalin. When playing the quest, pairing off each of the decks with another (for 6 plays each quest), didn't lose against Passage, 3-3 vs Anduin (and started 3-0 llorando.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/llorando.gif] ), 4-2 vs HFG (though these were all painful games, some very close, but don't like this quest much; did better without Northern Trackers than with them for some reason) and currently 4-0 vs CatC which is proving the easiest quest since Passage, Carrock's 7 must be some kind of misprint, it's more like a 2 or 3 in my book.

 Since I am responsible for that mess, I think I can recommend it ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Uses two decks with a very different strategy with the intention of synergy (called Hammer & Anvil), maybe this is for you.
