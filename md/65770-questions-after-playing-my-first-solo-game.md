 So, I just completed 'Passage Through Mirkwood' and I have some questions. At what point do I move onto the next stage of the quest when the current phase has met all the quest tokens it needs? I waited until the end of the round. Secondly, when I beat phase 3B of 'Passage Through Mirkwood" do I win once I defeat 'Ungoliant's Spawn'? Or do I need to defeat all the other enemies in play? 

 

Thanks!

as soon as you place all the tokens it progresses

as soon as you kill the spawn

1. You move on to the next quest stage as soon as sufficient quest tokens have been placed on the previous one (and any other requirements are also met). Typically, this will be during the quest phase but it can happen at other times (eg from Legolas' effect).

2. It depends which of the two 3B stages you have randomly drawn.

Don't Leave the Path requires you to defeat Ungoliant's Spawn and therefore you win the moment this happens.

Beorn's Path requires you to place 10 progress and to have got rid of Ungoliant's Spawn if she has entered play - you don't have to find and kill it, only defeat it if it has shown up via encounter deck draws.

In neither case do you have to defeat any other enemies.

Another newbie follow up.

Assume that I'm exploring a location with a required quest progress of 2.  I manage to get 3 progress tokens.  I've been playing that I put 2 on the location, which explores it, and then immediately place the third token on the main quest. 

Is that correct?

That is correct. Your questing willpower (above staging area threat) goes on the current active location first and then any remaining goes onto the current quest stage. There are a few locations that have specific text that may vary this but 99% of the time it will work that way.

Thanks! 

As a side note, I love this community.  Such a helpful and friendly lot.  :-)

If only the Internetz could learn to be more like us.  :-D

 I too am playing solo and am very new to the game. I love LOTR and I love card games. So far, this is a great mesh! However, I am running into many questions as well. 

1. If I reveal a card with no shadow effect, does it simply go to the discard pile, or is it placed in the staging area if it is a creature, resolved if it is a treachery, and so on? 

2. In "Passage Through Mirkwood", is it legal for one of the spider cards you search for to be Ungoliant's Spawn?

3. Once I have reached stage 3B, where it requires no quest counters, only Ungoliant's Spawns death, does the quest phase still cary on as normal? (i.e. do I always reveal a new encounter card even if I do not commit to a quest?)

4. Is it as challenging to beat the Mirkwood in solo play as it seems right now ; )

5. What are the guidelines for deck building? I know in the back of the rule manual it says minimum of 50 cards for tournament play. I'm assuming that I could build a new deck in this manner to better my odds in solo play? Right now I'm just playing with the Spirit deck that comes with the base game.

Phew! Many questions. Thanks for taking the time to help in advance!

1.shadow cards only count their shadow effects, so if it doesnt have shadow text no effect happens

2.yes-thats usually what you would pick - unless its already in play then you search for another

3.yes, questing and so on continues as per normal, the game ends once ungoliant is defeated

4.this game gets much easier with the growing card pool and experience- ive played hundreds of solo games in the last 1.5 yrs and i assure you things get easier :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

5.i urge you to start building multi sphere decks, this is what the game is really designed around and the core decks are just for the first couple of games- rules are

-minimum 50 cards but no upper limit- stick to 50-55 to maximise the chances of drawing the cards you want

-max 3 copies of each card unless otherwise stated (there is only 1 card in later packs that you can have only 1 of)

 Thanks so much for clarifying these things for me! I greatly appreciate it and am piecing together a new deck pronto.

 Good news! The first game after piecing together a new 55 card deck, I finally beat Passage Through Mirkwood, with a 58. Probably not a good score, but heck, I was successful. Good times, and thanks again for the help!
