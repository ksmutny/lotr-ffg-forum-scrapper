My brother and I are big fans of this game, but since I'm currently staioned overseas it'll be a long while before we can play again. I'm just wondering if anyone has put together a program to play online, something like what's available for AGOT. If anyone has any info on something like that it would be greatly appreciated. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

OCTGN is pretty amazing

Octgn.net has the game client app, and octgngames.com is where you'll find out how to add LotR LCG to OCTGN. It's a pretty nice app.

Oh very interresting - I have to take a look too!
I also found Vasal! Is it better or worst than OCTGN?

I have experience in OCTGN and it always runs good. You can play with lots of gamers around the world in any hour. You can meet with your friends by online if you can't physically. Also, you can know new gamers, but lotr is not too usually than netrunner or magic. But it is good, if you have patience you just get playing.

A few time ago, i tried Lackey, but it runs slowly and it seems have problems, and a very few gamers. OCTGN i think is better.

 

If you are thinking to play OCTGN..., let's go! Welcome!!! If lotr has more players online, it surely becomes funnier, and easier to play as a world-player-community

I tried it a few times but find it very difficult to create the decks. Long lists of cards makes me loose fancy...

Maybe a card game (sorting and admire the cards :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png] ) can not replace a real card game to me :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

If anyone is looking for LOTR friends on OCTGN then add me username MathGuru83. I just downloaded and tried the first 3 scenarios solo. Your right, the tool is pretty awesome

Legoland, you can create your player decks manually and after, make them in octgn by name filter... :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

Legoland, you can  import decks from cardgamedb.com or just use search option an octgn and make decks. I have greated decks to cardgamedb and after then i have imported them to the octgn :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
