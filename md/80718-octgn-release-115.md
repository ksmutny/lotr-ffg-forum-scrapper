The new release along with user guide and faq can be found here [http://octgn.gamersjudgement.com/viewtopic.php?f=25&t=656].

It includes updated images for cards affected by the 1.4 Errata, a new board layout and more control over turn automation.

There is also a new set with 3 quests by Cordeirooo (The Blue Wizards) and a censored set for Heirs of Numenor.

Loving the new auto-phase.

No more need to try and guess if another player is done with their phase or wants to play an action .

I updated from 1.1.2 to 1.1.5 today.

For some reason, The Hills of Emyn Muil set isn't updating correctly.  There are 2 problems:

1) When I install it, OCTGN says the version is 1.3 instead of 1.4

2) No Emyn Muil encounter deck was added to the data/Decks folder.

The other Core and Mirkwood sets all worked fine (correct version numbers, decks added to data/Decks).

Anyone else have this problem?

Thanks for reporting the problem with THoEM. I've found and fixed the problem and the updated set file is available to download [https://www.dropbox.com/s/dabmmbtjx2vhgsc/LOTR-005-The-Hills-of-Emyn-Muil-1.4.o8s].
