Hi all,

 

today I played a 2 player game in The Hunt for Gollum Nightmare and we can into the next situation. I played Ravens of the Mountain and we found the Ravenous Hawk.

I wondered what the outcome would be. I thought the following. We engage the ravenous hawk because we looked at it because of a card effect, and afterwards he returns to the top of the encounter deck because Ravens of the Mountains explicitely states that the card goes to the top of the encounter deck. Was this play correct or not?

 

Some explanation would be nice.

There is no more explanation than that... you might want to ask Caleb if you want a definitive answer.

The Hawks forced effect never trigger, since the Ravens doesn't instruct you to look at cards. You only get to shuffle and reveal.

The Errata'd version of the Ravens does state look:

 

Ravens of the Mountain OtD 11 Should read: “Action: Exhaust a hero you control to shuffle the encounter deck and look at its top card..."

It is because of this Errata I didn't know what the outcome would be, since I think the Ravenous Hawk's Forced effect gets triggered

This needs an official ruling, but my hunch is that the Ravenous Hawk is put into play engaged with you and stays that way. I could certainly be wrong, but generally those forced effects and strong words like "must" tend to supersede everything else.

I asled Caleb and this is the answer :

>  
> 
> If you look at Ravenous Hawk with Ravens of the Mountain, you will put it into play. Then you will place progress on the quest equal to its threat strength, and then you will put Ravenous Hawk back on top of the encounter deck.

Simply resolve each line one by one.

Sorry for necroing this thread, but I have another question about Ravenous Hawk. Does the forced effect trigger on a Ravenous Hawk card that you draw as a result of the forced effect on quest card 1B or 2B or can the effect only trigger on Ravenous Hawk cards already in play? I think I read somewhere that forced effects can only trigger on cards that are already in play. If you draw the card as a result of the forced effect on quest card 1B or 2B you are only looking at it and it isn't technically considered to be in play until you choose to reveal it. Or am I getting this wrong?

I just noticed the new Rules Reference document. Under In Play and Out of Play it says:

“Out of play” refers to the cards in a player’s hand, deck, and discard pile, the encounter deck, encounter discard pile, cards in the victory display, cards set aside, and cards removed from the game.

 * Card abilities can only be initiated or affect the game from an in-play area unless they specifically refer to being used from an out-of-play area, or require that the card be out of play for the ability to resolve. Play restrictions and permissions are an exception that may affect how a card may or may not be deployed or used.

I am not really sure what this would mean in this context though. Probably that the forced effect can trigger on a Ravenous Hawk card drawn as a result of the forced effect on quest card 1B or 2B (which I guess was the intent from the designer).

This is what will happen with the hawk's ability.

True.

The new rules document is already useful!
