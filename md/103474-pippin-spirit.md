Playing him in Shadow of the Past: 2 nazguls in staging, you lose the hidden check, and Nazguls engages you...

can you use pippin's hability to return them to staging area. Can you use Pippin twice? or three or four times? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Pippin´s ability does not mention that it is limited so can´t see why you couldn´t just do the old "rinse and repeat". Will set your threat quite a ways upwards, though there are of course ways to counteract that.

Ok, thanks.

 

Another question: can you avoid the immediate attack of Nazguls with hability of Pippin? or do they attack anyway from staging?

No, spirit Pippin does not cancel the engagement. All engagement effect are triggered.

So Feint, Hobbit Sense, Ticket Spears, etc..., can't avoid the attack, isn't?

## 6 [alogos on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103474-pippin-spirit/?do=findComment&comment=1043123)

well, not if you used pippin response where you haven't time to play action and the actions of those cards only target engaged enemy (not sure of the text for feint thought, maybe that one is possible)

Feint is a Combat Action, so you won't have a window to play it before you get engaged.

## 8 [Mndela on April 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103474-pippin-spirit/?do=findComment&comment=1043528)

But, how about if it was not combat action? Could you use feint anyway? I think not, no time for actions, the attack has started

Yeah, the attack has already started once the effect has been triggered.  Too late to prevent it even if you have a card that can prevent attacks.

Although... if there is more than one enemy attacking you could use an action card in between the steps of the first enemy´s attack.

Yes i know, the problem is that: if the attack has started, even using Pippin's hability, the Nazgul continues attacking, even from staging. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Yup. But again if engaged by more than one enemy, you can at least mitigate the problem somewhat

Some of the discussion was about generic enemy and the other was specifically on the nazgul.

It's becomming quite hard to read this topic...

 

Well, anyway , does anyone seriously play him ? with a deck based around him ? I'm trying to make one myself before burying this card in the pit of the moria like I just did with Fatty Bolger...

LONG LIVE FATTY

The idea was: i lost a hidden cache, but with pippin i couldn't avoid the engagement and immediate attack of 3 nazguls. Well, yes i could send them to staging, but not the immediate attack. Is it correct?

## 16 [alogos on April 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103474-pippin-spirit/?do=findComment&comment=1046577)

yes, everyone was write in this topic.
