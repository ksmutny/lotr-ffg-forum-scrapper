Ok me and my mate played the 1st quest of the treason of saruman (the chase?) and was wondering if we had done this correctly.

Basically once we had picked our character to be captured we set out threat level to what it would be now we only have 2 heros and now 3

Was this correct or should we have used the other heros threat as well?

Hope we done it correctly as we won and I don't want to be doing all that chasing again :-P

I do not believe that is correct.

 

In the core set rulebook, under "Setup", the 2nd step is "Place Heroes and Set Initial Threat Levels".  The 7th step is "Follow Scenario Setup Instruction" which is following the instructions on the quest card.  So your threat would be included for all 3 of your heroes before one of them would be "captured" via quest stage 1.  Also I guess in general with this game, if you're not sure of the ruling on how something goes...its nearly always the option that makes it harder for the player ha

If you aren't playing a saga campaign though you can always use a lower threat hero and have them in the deck for no reason other than to get captured. If you aren't using spirit Glorfindel he's great for it, I personally used Bombur since he has a nice low threat and it is very hard for Grishnakh to kill him.

If Beorn is your captured hero, feel free to laugh at Grishnakh as he attempts to 'do him in' over 10 rounds.

"Oh no! Ten rounds from now Beorn will be dead! How can we possibly finish the quest by then?!"

I didn't notice Grisnakh mentioned on the quest cards, is it random and not guaranteed that you will have to face him and that he will take one of the captives or did I read wrong?

Merry (who has 2 HP) was the captive in my playthrough. So... that was a problem when Grishnakh showed up.

He just goes into the encounter deck, PsychoRocka, so there's a chance you'll get through the game without having to face him.  But if you want to face him, you can guarantee it, as the 2nd quest stage has a 'search the encounter deck and discard pile' effect on it.

oh cool, I love when they do this and you can follow the story exactly or have your own version.

Like how you can sacrifice a hero to defeat the balrog, OR you can just hold it off and escape leaving it behind (I imagine this would have far more dire consequences however especially if Sauron somehow convinced the Balrog to fight for him) or you can escape before it even shows its face! (what I did). 

Same with Fallen into Evil, I once had a really cool game where for a brief moment Haldir succumbed to the lure of the ring but was quickly calmed down and healed of this affliction by Halbarad and some Athelas just before he could let loose an arrow straight into Frodo's face. Perhaps Elrond made a big mistake sending Haldir instead of Legolas in my alternate universe  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Everybody here talking about Grishnak nibling on Beorn for 10 rounds as a captive and I´m just here sitting in the corner whispering: "Pipin with 2 HP, which I have choosen at the end of Road darkens not knowing what will happen, please don´t die, please, please." :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

And yes. The thematic possibilities and choices are excellent. In my game Merry has Fallen into Evil. "I want to be the ring-bearer. You get all the glory, thats not fair. Give it to me. It should have been mine. It is mine. It is my precioussss."

I believe Pharmboys' answer to be the true answer.  That was the case whwn playing Escape from Dol Guldur, which is the only quest with a similar mechanic....
