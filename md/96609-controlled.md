Does a player "control" an attachment card in his hand that has not yet been played?  For example, if a shadow effect is revealed that says the player must choose and discard 1 attachment he controls and there are no attachments that have been played, he must discard an attachment from his or her hand?

 

Thanks again!

No you wouldn't.
