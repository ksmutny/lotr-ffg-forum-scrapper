 I recorded a brief video which shows how the Flambeau 7004R container works out for storing all of the current cards. The video is available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMOhmUIa0SA [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMOhmUIa0SA]

If you like to keep premade decks put together you could store those in a separate deck box or squeeze things around to free up one of the 16 compartments.

If I like this solution after a while then I may get another of the same container. That would allow for the coming APs and would also free up some space so the individual compartments don't need to be so full. When the compartments get really full it is tough to get the cards out. I may lay a ribbon or something in the tighter compartments to help deal with that.

Apologies.
