It feels this could be a winner, love the locations especially.

What I am interested to know, is IF we are going to get all Nine Nazgul ... I would love that

You have a point on this .... maybe they could have Witch King and Khamul as separete, and the others just as Nazgu with a bit of difference at stats

yes, or they could do similar to what they have with other 'nameless' enemies and have for example

 

'nazgul of durthang'

'nazgul of minas morgul'

'nazgul of dol guldur'

'nazgul of barad dur'

'nazgul of the eastern kingdom'

 

etc

 

or i know the warhammer lotr had each nazgul from a different kingdom or province, as they were before they were corrupted

What you propose is even better  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]   , and also what you write for the warhammer .... If I remember well at least four of them where kings from Numenor before they became Nazgul

## 10 [Gizlivadi on August 19, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=844259)

Or not necessarily "nazgul of" but something else like "fell rider" as they've already done, or "wraith on wings", "black captain" which are words used to describe the nazgul.

## 11 [richsabre on August 19, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=844277)

or it could be the really boring way and just have 8 x ringwraith enemy and 1 witch king

## 12 [Glaurung on August 19, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=844391)

Really cool to see some attachments on enemies. And also cool all f them is surge! We need it long time already.

what i would say is what we need is less surge....it is a keyword i cannot stand in this game and drives quests to luck play

Total agree. Down with surge!

Iagree that we do not need so much surge ... attachments that give bonus to enemies would be ok

## 16 [player1761766 on August 19, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=844550)

Oh my goodness, that Weathertop card looks fantastic! I've been looking forward to seeing Weathertop in this game forever. 

 

I'd just like to add my rather innocuous voice to the "down with Surge!" vote, as well  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Can anyone tell me, as someone who prefers to have all of the scenarios set up rather than forever deconstructing encounter decks, how many copies of this box will be required to keep all three scenarios permanently set up? Ta!

I like this idea. Well, I never like it when playing the game, but I like the idea  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

no. but there is not just 1 version of the black riders in this set.

Great write up on the cards.  I really enjoy some of the villains that i've seen for the knife in the dark scenario;  Bill Ferny is just hilariously evil and the "squint eyed southener" is equal parts dastardly and comical.  Very original stuff.

 

Also to throw in my two cents for the "surge" discussion that has seem to start, i think it should only be limited to the treacheries that potentially have no effect.  Any treachery that is guaranteed to do something negative i dont feel needs it whereas if the negative effect is conditional than surge is ok to ensure that the players dont get a "free" turn from staging.

 

For example, I think the cards that implement it best are those which dont outright say "surge" then the card effect, but give an effect but then if that effect wouldnt trigger, surge.  For example... (just making this up)...Each player raises their threat by each ally committed to the quest, if no allies are committed to the quest, this card gains surge.  I think that makes it more "fair"

I've only gotten to play the first scenario so far but I really enjoyed it. Loving the art and the thematic value was top notch

## 24 [Nickpes on August 20, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=845496)

I didn't go to Gencon but my gaming brother did. He got me a copy.

## 27 [Nickpes on August 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88744-black-riders-encounter-card-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=845958)

Oh, I thought that it was only to present it there, I did not know that people could buy it. My mistake
