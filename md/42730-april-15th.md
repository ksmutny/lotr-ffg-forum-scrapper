# [April 15th?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42730-april-15th/)

I am seeing on one of the distributors sites that I use to track upcoming releases a release date of April 15th. They are usually fairly accurate.

So I guess as some of us are not looking forward to mailing our taxes in that day we can balance it by looking forward to digging into this game for the first time.

That would be a nice present on tax day.

 heck yes! I wish I knew the card distribution of the core set. I'm buying at least two, but it'd be nice to get a list.  Hopefully once the rules are up... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Tax Day this year is April 18th.  True story.

I started out really excited for this game, then sort of forgot about it....  Now reading up on all the news i missed and am really excited again!  Roll on April.

Really looking forward to trying out this game.  I just hope that the time waiting for it to come out is made up by an excellent game.

Has someone heared any official release date news?

Becouse I only heraed a rumour that it should be avaliable at 19th april 2011 but it's not confirmed.

Here's the link from the German publisher's site:

www.heidelbaer.de/de/nc/einzelansicht-spiel/spiel/der_herr_der_ringe_kartenspiel/ [http://www.heidelbaer.de/de/nc/einzelansicht-spiel/spiel/der_herr_der_ringe_kartenspiel/?sword_list%5B0%5D=lord&sword_list%5B1%5D=of&sword_list%5B2%5D=the&sword_list%5B3%5D=rings]

It says April (, though not necessarily 15th).

According to the German forum, translation of the Core game is finished, the German rules pdf is ready to be uploaded (they're waiting for FFG to put the English version up first), Adventure Packs have either already been translated or are currently being translated, and last week the game was demonstrated using the (self-printed) product version of the Core set.

On other hand, I know that it will be avaliable in Europe on May 2011 - the news is from yesterday. I know it from my FLGS (Rebel.pl) and they got an official replay from FFG about the release date. So this must be true!

Besides it's finaly in pre-order so I just bought my a copy of the core set and the first Adventure Pack. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

I think i hate you for this comment :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] April 15 was a better and closer date but what can you do?My old Gandalf deck (lotr tcg) will torture my friends Nazguls 15 more days :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Of course, it will be available in May 2011 - unless it's already sold out after being released in April! gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

Here is the link to the GTS Distribution site where I saw it. They have it listed under their Boxed Games category instead of Card Games for the first release. I imagine they will change this once the chapter packs start coming out since Ctuthlu, Game of Thrones and Warhammer Invasion are all listed that way.

I am going all "Runebound" on this one...already told my game guy that I want every expansion until further notice.   This is the game I've been waiting for!

Exciting things about this game include:

1) It's LotR

2) it's constructable, but not "collectible" (i.e., it's a LCG!  yay!)

3) it's Fantasy Flight

4) it's COOPERATIVE

 

I am so excited about this game I can't stand it!  ha!

No1 its enough for me to play this game gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] I just hope it will be a nice game cause my other option is lotr miniatures and its not popular in Greece.

Ofcourse lotr war in the north will come sometime in 2011 but a video game gets boring very fast and i dont even know if it will be a decent game.

Yes, so I would still think that end of April or beggining of May 2011 is more  likely then 15th April. We must also count 7-10 day for the shipping.

I still play LOTR tcg with some friends and with home rules but i want somethink new.Also i am reading Silmarilion again lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

## 24 [Dam the Man on March 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42730-april-15th/?do=findComment&comment=434858)

Well, at least you're doing something right (not the LotR TCG part lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] ), since Silmarillion is for me the best M-E book. Everything is on a larger, more epic scale from LotR, victories and defeats feel more critical and important. Nowadays I don't really even try to read LotR anymore, it just feels so small potatoes compared to the events in Silmarillion.

I cant agree more with you.Silmarilion is a masterpiece.

Without Silmarilion you cant realy understand the events and the characters of LOTR trilogy.LOTR alone is a great story but with Silmarilion you can see the diference between a great story and a masterpiece.

As for the Lotr tcg was a nice game at the begining but i am not sure that those guys in Desipher know many things about Tolkiens lore (Gimli ringbearer???)sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

I've been playing MECCG and slowly reading the rules for ME Quest. Does that count?

You seem to be doing it backwards gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] . MEQ has really simple rules compared to Meccg and plays faster as well.

I'd say MEQ averages 75 minutes, Meccg 90-150 minutes for a normal two deck game. Meccg probably faster F2F, but I mostly hang out at GCCG and check out online games.

Note that these times are correct for Dam. For other players apply a factor of 1.5 to 2 to get realistic times. Cheers! gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 

 

I don't think we've ever finished a game of MEQ in under 2 hours - and that's for two-player games. Add more players and the time will go up even more.

If it makes you feel any better, not only do I have to wait for it to be released in Europe, I also have to wait until it shipped from the United Kingdom to me here in Australia. Sadly, while I would have loved to buy it locally, my local games store wasn't an option as I mentioned above, and online retailers seem to charge exorbitant amounts for both the item and postage. But that's buying things in Australia for you.

Oh, please let it be in stores very soon, I can't wait for it. I pre-ordered my copy a a few week agocan't wait until I have it in my hands.

It's going to be at least another couple of weeks. It's still on the boat the as it's been on the boat for a little while now it should be hitting warehouses pretty soon. From there I'd expect at least a week for it to then get out to stores. I think April 15th is probably a relatively close bet at the moment. But I'd be surprised to see it much sooner than that.

I am a bit confused, too. The German amazon lists April 30th as a date, but amazon Japan lists 05/2011as a date. Since I live in Japan I preordered the game there and the shipping date is listed as beginning of june (!) 2011.

 Dang. Amazon.ca has the game, but the US version doesn't? Lucky. If the friendly local game store (if that place is even still open) doesn't get it within a few days of release, I'll have to find a good online place. I was hoping it would be Amazon. 

Wish I could sleep through the next three weeks; wake up rested and energized for the game...

I've been told you don't want to rely on Amazon for quick releases of board games, they aren't set up to keep a close eye on release dates. Use an online board game retailer.

## 53 [faith_star83 on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42730-april-15th/?do=findComment&comment=444856)

In Japan there are only few shops handling English language boardgames...so I'm afraid amazon is the best choice here. As for the US I think there are so many different opportunities..

Yup, Amazon Release Dates are entirely unreliable. I stopped using them to order board games (or card games, rpgs and minis) a long time ago.

Duly noted. I will skulk around the internet to see if there is any good retailer, maybe one I have used in the past. I did use Strike Zone to get the Marvel Boardgame from FFG, that seemed to go well. May go back to them again.

Expansions and extra core sets will be from the FLGS, assuming they have any (not a sure thing, they had no heroclix last time I was there)

Does anybody know if ffg will anounce the release date anytime soon? Or will the game be suddenly available...?

## 57 [Bohemond2 on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42730-april-15th/?do=findComment&comment=445299)

The next date we will get comes when the game ships to distributors.  From that point, it is 4-7 days until it is one shelves.

While I typically recommend the FLGS, if you are specifically looking for an online retailer that currently has a pre-order up I would recommend Miniature Market. They usually ship pretty fast.

I can confirm that  - I also got a news from one of the publishers. The release date is 17th/18th April 2011. I wonder only how long will we have to wait to get it in Europe? I hope not to long.

Lo and behold, another Portuguese person! How nice to see a fellow countryman around.

As for the release date, I'm going to be very annoyed if Portugal/Spain get it before the UK, since I pre-ordered it from Maelstrom Games hahahah. Ahh I'll just have to wait and see

Thanks for the amazon link. Shame it isn't discounted like amazon.ca, etc. Oh well.

How long does it take for a game to get to stores after it gets off of the boat? the 15th is getting ever closer, but the status remains the same. Hope we don't miss the 15th, but my doubts grow.

In my experience with things like books and movies, Amazon's listed release date is the date that A) You could buy the item in a brick and mortar and B) Amazon tries to get it shipped to you by, as long as you paid for shipping.

Is it different for games? I definitely saw the Amazon date and on thought "Great, it will be in stores that day!"

So, here's a probably dumb question, but when the little "on the boat" icon changes to "shipping now."  Can I run down the street at get it from the Roseville store?  Or do I have to break into the warehouse?  (Yes, I know I lucked out in that I fell in love with the idea of this game months before I realized how close I was to ffg headquarters...)

## 95 [Toqtamish on April 9, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42730-april-15th/?do=findComment&comment=451548)

Shipping now is when it is moving from FFG to distributors, stores etc. So best to wait, I usually just call my store to see when  his order is arriving. But since you leave so close to the proverbial horses mouth might want to call them. They would have it for sure on the release date as they would want to release there at the same time as all of the other stores being able to officially release it. So you are lucky in that you are guaranteed to have it on time.

if you limit youself to 1-2 spheres per deck, that gives you a total of 112 different three hero combinations. multiply that by three different quests. Plus there is easy mode, hard mode And Nightmare mode. If you get tired of all of those, you can try a three sphere deck Or even a four sphere deck! I'm going to have to quit my job and give up sleep!
