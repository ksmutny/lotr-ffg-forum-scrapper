Hey everyone! I decided to write up my thoughts on the spoiled cards from Wilds of Rhovanion and put together a draft deck to take on the Deluxe with! Take a look and let me know what you think about the cards we have seen from the upcoming cycle!

Good job. One question are you sure  that transfering an item attachment using lore ally ability trigger the card draw ability? It dies hot seem that the card is Played when transferred. Thanks. Keep going

Oh sorry for any confusion! I said he mostly likely will not trigger the card draw! Probably could have worded it a bit better!
