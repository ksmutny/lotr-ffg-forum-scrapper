# [Foundations of Stone - Nameless Thing + Ithilen Archer](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191021-foundations-of-stone-nameless-thing-ithilen-archer/)

Stage 5 of this great quest and a Nameless Thing engages me. Forced, I add 2 cards from my deck to make his attack and health value (5).

 

I have 2 Ithilien Archers in play who after causing damage to the Nameless Thing send him back to the Staging Area.

 

So, on the next round, do I add 2 additional cards to the Nameless Thing, thus increasing his attack and health value still further, as he engages me again?

 

Many thanks in advance.

Yep, it gets cards whenever it engages a player.

Thanks for reply.

 

That's so mean! I shall have to replace my archers.

You could just choose not to trigger their ability.

I agree. I put them in the deck because the Moria bats can only be targeted by ranged characters. I also have Ent allies which are quite strong and more suited to the Nameless Thing. So, yes, for now I will keep them in the deck but avoid this situation when it arises.

Or make a deck that only consist of 0 or X cost cards... just to show those nameless things what´s what ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Or make a trap deck and have the Nameless Things attach traps to themselves.

Q: If a card is attached to Nameless Thing (D 125) as part of the resolution of its Forced effect, is that card’s game text active?

A: No. Cards that are attached to Nameless Thing (or Elder Nameless Thing) as a result of triggering its Forced effect are considered attachments with no card title or game text. The only active part of the attached card is its cost.

That'd be awfully tricky though. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

They actually original ruled that the traps would affect the Nameless Things if attached as a result of its forced effect, but then they reversed their ruling and now we have what you quoted from the FAQ.  It's very confusing when you've played with one ruling and then switches to something different.

Yeah, I wasn't trying to be smug or anything, my bad. I originally didn't even think that when the traps were being attached and that their game text might be active the first time I played Foundations, so I guess that one never got me. There's been plenty that have though, lol.

I just completed the quest. 137 points.

 

I had a very lucky run with minimal scrapes. Eowyn/Haldir of Lorien/Denethor. I kept threat level below the nameless thing, and took a few risky moves to push my questing value. Lucked out with 2xSneak Attacks and Gandalf in my opening hand.

That doesn't sound like that good an opening hand for a deck with no Leadership heroes...

Sorry, I should have stated I had the Song of Kings card to give me the Leadership.
