Not so much slow loading, but I always seem to have connection problems that I don't experience in other sites.

It's often very slow, sometimes it takes almost a minute to load the forum.

That's weird, I'm not getting any slowdown at all. Pages load in under a second.

Or not at all...

There are very often hiccups when downloading the pages seems to take forever but if you cancel and retry (once or twice) they usually load quickly.

It has always been slow loading for me. Really irritating.

I have had very noticeable lag time decrease since I have been using OpenDNS servers: 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220 (you need to set them up in your network adapter settings).
