# [Which forum is better for FFG?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283250-which-forum-is-better-for-ffg/)

I've been wondering:

Would moving our discussions to BGG benefit FFG more, since we'd be increasing the "hotness" of LotR LCG, and therefore its visibility to other board gamers?

(Of course, this forum is much prettier, but one can only hope that some day BGG will get a desperately needed makeover!)

A lot of the discussion is over there already, but I don't think FFG or ANA gives twopence for their BGG ratings. I think a lot of new players come here for help and haven't heard of BBG, so there's that, too.

I see, so although the BGG forum might be better for attracting new players, this one might be better for retaining them? 

('cause after all, it's probably the expansions that earn the most money for FFG)

I wouldn't say BGG attracts new players better, unless you mean that other gamers hear about LotR there and try it out.

BGG is how I hear about 90% of the games I buy!  The "hot" forum lists are often a great way to attract my attention.  I'm sure there are others who feel the same way.

That's true for me, too. Good point.

Both places see discussion, both places see new players come and ask questions.  For that reason, both places need to be active, and I think a significant number of people (including myself) follow both this site and posts in the LOTR forums.

In the case of new threads, I generally post my number crunching at BGG, but post about decks I publish at ringsdb here.  I posted about the Solo League on both sites, and I think there are participants from each site who only heard about it on that site.

BGG has worse forum though. This one is so much better organised and designed. A lot cleaner.

I just try to go also to FFG forum (just to try) and I just realize that topic does not go back in top when someone publish in answer in them. It is the worst idea I ever see in a forum. Is there any way to change that? If not I will probably leave it really soon ^^.

I'm not sure what you mean.  If you alter the subject line I think it will put the modified subject at the top of your post, but it won't change the thread title (and it would be very confusing if it did).  I never alter the subject line myself when posting.

I vastly prefer the BGG interface for posting, but I've been there far longer.  Even simple things like quoting and bolding are much easier there for me since the composition is plain text, using plain text markers.

I got a solution: I switch from "recent" topic to "active" topic. Thanks for tying to help me :).

"recent" show the most recent topic. Mean that if a topic with many talk is quite old (like september league) I don't see it because it is low on the page.

"Active" topic is the way we use this forum. And every any other forum I ever heard about.

OMG, thanks!!!!  I've been using BGG for months and never figured out how to get those forums to sort "normally"!  I never thought to click on "Active".

Thanks again!!!

(Man, BGG sure needs a UI overhaul!!!)
