Hi,

 

I have a question on the forced effect of the enemy card "Dead Lord" from "The Lost Realm":

If there is no undead enemy in the discard pile, can I still optionally engage the Dead Lord? Or can I only engage him optionally if I can fulfill all conditions (i.e. if there is an undead enemy in the discard pile)?

 

Thanks in advance for clarifying!

You can still engage him if there's no undead enemy the discard.

 

His ability says: "Forced: After Dead Lord engages you, put the topmost Undead enemy in the discard pile into play engaged with you."

 

If it there was text like on this card "Do X to do Y," then you would need to do X before you were allowed to do Y (because X is worded as the "cost" of the effect).

 

An example of that would be the travel effect on this card:

I don't think enemies are generally worded this way, because they tend to have "Forced" effects (which work like Responses, and trigger after something happens, such as a player engaging the enemy).   Locations on the other hand can have Forced effects or Travel effects, and Travel is like an action, which has a cost that you need to pay before you can travel to that location.

 

Some enemies may have passive text that makes you do something in order to engage it, though.  I can't think of many examples, but I found this one:
