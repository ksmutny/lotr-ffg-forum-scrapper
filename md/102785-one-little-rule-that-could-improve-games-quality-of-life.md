# [One little rule that could improve game&#039;s &quot;quality of life&quot;](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102785-one-little-rule-that-could-improve-games-quality-of-life/)

## 1 [MyNeighbourTrololo on March 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102785-one-little-rule-that-could-improve-games-quality-of-life/?do=findComment&comment=1032844)

You know, I bet in almost every deck there is a card that you wish was there from very beginning. A card that you would mulligan for and get very down if you still couldn't get it.

 

So, I just thought of this little ruling:

 

During setup, search your deck for any 1 card and add it to your hand. Then, shuffle your deck and draw 5 cards. Do the same in case of mulligan.

 

Pretty simple.

This would make the game easier and reward decks that rely on a specific card. Is that really desirable?

It would make it "easier" to some degree, yes, but it's more about comfort, if you can call it that way.

The percentage of "easiness" it would add to the game will be not more than a 5% at best, but it'll prevent those frustrating experiences when you need that card direly only to find all copies of it lying somewhere around the bottom of the deck after you have lost.

 

Some decks just rely on a specific card being played early. It won't prevent an 1000 attack enemy from being revealed on the first turn and bashing your skull, but it'll help your strategy flow and being less dependant on initial card draw. Remember, it's just 1 card.

Lore is there to, among others, manage player draw. If you wanna implement that rule so you only need 1 steward of gondor in your deck for full benefit (barring early encounter cards that remove attachments) then sure, you do that.

As for the argument that it will improve the game´s quality of life, I strongly disagree.

Not every deck has lore. Not every deck can manage lore. There are cards that are vital other than Steward of Gondor. 

 

You strongly disagree, but you bring no arguement on why you do that. That's what I call "constructive".

Well, you're just making Lore and draw card to draw that one card your deck depend on not so important, so Lore will lose a lot, and having just one steward instead of three make recycling card effect much less important too.

Also, it is not for quality of life, quality of life is different than making the game easier. Cards that need to be drawn and deck that are build around such a card is the natural drawback for such powerfull card. If you can have it, then you can deckbuild around something else, the drawback is cancelled and you are left with an umbalanced and overpowered card.

You can even make a 140 cards deck with only one "cards that you need absolutly".

And I don't even want to mention multiplayer, where you can begin with 4 cards that together make an unbelievable combo, and you will get it in the first turn... it's totally breaking the game.

 

Sure, it's fun with underplayed cards, so you can test them. Most people will take Light of Valinor though...

Ok, let's analyse what you have just said:

Lore and card draw loses a lot because you can choose one card to add to your hand at the beginning of the game.

So, you're implying that Lore and card draw effects are only useful until you get this Steward of Gondor?

 

On the note of having 1 Steward instead of 3 - a treachery/shadow effect comes up and you're a happy owner of 0 Stewards of Gondor until the end of the game. Lets pretend game is not filled with attachment-stripping effects or you're just playing a quest with lack of those - you're opening 2 free deck slots(or 1 in case of Steward for most of people), which is not necessairly a bad thing as it adds to your deck's variety. 

 

The main point is not to make game easier, is to give a player something to be sure about, something to depend on. As I said before, game will not become easier more than a little bit. 140 card deck will fail even if you can pick your entire starting hand, because then it'll be uncontrollable chaos.

 

And I will ask you to mention that killer combo of 4 cards that will break a game on turn 1.

(please, don't bring up this famous dwarf-duo deck combo, it breaks the game without any variants)

It sounds trolling post.

 

Why this rule increases the 'quality of life' of the game?

 

You could have said: 'How about with this new rule?', or 'Reached one card first hand mode'..., but 'qualify of life of the game'?

This sounds more like a house rule but it has nothing to do with the health of the game. If you can only win by drawing this one special card or otherwise you would fail then it's time to take a closer look at your deckbuilding. Seems like something went wrong there.

Or when you draw first encounter card. Place it on the bottom if you don't like it and draw another one? Pretty much the same thing. I don't see how it changes the quality. But in essence it is a solo game so you can play it exactly how you want...

Mndela, quality of life is a term used in game industry, nothing trollful here.

 

OnkelZorni, any rule that is not official one is a house rule, lol, so I kinda fail to see the point of this statement. Moving on, whats all the fluff about only being able to win with a special card in your hand at the beginning of the game? Is there really such card around? 

 

Andres1, you didn't built the encounter deck and it has nothing to do with strategy of your deck. Speaking of which, funny, but some quests feature fixed initial stagng area cards, such as spider and old road at mirkwood and hulking troll at anduin, which is sort of the same thing as having 1 card of your wanting in your hand during setup.

This rule sound interesting.  you can take a card what you need in your hand? then is true who will need 3 copies of the cards in the deck? This is  against all selling strategy of FFG…..

 

 Anyway i don't think is a point to talk about it since it will never happen.

 

So i will keep silence…..

alogos already touched on the main issues I was trying to convey. I at least think it was obvious that if you only need to place 1 card-to-rule-them-all (in case it is unique) in the deck then you make room for more cards by loosing the dead weight. I also thought that the steward of gondor example was very clearly only an example, so don´t get so hung up on that one card.

As well it is pretty obvious that if you choose to not play lore then you are electing to drop some aspects of the deck-building in favor of others. Could I by that same token use a heroes willpower or defense as attack value because "not every deck can manage tactics"?

I think all of these things, if not directly implied in my somewhat short answer, then you could easily reach that conclusion by thinking about it just a little. I´ll make a mental note of writing longer answers (maybe with short words) for you in the future but can´t make any promises

"A Short Rest [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/over-hill-and-under-hill/a-short-rest-ohauh] 

Type: Quest 

Encounter Set: None 

Encounter Info: Western Lands, Over the Misty Mountains Grim, Misty Mountain Goblins, The Great Goblin 

Quest Points: 0 

Setup: Shuffle the Over the Misty Mountains Grim and Western Lands encounter sets into one encounter deck and make it the active encounter deck. Then, shuffle the The Great Goblin and Misty Mountain Goblins encounter sets into a second encounter deck and set it aside, inactive.

When Revealed: Each player may search his deck for 1 treasure card and add it to his hand, then shuffle his deck. Advance to stage 2A."

 

Trying with a short answer for you again. Hope you can interpret it but just in case I highlighted the part I think is important.

 

And as for the non-argument that "sometimes the quests puts specific cards into the staging area"; that is part of the game. If you do not like how the game is built then by all means play your little house rule but if you want a sympathetic ear to agree with you, I suggest you don´t beat at people just for disagreeing.

 

Hope you can live by that but if you still feel like crying about the unfairness of it all:

Glorfindel would be even more overpowered if he always started with LoV with 100% certainty. Or with Asfaloth vs locations heavy quests. And of course always having Steward right from the beginning would make games a lot easier than they should normally be.

Ah ok you want to make "that" kind of thread.

 

My original answer was quite civil (if too short for you). However if I see someone being an ass then I can be that as well.

But you do seem to make a point out of making snide remarks to well intended answers (not just to myself); moving constantly at the peripheral of good behavior.

For your argumentation itself I can only say that it is sketchy at best with a kind of "oh but what if I don´t wanna use lore"-answer. Also no-one has said there is an I-Win card but if you know for a fact that you can start with Light of Valinor, Steward of Gondor, Visionary Leadership, Master of the Forge or any other card you could think of then you are at a pretty big advantage in comparison to a regular game. Part of LotR is the luck of the draw; both from player and encounter deck.

And sure, I can repeat myself for a 3rd time: play it the way you like. Just don´t expect an applause for making up a mechanic other people think is broken. For that matter you could mulligan 500 times instead of picking out a specific card but that would also be your own house-rule. I´m not sure if you think that the more people you get to agree with you the more "legal" it becomes for you, in your own eyes.

Part of the reason for my suggestion was that my feeling is that what comes from the encounter deck has more of an impact on the game than what comes from the player deck at least in certain quests... Which can really throw a damper on things at some points... Like that or not.

For me it's not about the impact or making things "easier" (despite all those claims being tossed around, I'm one of few people who wants to see Gandalf erratad to the "When you play Gandalf from your hand", so much for easy stuff), it's about consistency.

I could absolutely see a rule like this to make these victory points a bit more interesting. Instead of just adding the single VP a player could get a reward.

 

The far better rule to improve the (already great) quality of this game would be to allow a mulligan for the first encounter.

Think he means after set up?

In which case it would indeed be a powerful mulligan, knowing what you are looking for to counter those 1st cards.

As the first turn is often the toughest, with the 1st encounter phase coming fast.

Actually, I built a deck based around Trollshaw Scout. I included 3 copies. In the 1st testing game, they all were hidden in the bottom 15 cards of the deck. Maybe this rule will change it.

BUT!!! At least it tested how can it handle things without that one card! And I understood, why is that stupid scout called TROLLshaw scout.

Considering there seems to be no penalty for mulliganing multiple time, so eventually you will get the card(s) you need if you want, I can see how this can save some time and hassle. To make it more fair, make it so you can't grab Unique cards. This will prevent someone from cheesing this by building a deck with just one Steward of Gondor and grabbing it for the starting hand.

Indeed. But some encounter cards are that painful or OP that they ruin the game when you're drawing them at the start of the game. Not sure if that makes any sense for multplayer games though.

After the thread were you tried to mock me after I joined the discussion at a late state for skimming some of the 25+ (none of them small) entries and still ending up with a load of information from all over to sort through. Then refused to recap your point in a small sentence instead of referring to "just read the thread, man" - I just simply can´t take that seriously, mate. Sorry.

 

But if you want to use that as an excuse to not answer any of the points I made, I guess it could be laid out that your PoV must be quiet weak, if you´re not willing to defend it. Should one be so inclined.

By the rules - yes, only once. But technically, if you didn't liked your opening hand - what's preventing you from "resetting" the scenario all over to draw your starting hand and/or mulligan again? Staging area(if it's random) will change too though.

That's what I meant to say, thanks for the clarification. I know on many occasions I would reset the setup if I got a terrible hand (even after mulligan) or the setup was really bad haha. But sometimes I just go with what I'm dealt since I'm getting tired of shuffling all the cards.

Right ok, thought you guys were saying you can mulligan multiple times as per the rules. Yeah I very rarely will do this unless the hand is just atrocious or like you said soullos I've shuffled a million times already and am sick of it. Nine times out of ten though I simply play with the mulligan hand as technically doing another mulligan is a loss (conceding) and you are starting the scenario again...

Not a bad idea for a creative spin on the game. I will never (well, I should 'never' say 'never'), use this possible variant on the game though. I am too much of a rules freak!

In 4 players: one pick wisdom song, other burning brand, the other 2 unexpected courage and we have beregond bunker

Now only problems you have is that enemies can engage other players and more than 3 enemies can egage Beregond.

Beregond has sentinel, so it shouldn't matter who the enemy is engaged with (aside from any special cases I haven't seen yet).

 

You are welcome to disagree with what follows:

 

My personal opinion is that there is already enough consistency in the game since we start with our 3 heroes available. We have the chance to build our deck around these 3 without fear of never drawing them (unless they are imprisoned by the Necromancer!). There truly is no reason when you play by yourself not to mulligan until you see the card you want when playing solo. You can say that you lost all the games where you took more than one mulligan, and no one but you will ever know.

 

In a "tournament" setting, I think that it is more skill-testing not to have this rule. Sure the encounter deck can be randomly lethal early on, but in the long run, it is more interesting to me to see if I can win without seeing the Steward of Gondor or Gandalf in a given game. It makes it all the more enjoyable when that perfect game comes together and I crush a scenario.

Yeah, this idea is awful

The beautiful thing about this game is that you can play any way you want.  If a particular rule modification floats your boat, do it.  It's all good.  It is a game after all.

 

My personal rule mod is that if any heroes die or any players exit the game, the game is lost.  This keeps it more engaging for my friend and me who play together.  I think the heroes are kind of the DNA of your deck and without them, the experience isn't nearly as fulfilling.

 

But hey, to each his own!   :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
