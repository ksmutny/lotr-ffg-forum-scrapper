Glorfindel ally + Sword Thain + Asfaloth.  Too convoluted or worth the effort?

11 resources mainly...., mmmmmh when you reach to play the combo, staging must be plenty of locations yet.

As a exclusive combo i dont see it well, but if you have more sinergy options with other card, then can work.

Works best if you Sneak Attack Glorfindel into play first (if possible).

Good points.  You could sneak him in with Elf Stone or Vilya too, but then it's even more jank.

If you discard him (and 3 other cards) for To the Sea you could play him for 1.

Ally Glorfindel will definitely be worth it. Asfaloth is obviously worth it. The only question therefore is whether making Glorfindel a Sword-thain is worth it. And this is just the general question of whether Sword-thain is worth it, but Glorfindel certainly seems a good candidate. I don't think Sword-thain is worth it if you're only doing it to get Asfaloth on him, but if you want to make him a Sword-thain anyway (and have access to Lore) then including Asfaloth makes perfect sense.

I've honestly yet to be convinced on Sword-Thain outside of the Sneak Attack combo. There it is clearly a benefit as assuming you're planning to Sneak-Thain a 4-6 cost ally you are breaking even (or making a profit) within one resource phase. 

 

Elf-Stone, A Very Good Tale and Timely Aid also make sense, of course--as does To The Sea! now. But those all feel like they would be best used on other targets since those allies would stay on the board anyway. But in the absence of Leadership they would also work well. 

 

If anyone's a great candidate for Sword-Thain, though, it's probably Glorfindel. And if you are Thaning him then why wouldn't you try and slap Asfaloth on him?

 

And the nice thing about Noldor-Discard is that you don't feel that bad putting multiple copies of a unique card in a deck to setup a combo as they become useful as discards.

I've been proxying ally Glorfindel in my Elrond/Gandalf deck that also contains Asfaloth and sometimes Sword-Thain. I've been close to living the dream multiple times.  I'll get Glorfindel on the table and Asfaloth in hand, but then we need the location management NOW...so it goes on Elrond before I can find Sword-Thain.  Or I get impatient and Sword-Thain someone else like Gildor, Gimli, or Faramir...and Glorfindel shows up almost immediately with Asfaloth in tow.  OR I manage to get Glorfindel in play and get Sword-Thain attached to him only to have Asfaloth discarded from hand or my deck or something to keep it from getting into play.

 

I can get 75ish resources of allies onto the table in a single game, but I still haven't managed Glorfindel/Sword-Thain/Asfaloth yet. xD

I would think this combo would work best with Erestor and possibly Cirdan to maximize your chances of getting your combo pieces in hand quickly.

My Cirdan/Erestor deck is drawing a minimum of 5 cards a round. By the fourth turn you have drawn half of your deck, and this doesn't count search effects like Master of the Forge, Galadhrim Minstrel or additional card draw via Elven-light or Daeron's Runes. Noldor combo decks are definitely viable in multiplayer because each player can include a copy of Gather Information (and remember that Silver Harp means you can keep whatever you go searching for, despite Erestor's drawback). The odds that at least one player finds their Gather Information within the first couple of rounds is very good, especially now that we have Galdor hero.
