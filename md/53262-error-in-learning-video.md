Â it might have already been noticed but a few seconds ago i just watch the tutorial again :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]. in the video player 1 commits eowyn to a quest by tapping here, however some how she is ready in the engagement.

did i miss some rule or have i been playing it wrong all this time ?

It might not be the same round. I think the demo just shows what happens during the phases and isn't actually a series of phases in a single round.

If I remember right, she is readied after travelling to Old Forest Road.
