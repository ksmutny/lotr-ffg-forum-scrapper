Hi Folks,

 

played "Into the Pit" and had alle three heroes exhausted at the end of the combat phase. One of them has "Watchful Eyes" attached, which instructs me to reveal and add an encounter card. I do so and add another "Wachtful Eyes" to the staging area. From there it is attached directly to one of my other exhausted heroes.

 

The question is .. do i reveal and add a second encounter card for the second "Watchful Eyes" now? Or do i pass the "end of combat phase" trigger?

You trigger all "beginning/end of" effects at once, then you resolve them in the order you choose. If another "beginning/end of" effect comes into play as a result, it has missed its opportunity to trigger and will have to wait until next round.

More generally, this is true of any response/forced effect: if a card isn't in play at the moment that X happens, then none of the card's response/forced effects trigger off X.

 

Cards in your hand, on the other hand, can respond to X even if they weren't in your hand when X happened.

Do we have any FAQ/rulings references for this?

Had I guessed an answer it would have been to also trigger the new card. My thinking would go:

- Some action/framework-action/event happens,

- We then have a window in which conditional passives effect, then Forced effects, then Responses occur.

- During this window, any card that has it's response condition met by circumstances that occurred during this action window are valid to resolve.

 

Ergo the new card, introduced during the Forced response window of the end-of-round event would have a relevant Forced on it also resolve.

 

That would certainly be the CoC way of doing things.

I originally expected it to work that way too, but received this ruling: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206336-nighttime-in-eriador/#entry2117170 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206336-nighttime-in-eriador/#entry2117170]
