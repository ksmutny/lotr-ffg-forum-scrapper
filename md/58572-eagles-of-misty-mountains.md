So as the card leaves play it is attached... is that correct? So sneak Attacking Decendant of Thorendor for exmaple means it would not go back into your hand.. if you chose to buff that other card? Same for your yard.. the buffing card is essentially exiled?

Yes, until Eagles of Misty Mountains itself leaves play, then its attachments go to the discard pile.

Don't forget that the responce is optional. You may, if you so wish, attach the Eagle character card to Eagles of Misty Mountains.
