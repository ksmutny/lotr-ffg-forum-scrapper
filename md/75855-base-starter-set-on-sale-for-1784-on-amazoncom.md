Just in case anyone is thinking about giving the game a try or needs a second set.  I've been thinking about giving the game a try and this got me off the fence (ordered mine today and it should be here by the weekend). 

Here is the link: http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Of-The-Rings-Card/dp/1589949811/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1355891529&sr=8-1&keywords=fantasy+flight+lord+rings [http://www.amazon.com/Lord-Of-The-Rings-Card/dp/1589949811/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1355891529&sr=8-1&keywords=fantasy+flight+lord+rings]

Thanks for the tip!  Now what do I do with the extra cards now that I have the fill ins?  

Yea, ok 1st world problems, but it seems like a waste to throw it all away.

You can use all the extra cards in multiplayer games.  The rules say that you can have up to three copies of the same card in a deck, which means, if you had enough, you could have let's say… 12 sneak attacks! (4 players, 3 per deck)

can you have six Gandalf in one deck? 3 of each? Or can you only have 3 of any unique character? do 3 max, but you can do two of one and one of the other?

With the exception of Gandalf, I like to run opposite sphere decks.  Example deck 1 tactics and lore, deck 2 leadership and spirit.  When I go with 4 players I like everyone to have a single sphere.  I think it works best cause you can get max resource generation, which allows you to get lots of cards out quick.

3 of any unique - so you can mix and match as long as its 3 max
