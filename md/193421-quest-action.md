Why are some cards labeled with "Quest Action"? I don't understand the purpose. Thanks.

It means that the action can only be triggered during the Quest phase. Similarly other cards say Planning Action, Travel Action, Encounter Action, Combat Action, or Refresh Action. I can't think of a card with a Resource Action, but it's theoretically possible.

Okay! Thanks buddy. Makes complete sense. Sometimes the simple answer is the correct answer. Ha!
