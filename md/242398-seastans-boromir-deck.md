# [Seastan&#039;s Boromir deck](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242398-seastans-boromir-deck/)

So with Heirs of Numenor back in stock, I was able to assemble Seastan's Boromir deck and give it a try. It destroyed Peril in Pelargir even with no allies out and Galadriel being almost useless since you quest with attack (battle keyword). I may have gotten a bit lucky with several enemies coming as shadow cards but overall this deck seems great....almost too great.

I took a break from my Hobbit journey since I had been using that same deck in those same quests for so long. I'll get back to the last two quests there soon and at least I know I can use this Boromir deck and be totally un-thematic if I lose too many times in a row.

I don't really have the time to build my own decks and often rely on the great RingsDB but it can occasionally be difficult because I always seem to be missing one or two cards from a pack I don't have yet. Even in the Boromir deck I had to replace one Dwarven Tomb as I don't have two of them.

Yes it's too strong. So much so that it's boring. When I browse ringsdb I tend to always skip decks that got Steward, Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire. But that's me.

Boromir without Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire for solo nightmare quests can be challenging (solo player decks for nightmare quests without Steward is too tricky, I think).

We've got plenty of resource acceleration outside of Steward nowadays; I play Nightmare solo without it all the time.

Yeah, Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire really seem like they can be overpowered...especially on someone like Boromir or even Aragorn with their readying action.

An exceptionally powerful deck indeed.

But which is the overpowered part of the deck? Fire/Blood, Steward of Gondor, or Boromir himself? Most people say Steward, but I think Blood/Fire is the real culprit here.

Agreed.

I think a lot of people use the deck as the same way as you mewmartigan - basically as a "well, I want to get at least one win against this quest before I start flipping the table" deck. I don't play it much anymore myself, but it does hold a special place in my heart for all the time I spent tuning it.

People like to point out which cards they consider too overpowered, between Boromir, Steward, and Blood/Fire. My own opinion is that they all are.

In a game where Boromir didn't exist, for example, you can get a similar sort of deck by stacking the attachments on a Hobbit with Fast Hitch + Unexpected Courage. Or another deck I have uses Gondorian Fire on Aragorn with Roheryn, and he just kills every enemy before they can even attack. 

In a game without Steward, you can put Resourceful on Boromir and achieve the same deck, although I'd probably use Arwen to guarantee I can play Resourceful on turn 1.

In a game without Steward or Blood/Fire? Well you could build a deck that uses Keeping Count with Boromir and stomp through nightmare quests all the same.

So I don't think there's a single culprit. It just happens that by putting all these cards in one deck you get something spectacular.

I want to see such a deck.

You could also stack Eagles sky-high and give Boromir Support of the Eagles.

I'll post it eventually :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png].

Yeah, that's probably an even better example of how to make a Boromir deck without FireBloodStew.

I've always said that there is no such thing as an OP player card, because most of the encounter decks also have OP cards (Sleeping sentry, masters malice, Card Dum the quest itself, etc.).

Used the deck for Into Ithilien and got my butt kicked the first few times. Too many enemies at once and too much shadow card boosting to 5 or 6 attack per enemy. I don't see how FFG rates this one easier than Peril in Pelargir.  The enemies can be pretty strong and some of the treachery cards are nasty.

Galadriel's mirror has it out for me too, I always seem to either discard the card I just picked or another one that I needed. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I did beat it after a few tries and the deck is still crazy strong.

Man Sleeping Sentry is terrible!

Is this deck still worth playing with the Boromir errata?

I personally always found Vilya decks even better because they are more resilient to everything except dealing with more than 1 enemies on turn one. This is my vilya deck for example: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4880/elrond-gandalf-arwen-undomiel-for-the-strongest-solo-dec-3.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4880/elrond-gandalf-arwen-undomiel-for-the-strongest-solo-dec-3.0]

With the errata I think that there is no use of many equipment anymore. Here is what I may test in the future about Boromir: http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/71232 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/71232]
