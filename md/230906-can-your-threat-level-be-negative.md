Is there an official rule about this? I googled and found nothing (only oppinions, but no one seemed to know for sure...)

This is covered in the FAQ, no value can be reduced below 0:

 

"(1.43) Modifiers of variable quantities

The game state constantly checks and (if necessary)
updates the count of any variable quantity that is being
modified. Any time a new modifier is applied, the
entire quantity is recalculated, considering all active
modifiers.
A quantity cannot be reduced below zero: a card cannot
have “negative” cost, stats, keywords, etc."

Also, the threat level is specifically addressed in latest 1.8 FAQ (the very last item on page 15):
