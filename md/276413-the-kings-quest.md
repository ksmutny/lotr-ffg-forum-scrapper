Holy encounter sets, Batman!

There's new info on the mechanics of the scenario.  Sounds like fun but fiddly setup. 7 encounter sets!

No new info? We got confirmation that there will be a Fire-drake in this box. As someone who was really disappointed last cycle with the lack of creativity in regards to the locale, knowing that this box will in fact include a drake and not just push the encounter for the last pack is huge to me. This piece of news made me consider that this may be my favorite deluxe yet, themewise at least.

Huh!. I totally missed that on my first read through (kinda skipped over the quest card).. Even more psyched for this set now.

I like how the Deep keyword helps with the weak thematic (and mechanical) link of locations. It's like shadow cards for locations!

I absolutely love the theme for this new deluxe expansion. Very relevant to modern times.
