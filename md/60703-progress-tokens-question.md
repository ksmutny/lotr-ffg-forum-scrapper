 So, if after the questing phase, you determine that you can place 5 progress tokens, but the current quest only requires 3 to finish, do you get to place the 2 excess progress tokens on the next quest?  Or do they not carry over the same way locations do?  Thanks for any help on this.

 They do carry over from a location to the quest card, but not from quest card to quest card. 

Example: You quest successfully, having beat the current threat by 9. The active location needs two more quest counters to be defeated, and the current quest card needs 3. You add two to the location, finishing it off, the quest card gets the three that it needs, but the other four go off into the void.
