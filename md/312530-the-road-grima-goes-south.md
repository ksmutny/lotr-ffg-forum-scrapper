Of all the questions asked by the Tolkien community, there is one that still wracks is to this day. We have the answer to ‘Who is Tom Bombadil?’ [“He is.”], ‘Do Balrogs have wings?’ [As physical manifestations of Maiar, they could if they wanted so it makes no difference] and ‘Was the prophecy of the Witch-king’s demise a self-fulfilling one?’ [No.] But the one that yet remains unanswered is ‘What if Grima Wormtongue had joined the Fellowship of the Ring?’ Well fear not, for within I have the answer. Read on, and find that you may once again sleep easy at night, secure in the knowledge you never knew you needed.

Hah, nice. I did a 2-player Grima saga campaign long ago, but we got stuck at Battle of the Pelennor fields. Good luck!

That’s awesome! I weirdly have a special place in my heart got Grima and Saruman because they were the only human heroes amongst a sea of “Name that Orc” commanders in the game boy advance The Third Age awesome LOTR strategy game. So once you do a campaign with your shady human commanders they kind of grow on you.
