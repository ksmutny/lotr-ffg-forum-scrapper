there's a lot of talk going on, to put it nicely, about the game being too easy, banning cards, critics of easy level 4 quest and so on. I think it would be interesting to see just how many people that visit this forum frequently and play the game for the fun of it, that thinks it good as it is in general.

I can start out and say that I think it both easy and challenging in the same time, but love it for the story and flavor more than its beatabillity. And if there's a card or two I don't like whatever the reason, I'll just play less with it.

I am not trying to be an ass or a grammar nazi, but you may want to make a new post.  The word you are looking for is "petition".  A Partition means something else entirely..

I say, unless they are offering cash prizes, screw tournaments. Why bother is my question?

Because it's fun?

Where do I sign if I'm in favor of a partition?

My meta loves this game.  We don't find it to be easy.  We are challenged and have fun each time that we play.

Tournaments for me bring out the worst types of players/decks. All the gamey/cheesy-crap comes out, everyone has cookie-cutter decks. Fun isn't a word I'd use to describe that manure I've seen.
