I have a question about Landroval (SoM 53)

 

The eagle game text read as follow :

Response : After a hero card is destroyed, return Landroval to his owner's hand to put that hero back into play with one damage token on it. (Limit once per game.)

 

I pretty much get the part where the hero dies, do all attached cards go with him into oblivion, i get the return Landroval to his owner's hand thing as well and the put the hero back into play.

 

My concern is about the "Limit once per game" ...

Can you do it :

- once per game per Landroval (ie, i play one copy of the eagle, save a hero from a certain death, play another copy of the eagle, and can pull the hobbitses out of the flaming trees another time)

- once per game per player (ie, i play a copy of Landroval, have him save Frodo from a fiery death on mount doom, then another player put one into play and later save Aragonr's day)

- once per game total (ie, no matter who play Landroval, how much copy he as got or anything else)

- any combination of the above.

 

My first impression would be, once per game total, but i'm known to be wrong from times to times

this was just addressed by nate, it is limited to 1 time per player- regardless of card copies

Good, glad to see I haven't been cheating when I use Stand and Fight on my buddy's Landroval...
