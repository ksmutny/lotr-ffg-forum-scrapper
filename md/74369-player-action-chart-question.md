 6. Combat Phase

All bold characters are in green background, does it mean you can use action window anytime during this phase or just the at the start or end?
• Player actions.
• Deal 1 shadow card to each enemy.
• Next player resolves attacks made by his enemies against him, etc.
• First player resolves attacks made by enemies against him. (See page 18.)
• First player declares and resolves attacks against his enemies. (See page 20.)
• Next player declares and resolves attacks against his enemies, etc.
• Player actions.

At the end of each step (that is in between those steps with bold characters)

i really wish ffg had explained thegreen window more early on in the game……the green windows seem to contradict the actual rules for combat…but i guess in this case the rules override the time chart (as long as you dont take the chart too literally)
