Gurus,

First Question:

"Stand Together" Action: Choose a player. that player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders against each enemy attacking him this phase.

Online faq (1.04) "If a player uses card effects to declare mulitple defenders against a single enemy attack, the defending player must assign all damage from that attack to a single defending character." Assuming from this that you can not combine the defense strength of multiple defenders? So what is the purpose of "stand together"? Is this card only for taking advantage of game text? E.G. "Gondorian Spearman" Response: After Gondorian Spearman is declared as a defender, deal 1 damage to the attacking enemy."

Second Question:

"Feint" Combat Action: Choose an enemy engaged with a player. That enemy can not attack this phase.

If "Feint" is played during first action phase in turn sequence 6 (Combat Phase) then I assume shadow card never flips since it is part of resolving enemy attack and it is simply put in the discard pile?

Third Question:

The three objectives in the Quests "Escape from Dol Guldur" all have "If detached return xyz to the staging area." Are there currently any cards available that would give hero the option to 'detach' the objective after it has outlived its usefulness and the detrimental effects are hampering advancement?

Thank you all in advance for your time and attention.

Peace

I'm pretty sure that with Stand Together the point is to add all the defenses up. If there is any leftover damage then it must be assigned to a single defender. The point would be to completely negate the damage or negate as much of the damage as possible from the defense of multiple defenders.

Your description of how Feint works is accurate.

 

The only think I can think of to detach the objective cards is that they're Restricted.  So if you put two other Restricted attachments on the hero that has them, you could discard the Objectives, and by discarding, would return them to staging.

Allowing the hero to get killed (and optionally resurrecting him using Fortune or Fate) also works!

Question: If a Monster Engaged with you cannot Attack... can you still declare Defenders against it?

I would say No, since Declare Defenders is part of the Monster Attack Cycle, and that never occurs, but I'm not sure that is correct.

Right.  Before you can declare defenders, you have to declare which monster is attacking to start its attack steps.  Since that monster won't attack, you won't declare a defender.
