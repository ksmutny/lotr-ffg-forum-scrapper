Hi,

 

short question about the event card Kleines Ziel (Small Target) [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=2822] - can i use it, when shadowcards are dealt faceup by using the effect of Silberlampe (Silver Lamp) [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=4223] ?

Ok .. another question about "Small Target" .. the wording of the card specifies exactly one shadow card. What about an enemy with 2+ shadow cards?

b) all of them are not allowed to have a shadow effect for using small target?

 

I prefere a)....
