Welcome & Introduction:

Welcome to my fourth Solo Player LOTR LCG Tournament. This week’s tournament takes the next step in a series of tournaments exploring the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.

Note: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].

Will you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!

After the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. Specifically, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].

And now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!

First try today. I don't know if it will hold, but here is the result:

Heroes: Glorfindel, Bilbo, Éowyn

Threat: 23

Hero Wounds: 1

Victory Points: 0

Round Tracker: 90

Total: 114

I think that's a very good result. Haven't even come close to that yet. Might be it's because my deck. sucks. Tried it 4 times, lost 3 games due to some incredible unlucky encounter draws ("Muck Adder" + "Wargs" as shadow effect killed Bilbo in round 1, next game I had 5 locations in a row, with "Brown Lands" being the second; finally I drew "Hill Troll" midgame and then twice "Sacked!")

But hey, I won one game, and it's my personal record:

 

Heroes: Gimli, Legolas, Bilbo

Hero Threat: 24

Hero Damage: 1

Victory Points: 3 (Marsh Adder)

Round Tracker: 120

Result: 142

 Actually I also think it's a good result. I was very lucky with the cards. By the third round I had three Sneaks and one Gandalf in hand, so Gandalf came out every turn the last four turns. I also got an early Steward and a first turn Bee Pastures, so I could get Beorn pretty early whithout too much effort.

## 5 [leptokurt on December 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=571229)

Worked a bit on my deck and changed the heroes. Arogorn replaced Gimli, which led me to a results  of 142, 126 and 169. Then I replaced Aragorn with my old pal Théodred, and right in the first game I got a 108. Sweet!

 

Heroes: Théodred, Legolas, Bilbo

Hero Threat: 28

Hero Damage: 0

Round Marker: 80

Victory Points: 0

Result: 108

 

Key to victory was SoG in round 3 (and getting Grimbeorn right in time). In round 5 I played Gandalf to get my threat below 34. I was then able to get Grimbeorn in round 6 (he already showed up in round 4, so I was prepared) and started my battle with the trolls in that round. Thanks to another Gandalf and Grim Resolve I was able to defeat the first two trolls, Rupert and Louis. I played a "Feint" on Louis to prevent his effect. In round 8 I engaged Morris, not after finally exploring the Carrock. I had to be careful, because I only had Théodred, Legolas (with one Dúndedain Mark), Bilbo, a Dwarven Axe Warrior, a Beekeeper, a Gondorian Spearman and a Mapmaker as my attacking forces (and Grimbeorn, of course). I only had 2 Rivendell Minstrells and a Daughter of the Nimrodel for questing, and Théodred still got one damage point that I wanted to heal. So I only 17 attacking points, and I was also engaged with a Muck Adder which got Wolf Rider as its shadow card (round 8). I lost the Spearman to the Adder and used the Axe Warrior to block the Wolf Rider. Fortunatly I drew another Gandalf in my last turn, so I had enough power to both quest and fight.

 

IIRC, encounters were

round 1: Wargs (undefended + shadow effect; Legolas hit them for 2 danage and the Spearman killed them next round; 3 damage applied to Théodred)

round 2: Goblin Snipers (undefended, killed by Legolas; 2 damage applied to Legolas)

round 3: River Langflood

round 4: Roasted

round 5: Oakwood Grove

round 6: A Frightened Beast

round 7: Roasted

round 8: Muck Adder

round 9: Wolf Rider

I meant his forced effect about Troll enemies: "After this enemy attacks, the defending player must raise his threat by 3". I played "Feint" and prevented him from attacking which is why the forced effect didn't trigger.

 Ah sorry, I just noticed I overread something. I thought you had to fight the first two trolls in the same round. Didn't realize you killed the damaged Rupert with Gandalf and then Louis attacked alone.

 Not a great score, but here it is: 167. 44 threat; 3 damage; 12 rounds.  No victory points.  Heros were eowyn, Gimli, denethor.

## 10 [muemakan on December 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=571333)

 Puh, wow, that´s a though one. Played the whole night while Football was on.

Scored some victories around 120. 

Now finally a good score.

 

Heroes:

Aragorn, Gloin ( no Damage taken......****, Theodred would have been much better) and Beravor

Final threat was 28

Aragorn got 4 wounds

7 rounds played

Total: 102, used 3 core and both APs

 

Realised afterwards if I engaged Louis ( not one of the others ) first and took the 3 threat instead of playing 3 sneak attack Gandalf to kill him in the staging area I could have lowered my threat for an additional 12. Would have took me one more turn. Could have played one more GG.....

So a score of 85 would have been possible........ARGHHHHH

Gleowine and Beravor were a key feature of course.......holding on to 3 sneaks till the end also helped.

Good Night

But just to clarify: This doesn't prevent other attacking Trolls to increase your threat.

@ muemakan:

 

Wow, I didn't ever think that it would be even possible to get a result < 100. Well done, let's see if you can crack the magic number!

Of course. But that's the good thing about taking these trolls out one by one.

Btw, as I completly forgot about this rule when I first played this scenario, players should remember that they can engage only one of the trolls each round if their threat level is lower than 34. No chance to engage two or more of the bunch, even if that's what you wanna do!

 

Oh, and there's a mistake in my scenario description: in round 4 it says that "Roasted" was the encounter, but of course it was "Grimbeorn" instead.

Grimbeorn helps......and I think the key at the moment in this deck for me is to get 5 to 6 cheap allies out and then have cards like Grim Resolve and For Gondor in your hand. And of course a sneak Gandalf its always key.

I swapped Glorfindel for Beravor and changed some other cards in my deck. What a difference! Bilbo + Beravor with 2 UC + Gleowine is a nice card drawing engine. It got me the cards I wanted, and the other cards I could feed to Protector of Lorien. I would have finished one turn earlier if not a Hill Troll had showed up in the very last moment. Gandalf helped me five times this game, and I played Greetings of the Galadhrim twice. However I don't think I would have made it without Grimbeorn, so getting him or Bee Pastures early as an encounter seems really important.   

 

Final score: 96

Heores: Bilbo, Beravor, Eowyn

Threat 20

Round: 8

Damage 0

Victory points: 4

 Nowhere near the top scores, but a little lower: 153.  12 rounds, 39 threat, 6 victory points.  Heros Aragon, Eleanor, eowyn.

## 20 [muemakan on December 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=571511)

 Impressiv, tried it with this combo myself.......but before the tournament started. 

Couldn´t overcome the problem of attack strength.......and resources were a problem too. Never managed to get Steward out before turn 3.

Probably not a top 10, but my first go:

 

1 Core

Won in Round 16 (160)

Threat (45)

Wounds (0)

Victory Pts (-4)

Total 201

Heroes: Aragorn, Theodred, Bilbo

 

Started with a Steward, and I had a few Gandalfs early which were helpful in keeping my threat low. It took 5 turns or so to get Grimbeorn out, so that definitely slowed me down. After taking out one troll and engaging two more, a hill troll came off of the encounter deck, which made things rough. I was luck with Sacked cards though and avoided them until late. Lore of Imladris was really helpful to keep Grimbeorn around and absorbing troll carnage.

Just got to take my first stab at this tonight too...

and while I (hopefully) can do better, this run through was so epic in nature that I just had to make a post.

Heroes: Bilbo, Dúnhere, Aragorn

Threat Tracker: 33

Hero Wounds: 2

Victory Points: 17 (that's -17)

Round Marker: 17 (that's 170)

Final Score: 188

What made this epic will not take too long to tell.

In short, I never did manage to get Grimbeorn into play, but I pressed on... and on my way to carving up the four baddies at the end (thanks to an Aragorn on steroids, swinging for 6 each time), I also managed to take care of 2 (count them, 1, 2) not so measly Hill Trolls and a Marsh Adder (plus Gladden Fields x2 makes 17 VP). Just Wicked!

Phew, I'm exhausted. What fun!

Okay, tried again... still no Grimbeorn, but a less dramatic pathway and somewhat better outcome.

Heroes: Bilbo, Dúnhere, Aragorn

Actually I was wrong, I only played one GG. I used Gandalf three times to lower my threat. When dealing with the first two trolls I used Gandalf to damage them so that I could kill them off with Gandalf, Grimbeorn and Beravor (Beravor had two Marks and got a third at the end of the game). The three last trolls (including the Hill Troll) I could kill off in one go without damaging them beforehand with Gandalf, because then I had already explored Carrock. Actually I would have been able to kill both Rupert and the Hill Troll in the same turn with the help of Eowyn, Henamarth and a Miner, but I needed Eowyn to quest for the progress marker on 2B. I could easily have put it there during one of the previous turns (Eowyn was Protector of Lorien), so that was really a stupid mistake. I think the score would have been 94 in that case.
 
These were my encounters (I am not 100 % sure that the order is correct):
 
1. Bee Pastures
2. Oak-wood Grove
3. Bee Pastures
4. Goblin Sniper
5. River Langflood
6. Muck Adder
7. A Frightened Beast
8. Hill Troll
9. A Frightened Beast

I just realized that I wouldn't have been able to engage both trolls in the same turn, so that wouldn't have been possilble anyway.

You could have discarded Bilbo's "Sacked" card once you defated a troll.

 

I don't understand what you mean with "two shadow cards were drawn" - surely there were more shadow cards in play? One for each toll makes four plus one for the Muck Adder is five. And how could you get both Grimbeorn and Bee Pastures in turn 1?

 Much better today, would have been done a round sooner, but a hill troll came out during the round I thought I would finish the last of the big four off.  Threat: 31; damage: 2; dead Heros: 0; rds: 110; victory points: 7, (gladden fields; hill troll).  Final score: 136.  Heroes, Aragorn; Eowyn; Eleanor.

You can only discard sacked if you defeat a troll........I wash´t sure if this also applies to trolls killed with direct damage, so I didn´t discard it.

Only one troll attacked me in my last turn. The Muck Adder was my last encounter card and did attack me too.....although I noticed if I played GG earlier this turn, Muck Adder didn´t even had to attack me as I would already been on a threat of 15.

I got Bee Pastures as my first encounter card and travels to it......searched for Grimbeorn and put him into play. ( But dindn´t put one token on him in the course of the game.)

Ah, ok. I read it as if you engaged only one troll and killed the others while they were still sleeping.

I think I read somewhere here that an enemy is defeated once he has enough damage markers on him. Should be the same as with locations - they can also be explored while they're in the staging area.

 

Anyway after loosing game after game with a hobbit deck, I tried it the other way around - only the strongest and fittest shall survive! And they did!

 

Heroes: Gimli, Aragorn, Beravor

Hero Threat: 24

Hero Damage: 0

Roundmarker: 80

Victory Points: 3

Result: 101

 

Believe it or not, I played it as a 4-sphere-deck. Had 10 spirit cards, hoping for my only Celebrían's Stone to appear - it never came. But fortunatly I had Protectot of Lórien and could use all those blue cards to boost my willpower. Beravor used her ability A LOT, and Gimli got boosted by 4 HP and 3x Dúndedain Mark. Got all my two Sneaks and two Gandalfs (one in the last round!). Daughter of the Nimrodel healed Gimli just in time. Also had 2x Feint, one was played on Louis. also got 2x For Gondor!, and Steward of Gondor was in my starting hand, which made things of course easier.

 

Encounters:

1. Roasted!

2. Goblin Sniper (engaged and killed next round)

3. Gladden Fields (travelled to)

4. River Langflood (travelled to)

5. Banks of Anduin (travelled to)

6. East Bight (travelled to after exploring the Carrock + leaving 1 progress token on the questcard)

7. Oakwood Grove

8. Oakwood Grove

9. Wargs

 

The last troll, Rupert, had a Misty Mountain Goblin as its shadow card, but thankfully I had played my last Feint on him.

After about 25 tries I ended up getting 82.

 

Heroes used: Beravor, Legolas and Theodred

Threat: 40

Hero Damage: 2

Victory Points: 0

Rounds: 4

 

Encounters:

Sniper

Roasted Slowly

River Langflood

A Frightened Beast

 

My strategy was based on getting the cards necesassry to take out the 4 trolls in one shot as soon as they came out.

 

To do this my main cards needed were:

2 Sneak Attacks, Gandalf, Beorn, Thicket of Spears, 2 Grim Resolves.

These were the main cards used to win, I got Theodred producing 4 resources (with steward) per turn early to be able to take out the big combo later.

When the 4 trolls came out I used Thicket to dodge attacks and then used Beorn's Action and 2 Grim resolves to take them all out.

To play Thicket of Spears you must use ressources from 3 differents heroes, and only one of your heroes produce "tactic ressources", so you can't play this card with your choice of heroes.

I always thought that since it asked for 3 different heroes it meant that one of the heroes had to be tactic and that you had to use heroes of the other two regardless of the sphere....  But ya that makes sense but isn't this card 100% useless then?  You can never use it if you are a 1 or 2 hero team and nobody would ever make a 3 tactic hero team.

 

Back to the drawing board I guess, now I need to replace thicket by 4 meatshields/feints for the same strategy to work.  Not sure if I want to redo an entire run, I was at it all day lol.

Funny thing, I din´t even notice the problem with Thicket of Spears.

But how on earth did you manage to kill them all in one turn. Had a similar approach once but could´t kill more then 3 in one turn.

This would mean you must have explored Carrock and had everybody to fight at the start of the combat phase........

Also you only listed 4 encounter cards.......which means it would only took you 3 rounds to finish this quest. 

And how did you quest for enough willpower to overcome the 8 threat the trolls would contribute and finish the Carrock. You must have quested for 15 willpower?????

I brought in Gandalf and Beorn together with sneak attack and I had 2 Grims which means...

Gandlaf attacks 3 times, Beorn 3 times, Legolas 2 times, Beravor 2 times and Theo 2 times.

12 + 24 + 6 + 4 +4 = 48 damage + gandalf's 4 damage = 52 damage without counting anything else.

The quest is only 1, all I need is for Legolas to participate in 1 kill to complete the quest which is also why I need to have the right setup to kill them as soon as they come out.

 

I don't understand why you say it took 3 rounds?  It's 1 encounter card per round, I was in round 4 when I completed the quest.

But Carrock is the active location at this point and requires 6 progress to clear, which you need to do before you can put progress on the quest. Further, Legolas can't put any progress on it due to its text and don't think Legolas gets to bypass Carrock and put them on the quest either.

Thicket of Spears was a coaster card until the Song of Battle came out, now I include it in my Tactics/Spirit deck.

Just wanted to ask about the Legolas being able to explore the Carrock. Looks like I played it right, thanks for clearing that issue.

 

 

@ Da_Engineer: Welcome! Even if your apporach didn't work due to some rule misunderstandings, it's still a great way to solve this scenario. You could still play 3 Feints (you apparebtly have more than one coreset), suffer one attack and then kill'em all plus one more turn to explore the Carrock (in which you can play Gandalf again to lower your threat. I your example you could have got 81 points.

Muemakan was asked about the number of rounds because you add the10 points at the end of each round (during the refresh phase). You had 4 rounds = 40 points which means you completed 4 rounds, being in the 5th in your last turn. In your example you only had to add 30 points.

Seems while I was busy getting my english together, already two posts addressed some of the problems.

What other allies did you have to fight the trolls, cause your still lacking some 2 attack strength to kill the trolls.

And how did you quest in your last round? Did you have a protector of lorien?

But again, a great way of approaching the scenario.

He didn't have to quest against the trolls because he explored 1B and engaged all the trolls in the following combat.

 

I think Engineer quested with Théodred only, using Beravor's ability to increase his card pool. Legolas killed the Sniper for 2 progress, so he only needed 5 progress in round 4 to accomplish 1B. He had 18 cards of which he used 9. In round 4 he had to send Théodred, boosted with PoL. He had to challenge a threat of 4, so he needed 9 WP to get to stage 2B. He discarded 8 cards and had thus one single card left unused. So potentially there was at most one ally in the game.

So how did he kill the trolls? Say he had a Dwarven Axe Warrior as his ally. He must have attacked Morris first to get rid of his defense bonus. He needed an attack value of 14 to kill him. If he used Gandalf's ability on Morris, he only needed 10 attack points. Gandalf has 4 attack points, Beorn and Legolas both have 3. So Morris was toast and he used Grim Resolve. Now the order of killing the remaining trolls didn't really matter. 13 attack points were needed to kill a troll, now that Morris was gone. However, there is no possible combination that allowed him to kill a troll and add some extra damage on another troll. There's still Beorn's ability though. Say he used that on the third troll, then he only needed Beorn (8 AP), Legolas and one other character to kill the third troll. That leaves Gandalf (4 AP) and one character (2 AP) to eliminate the final troll. That's not enough by far.

So yes, there still should have been a fourth troll left.

I put together a slightly different deck but would like to clarify a few things before even though I took out Legolas.

Doesn't Legolas' ability allow him to put tokens directly on the quest?  It doesn't say location, it says quest?  This is the only reason I took Legolas because I thought he could bypass the location and put tokens on the quest itself, hence saving a round.

For killing all the trolls I don't remember exactly because I played like 25 quick games but I either had a card like blade mastery on Beorn or the Gondor one on all or the +1 to attack attachment or the card that refreshes an ally.

Thanks for the feedback though and saying the strategy was good, makes me want to try agaiin cuz all that work for nothing yesterday kind of turned me off lol.

And your summaries are pretty dead on as to what I did bar a couple things.

If there's an active location tokens go there first. It's adressed somewhere in the rules and I think there's something in the FaQ.

But I am not sure if there's an official ruling on Legolas and The Carock location.

Only thing with your deck is the total luck dependancy.

Seems you can't afford one bad encounter card and your carddraw must be nearly perfect.

Well the only cards I need for sure are 2 sneak attacks, Beorn, Steward, Gandalf and Thicket I think (obviously I now know this doesn't work).

 

I just tried out my new deck, I basically took out the cards I needed to see what's the best score I can get and what cards I need and I was able to get 75 with 5 turns, 37 in threat, 2 damage and a Hill Troll dead.

The cards I need to come out are about the same: 2 sneak attacks, Beorn, Steward, Gandalf and 2 Lore of Imlandris which is really not that bad with Beravor in play.

I replaced Legolas by Gloin.

This one is a lot less luck dependant and it should consistenly get sub 100 imo.

Hi Da_Engineer, I want to echo the Welcome! Glad you're here!

Also, your strategy sounds solid, and I'd like to try something like it myself if I have the chance. I've been way too Grimbeorn dependent. I mean, I love the guy, but sometimes one can't afford to wait around all day just hoping he'll make an appearance.

Anyway, before I post your score to the Top Ten, I just wanted to clarify...

1) Was your last post an actual game or were you explaining a new theory/strategy? (Sorry I'm confused. I just wanted to make sure.)

2) Also, isn't Beorn a Tactics ally? By replacing Legolas for Glóin, did you have a Tactics resource pool available to play Tactics cards? I was thinking your other two heroes were Beravor and Théodred. Am I missing something?

Thanks, and again... Welcome!

 Just wanted to answer a few rules questions that came up in this thread:

Legolas' ability cannot put tokens on the Carrock (it's unclear whether those tokens go on the active quest or if they are simply wasted).

Tokens that get put "on the current quest" get put on the active location first, if there is an active location.  Effects that remove tokens from the current quest remove them from the quest card.  Effects that remove tokens from the active location will not affect the tokens on the quest.

Thicket of spears requires 3 Tactics heroes to use, but a hero with Song of Battle counts as a Tactics hero, so it's maybe not entirely useless.

Hey, thanks for the welcome!

It wasn't an official score, I tested the deck by picking my starting cards (If I get the 6 I need, I'm pretty much set) just to see how good my deck was.  It was a theoretical score. (IMO to figure out if a deck with worth playing, it's good to see the theoretical best score)

Beorn is Tactics but I play Sneak Attack to actually bring him in which is leadership.

I did my first official game with my last deck and got the following:

Heroes: Beravor, Theodred, Gloin

Thread: 48

Rounds: 4

Damage: 4

Victory Points: 0

Total score: 92

I got pretty unlucky with my picks but got good encounter cards:

Grimbeorn, Sniper, Pastures, Freightened, Misty Goblins

 

I'll give it a couple more tries but don't think I will give too many tries.

I just tried out my new deck, I basically took out the cards I needed to see what's the best score I can get and what cards I need and I was able to get 75 with 5 turns, 37 in threat, 2 damage and a Hill Troll dead.

The cards I need to come out are about the same: 2 sneak attacks, Beorn, Steward, Gandalf and 2 Lore of Imlandris which is really not that bad with Beravor in play.

I replaced Legolas by Gloin.

This one is a lot less luck dependant and it should consistenly get sub 100 imo.



 

You mean 4 turns !?! 

What is the Lore of Imladris for?

And how do you get such low threat if you´ll take 12 threat from the 4 trolls that attack you?

And don´t forget you´ll need the Protector of Lorien to quest......I guess...... and the Grim Resolves to deal enough damage and some allies to block the trolls.

 

After reading your posts I tried out my deck which had the beorn-Grim Resolve tactic again......sadly couldn´t get a score under 92.

 Just wanted to answer a few rules questions that came up in this thread:

Legolas' ability cannot put tokens on the Carrock (it's unclear whether those tokens go on the active quest or if they are simply wasted).

Tokens that get put "on the current quest" get put on the active location first, if there is an active location.  Effects that remove tokens from the current quest remove them from the quest card.  Effects that remove tokens from the active location will not affect the tokens on the quest.

Thicket of spears requires 3 Tactics heroes to use, but a hero with Song of Battle counts as a Tactics hero, so it's maybe not entirely useless.



To clarify, in this tourney, we cannot use song of battle as it is not in the appropriate aps.

Muemakan,

As stated before, this was a "fixed" run, it wasn't official, I took the 6 cards I needed to start off.  My best so far with my real runs is 92 (Tried it twice thus far and starting another one now).

you can reduce threat by 15 with 3 gandalfs.

For the needed cards, yes I meant I need protector not Lore.

For blocking I can either muster up 4 allies or get Grimbeorn out.  I just have both options available depending on what cards I draw.

## 54 [leptokurt on December 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57996-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-4-december-25-31-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=572012)

How did you block the four attacking trolls?

 

Either you used Grimbeorn, but then he would be dead afterwards. You would only have had the exact number of resources to play a couple of Grim Resolve. And thus no allies to support your attack (ok, perhaps one lore ally). Enough attacking power to kill three trolls, but there's still one remaining. What happened to him?

 

Or you didn't collect Grimbeorn. In that case you needed 4 allies to block the trolls. That's 4 of your 18 cards. Play SoG, PoL, 2x Sneak Attack, 2x Grim Resolve, Beorn and Gandalf, and you're down to 6 cards. You made one progress in your first turn and had to make the remaining 6 in turn 4. Théodred and Aragorn have combined 3 WP, and you had to face a threat of 5, considering that you didn't engage the Sniper. You thus needed 8 more WP, but only had 6 cards. Even by using Radagast's Cunning you needed 6 WP with only 5 cards left.

 

With "Frightened" you mean "A Frightened Beast ", the card that would have raised your threat by 5? Plus 12 points threat were added by the attacking trolls, makes a threat of 28 + 17 = 45. Plus 4 rounds makes 49. Plus at least on turn were you failed in the quest phase, makes 50+.

 

I hope you don't take offense, but may I ask how long you play this game? Because I have the feeling that you're not 100 percent into the rules. My suggestion would be to give us a more detailed description of your game. Covering only 4.5 turns isn't too hard obviously.

You can save Grimbeorn with 2 Lores or a lore + Daughter of Nimrodel etc.

I don't take offense, I am fairly new to the game, however I don't see how you can state this without knowing the other cards played or that are in the deck?

As stated before.... it was a "fixed" run, I won't really take the time to post it as it doesn't mean anything as it isn't a real run.

Frie, this is about the type of game I have been playing too.  My best score, 136, could have been maybe 10 points +/- higher if it weren't for a hill troll coming out right near the end that I had to kill off too!  But, most of my wins are in the 150-160's range.

Wow! I think I just have missed that grimbeorn can be used to defend against more than one enemy.  Is that correct?  I just thought he didn't exhaust meaning he could turn around and attack.  I didn't realize he could do multiple defenses.  

Then, da_engineer, how did you ready him in attacking so many times during that round?

Daughter can't do anything about Grimbeorn's damage, she can only heal a hero and Grimmy isn't a hero.

Attack Rupert: Beron 9 (dead)



1. The Gladden Fields give you 3 victory points, so your final score would be 70.

2. You can´t heal Grimbeorn with Daughter of the Nimrodel ( only Heroes) but I don´t see why you would have to heal him with her.

3. Rupert wouldn´t be dead if you just attacked him with Gandalf and then with Beorn. He would still have 2 Wounds left.

 

What were the shadow cards for the trolls, nothing painful here?

I think it would made no difference as he stated he played a Lore of Imladris on him which already heals 5 damage.

Yes he can defend against more........but only if they are trolls.

He played 2 Grim Resolves which allowed him to ready all characters.

Yep, some technical mistakes , so no valid score. But the strategy itself works, and Engineer could have won this even without the mistakes. This a score-orientated playstyle though which will loose you most of the games and requires some card-drawing luck, but if you get the stuff you need, wow! And you need more than one coreset obviously, so its not for me, lol.

 

And apparently I am the only one who sees Grimbeorn as a shadowcard at most. Only had him in every 8th game in play. Never in round 1 or 2.

Gandalf is 4 + 1 attack vs 2 +1 defense = 2 damage

Beorn is 8 +1 attack vs 2 +1 defense = 6 damage

 

Yep, your enemies don't exhaust when defending. Quite unfair!

Because this were 2 different attacks you have to subtract the trolls defense every time. So Gandalf deals only 2 Damage and Beorn deals 6 damage.

 

Also it seems you spent 31 resources in your first 4 turns but earned only 30 ( 3 rounds with 8 resources and 1 round with 6). Maybe you just made a mistake in you post.

True but I had more than enough damage left at the end to kill all the trolls.  Not sure this would've changed anything either.

I actually replayed the entire quest and came out to the same result, I could've also damaged Gloin insead of Beravor with the last damage from the sniper to actually get 2 more resources and heal Gloin with the daughter I couldn't use on Grim.

Also unless an actual flaw that would've changed the outcome (where there was no way for me to do something else instead to counteract it) is found, I find it a little sh*tty that this isn't counter, especially with the score I got (Even if you add 5-10 points to the end score for the mistakes its still a great score).  I even made a "mistake" which would've brought down my score by 3 (thanks Muemakan).

I understand that the rules are important but I'm fairly new and if I knew certain things I would've just played that same phase another way which would've came out to the same result, it's the setup that's important, playing the actual phases is really not the hardest part of this game.  I still spent over 10 hours working on my deck and playing to obtain this and I actually wrote down every single thing I did which nobody else did.  Others may have (and probably did) made mistakes which would've changed things but we just assume they didn't and take their scores as is.

Anyway m2c.

I'd too like to cancel a few of the mistakes I did in former games, believe me, but if we don't stick to the rules in a tournament, well, we shouldn't call it a tournament. I think you did a great job in creating that deck and I'm fairly optimistic that you'll get a good result sooner or later.

I'd also wished that everyone would post a more detailed version of their games. Doesn't have to be as detailed as yours (thanks for doing this anyway), but at least the encounter cards and perhaps the played cards should be mentioned, if it's possible to do that.

Oh, and believe it will take a LONG while before you can avoid 99 % of the mistakes. I'm still meeting situations in which I'm not sure what's the right way.

 Actually I don´t know if juicebox will count it or not. As it seems the score didn´t change.......so far from the 3 victory points. I guess we´ll se a score of 70 above my 82 tomorrow.

 

 

Sorry for being so picky, but such absurd good results tend to fascinate and be reviewed by the community quite heavy.

 

It just seems that it´s such a lucky lucky result.

If you think about it: You had only 4 Encounter cards to get Grimebeorn out. 

To get all the resources you need to play all your cards you need the goblins in turn 1, and of course you need the Daughter in turn 1 or 2. ( Actually until the end of turn 4 you spent every resource you had…..if you damaged Gloin instead of Beravor)

And you drew 20 cards until you played your first Grim Resolve………..that´s exactly the cards you played up until then.

So…WOW….. I don´t think anyone of us will ever come close to this.

My score of 82 were fairly easy as I didn´t need Grimbeorn to win and as long I don´t get a Hill Troll in turn one it´s not that of a problem……..but then again I only got 82.

I understand but there's a big difference between making an actual decision mistake and not knowing the right rule which just means you would've done something else instead (which ends up with the same result).

For muemakan, yes of course it's lucky, however, I can get the same result without Grim as my deck has meat shields for this reason.  The only cards I think I need for sure are: Steward, 2 sneaks, Gandalf, Beorn and a grim.  And honestly, the "skill" in this game lies almost entirely in deck making and the strategy needed with this deck.  After this, everything else is luck.  I mean playing cards efficiently during phases is not that difficult.

But I don´t think it is much easier with Grimbeorn. Without him you need 4 meatshilds....wich cost at least 4 resources ( if you get out the 4 possible 1cost allies). But without Grim your lacking attackstrengh so you need at least a For Gondor if your lucky, or some allies.... which of course cost you precious resources too.

And don´t forget you´ll need a protector and some healing for Gloin

So congrats for the win but I think it´s a rather close one which can´t be copied easy.......which of course is good for you.

 

Oh, by the way: Challange accepted.

First of all, let me just say that these tournaments are intended for fun and enjoyment and to explore deck building, the scoring mechanics, different approaches to various quests, and to provide a platform for telling adventure tales.

These tournaments are also competitive by design – they are tournaments, and with that we have to hold to certain standards of in-game play, reporting, and accuracy.

There is no formal referee system. Implied in how this is set up is that everyone be as honest as possible with themselves and with the community. No one is obligated to provide detailed reports of their quests, and if a glaring error is not evident in a reported result, a score will stand. If a mistake is made and realized later during the tournament, I would appreciate for whoever made the mistake to make a post about it so the score could be retracted. However, once a tournament is completed and “in the books” there will be no going back and readjusting scores. At that point, it’s water under the bridge. This whole system relies on everyone doing the best they can over both the short and long haul, including me – the host.

That said, as host, I rely on each participant to submit scores you believe honestly reflect the game you have played. So, specifically, in the Da_Engineer’s case (see above), there has been so much consideration (so many theoretical outcomes for how the game could have gone, posted after the fact) that I feel like I’ve lost clarity around what actually happened during the game itself. To me this starts to sound more like a theoretical game than actual game play. And while theory is fun too, I want to rank scores based on what actually happened. In this context, I think game play matters. Deck building, preparation, and in-game execution all matter. Otherwise, we wouldn't need to even play the game; we could just prepare for it and call it good.

Everyone, even the “experts” here, are on a learning curve with this game, and I hope we can all continue to learn and grow in our understanding and enjoyment of LOTR LCG along the way. I hope the tournaments I host help enhance those things. I hope everyone who participates has fun. I know I’m having fun hosting.

As for the idea of posting to BGG, I think that’s a fantastic idea. While I check BGG often as a resource, I do not have my own account (by choice), and so I would welcome anyone who’s enjoying these tournaments here to post announcements and invitations on the BGG forums (with links to the FFG tournament threads) to come here and join in the tournaments. Thanks!

Thanks for the info, I thought I had to "guess" when I applying cards to make up for the willpower.  This definately helps a lot as well as you don't waste any cards.

I understand but there's a big difference between making an actual decision mistake and not knowing the right rule which just means you would've done something else instead (which ends up with the same result).

For muemakan, yes of course it's lucky, however, I can get the same result without Grim as my deck has meat shields for this reason.  The only cards I think I need for sure are: Steward, 2 sneaks, Gandalf, Beorn and a grim.  And honestly, the "skill" in this game lies almost entirely in deck making and the strategy needed with this deck.  After this, everything else is luck.  I mean playing cards efficiently during phases is not that difficult.

That's not quite true. In each round you have to make decisions about which cards to play, thereby considering most possible encounters. For example, you played Song of Wisdom in round 1, which I wouldn't have done. Why spend that resouce if you don't even know that you'd need a lore card immediatly during the next round? Should  one spare his resources to get Grimbeorn ASAP, or invest a resource just to be able to play DotN, just in case one of the few enemies with 2 attack points should enter the game in round 2? You can play both ways. Your approach apparently is to hope for the best possible encounter card to come, my approach is to cover most of the possible bad encounters that might come.

 

Btw, you have to improve your probability calculations. If your deck should work in they way you planned it, you'd need roughly 1/4 of the cards in your deck. Even if I only consider the six cards you mentined, it's not very likely to get all of them at round 4. I simulated card draws of 18 cards, and in my 47th attempt I finally got all those six cards (but only three 2 resource meat shields). And now I still I only have to get the right encounter cards. I guess that in approx every 100th game you'll be able to play your deck to the max. And that's an optimistic calculation.

I played it because I needed a lore card in round 2 yes or else why would I play this in round 1...

Along the same lines, you keep saying that I need 1/4 my deck which is false, there's some cards I need but it's far from being 1/4.  Just the same as saying that I played Song in round 1 for no reason, without knowing why I did or what my deck has in it, you say that I need 1/4 the cards without knowing what I have in my deck...  Not sure why you need to say this or the purpose of you saying this.

So that was quite a night. It´s around early morning here in Austria and I think I am satisfied for now.

When I came home I sat down and tuned my deck a little bit ( something I wanted to try earlier but feared 3 different spheres could become difficult )

Inspired by Da_Engineers impressive 70, I tried a lower score than my previous 82.

And after 7 tries whith 6 wins and one forfeit after loosing a hero in the first turn, I finally got a better score. ( I had twice the same 82 as before and some in 90s)

So I want to cheek it again in a few hours ( I recorded the session for control purpose). So after I went through the 22 minutes replay I will hopefully  confirm the score tomorrow.

At the moment it looks like I scored a 57. ( 6 rounds, 0 threat and Gladden fields)

For me, I had a chance to do some tweaking myself, and while I'm not quite on the same level, I did see some improvement:

Heroes: Aragorn, Beravor, Biblo

Final Threat: 27

Hero Wounds: 0

Victory Points: 4 (Hill Troll)

Round Marker: 11 (110 points)

Total Score: 133

As we say in my house... poco a poco (little by little).

Ok, finally got an ok score! This quest is hard to get through quickly without crashing and burning when you hit those trolls! Part of my problem is never feeling quite ready to fight the trolls and so delaying some. Then I get trapped by having to wait for some threat reduction and taking longer to get that set up! Kind of frustrating. I don't like having to be such a Boromir player when I'm not naturally. Anyway...

I played with Eowyn, Bilbo, and Gimli

Final threat 29

Damage on Gimli: 4

Victory Points: 4 (Hill Troll)

Round Marker: 12

Total: 149

I can't wait until we have challenges where we're not as limited in our card pool!

But he didn't know that he would be attacked in round 1when he played SoW - so why didn't he play SoW in round 2? Why planning to spent 4 resources at the start of the game if you have no clue what encounters you will draw? The chance to draw an enemy that has 2 attack point is rather slim, as there are only 6 of them in this deck (and one of them has surge). Makes no sense at all to me.

 So I tweaked my deck a little and managed to get a score of 87.

Heroes: Eowyn, Beravor, Bilbo

Final Threat: 21

Hero Wounds: 0

Victory Points: 4 (Hill Troll)

Encounters were:

1. Brown Lands

2. River Langflood

3. East Bight

4. Hill Troll

5. Sacked

6. Goblin Sniper

7. Banks of the Anduin

8. Sacked

I managed without Grimbeorn this time.The key was sneaking out Gandalf six turns in a row (I used Will of the West to get the Sneaks back in the deck). I also played Ever Vigilant a few times on Gandalf so that he could both defend and attack. I played two GG:s and used Gandalf once to lower my threat.

 

 

Bilbo got Sacked twice, but since I killed a troll each turn it didn't matter that much.

Actually, I did try Gimli a couple of times in a Tactics heavy deck that I toyed around with. The part that was fun was using Gimli, as he became a walking TANK! Unfortunately, I was still moving along way too slowly, and I didn't have enough meat shields in my deck to defend as was needed.

67 is still a sick score...

I was playing around with the deckbuilder last night for a couple hours and think I found a way to get a sub 60 score but the cards needed are just too improbable to actually give it a try.

The heroes used would've been Theodred, Aragorn and Glorfindel.

I think with these 3 heroes you can get a pretty good score if you can get Steward and Celebrian on Aragorn and unexpected on Glorfindel but you absolutely need Grim and a few sneaks with gandalf so you need a near perfect draw (without having any card draw heroes) to get sub 60 but you can probably get sub 80 pretty easily with a decent draw.

Sounds interesting, but perhaps Beravor outdoes Glorfindel. I mean she and PoL are a walking WP smash party! There might only be a problem if you want to engage the trolls in round 3 (I guess that's what you're up for?) and your threat is only at 33.

Tried this with a spirit/lore deck... think this was close to the same deck I tried with it back when the Carrock first came out.

Final Threat: 10

Wounds: 1

Rounds: 8

Total: 91 points

 

Lots of Galadhrim's Greetings and Galdalfs for threat reduction.  Two Unexpected Courages and three Dunedain Marks on Dunhere who along with some help from a couple of Westfold Horse Breakers slaughtered the trolls in the staging area.  Song of Kings on Beravor for some Sneak Attack and Steward action. 

 

Will try again.

Will try again.

That's actually a pretty interesting deck, I assume you put 2 Unexpecteds on Dunhere?  Took you 5 turns to kill the trolls?  Only thing is you absolutely need 3 marks and 2-3 Courages or else it'll take forever.  Interesting but seems like it'd be near impossible to crack 80 even if you get the perfect draws.  Blade Mastery would save you at least 1 turn if you could get them played.

 

Muem, where did you see the new scoring system?

I think I did it in four rounds... explored Carrok after 1 turn of it being active with an array of 3 Rivendell Minstrels and Eowyn plus a hangs assortments Radagast's Cunnings and a secret path.  Also Dunhere had some extra attacks (although never more that once on a single Troll) due to the Westfold Horse Breakers.

 

Tried again a couple more times and got a nearly similar result with an extra Gandalf in there for threat reduction.

 

Team: Dunhere, Eowyn, Beravor

Final Threat: 5

Wounds: 1

VP: 0

Rounds: 8

Total: 86 points

 

Got one more idea here to tweek the deck...

Think I'm done.  Tweeked the deck I was playing.  Added For Gondor to the mix which was a nice way to beef up Dunhere attack.

 

Team: Dunhere, Eowyn, Beravor

Final Threat: 23

Wounds: 0

VP: 0

Rounds: 6

Total: 83 points

Could have been 78 but my last turn of the encounter deck (with only 1 Troll remaining) turned up a Wolf Rider and a Muck Adder. Since in order to kill the last troll this turn I needed to engage, sac Gleowine and Sneak Attack Gandalf in to help with the attack I didn't have much to deal with two more monsters (in fact all I had was Beravor with an Unexpected Courage and she needed to attack to kill the troll.) So instead of using Gandalf to reduce the theat as planned I had to use him to deal 4 damage and kill the Muck Adder.

Some awesome stuff was the first turn I engaged the trolls. Dunhere with 3 Dunedain Marks, and 1 Unexpected Courage plus two For Gondors and a sac of a Westfold Horse Breaker = 3 Trolls with 5 damage even with the Carrock still active. Next turn with help of Gandalf and Radagast's Cunning explored the Carrock and For Gondored again along with the sac of another Westfold Horse Breaker for 3 dead Trolls.

I think I'm done with this one.  Muemakan congrads on your score!

Guess this is legal.

So score would be: 65

Heroes: Eowyn, Beravor, Thalin ( 3CS+2APs)

Threat: 5

Wounds: 0

Encounter cards:

1. Banks of the Anduin

2. Bee Pastures

3. Mist Mountain Goblings ( shadow card was Wolfrider) , sneak attack Gandalf Killed one and blocked the other

4. Wolfrider +River Langflood

5. Oak Wood Grove

6. River Langflood

7.Mist Mountain Goblins ( didn´t attack because I was already at 9 threat)

 

The trolls came in Round 5. I engaged Louis which brought me threat at 34. ( to make sure the trolls would attack me in turn 6 ) He was blocked by a Snowborn Scout and killed by sneak Gandalf+Beorn with For Gondor. Gandalf was used to damage one of the stage area trolls.

When it came to questing in round 6 there were only 2 trolls because Stuart was disposed off with Gandalf.

The remaining trolls did kill 2 Snowborn Scouts. And one was killed again with Gandalf and Beorn. The last one was left for round 7.

Again a Snowborn Scout was used to block and attacked with Gandalf. ( he did get the only bad shadow card........2 damage tokens were removed from him)

But as Gandalf did attack him, he got the two damage again. At the end of the combat Phase he was left with 4 wounds. So now I refreshed my heroes and added one threat......and sneaked a Gandalf to kill Morris.

Trollgrats muemakan!

 

Some questions though:

1) How was Gandalf able to dispose Stuart in round 6? The troll could have had only 8 HP damage, if you used Gandalf's ability twice.

2) I guess Thalin got a Song of Kings?

3) How did you get your threat such low? From 34 in the 6th round to 5 in the 7th round seems impossible to me.

4) How many Snowbourn Scouts did you have? I counted 4, but shouldn't there be only 3?

5) To which locations did you travel?

6) I guess you had Protector of Lórien?

7) With Beorn you mean Beorn, not Grimbeorn, right?

8) How could Gandalf and Beorn kill Louis in round 5? Even with "For Gondor"! they only had 9 attack points.

 

I think sneaking Gandalf during the refresh phaseshould be legal, but IMO they shouldn't have made it possible to take actions after the combat phase ends. Was kind of shocked to see that there is indeed a window for player actions at the end of the refresh phase. So, as the refresh phase hasn't been over when Gandalf killed Morris, you didn't have to add the 10 extra points.

 Ugh

 

this one was brutal- going up against 4 angry trolls by yourself seems like a bad plan to me.

Denethor, Beravor, Aragorn - had a couple of Spirit cards in there for anti-shadow/anti-treachery too, but never got Celebrian's stone to play it.

slow in the first part - got steward first round (after several failed attempts where i died slowly with lack of resources) and built up the allies. tried to avoid questing with Beravor for card-draw.

Engaged the trolls in about round 5 or 6. Had 2 Gandalves and a couple of sneak attacks by this point. Still took a long time to whittle away the Trolls - went in order of threat, defence, attack, re-shuffle (can never remember their names) lost lots of allies to chump blocking, but Denethor had Dunedain Warning, Burning Brand, Self-preservation and protector of Lorien, so he was fine to defend 1 per round.

Never saw Grimbeorn - had bee pastures twice as shadows grr.

 

final score - 46 threat - 9 rounds completed, no damage

136

1. He was already damaged to 4 hit points.......shadowcard reduced 2wounds .....so 6 hit points. Gandalf attacked and dealt 2 damage.....4 again. Gandalf killed it.

2. Everybody had a song of kings.

3. 2 GG and 4 times Gandalf.

4. 3 to start with. played them again with ......Stand and Fight.

5. bee pastures and both River Langflood....others were scouted or discarded due to Carrock becoming the active location.

6. Protector on Thalin

7. right

8.Beorns special ability boosts him to 8+4 from Gandalf and 2 from For Gondor.

 

Yeah that´s what I thought. Otherwise they could have just said to tally the rounds when you increase your threat in the refresh phase.

Carrock comes into play as the active location at the time you put the 7 marker on 1B, replacing the current location.

But to get the 7 marker on the quest I did already explore the active location. ( so as it turns out the sentence about a location being discardet due to car rock was falls, sorry)

2 trolls were killed by Gandalf/Beorn combo, one was killed in the staging area ( 3 times Gandalf) and the last one was killed by Gandalf ( 2 damage through attacking and 3 times sneaking. 

 

I would have to look it up again but I think Gandalf came around 11 or 12 times.

 As a tangential question to various comments, I have been wondering, what size decks is everybody using?  The standard minimum of 50 or are people using even bigger decks?  I assume we are all using at least 50 card decks.  I only ever use the minimum but do other people use bigger decks?

Apparently I do something wrong when mixing my cards, because I almost never get all the cards that I need.

 

Muemakan, I still don't see how your game could have happened like you described it. You used 2x GG, 1x Stand and Fight and 1x (at least) Will of the West. That's 8 spirit resources, but you only got 7. And sorry, the probability of sneaking Gandalf three times in one round and then drawing two more Sneak Attacks with Beravor's action is almost nil.

 

And Beorn appearing twice? Has this been another Sneak Attack? Or two? Or did Thalin have the Steward and payed 12 resources to get him into play?

 

It's also hard to believe that you managed to travel to all that locations and had enough cards to discard for Protector of Lórien. I counted roundabout 22 cards that you claimed to have played, and you only had 27 at most

 

I really hope this is a joke, because frankly said, I don't consider this to be even halfway serious.

I think it's an error to have 55, you should always have 50 imo, I don't see any situation where 55 would be necessary because not every card is as good as the next and you're making it harder to get your best cards by having 55.  Just a suggestion.

What I don't find fair in all this is that some people just post scores and they are taken as is and when somebody puts details as to what they did, they are questioned (which is fine) and a mistake or two could be found.

I play a lot of boardgames with people and I can count on my hand the amount of times a game is played without ANY mistakes.  Mistakes will happen and I would bet a lot of money that more than 50% of games played will have at least one mistake in them.  However, the people who post details on their gameplay get penalized for this and others who don't, well... don't.

Anyway, it's not like these games mean anything, it's supposed to be for fun, if people want to cheat so be it.  If people make mistakes, unless it's a HUGE mistake which could not be rectified, it should still count because at least they took the time to post what they did while others who most probably made mistakes didn't.

Anyway Happy New Year, will probably be in bed all day tomorrow after tonight lol, so I will have lots of time to play the next quest (which my deck is already made :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

I really hope this is a joke, because frankly said, I don't consider this to be even halfway serious.



 

It would have to have been one hell of a perfect storm but when I look at it and run the numbers it might be possible... just highly improbably.  For instance I've done some math on the cards needed.  Bare minimum based on what has been said was played requires 31 resources, without Sneak Attacks.  Max I believe is 36 resources.  8 per character for 24 (remember you get resources at the end of the round in the Refresh phase) plus 12 (Steward of Gondor round 2 thru 7, believe its impossible to get it out on round 1 in this build). That leaves 5 resources for Sneak Attacks.

 

Costs:

Beorn x2 = 12

Galadhrim's Greeting x2 = 6

Stand and Fight x1 = 1 (For Snow Born Scout)

Will of the West x1 = 1

Snow Born Scout x3 = 3

Song of Kings x3 = 3

Steward of Gondor x1 = 2

For Gondor x1 = 2

Protector of Lorien x1 = 1

Total = 31 used.

 

Also know that with only 8 spirit resources the last Galadhrim's Greeting must have been played in the round 7 Refresh phase, other wise either Stand and Fight or Will of the West couldn't be played in time to be effective.  That means going into the refresh phase for round 7, 2 spirit resources were saved.  Prior to the Refresh phase of round 7, max resources are 33.  Subtract 2 for the spirit resources and you have 31 resources available for use.  Since the second Galadhrim's Greeting wasn't used yet at this point, only 28 have been used at this point not counting Sneak Attacks.  So going into the round 7 Refresh phase we have 31 resources available for use and 28 used.  This would allow for 3 Sneak Attacks prior to round 7 Refresh?

 

Someone check my math if you care... I think I've logiced that out right but I may have missed a detail 

 

3 Sneak Attacks prior to round 7 Refresh phase and 1 during = 4 Gandalf's.  One was used to damage the Misty Mountain Goblins in round 3.  That leaves 3 for threat reduction.  3 Gandalfs plus 6 Galadhrim's Greeting's = 27 threat reduction.  Starting Threat is 28 with these heroes plus 7 threat for 7 rounds (need to take the threat for round 7 before the action window to play cards in the Refresh Phase opens up) means 35 threat.  35 threat - 27 threat reduction = 8 Threat. 

 

Someone check my mathhere as this seems to indicate threat 5 is unlikely and I may have missed something.  Also in the play description I believe Gandalf did a couple more Sneak Attacks for Damage.

 

Anyways... I started this post thinking possible but improbable and in the process of thinking it through I'm beginning to lean towards unlikely but I'll be the first to admit I don't know if my conclusions above have taken in all the variables.  Really it was just fun mental math.

Muemakan, I still don't see how your game could have happened like you described it. You used 2x GG, 1x Stand and Fight and 1x (at least) Will of the West. That's 8 spirit resources, but you only got 7. And sorry, the probability of sneaking Gandalf three times in one round and then drawing two more Sneak Attacks with Beravor's action is almost nil.

 

And Beorn appearing twice? Has this been another Sneak Attack? Or two? Or did Thalin have the Steward and payed 12 resources to get him into play?

 

It's also hard to believe that you managed to travel to all that locations and had enough cards to discard for Protector of Lórien. I counted roundabout 22 cards that you claimed to have played, and you only had 27 at most

 

I really hope this is a joke, because frankly said, I don't consider this to be even halfway serious.



I had basicaly my whole deck in hand in round 5.

Did I wrongly mention Stand and Fight, if so I apologize. Beorn and Gandalf were sneaked.

To sneak Gandalf 5 times in one turn you need only one resource in phase one.

Beravor can draw 8 cards. ( 3UC)

As I am typing this on my phone it' s quite awful to elaborate.

I will try to get all questions answered tomorrow.

My deck for this was designed as a card draw deck.

Sneaking somebody is totally free as long as you have the resorces for a sneakattack at firs.

Horn of Gondor saves a lot of resources.

Happy New Year.

 Yay, I finally scored!  And yes, I finished my game and got my score before midnight (it's 11:13 here).  But first, let me just say that I have the ABC New Year's special on right now, and Lady Gaga is the stupidest person/idea/concept/thing to have ever happened to civilization.  I'm ashamed for the human race for encouraging and celebrating something that brainless.

Heh, ok, back to this card game.  I scored 123!  

Heroes: Aragorn, Eowyn, Frodo Baggins

Threat: 32

Hero Damage: 5

Dead Hero Cost: 0

Round Tracker: 90

V.P.s: 4

TOTAL: 123

I quested through to phase two on round 4, then fought off the trolls one at a time from there.  My threat was only about 22 at the time, so I chose to engage the nasty Hill Troll last, which I pulled off the encounter deck in round 4.  Didn't ever pull a Sacked card.  Had SoG and Celebrian's Stone in my opening draw which helped tons.  

This was the third try with this deck.  I lost on the previous 2 tries.  I also tried an all Tactics deck 3 times, which failed miserably each time.  And I played 4 or 5 games with a Spirit/Lore deck which lost every time.  I'm just happy to finally get a win.  This was my first time trying this quest solo.  Congrats to everyone else who has scored those insanely low scores.

Oh, AND I was only playing with one core set and the two XP packs.  Pretty respectable score I think.

HAPPY NEW YEAR!!! Congrats to all, and well done on another Solo Player Tournament!

I want to thank everyone for playing. It was a pretty wild and raucous week. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

A special thanks to Louis, Morris, Stuart, and Rupert... you four really took (and at times dished out) quite a beating!

Much appreciation to everyone who participated for the lively gaming, discussion, competition, and fun. Good stuff!

And thanks also to folks like radiskull and Dam for enhancing our experience by making your presence known and sharing your thoughts about various ruling questions that came up along the way. Your additions to the tournament were enjoyed and appreciated (and let me just say out loud that you're both welcome to jump in the tournament "playing" end of the pool anytime you like as well... for as always, the more the merrier happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]).

The Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954] will be updated soon. January promises to hold a lot more Shadows of Mirkwood action.

Happy 2012,

juicebox

I think it's an error to have 55, you should always have 50 imo, I don't see any situation where 55 would be necessary because not every card is as good as the next and you're making it harder to get your best cards by having 55.  Just a suggestion.

Then again, I have 2 Core Sets split into four decks that initially used all 12 Core Heroes (Thalin has since made way for Brand, other 11 are still the Core heroes), so they are by no means min-maxed to the fullest. Still, only have a losing record against Return to Mirkwood (though Dol Guldur is next on the to-play list), so not sure why they don't work as built.

The difference is that players in this tournament build their deck against a specific scenario, while you have a deck that is meant to defat them all. Which of course requires a lot of special cards, especially Rhosgobel.

I really hope this is a joke, because frankly said, I don't consider this to be even halfway serious.

 

 

What I don't find fair in all this is that some people just post scores and they are taken as is and when somebody puts details as to what they did, they are questioned (which is fine) and a mistake or two could be found.

I play a lot of boardgames with people and I can count on my hand the amount of times a game is played without ANY mistakes.  Mistakes will happen and I would bet a lot of money that more than 50% of games played will have at least one mistake in them.  However, the people who post details on their gameplay get penalized for this and others who don't, well... don't.

Anyway, it's not like these games mean anything, it's supposed to be for fun, if people want to cheat so be it.  If people make mistakes, unless it's a HUGE mistake which could not be rectified, it should still count because at least they took the time to post what they did while others who most probably made mistakes didn't.

My2Cents

Anyway Happy New Year, will probably be in bed all day tomorrow after tonight lol, so I will have lots of time to play the next quest (which my deck is already made :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].



It would be even more unfair not to mention mistakes.  I know it sucks that some (not even all) of your results have been cancelled, but OTOH you improved your playing skills by learning new rules and avoiding the mistakes made. There's also a big difference between unintentional mistakes and mistakes that you know about. There's als a difference between games with an average result and games with an excellent result.

I would have to look it up again but I think Gandalf came around 11 or 12 times.

 

 

How on earth is that even possible????

 

 

You can sneak him 5 times in one turn if you get the card draw possibilities and can reshuffle you deck.

 

 

 

So you drew your whole deck and then some in 7 turns without Spirit as a starting resource?   angel.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angel.gif]



 

I had Eowyn ( as a starting hero)  to get spirit resources. And she also had a Steward of Gondor on her.......so there were plenty spirit resources.

I had 48 cards in turn 5. ( so basically nearly all of my 50 cards).

I had a SoF on Eowyn and a Horn of Gondor and a Song of Kings......so she had plenty of resources. 

At the end  I had 3 UC out.......so with Beravor  I could draw 8 cards. So reshuffling and drawing 2 sneaks again is not that hard. Oh and don´t forget the one card Gleowine can contribute.

Beorn was sneaked.....so it´s not that hard to appear twice. 

As I looked up just now I traveled to the Banks of Anduin, Bee Pastures were scouted, the first Langflood was discard due to Carrock becoming the active location, Oak Wood Grove was scouted and the last River was left in the staging Area.

I just had to discard 3 cads to Eowyn. In round 2 I had to discard one card to put 2 progress tokens on the Banks of Anduin. Again in round 3 to get rid of the Banks. And then in round 4 to don´t sufer the one threat.

I did have to discard 8 cards for the PoL to complete Stage 1.

And at the end in round 7 I had to quest for 11. Which was quite easy as I could afford to discard nearly all of my deck.

This wash´t a joke and very serious. But I don´t mind asking........I feel the same when I read some results of others players myself.

It would have to have been one hell of a perfect storm but when I look at it and run the numbers it might be possible... just highly improbably.  For instance I've done some math on the cards needed.  Bare minimum based on what has been said was played requires 31 resources, without Sneak Attacks.  Max I believe is 36 resources.  8 per character for 24 (remember you get resources at the end of the round in the Refresh phase) plus 12 (Steward of Gondor round 2 thru 7, believe its impossible to get it out on round 1 in this build). That leaves 5 resources for Sneak Attacks.

 

Costs:

Beorn x2 = 12

Galadhrim's Greeting x2 = 6

Stand and Fight x1 = 1 (For Snow Born Scout)

Will of the West x1 = 1

Snow Born Scout x3 = 3

Song of Kings x3 = 3

Steward of Gondor x1 = 2

For Gondor x1 = 2

Protector of Lorien x1 = 1

Total = 31 used.

 

Also know that with only 8 spirit resources the last Galadhrim's Greeting must have been played in the round 7 Refresh phase, other wise either Stand and Fight or Will of the West couldn't be played in time to be effective.  That means going into the refresh phase for round 7, 2 spirit resources were saved.  Prior to the Refresh phase of round 7, max resources are 33.  Subtract 2 for the spirit resources and you have 31 resources available for use.  Since the second Galadhrim's Greeting wasn't used yet at this point, only 28 have been used at this point not counting Sneak Attacks.  So going into the round 7 Refresh phase we have 31 resources available for use and 28 used.  This would allow for 3 Sneak Attacks prior to round 7 Refresh?

 

Someone check my math if you care... I think I've logiced that out right but I may have missed a detail 

 

3 Sneak Attacks prior to round 7 Refresh phase and 1 during = 4 Gandalf's.  One was used to damage the Misty Mountain Goblins in round 3.  That leaves 3 for threat reduction.  3 Gandalfs plus 6 Galadhrim's Greeting's = 27 threat reduction.  Starting Threat is 28 with these heroes plus 7 threat for 7 rounds (need to take the threat for round 7 before the action window to play cards in the Refresh Phase opens up) means 35 threat.  35 threat - 27 threat reduction = 8 Threat. 

 

Someone check my mathhere as this seems to indicate threat 5 is unlikely and I may have missed something.  Also in the play description I believe Gandalf did a couple more Sneak Attacks for Damage.

 

Anyways... I started this post thinking possible but improbable and in the process of thinking it through I'm beginning to lean towards unlikely but I'll be the first to admit I don't know if my conclusions above have taken in all the variables.  Really it was just fun mental math.

Beorn did cost nothing, as did every Gandalf that was sneaked, thanks to Horn of Gondor. I just need the resource to play it and at the end the one resource comes back to Eowyn.  This counts too for every Snowbourn Scout I played, because they all dead sooner or later. SoG is also free as he produces the resources he costs.

The GG did indeed cost 6 resources.  so from your above list only 13 resources remain. 

As I know now by looking at my video again I did draw 3 cards with my firs Gandalf and didn´t kill the Goblins......they were killed by Gandalf with an attack.

Gandalf was used 5 times for threat reduction along with 2 GG. 42 threat-37 threat leaves 5.

7 rounds, 3 from the attack of louis, and 4 from questing in round 7.........14+28= 42 threat.

Ya you need to rebuild each deck each time you face a different quest if you want to have the best possible outcome.  IMO building a new deck each deck is not only really fun but is where most of the skill comes in, (Even though some people don't think so) if not the majority of skill.  Look at what the quest needs, does it need a spur of willpower or does it not a decent amount each turn?  Does it need a spur of damage, or just a small amount each turn, or none? etc etc.  Once you figure that part out then you look at your possible cards on: http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-deckbuilder [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-deckbuilder] which is a great tool for deckbuilding.  Anyway, I actually like better deck building than actually playing because I find it more challenging, you should know what your outcome should be (or close to) when you start playing afterwards.

Good luck.

Deducting the initial 6+1 cards, getting 40 in 5 turns requires 8 cards per turn. But on turn one, you can have max 1 UC on Beravor I think (with Spirit Song you can just play it). Even with that UC, getting both of the other two UC by turn 2 seems fortuitous (drawing 2+2+1 cards total).

I would say building a generic deck that can handle all the quests, you have to take much more into account than when building for a single quest. While in single quest building, you can cherry-pick your key cards targetting each scenario fully (dumping healing and ranged when not playing Rhosgobel, etc.), less skill required IMO than if you're building decks that are meant to take 10 different quests (3 Core, 6 Mirkwood and Osgiliath) and perform.

I didn't say building a generic deck doesn't take skill, I said building decks requires skill.  I have a generic deck along with a deck that I build for each quest as well.  There's just as much skill needed for each, only thing is building a generic deck takes longer as you're pretty much putting all 50 cards to use.  I wouldn't say building a generic one takes more skill because you're removing the quest variable.  The quest is like a mathematical problem, by deduction, logic and calculations you are solving the quest with the use of all the cards at your disposal whereas in a generic deck you are finding which cards work best together for no particular objective.

I can´t use a spirit song due to the deck building restrictions.

On turn one 4 cards were drawn with Beravor ( Common Cause ) ...so 11 cards total.

In turn two I had Gleowine and my first UC and one more Common Cause.....so 19 cards total

In turn three I played a Westfold Horsebraker and 3 cards came due to gandalf also 4 cards because 2 Valiant Sacrifice were played on a dead  Scout ....so 34 cards total.

In turn four I played another Horsebraker ( with Valiant Sacrifie )and UC and Common Cause......so 48 cards total. 

n turn five I had 48 cards drawn so far.............not very lucky or difficult to do that.
