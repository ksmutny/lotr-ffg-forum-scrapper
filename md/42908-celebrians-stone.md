Anyone else noticed the little circle near the name of this card? It's the same as the circle on a Hero's card which signifies you can only have one in play.

Would make sense that artifacts are limited to one per game in any deck?

If this is the case though, wonder how they will handle this in expansions which are supposed to be 3 of each card? Maybe you'll get 3 unique artifacts in some expansions?

Well, having three The One Ring out at the same time would kinda go against the theme and lore, no gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] ? Is LotR going further than CoC and W:I in this sense? In those two, both players can have the same unique card out, but neither can have two copies of the unique out at the same time. Is LotR one unique period? Meccg had one unique period, so no duplicate characters, no unique items, no factions, etc. which was the way it should be IMO.

yes this is how the current LCG's work, and unless this game's deckbuilding restrictions are different just because you can have only one in play does not mean that you can't have 3 in your deck.

Exactly. The point of having several copies of a unique card in your deck is to

a) improve the chance of drawing it

b) have a chance to replace it after it left play

Why do you think there will be three copies of each card in the adventure packs?

The update on adventure packs said that "These fixed 60 card decks include a new Hero, three copies of nine unique player cards, and the Encounter and Quest cards devoted to the included scenario". The will only be one Hero card and one of each Quest card. As there is 60 cards in each pack, we may assume that there will be one of each of two other cards as well.

"three copies of nine unique player cards"

It's the nine unique player cards where the artifacts would be included.

I just picked up MECCG again. It's so good. A one per deck or M:TG legendary rule concerning uniques would be wild in this game. I can't say I'd be against it.

As far as I remember, the unique cards CAN be included in the deck 3 times. But they can only be in play once. And in contrast to WHI or AGOT, where everyone could play the same unique cards, the cards are unique game-wide. So if I play Celbrian's Stone, no other player can have it in play.

I think that's the right decision, and if players want to house rule that there can only be one unique card in the whole deck, for more thematic reasons, they can agree to do that, because it's co-operative. Assuming they have enough other cards to provide them with a whole deck still, obviously. Not sure that would be neccessary though

 I think that the "one copy in play" rule makes sense for a co-operative card game. It also adds an extra layer of strategy, which player would contribute most to our victory by having this card attached to a hero? Good stuff.
