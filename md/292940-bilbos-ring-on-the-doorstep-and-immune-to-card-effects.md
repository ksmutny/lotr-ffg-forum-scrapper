Can I exhaust Bilbos Ring to cancel all damage from a card that is immune to player card effects? e.g. Smaug & Bolg.

I've been playing it that it does cancel - I'm not targeting the enemy card - I'm just wiping damage done to my card.

Yes, you can cancel damage that was created by an immune enemy.
