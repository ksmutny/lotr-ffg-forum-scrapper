1.If Minas Tirith is not in play,but City Wall [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/lord-of-the-rings-saga-expansions/the-flame-of-the-west/city-wall-r1931] it is I must still assign damage to it?

2.When Mordor Orc attacks what happens?I must take the attack undefended and damage a hero and Minas Tirith or just Minas Tirith?Or maybe I can defend the attack and no damage will go on the city?Or damage are puted on Minas Tirith even if I defend.The same question for Regiments of crows.

3.I may put progress on the third stage of Battle of the Pelleanor Fields with Ravens of the Mountains?

4.If I use Eowyn to reduce my threat by 3(now is 26) in setup,then I rise it by 3 (now is 29)for resources (in Passing quest),What is my minimum threat at stage 2(26 or 29)?

5.If there is no Witch-King in play I can't travel to Grond?

6.If I use the Helm!Helm! on a War Mumak I will gain the threat reduction?

7.If i reveal a card with surge,I first resolve all the card and then the surge?

8.If Witch-King has a  Fell Beast Attached when he is removed from play by stage 4,he keeps it so at stage 5 he will have 2 attached?

9.Can someone give me synonims for Brace word on the  Brace of Coneys boon?

Thank you!
