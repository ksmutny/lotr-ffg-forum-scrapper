## 1 [tamtamnoob on May 31, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84554-3-question-to-clarify/?do=findComment&comment=800582)

i am currently playing 2 player game

1)  When there is only one enemy and a few other location card at the staging area , i used the engagement check and the enemy has higher threat than me. So , am i  forced to fight the enemy which i wanted to avoid  it or the engagement check is pass to the next player?

2) When an enemy is undefeated , after the combat phrase , do we discard the shadow card or it stay with the undefeated enemy?

3) i am blocking an enemy attack , the creature reveal its shadow card, there is a shadow effect , So , can the other player use its event card such as hasty stroke to remove the shadow effect on that shadow card when i am currently trying to block the enemy attack??

Thanks for the answer!!!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

1.if your threat is lower than an enemy it doesnt engage you in the engagement check…if there are no other enemies the next player checks their threat against the enemy

2.you discard the shadow cards at the end of the combat phase

3.yes, that is fine

hope that helps
