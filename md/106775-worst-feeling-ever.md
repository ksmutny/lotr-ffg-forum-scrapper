You know when your playing a game and your slowly seeing your Fellowship's demise, and yet your heroes are sitting on a ton of resources but you can't spend any of them because you just aren't drawing the right cards? Worst feeling ever! Elrond had 6 resources, Glorifindel 4, and Legolas 2 and I still got destroyed! Aaaahhhhhhh!

That's all.

That's only happened once for me. Generally if I have those kinds of resources, I'm pretty well off and there isn't much the encounter deck can do about it.

I needed allies.

I actually had a sort of opposite experience last night.

Soloed Conflict at the Carrock on nightmare and just managed to pull through at the last moment with one dead hero and a threat of 49.

Sort of happened to me. We won that games, but I was piling hella load of resources I just couldn't spend.

(I had a hero with Horn of Gondor in a 4 player game)

Well, tactic could have a hero that go in your deck, or the deck of an other player and put the first ally on the top of his deck after shuffling it. Would be nice. (with a condition like upon killing, once per turn).

During a solo Passage of Mirkwood game, I decided to give Aragorn the Steward of Gondor to buy anything that came into my hand.The idea worked well, and I felt I had the game in hand. I steamrolled Ungoliant's Spawn and had amassed an army going into the second stage. On the random draw, I drew the path that required me to kill Ungoliant's Spawn. According to the rules, killing him before didn't count. I spent the next few turns forcing a reshuffle of the encounter deck. I never saw Ungoliant's Spawn again, and had to resort to using dice to keep track of all the resources. I ran out of counters a few turns before hitting 50 threat.

 

Aragorn was rich beyond belief, but those riches didn't bring Ungoliant back fast enough. Sigh.

The quest card that requires you to kill Ungoliant's Spawn says this:

 

> When Revealed: Each player must search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 Spider card of his choice, and add it to the staging area. The players must find and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn to win this game.

 

Why didn't you just search for Ungoliant's Spawn in the discard pile?

Because I didn't realize you could. It was a looooooooong time ago and I wasn't as well versed as I am now. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

2 gamers: 1 have a lot of cards but no resources; the another tones of resources but no cards in hand :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] .

 

 

PD: but the most thing i hate is a silly player with Elrond-Vilya making failures one behing one...
