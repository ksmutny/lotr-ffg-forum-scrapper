# [Vilya + X cost cards](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135580-vilya-x-cost-cards/)

Hi all,

 

I was wondering how Vilya responds to X cost cards. Can you play them for any cost X? For example,

Vilya.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Shadow-and-Flame/Vilya.png]                       Stand-and-Fight.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Stand-and-Fight.png]

 

Could I play stand and fight by Vilya to return the Beorn ally of cost 6? Or is it revealed as X equal to 0, which would make it complete useless since the only 0 cost allies have to be released yet.

The latter appears to be correct (http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/73055-elrond-vilya/?hl=vilya [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/73055-elrond-vilya/?hl=vilya]). This seems logical/reasonable to me.

 

The FAQ states the following:

 

(1.40) The letter X
Unless specified by a card effect, or granted player
choice, the letter "X" is equal to 0.
 
But… perhaps you could pay 6 Resources to put Beorn into play from your discard pile when Vilya puts Stand and Fight into play? That's the only way I could see it working. 
 
I could be wrong, and I'm sure wiser/more experienced players will chime in.

I knew the letter X equals 0 in most cases, but the "granted player choice" makes it confusing to me. Since If i get the choice of playing an ally of cost X by the event, X would be specified and thereby 6. So therefor this question arose....

Looks like this topic has come up a few times before.  Most people think it would be 0, but I haven't seen an official answer from Caleb.  At this point I'd recommend just asking him.

I play Vilya with Gandalf's search by giving X the value X = the number of cards I'll look in me deck until I find wath I'm looking for and then rearranging my deck like I want which is AWESOME. That's how I understand the 1.40 rule from the FAQ.

This card also came to my mind when I asked this question, because it would imply I can choose 50 and by consequence reorder my complete deck for the game.....

I've been playing Elrond + Vilya since it came out, I absolutely love the deck, so I've asked a lot of questions around it. This situatuon 100% winds up being playing X cards for 0. I have the answer from Caleb somewhere in my emails, I'll check when I get home.

If Caleb clarified it, then... x = 0! It was too good to be true...

Thanks for your input!

Just to follow up:

I'm afraid in the situation you just described, the value of X is always 0. So you could play Gandalf's Search for 0 cards, or Men of the West to get 0 Outlands characters back in your hand, etc. If that's not already in the FAQ, then it should be.

I'll make a note to check.

Cheers,

Caleb

I couldn't find the question I asked, but this was on BGG.
