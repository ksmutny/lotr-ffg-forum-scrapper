Does anyone know how to tell if the Adventure Pack contains updated text and errata rules? In other words: is there any visible clues on the package itself to check before I buy it? (like for the updated Redhorn Gate to get the correctly spelled Elrohir "response" as well as easy mode rings).[/size]
 
I am interested in buying the updated Core set as well, but want to make sure I don't get an older copy...

Here is a link [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LotR-FAQ.pdf] to the most recently updated card errata and rule conent for every adventure pack and expansion.

He asked how to differ products that contain erratad cards from ones that don't, why are you giving him the link to pdf?

 

I would look at the date.

there are no cards with updated text and there probably never will be. Only a few packs in any other lcg are fixed in this way. Gekoth has a thread at BGG where he has recreated the cards you can print out at artscow or somthing if you want.

I also think there will be no update. Just look a FAQ and if you don't really care dont bother yourself at all

Actually, my copies of Mirkwood Cycle APs, KD Deluxe, Redhorn Gate, and Hobbit OHaUH all have the FAQ wordings and/or the Easy Mode indicator for the encounter decks.

 

Sadly I ordered these online so I don't have a quick way to compare the packaging. It seems that the package says the same years as the sets were released originally, though they were clearly from the recent reprints. There is nothing about 2nd print run, etc anywhere that I've noticed.

I found the answer to my own question from the Grey Company guys on facebook.

 

Actually guys, they have indeed reprinted the cards fixing them and putting the easy mode markers on the encounter cards (you can see this on the Grey Company guys facebook page). To see if the pack you are buying has the updated cards, with corrections and errata, you just look at the barcode on the bottom of the packaging. There is a date for the printing year and month. If the pack has a more recent date (like late 2013 and early 2014), then it will include the updated cards.

Thanks for passing on that information about the barcode. Whenever possible, I'll go for the reprints. I don't mind errata as a rule of thumb, but it takes long enough to explain to other new players what's going on in this game without telling them the card's text isn't right anymore.

Sorry to resurrect an old thread. I was wndering the same thing. My The Hunt for Gollum (1961dec13) and Conflict at the Carrock (1961dec13) both have the easy mode indicator and encounter set number under the encounter set icon set icon. My THFG even have the updated The River Ninglor image.

 

My A Journey to Rhosbogel (1690jun13) doesn't have the easy mode indicator.

 

In my case the date stamp didn't revealed anything since they all were reprinted in 2013. The copyright is different tough. The sets that were reprinted have the copyright that starts that way: ''@ 2011 Fantasy Flight Publishing Inc.''... while the AJTR has copyright that starts like that: The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game - A Journeu to Rhosbogel @ 2011 Fantasy Flight Publishing inc.''...

So there is such a thing as an updated core set?

Yes, the most recent update to the core set presumably (though I haven't seen it) will include the easy mode marking.
