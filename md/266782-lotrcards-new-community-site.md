Hey guys, wanted to make sure some word was spread here about the new community site we've got up and running. Hoping that it can be a good resource, particularly helping give people a good way to submit their local events and make them more easily discoverable by others.

There's quite a bit of other good stuff though, so check out the linked intro post for more information.
