I will do a drawing on Monday January 28th for the adventure pack:Fire in the Night!

All you have to do is tell me what hero I thought was the best defender for Dagnir, he only has one weakness (one of the side quests) 

Listen to The Mouth of Sauron Podcast episode 21 Fire in the Night, and respond via my webpage www.themouthofsauron.com!

 

Good luck and happy questing!
