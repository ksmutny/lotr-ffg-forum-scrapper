 Sorry if this has been answered already, but if your Willpower is equal to the Threat when you quest - are you considered to have quested successfully, or unsuccessfully, (or neither)?

In some quests like HfG it becomes important to know.

thanks

This is covered in the FAQ v1.2, rule 1.24: questing succesfully means your Willpower is greater than the total Threat in the staging area.
