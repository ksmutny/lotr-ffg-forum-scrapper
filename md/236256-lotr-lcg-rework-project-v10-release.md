# [LotR LCG Rework Project v1.0 Release](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/)

## 1 [John Constantine on December 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/?do=findComment&comment=2527928)

So... yeah, hi! It's me again. And I've reached the point in my project where I'm comfortable with calling a version 1.0, therefor making it kinda full release.

 

What is this?

This is a project where I try to overhaul old cards that I find obsolete/overpowered/outdated, etc. The aim is to bring the balance and prosperity to all the cards, while keeping them interesting, viable, and doing my best to stick to their original feel.

 

Don't let me bore you with too many words just yet, there is plenty of card text ahead :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Don't forget that Lorefindel now heals for free.

I don't see any difference in Prince Imrahil (leadership). 

 

Is it intentional to get Theodred to scale with multiplayer when he is controlled by the first player, because he can trigger that response for each player - including himself.   That would give 4 additional resources any time he was first player. 

 

All the ones I've looked through so far are amazing btw, really wish I had the means to get these printed so I could use them.

## 5 [John Constantine on December 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/?do=findComment&comment=2528997)

Prince is now a Warrior he should have been all along.

 

Theodred reads "after players", which means it triggers only after all players finished committing their characters. I made this because vanilla Theorded, if you play by the rules, can't give resources to heroes controlled by players that go after the controller of Theodred, because technically when Theodred commits to the quest - players after Theodred haven't had the chance to commit anybody to the quest yet. I developed a wording that would allow Theodred to give a resource to anybody, regardless of the player order.

 

Thank you, by the way :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ah!  Wishful thinking on my part when reading it!  lol.

Harbor Mastor in Lore says "yout" instead of "your".

 

I like the silvan changes, but I really like Gleowine.  Very flavorful and functional. 

 

Guarded Ceaslessly - I'd personally like to see it attach that Scout/Ranger as a guarded ally and after you explore that location you can get the ally back.  The original kept the character investment of exhausting each turn to continue to guard the location and I feel that is lost as is. 

 

Oh man I like Out of the Wild so much!

 

Looking at Thalin, I'd say he is still perhaps better worded as a passive instead of a response. Also, the requirement of questing comes pretty late in the sentence.  Since that is the initial requirement, I think it should get noted first. Maybe something like "While Thalin is committed to the quest, deal 1 damage to each enemy revealed before resolving any of that enemy's card effects."

 

Much prefer your version of Horn of Gondor than what we have now - and Steward for that matter.   I like all the "choose a player" cards you've changed that used to only effect the first player.

 

Dwalin (spirit) I'd change the wording to "If that enemy is destroyed before the end of that phase" instead of "until". 

 

I'm curious - what is your reasoning for rewording all the doom guys to have printed doom and a response that cancels it?

## 8 [John Constantine on December 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236256-lotr-lcg-rework-project-v10-release/?do=findComment&comment=2529706)

Thanks for the typo - fixed it and added it to the queue.

 

Gleowine - I aim to breathe life into Song fluff any way I can :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Guarded Ceaslessly - this is more of a matter of balance and viability than fluff. The unncessary fiddliness is the thing I tried to remove from this card. Exhausting characters every turn to rid a location of it's threat, and at the rate of -2 per character... There is just better location control available. I wanted to keep it relevant, while retaining the theme as much as I could, which I did by implementing the Scout/Ranger exhaustion cost.

 

As for Thalin, I took the wording out of Don't Be Hasty (an official card), and with that wording in my opinion a player would be able to tell by himself if Crows surge or not when Thalin kills them, without going to forums or sending a rule question to the developers.

 

Yeah, I don't get that whole first player dependency. Why? It's a co-op game, why those effects should be tied to a specific player that changes every turn? Choice gives a room of breath to planning and strategy.

 

Short answer? The Seeing-stone event. Long answer? Any future potential card that might reference a card with a Doomed keyword.

Awesome.  Thanks for the details and all the effort into this.  It would definitely bring a lot of cards out of the box/binder/coaster status if we had these.

For Son of Arnor, since abilities trigger sentence be sentence, I think the +engagement cost has to come before the engagement itself if you want stuff like Sam to trigger. It needs to be written more like Mablung ally. Actually, their abilities seem a little similar...

Good observation, I'll swap the effects so that it'll work as intended.

Small update, mainly fixing of errors and slight wording adjustments. Main spotlight is usability improvements of the optional doom cards.

This is some great work! Thanks for the effort you put into this!

Just one question (or two actually), did you make these with Strange Eons? And if so, would you mind sharing these files? I¨'d love to translate this stuff into german. And while doing so, maybe change one or two things to my liking ;-) Having the texts and pics ready for editing would make it a lot easier..

Oh, I'm sorry, I somehow missed this post. I'm not a specialist about printing, but if you mean a higher resolution images - I can provide you with them. Maybe I should add them to the original post...

Thanks! No, I made them using Photoshop and GeckoTH's templates. Sorry, but it feels kinda wrong sharing the source files of stuff I spent so much time on.

Sorry, no offense. Totally understand you.

Also, it shouldn't be a thing to recreate these cards for myself. I just have a hard time finding decent pics of the original artworks. If I may ask, how did you get them? Just searched the internet?

Yeah, google image search for ages. Also search on artists sites like DeviantArt. Also, tracking down artists by name printed on their cards. And then, if everything else fails, I just used the card scan, with a lot of photoshop polishing and re-cereating.

I see, thanks a ton! I understand very well now how you feel towards giving this away :-)

Now let's see if I find enough to do me a set of these cards in german...

Hey Constantine.

 

First, HUGE fan of these reworks. I've always wanted some of these cards to be worth their space and now they are!

One question: In the context of these cards, are you planning on changing the "Bow of the Galadhrim" card? Because as it stands right now, the reworked Rivendell Bow seems to be strictly better, other than not being able to attach to Silvan characters. Any thoughts on this?

Hey, Tracyn2! 

Thanks a bunch! Glad it striked your fancy.

So, after your question I've reviewed the cards, and while new Rivendell Bow seems to be stronger, I would say that it is more different than stronger. I would, however, probably throw in an additional trait for Galadhrim Bow - Scout.

So you mean that you could attach it to either a Scout or Silvan character, rather than only a Silvan character with printed Ranged keyword?

My concern was that Rivendell Bow always gives +2 Attack if you have the printed Ranged Keyword, but Bow of the Galadhrim required you have the printed Ranged keyword to get even +1 attack out of it. 

I am also working from the assumption you hadn't changed Galadhrim Bow yet, because I didn't see it in the album.

Sorry to be such a stickler, but I've been playing using your changes, and both groups of Elves are some of my favorite factions, so I notice when there appears to be such a difference.

Rivendell Bow giving +2 to printed ranged characters is both it's blessing and curse, because it strictly limits the number of characters it can ever give the +2 bonus to.

I didn't changed Galadhrim Bow, but now that you bring that up, I might changing it in a way of removing reqired ranged to attach and by adding a scout trait for possible attachment targets.

It's a company that prints custom cards [http://www.printerstudio.com/personalized/custom_playing_cards_blank_cards.html]. It takes some work to make the order, since you need to manually upload the image for each distinct card.
