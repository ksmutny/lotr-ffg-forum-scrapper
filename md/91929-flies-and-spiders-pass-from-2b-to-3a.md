# [Flies and Spiders - pass from 2b to 3a](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91929-flies-and-spiders-pass-from-2b-to-3a/)

The card 2b, Lost in the Dark [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-hobbit/on-the-doorstep/lost-in-the-dark-otd], say that first player has to create other new personal staging area. The question is, if you play alone: there is a spider in staging area, when you create the new staging area, this spider is discarded or it is waiting when you explore 3b?

I guess, if there is a spider engaged to you just before pass to 3a, this spider continues in front of you, isn't? This enemy is not discarded neither waiting for the 4a, true?

 

Ah! In multiplayer, each round the first player is the next by the right hand, isnt? The only diference is that Bilbo always stay with the player that plays in 3b, ok?

In solo, I´d say the spider is waiting for you at 4A.

From quest 3B: "Do not pass the first player token."

Ah! True, i guess then that the first player is always the same until he pass 3b, isn't?

Errated in 1.5 :

Discard 2B or stage 3?
