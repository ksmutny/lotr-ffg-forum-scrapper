Hi guys,

Do you know if objective allies can be used on different scenarios?, example: Wilyador on Escape from Dol Guldur scenario.

Thanks

No. Objective allies are technically part of the encounter deck, so they only appear in a quest if they're in one of the encounter sets used to build the encounter deck for that quest. In the case of Wilyador, he's part of the Journey to Rhosgobel encounter set so he appears nowhere else.

This does raise the possibility of a house-rules mini-Nightmare mode: just include Nalir in every quest! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
