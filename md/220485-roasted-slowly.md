# [Roasted Slowly?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220485-roasted-slowly/)

Is it just me or has anyone else miss read or read the card too quickly and read it as the following.

This is how I understood it, while reading it over too quickly. 
"Then, shuffle Roasted back slowly into the encounter deck."

 

Doing the shuffle slowly. Get it. 

Had to reread the card and then I was like aaah, cards name is Roasted Slowly.  

Guess it would have helped me to use quotation marks for the cards name in the text box.

 

Let me know if it's just me.

Slowly starts with a capital while not being the first word in the sentence, so I had no such problem.

One way or another, this card should be put back slowly into the encounter deck without anybody filping the table.

Okay, another question. How many of you guys actually lost a Hero to this card?

In an early episode of Cardboard of the Rings they mentioned how they both initially read it as saying you should shuffle it slowly back in, so it's definitely not just you.

 

I've never drawn this card while I had a sacked hero.

This is the adventure I'm currently playing so before long I think I'll have a toasty hero. ... I'll post up when I do :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You read, "... shuffle Roasted back slowly ..."

 

Whereas the card has "... shuffle Roasted Slowly back ..."

 

The lesson might be "Read carefully" or "Read slowly" or "What the hell, shuffle slowly."   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Legolas was Roasted Slowly in my Random Progression series.

I think part of the reason for the misread is the line break. If it was "shuffle Roasted Slowly back into the encounter deck" then it wouldn't be so easily misread, it's because it's:

 

"card 'Sacked!' attached. Then, shuffle Roasted

Slowly back into the encounter deck."

 

The line break makes it easier to disassociate the 'slowly' from the 'roasted'.
