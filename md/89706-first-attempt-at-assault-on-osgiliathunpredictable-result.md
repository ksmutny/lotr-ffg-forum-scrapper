After having checked all of the encounter cards I was pretty happy for this new scenario, because it promised to be a good challenge...well I just won it during turn 0 with a total threat of 24 and 3 damages.

 

Here it is how : I choose an Uruk Lieutenant and The King's Library and add them to the staging area...my heroes are Legolas, Hama and Glorfindel (FoS), I play an envoy of pelargir from my tactics heroes giving back one resource to Legolas, then light of valinor on Glorfindel and a blade of gondolin on Legolas...I quest for 4 (glorfindel+envoy) the encounter deck reveals an uruk soldier (total threat in the s.a. is 5), I raise my threat by 1 for questing unseccseffully (24), I travel to the king's library revealing a card from the e.d., it's a copy of southron mercenaries. I engege him (resolve archery on legolas) and defend his attack with glorfindel (ready because of light of valinor), no shadow, so 2 damages. Legolas and Hama kill the southron and legolas and blade of gondolin place 3 progress tokens on the library...so I have 1 osgiliath location and there aren't any other in play.........my first thought was...WOW...my second was.....MEEH...

this is a common thing with this quest- you can make it very easy for yourself, or very hard depending on choices. there is a thread somewhere of how you can win with boromir without a deck by choosing the location you can exhaust a hero to place 1 progress on

 

of course i think what this quest is designed to do is give variability in difficulty....like choosing on a computer game you can alter to your needs.

Im sorry but i solo mode this quest is too easy. Choosing different locations snd enemy in the begin make it a bit longer not more difficult in my opinion.

But in coop this quest is very difficult and cool
