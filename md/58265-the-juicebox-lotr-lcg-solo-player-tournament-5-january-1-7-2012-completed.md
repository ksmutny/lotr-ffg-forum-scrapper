# [The juicebox LOTR LCG Solo Player Tournament (#5) [January 1-7, 2012] [COMPLETED]](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/)

## 1 [juicebox on January 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573232)

Welcome & Introduction:

Welcome to my fifth Solo Player LOTR LCG Tournament. This week’s tournament takes the next step in a series of tournaments exploring the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.

Note: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].

Will you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!

After the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].

And now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!

First game, and already a rather good result which is close to my personal record of 70 points. Have to say that I don't like Rhosgobel as it feels like a lottery. SO here is my first result:

 

Heroes: Glóin, Beravor, Bilbo

Heroes Threat: 24

Heroes Damage: 0

Rounds: 60

Victory Points: 4

Result: 80

 

Encounters were:

1. Dol Guldur Beast Master (never engaged him)

2. Driven by Shadow

3. Black Forest Bats (engaged and killed in round 4)

4. Forest Grove (scenario action, travelled to next round) / Caught in a Net

5. Black Forest Bats (scenario action, killed the same round) / Mirkwood Flock / Great Forest Web (guarded Athelas, travelled to next round)

6. Mirkwood Flock

7. Forest Grove

 

Played Henamarth in round 1 and Radagast in round 2, possibly the most powerful 6 resource combo early in the game. Radagast could collect 5 resources until round 7 which he then spent to heal Wilyador. I drew 2 Lore of Imladris during the game which healed Wilyador for another 10 points. PoL in round 3 supported me with enough questing power, and a Silverlode Archer in round 4 defeated the 2 Black Forest Bats. It was perhaps a mistake to play the archer, as I could have used these resources to play Gandalf in my last round, but I wanted to avoid possible nasty shadow card effects by the bats (still had to assign 4 points damage to Wilyador thanks to Festering Wounds and Swarming Insects). Managed to Sneak Gandalf twice in the quest phase and used him to lower my threat my 10 points. Bilbo got caught in a net, fortunatly he wasn't exhausted at that point. Used him to grab the Athelas in round 6.

Ok, and now for real:

I built a deck that was not designed for defeating the deck as often as possible, but to specifically reach a superb score.

Heroes: Glorfindel, Éowyn, Frodo
Heroes Threat: 24
Heroes Damage: 2
Rounds: 20
Victory Points: 4
Result: 42

It wasn't especially hard to get this result, and those who have multiple cores will have it even more easy. The most difficult part, as always, is to get the right encounters. Here are mine:

1. Athelas, Black Forest Bat
2. Athelas, Mirkwood Flock
3. King Spider

I think the experts will know what happened, so I have fun to figure it out. My fear is that as it's not that difficult to get to this result (the only tricky thing is to grab an Athelas in time) this tournament will become rather dull. Didn't have Steward of Gondor btw, so two additional Sneak/Gandalf should be possible to get it down to 30 points (without the hero damage).

This is going to be a boring tourny lol.

Heroes: Denethor, Éowyn, Frodo
Heroes Threat: 25
Heroes Damage: 0
Rounds: 10
Victory Points: 4
Result: 31

Encounters:

Athelas Guarded: Evil Storm

Black Forest Bats

As lepotokurt stated, I will not say how this was done because it was too easy and all I needed was the right encounters and a couple of cards (even then there are many encounters that work).  I actually have a way to get a score around 10 I think but I think it needs to be too lucky to actually work, I tried it a few times and failed so I ended up posting this one as my best score but will try beating it. (With this group of heroes, it is impossible to do better though imo)

 

Edit: Forgot to put an encounter card

I guess you didn't travel to Rhosgobel? Cause in that case it might be that your result is invalid, but I am not sure myself, to be honest. I will ask the board experts in another thread. As long as Rhosgobel is in the staging area, you cannot heal Wilyador. And I think this also means healing Wilyador with Athelas in stage 3B:

 

Oh, and don't forget that Athelas is guarded, so there should have been dealt a guarding encounter card.

i would say you CANNOT heal if rhosgobel is in the staging area no matter what round

 I know I can lower this, but here's a score to start out with: damage 1; threat 35; vvictory points 4 (Rhosgobel); 6 rounds; score---92.  Heroes glorfindel, eowyn, theodred.

@ Engineer: Just realized that Evil Storm is not part of this encounter set. Only Orcs and Spiders are used from the corset. Either you took the wrong set of encounter cards, or this one somehow found its way between the Orc cards. Happened to me once, and it took me about 20 games to realize that the whole time I had a wrong encounter card in my deck.

First try today. Gandalf never showed up this time.

Heroes: Éowyn, Bilbo, Beravor
Heroes Threat: 31
Heroes Damage: 0
Rounds: 30
Victory Points: 4
Result: 57

Encounters:

1. Mirkwood Flock (never engaged)

2. Dol Guldur Beastmaster (never engaged)

Well I did that score 2 times, so it will only be a matter of time before I get the same score because it's really easy.  I put in the wrong one in... and I traveled to Rhosgobel yes and got the 4 points for it, don't see where the problem is for that part though if you want to point out where I made that mistake?

 

Edit: LMAO I checked my deck and low and behold I didn't make a mistake in my encounter deck, I actually only had that one card that was in my encounter deck and I didn't write down what cards I got the other time I scored, hurray I need to waste another hour or two to get the same score cuz of one card mis-insert.

I'm playing a new deck which will be able to do better than the last one anyway.

## 11 [Da_Engineer on January 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573469)

I was able to get a THEORETICAL score of 17 with another deck but it's pretty much impossible so I won't even attempt it.  I am just posting it since I assume some people might be interested even though it's so improbable that it's not even worth trying (You need exactly 6 cards within the first 8 ALONG with 2 perfect encounters which there are quite a few of but not enough to make this scenario probable)

Heroes: Eowyn, Gloin, Theodred
Heroes Threat: 11
Heroes Damage: 0
Rounds: 10
Victory Points: 4
Result: 17  (Result is THEORETICAL, do not use)

Encounters:

Yeah, I think now got it! Wow! Took me some time to figure it out, but won't spoil it here.  So you only needed three cards, and of course the right encounters and one Athelas. Forgot about that one dirty little card, though I have it in my deck myself.

Btw, I chose Glorfindel over Denethor, because it's possible to get a similar result like mine even without PoL. That way I can play Lore of Imladris additional to Athelas.

 

Edit:

Although, now that I see your new post you apparently played a somewhat different hand. Just one question, do you really play all the games or only those with a good starting hand? Or do you play amazingly fast, lol?

 

## 14 [Da_Engineer on January 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573488)

Depends on the game, with the other scenario I was playing 1 round and if I knew I wouldn't beat my previous score I would start over.

For this quest and my deck it takes about 4-5 minutes per game. (This includes shuffling)

Glorfindel is -4 points because of threat though.

PS: You are right with the 3 cards for the first play but you shouldn't even have given that clue, will be more fun for others to try to figure it out themselves imo.  I guess it also depends on the person.  There's multiple ways (combos of cards) to obtain the same result that I got btw, I include them all in my deck and it increases the chances of getting one of the combos on card draw.

 Better: damage to Heros, 7; threat 32; victory points 4; rds 3, (30); total: 65.  Heros, eowyn, glorfindel, denethor.

## 16 [Zjb12 on January 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58265-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-5-january-1-7-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=573510)

 Even better: threat, 26; rds 3 (30); victory points 4; final score: 52.  Heros, eowyn, glorfindel, denethor.

Then do enlighten us.

If you just need 3 cards and one of them needs to be Lore of Imladris as you didn´t draw an Athelas.

You  were obvisouly blocking the Flock with Wilyador so he had 5 damage in round 2.

But just to overcome the 10 threat in turn one you need additionally  quest power... so you must play another card.

And then you must heal the eagle. So you now have one other card to play. And this one must be worth 7 willpower.

So I am really interested.

How did you lower your threat by 4?

And again...how did you quest in round two? I mean how did you manage the 17 willpower?

I don't think that engagingthe Flock would be a good idea, as you sacrifice Wilyador's 1 WP for reducing the threat by only 1 point. Gains you nothing.

I thought I had it figured out, but then I realized that Ancient Mathom's effect doesn't work in time to use those additional cards to raise your WP via PoL. Now I'm also curious.

Also to play PoL and Lore of Imladris he would have needed 3 lore resources. So this would lead to a Song of wisdom needed and leaves only 2 resources to play something other.

Tried a new tactic and it took me only three games until it finally worked. It only needs 3 different cards to have a relatively easy win, at least if one uses Glorfindel. Beravor and even Denethor might also work, but in that case it depends a lot to the encounters that you draw. In this scenario I played four cards, as I had some spare resources.

Swarming insects only deals one damage to each character without an attachment.I guess you meant to add this to round 2 "Festering Wounds"?

 New low score for me: threat 31; damage 4; victory points 4; round counter 1 (10pts)====41!!!

 Wow, seems my previous deck is quite useless in this one........altough it was tweaked a bit.

 

 

Frodo, Beravor, Theodred

 

Threat: 3

 

Wounds: 2

 

Rounds: 5

 

Victory points: 4

 

Total: 51

 

 

Encounter cards were:

 

2. Swarming Insects ( 2 damage to Beravor and Theodred and Wilyador)

2. Feastering Wounds

3. Mirkwood Flock ( shadow card let´s damage go to Wylador)

4. Mountains of Mirkwood ( traveled there and got The Necormancer´s Reach ( was canceled) )

5. Caught in a Web 

 

Wilyadors damage progress: 

 

End of turn 

1: 5

2: 9

3: 13

4: 15

 

Wyliador was healed with 3 Lore of Imaldris just before it was too late. ( an Athelas would have been nice )

 

 

As I just saw this will be a quite useless score .........as there are already scores in the 30s......ah just noticed there´s a already a 29. Wow.

 

 

 

 

 

Swarming insects only deals one damage to each character without an attachment.I guess you meant to add this to round 2 "Festering Wounds"?



Sorry, that was a mistake in writing. It was one wound on Beravor and one on Theodred and of course one on Wilyador. Frodo hat a song attached.

So for the final score my heroes had a total of 2 wounds.

Tried a new tactic and it took me only three games until it finally worked. It only needs 3 different cards to have a relatively easy win, at least if one uses Glorfindel. Beravor and even Denethor might also work, but in that case it depends a lot to the encounters that you draw. In this scenario I played four cards, as I had some spare resources.

 

Heroes: Glorfindel, Éowyn, Frodo

2. Black Forest Bats



 

PoL, Escort and Lore of Imladris? But who was your blocke........ah never mind........You assigned the damage that came from the attack to Glorfindel and healed one wound.

Also to play PoL and Lore of Imladris he would have needed 3 lore resources. So this would lead to a Song of wisdom needed and leaves only 2 resources to play something other.



Yup, which means I didn't play one of them.

Close. You're right about Glorfindel and Lore of Imladris (surprise, surprise). I also used one of the two other cards that you mentioned. And two others (of which one wasn't even necessary for the win, but could have made a difference if there had been a different encounter in round 2).

Well if you used Glorfindel to heal you also needed the song of wisdom. So this leaves 2 resources. So it wash´t the Escort as there would´t have been enough resources for 2 other cards. So it must have been the PoL. But that leaves only one resource to play two cards. And although I now one 0 cost card which would be good, it makes no sense at that point.

Hm interesting. For turn one you had to discard one card to eowyn to get the 11 willpower needed. Then you play one Song, Lore of Imladris, heal one wound and play PoL..........this leaves you with one resource to spent and 4 cards to discard for PoL. So how did you get the 17 willpower?

So you need 10 Willpower for stage 1.

You start with 8 Willpower if you let Wilyador quest. So you need at least one more willpower if you discard one card to eowyn. If you play an ally you would be at 10. That leaves only 2 resources to play something like the Escort. But then again only 14 willpower and 17 needed. There is obviously no SneakGanalf involved, I seems I am to ignorant to see how you played it and I cannot think of any cards which would have made it possible. Especially if there are no Songs involved.

This build is a little better.  The best score possible with it is 24 actually which isn't that improbable but haven't got it yet.

Heroes: Gloin, Éowyn, Denethor
Heroes Threat: 23
Heroes Damage: 0
Rounds: 10
Victory Points: 4
Result: 29

Encounters:

Hummerhorns

 



If you played a sneak Gandalf your score should be 28.

So the best score possible with 2 sneak Gandalfs, 1 Escort from Edoras and 1 Lore of Imladris is 23.

After getting the necessary cards 5 times and being destroyed by the wrong encounters, I finally got both the cards and the encounters right. This time with another variant of cards:

 

Heroes: Glorfindel, Éowyn, Frodo

Heroes Damage: 0

Rounds: 10

Victory Points: 4

Result: 35

 

Encounters:

1. Mistwood Flock (not engaged)

2. Great Forest Web

 

The best I can get with this deck is 30, if I could get the Sneak/Gandalf combo. In one of my game I had exactly this combo, but I did draw Festering Wounds in my first turn.

Hm so to get to 30 it will be like ...... 2 resources to heal, 2 for the sneak attack, leaves 2 blue ones for lets say an escort. Makes 19 Willpower in turn 2 and you lower your threat with the Gandalf.

 

So did you play 2 Escorts to get to the 35 result??

Here's my attempt:

 

Heroes: Eowyn, Bilbo, Theodred (probably my favorite solo trio)

Score: 49

Rounds 4 (30)

Threat 23 (was able to use Galadrims Greetings once)

Victory Points 4 (Rhosgobel obviously)

0 damage.

 

I healed Wyliador with one Athelas and one Lore of Imladris. Feels kind of luck dependant to find these cards, but the effect on stage 2B helped for the Athelas and three Ancient Mathoms on Rhosgobel did their job for Lore of Imladris.

 

Encounter cards have been:

Turn 1: Exhaustion (cancelled)

Turn 2: Exhaustion (cancelled)

Turn 3: Mirkwood Flock

Turn 4: Athelas guarded by the other "flying" enemy (via quest effect) + Eyes of the Forest.

Victory: 4

Wounds: 3

Rounds: 2(10)

Heroes: Glorfindel, Éowyn, Gloin

I snuck in Gandalf to draw 3 and lucked into the healing lore I needed to win the quest turn 2 rather than loosing it... (I've been playing to get a good score not to consistently win as it looks like most people have been for these). Playing high risk I've lost 6 or 7 games in a row before pulling what I needed to get this win on this one.

Round 1: Got Gandalf, Sneak Attack and Lore of Imladris in hand which was good enough to give it a go. Bilbo drew me a Steward of Gondor and an Escort to Edoras. Quest all heroes and Wliyador with a Sneak Attacked Gandalf for -5 threat. Theodred gives Eowyn a resource. Encounter deck throws me a Mirkwood Flock. That’s 12 questing vs. 3 threat for 9 progress tokens… on to 2a/2b. Travel to Rhosgobel. Wilyador up to 4 damage and threat rises to 22

Round 2: Bilbo draws me another Sneak Attack (YES!) and another Lore of Imladris. Eowyn summons an Escort to Edoras leaving her with 1 Resource. Bilbo uses Lore of Imladris to heal Wilyador. Everyone quests again with a Sneak Attacked Gandalf for -5 threat. Theodred gives himself a resource. Encounter deck gives me an Athelas guarded by a Swarming Insects treachery. Eowyn uses a Test of Will to cancel the When Revealed effect. That leaves me with 16 questing vs. 1 threat for 15 progress tokens. 4 on Rhosgobel and 11 on the quest. Eowyn ditches a Snow Born Scout from hand in increase Willpower by 1 for the last progress token moving to 3a/3b. Wilyador has no damage… VICTORY!

I built this deck with this scenario in mind but it required a lot of plays to get lucky. You need to get 5 cards in the early game to make it happen (Gandalf, Sneak Attack x2, Lore of Imladris and Escort to Edoras) then get lucky in the Encounter Deck. Bilbo is really useful for this as he gives you 10 cards to try and get luck by the top of turn 2.

I don't want to spoil your fun, but which hero of yours claimed the Athelas? Sounds to me like every hero has been exhausted on turn 2.

Wily had 4 dmg on it and wraith says he used Lore of Imladris, no need for Athelas.

Ahh, my bad. I apologize. I had no ill intent.

Didn't need the Altheas.  Use Lore of Ilmadris instead.

 Was a long time coming, but finally was able to lower my score today.  Switched out glorfindel for Bilbao after reading wraith's comments, but kept my deck the same otherwise.  Couple hours later, 28!!!  

Heros: eowyn, bilbo, theodred.

Final threat: 22.

1 Round points: 10

Victory points: -4

Encounters were: caught in a web which I could pay off since I hadn't used eowyn's resource and theodred had used his kickback to give her pool another.  Then second round was an athelas guarded by black forest bats.  However, I healed with a lore of imladris.  Snuck gandalf 2x.  1 time for 3 more cards, 1 time to reduce threat by 5.

 Wow, my hat is off to all the players who placed a score in this week's tourney.  FYI, I attempted this quest a lot and never managed to get a good enough score.  

The amount of luck and repetitions that I was relying on (and from reading the posts in this thread, others were relying on as well) have lead me to put a post on Juicebox's ideas thread.  I encourage you all to read it and reply to it.

Congrats again to the better players.  I don't like admitting I got owned, but....I got owned this week :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 For the records I forgot to mention that my third encounter card was Necromancer's Pass.

Congrats to all thos who cracked the 30!!!!!!!!!

 

Here is how I ran my first attempt. Even if it wasn't as good as my second one, I love it , because it's so elegant:

 

Turn 1:

1) play "Escort from Edoras"

2) send everyone but Escort questing

2) play "Strength of Will" after travelling to Rhosgobel; exhaust "Escort from Edoras"; place two progress tokens on Rhosgobel

 

Turn 2:

1) play "Song of Wisdom" on Éowyn

2) use Glorfindel's action to heal one wound on himself

3) send everyone questing

4) play "Lore of Imladris" to heal Willy
