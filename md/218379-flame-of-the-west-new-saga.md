O MY SWEET GANDALF! TACTICS EOWYN!

 

Do you know how long I have been dreaming of this day?

+9 attack and readying? I suppose 10 Attack is what you need to kill the Witch-King in one blow.

> +9 attack and readying? I suppose 10 Attack is what you need to kill the Witch-King in one blow.

Probably it has to be dealt by one hero. Like only one hero can attack the witch king each round, and he has 4 shields and 6 life or something like that.

woahhhhh overload of excitement!!!

Eowyn is badass but look at the new version of Arargorn!!!!

Attach Sword that was broken and he quests for three without exhausting and then has sentinel as well!!

Epic art on some of the encounter cards too!!

This is the moment I have waited for longer than any other. The Battle of the Pelennor absolutely needs to be the most epic quest to date.

And that Tactics Eowyn. Amazing.

Paired with theoden,eowyn will be a 5 WP tactics hero. That'll be nice and I wonder if it'll open up solo tactics decks a bit.

How about that art on Eowyn? Looks sweet to me: still Magali-pretty but bad-ass.

The wording on her means that Loragorn's threat reset (not in one of the Flame of the West scenarios, obviously) would count her as 9, not 6, right?

Heh, you need 16 attack to kill the burden enemy in the back. So Eowyn needs Herugrim + 2 extra attack from somewhere.

Tactics Eowyn looks Amazing: she quests a ton, kills bosses, and her starting threat is basically 6, which is great... can't wait to see the decks created around her!

 

EDIT: It's also amazing how well she combines with Tactics Merry, which is fortunate for thematic decks

Eowyn is completely ridiculous.  She'd be great at 9 threat, but she's basically 6?  Absurd.

Tactics Eowyn is badass! My prayers for more mono, solo Tactics support has been answered! I'm so glad to see the designers not afraid to give tactics some new toys in terms of questing, a powerful one too. 4 Willpower hero in Tactics!? Thought I never see the day. :3

At six threat all you get is her raw stats (4 will is great but 1/1/3 sucks) and if you want to use her ability it sort of bumps her threat cost to 9.

I actually really like this design because it helps with secrecy and lower starting threat in general but on the flipside you need to raise threat when you use it which might be in the last few turns when you might not be able to take a threat increase of 3.

It might also put you at an unsafe threat level where nasty effects or enemies you were previously avoiding now directly effect or engage you.

yes she has an insane starting threat cost but in the vast majority of games I see her costing 9 threat eventually and because its 6 to start with then 3 later on it not only gives you more breathing room at the start but also forces you to be more strategic as to when you will use her ability abd whether you can afford its cost.

Add in Tactics Merry and you start with a respectable 24 starting Threat and questing for 11 Willpower out of the gate. That's unheard of in tactics!

I do love that combo for thematic reasons, but to fully take advantage of your Rohan synergy I would want to run a Rohan Spirit hero in slot 3...which is a problem unless you for some reason want to run Dunhere. 

 

Of course, in multiplayer with another player rocking some Spirit this isn't as much of a problem.

I was looking at the encounter to see what kind of mechanics the quest might have, it looks like necromancer's reach is back with a vengeance. Admittedly it does have an alternate target but I'm guessing that's the objective with it being Mina's tirith.

Very exciting, with excellent art for a powerful tactics version of Eowyn. I also like the name of her Tactics event, "Sterner than Steel."
 
A few observations, with speculation:
This is our first fellowship hero without an ability that requires fellowship resources. I wonder if the quests will be a bit more like the Hobbit quests, where encounter cards required Baggins resources. The boon version of Gildor Inglorion, Shifting Quagmire and We Hates Them! (both from The Land of Shadow), and the newly spoiled Overcome by Fear are the only encounter cards so far to use fellowship resources. Of course, Aragorn's resources won't be wasted if he has Celebrian's Stone or Sword that was Broken attached.
 
Overcome by Fear is a burden, though I imagine it will be possible to avoid it (probably it will only be earned if it's attached at the end of the quest). The flying Nazgul is our first burden enemy, and will almost certainly have surge (0 threat, high engagement). I wonder whether it will be possible to avoid earning that burden. I also wonder whether, if earned, that burden will be included for the Ringbearer quests in the sixth box, or only in the Battle of the Morannon quest.
 
How important will hit points be in The Passing of the Grey Company? Into Fangorn had several cards that damaged characters, and the nightmare version had a location that removed the Hinder keyword from enemies. I wonder if we'll see anything like that here.
 
Since speed is important in The Siege of Gondor, I hope we get a powerful Oathbreakers objective ally.
 
I wonder whether the Witch-king will interact with the Sorcery trait. "Forced: When the Witch-king is dealt a shadow card with the Sorcery trait, resolve that card's When Revealed effect" would be brutal.
 

> Still, we don't get to defend the walls of Minas Tirith?

 

There are so many great moments in the story. I like how campaign mode follows the Ringbearer and Aragorn, while sneaking in elements of other stories (like Rouse the Ents, stage 1 of The Road to Isengard). I imagine that the beginning of The Battle of Pelennor Fields will involve Grond and defending Minas Tirith, especially since Spells of Ruin mentions damage on Minas Tirith. I like Aragorn's delayed entry into the battle (using our first double-sided card that's part of two different encounter sets!), and I imagine his arrival will be significant: perhaps he needs to be in play to advance to the next stage, or perhaps spending Fellowship resources helps to make things less difficult.

 

> the expansion's new heroes and player cards represent the strength of the alliance between the Men of Gondor, the Riders of Rohan, and the Elves and Dúnedain of the Grey Company. Nearly all the new player cards bear either the Gondor, Rohan, or Dúnedain traits...
>  
> ...you'll find new boons that allow you to swear your fealty to either Gondor or Rohan
> 
>  

 

The focus on Rohan and Gondor means that the second hero is probably Gondor. Leadership Denethor and Spirit Imrahil are reasonable possibilities (though Denethor feels strange, especially since there isn't a siege of Gondor quest that focuses on Minas Tirith). Other options include Beregond (perhaps Leadership), Hurin the Tall or Forlong (both of whom rode out with Imrahil and Hirluin to help Eomer), or perhaps even Duinhir, lord of Morthond. Ally Halbarad seems very likely, and ally Merry and Pippin are almost certainly excluded (perhaps delayed to the last box). Eomer is important, so unless we get hero Eomer in the last box or two Rohan heroes in this box, ally Eomer seems likely.
 
I was hoping for the banner that Arwen made for Aragorn (with the emblems of Elendil) as a boon, but that seems unlikely now (though perhaps it could be the boon that allows you to swear fealty to Gondor). Maybe we'll get it as a player card instead.
 
Finally, the announcement article for The Land of Shadow was April 30, 2015, and it was at Gen Con last year. While there's no guarantee, a tentative Q3 release date (July to September) means there's a good chance The Flame of the West will be at Gen Con this year.

Agreed. So very glad FFG broke with precedent and gave us an Eowyn worthy of her finest moment in the novels. The first female tactics hero in the game and one that looks very fun to play.

Oh, and how about that box cover art, too!

 

On a slightly different note, thinking ahead to the Fellowship Event this year, I bet we see a play-mat with Return of the King art on it. The previous Events had play-mats from Fellowship and then Two Towers. Seems like ROTK fits the pattern. But as I mentioned above, FFG just showed us they will break precedent, so who knows.

I'm hoping for Leadership Denethor personally. Though Flight of the Stormcaller has a Leadership hero which I imagine could be Gondor. So I'm really not sure.

I do think that the second hero in the box will be Gondor, but maybe it could be Spirit? I don't think that we'll get a third Lore hero in a row.

I also think that it'll be a fairly big main character. So Denethor seems most likely to me, or maybe Imrahil. I can't think of any others off the top of my head who are central characters.

## 35 [Fingolfin Fate on April 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2188382)

So, the second hero must be Éomer, right? He's not in the core set or in any previous saga. And almost certainly Leadership as he will become king by the end of the third quest. The three Rohan heroes from this box and Treason will probably make good decks...

 

But again, what of the allies? I am hoping one for each sphere: Imrahil is given, right? Beregond, too. Denethor should as well unless he is an objective (or even enemy, hope not). Then, I was hoping for Merry and Pippin… hmm. They mention Gondor and Rohan traits, so either there will be no Hobbits or they will have gained the traits of their allegiance.

I personally hope Éomer is a Tactics or Leadership ally. If he was a hero that'd be 2 Rohan heroes in the mostly Gondor box. I bet the other hero will be Gondor, hopefully Leadership. For allies, all that Fingolfin said. Thinking of Leadership Pippin and Tactics Merry.

 

Man, I just can't stop thinking how awesome Tactics Eowyn is (can't believe I'm really saying that), and even though I was expecting a Magali art, it is still so badass. I like it a lot.

*snipped for emphasis*

 

That's odd, Eowyn is in the core set and now we have a new one for this saga. I do remember they wanted to avoid repeat heroes. I guess that rule doesn't apply anymore (which I'm glad, Eowyn tactics is amazing!). Rules are meant to be broken I guess haha

Right now I'm at work, so no, unfortunately I don't have them.

 

If I remember correctly, the closest I've ever got among the Tactics Eowyns I did was the one with 4/1/1/3 and text:

Response: After Eowyn quests successfuly, she gets +2 Attack until the end of the round.

Since it seems it will be a Gondor hero, I would bet it would be Imrahil or Beregond (most probably Imrahil). I do not bet on Denethor as he was not "at charge" during the siege, but maybe he will be an objective card for a quest card or something

## 41 [Fingolfin Fate on April 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2188501)

Wow, you guys are persuading me from Éomer. I thought he was the safest bet (beside Fellowship Aragorn) for the box, much safer than Éowyn. I do like the look of her new version way better than the Spirit one, so I am perfectly happy for the hero, though I still think they could achieve similar effect with a Dernhlem attachment (except the set-up threat discount).

 

Back to the other hero topic. Éomer surely plays a larger role within these chapters than any other candidate, except for Denethor (I am not considering characters who we got in previous saga: Théoden, Faramir, Merry, Pippin). Now, if they have made Éowyn, perhaps they will go for Denethor as well. And then, we might get Éomer in the last box?

 

Saving Éomer for the last box and having Denethor as the other hero would make Imrahil, Beregond, Merry, Pippin easy choices for allies. However, as much I would like to see them in ally versions, I have my doubts about the Hobbits, more so since the article doesn't mention their traits.

Denethor managed to keep things together during the seige until right at the end. Directing troops to defend Osgiliath so that Minis Tirith would not be besieged directly, and sending out riders to gather help from Rohan were good tactical moves.

Perhaps a hero version of him in this box could have an ability tied to threat increase. Showing that his actions, however valiant, were ultimately doomed.

It's fun to speculate at least.

Pretty blown away by Eowyn. The new Aragorn is no slouch either!

I believe that Eowyn -in solo- will pair well with Eomer. A tactis hero to quest, a tactics hero to attack and the other one can be either Tactics or Spirit Theodred, depending on what player woud like to have. Or else have Beregond as a third hero and each hero can make a job in his field

I totally agree that 4 willpower for 6 threat is bonkers... in any sphere honestly.

However that being said I would choose a hero with a nice repeatable powerful effect and average stats over a hero with great base stats and no ability every single time.

Also I think tactics of all spheres definitely deserves a 4 will, 6 threat cost hero more than any other. Mono tactics is far more doable now and she boosts Rohan massively as well.

couldn't agree more re the playmat, god I hope it uses the art from the cover...

I am the only one which is intrigued by the wording in Eowyn? Why her ability is "Once per game for the group", and not just "Once per game"?

 

EDIT: Ok, I just googled, and discovered that the "Once per game" is a limit for each player... I just didn't know that rule.

> I am the only one which is intrigued by the wording in Eowyn? Why her ability is "Once per game for the group", and not just "Once per game"?

 

The wording "Once per game for the group" prevents from giving Eowyn to another player. So her ability can only be used by one player in the entire game.

 

For instance, the "Once per game" effect of Lore Aragorn can be used by each player of the game if using Desperate alliance.

 

Desperate-Alliance.png [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Hobbit-On-the-Doorstep/Desperate-Alliance.png]

 

I think it's the first time we have this wording "Once per game for the group".

It's weird that Eowyn has not gained the Warrior trait.

I just thought that all "once per game" were referred to players as a group, that's why I found no sense in Eowyn's wording. All clear now.

I do not think there will be another Gandalf hero ... In order for the new one to have an ability to use him instead of the one already exists it should be something like "exhaust Gandalf and win the game" or something

I do believe as written above we will have Elrohir and Elladan allies though

I´m 90% on Imrahil (spirit?) in this box, as it will not be a second Rohan hero with Eowyn, and Imrahil plays a very big part in the story during the 5th book.

Allies: Elladan, Elrohir, Beregond, Bergil maybe? And Merry/Pippin allies in the last one?

Situational or not Beyond All Hope represents Gandalf the White. We already have two ally versions and a hero version all of which see LOTS of play and are all powerful. Not only do I think a fourth version is completely unnecessary but it would only further mess with multiplayer (which version does the entire group want to agree on for example) and would make it harder deciding which version you will use.

Also the hero is stupidly powerful, has more toys than any other hero and is neutral so can slot into so many lineups and decks.

furthermore Gandalf the Grey and Gandalf the White are the same person.. yes he dies and comes back but it is the same individual in the end so why can't the hero we already have represent both versions?

Don't get me wrong I totally see where you are coming from and yes he is an integral character but we have 3 versions of Gandalf already as well as the boon Beyond all Hope. I feel like the vast majority of characters deserve a second or even third version way before Gandalf does.

Sorry to be harsh but I really don't think we need or will see a version of Gandalf that is specifically Gandalf the White. I'm pretty sure we would already have him (in Treason of Saruman) if FFG were going to make him.

I love that there are so many others that want new versions of the twins... really really hope we get them....

Wow...Tactics Eowyn is bonkers...

 

I'm glad that they gave Tactics access to some willpower as I do believe they were the weakest of all the spheres, primarily due to not having enough willpower, but...6 threat for 4 willpower is crazy.  You can just choose to never use her ability if you desired.  At worst she is 9 threat for 4 willpower in Tactics which is something a great many players would gladly opt for.

If you are right and  the only way to play the might Gandalf the White (Gandalf the Gray is not the same, at least not for me) in this game is IF i use him in campaign and IF he dies and IF i get the boon ill be disapointed . I know we got lots of his version but Aragorn already has a lot too and we keep seeing him coming. This game is about decisions and cooperation, if there was another version the players should decide if its worth or not to play him. Agree that we should get priorities versions in another characters like the brothers but this guy is a big deal in history and so far he is playable only by a boon.

And just like that, mono-tactics became a thing. Even with no ability Eowyn would have seen a lot of play... but her ability (though limited) can be suitably epic. They did a great job thematically with this card, but I can see it being used in almost any deck that includes more than one tactics hero.

While I'm not urging to get a Gandalf the White hero for all the reasons Psychorocka mentioned, I'm not sure if I agree with this argument. By that logic, Tactics Eowyn, aka Dernhelm, shouldn't be a hero either, since she only became a badass warrior in the novels as well (not to mention that, if the game is so strictly set in that 17 year period we shouldn't have adult versions of her.)

She makes a great splash hero too, you don't need 2 Tactics heroes.  Merry was previously the best Tactics hero for keeping threat down and getting access to weapons for Haldir, Gondorian shield, etc.  Now Merry has some real competition.

I wouldn't mind seeing a new Gandalf hero outside the saga, a leadership or spirit version depicted in white with some sort of one-time awesome death/resurrection effect.  Within the saga I think Gandalf + Beyond All Hope perfectly represents Gandalf the White thematically.

That's exactly what I'm saying. Just because the rest of the game takes place before the main action of books doesn't mean we can't get cards depicting stuff that only happened in the books. I'd love to have an Andúril attachment, for instance.

That is true - I've used Merry(T) in so many decks to gain access to powerful tactics cards without including a 10+ threat hero... and I would argue that Eowyn(T) will be better than Merry(T) in essentially every such deck. You get 1 extra life and 2 extra willpower (these decks aren't usually built around Merry's ability, and he ends up questing most of the time) and the ability to kill almost anything once per game - all for the same starting threat!

 

Honestly the only downside I can even think of is that Eowyn(S) is still quite a good hero - but she had been getting competition already from Arwen and Galadriel.

Gandalf died and was reborn via magic as something different to what he was.

 

That's not really the same as Eowyn crossdressing and picking up a sword.

For the purposes of a card game that must make some thematic concessions, I think it kind of is, actually. I wouldn't mind using Gandalf the White in The Hobbit quests, just as I wouldn't mind using Frodo. And thematically I'd rather believe Gandalf died somewhere before that book and reborn than Frodo being born decades earlier. The game is full of crazy stuff like that, it comes with the territory.

 

I would not like to see a Gandalf the White hero because I think it's really unnecesary.

I'm pretty sure we won't see Elladan and Elrohir allies in this box since they don't have the Dúnedain trait. They might show up in the sixth box: unlike Halbarad, they were present at the battle of the Morannon. There's a good chance, however, that we'll get a Grey Company related card that works with Elladan and Elrohir (perhaps attach to a Dúnedain or Noldor ranger).

 

I said earlier that we probably wouldn't get Merry and Pippin allies in this box, but I was forgetting that they could have the Rohan and Gondor traits. There's also a chance that we get Merry in this box and Pippin (who fought at the Black Gate) in the last box.

 

Assuming they even out the number of heroes in each sphere in the last two saga boxes, we'll get a Leadership or Spirit hero to go with Éowyn (likely Gondor, so that the box doesn't have a heavy Rohan focus). Denethor, Beregond, and Imrahil are the most likely candidates. Of them, Imrahil plays the largest role in the battle of Pelennor Fields, so my guess is that we'll get a Spirit Imrahil hero. If that's the case, then we'll probably get a Spirit Gondor ally and a Tactics Rohan ally (just like Treabeard got Quickbeam to accompany him, Theoden got Háma, and Faramir and Damrod got Anborn and Mablung). Here's one possible configuration:

 

Fellowship Aragorn

Tactics Éowyn

Spirit Imrahil

 

Leadership Éomer

Tactics Merry

Spirit Beregond

Lore Halbarad

 

There are lots of ways to tweak this (perhaps delay Merry to the last box, making Éomer Tactics and Halbarad Leadership, then add a Lore Denethor or Ioreth ally), and there's also a decent chance that we'll get a Leadership Gondor hero instead of Spirit Imrahil, since Leadership is Gondor's primary sphere (likely with an Imrahil ally). Any other configurations seem likely?

This is probably just the article being unclear, but I hope we're getting a fellowship card. It might be related to the Grey Company, or it could be Arwen's banner for Aragorn.

I'm not sure it's fair to say that Eowyn "became a badass warrior" only after adopting the identity of Dernhelm.  She was trained for war, and war was her desire.  When she asked Aragorn permission to go with his company she made that clear:

---

"Too often have I heard of duty," she cried.  But am I not of the House of Eorl, a shieldmaiden and not a dry-nurse?  I have waited on faltering feet long enough.  Since they falter no longer, it seems, may I not now spend my life as I will?"

....

"But I am of the House of Eorl and not a serving-woman.  I can ride and wield blade, and I do not fear either pain or death."

---

When seeing Aragorn and his company off she was "clad as a Rider and girt with a sword", so Dernhelm was hardly the first time she'd picked up a sword.

 

In the battle, prior to dispatching the witch-king she rode unharmed in the furious charges into the enemy performed by Theoden, and slew the fell beast with a single blow.  "Maiden of the Rohirrim, child of kings, slender but as a steel-blade, fair but terrible.  A swift stroke she dealt, skilled and deadly."

 

If anything, the game is highly unrealistic in only giving her one attack in the first place -- though this makes her more effective for her threat cost, of course.

 

Eowyn was born in 2995, so she was about 24 at the death of Theoden.

Dernhelm is the biggest game changing card we've had in a long time.  Possibly ever.

 

I won't complain that she is overpowered, because it was going to take a card like that to make solo tactics viable.  I reserve the right to get sick of seeing her though.  For a while it will be like the early days of the game when Eowyn was in 75% of the decks.  Still, for a time, it will be welcome.

The only possible way to use Gandalf the White in our loved game is with Beyond all hope in a situacional quest, seeing the players opinions it seens to me that is beyond all hope that we get a REAL and true Gandalf the white card. I wouldnt like it to be a hero, but an ally with limited use would be fine. Dont know, you guys may be right, but I expected more from one of the most awesome and important characters in the history of the LOTR than just a boon campaing card.

It would need to share a title with Gandalf so you could not have multiple in play, nor include 6 copies of Gandalf in your deck (if they had different card titles you'd be able to do this).  The art and ability could set it apart.  I'd like to see it.  But as an ally and not a hero.  Gandalf hero is very rare in multiplayer as is, at least in my experience, since his presence has a noticeable limiting effect on other decks.

True that. She was already a warrior before her first appearance. But being more objective, in the story we actually see in the books she only technically fights in the battle, that's why I said that.

 

In any case, I so agree that Eowyn is a game changing card. The variety of decks that will be opened up once she releases is incredible.

Gandalf is one of the most awesome and important characters in the history of the LOTR.  The Gandalf heroes and allies alike say "Gandalf", not "Gandalf the Grey".  Gandalf is in the game, and well-used as well.  No other character is in so high a percentage of decks.

 

What I'd like to see is regular versions of the boon/treasure cards in the game.  I'd like to see Sting, Glamdring, Orcrist, Anduril and so forth in the game.  And the mithril shirt, though at a higher cost and larger effect.  It's horribly unthematic to have it be the equivalent of ring mail.

Gandalf The White:

4attack

4defense

You'd want it to be when he "enters play" so that you can't get around it by using Sneak Attack and other effects.  With the current healing cards available he is way too strong especially without some limitations on how many times it can trigger.

 

I do like his forced ability to remove all other Gandalf's from the game.    Without naming him Gandalf, his current attachments won't work on him though - so I'd suggest naming him Gandalf and just giving him "The White" trait or something.  It doesn't look as good but it would create less problems with the other Gandalf's and the attachments.

If Gandalf the White would actually be a new hero, I doubt it will be called anything but Gandalf, otherwise we will see two versions of the wizard in play. My guess would be that we would see a non-boon attachment that upgrades our ol' pal. Just look at Strider. We didn't get a Strider hero, as that would've been weird with that and Aragorn on the table. Instead we got an awesome Strider attachment.

 

I don't think a new Gandalf is unnecessary. If anything the Aragorn spam needs to slow down haha. There are so many hero versions of him, and yes half are Fellowship, but at this rate we would see a new Leadership Aragorn hero before we get a new Gandalf haha. The cycle begins anew. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] I think we will see a new Gandalf hero or ally sometime on the future. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Isn't Gandalf the White represented in campaign mode through the "Beyond All Hope" boon reward card? So, he is there but can't be used outside of the LotR saga sets, isn't that a bit more thematic since none of the other quests take place after LotR?

 

I guess another thing that could show up is a Gandalf the White Ally that requires the fellowship sphere?

Actually thinking about it I doubt we'd even see a fellowship Gandalf the white unless he is the hero. Since you could use a Gandalf the White fellowship ally before the Balrog or any sphere/neutral version of him if one was made. I think I'm in the camp that it won't happen and I see why. Might be interesting to get a two sided Gandalf hero but the perfect time for that has passed.

What of the last box, I mean the battle outside the Black Gate? Will it be represented only as a side of a quest with the Ring-bearer the Fellowship hero or are we gonna get two (or even more) Fellowship heroes in the last box? I certainly hope Morannon is one quest of the last three, and given how little there is to choose from (considering the end is the destruction of Barad-dur, and not Scouring of the Shire), it probably will be. A wild option would be to have both Frodo and Sam as Ring-bearers and both Aragorn and Gandalf as the other Fellowship heroes...

For those who wander whether we are getting new Merry and Pip:

>  
> 
>  
> 
> you'll find new boons that allow you to swear your fealty to either Gondor or Rohan

So it'll be done same as Beyond all Hope, but I hope we'll see some interesting effects that work really well with them- preferably with both their versions.

 

Eowin hero was a real shock for me (nice one, still). I firmly believed that we are getting Eomer and Imrahil. Now I hope we'll get Arwen's banner, Beregond, ally/hero Eomer and halbarad. I'm not sure if I want ally twins- I'd prefer to have another hero versions of them (allies are less relliable to get on a table), and I doubt we'll get 3 of them.

 

Does anybody guess what this Eowin's event Stronger than Steel could do? After you kill opponent ready a hero would work well with her ability, but we have plenty of similar effects already.

Scouring of the Shire has a very low chance of being in the sixth box now, because of The Tower of Cirith Ungol, Mount Doom, and The Black Gate being the probable quests for the final box. At least we can hope for a fellowship quest.

I suppose it's possible they won't have The Black Gates as a quest in the final saga box, as quests that focus on the hobbits tend to not mix with others in a saga.

 

They could then throw in the gates as a fellowship or GenCon quest, like they did with Fog on the Barrow-downs and The Old Forest.

 

But as Kakita notes, that would leave us with a fellowship sphere hero without a One Ring. Personally, I don't think that would matter much. Fellowship Aragorn didn't need the Ring to be useful.

Unlikely. I think since story-wise, the Battle of the Morannon and the destruction of the One Ring by the Ring-bearer have to happen concurrently, there will be one quest involving both. We already have The Breaking of the Fellowship, in which one player controls Frodo for the duration of the quest. Or one of the Hobbit quests where Bilbo is off by himself answering riddles. It seems doable to have the main quest require Fellowship Aragorn + the players, and a different quest/objective requiring only the Ring-bearer. Edited April 29, 2016 by Network57

The latter gives you the time you have to destroy the ring in the final quest, the former affects how many enemies you see.

True. What I like about that approach is that it mirrors the sequene in the books. The Black Gate chapter ends with the troll dropping on Pippin and him falling unconscious, and we don't really know if it was enough until we've followed Frodo and Sam through Mordor.

Really? That's very lame. Normally I wouldn't care about a box, but with all the BS surrounding the controversial decision from Asmode (and therefore FFG) to curb online sales, increasing prices across the board for everyone, I'm annoyed they're cutting corners. They want to label themselves as a luxury brand, not some generic store brand product. Cool, I get that. But why am I paying more than before and getting less? You can't just cut corners and charge a premium price. That's like a luxury car manufacturer slapping on their hood ornaments on cheap used cars they acquired and charging you the full premium price.

I wonder who the other hero in the box will be now that we know for a fact it won't be Denethor...
Potentially Eomer or Imrahil after all!

My bet was tatics Eowyn and spirit Denethor. Technically still possible :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Apart from dreaming, I will now go for Eomer Leadership. The Spoilers made it look like for me, that the box is more about rushing to aid Gondor than playing the defense yourself. Eomer fits this better. And he doesn't fit Spirit or lore.

I have a mind for Imrahil, the problem is that i thought he could be tactics which won't since there is Eowyn, so Leadership Eomer could be an option

That'd be interesting for making this the ultimate pack in sphere bleed if nothing else, with 4 willpower in Tactics and 4 defence in Spirit.

Haha yeah I did think that. Still though in terms of pure theme he would be a good fit. Maybe we'll get spirit Halbarad? I still don't think we'll see 2 Rohan heroes in this box.

Well, though as mentioned a 4 def and 0 quest Spirit hero seems awkward, maybe an attachment that turns his def in questing power could make the deal

I too do not believe there will be two Rohan heroes

So "The Flame of the West" is currently in development but what next after that ? I really hope we can get "The Battle of Dale" as a part of the saga or standalone scenario because we could get some nice cards there :

 

" During the War of the Ring, the Eastelings crossed the border and moved to attack the city. On 17 March 3019 the Battle  of Dale began. Not able to hold back the Easterlings the Men of Dale and their allies, the Dwarves of Erebor, retreated into the the Lonely Mountain, but lost Kings Brand and Dáin Ironfoot who were both slain at the Gate of Erebor. For seven days the Men and Dwarves barricaded themselves in Erebor until news came from the south of the defeat of Sauron. The new kings of Dale and Erebor (Bard II and Thorin III Stonehelm), broke the siege and chased the Easterlings out of Dale. "

Yes! I want that  now!

 

 

An objective ally who will at least stop people from playing hero Dain on at lest one scenario!

Dain Ironfoot

5 will

5 atk

5 def

5 hp

Dwarf Warrior Noble King

 

Ranged Sentinel

 

After a dwarf ally enters play, draw three cards, reduce your threat to 0 and add one resource to each heroes rescurce pool.

Each dwarf character gains +1 will, atk and def. When Dain Ironfoot is ready, each dwarf instead gains +2 will, atk and def. After a dwarf character exhausts, ready that character. Then, Heal damage from it (limit twice per character per round).

 

When Dain Ironfoot leaves play, search your deck, hand, discard pile and all other places where you store allies and put all dwarf allies into play.

I'm guessing leadership Eomer for the Flame of the West.  The saga boxes are supposed to be stand alone, and core + saga players currently have no Eomer at all, and he's a far more important figure in the Return of the King (and before) than Imrahil.

I too like many others would absolutely love to get a Battle of Erebor or Destruction of Dol Guldur POD quest that can also tie in to the Saga Campaign. There had better be scouring of the shire in either the last deluxe box or as a POD quest as well!

This isn't the movies and the Scouring is a very important part of the narrative. I would be fairly upset if it was omitted altogether..

Wow, that would be a good idea for an "extra saga", having three quests that were happening in the end: and there are a few options: Dale/Erebor, Lórien/Dol Guldur, Mirkwood. Scouring best fit for a con quest, I feel.

Battle of Dale/Erebor and destruction of Dol Guldur would be great. But I don't think you should tie them into the campaign, as they are "side-events" and none of the characters from the main story participate. Therefore I don't find it Fitting that our heroes would.

 

Scourging on the other Hand fits perfectly as it is an important part. To Keep Fellowship Frodo useful you could creat an objective attachment "free from the burden", that enables Frodos abilities like the ring does (maybe without the downsides). I think you should cut all of the previous burdens, too (no more Sauron :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

You could still tie them into the campaign: give the players a free hero change in both the Setup and Resolution instructions on the campaign card.  This way you can include a boon.

I still think the best plan would be Cirith Ungol, March Across Gorgoroth, and the Battle of the Morannon + Cracks of Doom for the last box. And Scouring as a Saga POD that still uses burdens from the Treason of Isengard.

New forum user. This is (obviously*) overpowered, but a new version of Ironfoot would be much appreciated. Seems like all the decks built with him end up feeling stale- like it doesn't matter which heros you use with him. 

 

Ally: Leadership 

 

W. 1

atk. 2

def.3

h.p. 3

Dwarf. Noble. Warrior.

cost:4

 

When put into play, each player draws a card. 

When defending against an enemy with orc keyword, he gets +2 def.

 

Also, unrelated, can't wait to get the new Eowyn. Rohan is my fav. trait

With regards to Caldara and Prince Imrahil, how soon does his passive text take place?  Coming from Thrones background, the exact timing of paying costs and potential passive conditions being implemented make me question everything and often.

 

Caldara: Action: Discard Caldara to put 1 spirit ally from your discard.... 

 

The COST is "Discard Caldara" and the EFFECT is to "put 1 spirit ally .... "

 

Prince Imrahil has the passive text of "While there is a hero card in your discard pile, ... " he becomes a Hero.  As soon as Caldara's ability is triggered, she is placed in the discard pile. Then you get your X number of allies.     At what juncture does this take place?

I would imagine his effect won't be active until he is in play. Unless it's called out (like some Noldor cards) I don't think cards are active or considered in play while they're in the discard pile.

No one suggested that Imrahil could be out of play.  The question is whether when Caldara self-sacrifices, does an in-play Imrahil count as a hero or not?  It's not obvious to me at all what the ruling will be.

## 166 [Slothgodfather on July 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218379-flame-of-the-west-new-saga/?do=findComment&comment=2317599)

Yea sorry, I'm not trying to put him into play with Caldara.  He would already be in play.  So when I activate her ability and she goes into the discard pile, do I have 2 or 3 heroes when resolving here effect.

 

Her ability has an active point of initiation, but his ability is basically just sitting around waiting for the condition to be met and seemingly constantly checks "are you there yet?" so I'm not sure if it simply waits until her ability finishes resolving or if it is immediate after paying the cost for her ability.

The text on Caldara's action says "Each other hero you control" instead of just "Each hero you control" which could indicate she is still in your control when you are resolving her action. If that's true, then Imrahil does not work since she is in your control and therefore not in your discard pile yet.

Oh, I misread the question. My bad (helps if I had my cup of coffee first haha). hmm... that's a tricky one. Reading the FAQ on lasting effects, it states "A lasting effect created by a player card ability must be calculated at the time that the ability is triggered, and that effect is not recalculated if the game state changes."

 

Because Imrahil's ability is neither a response or action, it's just there waiting for that trigger, I would say yeah he becomes a hero the moment you pay Caldara's cost but before her ability resolves giving you 3 heroes for the effect.

Thinking more about the Caldara/Imrahil thing, I am not sure that Elfhelm even has a "printed resource icon" at all, even when he becomes a hero. In the rulebook where it breaks down the parts of a card, only Hero cards have Resource Icons, with allies actually having a "Sphere of Influence Icon". It's nitpicky, but seems pretty clear to me looking at the rulebook that those icons are called different things. This would mean he wouldn't work for Map of Earnil and Pelargir Shipwright either!

Remembering the article that introduced Sword-thain, it was pointed out pretty clear by the developer that ally with Sword-thain is considered a hero with the printed icon of his sphere.

According to that logic, Sword-Thain wouldn't work either, because it just changes the card type.

 

Also in the rulebook, you can only spend resources from a hero that has a matching resource icon.  I guess you can't spend resources from Sword-Thain'ed allies either.

I am thinking about a deck with Beorn and Prince Imrahil ally.

 

When Beorn is destroyed, Prince Imrahil become a hero and give more spirit resources for Fortune and Fate.

How would the ally Prince Imrahil interact with either of his hero versions in campaign mode (especially since the ally version is being released in a saga box)?  Let's say hero Prince Imrahil dies (or better yet gets discarded, say, to take down the Balrog) but you're able to play his ally version before the end of the game.  At the end of the game, hero Prince Imrahil is in your discard pile, but there is technically a hero Prince Imrahil in play because of the ally's ability.  Does he get added to your list of fallen heroes, or do you get to use his hero version again in future quests?

It looks like he gets added to your fallen heroes list and you can no longer use him.

If Imrahil ally (being a hero for a change) dies, I believe, he immediately becomes ally again, just as he leaves play, and thus is not counted among fallen heroes.

Sure, but that wasn't the question, if I am not mistaken. Problem is: If you use HERO Imrahil and he dies but you Play ALLY imrahil who stays alive till the of the quest (as a hero) is imrahil considered a fallen hero or not (as he is alive and dead)? As the rules state any hero is considered fallen, who is in a discard pile at the end of the game, so it should be save to say, that imrahil would be added to the list.

You could justify it as saying that he took a fatal wound but, like Boromir in the books, was able to continue to fight a little while before he succumbed to his wounds. Thus, he continues to help you until the end of the current game, but he's unavailable for the rest of the campaign as he died heroically helping complete the previous quest.

Same philosophy here. That's what will happen in my campaign if I have to sacrifice a hero to the Balrog and that hero is really important for the deck. And the worst thing is that those other boons are so cool.

You have to consider that each product costs more so it's not just a $5.50 increase.  And yes, the value that the product provides is now less than the price it is listed for (for me).  Can I afford it? Sure.  Is it worth it? No.

 

When you increase the price of a product, you decrease demand for it.  It is expected, not surprising, that some consumers will exit the market when the price increases.

Yeah the price hike sucks. If I wasn't so invested in LotR LCG and I like the community/designers for this game, I would've stopped buying FFG products altogether. It's a good thing the rest of their catalog doesn't interest me (except for AH LCG, another co-op/solo LCG is exciting).

It seems to have gone up in at least one of the Manchester stores, but that is probably to do with the devaluation of the pound.

Played through all three quests for the first time yesterday (finally, after not managing to try them out for several days!).

Overall some fun new quests, though I beat each one on the first attempt, without coming close to losing in any game, which is a little disappointing (though, in fairness, I was playing Denethor/Erestor/Hirluin, which does tend to be pretty strong).

I need to rebuild my campaign decks and try out the campaign mode version.

I don't mind reading this. In fact, I like it. As long as the thematic and epicness element is intact, I actually prefer easier quests. Unlike with what happens in many other quests, I really enjoy being able to play 3 or 4 rounds before I get destroyed.

I just got my copy and beat all 3 quests last night.  4 player Passing of the Grey Company took 2 tries, and our win was with 2 people at 49 threat.  I can see how that quest would be a lot easier solo because you can detach Overcome by Fear every turn instead of waiting 4 turns to get your chance again.  Then 2 player Siege of Gondor went fairly smoothly.  We beat it in 5 turns, which I think is as fast as possible.  

 

Then 3 player Pelennor Fields was crazy epic.  I was playing a Dunedain deck and had 5 enemies forest snared by the end.  Killed the Witch King with just 2 Fornost Bowmen who were attacking for 10 each.  We also accidentally played with the wrong side of the Witch King during stage 3, which I'm pretty sure made it harder.  Finished with 56 damage on Minas Tirith (60 damage and you lose), but there is a good chance I missed at least 4 damage worth of triggers.  So there are several asterisks to that victory.  There is so much going on in that quest, it's impossible to not make mistakes at least in 3-4 player.

 

I'm pretty sure Pelennor Fields will be even harder in campaign mode.  You don't get Aragorn for at least 5 turns and then you have to add the extra enemies at the end.

Played through Passing of the Grey Company last night in campaign mode. Not too challenging, but really fun and thematic. You can really quest all out (and you kind of have to), because if can you afford to eat some threat you dont have to defend. One of my decks was a Gandalf deck that started at 35 threat and just finished in time, and the other was a Merry, Eowyn, Theoden deck that ate as much of the threat as possible. There's extra incentives to shoot for in campaign mode: keeping Overcome by Fear off your threat dial at all costs, and earning the Army of the Dead boon, which new Eowyn got for me in one shot. Good start to the box. Hoping to play the other two quests tonight.

I played it with an Erestor deck, so I didn't particularly care!

I play two-handed, FYI.

 

Played quests two and three yesterday for the first time.  Beat Siege of Gondor on the first try and got the best possible result (only five rounds to finish), but it was a near thing.  Basically had my entire fellowship at the damage max and had to YOLO quest to victory on the last turn or everyone would die.  The whole idea is to explore ship locations so that you have a small conquered Corasiar fleet to sail to Gondor.  Every time you travel to a ship, a Corsair enemy comes out of the encounter deck and bad things happen (they gain archery or their engagement cost is reduced).  There's loads of direct damage from the enemies and the main objective, which either pumps out direct damage or causes and extra encounter card to be revealed.  It wasn't a hard quest, and if you aren't playing it in campaign mode (so that you're driven to finish), I think it would be pretty easy.  However, campaign mode also made it easier, because I could fetch Anduril for new Aragorn on turn one and I had Army of the Dead out too.  It's a fairly forgettable scenario, perhaps overshadowed by the fact that we are fighting Corsairs in memorable battles during the current cycle.

 

Battle of the Pelennor Fields was really tough and it kicked my butt.  I made a bad decision to avoid questing early so that I could deal with some of the enemies in the staging area (and there are a lot of them!), but the damage piled up so fast on Minas Tirith it was shocking.  It's extra hard in campaign mode because when you get to the last stage, all of those Haradrim that are in the campaign log from the Black Gate come out to party.  It's got lots of neat elements going on from stage to stage as it tries to capture all of the epic things that happened during the battle.  One of the things that surprised me is how quickly it went.  I was expecting a long, drawn out siege like Helm's Deep, but this is nothing like that.  There's a pause where you have a short time to build up forces, and then it's on as enemies upon enemies invade from Mordor.  From that point on, you have to figure out how to best make a dent in their forces as they relentlessly assault the city.  If you're not careful, the encounter deck will end things quickly (or end you quickly).  My two decks breezed through the first two scenarios,but will probably need some major revisions if I'm going to beat this quest.

 

More than any of the other boxes so far, I feel like this expansion relies on the campaign to be good.  Which is fine!  I love campaign mode and have had an ongoing campaign for years now that I pick back up when a new box comes out.  A lot of the challenge in the first two scenarios comes from wanting the optimum results for late scenarios.  In Passing of the Grey Company, it's avoiding Overcome by Fear and earning Army of the Dead.  In Siege of Gondor it's finishing as fast as possible, which means risking lots of enemy attacks.  In Battle of the Pelennor, it's: have I done well in the campaign so far? If I have, this is manageable.  If I haven't, it will be nigh impossible.  Pelennor is most definitely the best stand alone scenario in the box, but Passing of the Grey Company will probably get the most play from me.  It's fun, it's thematic and just different enough to feel fresh.

Yeah, that's a good strategy. I did go however with a more (almost) thematic deck for the first quest : http://www.ringsdb.com/deck/view/19720 [http://www.ringsdb.com/deck/view/19720]

General agreement on this after my 1st attempt at Pelennor Fields tonight (non-campaign). I brought a power Gandalf deck and what I think of as a reverse-colored Rohan-Beregond deck (Tactics Theoden and Eowyn with Spirit Beregond). This is how close I came... **Slight spoilers**

47/50 damage on Minas Tirith. Witch King in the victory display. 14 quest progress to win. 2 cards to reveal. Test of Will in hand. I yolo-quest, since Grond is going to lose me the game next turn. But that gives me like a 35 excess progress cushion. Staging:

* Location that cancels Test of Will.

* Surging enemy.

* Surging enemy.

* Surging enemy.

* Treachery that either deals 5 damage to Minas Tirith (auto-loss) or 1 to each exhausted character.

Due to the horrid archery I've been taking throughout, the 2nd choice directly causes 17 of my characters to die. I do not make it.

I love this game.

Do you believe that a deck with Tac Eowyn, Sp Beregond and Halbarad , with all the attachments needed to give Fellowship Aragorn all these sphaires (Roheryn, StwB and Celebrians Stone) and SoG for resources, would be possible to have a success on these or it takes to much time to build up?

Spoilers for details on the Pelennor Fields quest in this post.

 

Played The Battle of the Pelennor Fields for the first time tonight.  I was playing 2-handed in my campaign (so hero death is unacceptable) with Gimli/Eowyn(T)/Beravor and Amarthiul/Elfhelm/Beregond(S).

 

A heartbreaking loss.  I was doing very well, and probably would have won on my first go.  The 2nd stage had Gandalf and Mablung as allies in the staging area, which meant I had 7 damage to buffer me.  I would have delayed there had I realized what came next, but I got through in 2 turns (I was playing blind).  Still I did very well.  Gimli was swinging for 11 with a Rohan Warhorse attached.  Beregond and Amarthiul both had 6 defense with an Armoured Destrier each.  Aragorn was in play and I had Visionary Leadership and Faramir on the table amid a swarm of Gondor allies.

 

I had a War Mumak engaged and was going to kill it (it had 6 damage on it).  Beregond was defending for 6, and the shadow card that came up was the Shadow of Fear burden -- defending character does not count its defense.  I used every trick I had, including all my Boons, Beravor, a copy of Heed the Dream (could only pay the Lore cost for it), Campfire Tales, and in the end drew 9 cards.  I even used Old Bogey Stories to try to get the Beravor deck to draw into a copy of Deep Knowledge so I could get 2 more cards (didn't work).  I was trying to draw into a Sneak Attack so I could play Gandalf and kill the Mumak.  No dice.  I drew a Hasty Stroke but it was too late to play it.  Beregond was killed.  After, just for giggles I shuffled the deck and looked at the top card -- Sneak Attack.

Sounds like a truly epic game! 

Should have chosen Pursued by the Enemy instead huh?  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] 
I have never once chosen Shadow of Fear and I never will. 

Losing the text box of each and every single character in play even just for a turn is just awful. No abilities, no ranged, no sentinel. Perhaps because I have always used decks that focus on strong character abilities and usually excel at destroying enemies sooner rather than later Shadow of Fear seems so much worse than pursued by the enemy. 
I struggle to think of a worse encounter effect to be honest. 

and yeah that shadow effect is potentially even worse. It essentially makes the attack undefended but you still exhausted a defender to it.

Yeah, that shadow has botched many games for me.  The blanking I can deal with, as it has minimal effect on, say, a willpower Gondor army and characters with "gravy" abilities like hero Faramir, Mablung, and Damrod (as opposed to an ability on a character who would be neutered by a blank text box, like the twins).

Had my first attempt on passage. My heroes where Eowyn (T), Beregond (S), Halbarad. My deck was thematic for the whole box (had Rohan, Gondor and Dunedain) since i played for my campaign.

Won snd also had army of the dead in Victory display. My final threat was 48 and that was thanks to Beregond for lowering it when he defended undamaged. Tried to have always an enemy engaged for this. Ally Faramir was of hreat help for quest too.

Aragorn version of the box can become very strong with attachments.

The quest was more on the easy side i guess but liked it. The early discard is tough though

Played the siege of Gondor, same deck. I was lucky to have SoG kai StwB on my opening hand and on turn three Aragorn had them both. Army of the dead helped a lot and Eowyn with the Golden shield and UC was questing and defending as well as Beregond. Halbarad was helping questing and attack.

The quest was easy, at least for my deck, though it was thematic and the only reason i could replay it is just because i had 7 tokens on corsair fleet ... There where a couple of turns that no ship location was coming from the encounter deck.

Next will be the battle of pelennor fields, in which i might change a lot of cards in my deck, especially since Aragorn will come late and all his attachments might be of no use

You won't like the answer I'm afraid.  Elladan, Elrohir & ... Arwen.  She was there "in spirit".  Ba-dum-pum.

 

That lineup/deck isn't working on the next quest yet though.  There is SO much incidental damage and chump blocking needed that I will need a pretty major revision to the deck.

Had my victory tonight (long play report follows!)

 

Decks wer Gimli (Tactics), Eowyn (Tactics), and Beravor on one side, and Amarthiul, Elfhelm, and Beregond (Spirit) on the other.

 

I won handily.  Got Steward on round 1 (thanks to Beravor, I think) and a Citadel Plate in play by the second round, when combat would start.  I stalled on stage 2 (allies were Gandalf and a Veteran of Osgiliath) for a good long time, and owned the board state. Not that many locations came out, which was lucky, and I killed both Wraiths on Wings before advancing to stage 3, which finally I did by choice.  Aragorn also arrived before the Witch King.  

 

Stage 3 passed very quickly -- on the first round I had only 1 enemy engaged, I think, and put 2 progress down (or I had more and cleared the active location +put 2 progress down, I forget).  Next round I had 4 enemies and no active location, and plunked down 8 more on the quest, bringing me 2 shy of advancing.  Next round the Witch King's effect discarded and added to the staging area The Black Serpent, which was lucky because it avoided his When Revealed immediate attack. I opted not to travel -- my options were Grond, which meant 2 attacks from the Witch King, or a Siege Tower, which would have shuffled the discard pile (including nasty shadow effects) back into the nearly empty encounter deck. I elected not to travel, and kept Grond in the staging area for the remainder of the game.  Gimli made short work of The Black Serpent and I advanced to stage 4.  

 

I had a long planning phase because I needed healing or risked defeat.  All of the tactics deck's heroes were within 1 point of defeat; a Shadow of Mordor would have defeated me.  I did some card draw shenanigans but came up empty, so I used my Three Golden Hairs boon, which thematically was attached to Gimli.  I drew into a healer, played and used him immediately.  Healed 1 point of damage on Eowyn and 1 on Beravor.  Quest phase was a double reveal of Shadow of Mordor, so they got their damage right back (thanks, Galadriel!).  

 

The leadership deck engaged the Witch King on stage 5 and made very quick work of him.  During the encounter phase he attacked and killed a Defender of Rammas who had Sentinel thanks to Arwen, then a Sneak Attack Gandalf provided the second defense.  Aragorn and the Gondor gang piled on the Witch King with all those +1 attacks from the Banner of Elendil, and dispatched him readily (sadly, Eowyn did not get her moment).  Next round I quested to victory without incident.  With Aragorn plus Banner of Elendil and Sword that was Broken, Visionary Leadership and Faramir, you can get up some s.e.r.i.o.u.s willpower.  

 

I realized later that I totally forgot to add my campaign enemy from Journey to the Cross-roads once I hit stage 5, but it was a single Man of Harad and my board state was so strong that certainly it made no difference.

Nice report and good job on your victory! Took me three attempts in the end, was this your second after that first you posted about?

We actually had some VERY similar experiences! I had the Black Serpent appear from the Witch Kings effect as well avoiding his when revealed effect. Also I forgot to include my set aside campaign enemy from Journey to the Cross-roads as well the first two attempts (but remembered the third time when I won) and for me it was a single copy of Man of Harad as well!!! 

I had far more trouble with the Wraith's on Wings and Witch King however. Didn't have anywhere near as much willpower as it sounds like you had so I had to commit multiple characters I would have liked to save for additional offensive and defensive power to questing instead t on most turns and had to carefully and specifically hold back from questing in order to dispatch the Witch King towards the end.

Played first attempt on the battle. Reached stage three but when the effect of of Witch King revealed a Mumak and the card i drew on staging was also a mumak (two in a raw) i dumped it.

Have a question. Since there is no ringbearer in game, do i shuffle brace of coneys in my deck? I guess not but want to be sure

You can shuffle Brace of coneys in your deck for this scenario, but it's absurd. The problem is, since there is no ring-bearer in play during the game (Aragorn has not the ring bearer trait), you will never been able to play the card. (The condition on the boon is : Play only if you control the Ring-bearer.) So no point to add this card at all.

 

Had a victory too last night with a friend on the Battle of the Pelennor Fields. :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

He played an Arwen / Elladan / Elrohir deck. Lot of resources on Elrohir, with quickly 2 Dunedain Warning on him + elven mail. He saved us with 6 defence on a single turn!!

 

I played a Galadriel / Lanwyn / Haldir Deck. With 3 scouting party an a lot of scout allies. Water of Nimrodel was very useful.

Aragorn arrived at turn 8,it very late. But he saved us! We 've been lucky when my friend drawn an Elrond Council  when he was at 48 threat.

And 3 Mumak killed!

Rivendell Blade + Straight shot = Mumak killer combo  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It took my 4 tries after everything.   Two were scrapped by the Shadow of Fear shadow effect.  The third I threated out on round 3 or so after a 13-point threat increase in the quest phase, just didn't get willpower down fast enough and was forced on to stage 3 with all that threat in the staging area.  The time I won, with all my willpower boosting effects out, I had +4 willpower on some characters, so my Envoys of Pelargir were questing for 5 each! 

 

I did not read Brace of Coneys since I earned it months ago, did not realize you needed the Ring-bearer!  Well, I definitely cheated there, as I used it to lower threat by 2 and draw 2 cards early in the game.  I doubt I will go back and play again now, though.

Had the most epic fail I ever had

 

Was playing the battle of pelennor fields

 

Stalled for 4 turns on stage 2, which helped me play allies Legolas, Gimli, Deorwyn, Ingold and a couple chump blockers (Good harvest and Tight your belts -or how it is called, helped a lot). At some point Gamling who was on stage area died cause I did not engaged an enemy for a couple of turns and so I went stage 3. Witch King, Grond etc, the first enemy that the Witch Kings ability discarded is a Mumak and the encounter card is the Black Serpant ... I also have Raith on WIngs engaged. 

 

While on the second turn on this stage Aragorn joined and I managed to defeat Raith on Wings -who had 5 resources on- next turn Black Serpant (keep this in mind). I continue to play and after 4 turns (6 total in stage 3) I manage to get to stage 4 when I quested with a questing power of 30 (Faramir was in etc) ... Next turn I lost cause Grond was still in staging area and since on stage 4 there is no Witch King to attack I guess I cannot travel to Grond - is this correct btw or I could travel? I guess not - Minas Tirith was destroyed ... then a flash comes in my mind ... progress on stage 3 is placed by the encounter power of enemies killed, not by questing succesfull ... thus just on second turn on stage 3 I should have progressed on stage 4 saving myself of lots of archery, combat damage and most, damage on Minas Tirith (I am playing solo)

 

I feel like I never want to play again  :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

The first attempt I had I managed to get to the very end, had the witch king almost defeated and almost enough progress on the last stage. Minas Tirith was on 48 damage or something ridiculous (playing two handed so it has 50 total health).

All of a sudden I realise I had been ignoring the effect on the Mordor Orcs and had been placing undefended attack damage on heroes instead of Minas Tirith. In reality I had most likely lost a few turns prior....

I was pretty disheartened...

Then I played another game and had an epic but really fun loss, then third attempt I managed an epic win!

Its a hard quest but stick with it because victory is usually pretty epic on this one when you do achieve it!

You are right, I know ... it is just that I might have won the quest if I was playing correctly, I damaged my whole attempt cause I did not pay attention on the card

 

I love it as a quest, it is tough and my hero line up while perfect for the first two has a little weakness here, plus that I have 7 resources on Corsair Fleet thus Aragorn comes a bit late. Also on the six games I had so far in Pelennor Fields, three of them I had the Black Arrow attached on a hero on stage two or three which with no healing in my deck makes things nearly impossible.

My biggest problem though are Mumaks, I might change a few cards to take Rivendell blade and straight shot for ally Legolas that I have in my deck already.

Ok, tried again and won. I think my most difficult part was to stall as much as possible on stage two. My ally was Deorwine which helped. Beregond was a beastcin defence and kept threat low, Eowyn used its ability to help kill Wraith on Wings, Halbarad was questing and attacking each turn while from stage 3 and on i had Legolas, Gimli, Faramir, Grimbold and Ingold allies on table with some other Rohan cheap ones. Pure theme

On stage 4 i could do 23 damage but there were not that many enemies in play (apart from a mumak which could get only three)

Epic quest!!!

Wooooo! I just had to crow about a win I just had against Siege of Gondor.

The only wins I've had against this quest involved balls-to-the-wall willpower decks, but for some reason I decided to take a Silvan/Noldor fellowship of two decks against it instead. Moreover, the Silvan deck was Celeborn-Legolas-Argalad, which meant that it was not a heavy quester (compared to Silvan decks that use Galadriel, at least).

I'm not sure I've ever been so doubly lucky and unlucky in a game. Unlucky because it took me forever to find certain cards, like Elven-light and O Lorien (which actually sits in the heavily-drawing Noldor deck, which moreover has 3x Rivendell Minstrel, so it was shocking it took so long). When I finally played O Lorien, it was just a round or two before a shadow effect discarded it, ugh. Meanwhile, the Tactics Silvan deck couldn't find a weapon for the life of it, so its intended Straight Shot abuse was entirely for naught: 3x Straight Shot sat in my hand nearly all game. And Silvan Tracker, who could've been so excellent with all the direct damage in the quest, never hit the table either.

At the same time, the roulette spin that Silvans can be hit money over and over and over. Do I need to Tree People into a Galadhrim Minstrel into a Feigned Voices in order to survive...? Sure, that can happen. Will the usually least-useful Silvan event, Pursuing the Enemy, repeatedly get me the last damage I need to avoid deadly attacks? Yup! I need to draw into a Galadhrim Healer RIGHT NOW. Oh, there she is.

In the end, with 11 (!) damage on the Corsair Fleet, I YOLO quested with everyone except Legolas and found myself... two short. Four undefended attacks and four dead heroes later, Legolas -- good ol' Core set Legolas, not a single attachment on him -- fired off a single Ranged arrow at an 8HP Umbar Pirate Crew who'd been slowly but surely softened up by repeated Argalad'ings and a Gandalf bomb... It plinked for that last point of needed damage to destroy it, and Legolas calmly put the last two progress on the quest for the win. What a boss.

I've never felt so simultaneously undeserving and deserving of a win. Good thing this wasn't in campaign mode!

(Also: Dunedain Remedy is good, yo. I only had it for a couple of rounds before it too was discarded to a shadow effect, but in those two rounds, it healed a ridiculous amount of damage.)

Nice write-up, sounds like an awesome game.  I like the Dunedain Remedy card very much, although I haven't played with it yet.  Is that the first healing card that isn't Lore? (excluding boons)

Finally got around to trying this one and it is brutal. Glad to know it's not just me! Congrats on your win.

 

I'm wondering if a supar secrat Hobbit deck would work, since you must quest to win. I mean to try this solo this weekend.

In The Passing of the Grey Company, if an enemy with the Phantom keyword attacks and you raise your threat as a result, do you also have to count excess damage dealt by that attack, or can it never be more than the HP of the defending character?

I did something similar with a Gondor deck.

 

Banner of Elendil + Sword that Was Broken + Visionary Leadership + Faramir (core) + cheap Gondor allies. Keep threat low with sneak+Gandalf and quest past everything. I took the damage for the first 3 rounds and took the extra card for each round after. It worked pretty well. Really fun to have your Squires of the Citadel questing for 4 each!

> Mono-Leadership?

 

It was Leadership Denethor, Leadership Boromir, and Lore Pippin, but I think you can make a better deck if you are willing to break theme a bit. Boromir's global buff wasn't too useful, so Imrahil would be another thematic option.

 

Damrod + Traps is another option, swapping him for Pippin.

Yeah, I agree that a Gondor deck can still be better when you splash Lore, although you should not underestimate the Rod of the Steward in Mono Leadership. Strange that you found Boromir's buff not too useful, as it is usually quite the contrary with my builds.

I was very pleased and impressed with this saga box. Artwork is amazing. I played the quests solo with one deck (tried a lore one splashed with spirit and then spirit with a bit of lore) :

 

Grey Company is an excellent quest with a small encounter deck, and i thought it worked great with early planning key, it kept getting tense and yes spirit cards felt like a necessity. Really enjoyed this one for solo play and think this will become a regular scenario for me to play.

 

Siege of Gondor is another small encounter deck quest which has a nice fleet attack theme fighting corsairs, but i couldn't really take to it, i think it is because you just have to beat it quickly so doesn't leave much room for changing spheres. It was pretty hard too.

 

Pelennor Fields is a one of those epic style quest with many stages, some clever design, but has quite a lot to keep track of, which i don't usually like so much, but this one had such great artwork and theme. In terms of difficulty it felt like Ruins of Belegost, a wonderful quest with such good art and cards but designed way hard for solo fun. I feel i needed to modify the Witch King so he didn't attack me (as first player) every round just to feel i had a chance and even then the archers wear me down. I did manage a good win on easy level so that is encouraging. Overall with slight rules modification i will enjoy playing again. 

 

Overall i really like this box set, heroes, theme, artwork and quests are high on the enjoyment list. I don't buy saga's generally but glad i got this one.

Pretty much exactly my review, except I'd add a bit more hate towards Siege of Gondor lol. This is the box that made me realize Campaign Mode will for the most part only be playable for power decks, which is kind of a bummer. Otherwise, yeah, the art and theme are incredible, although I don't find Pelennor to be that hard unless you get Black Dart or the Mumak or Black Serpent first round, but I agree that it's a bit too much to keep track of.

Maybe in true solo.  I play mostly solo 2-handed these days, and my decks have been thematic through the whole campaign.  Certainly you can build a "power deck" which is thematic, but I don't get that accolade.  My decks are moderately successful, wouldn't classify as power decks.  I think I won Siege on my 2nd or 3rd try, and in only 5 rounds!

Maybe in true solo? I'm sorry, but I'm not taking my secrecy hobbit deck against Pelennor without Aragorn for half the game and with extra Oliphaunts at the end (assuming I won Crossroads and Siege). Ain't nobody got time for that.
