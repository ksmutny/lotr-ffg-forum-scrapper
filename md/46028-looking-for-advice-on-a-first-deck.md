Does any one want to give advice regarding a solid first deck with which one could learn the solo game?

Use the starter decks mate.You will lose a lot but after some games you will learn the cards of each sphere well and then you can make your own decks and test them in game.This is the joy of this game.If somene tells you a good solo deck and win the scenarios fun goes away.

Thank you for the advice, I will give it a try. I was just looking more for general direction, not so much the specifics.Â  Thanks again,

If you go with spirit you should be able to defeat 1st and 2nd scenario

I would say try out the Leadership deck first, although it might spoil you on future decks! That should get you enough resources to really do about anything you want. Then, once you get a feel for the cards, as said above, you can pick a dual-sphere that feels good.
