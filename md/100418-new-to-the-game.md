Hi all

I have purchased 2 copies of the core set and a copy of hunt for golum and a copy of carrack. I am having a go at passage through mirkwood and have put together a 50 card deck (spirit/leadership) I have chosen the characters that I have avaliable with the least amount of threat level (elleanor,theodred and frodo 22 threat) I will attempt to take them through all the quests that I have.

just a couple of questions: can theodred give himself the resource when he quests?

what does the X mean in the cost part of some of the cards? (stand and fight)

thanks

regards mic

Welcome to the game!

 

X varies, of course, and in the case of Stand and Fight, the card reads that X is the cost of the ally you wish to target with the effect. So, if you have a cost 4 ally in your discard pile and you wish to put it into play, X = 4. Hope that helps!

 

And Theodred can give himself moneys :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
