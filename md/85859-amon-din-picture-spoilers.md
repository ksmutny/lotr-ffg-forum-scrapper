Video is cool as always. Player cards also cool! encounter card and quest idea is very weak. Sounds like nothing really intersting and very easy and boring....

Morgul Vale we wait......and Assault in Osgiliath. Blood of Gondor sounds also boring for me.

Wow. A lot of flavorful cards with useful - but very situational/deck-dependent - abilities. Great cards, yet very few would really fit well into any decks I currently run. I really like how the hobbit decks are starting to become more practical, though. One or two more cards that work well with Hobbits and I might have to try them out.

oh yes- a hobbit deck is the first thing im building when i get pippin. of course they wont see their true strength until black rider at least, but im certainly taking them through the easier quests.

****, art on Denethor just looks so fantastic.

Crossing my fingers that Gondor trait will hit it off soon so Denethor can be a part of power house deck.

For Ithinilien Pit, would this allow for the attached enemy to be targeted in the staging area?

absolutely loving the art on ithilien archer, easily my favorite art from this AP.  On the other side of things encounter deck wise, i like how brutish Ghulat looks...him holding the decapitated head is just superb

## 11 [richsabre on July 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85859-amon-din-picture-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=808924)

yes i agree on the orc...very nice. though i dont think it quite beats mountain goblin or bolg vanguard/bodyguard for me...those 3 are the best enemy art i think

Why didn't they just add, "Play Lord of Morthond directly to Hirluin" to the text on the card???  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I suppose eventually, it will be decent on Boromir....

Seems to be only useful in a outland deck. Sure you can play it on Boromir but Hurluin will probably be by his side. You could use songs or Aragorn with the stone and ring, but boy that's a lot of set up.

Yes archer looks amazing. Really love art in this game. Mych better then decipher tcg and even better the meccg. But still meccg have a cool special style
