The rules for Defense indicate you compare Willpower against Threat however the Objective Card has the Keyword Siege on it..

yes, but the quest does not. I think it's just for thematic purposes and maybe OT will be targeted by some cards in nightmare version.

That "Siege" is a Trait, not a Keyword, so it won't have any impact on the quest.

addendum/thematic complaint:  Why aren't HD quests Sieges?!?  If ever there was a case to be made for using the Siege keyword...

I actually assumed it would be, and that Erkenbrand and Warden of Helm's Deep from Antlered Crown would be thematic aces in this scenario.

Exactly what I was thinking. :-\

Just wait 'til Nightmare Mode and the inevitable treachery that changes the quest to a Siege quest.... yuck.

I can't even find time for non-saga scenarios :-/

It makes more sense now that the treason of saruman rulebook doesn't explain the siege rule. I was really confused that there was a rule ("siege") that I had to look up additionally for this quest (I don't own Heris of Numenor).  

@Grandspleen: Thanks for the clarification!
