# [Westfolder Outrider + Chief Turch  ?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110080-westfolder-outrider-chief-turch/)

What happens if you discard the outrider to engage Chief Turch ? Does he engage you, or does he stay engaged with the first player ?

 

The text on his card reads "engages the first player", but when ? Is this a continual passive ability (he is always engaged with the first player) or a one time effect at the passing of the first player token ?

I asked the question to Caleb.

And here's the answer :

> If a player used a card effect to engage Chief Turch, he would remove 1 time counter for that engagement. Then, Chief Turch’s passive effect would immediately cause him to engage the first player again, removing another time counter for a total of 2 time counters removed.

That's a nice move, then.
