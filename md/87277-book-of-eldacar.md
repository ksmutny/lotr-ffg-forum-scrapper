"Action: Discard Book of Eldacar to play any [tactics] event card in your discard pile as if it were in your hand. Then, place that event on the bottom of your deck."

Â 

Just to confirm: to play an event card as if it were in your hand means you still have to pay the resources to play the event itself?

Yes you still need to pay for the event.
