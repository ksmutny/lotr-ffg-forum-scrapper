As a newbie, I wanted to know that after an Event card is brought into the player's area and used, does it stay in play (so it can be used again) or is it discarded?

 

Thanks

Event cards does not enter play.

When you play them, you discard them (you can see it as if it is part of the cost) when the effects are resolved.
