How does Elwing's Flight work, if you can only ready one character but you have a copy of Elwing's Flight in your discard pile?

Presumably you can target a ready character with Elwing's Flight, as long as it's a questing character. The character would get +1 [W] for every time it got targeted.

## 3 [PocketWraith on January 16, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1995237)

It depends whether saying "Do X and Y" means that X and Y are two separate effects which happen to the same target (in which case you can target the willpower boost on a ready character) or intrinsically linked to each other to essentially be one effect that does two things (in which case you can't, it's all or nothing).

## 4 [shosuko on January 17, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1995270)

(1.15) The word “then” If a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve.

 

I think that since this is "and" you don't have to successfully ready a character to give them the +1 will.  If it said "Ready them then give them +1 will" they would have to be exhausted for it to work.

## 5 [cmabr002 on January 17, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1995456)

The text in parentheses seems to indicate that you can choose the same target.

 

Also, shosuko is correct about the word "and".  It has been previously ruled that We Are Not Idle [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/We-Are-Not-Idle-SaF] can still be used even when your deck is empty.

Mmm.. ok, so if i can choose a ready character to ready him and give him +1 willpower, can i choose the same character with  this card?

Or... do we have the same effect here like Flame of Arnor?

To be honest I wasn't aware of the Flame of Anor ruling, and now I am aware of it I'm going to ignore it anyway.

> To be honest I wasn't aware of the Flame of Anor ruling, and now I am aware of it I'm going to ignore it anyway.

 

A couple things:

 

1) The Flame of Anor ruling doesn't really come into play unless you are trying to do a double or triple Flame of Anor on a single attack, since you can always play it after the Istari exhausts to attack but before the attack resolves.

 

2) The fact that ready characters can't ready is pretty important. If it were not the case, Silvan tracker would heal 1 damage on every silvan in play each turn regardless of their state.

 

3) Flame of Anor is worded "discard the top card of your deck to ready an Istari character". The phrase after the "to" must be able to happen in order for you to pay the cost for it. If you allow Flame of Anor to work on ready Istari, you end up with other strange situations, where Boromir with Elf-friend pays 3 threat to ready himself (despite already being ready) in the refresh phase to fully heal himself with the help of Silvan tracker. Or you could have Treebeard ally who has stacked up a pile of resources paying to ready a Wellinghall Preserver 4 times in a row to completely heal himself. Or you could play Tale of Tinuviel despite not having any Dunedain characters, just in order to trigger Love of Tales.

I'm quite comfortable with "ready a character" being an effect that can target a ready character and do nothing. I don't really know why.

If you can pay costs for non-existent effects it breaks a lot more things. 

 

If Haunted Valley [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Haunted-Valley-TSoE] enters the staging area, but I want to have access to my spirit resources during the combat phase, can I choose to just exhaust Fatty [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Fatty-Bolger-TBR] and name a non existent enemy?

If I have Steed of Imladris [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Steed-of-Imladris-AtE] on a hero, can I decide to discard my Lords of The Eldar [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Lords-of-the-Eldar-TBoCD] even if there is no active location?

If Fallen Stones [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Fallen-Stones-DDaCDN] is in the staging area and I want to travel there, but it would kill my Errand-Riders [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Errand-rider-HoN], can I just decide to exhaust all my Errand Riders even if I don't have any resources to move?

If Mithril Seeker [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Mithril-Seeker-FoSN] is going to attack me, can I spend all my money playing a few copies of Ancestral Knowledge [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Ancestral-Knowledge-KD], even though there is no active location, just so that the Goblin Seeker doesn't get to take any resources?

If there are no enemies in play, can I exhaust Haldir [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Haldir-of-Lorien-TiT] and name a non-existent enemy, so that he can get healed by Silvan Tracker [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Silvan-Tracker-TDM] in the refresh phase?

 

I am pretty sure the answer to all of these questions is "no". The developers did not intend for costs to be able to be paid this way.

So .. Back to my question ... what happens if i can't fullfill more than one of Elwing's Flight-effects but have a second copy in my discard pile?

That's not what I said. It's the particular case of "ready a character" that I am happy to be an effect that does nothing (distinct from an effect that can't resolve).

 

For instance, the effect on Lure of Moria clearly can resolve even if all dwarf characters are not exhausted.

 

My opinion doesn't make a lot of sense, but it's probably based on too much Magic.

Mmm.. seems legit. Lure of Moria is a neat example, but i think to play Lure of Moria there must at least one exhausted dwarf character.

I guess things like Lure of Moria with "all" characters are interpreted as not being a single effect but rather a collection of effects and so follow the We Are Not Idle rule of "you can resolve the ones you can resolve and ignore the ones you can't". This is why I'd imagine that Elwing's Flight can be used on the same character several times.

Beside this discussion .. a simple question: 

how many characters can i choose with Elwing's Flight if my three copies are in the discard pile and i use Map of Earnil to play it?

my first thought was 4 .. but i think it's 3 because you play one copy out of the discard pile right on the table, then check your discard pile .. 2 copies left.

## 17 [NathanH on January 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1999609)

Yeah, I would only resolve three of them.

## 18 [PocketWraith on January 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1999691)

I would say four. I don't actually recall a ruling, but I don't feel like an event is technically considered to go anywhere when you play it until it's discarded. You probably move it to the table for clarity and so other players can see what you're doing, but I don't think the game considers it to have left your hand until you finish resolving and discard it. So similarly with Map of Earnil it would technically still be in your discard pile while you're resolving the effect.

## 19 [NathanH on January 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1999714)

Events you're playing from your hand must surely not be in your hand while you're playing them (else you could discard Daeron's Runes to itself, for instance) so I would have thought that events being played from the discard pile have to go "somewhere else" while being played too. But I have never really understand the exact timings with moving events around, and we tend to be rather relaxed about it (for example, we leave Feint on the board until the end of the combat phase in most cases, and don't worry that this slightly gets our discard piles in the wrong order).

## 20 [JanB on January 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1999738)

@PocketWraith: NathanH gives a good example with Daeron's Runes. With your intepretation i can discard Daeron's Runes for its effect?

## 21 [Lecitadin on January 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1999838)

So... can you declare an attack with 2 heroes, even if one of that 2 heroes isn't needed for the attack? Example : you declare tactics Marry and tactics Aragorn to destroy an enemy with 1 defense and 2 hit points just to involve Merry in the attack to ready Aragorn again?

Yes.

I think the way Flames of Anos is rule is because it says you ready an istari character.. and give THAT characters the bonus.

 

This means that you have to successfully ready an istari character in order to then target them for the bonus.  If you don't ready an istari (you cannot ready a character that is already ready) then you cannot give the istari you readied a bonus.  It's not a single "ready and give bonus" but it's broken down into two parts.  1st part - ready a character.  Stop.  2nd part - the character you readied gets bonus attack.

 

Compared to Elwing's Flight where it is a single sentence "ready a questing character and give them +1 will."  So for this they only have to be questing.

Lure of Moria does still have an effect even if you have no Dwarf Characters. It resolves by readying 0 characters. It may seem odd, but they've ruled that "all" can be 0 before. But if the card said "Ready a Dwarf character" and you had no Dwarves, you couldn't play it, because "a" cannot be 0.

I would say 4 as well. This is a ruling from Caleb on whether you have to pay extra for recalling an event with a Record if Heavy Curse is in play:

Now, he does't go on to specify where the event card is when you are resolving its effects, but without some indication that it gets put into some sort of limbo mode, I would assume it's still in your discard.

But if I have one dwarf character that is ready and one dwarf character that is exhausted, can I resolve the effect "ready all dwarf characters"? It is physically impossible for me to ready all dwarf characters.

 

I mean, I know I may resolve the effect. But it's a bit funny.

When an effect uses "all", you resolve it as much as possible. When a treachery says to exhaust all characters, you don't get to ignore it just because 1 character is currently exhausted  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Well, yes. I know. But I don't like it very much. It feels unpleasant. "Ready all dwarf characters" feels like a single effect, so I don't like that it isn't. I would feel much more comfortable if it were a single effect that just didn't happen to do anything to ready dwarfs.

I don't know if the Heavy Curse/Record attachments ruling is relevant here.  The ruling for that says "It is still in your discard pile at the time you must pay its cost..."

 

It isn't entirely clear where cards go after you've paid their cost as previously mentioned in this thread (regardless of whether they are played from your hand or discard pile or somewhere else.

 

Here is the quote from the rule book regarding events:

 

> An event card is played from a player’s hand, its text effects are resolved, and the card is then placed in its owner’s discard pile.

 

1.  You pay the cost for the Elwing's Flight in your discard pile via the record attachment

2.  You resolve its effects (unfortunately we don't know how to exactly resolve Elwing's Flight in this example because of the ambiguity of where the event is)

3.  You place the event in the discard pile.

 

It does seem that event cards enter a an unidentified limbo state.  Otherwise, as was also mentioned, you would be able to discard Daeron's Runes when you triggered its effect which seems wrong to me.

So, Daerons Runes means it doesn't make sense for it to be in your hand when resolving it.

 

And the Hama/Quick Strike ruling means it isn't in your discard until it's done resolving.

 

So I guess a limbo state is necessary?

It seems so, but I don't think we can declare it with 100% certainty.  It seems odd that it isn't mentioned in the rules explicitly if it does indeed exist.  It's also just as possible that they forgot to include mentioning it as it may not have been relevant initially.

 

Theoretically, it could be "in play" but I think we have received rulings that events are not "in play".  Is it true that we have received such a ruling?  If we have, then are there any other options as to where the card could be other than an undesignated limbo area.

How exactly would you resolve Sneak Attack with Galadhrim Weaver if a limbo area exists?

Isn't Galadhrim Weaver a Response once she enters play? I'd assume Sneak Attack is done resolving and in the discard at that point.

Yes, Galadhrim Weaver is based on "enters play". 

 

I think so too, but if we accept that there is a limbo area, identifying when an event is considered to have "its text effects are resolved" is ambiguous.  It would be possible that Sneak Attack stays in limbo until the ally it sneak attacked is back in your hand.  I do not think that, even if there is a limbo area, it would stay in limbo that long, but I think it is certainly something that can be argued because the latter portion of its text effect could be viewed as "not fully resolved".

 

I personally think that in this example Sneak Attack initiates a passive effect and it would already be in your discard pile when you are eligible to trigger the response on Galadhrim Weaver. 

 

My main point, however, is that if we accept a limbo area, it could make other interactions more ambiguous.

No, I don't think that is the case. Otherwise if you play Sneak Attack off the top of your deck with Gandalf, he would have all resource icons until the end of the phase.

If you only have 3 questing characters but only 1 of them is exhausted, you could resolve Elwing’s Flight in a number of ways:

So ... with Calebs ruling, it is possible to play "We Are Not Idle" without a dwarf character and draw one card?

Yes X could be 0 !

 

Some player use this card just to draw one card for zero cost and so virtually decrease the deck size.

I have seen a lot of combo deck use this card in this way.
