So I'm looking to get another core set, but I want to make sure I get one from the latest print run so that I get all of the latest errata. My original plan was to buy directly from FFG through their web store, but shipping turned out to be 50% the cost of the core set itself, so that's out.

 

My next thought is to watch for the next print run to filter through my FLGS, but I don't know how to verify that I'm getting something from the latest run. Does anyone know if the print run is marked on the box somewhere, and how to know that it's the latest one?

I don't know, but allow me to indulge in some minor sleuthing.

 

Looking at my core set box, I can see "1957DEC13" printed by the UPC. Nothing else I can see on the box seems to have any variable significance. You may note "EAN 13", but that is just referencing an alternate UPC system. There is also "MEC01" listed, but that is simply FFG's catalog number for the core set.

 

I bought this box just over a year ago, and from what I can tell the cards I got out of it have been updated with all current errata, except for the most recent "remove from the game" aspect for Will of the West. I have no clue what 1957DEC13 might mean, or even if it's related to the print run. And every image of the UPC I can find online shows this code as well, so my guess is that it doesn't change between printings, whatever it means.

 

Long story short, my guess is that you cannot tell from the outside of the box. Which is sad, but understandable.
