Interesting.  Good defensive bones on Thranduil, and he enables all colors of Silvans (if not their events).  I find Galion amusing, an elf whose only real purpose is to be returned to hand.  Not sure how often you would trigger Elvenking, unless Galion is around.

Thalion should combo with Thurindir well, and finally it's possible for Caldara to return *five* spirit allies.  (Practical?  No).  Forest Road Traveler I don't like so well, since active location attachments are fleeting.

Nice to see another tactics attachment, though the effect is unreadable; still, traps that affect the next enemy to engage are a little more controllable than ones that affect the next in staging.

Sadly can't read anything but the title and the word "Response" on the spirit event.  Gruesome art.

## 3 [webslinger9 on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431004)

I think in a Silvan deck, it would work fine even without Galion. Most of the decks I’ve made bounce cheap Silvans out with events, and get replayed cheap with O Lórien. These tools just make Silvan decks better. I foresee a Thranduil, Celeborn, Galadriel deck that’s going to be powerful. You lose out on The Tree People and a few other cards, but I think it will still be a strong archetype for 29 threat.

Nenya would still give you access to The Tree People.  Not that a Song of Wisdom and A Burning Branch would look bad on Tharanduil...

For the split second I thot Thalion was Talion from the Shadow of Mordor.

## 6 [webslinger9 on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431037)

I was just thinking you could try to make a Strider deck with Celeborn and Thranduil. Since Thranduils action is a combat phase, you can pop in allies when you need them, staying at that five character restriction for the quest phase. Then return them with Elvenking after. It might require too many pieces, but something to think about. 

## 7 [GrandSpleen on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431063)

Finally, Thranduil! His ability is interesting. Does not synergize with Galadriel (not Silvan herself but still Queen in Lorien), who is present in the “standard” Silvan lineup because her ability functions so well in a Silvan deck.  Still, Thranduil might be the herald of some more combat-oriented Silvan allies, ones with abilities that would impact enemies who are engaged.

## 8 [monkeyrama on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431076)

Elvenking looks like it might be the attachment to bring the Silvan trait together. Those allies are best the turn they enter, during my decks in the past always struggled if I ran out of events to bounce allies. Being able to return the cheaper ones at will is going to be very useful. Plus a new readying attachment. Looks to be a good pack. 

Thalion plus Thurindir is going to be nice. 

## 9 [Authraw on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431082)

I'm trying to decide if we can play Silvans without Celeborn yet. I think the answer is still mostly no? I like that The Elvenking gives us a new way to bounce Silvans for benefit, though!

Loving this pack! Not a bad card in the bunch. Thalion seems like a fun card to theorycraft around, although I'm not sure it will generally be worth the effort. He looks familiar, too... Hmmm...

Can't wait to see how the Woodman trait develops.

## 10 [Wandalf the Gizzard on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431120)

Wow.  two card combo (one of which you'll mulligan for anyway) readies Thranduil once per round and contributes two willpower for the game .

He should be carrying a ranger pack full of mountain dew! But seriously, he's awesome. Four resources for two willpower and some decent combat stats?! Then you add his second ability and he goes bonkers (though probably not worth it in a Caldara deck).

## 11 [Wandalf the Gizzard on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431125)

And Thranduil is done by Magali V! That means she's not completely done with LotR (at least for this cycle).

## 12 [GrandSpleen on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431126)

I wouldn't use Elvenking to allow Thranduil to quest, unless I have good reason not to expect 2 enemies engaged with me.  But I would use it to let him defend twice.  

If you want it on someone who can quest, Celeborn is a better target.

Thranduil's statline is weird.  He doesn't deserve 1 willpower and 1 attack, that 1 attack is especially weird. What is he, a hobbit?  Clearly they were trying to keep his threat cost low, but it ends up making a weird statement about the character.

IMO they tried to make a hero with low threat that can make deck with Celeborn and Galadriel , with starting threat not too high. Also maybe the idea behind this is that Thranduil was not a King campaigning to other territories much (if I remember well he did that only against the Dwarves of Erebor) , so not an "attacking" hero. 

 

I really like Thranduil, Elvenking and the elf ally ... nice combo. Thranduil will defend twice most of the time I guess. 

 

## 14 [John Constantine on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431156)

Consider his 1 wp and 1 atk to be that "the labor is beneath him", as shown on the Elvenking card art, he just kicks back and enjoys others doing the heavy lifting.

## 15 [sappidus on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431159)

Caldara only works with printed Spirit icons, so Thalion is a nonbo with her.

## 16 [JanB on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431201)

In a Galadriel, Celeborn & Thranduil lineup ... put Elvenking on Celeborn.
Playing willpower heavy silvan allies in planning, get boosted by Celeborn, quest ready via Galadriel. 
In combat phase use Thranduil to play a tactics silvan to help for combat, boosted by Celeborn und send the willpower heavy silvan back to your hand to attack with Celeborn.

Very nice ..

## 17 [dalestephenson on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431252)

I'll agree that it's odd for Tharanduil to have low willpower and attack, but it certainly makes him a more efficient hero.

I think recycling Galadriel's Handmaiden every turn with Elvenking would be interesting.  Celeborn has the best stats for quest/combat readying, but Rossiel has the best when buffed.  It's a pity Argalad's ability is once per round.

It makes sense to me that he has zero willpower and attack. Thranduil didn’t ever take a major leadership role in the War of the Ring, other than the defense of his kingdom and the Attack on Dol Guldur. He mainly just minded his own business in the Woodland Realm.

## 19 [Onidsen on August 6, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431383)

Non-Hobbit heroes with only 1 or less attack: Eowyn, Arwen, Galadriel, Denethor, Bifur, Beregond, Eleanor, Nori, Grima, Balin, Caldara, Rossiel, Bombur (not counting Hirluin, Oin, or Elladan due to innate attack boosts - probably ought to discard TaEowyn for the same reason). And now Thranduil.

I mean, that's still some pretty good company. Even Celeborn only has 2. All things considered, I'm not disappointed in the stat distribution of Thranduil. Frankly, I actually think that it's a rather ingenious way to represent his xenophobia and isolationism - he doesn't quest, he doesn't attack, he just sits back and defends his realm. Much like Denethor, really. I think that Denethor's stat line and Thranduil's are similar for the same reasons, and I think they represent a decent abstraction of the two characters.

For me, I'm excited to try an Elves of Mirkwood deck. Right now, I'm thinking Thranduil, Spirit Legolas, and Argalad as heroes, and I'm rather intrigued by the prospect.

The quest has a side-quest that prevents allies from defending against the dragon, and the dragon attacks for 7 and is immune to player effects.  That's not a good combination.  If that's not one of the first three cleared....

## 21 [Wandalf the Gizzard on August 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431447)

If memory serves, it prevents allies from attacking it, unless you're talking about a card I didn't see. I'm talking about the one in the card fan at the top.

Well well well, Thranduil hero finally!

I was hoping for an ***-kicking hero, so I am a bit sad, but I have to say they did a good job with him, very thematic!

Only in the middle of the cycle and yet so many cards that activate an idle part of the cardpool!

And quite thematic cards, as well.

 

The only thing that worries me is that there may be a little bit of power creep.  But this is just a feeling for now.

You're right, I hastily misread that side quest.  Not being able to attack with allies is *much* easier to deal with than not being able to defend!

## 26 [webslinger9 on August 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431767)

So how are you all planning on getting around Dagnir’s 7 attack each round, starting on turn one? Chumping seems bad, and stacking attachments on a hero might be too slow. I guess you could get lucky with Beregond and two shields in your opening draw...

## 27 [GrandSpleen on August 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431798)

Honestly, probably I'll chump.  But Beorn hero could take 1 hit and survive.  As could Beregond, even without a shield, provided there is no shadow effect.

 

That buys you one round, presumably :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Oh man is this cycle awesome!

 

Thalion is incredible, finally making a side quest deck now!

 

The forest road traveler could be great in the upcoming Woodman hero deck as long as you can recycle rose attachments. 

 

Thranduil doesn't synergize with the celeborn galadriel combo but it is still awesome

 

Elvenking isn't really good for thranduil unless you want multiple defenses but I think I'd still like it if all it did was return an ally to hand

 

I cannot wait for the spoiled packs in this cycle

Right, it does not synergize, but i makes silvan allies like Greenwood Archer, Galadhon Archer and Marksman of Lorien and Rumil more efficient.

Also, notice how Thranduil's stats are the same as his son's Legolas, just defense switched for attack?

I'm very glad to be getting Orcrist as a non-quest-dependent player card (as we will presumably be getting Glamdring, Sting, etc).

## 33 [koriakin97 on August 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3431999)

Thranduil might work with Galadriel-Celeborn, mostly as reasource moving, becouse most lore/spirit allies are questers. But I really like idea of Celebrimbor, Galadriel, Argalad deck focused on questing and defending, and Thranduil TLegolas and Haldir deck with ranged allies focuses almost solely on attack, with elven mail for Thranduil giving him sentinel.

## 34 [dalestephenson on August 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3432039)

Dagnir doesn't start attacking on round one, does he?  He's only considered to be "engaged with each player" when there are three side quests in the victory display.

## 35 [koriakin97 on August 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3432048)

But she attacks Hrognag Hill. I guess you can let her burn it for turn or two, but it has limited health, so Beregond or another tank will help

## 36 [Ywingscum on August 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3432240)

When defending the town against the dragon.  Excess damage goes on the town.  The defender still does right?  Why would they say Thrandruil is a good defender for the town?  7 attack kills him.

## 37 [dalestephenson on August 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280503-fire-in-the-night/?do=findComment&comment=3432260)

Thranduil without attachments can't take the attack, but even mighty Beregond unassisted could be killed by a +1 shadow.  3/4 is a fine starting point for a hero defender, the best for any Silvan hero.

I agree, Orcrist looks pretty sick.

Grimbeorn+Captain of Gondor+Orcrist = You defend for 4 then attack back for essentially 8 and get your resource back.

I don’t think I can do guarded artifacts in my decks.  The extra encounter card early game is tough for me to deal with. And if it’s late game, I either can’t deal with extra encounter card, or I can.  If I can, then it’s a “win more” card to me.

Yeah I totally agree, that's how it struck me.  Early game is when you want that resource acceleration.

When you can deal with an extra encounter card you are doing fine. 

Sword of Numenor never gets played although you must exhaust it and the enemy needs 5 or more hit points. But this is unique and guarded so I feel they both have pluses and minuses.  I like the theme of these being guarded, this and arkenstone but orcist does not seem worth it to me.  Time And playing it will tell

At least the guard for player cards is added.  There's typically plenty of locations/enemies that aren't so bad when added instead of revealed.

Good point. A good way to negate a devastating when revealed effect. It can also be looked at as a form of scrying.

The guarded player cards could make Shadow of the Past [http://ringsdb.com/card/02125] useful again, and might even help the case for the Palantir [http://ringsdb.com/find?q=palantir&sort=name&view=list]. For off-sphere options, A Watchful Peace [http://ringsdb.com/card/05012] could be helpful (provided you don't burn the location as a shadow during combat) as well as the lore scrying events, especially Interrogation [http://ringsdb.com/card/12090]. With sufficient scrying, you could even have the unexpected benefit of discarding a nasty treachery off the top of the deck.

The guarded player cards are actually pretty good early game in solo. With some form of scrying, the extra card is survivable early even in multiplayer. They synergize nicely with Wait no Longer and Hidden Way

Elvenking solves the only meaningful problem with my Lothlorien deck (running out of ally pickup events). Not too fussed with Thranduil himself, Celeborn's the king for me.

Thalion means strong, steadfast or dauntless in Sindarin and is a title of Húrin [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Hurin-FA], father of Túrin Turambar [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Turin-Turambar-FA]. Of course he has lived in the First Age and is long since dead.

On his recent interview with the card talk podcast, Caleb said that he chose the name Thalion as a deliberate attempt to translate his name into Sindarin. (Caleb in Hebrew meaning something like steadfast)

No, you still have to pay for the ally. The ability means that you can use resources of any type to do so.

I think the most powerful part of it is that you get to do it as a combat action.

Ah, that seems far more balanced.

Would work great with Greenwood Archer - plop the archer, hero readies, archer shoots someone, then Elvenking him back - hero readies again.

 

And since its play from hand stuff like Rumil works too.

I'm a fan of the Sylvan deck anyway, but it looks like it's going to be obscenely good after this pack

Barring Dunedain antics, why would one ever want to put progress on the side quest: Rout the Goblins? It has an irritating when revealed effect, but it has no harmful lasting effects, nor a benefit for completing the quest. The only reason I could see is if you just are trying to avoid having your threat raise by questing with it when there are no other side quests. Am I missing something?

It's not an appealing quest to target. However, given the right board state, you could want to do it. 1) All other side quest in play are ones that you don't want to target because something bad will happen when they are the current quest. Or 2) You won't be able to clear it because there are lots of Goblins in play, which you're good with, because you are trying not to have 3 quests in the victory display yet.

But for its own virtue, there's really not a reason to clear it.

Any cleared side quest means you can deal 1 extra damage to the dragon. That's it really

And Dagnir gains one extra threat.
