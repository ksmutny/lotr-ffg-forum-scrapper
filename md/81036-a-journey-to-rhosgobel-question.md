Quest 2b, Forced: After a card effect heals Wilyador, remove that card from the game.

 Do i remove a character card from play after using his action to heal?

Yep. Anytime a card (be it event, character, attachment, whatever) heals willy, you discard it.

only in that stage you remove the card, if the effect is used before that stage the card is not discarded.

And not just discard-- remove from game.

Considering you can't heal him before that stage anyway there's not much use in wasting your cards.

Why not? Just get rid of Rhosgobel from the staging area (not like there is a lack of cards that can put progress tokens on locations) and heal away at your leisure in stage 1.

Indeed.

 

Thinking about Northern Tracker, Asfaloth, Snowbourn Socut, Ravenhill Scout (in a different way), The Riddermark's Finnest and Ride to Ruin;

Just like in real-estate, the key to this scenario is… location (control), location (control), location (control)….

 

Sorry.  Couldn't resist.   burla [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/burlon.gif]
