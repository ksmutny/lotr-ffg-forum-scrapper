I've got a couple new decks that I tried with a friend (Bork). One deck is mono-lore and focused on Ithilien Rangers while the other deck is all about Gondor, meaning it pumps out many allies, gathers lots of resources, and bumps attack and willpower of all Gondorians (including the Rangers).

 

Here's the Deck [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx-fOyjETSA]

Here's the game [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9piB6CNvn8]

 

I'd love to hear your suggestions for changes to the decks. After the game, I'm really thinking about throwing some spirit and threat reduction into the ranger deck (to ensure the other deck is the one that gets engaged and to obviously prevent threating out) and maybe limiting the doomed cards a bit more. But I can't decide which hero to change into a Spirit hero. Damrod is absolutely a must, especially if only two of the heroes are going to be Lore. Aragorn is awesome and can get Sword that was Broken... maybe just throw Celebrian's Stone in to give him spirit? Or like I mention in the video, just using some songs? Haldir is amazing if you can avoid engagement...

 

I think if you can get Visionary Leadership out for the other deck, Sword that was Broken is largely pointless... so maybe just replace him with a Spirit hero. But who? I was thinking Glorfindel (so I can also use Asfaloth and possibly the new Steed of Imladris because these decks may have issues with locations), but of course Glorfindel is used too much. The other options I like are Eleanor, Frodo, and Merry. I want a lower starting threat so Idraen is out of the picture. Dunhere is also a possibility but I think Haldir sorta has his job pegged.

 

As for the Gondor deck, it needs a better balance of ally costs, I think. It definitely needs more strong allies if we're going to be having the Faramir hero, otherwise I might as well use the ally version.

A nice new editions to LOTR LCG videos!

You could include Favor of the Valar to help prevent threating out.

 

Have the leadership deck include Celebrain's Stone for your Loragorn.  Then you could include Double Back. Assuming it's a few turns in, if you trigger Loragorn before completing this quest, you'll get your threat under your teammates. 

 

If you went with some Victory Display stuff, then you could enable Keen as Lances for both decks.  

 

If you keep the doom cards in, I'd suggest someone run the Keys of Orthanc.

Hey Sloth, certainly some interesting ideas in there. Maybe I'll investigate valour effects for the Gondor Shares deck and splash a little bit of spirit via Celebrian's Stone, primarily for A Test of Will, Desperate Alliance (to let the other play use Aragorn's threat reset), and maybe some Arwen, because we may need a bit more defense (hard to tell vs Passage Through Mirkwood).

We made some updates to the decks and decide to take on a more powerful quest. The results are devastating.
