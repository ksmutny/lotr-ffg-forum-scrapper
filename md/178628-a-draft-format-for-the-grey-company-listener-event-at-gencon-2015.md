Ahh cool. It seems you do need to have a large cardpool, but the idea is awesome!

I see one little problem here. Such draft format is oriented to be performed mutually, while in LotR only one side will get random unorganized cards - players, and most of the quest crush even precisely built player decks.

I love the idea of a draft for LotR, although I suspect a 4 player game constructed this way will have a hard time beating any but the most basic quests.  I'm glad you lowered the minimum deck size.  That seems pretty necessary considering you probably won't have 3x of any cards.

I agree that this format will not work for the more difficult scenarios. This is why we are going to play it against easier scenarios and we may even be using Easy Mode. This format was never intended for scenarios like Into Ithilien or Helm's Deep. This is all just theory right now, but I will report back after I run this at the local Austin LotR group next week.

fascinating idea. it kind of brings in a bit of competitivity by including the deckbuilding skill into the play experience, and thus allowing the showcasing of mastery, yet still retains the cooperative aspect too. pity im half a globe away.
