# [2nd play and seemingly unwinnable - what am I missing?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45529-2nd-play-and-seemingly-unwinnable-what-am-i-missing/)

Ok, so I was playing with the Spirit sphere of influence deck and the Passage through Mirkwood scenario.  The final task was revealed that I had to defeat the Ungoliant's spawn. My threat was only 29 so I was able to get 4 damage on him using Dunhere's ability to attack enemies in the staging area.  But once my threat was up to 32, the same as the enemy, after he engaged me, I am no longer able to defeat him since all of my heroes and units are only 2 power or less. I searched through the whole deck and there wasn't one card that would increase the power so it looks like I cannot win because the ungoliants spawn's defense was 2 shields.

Am I missing something?

 If you attack the same enemy with multiple characters then they combine their attack strength. Then the enemies defense in subtracted from that combined total. The applicable rules are on page 20 under Determine attack strength and Determine combat damage.

Ok, I thought I read that only a single character could attack any single monster, thanks.

Only one character can defend each enemy, you can attack an enemy with as many characters as you want. (Although cards like Stand Together will let you defend with multiple characters)

 When you defend with multiple characters, where does the damage go? ... Isn't defending the same as attacking?

Unless there's some kind of trample damage I'm not aware of... attack beyond your health is just wasted (fortunately?) on you right? So, I mean, after we survive that attack, all my guys that defended now counter attack right?

You can only defend against any one enemy with one character.

there's a tactic card that allows you to defend with more chars

the defense level is the sum.

I don't think so  - first you exhaust a character to defend against the attack. Then you have to exhaust a different character (or several if you like) to fight back against the enemy.
