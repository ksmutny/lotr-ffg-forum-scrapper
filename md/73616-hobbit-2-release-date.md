I just noticed that they updated the release estimate for the Second Hobbit expansion to Q1 2013 from Q4 2012. That's disappointing…

Fortunately, Heirs of Numenor is listed as being released in November!

Im so happy for HON coming soon!!! Really cannot wait. Hobbit is ok but is not so important in my opinion……

Yeh that is disappointing as i would like to finish the second hobbit adventure off before i started HON. Its not surprising though as they must be so busy with all the releases they have got on at the moment. Oh well at least it is something to look forward to after the big fat jolly man from the the North Pole arrives next month.

Seconded.
The second part of Hobbit will be fun and stuff, but it is more like a 'bonus' package, HoN is the real deal - specially if we get a Faramir Hero or a new Boromir (not that the old isn't good, I just like Boromir a lot)!

maybe they put it back because of all the other hobbit games that are coming out with the movie. it looks like there are loads of them. i dont really fancy any of them though. has anyone else thought about getting one?

the only one i've seen recently that really interests me is that new Lord of the Rings Dice Game

of course i will be getting HoN too. that goes without saying

I still don't put any store by the information on the upcoming page, no matter how often they update it! I had the deluxe for Call of Cthulhu in my hands weeks before it was announced as available, and I live in the UK!

 This happened with the Navis Primer as well (an rpg book) - but I suspect this was actually a publishing error in the country - since as far as I know the dark eldar book isn't out here yet and is meant to be.

 I was wondering if the last Hobbit scenario, on the Battle of the Five Armies, perhaps uses the Battle keyword.

In which case Heirs of Numenor needs to be out there as the Battle keyword gets introduced in that expansion.

if battle is in the pack, then it is likely it would get explained anyways, so probably doesnt make any difference
