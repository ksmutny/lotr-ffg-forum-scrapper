I need a little bit of clarification on this FAQ about Shadow cards:

"Q: What happens to Banks of the Anduin (CORE 113) if it is drawn as a Shadow card?

A: It will be discarded from play at the end of the combat phase, like other Shadow cards. When a card is drawn as a Shadow card, only its Shadow text is considered to be active."

Does this apply to Treachery cards that are revealed as Shadow cards?

Since they don't have shadow text their "when revealed" does not apply?

That is correct.  The only text on a shadow card that you resolve is the text below the shadow effect symbol as denoted in the rule book.  This means you do not resolve any "When Revealed" effects or keywords (such as Surge) during the resolution of a shadow card.

There are some treachery cards that have a shadow effects that read ''Resolve the When resolved effects above'' ans they usually suck (the when revealed effects is bad enough that it deserves to double as a shadow effect).
