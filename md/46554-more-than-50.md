Why would you have to make a 60 cards deck if you wanna use more than 50 cards (which is not a great idea by the way) ?

It's in the rulebook.  Deck construction.  50 is minimum.  You can have more, but this cuts down the chances of you getting what you want, so not advisable.

I haven't seen a maximum amount of cards for a deck. I personally dislike having more than 50, but I think 54-56 is still fairly doable with a deck that draws well. The last game I played, I had 2 cards left in my deck at the end, I had drawn everything else. But that was a 50 card deck. Definitely lots of lore card draws for a deck that is over the minimum.

There is no maximum, just as long as it is not so many you cannot shuffle it properly. I would never recommend going over the minimum as it makes it harder to get the cards you want/need.
