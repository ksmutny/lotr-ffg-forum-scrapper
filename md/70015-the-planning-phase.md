 Hi all,

This is probably a basic question.  Players can only play ally and attachment cards in the planning phase (excepting through card effects).  In this phase, the first player plays allies/attachments, then the next player, so on.

Let's say the second player, on their turn to play allies, plays something like an Erebor Hammersmith, and as a result of the response effect, the first player returns an attachment from his discard pile to his hand.  It is now too late for the first player to play that attachment on this round, correct?

This is how I have always played it… just want to make sure I'm doing things right!

Thanks,

GS

Yes, it will be too late.

Page 12 of the rule book states that "[t]he first player plays any and all ally and attachment cards he wishes to play first. The opportunity to play cards then proceeds clockwise around the table." [emphasis mine]

So, once the next player starts to play his cards, you as the previous player have essentially said, "I will not play any other allies/attachments this planning phase." If another player subsequently recurs one of your attachments via the Hammersmith, you'll have to wait until the next turn to play that card.
