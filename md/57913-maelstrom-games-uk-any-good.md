I've bought Khazad-dum from them too - previously I've ordered Kings of the Sea, Mask of the Archmaester and Here to Serve, and they arrived pretty quickly (Kings of the Sea was on backorder, but when they got their stock, it arrived within a couple of days), and very nicely packaged as well.

I'm still all about 13th floor though gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Â I've used them a few times- quick and fairly reasonably priced and if you do something stupid like ordering a second copy of Dead Marshes, instead of Return to Mirkwood, they'll even do an exchange

not that anyone would be that daft

ahem...
