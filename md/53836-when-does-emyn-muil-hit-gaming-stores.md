I'm trying to work out a meetup around the release of the next Adventure Pack so we can all play it for the first time together, and from what I understand gaming stores get the product earlier than online stores like Amazon.  Does anyone know when gaming stores should be getting them?

How long is a piece of string?

 Exactly Spirit...depends on the string. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 Amazon is saying it will be available on October 20. I don't know how accurate this is.

Not very. They didn't release Rhosgobel til October 20th but it was definitely available long before that.

I work in a LGS in the US. The product just became in stock from distributors today. So most stores depending on which distributors they are ordering from should have it by tomorrow or Friday.

 Yeah, it should be out by this weekend.  I don't remember where, but someone gave it a release date of the 28th (today).

Thanks Hastur.  I was hoping to have a meetup for the day the store gets it but I guess I found out too late.  The players are excited though and it looks like 5 copies won't be enough.
