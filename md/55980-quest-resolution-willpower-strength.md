Gurus,

I have a few questions regarding Quest resolution and the "Characters committed to a quest are considered committed to that quest through the end of the quest phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect."

1. Aragorn: "Response: After Aragorn commits to a quest, spend 1 resource from his resource pool to ready him." If I spend the resource and ready Aragorn do I still count his willpower strength? I assume yes due to the way I read the rule listed above. I also wondered if I can pay to ready him anytime during the Quest phase after committing him to quest or only immediately after committing him.

2. I have an ally committed to a quest and the encounter deck reveals a treachery like "Evil Storm, When Revealed: Deal 1 damage to each character controlled by each player with a threat of 35 or higher." If this kills that ally I assume that it is concidered "removed from the quest" and does not add its willpower strength?

1) Yes, being ready does not mean that Aragorn decommits from questing. Only an effect that specifically removes a character from a quest can do this. You also must pay to ready him right away, as his ability is a response, meaning that it has a specific trigger and must be activated immediately after the trigger occurs. 

2) Correct. Any character killed or otherwise removed from a quest does will no longer count his/her willpower towards the quest.

1. Yes. Readying Aragorn does not remove him from being committed to the quest. As for when to spend the resource, his ability is a response to committing to the quest so must be done at that time.

2. Right. Because the ally wont be in play during quest resolution.
