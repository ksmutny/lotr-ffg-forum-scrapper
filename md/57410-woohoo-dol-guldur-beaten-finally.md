 Finally!  3 player game!  We risked everything in the final round and quested all but one to beat the threat 16 vs 9 and had already taken the nazgul out in section 2, so we won!  Thanks to Booored and others who gave advice!!!

Congratulations!

 

I'm hoping my girlfriend and I will be able to beat it next week when I start Christmas break, because I tried it solo and wow...that was ugly.

 Solo it seems just about impossible.  As a duo, you should check out the other forum message I posted where I asked how to beat it.  Booored's comments were really helpful.  I could tell we had a lot more control with implementing some of his advice.

 I managed to beat it with my brother and my girlfriend. When we beat the last stage we realized we had forgotten the nazgul. Hah.

I know, we have had other games where we (or myself playing solo) would forget too!  Somehow you don't forget the prisoner, but the nazgul just hangs out waiting and no one really wants to see his 5 threat and everything else come into play!

Me and my girlfriend beat is a couple days ago on our second try (I've tried to solo it a few times before that with predictable results). We used decks that I constructed specifically for the quest, with a lower than normal number of allies and more events/attachments (since you can not play more than one ally/round). The deck I played was a mono sphere Tactics deck with Eagle theme (Legolas, Gimli and Bard) and she played a dual sphere Spirit/Leadership deck with Rohan theme (Eowyn, Dunhere, Aragorn). Worked very well and although it was challenging we felt we had control most of the time.

We have 2 core sets and one of every chapter pack in the first cycle.

 Cool gartock!  Two core sets probably helps.  We just have one and the aps only through emyn muil.  We just won for the first time today as a trio against emyn muil.  I had won solo, and we had won in pairs, but never as a trio.

Hi Zjb12 and company... with all the Dol Guldur love flying around on this thread, I wanted to stop by personally and invite you to enter my first 2 Player Tournament, featuring EfDG with some particular deck building parameters. You can find the thread here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582949], and the tournament will be running all month.

I hope you'll give it a shot! Your tales of success are inspiring! gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]
