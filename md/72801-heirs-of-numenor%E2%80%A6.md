How has it worked with these "on boat" and such announcements in the past? When do you expect HoN to hit stores in the states?

In the UK you need to wait at least another month from on the boat. (Occasionally for some rpg books it's been as long as 3 months).

Thanks. And the States (I forgot to capitalize)? Not that it is my case, still I enjoy seeing even someone else having the cards…

This info is provided on the "upcoming" page: "On The Boat: The product is traveling from the printer to our warehouse. The duration of this process varies depending on where the printer is located, be it in the US, China, or Germany, but generally takes four to six weeks."
