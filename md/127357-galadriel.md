Sorry if this has been covered before. I couldn't find much on it.

 

I got Celebrimbor's Secret yesterday, put a whole lot of elf goodyness and some ents into my lore/spirit deck and tried it this afternoon.

 

Galadriel is great, no doubt. I ran her with Elrond and spirit Glorfindel. I beat PtM with ease, though that's hardly an accomplishment for a seasoned player and I'll put the deck to the test with more difficult scenarios when I have the time. (Questing was so good and my threat so constant I never even had to engage the Beastmaster or Ufthak, but just quested over their heads.)

 

Galadriel cannot quest, attack or defend, but am I right in assuming she can be assigned damage from undefended attacks?

 

I'm thinking of pairing this deck with Celeborn/Elladan/Elrohir for maximum elven mayhem.

Nothing wrong with that... didn't read the card in a while, but don't remember anything that said she cannot.

Well, does her card says anything about damage from undefended attacks?

She's a beast. I played her with Lore Pippin and Idraen against CS and quickly got my threat below the 20 mark. Had my hand full of cards, used her threat lowering ability almost every turn. The encounter deck begged for mercy...

Here is my question about her:

When you play blood of Gondor you got 2 allies in setup Faramir and another in the furure traitor. So since rule say : all effect in setup say : until the end of the round ,means until the end of first round. So Faramir and other guy come into play in setup so since they enter lay in setup and according a logic they will not tap to questing during the first quest phase of the first round. Right?

I don't see why not, as long as you're the first player during the first round.

If the setup counts as a part of turn 1 - yes. However, I think it doesn't, but I'm not sure about it. The rulebook splits each round in seven phases, and the setup isn't mentioned anywhere a a part of these seven phases.

FAQ:

 

(1.19) Card Effects during Setup
“When Revealed” effects are resolved if the cards are
revealed during setup. A player can trigger responses
during setup, following the normal game rules. Players
cannot take Actions during setup.
“When Revealed” effects that last “until the end of the
phase” will last until the end of the first resource phase.
Effects that last “until the end of the round”, will last until the end of the first round.
 
However this only explicitly refers to When Revealed effects and does not directly cover Galadriel's passive effect.

I don't think Setup counts as part of the first round, based on this text from the core set manual:

 

"Players then begin the game starting with the first game round."  

 

This text is in the core set manual after explaining what to do during Setup, which includes following quest card instructions.

 

But--- even if characters enter play during Setup, can we still consider all heroes and allies as "entering play" during that first round? Maybe.  Worth asking the developers, I think.

## 10 [leptokurt on November 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127357-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=1343469)

I'm going to ask.

## 11 [Glaurung on November 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127357-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=1343641)

In FAQ clearly say: all effect what happen in setup with words until the end if the phase last until the end of the setup, until the end of round last until the end of the first round. So objective allies Faramir put into plai during setup and that mean they are come in to play and Galadriel passive ability start to work and according to rules that last until the end of the round. Logic?

Here is gup in the rule so please Caleb bless us! !

## 12 [GrandSpleen on November 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127357-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=1343651)

it's just nitpicky language

 

Objective allies are put into play during setup, which is before the first round technically starts.  Galadriel's effect may not trigger since Setup is not part of any "round."  

 

Then, can we consider them to have "entered play" during the first round of the game?
 

Well, we'll see what Caleb says!

Another Galadriel question.  Can you quest with wandering ents on the turn you play them?  They are already exhausted but don't exhaust to quest.

As I quoted above, the FAQ actually refers only to "When Revealed effects" not to "all effects".

> Another Galadriel question.  Can you quest with wandering ents on the turn you play them?  They are already exhausted but don't exhaust to quest.

No, you can't. It's like "everyone survives when they're shot with blanks, but of course when they're already dead they won't". To exhaust your character has to be ready. If he isn't, they cannot quest.

But does not hero Gandalf seeing top card of deck ability in affect during setup?

I guess the questions come down to are passive abilities active during setup?

I would say that passives definitely operate during set-up BUT there is no direct mandate from the rules/rulings to state that in general effects initiated in set-up last into the first round.

Like jjeagle said: There's no question that Galadriel's action triggers. The problem is - does it end after the setup, and both allies have to be exhausted during the quest phase, or not?

## 19 [GrandSpleen on January 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127357-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=1425156)

I never saw an official answer to this question so I asked myself.  Got a response back today:

 

"Effects triggered during Setup resolve as normal. When you trigger an effect during Setup that lasts “until the end of the round” it will last until the end of the first round. If you trigger an effect that lasts until “the end of the phase” during Setup, it will last until the end of the first resource phase. 

Galadriel’s ability does apply to objective-allies that enter play during Setup (as long as they are not immune to player card effects).
Cheers,
Caleb"

 

So, while Galadriel is in play, objective allies under your control will not exhaust to quest during the first round.  And "Setup" is technically considered part of the first "round" for the purpose of resolving card effects.
