Was thinking of making a new deck for the next story arc but wanted to make it kinda themed, so with that in mind does anyone have a list of all the Hero cards featuring characters Made up by fantasy flight?

We have the heroes from Middle Earth Quest (no Eometh yet):

Thalin

Eleanor

Beravor

Argalad (upcoming)

 

Other FFG created heroes are:

Mirlonde

Caldara

Idraen

Rossiel

Amarthiul

Lanwyn (upcoming)

 

Mostly women because Tolkien included so few in his writings.

The current list of FFG-created allies is, if I'm not mistaken:

 

Brok Ironfist

Henamarth Riversong

Emery

And we'll probably get a new one for each sphere this cycle, as seen with Azain Silverbeard and Eldahir.

Eowyn's story arc wouldn't make sense if he had given equal representation. The patriarchal societies are a feature, not a bug.

I don't think anyone's saying otherwise.

I really like FFG created Heroes, however it's quiet a challenge to use only them as they are not that powerful as original characters from Middle-earth. I would love to see more FFG created characters in future, as we missing some for certain factions. As mentioned already above we have:

 

Noldor: ----

Silvan: Mirlonde, Rossiel, Argalad

Gondor: Eleanor, Caldara

Rohan: ----

Hobbits: ----

Dunedain: Beravor, Idraen, Amarthiul

Dwarves: Thalin

Dale: Lanwyn

Beornings: ----

 

So hopefully we will see a Hobbit, Beorning, Rohan and Noldor FFG created heroes in future expansions . Would be nice to see also Silvan Spirit hero as there are none so far.
