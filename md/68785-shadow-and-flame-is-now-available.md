i doubt it, i live in the Uk and the store i get my packs from is one of the last places (going by record since HFG) to get them in, and thats usually in about 3 weeks at worst…..

though i guess places will get them later than that

I just played through a couple times. Pretty neat quest, with some innovative encounter cards. As nasty as Durin's Bane is, it can power up even more as its weapons come off the encounter deck. There are some rules issues that need to be resolved, but it's a fun scenario if you don't mind getting slaughtered every once in a while. Pretty hard to beat without a heavy dose of Tactics, though.

Played it twice today and gotta say it is a pretty fun quest.  Only one once and the other time got pretty slaughtered.  It's a nice change of pace to have an adventure that actually kills of heroes with fair regularity, and also does a pretty good job of displaying the immense power of a balrog. 

Now bring on the Hobbit saga expansion!!!!

Oh, I wish things got delivered so fast to the place where I live…
