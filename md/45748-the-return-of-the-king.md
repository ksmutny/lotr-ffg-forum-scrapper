 One of the 4 decks I have designed for multi-player is a Leadership/Spirit deck featuring Aragorn, Theodred, and Dunhere.

Whole point of the deck was to get Celebrian's stone on Aragorn really, but it had unexpected synergies.

 

In a recent game I managed to get the following attachments on Aragorn.  Celebrian's Stone. Steward of Gondor, The Favor of the Lady, & Unexpected Bravery.

 

So with Theodred basically giving him a free resource each round, this bad boy was weighing in with 5 willpower and was able to act in all 3 activities,  Questing, Defending, and Attacking!

Same thing hapened to me, except I was running a Theodred, Aragorn and Eowyn deck. Aragorn is a Beast with Theodred and Unexpected Bravery. xD

How does the Aragorn, Theodred, Eowyn deck work for you? I've been thinking of creating one. Along with Faramir, Celebrian's Stone and The Favor of the Lady, it should be a monstrous questing deck.
