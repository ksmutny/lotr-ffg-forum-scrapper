Yesterday I bought the last AP of The Lost Realm cycle:  The Dread Realm!

Here is the last HERO.

What do you think about? I really love the image!

Discard a card to add one resource to a Noldor or Aragorn?

I believe gandalfDK got it right.

Discard a card from your hand to add 1 resource to a Noldor Hero or Aragorn. Limit 1 per round.

And yes, that art. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes

Action: Discard a card from your hand to add 1 resource to a Noldor hero’s resource pool, or to Aragorn’s resource pool. (Limit once per round.)

Now that a name restriction I can get behind, as it covers the whole trait aside from the single name!

 

Mind showing us other player cards from the pact that were previously unspoiled? (with rough translations, if it's not of an issue)

Great universal to use hero card!

Stats and ability are super, specially for spirit.

Even better with the new noldor discard deck mechanic.

But will she beat her own ally version?

And dat art! Is Awren Jessica Alba?

It's nice that the Hero and Ally versions are so different. Arwen hero will work great with her brothers. And of course also in any deck using the discard tactics (Noldor, Caldara). I guess Arwen can add that resource to herself?

I do not know the precise wording, but if there is nothing stating specificly that she can't, she falls under the category of a Noldor hero.

A little sphere-bleedy, but other than that I like her a lot. I kinda feel for Theodred who's resource generation is just not up to par with heroes like Mablung or Arwen. She certainly works with the twins! I used Galadriel with the twins but found the inability to play Steward or quest for a reasonable amount in turn 1 quite deadly in solo play. Arwen would certainly speed things up and rely less on a good card draw.

 

She can give resources to herself too right? I like that she can also work well with Caldara, discarding high power allies for resources to play for Fortune or Fate. Obviously she works well with Erestor as well.

 

Even without any combo's she's a really solid her with 3 willpower and resource generation. Solid hero all-round!

 

 

(Is it just me or does it look like she just stepped out of the shower? Her hair looks kinda wet and she's wearing some kind of bathrobe thingy.)

Yes I can't see anything that states "...to another Hero...".

I also like the fact that she don't have to exhaust to give that resource, being able to trigger it during any actionwindow is nice. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Like Arwen, but sadly she has a very good ally version too...

Do the degsiners want to give alternatives to the "best" spirit cards (Arwen hero, Glorfindel ally)?

I really wish she had 1 defense and 8 threat so I could use her as a replacement for Glorfindel in secrecy decks with guaranteed access to Elrond's Council.  As it stands now, there is no way to get 20 starting threat with her and two non-Glorfindel heroes.

Great hero - this is exactly what the Noldor archetype needed. Love the art too. Three willpower is great too, and the 2 defense can perhaps be used with Light of Valinor.

True, but an Arwen / Spirit Merry / Lore Pippin starts at 21, and if you draw one of 3 Elrond's Councils (or 3 Greetings thanks to Arwen's resource) or 3 Handmaidens, or 3 Wandering Tooks (in multiplayer) you can start in secrecy.

I think yes-- Caleb has said that, when designing Nightmare packs, he watches video playthroughs of quests to see what strategies players are using, then designs cards to counter them.  In the same way, perhaps they like to force us into using different cards other than our staples.  But then again, if we have a hero for once-mentioned obscure characters like Dunhere, then Arwen was long overdue for a hero card herself.

I have the Spanish, which is enough for me. I'll roughly translate the cards we have not seen before. Emilius may correct me if I messed up.

Eothain, After a Rohan ally leaves play by a player card effect from a player card effect, ready Eothain.

 

Sword of Numenor, Attach to a Dunedain or Gondor hero. Restricted. Attached hero gains +1 attack. Response: after attached hero participates in an attack that destroys an enemy with 5 or more printed hit points, exhaust Sword of Numenor to add 1 resource to attached hero's pool.

Eothain : After a Rohan ally leaves play by a player card effect, ready Eothain.

 

Tale of Tinuviel, Action: exhaust a Noldor character to ready a Dunedain character, or viceversa. Until the end of the phase, add the exhausted character's willpower to the other character's willpower, attack and defence.

 

 

Tale of Tinuviel is just insane :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

https://translate.google.com/#en/it/and [https://translate.google.com/#en/it/and]

 

I confirm it is AND. For instance exhaust Cirdan to ready a dunedain character and give him +4 willpower +4 attack AND +4 defence until the end of the phase.  :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

Guessing:

 

Sword: After the attached hero has participated in an attack that destroyed an enemy with 5 or more hit points printed, exaust Sword of Numenor to add 1 resource to attached hero's resource pool

 

Elvish Light: Play only if it is your discard pile. Action: Return Elvish Light from your discard pile to your hand. Then, draw 1 card.

 

Wow so Elvish Light can turn Arwen's ability into an extra card every turn. Pretty cool.

I like many of these cards. Elvish Light is probably my favorite apart from Arwen herself, and I think Eothain will work great in the Leadership-Spirit iteration of the Rohan deck. The Tactics event could be pretty awesome, but it was clearly designed with multiplayer in mind. Tale of Tinuviel is not gamebreaking, but could be a miracle card in the right moment. Leadership attachment, as I said, is quite disappointing. A minor attack buff and conditional resource acceleration? Yeah, neither Gondor nor Dúnedain need this at all. I will probably just run 1 copy, if I run it at all.

Remember Sword Thain is the neutral. I can finally build a top tier mono blue Rohan deck:

Theoden, Galadriel, Eowyn

Put Sword Thain on Gamling.

Allies are cheap, Eowyn is a 5 quester discarding Elvish Light even turn. With Elvish Light and Galadriel card draw is not a problem. Gamling fetches back discarded allies then readies with UC or Eomund to use his 3 attack.

I'm starting to salivate.

Great Scott!

The spirit cards in this pack are nothing but crazy powerful.

 

Like Duke said: Elvish light is bonkers.

Extra card each turn? You got it. It will only cost you a resource.

But hang on, new Arwen here let's you discard a card to add a resource.

Wait what? Yes, that means a free card every turn.

As far as I can see at least.

(edit: ah seastan figured it out too I see)

 

And Tale of Tinuviel is simply silly so strong.

Tale of Tinuviel is great man. I can't see why the designers didn't put more limitations on this or better said, created this monster. Adding 4 of all to whatever Dunedain, like Halbarad or Coragorn so they can most likely make use of both or even Idraen is awesome. Idraen provides UC for Cirdain..

Oh wait, I should have saved my 'monstertalk' for Elvish light. They could have saved us even more trouble/cardspace by letting Arwen draw you a free card anyway. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Great card!

That Numenorian Sword is an Artifact for a reason. Too bad the one artifact we get is so bad, ain't it Gizlivadi

Eothain, yeah! Awesome art, wauwie! Would play in Rohan deck 10/10!

The Tactics event could be great in a Boromirdeck where is is Ppppoweredd Up, other then that Gandalf is a good one with Shadowfax for mp, but outside mp or a sentinel/ranged hero 4 cost is a lot to swallow. It's valour effect is great if you choose Gandalf guy!(he probably has Splorfindel and/or Elrond too ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png])

The cloak, yeah meh. 'Nerf' for Necromancer's Reach though haha. (Remember those days that was a mustcancel allmost)

The Ranger seems finally like something Dunedain was waiting for and is good at. Nice title and art also!

The healer is just great! Silvan tracker but then better, I would even say.

Arwen, offcourse, she's great and she deserves to be.

Yeah... I mean, the card in general is not bad, I could see it working pretty well in a deck that abuses Tactics Boromir so he can get stronger and bring more eagles and whatnot. But yeah, the Mono-Leadership or just Leadership heavy Gondor or Dúnedain deck will find very little use for this. As I've said countless times, the thing the deck lacks is card advantage, and certainly not attack or more resource acceleration. A shame, really, as I was expecting some big attachment that would really enable the Gondor and Dúnedain decks... Oh well, maybe for another time. 

 

Edit: A little correction, Gandalfdk, the sword is not an artifact, just an item and weapon.

I like the weapon.

 

When I play heavy Leadership (more often than not it's mostly Gondor or Dunedain), I'm happy for any attack boost. As it stands, the Dunedain Mark were pretty good in my opinion. This weapon is an equivalent, non-unique as the Mark, with a conditional effect that is always nice to have when it triggers anyway. If it does not, it's still superior to the Dunedain Mark, as it gives you access to the Weapon trait in and allows you to Foe-hammer with Amarthiúl. Good card IMO. Excellent card in the right deck.

The cloak does counter Cold From Angmar, the worst weather card in the cycle. It's admittedly scenario-specific but makes for a good sideboard card.

Wow, Elfish Light has 'broken' written all over it! I can't even process the rest of the pack due to the insanity of this one. Draw a card AND power a discard effect for 1 spirit resource? And it doesn't even cost a card itself to play? Mithrandir's advice with 2 lore heroes is technically +1 card for 1 resource and this one also powers an ability and is repeatable? Goodby Lore then!

As amazing as the new art is it has nothing on the art in the two existing copies of Arwen and pales in comparison in my opinion. 

Amazing player cards and interesting hero.

I get that her extra resource can help Elrohir or Elladan use their ability one more time in any given turn but I don't agree that "the brothers deck is now a thing". It is already a thing (has been for a long time.....) and she adds very very little to it to be honest. Steward does a far far better job and the whole downside of the brothers ability is that you are using up resources you could otherwise save and spend on player cards, that is the entire trade off...
If you are discarding a card on various turns to give them another resource you are essentially not only using up precious resources you need for player cards but you are also discarding your precious player cards themselves! In some sort of deck that uses all 1 and 0 cost cards, features recursion a la will of the west and weaver and focuses on attachments and events with very few allies/only cheap ones I could see this potentially working decently but otherwise it just seems really average. 

I think she works way better in an Erestor and/or Cirdan discard deck, like miles better.... like incomparably better.

I feel she does very little for her brothers in reality. She is in a different sphere to both of them so to run all three would require a tri sphere deck with 29 starting threat. Her ally version is AMAZING for Elrohir (sentinel and his ability go together PERFECTLY not to mention the +1 defense) and makes him into so much more of a powerhouse defender and for any player. 

Don't get me wrong I think she is a very well designed and neat hero with a great ability but in my opinion she does next to nothing for her brothers and is not as good as her ally version for a brothers deck.

I must say I don't quite get the hype around Elvish Light. Yes, the card is good, but everybody is screaming like it's new groundbreaking thing that will overthrow the Steward of Gondor or something. 1 card for 1 resource is not that good of a deal, and we had that deal before in a neutral card (hidden cache), in a leadership one (campfire tales) and even a better deal in the leadership (we are not idle). It is a discard chump that lets you use it later continuously, and I'm sure it will do it's job well, but will it break the game as most people here saying? I don't think so.

Hidden cache and we are not idle allowed you to draw a card, but you had to play a card in the first place, so you basically didn't get anything, whereas Elvish Light is played from discard pile, so you get one more card. Hidden cache if drawn only robbed you from one resource (or at least that's the way I played it). Campfire tales gets better with more players, but it's worse than useless in solo. I'm not saying Elvih Light breaks the game, but it's perfect for discard decks, as they often have too much resources

Endlessly repeated once per turn. Very good in the right hands, but not breaking. It allows Arwen to draw an extra card and add a resource per turn. Galadriel gets to draw a card and reduce threat.

It the tactics bowman that really breaks the game, because, you know, tactics.

> I used Galadriel with the twins but found the inability to play Steward or quest for a reasonable amount in turn 1 quite deadly in solo play. Arwen would certainly speed things up and rely less on a good card draw.

Use Eowyn instead of Galadriel and you'll be better off.   Arwen is an acceptable substitute here, but I'd still say Eowyn is likely better since you won't really have much card draw to fund Arwen's ability.  Though she does help first turn Steward, so that is something to consider.  She could definitely speed things up a bit.

> Yes, the card is good, but everybody is screaming like it's new groundbreaking thing that will overthrow the Steward of Gondor or something.

 

I don't think this card is broken in a 'Steward of Gondor now gives 3 resources' type of way. I think it's broken in a 'Steward of Gondor is now spirit' type of way. Lore is the carddraw sphere and let's compare it with Elvish Light.

 

Berevor: exhaust a hero to draw two cards turn

vs

Cirdan with EL: spend 1 resource to draw two cards each turn

 

Bilbo: draw a card each turn

vs

Arwen with EL: draw a card each turn with better stats

 

Lorien's wealth: draw 3 cards for 3 resources

Discard ability + EL: draw x cards for x resources + activate x discard abilities

 

etc.

 

So spirit can now do a lot of things only lore could do before (and better!) just because of one card. Maybe broken isn't the right word, but if this was a competitive game, a lot of players would now ditch lore in favor of spirit when it comes to splashing carddraw. There is also no limit to how many times you can use it (as long as you can discard cards through some means). It's also the Erebor Hammer Smith-Born Aloft-Legacy of Durin-Horn of Gondor combo in one card. Even if it's not broken now, people will find a way to break this sooner rather than later. For example, cards like Gaining Strength and Wealth of Gondor can now become 0 cost cards that replace themselves and add a small buff while doing so. I really wish this guy would go back into your deck instead of into your hand from where it can be discarded again. 

 

On a more personal note, I dislike it because of how it changes the Noldor mechanic from 'discard a card' to 'discard a card OR draw a card and pay 1 resource'. Where I was intrigued before about how to fuel the Noldor trait and get enough carddraw, now all I have to do is add Steward of Gondor and done. It's like spirit Glorfindel where you take an interesting concept and add a card that nullifies what makes it interesting (light of valinor). :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] So yeah, not a fan of this card to say the least. But, I'll let it sink in for a moment and see if I'll grow to like it.

 

 

Other cards look awesome though! Leadership sword that occasionally gives resources is great. I like having more weapons anyway. Another strong Dúnedain. Tactics event that's great in multiplayer and allows players to use heroes other than Boromir in a similar way for one turn. Only the hood is a bit quest specific which I'm not much a fan off. Also this pack really makes me want to try to build a Secrecy Aragorn Arwen deck.

Beravor doesn't needs to spend anything or have anything in hand to consistently draw 2 cards. Beravor can give those cards to other players in need.

 

Bilbo is a big pushover, but nonetheless - he doesn't need to have a particular card in his hand to function, he does so right off the bat.

 

Lorein's Wealth is one of the cards you can play as soon as you lay your hands on it, the combo you described requires having a lot more than that.

 

And, to top it all off, what's with the worth of Elven Light if you do not run Arwen/Cirdan? Most non-hero-printed draw effects do not require you to have a specific hero in the game to be effective. I think, the one thing you must understand is that this card seems to be powerful to you with a couple of certain heroes, and the game is much more than that.

Lore Keeper nailed it. I love to go mono blue, but card draw was always rough. Basically Ancient Mathom and Gandalf were all that was available. Then we got Galadriel and things improved slightly, but always it was better to go blue/green instead for card draw.

Now? Warden of Healing is the main reason to go green.

Oh, and if you go blue with a Hama deck, it turns out Elvish Light is good there too, since the main weakness of Hama is running out of cards.

It's pretty good.

> A little sphere-bleedy, but other than that I like her a lot. I kinda feel for Theodred who's resource generation is just not up to par with heroes like Mablung or Arwen. She certainly works with the twins! I used Galadriel with the twins but found the inability to play Steward or quest for a reasonable amount in turn 1 quite deadly in solo play. Arwen would certainly speed things up and rely less on a good card draw.

I run Sam with the twins and he is in sphere for first turn Steward on Elrohir (without having to discard a card), also has 3 willpower like Arwen and has one less starting threat...

 

Then again with Arwen you'd have that second leadership resource by discarding a card as well as her own spirit resource still remaining. Plus she has the Noldor trait so can benefit from stuff like Valour of the Eldar or whatever its called. I will probably play around with the idea of replacing Sam with Arwen and sussing out what other changes I would make to the deck based on this but ultimately I'm not sure if it'll stick. You'd need to have more resource smoothing for a tri sphere deck too... hmmm..

Here's something with Arwen which is obvious but had not clicked for me till just now.

So you just need a single copy of Elven Light at the start of the game.

Discard Elven Light with Arwen's ability to add a resource to another hero of a different sphere (has to be Noldor though)

Play Elven Light with Arwen's resource to put it back in your hand and draw a card.

Do this every following turn of the game and Arwen's resource essentially gets transferred into whatever sphere you want rather than you gaining an extra resource and you also get to draw a card every turn with Elvish Light....

This is pretty **** useful... You could even play her without including any spirit cards except for x3 Elvish Light and maybe some test of wills or whatever..
perhaps I was too quick to judge...

Before I started relying so much on Core Aragorn and Sword that was Broken, I used to run the twins with Glorfindel and I remember it working just fine. But then again that was during the ATS era, so I'm not sure how it would work against current quests. Still, having Arwen with cards like Elvish Light you pretty much guarantee a free resource and card draw, which should work pretty good with the twins. Same thing with cards like Ranger Provisions. And I'm not even mentioning Light of Valinor, Test of Wil, etc, cards that really strengthen any deck. I'm eagerly awaiting to run thsi deck!

Also you could run Lords of the Eldar..... which would pump all three heroes and any Noldor allies you have as well..

Plus heroes across the board in multiplayer...

It wouldn't be as hard to play with Arwen's resource boost either.....

That's soo true. She can splash into any deck with Noldor characters without needing to really regard her as a Spirit hero, but they she also gives access to some of the 1-cost spirit cards once in a while. Very nice!

While Bullroarer Took and John Constantine make some fair points, you cannot deny that Spirit can now emulate all the draw options Lore had in the Core set with only drawing a single card draw. Sure you can debate if it's better to spend an Hero action (Berevor) than a resource (Cirdan) etc. but I don't like that this discussion exists on this level in the first place. Sure, Lore Aragorn is the best Threat reduction in the game, but lore doesn't have an equivalent for EVERY threat reduction spirit has while spirit now has one for every Lore card, save Deep Knowledge. For me Elven Light is the most extreme sphere-bleeding card we've seen so far and cheapens the Noldor trait idea by allowing resource spending as an alternative to discarding. Do not like out of principle. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

That said, I'm still building a Cirdan, Arwen, Boromir deck when I can because it's card-draw, resource collection and combat (plus cancellation with the right starting hand) right off the bat. And 7 starting willpower and relyable defending and attacking! 

 

I'm still looking foreward to trying Noldor and new Caldara decks in the future. Caldara is probably my favorite hero and playing around the discard pile is interesting always. Between Dúnedain and Noldor, I feel like traits are getting more and more interesting.

Your forgetting, Lore drawing a bunch of cards really doesn't get you much.  It was Lore giving others card draw that was always important to me.   Spirit cannot do this.  I think it's fine that spirit is getting something other than the matham to draw cards. 

 

Then again, I'm forgetting I feel most of you play solo, so Lore getting you card draw is important.  I tend to play 2-3 player, so a lore deck that shares draw is where it shines for me.  To each their own.

Run x3 Lords of the Eldar as well. Discard them to place a resource on another hero (or Arwen herself). Then when you have 3 spirit resources saved (which isn't hard with Arwen's ability) you can buff all Noldor until the end of the turn!

You don't consider Erestor to enable the Noldor archetype?

 

And who says Dunedain haven't been enabled?

Yes, Erestor surely is an essential part of the Noldor pack. Arwen, plus Elvish Light, Silver Harp, etc really did take the Noldor to a whole new level IMO, and I'm not even considering Cirdan and all the goodies they're getting in The Grey Havens. While the Dúnedain are good, especially in multiplayer, I can't say that they're really viable in solo, at least to the extent that Ents, Silvan and even Hobbits are. The potential is there, but their playstyle just brings too many problems and they lack solutions to those problems, such as constant shadow effects and lack of card advantage. But hey, maybe they were not intended to be good in solo, and I'm just wishful thinking.

Yep I'm excited too and going to make one as soon as we get english pictures of Arwen and Elven Light. The possibilities and flexibility with her is insane. 

 

I have to say that I don't think Erestor enables the Noldor archetype at all.. He enables a discard archetype which is in a way a type of Noldor deck... A twins deck is technically a Noldor deck... An Elrond, Glorfindel, Galadriel deck is a Noldor deck.. there are a few different types of Noldor deck and the discard mechanic is definitely not the main or only type. Also most other Noldor heroes don't go so well with Erestor in my opinion. Arwen does but the Twins, Glorfindel, Galadriel and Elrond do not specifically mesh with him. Yes you can make a fantastic deck with him and any of these other two Noldor heroes but other than Arwen or Cirdan any of them can create a fantastic Noldor themed deck without him and without the discard ability as a whole. 

I personally am planning to run the twins and Arwen and then Elrond, Glorfindel and Haldir in the other deck. 5 of the 6 heroes are Noldor and I will be using Lords of the Eldar which unless I'm mistaken is the only card that boosts Noldor specifically. I would consider these Noldor Decks and they do not use Erestor at all and only utilize the discard mechanic minimally through Arwen, Elven Light and Lords of the Eldar. 

 

I think that Descendants of Kings and the two new dunedain allies (+1 attack or defense for each enemy engaged) definitely help a lot with Dunedain decks and are semi enablers but I think one or two more strong cards will really bring it to a new level. 

Eldahir is a pretty badass ally and his ability seems pretty **** powerful, shadow reveal is nice and helps you prepare for that attack and his boosted 4 defense and sentinel are fantastic. Yes it costs you a lore resource but late game in the right deck you could use this most turns.

I'm going to rant about Dunedain for a moment, because I just don't see the benefits yet.  Let me know what you think of this analysis.  

 

 

The trouble with the Dunedain is - what are you trying to accomplish by keeping enemies engaged with you?  What benefits do you get?

 

First, here are a few cards that let you engage enemies outside the normal window:

Dunedain Hunter, Son of Arnor and Westfold Outrider

 

Second, here are the cards you are enabling by keeping at least 1 enemy engaged with you:

HEROES

Amarthiul: 1 enemy = easy access to tactics sphere, 2+ enemies = 1 bonus resource

Halbarad: 1+ enemies = 2 free willpower in the quest

 

ALLIES

Guardians of Arnor: 1+ enemies = 1+ shields on a sentinel character

Sarn Ford Sentry: 1+ enemies = 1+ card draw

Warden of Annuminas: 1+ enemies = 1+ willpower

 

ATTACHMENTS

Heir of Valandil: 1+ enemies = 1+ cost reduction of next Dunedain character

Star Brooch: 1+ enemies = 1 willpower

 

EVENTS

Descendants of Kings: 1+ enemies = 1+ standing of Dunedain characters

 

 

So across all spheres, there are 8 total cards that work off of staying engaged with enemies (did I miss any?).  And the one thing none of these cards really address is having to block those enemies attacks every round instead of killing them off.

 

Plus, what do you really gain?   2 free will power, a tactics icon and perhaps an extra resource if you keep 2 enemies around.  Extra shields aren't worth a lot except that those Guardians are the ones having to keep blocking the guys you stay engaged with, so it at least helps them not get killed off each round.  Star Brooch is a joke but if your using Spirit you might as well toss one in for Halbarad so it is 3 free willpower towards the quest each turn.  Heir of Valandil is an issue for me since, outside of Northern Tracker and Guardian of Arnor, there aren't really any dunedain I bother playing.  I find most of the Dunedain - except those two - to not be worth playing, so Heir is not worth more than a 1x in this deck.   And then there is Descendants of Kings.   An event to stand guys.  Which is great, but in practices has mostly been used to keep defending the guys that I kept around to get the extra resource from Amarthiul or to help kill off the extra enemies I picked up this round.  And I've never seen Sarn For Sentry and Sneak Attack at the same time so I end up feeling I'm better off dropping him and playing Ally Gandalf - whom I can at least play without a Sneak Attack and likely get more cards, on average, than the Sentry can net me.

 

 

Don't get me wrong, I love the Dunedain trait and the concept of keeping things engaged.  It's just that without simply using Forest Snare to keep them engaged, it doesn't seem all that useful.   In any given turn, Prince Imrahil can give you the same effect as Halbarad.  Strength of Arms can be more effective than Descendants of Kings and Gandalf and Valiant Sacrifice offer more reliable draw than Sarn Ford Sentry/Sneak Attack.  The Guardians of Arnor could be replaced with Warden of Helm's Deep.  This basically gives you the same effects and characters without having to keep things engaged.  The only real benefit is the resource generation or cost reduction available, but I write those off as being necessary to play enough guys to keep blocking the enemies you keep around.

I'll be posted a Dunedain deck in the near future that does very well against nightmare quests. It uses Amarthiul/Damrod/Loragorn, and uses Damrod and attachment fetching cards to get up 3 Forest Snares very quick. With that setup all your Dunedain have crazy stats, Descendants of Kings often readies 5+ characters, and Heir of Valandil makes everyone free. It's a lot stronger than any Rohan deck I've made at least, and very fun to play.

There are one or two non-Dunedain cards that make the Dunedain trait better, but I wouldn't call that "most necessary cards".

Well, I noticed you used Damrod. I assumed it because he reduced the cost of traps. Somehow I doub't you use a lot of traps aside from Forest Snares, so I thought Grima will fit better there. Plus, he increases your threat, which increases the odds of enemies engaging you (and enabling Valour effects, if you have any).

I do also run ranger spikes, so the 6 extra draws over the course of the game definitely help. But he would work well, especially with Loragorn in the mix, but I admit I glossed over him and went straight to Damrod because I felt that people wanted to see something work that was also somewhat thematic.

It's just, Grima can help you get stuff out faster even outside the traps (like turn 1 Ranger of Cardolan, for example, or Steward of Gondor with only 1 leadship hero), and if you'll run Keys of Orthanc, it'll be a huge resource advantage.

Played my first game with the Arwen Hero. Used an italian proxy as I was desperate to try her out.

Tried out the same style of deck I was talking about before, but with Theodred instead of Damrod. It also works well and managed to beat Carn Dum on the first try (got a lucky run with very few Sorceries).

 

I think Dunedain can be very strong. They just aren't strong in the "place all cards with that have the word Dunedain into a pile and call it a deck" kind of way that other factions are. But that's not a bad thing, in my opinion.

It's a lot stronger than any Rohan deck I've made at least, and very fun to play.

 

 

Looking forward to you posting this deck... Sounds very fun to play!

> While the Dúnedain are good, especially in multiplayer, I can't say that they're really viable in solo, at least to the extent that Ents, Silvan and even Hobbits are.

Apart from Carn Dum, i have managed to beat solo all the other quests of this cycle so far with Dunedain deck, (all heroes and all allies except one copy of Hennamarth), it worked really well. If i had more than one core sets, thus 3 forest snares could be even better. The problem i believe they have is that they do not have a hero that gives them traps, like Damrod is, and they do not get that many weapon attachments, though Amarthuil can be of help here with his Tactics ability. Ok maybe they are not top, but they can be good enough for most of the quests.

I would be interested to glance Saestans deck

I still have to build a good deck for solo play. I am currently trying Amarthiul/Amarthiul/Aragorn against The Lost Realm scenarios, but so far it's far from being exciting. I do win, but I also loose very often. Amarthiul'sability to play Feint is a step forward, but so far I don't thinkt that being engaged with an enemy gives me more profit than trouble. Perhaps Dunedain would have worked better in the early cycles, where enemies were less threatening and shadow effects more tolerable.

I feel Noldor decks -- or the Erestor decks -- are also like that. One has to be very selective about which "discard" cards to put into a deck to make it work. You put too many and you have a hard time fueling the engines.

Nice deck Seastan and I'm going to try it out.  But as you said yourself in the video, it's a traps deck and the Dunedain are second to that.  I think the complaint that many have with the Dunedain tribe, (including me) is that they aren't self sufficient yet.  You've made a good deck that uses them, and so have others, but it's still not like silvans or dwarves.

No, my argument is those are the only two Dunedain of any real worth to me since I don't care for the others much, making it fewer targets for Heir to reduce.  Granted, the use of Forest Snare enables it and getting any of the dunedain out for cheap/free is huge.  I'm mainly annoyed that their best solution is Forest Snare - which means Lore.  The best Dunedain is the Tracker, which means Spirit, but the best hero is Leadership, and he grants a tactics icon.  It's all over the place.  Which, arguably, is good and bad.

 

After looking over Seastan's article/deck, my real complaint still stands that I'd like to see the Dunedain trait more self sufficient with what it is trying to achieve.

 

 

@Seastan - awesome article and deck list.  With Northern Trackers and Warden of Annuminas being dependent upon Celebrain's Stone, do you think Blood of Numenor could make the cut to help Amarthiul block any big attacks if necessary?  Or perhaps a Song to go on Amarthuil as well?

It certainly is a Dunedain deck through and through. You can't just have Heir of Valandil working in a deck as an afterthought.

 

The thought process behind the design was: Dunedain -> I need lots of enemies engaged -> I need Forest Snares. It was not: I have lots of Forest Snares -> Lets throw in a couple Dunedain to make use of them.

Hmmm, I honestly didn't foresee a lot of complaints about using traps in a Dunedain deck. It feels very thematic to me. If Forest Snare had come out after the Dunedain mechanic came out, would you have not seen it as an enabler for the archetype? Why are they not considered self-sufficient if they use this card?

 

I could make a different style of Dunedain deck without it, but what's my motivation? So people can cry foul at a different card?

I understand your point and agree it is a Dunedain deck.   I guess if Damrod had been a Dunedain, then it wouldn't be an issue at all because then it would be a fully "thematic" deck supported by the single trait.  But it's also a point of contention that Forest Snare is really the only reliable way of getting the Dunedain effects to work, which forces you into using Lore at least some.

Even though I understand most of the complaints (hell, I made many of them), I'm totally behind Seastan's point. As much as I would love pure Leadership-Tactics Dunedain to be viable in solo, I have no problem thematically with using Lore and Snare. In fact, my main problem themewise is that the deck doesn't use Halbarad, who's my favorite of the Dunedain. And while Damrod is not far fetched thematically, I wish he wasn't essential.

Amarthiul - Halbarad - Idraen is a workable all-Dunedain lineup that can solo a good number of standard quests.

 

It's the easy way out, but there is actually a thematic connection for Glorfindel to be in Dunedain deck.  Amarthiul - Glorfindel - Halbarad seems like it should be quite good, covering almost every base a solo deck needs.

 

Dunedain are definitely behind some of the other nation themes, but they are in a much better spot than I thought they would be, considering the way they work.

@Seastan - what about the side quest Gather Information?   I think that would be extremely helpful to go fishing for whatever piece you were currently missing in the puzzle.

 

With that in mind, and the idea of hunting attachments with Galadriel, what about a full on Leadership deck with LeadAgorn, Amarthiul and Halbarad.  Between Descendant of Kings and Strength of Arms, blocking shouldn't be an issue.  Digging for attachments with Galadriel through Sneak Attack you can still include Forest Snare.   Use the side quest Gather Information to either get a Forest Snare or the Song of Wisdom to play it.   If we count on Celebrain's Stone for the spirit sphere, we could even use Ring of Barahir to build Aragorn up and give him Lore as well.

> So... when Dunedain existed in Middle-earth, there were no traps? What? In always makes sense to have traps, I'm sure even elves had them.

 

I think it's more that Forest Snare has always been "too expensive" and it wasn't like we ever wanted to keep enemies around anyways.  Damrod - a non-Dunedain - is what brought FS and traps in general back to the front of everyone's radar.  So by association, it's not thematic.   I'm fine with the rangers - or anyone for that matter - having traps.  Thematicly, it's fine.   But it just feels to successfully do what the Dunedain want to do, you need to run FS.  And if your running Forest Snare, why wouldn't you run Damrod.   Seems to be the way of thinking.    perhaps it's a narrow way of thinking - and my above deck idea does try to get around that - but that's basically been my viewpoint.

Yes, good thinking! There are many options. I never considered the route of trying to get enough defenders through Strength of Arms, but if you get your Guardians of Arnor out quick this could work well. The main issue is a lack of card draw.

 

It's funny, I too have been trying to work in the never-played Ring of Barahir. It would just be a long process of getting the Stone then the Ring before you can even get the Masters of the Forge to help you find the stuff.

Well Seastan, your decks do kinda tend to be the end-all of most archetypes...

With that said, I will try different variations of the deck. How about just running 1 Lore hero, Aragorn? Other would be Halbarad and Amarthiul. How does that sound?

At that point I wouldn't even try to utilize the Masters.  Gandalf, Galadriel, Ford Sentry and Gathering Information are the available "card draw".

 

That card will finally see play when we get a spirit Aragorn.   That has to happen right?

You could try that, I would just shift the strategy a bit to focus on getting Steward on Aragorn asap to restore the sphere balance. It could work very well actually. You could swap out the Gondorian Shields for Dunedain Warnings as well to make Amarthiul a stonger defender, as the shield isn't as good on him without Steward.

I keep wanting to build a Lore-Leadership-Spirit deck that uses Aragorn + Celebrian's Stone + Ring of Barahir as resource smoothing. I just haven't gotten around to it yet. Arwen would make a good Spirit hero, but I'm not sure who the third would be. Beravor for card draw maybe? It's still a work in progress.

You could try using Lord of Morthond for card draw in your mono-Leadership Dunedain deck. I'd love to see that card work outside of Hirluin.

He's not. Put Steward on a Lore hero and Forest Snares become very affordable.

I would disagree - Damrod brought traps in general back onto the radar, but the Dunedain archetype is what brought Forest Snare specifically back onto the radar because it's such a perfect fit.

> Quick question Seastan: how do you deal with this deck against quests with objective Amarthiul?

 

Hmm... I guess swap him for Halbarad, and switch the 6 or so tactics cards for something else? An extra Tighten our Belts, Descendant of Kings, maybe a Legacy of Numenor.

 

But I think the deck is strong enough that you could in theory just make a house rule and remove the objective ally from the game and use the hero version. Wastes of Erirador might be a little too hard for this though, I'm not sure.

It's interesting...

you need the truchsess first, then lord of morthond -> Dunedain hunter let you draw a card.

 

to play sprit and lore cards you need Celebrian's Stone and Ring of Barahir attached to Aragorn .. now you can play Master of the forge to dig for your snares. A long way... Galadriel should help with this.

 

For thread reduction aka Lore Aragorn i would take sneakattack with Gandalf. 

 

Perhaps you can delete some Master of force from the decklist  because of the setup to play them.

The Masters are perfect for Seastan's original list since it uses two Lore heroes anyways.  I wouldn't bother including them in the mono-leadership deck though, for certain.  The only Lore cards I'd run would be Forest Snare and Ford Sentry.  Just hold on to the sentry until you get a Sneak Attack or already have a lot of enemies engaged.  I'd run 3x of Clebrains Stone, 1x Song of Spirit Icon and 2x Ring of Barahir and 1x Song of Lore Icon (no, i don't remember the real names).

 

Actually, as much as I want to use all Dunedain, maybe drop Halbarad for a Dwarf hero - Balin is a perfect choice - and just use Narvi's Belt and put Steward of Gondor on him.   Granted, it gets away from the theme some, but makes the deck a lot better.

My two cents about the Dúnedain now that the entire cycle is out: they are BY FAR my favorite trait FFG has introduced. 

 

I love how they are based on a real risk-reward style. I've seen several different versions of them in the strategy section all based on different playstyles (sneaky with hobbits, clever with lore-traps and leadership/tactics all-out-combat). They offer a clear dilemma that you have to solve and allow different solutions. They also don't punish you if you want to combine them with other people, therefore allowing more variation in deckbuilding and less reliance on sticking to their trait only.

 

My favorite traits now include: Dúnedain, Rohan and Gondor. My least favorite traits include: Dwarfs, Outlands and Silvan.

A week passes but I found time to read the article. I like the deck very much, much more than the Dunedain deck I use -which apart from the 5th AP (and the 6th that I do not own yet) has won all the other cycle quests for me. I cannot really understand why using traps is not on terms with Dunedains, I use a lot of them. Seastan with the three snares takes 100% from the Dunedains. Well done!

 

To be honest, I have made a deck a bit like Saestans, major difference is that I used Beravor instead of Damrod - I think that I had a couple of Burning Brands instead of something else and prefered the Dunedain warning for defence to swap it on heroes, i like to have a couple of them on Beravor with Burning Brand.  But Saestans deck could win the last two AP's I am sure ... I start the think I must buy a second core set after all ... On my deck I only had one copy of Celebrians Stone and it was not always easy to get it, thus some of my cards where lost eventually

 

 

Seastan, have you thought of a way to use Tactics Aragorn?

Thanks for the feedback Nickpes, glad you like the deck!

 

Your Beravor idea with Burning brand sounds similar to another Dunedain deck I have, which I will also be posting soon.

 

Tactics Aragorn is a great hero, though he shines in multiplayer I think. I don't have any nightmare-level solo decks with him yet.

Arwen, Galadriel and Beravor is the first deck I'm going to make with these new cards.  Unexpected Courage + Nenya on Galadriel gets +4 WP for Beravor during questing.  Use Wingfoot on Beravor to have her ready when an enemy comes out.  Defend with her, then use Tale of Tinuviel on Galadriel to ready Beravor and give her +4 all stats.  Defend for 6, attack for 6.  Galadhrim Minstrel to dig for events.  Master of the forge to dig for attachments.  Mirror of Galadriel + Silver Harp to dig for anything.   Will of the West to recoup all the expended events and attachments mid-to-late game. And of course Elven Light for even more repeatable card draw when resources provide.  Quick Ears and Will of the West to deal with terrible cards.

When I run them I tend to run all the resource accelerators, which cause conflict since I often play in a group.  But for solo, that is 100% the deck I'd make currently.

Using her with a couple of warnings, burning brand and self preservation makes defence against Thraurdir easy. If you manage to get Wingfoot and Hennamarth(yeah, i will be getting a second core set next week! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ) or rumors from the earth, then you can also use her for questing or for her ability.

double leadership so you can play steward first turn on Elrohir is pretty **** handy I have to say.

Arwen can actually provide that role as well being more or less whatever sphere you want her to be by using her ability on her brothers, father or Glorfindel (or galadriel for that matter).

Matthew Newman's take on a Elrohir/Elladan/Arwen deck is featured in the new article:

https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/12/17/the-fate-of-the-north/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2015/12/17/the-fate-of-the-north/]

Sorry if you read this Matt!! I vastly prefer my deck and think its a fair bit stronger.... in multiplayer that is!
 

His is definitely very cool and more thematic and obviously functions far far better as a solo deck whereas mine is specifically built to partner another Noldor deck (hence no light of valinor for arwen or many other spirit cards etc as those are in the other deck for Glorfy and Arwen's resources are transferred to her brothers or father instead and her spirit resources are only ever spent on Elvish Light or Lords of the Eldar) so I guess it is very hard to compare them really...

Also silver harp.....? that directly messes with discarding and playing elven light AND lords of Eldar.... I guess it is quite good with Elven Jeweller and Steed of Imladris though...

 

I think he and I just have very different uses for Arwen, I use her mainly to buff her brothers and transform her resource into tactics or leadership every turn (whether during planning or during combat) allowing much higher cost tactics AND leadership cards to be included in the deck and allows for first turn elven mail or steward of gondor.

He is embracing the Noldor discard mechanic a bit more which is definitely very cool but I feel like that mechanic works so much better with Erestor/Cirdan and that Arwen is more useful (to me at least) as purely a resource smoother and a way to make both brothers far stronger but not really herself.

I don't know.. the more I look at his deck the more I like it and see the subtleties but as someone who never plays solo (two handed/two player is unarguably the sweet spot for the game) it just doesn't appeal to me overall. I much prefer a brothers deck as a support deck alongside another deck that can quest a little better as the brothers are just so **** good at defending and attacking. I have to say I really do like that he utilizes the 2 willpower the twins both have.... I am only able to utilize that on turns I play Naith Guide or from Lembas or I guess if I use my copy of unexpected courage on one of them...

Well, that's somewhat to be expected since it's built to theme rather than power - also Matt said in the CotR Discord channel that he doesn't like putting top tier decks in articles because he prefers the players to figure them out for themselves.

The Sword that was Broken is extremely strong, therefore it is "broken". Hence Sword that is Broken

Did better second time, but lost it as well.  Too many undefended attacks.  Hama likes to recycle Straight Shot and Goblin-cleaver in this quest.  

 

I changed my decks back to the ones I had been using for my campaign, so we'll see how that goes later today.

Now 1/3. I miss played my first game and might have won it if I had paid more attention. Not sure. Treat the end game very carefully.

It's an unforgiving quest. If you stumble, you fall.

Won on the 4th attempt.  It was my second play with Faramir/Sam/Mablung and Damrod/Haldir/Galadriel.  Spent a very long time on stage 1 building up, then it still took a few turns to get rid of all the Sorcery cards once I was fighting Daechnar.  Power of Orthanc can discard the treachery Conditions that get attached to your characters and to the quest, but it can't discard that enemy that attaches to you (it doesn't become a "Condition") so I had to damage him repeatedly and didn't have the direct damage cards to speed up the process.

 

Stage 3 went by in a breeze, at that point I could quest for around 30 and easily cleared out the Altar and all locations in the staging area in one go.

 

I like this quest, it has a good flavor.

Personally I liked every quest in the extended cycle. (All 9). I know the Carn Dum was controversial, but I'm fine with a quest like this once in a while.

Noldor development was top notch. In my opinion the Dunedain development was less so, but maybe in the next cycle we'll get more.

> Noldor development was top notch. In my opinion the Dunedain development was less so, but maybe in the next cycle we'll get more.

 

I agree. But it is interesting that Noldor should have developed in cycle preceding their own -- well that is if GH and DC are their cycle (logistically it is). I had longed for more Noldor love since the beginning, and I am so glad to have got it. Even if GH brings just a few Noldor cards (as it surely will), their decks will have gotten stronger.

> With that said, I will try different variations of the deck. How about just running 1 Lore hero, Aragorn? Other would be Halbarad and Amarthiul. How does that sound?

 

My non-trap Dunedain deck is up now here [https://youtu.be/LVJSv8TUVxo], and uses all Dunedain heroes (Idraen, Aragorn, Amarthiul). It has a weaker early game but a stronger late game I think. It also does better in quests with trap-immune enemies.

I finally beat Rhudaur as well. When I got it, I had some fairly unlucky draws I think. Luckily for me, I didn't put Steward of Gondor in my deck, so I can 'break glass and include steward in case of emergencies'.

I'm wondering what type of Dúnedain deck I should build with all the cards. Seastan already perfected the Damrod-trap deck I used and I've seen some excelent alternatives as well.

Boromir ally is a lot of fun in this quest, especially with some healing support. He helped me defend 3 Reanimated dead and helped me kill one of them in just one turn.

I do not know if it is because I tried Carn Dum so many games, but it did not trouble me except first few turns when Amarthuil got two damage from reanimated enemies and I had not yet Burning Brand on Loragorn. As soon as my allies started to come up and had two enemies snared (my only trap) then it went like a "holiday". Arwens ability with Elven light is great, and Tale of Tinuviel can save your game at some points. Loved Fornost Bowman also, at the last few turns I had two of them and each one was attacking with 5 or 6 (I kept having my reanimated cards engaged and defended with me three Guardians of Arnor)

 

It took 13 turns cause I kept drawing sorceries on stage two so I could not damage Daechanar, eventually at some point a location appeared (and I reanimated a card instead of drawing another) so with Gondorian Fire on Super Hero Aragorn he was dead meat. On stage three I quested with 25 or something and it was easy, although there where two locations in staging area

 

Nice quest, I will play it again, but camparing it with Carn Dum it is not a 7 difficulty as it writes. It is also sad that Iarion died, but life goes on and Amarthuil stands as his successor  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Second attempt, it was not so easy as my first above, i dumped the game cause i thought i would loose a hero, but while i was getting my cards i found out i was wrong (i had yet one copy of Guardian of Arnor instead of getting an undefended attack), but yet stopped it cause i had most of the cards picked up by that time

I believe i was very unlucky since on turn 8 i had already drawn ALL four Death and calamity treachuries (thus lost 10'cards as reanimated dead !!! including all my test of will cards), one A fell dead and twice the location that when you explore you reanimate a card from hand. Yet i was doing pretty well and if i did not wronlgy think i lost, there were possibilities cause i had most of my allies played.

Anyway, It just confirmed that I like this quest very much. It is very challenging but you have more options to win than Carn Dum

What a fun quest! I was playing 2 player with Jban yesterday, him with his Tactigorn-Merry-Fast Hitch deck that attacks a million times a turn and me with my Reinforcements-Very Good Tale deck. It came down to a crucial turn where we had Daechannar and 5 reanimated dead engaged with Jban, and 5 Sorceries still in play. Using Reinforcements I parachuted in Boromir to help Jban defend his enemies, then he attacked back with Aragorn pulling in all the reanimated dead and killing them off. Then, the MVP of the match, Mighty Prowess, pinged Daechannar each time a reanimated dead was killed and removed all the Sorcery cards from play. Then another Reinforcements from me dropped in a Beorn and a Gwahir under Jban's control to finally kill off Daechannar. Whew!

@Seastan - have you posted that Reinforcements deck?  I'd very much like to take a look at it.

Just like in the movie eh?

 

I had the same experience as Nickpes in I played this back to back after winning Carn Dum for the second time. I DESTROYED the quest, after 1b didn't give much enemies that couldn't be trapped and when I got to 2b I had a had full of Sneaky Gandalfs. I rechecked the rules a lot to see if it was that easy. The next few games where more difficult though, like when Gandalf got removed from my deck, I couldn't keep up with the extra encounter cards while Daechanar kept attacking for a lot. It's one of the harder quests of the cycle, but after Carn Dum it's difficult to see that. It's also quite a unique quest in that it starts easy and WITHOUT forcing you to hurry up, while still being difficult later on if you took too long. Only downside is that luck has a big role here in solo where nasty combo's can appear or not.

Agreed. The Cursed Dead are a cool concept, but there is a huge swing in difficulty as a solo player if you get that 4th one as a shadow card vs a reveal.

Do you mean fifth? There are five. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

When I did Dread Realm I just dropped my threat with a couple of Gandalfs and left four Cursed Dead sitting in the staging area. Much easier than just killing them over and over.

## 216 [Nickpes on January 8, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1978678)

I tried the game another 4 attempts. Won two and lost two.

 

I noticed that there where  two ways I lost. Either early, before I manage to deploy my cards because too many enemies appeared (either from encounter deck or reannimated), or on my second loss I threated out (despite having Loragorn) cause - as happened in most of my games - after 10 - 12 turns I have no deck left (most if the cards get reannimated or descarded by effects) so on stage two I always reveal two encounter cards thus never got rid of Sorceries

 

On the two games I won the no deck thus two encounter cards thing appeared but I had the test of will cards on me or a burning brand on aragorn etc thus the effects did not hit that hard.

 

Really like this quest

So, has anyone tried breaking the game yet with Hour of Wrath + Legolas + Sword of Gondolin? I was thinking that in multiplayer, especially if multiple players are packing Sword of Gondolin, this combo can instantly win you the game pretty easily. You can pack up Legolas + Aragorn (T) and whoever with those swords, let a few enemies engage everyone, then kill each one of them for 4+ progress each. So if the remaining quest points are less than 4 * number of enemies you instantly win. Theoretically you can get 6 swords of gondolin on your Wrath team for a whopping 8 progress for each enemy. Maybe add Gimli and a couple of Well equiped, Bofur to search for weapons, Book of Eldacar to get Wrath if discarded. Defender of Rammas, Derndingles and Longbeard Sentries for defense. Foe hammers for card draw and you can more or less completely ignore questing as long as you engage all enemies.

 

I haven't tried this yet, do you think it can work? And how reliable will it be?

I think the maximum effect there is a bit overkill for any quest, and this does require a LOT of pieces to be in play to be super effective, but I do feel playing Hour of Wrath will be no less game changing than a well timed Path of Need getting played.

What i did is playing the dread realm 2 handed. With tale of Tanuviel,Hour of wrath and one dunedain Cache i defended 9 attacks with loreagorn when Daechanar showed up and afterwards killed all enemies besides Daechanar(due to sorcerys;).

With this Combo Hour of wrath is quite the combat breaker and netting 4 tactics resources is not that difficult

Sadly path of Need Needs to be attached to a Location. This Limits its use, as does the Limitation of once per deck. Also you have to trick around with west road traveller and the like for it to stay in game.

Just being an Event makes Hour of wrath that much better.

## 221 [Slothgodfather on January 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194603-the-dread-realm-available-in-europe-revealed-the-last-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1993128)

Path of Need effects every hero though, and for questing - not just combat.  It doesn't have to go on the active location, so just put it on the location you are going to go to next.  The turn you travel there, your heroes don't exhaust for combat and the following turn they don't exhaust for questing.  Even without tricks to try to keep it around it is still often a game changer any time I've used it.  HoW is similar in that vein, but because it is an event you are correct that it is easier to use more than once - which is why it only effects one player's heroes, unlike Path of Need.

 

To be clear though, I'm not disagreeing that HoW is more versatile than PoN.  Just that they are very similar in outcome.  I just feel it is unlikely where you'd need to repeat the effect.  One turn of it's use will swing the game strongly enough in your favor that you shouldn't need a repeat use.

The difference is that Path of Need is a power card, while Hour of Wrath with Legolas is a game ender. Similar to how Seastan made a deck that could win the game by playing Ravens of the Mountain over and over again, Legolas, while not exhausting could put massive amounts of progress on the quest and keep going even when you go to the next quest phase. You don't just clear the board of enemies, you actually WIN the scenario instantly. All you have to do is defend for a few turns to build up enough enemies and find a way to get more Blades of Gondolin on your characters. I'll have to try it out someday I guess.
