I recently bought the base set and I'm really enjoying it. I want to buy into the saga series but can't find the first one (the black riders) anywhere in Europe. Can I expect a reprint soon or do I have to buy an other expansion? If so what expansion can you guys recommend.

Welcome to the game. Â Unfortunately youâ€™ve discovered itâ€™s most frustrating aspect - getting the exact expansions you want when you want them if youâ€™re outside of the US! Â But donâ€™t be disheartened; the expansions are well worth it.Â  You can either be patient and check checking your stores or buy from the US and pay a bit moreÂ (I used Amazon.com when I lostÂ patience ðŸ˜‚). Â At the moment though Amazon.com isnâ€™t shipping some non-essential items.Â eBay is a waste of time, unless you want to pay a lot more thanÂ normal prices. Â Hope that helps.
