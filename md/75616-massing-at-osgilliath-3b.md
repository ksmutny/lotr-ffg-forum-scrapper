3B is up and there are no enemies in the staging area.  I do not want to lose a hero or ranger to commit my characters to the quest, so I take my chances.  I reveal the top encounter and it is a Ranger of Ithilian.  I take control and he is exhausted and committed to the quest.  I then trigger his surge and reveal a wolves of mordor.  Ranger is questing for 2 the wolves are 1, I gain one and progress to 4A right?  My thinking is that I did not commit any characters so when the Ranger popped up he automatically is committed but is not my character or a character at all since he is an objective and his willpower counts and I don't have to discard him.  Am I correct?

 Very fortunate, but it did allow me to defeat the scenario for the first time so I will take it complice [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/guinyo.gif]
