Glorfindel from the Dwarrowdelf packs reads:

Forced: After Glorfindel exhausts to commit to a quest, raise your threat by 1.

 

Light of Valinor reads:

Attached hero does not exhaust to commit to a quest.

 

So if I attached Light of Valinor to Glorfindel, would his forced text be ignored since he is not exhausting to commit to a quest?

Exactly… The text on Liight of Valinor "cancels" the forced effect on Glorfindel…

This makes Glorfindel a pretty powerful character, considering his starting threat is only 5 for stats that should total 11.

Thanks for the response.

Indeed. He is probably in top-2 of most powerfull heroes.

 

And it seems that Light of Valinor and Asfaloth were design with his card in mind…
