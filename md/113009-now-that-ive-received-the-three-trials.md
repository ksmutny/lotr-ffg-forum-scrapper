...and read the ending of the quest - I can't see any reason why there shouldn't be any dunlendling ally (or even hero, lol) in the next packs of the cycle. 

 

Long story short, the heroes got accepted into the board clan, returned everything they had, thanked a lot and promised that they will make sure that heroes reach Tharbad in safety.

By the way, just tried quest and it's a blast! Such fine balance and filled with theme'n'suspense. Didn't knew if I'm going to win or not until the very last moment. It won't take "my favorite quest" title from Stewards Fear, but it will reside by his side for sure.

Yes that quest is really good. I like it a lot too

Just realized I won last night and forgot to read the ending snippet! Such a good quest, indeed. And without the random surge chaining shenanigans that some recent ones have had...
