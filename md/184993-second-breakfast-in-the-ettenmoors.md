Woo! Been dying for news!

Wow!! The art on those four safe locations is breathtaking

Despite it being mentioned numerous times, I never got the purpose of the Safe keyword. And ideas?

## 5 [PsychoRocka on August 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184993-second-breakfast-in-the-ettenmoors/?do=findComment&comment=1733956)

Its probably in the rules insert for the AP. Maybe you don't make engagement checks while at a safe location or something similar. 

I get why they need to be objective locations now; they have the guarded keyword. Having a side quest be the card guarding an objective (location objective in this case) is pretty gnarly and obviously new. Far more reward than normal for clearing the side quest but also far more important to do so and not something you can just ignore now! (not that many of them can be easily ignored..... they are all pretty brutal and I personally always try to quickly clear and get rid of them)

Baby troll is epic!!!! Also not sure if I have ever seen a better target for Asfaloth than Barren Moorland.... nuts to leaving that awful location in staging for more than a turn or two and nuts to travelling there and having every exhausted character take a damage.

Kinda reminds me of Abandoned Camp from the Nightmare Mirkwood... but that one was immune.

Eugh and does 2 damage instead of 1... I hate that card....

I don't want to say I told you so, but:

 

 

> the reason we created the scenario's Objective-Locations as a new card type was so that they could be Guarded by other encounter cards,

 

 

> Regarding objective locations, thus far the Guarded keyword has only ever appeared on objectives, so maybe they wanted to keep that consistent (Since the article did mention they're all Guarded).

(Also, I lied, I totally want to say I told you so)

Yeah you are right. Totally makes sense now, don't know why I wasn't on the same page as you as it is fairly obvious really. My original comment from way back when seems really silly now (just the part about objective-locations, I stand by my thoughts on Trolls and Olog-hai  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

Is the main FFG site down for everyone else? It's killing me to know that this article exists but I can't read it.

The main site doesn't seem to be down to me. The link in the first post to the article works for me, but it doesn't show up on the FFG news page for some reason (not sure if it's a local issue or their end).

Hmm, seems I can't reach it from my phone, but it works on other machines. Strange.

Liking the idea of zero threat locations with positive effects! We need player card locations next! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

...what?

If Barren Moorland was imuned to player cards effects, it would be like a nightmare deck card.

Lots of typos. He essentially said it's not worth playing until the nightmare version comes out.

This is a security issue. If you see this, you can look for something that says something like "advanced" or "I know what I'm doing" and then there should be a link to proceed to the site anyway.

Yeah, I got the part with a lot of typos, but my translated version had a lot of controversy in it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I'm sure playing Doomed Outland makes a lot of quests "not worth spending a buck". Just find this comment kind of unnecessary. I labeled myself as a theme AND experienced player, and I just reach a 50% win rate normal mode. I'm not getting the whole "we experienced player blah blah nightmare quests blah". Insulting, IMO. To the designers and a vast majority out there.
