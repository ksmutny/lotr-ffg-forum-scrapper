Hi, we are very new to the game, so I apologise if these questions seem dumb..

1. When a treachery card 'deals' damage to characters committed to a quest, is this direct damage that ignores the characters defense or can that damage be reduced/cancelled if the character has a defense value?

2. In the Shadows of Mirkwood quest, we have arrived at 3B Beorn's Path. Ungoliant's Spawn is still hidden somewhere in the encounter deck. Am I correct in thinking that if Ungoliant Spawn remains hidden within the encounter deck and we get 10 progress tokens on this card from questing, that we complete the quest?

3. If an damaged enemy is returned to the Staging Area (e.g. with A LIght in the Dark), does it retain the damage or does the enemy theoretically heal?

4. If you use Dunhere with Unexpected Courage, can Dunhere 1st attack one enemy in the Staging Area, then ready and then attack a different enemy in the Staging Area.

5. Can you play multiple copies of The Favor of the Lady on a single hero?

Hope you can help. Many thanks.

1 - Yes. Any damage that is dealt by card effects does not take in acount the character defense.

 

2 - Yes. Only in the other card you have to search and kill Ungoliant's Spawn. In Beorn's Path, if the Ungoliant's Spawn appears then to be able to win you must kill it.

On note: in the other 3B card, even if you have already killed Ungoliant's Spawn previously, you need to kill it again. In sum, you need to kill it on that particular card….

 

3 - The enemy retains the damage. You only remove damage from an enemy by any card effect. There are none in the Core set…

 

4 - Yes. Both attacks can be legally declared and are able to take place. What you can not do is having Dunhere with Unexpected Courage attack the same enemy twice…

 

5 - There are no restrictions on the number of cards that you can attach to a single character, with two exceptions:

a) the card itself tells you that:

- Keeping Count (TRG): Attach to a hero. Limit 1 per hero;

- Love of Tales (TLD): Attach to a [Lore] hero. Limit 1 per hero;

b) Restricted: a character can only have two restricted attachments.

 

There are some playing restrictions that are mentioned on the attachmente card, like on the two examples above, Keeping Count can only be played on a hero and Love of Tales is even more restrictive by only allow to be polayed on a Lore hero….

 

Hope to have answered to all the questions. Any doubt, feel free to post

Hi Carlos, thank you so very much for taking the time to reply. Your help with our questions is very much appreciated. It's good to know how to proceed correctly now. Thanks again. Best regards.

I have an additional question on question 2

When Don't leave the Path is revealed each player must search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 spider card of his choice and at it to the staging aria.

Do search for Ungoliant's Spawn and ad it also to the staging aria when Don't leave the Path is revealed

or do you play until you reveal it in the quest Phase from the the encounter deck?

Or is it in your best interest to ad Ungoliant's Spawn at that moment to the staging aria?

I'm not good in tactics.

you would generally search for it at that moment- otherwise you risk having to cycle the entire deck

If you complete a quest card making more progress than needed, does the excessive progress tokens go to the next quest card?

No, progress tokens do not carry over between quest cards. They do from locations to quest cards, however. If you quest very successfully and can place 4 progress tokens in total but the current location only needs 2, you remove it and place the other 2 on the quest card (but you probably know this).

Hi, I just started playing the game and I have a quick question:

When committing an ally to the quest in the core set (I think it was a Guide) it says I can place a progress token on an active location. If I don't have any active locations, does that mean I can place it directly on the quest card?

 

Thanks!

## 10 [scottindeed on December 27, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82446-beginners-questions/?do=findComment&comment=939442)

No it only applies to an active location card.. Welcome to the game!
