FFG has been pretty quiet about this game too.

We're thinkers, not talkers. Â ðŸ˜‰

Most chatter for this game has moved to facebook and discord.

There comes a point with a game like this where most of the questions have been asked already. Rules query? Already answered. Weird card interaction you've spotted? Someone already spotted it. Question about an overpowered card? Probably already errata'd.

When a new announcement is made, then there's more discussion.

Until then, manyÂ of us just come here for the Lembas and Ent-draught.

It's been moderately quiet on the reddit side of things too.

I'm doing my best to ask plenty of questions, but with my card pool nearly complete, I only have the announcements to look forward to until I can complete more scenarios.

Sadly, I'm an old guy and don't do much of the social media stuff. I'll keep coming back here, though. Oh, and listening to your podcasts.

Facebook is still a thing? o.O

I just bought Star Wars: Outer Rim and when I went through the product catalog I noticed LOTR LCG had been moved to the last page with the "other games."

I'd make a joke about the game being dead but I just don't see it. The game is just too good and new players are being introduced to it and buying it all the time - when it's in stock.Â 

EDIT: My major time to really get some games in starts next month when I am on vacation. Can't wait!

There's a LotR category under Products page, and the LCG is there. Am I looking in the wrong place?

The catalog included in the game

Could you sendÂ an invitation to join the discord channel?

I'd guess that they wouldn't want a discord invite posted on a public forum, asÂ that's a nice way for spambots to get in.

You may get one via PM instead.

Thought I'd mention that in case anyone wonders.

Edit: have a look at the Cardboard Of The Rings website.

Oh, now it makes sense.
Well, that's rough.
