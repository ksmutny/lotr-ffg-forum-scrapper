During the setup at start of the game do the hero have ressource and can play event to cancel for example a treachery card?

You don't have any resouces during setup. Heroes get resources in the resource phase of the first round.

Also, there is no action window during setup, so you can't play events. You can only trigger heroes' Responses.

 

You can find it in FAQ:

 

(1.19) Card Effects during Setup
“When Revealed” effects are resolved if the cards are revealed during setup. A player can trigger responses during setup, following the normal game rules. Players cannot take Actions during setup.

Actually, I just got confused. I am playing Druadan Forest and after setup I flipped the quest card and reveal an enemy with prowl.

 

So I am not sure: Do I flip Quest card 1A during Setup or at the beginning of my first resource phase?
I think the game begins once the quest is flipped and the heroes did not collect any resources yet. Is that correct?

Setup is before resource phase. Thus, if in 1a force to reveal cards from encounter deck and one of these cards force to you to remove 1 resource token, it is not bad, because you dont have resources still.

Normally, you begin the resource phase in 1b quest card. In setup you resolve 1a text and pass to 1b and resolve his text also, if able.

Hi

Thanks for the quick response. Sorry, but I am still not sure if I understand it correctly. The When Revealed on the 1B Quest card is also revealed as part of setup or already as part of the resource phase?

After you follow instructions on 1a the flip card to 1b and trigger the When Revealed. After these steps are completed then the resource phase starts. So you do not have any resources when stage 1b is revealed. If you have a character like Eleanor you can use her response before the setup is complete though, although she will remain tapped until the end of the first round.

Actually, if you are playing easy mode, you do gain an extra resource during setup...
