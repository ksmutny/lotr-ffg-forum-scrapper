# [One Card to Rule Them All  (March 2012 Card Poll)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/)

This may have been done previously, but I haven't seen a recent poll and with the kick-off of the Darrowdelf cycle I thought it would be fun to have one of these polls.

The voting will be open for 1 week and run until next Sunday (March 11).  All cards in the Core, Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle, Khazad-dum and Redhorn Gate are included in the pool to choose from. 

I'll compile and publish the results after voting ends.  Feel free to respond to as many of the categories as you like.  One set of votes per forum participant.  Only one card per category.  I know some cards only work really well in combination with certain others, but no combos included please.

Maybe consider taking the gate out of this list, as 1 month is barley enough time for it to even get to the stores in many countries outside America, let alone into peoples collections and had them play with them... Also I am assuming you mean player cards.. not Heroes.

Some notes on my choices, I diced that conditional cards might not be a god option (feel free to nominate conditional cards yourself) Like say Support of the Eagles for tactics but this card is 100% useless with out an eagle card getting drawn and cast. I thought it might be best to pick cards that are powerful in their own right as soon as you draw them with out any need for supprt fomr other player cards

Leadership

 * Steward of Gondor (I think this is a given)

Spirit

 * Ziggy (Hard choice Tracker, Test and UC defiantly are up for the most powerful in entire game as well.)

Lore

 * Rivendale Minstrel (This is really hard choice, lore has so many good ones, Still 3 for 2(w) plus a fetch spell for mana fixing? Pretty darn strong)

Tactics

 * Feint.

Most Powerful Playercard

 * Ziggy.

Most Thematic Card

 * These Dunedain Mark - The story of the Dunedain and is very cool, and one of the more interesting back stories that I know of. People coming from the films as their only source might think that Aragon was the only "ranger" but in fact he was only from a single set, the Northern Dunedain. The Arnor and Gondor were also Dunedain and all communicated between each other by a secret series of symbols and marks left though out the word. These acted as a relay of information between Rangers and ever to the other Dunedain factions. I find it quite satisfying that such a small and obscure point as this secret communication, with was also instrumental in the organisation of resistance to Mordor in the War of the Ring is encapsulated in this card as a increase to attack. These marks were basically communication between rangers about teh locations, strength and make up of various enemies you could encounter, allowing the new comers to better defend or attack.. pretty mcuh exactly what the card dose in the game


Nastiest Encounter Card

 * Festering Wounds - Crazy hard choice. I want to say the new khaz troll, and necromancers pass got a think as it is common, but I think of all the cards ever, this is the one that has lost me the game most often though a wipe of the entire board.

Best Artwork (either Player or Encounter Card)

 * Dawn Take You All - This question is just insane.. make it a top 10 at least.. so many good cards... but I think this card is defiantly one of my favs. I think the art is fantastic and I love the glow of the destination. The art matches the theme of the card so well and for those that have toiled in Return to Mirkwood can really appreciate the beauty of the forest road final clearing into a bright open pasture, and the na nice pony ride to the inn. There are many great cards but for me this on I can literally feel the peace and relief that the artist is trying to portray.. not only form the art but teh pack it was packaged ion as well as the effect of teh card itself. Just fantastic and a prime example of why, even with all this games faults, it is still such a beautify crafted game that it tears the eye.

yes i did this a few months back, didnt really kick  off though..............(prepare for another forum software fail....)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Most Powerful Player Card - Leadership Sphere

steward of gondor- an extra 2 resources per turn is useful in so many way, and in so many combos

2. Most Powerful Player Card - Spirit Sphere

unexepected courage-again this can be used in any strategy to a huge advantage

3. Most Powerful Player Card - Lore Sphere

protector of lorien- i love the unlimited willpower buff you get from this,and with a big card draw you can fly through quests

4. Most Powerful Player Card - Tactics Sphere

eagles of the misty mountains- in an eagle deck these can become so powerful, especially when discarding the 1 cost eagle allies after you have played them

5. Most Powerful Player Card - All Spheres (excluding Gandalf)

unexpected courage- as a solo player there really isnt  better card than unexpected courage, it opens up so many options

6. Most Thematic Card (e.g. theme implemented really well by the combination of character/actions or event/actions, etc.)

keeping count- i havnt got this yet, but i love the idea behind it, its a stroke of genius, and thats saying alot as this was a tough one to choose.

7. Nastiest Encounter Card

sudden pitfall- this is horrible....just plain nasty

8. Best Artwork (either Player or Encounter Card)

 argh....so **** hard....but seeing as i can only chose 1, the old ford.

Leadership

Sneak Attack

I would argue it is stronger than Steward of Gondor as it fits every Leadership deck I can think of. In a three or four-player game, having more players with the Steward can be redundant. I have to also mention Faramir as he is probably the best questing boost.

Tactics

Feint

Quick Strike gets an honorable mention, as a runner up. I see that card gaining importance with time.

Spirit

Unexpected Courage

Really hard choice. A Test of Will, Zigil Miner, Northern Tracker, they are all up at the top.

Lore

Gildor Inglorion

Expensive but perfect. I would never play Zigil without him. Henamarth is a great solo card. Strider's Path also almost always handy.

Art

Longbeard Map-Maker

Useless to justify or call runner ups, there are so many. Map-maker is first that comes to mind.

Theme

Gandalf

Very Hobbit-like behaviour. Really like Boromir too.

 

## 5 [ragnarhedin on March 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=602997)

For me the best card for each sphere is about cards that have the potential to drastically alter the course of a quest when they come into play. 

Best Lore

Forest Snare. Shutting down nearly any enemy in the game, engaged with any player, is about as potent an effect as can exist.

 Best Leadership

Sneak Attack. Quick and cheap access to any ally including Gandalf without losing access to the ally later is quite potent.

Best Spirit

Unexpected Courage. Increasing the amount of Hero actions every turn by a third is an amazing opportunity.  With enough luck with draws, you could end up doubling Hero actions.

Best Tactics

Feint. For the same reason as Forest Snare, it isn't as long lasting, but its far more affordable.

Thematic

Probably the multi-functional uses of Gandlaf paired with his moving along at the end of the round.  Represents well his role throughout the texts, whether it be removal of obstacles, elimination of specific foes, or mustering resources.

Art

For me its Bifur, but I just love that Hero.

We mr, we got three out of four spheres just the same, the only one missing being Lore where I got Gildor Inglorion who you have as an avatar. Some coincidence, I just had to say.

## 7 [ragnarhedin on March 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603220)

Hah! just noticed that.  Not intentional I promise. Considered Gildor for Lore and Galadriel's Greeting with Spirit.

## 8 [lleimmoen on March 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603321)

It just shows these cards are very useful. They were from the start and they probably will be even though the game will take some changes.

On the other hand, I love when I find use for a card I had considered poor. It happened to me many times already. The first of those was Son of Arnor.

## 9 [The_Fallen_Arises on March 8, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603430)

  Most Powerful : Leadership

-Steward of Gondor. Ressource acceleration...need I say more ? Especially useful in multi-ressource decks.

 Most Powerful : Spirit

-Dwarven Tomb. Flexibility is the keyword. It effectively gives you additional copies of every spirit card in your hand.

 Most Powerful : Tactics

-Feint. Much needed respite when you're overwhelmed, or when you really need to kill a strong enemy and use everything you got (saaaay like a Nazgul).

Most Powerful : Lore

-Gleowine. Cheap card draw, much needed to get to the good stuff. Can also be used to help out your buddies.

 Most Powerful : Overall

-Steward of Gondor. Ressources ressources...always go for the bottom line !

 Most Thematic Card

-Gandalf. Gonna go with what a fellow forumite said...his many abilities, the fact that he leaves at the end of the round. It's Gandalf all right, only showing up to save the day.

 Nastiest Encounter Card

-Eyes of the Forest. Maybe it's not the worst (Nazgul of Dol Guldur makes my blood boil) but I just hate loosing all my event cards. It,s just so hard te rebuild a hand, it can just throw all your plans right out the window.

 Best Artwork

-Gandalf. I know it's classic but I just love the way he's painted...really captures the character.

great point on Tomb.. I want to modify my post now

## 11 [Thorongil on March 8, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603624)

Lore

Beravor. I almost said Protector of Lorien, as that was my first impulse, but then I realized that the Protector of Lorien is only so good as my card draw, and no single card supplies as many cards as Beravor.

Spirit

A Test of Will. Unexpected Courage is great, especially with Beravor, and the Zigil Miner has prompted the rise of an entirely new deck archetype. In fact, Spirit is loaded with great cards, including Dwarven Tomb, Northern Tracker, and Stand and Fight. However, while the other cards allow you to do things a bit better than other cards can do them, A Test of Will is the *only* card currently in the game that can cancel the worst effects the encounter deck can throw at you.

Tactics

Well, this is the sphere most often left out of my decks, sadly. It's an especially sad fact, given how much I like the concept. Both the heroes Boromir and Legolas deserve consideration in this sphere, and as people have pointed out, Feint is also very strong. However, Feint only deals with an enemy for a single round; it doesn't defeat the enemy. Quick Strike is better in that regard, especially with a souped-up Gimli, who also deserves consideration. In the end, though, I'd have to say the strongest card in this sphere is the Horn of Gondor. Especially in multi-player, this card can generate a good deal of resources, and for all those arguing how the Steward of Gondor is the strongest Leadership card, the Horn sees play less frequently and is, thus, less likely to be redundant in a game.

Leadership

Sneak Attack. Steward of Gondor is right up there, too, but Sneak Attack + Gandalf is the best combo in the game, by far. The versatility this card affords is tremendous, as is the ability to bring allies into play out of the normal turn sequence.

Most Thematic

I like Frodo, here. The ability to deflect damage could be either the mithral shirt or the One Ring, and the conversion to threat is just perfect.

Best Artwork

I look at my heroes more than any other cards, so I'd have to vote for one of them. I'm a big fan of Magali's work, too, so I think I'd have to go with Legolas. It's not an easy choice, though, as there are so many great art pieces.

Thorongil, I like your take. As I see myself, Quick Strike is indeed very powerful. The timing there is crucial.

I thought heroes were out of bounds. That could be another good thread by itself.

Most Powerful Player Card - Leadership Sphere

1A. Sneak Attack - I think that if we did not have Gandalf, this would not be my top card.
2B. Steward of Gondor - I tried really hard not to pick this one, but this would be my top card if Gandalf didn't exist with Sneak Attack.

Most Powerful Player Card - Spirit Sphere

Ancient Mathom - There's a great chance you will eventually explore that location via questing or some other ability. I find this to be an easy 3 card draw engine.  Test of Will is quite popular and I do think it's an excellent card, but I don't feel like choosing it. :-)

 

Most Powerful Player Card - Lore Sphere

Longbeard Map-Maker - Unorthodox card, I know, but he turns Lore resources into Willpower.  I think that's friggin awesome and allows you to have some control with questing with Lore resources.  In addition to that, he has 1 WP, 1 ATK, and 1 DEF with 3 HP... so he can be damage soak as well.

--------

I'll try to comment on the other categories when I get a chance.

 

## 17 [lleimmoen on March 8, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603749)

I just feel like commenting on some of the cards mentioned. I like this thread very much. Different perspectives.

Horn of Gondor. What a great multiplayer card. It is interesting that Steward is getting all the love (obviously) but Horn almost none. I know people here often play solo and then you would really need some autodestructive deck (and get it early) for it to really bear fruit, Rohan plus Eagles perhaps. But I have been recently playing four-player games. There it really shines. One of the games (lasted 5 rounds, 4 completed) I counted how much money it made. We played it one turn one and 11 allies have left play (some due Sneak Attack). If you subtract the cost, it made 10 resources. Steward was also played on turn one (and it is harder to achieve) and it made a total of 8 resources (after you subtracted the cost).

Longbeard Map-maker. I really like that one in my Zi-Gildor deck. I often use a copy or two (if I can get it) to feed Zigil and the one for questing. It is great thematicaly that Lore can deal with questing this way, and with new quests it seems more and more important to quest "just right", being successful is not always helpful.

## 18 [RGun on March 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=603837)

Below are my picks for the first 5 questions.  I need some more time to look through all the encounter cards for the last 3.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Most Powerful Player Card - Leadership Sphere
Steward of Gondor. I play strictly solo and 2 additional resources per turn makes a huge impact.


2. Most Powerful Player Card - Spirit Sphere
The Galadhrim's Greeting. There are several powerful cards in this sphere (e.g. Unexpected Courage, Northern Tracker) but the ability to quickly reduce my threat by 6 has gotten me out of many a jam and often made the difference between victory and defeat.


3. Most Powerful Player Card - Lore Sphere
Protector of Lorien. With a deck built to draw cards quickly this card can let you blast through the last couple of phases of a quest in no time at all.


4. Most Powerful Player Card - Tactics Sphere
Citadel Plate. I had a tough time with this one as I rarely play a Tactics sphere and I suspect there are much better than my selection, especially given it's high cost of 4. I just can't get this sphere to work for me playing solo.


5. Most Powerful Player Card - All Spheres (excluding Gandalf)
Steward of Gondor. Just can't beat those extra resources.

I have One Comment to Rule Them All:

It's very clear that given the proper deck and situation, that some cards are filthier than others.  Perhaps we should distinguish these cards for the numerous situations.

Example:

Best Overall Card for Questing/Escape Tests:

Best Overall Card for Defense:

Best Overall Card for Attack:

Best Overall Card for Shadows:

Best Overall Card for Hero Support(Could be Healing or Resources):

Best Overall Card for Resources:

 

Again I don't really have time to give my 2 cents, but this would be a fun supplement to the discussion!

## 20 [richsabre on March 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=604007)

well depending whether the op wants to include this heres mine

 

Best Overall Card for Questing/Escape Tests:

unexpected courage -(at least from a solo perspective) this means you can quest and stil have a characrer ready for whatever it may be- escape tests/defending etc.

Best Overall Card for Defense:

citadel plate

Best Overall Card for Attack:

eagles of misty moutains- after some sacrifcing of cheap eagle allies these can be beasts

Best Overall Card for Shadows:

burning brand-gets rid of them!!

Best Overall Card for Hero Support(Could be Healing or Resources):

narvis belt-i think this should come under support, as it means you can spread resources over any spheres you like

Best Overall Card for Resources:

im going to have to put my word in for zigil miner as much as ive never gone in for the whole thing, i cant deny its power for resource draw

## 21 [lleimmoen on March 9, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=604066)

As for the Belt Rich, bear in mind that it is good only when you play three sphere decks. Otherwise the Songs are way better: cheaper, neutral, not restricted and searchable, and can be given to any hero. So that is much better unless you have the third (or even fourth) sphere to pay for, right? Well, now that I think about it, the Belt can be versatile in order to attach A Burning Brand or Support of the Eagles, hmm.

yes, thats what i was thinking of- especially when you can '1 turn' it and be lore, to attach what you need, without having to stay lore for the rest of the game

i imagine it will become even better if there is ever a treachery card with deal x damage to (insert sphere) characters though that obviously cant count as its just speculation on my part

i was admitedly forgetting that you have to run leadership to play it!

 Might as well chip in ! I exclude Heroes of course...

 

Best card for questing : Longbeard Map Maker. This one doesn't look like much, but in an hybrid Leadership / Lore deck, and with Dain, this guy has basically 2 willpower and can be pumped up to ridiculous levels of Willpower (with Steward) in case of emergencies.

Best card for defense : Feint. An enemy not attacking is the best defense. I would even go as far as saying it's the best offense since then you can attack with more characters.

Best card for attack : Quick Strike. Striking first is not only the best offense, it also means the best defense, thus completing the cycle ;-)

Best card VS Shadow : It has already been said : Burning Brand. Denethor + Burning Brand = blocks most enemies without nasty surprises.

Best overall card for support : This one ain't easy...I'd say Unexpected Courage.

Best card for ressources. Steward. Of. Gondor.

 

'Nuff said ;-)

1. Most Powerful - Leadership: I never leave home without Steward of Gondor, plain and simple. I don't know about y'all, but I never seem to have enough resources. It does feel like more interesting 0 cost cards are being added, but I'll always want the expensive stuff. 

2. Most Powerful - Spirit: Have you seen those commercials were someone is trying to marry bacon? Well, I want to marry a Lord of the Rings Hero card. And that card is Eowyn. It's almost to the point where I am uncomfortable playing a deck without her. 

3. Most Powerful - Lore: Something about that Forest Snare really makes me feel safe and even in control of the game. 

4. Most Powerful - Tactics: My favorite Sphere by a long shot, just full of cards I like and want to play. I'd probably give it to Gimli. He's super fun and I really liked him in the novels and (to a lesser extent) the films. Get a few damage on him and just go nuts. 

5. Most Powerful - All Spheres: I'm guessing I have to pick one of the above (because Neutral isn't a sphere), of those I'd pick Steward as the most powerful. More resources let you get more stuff on the table. 

6. Most Thematic Card The person who mentioned Gandalf earlier summed up my feelings better than I could have. It has never bothered me that Gandalf comes and goes in the game, because that's the way he is in the story. Busy man.  

7. Nastiest Encounter Card I can hear the Nazgul scream from the films whenever the Witch King hits the table. And I can't beat him. Some day. 

8. Best Artwork: Eleanor.  Don't know that I'd ever play her, but I do so like to look.

I think Elenore is one of the most powerful heroes in the game ... of course Khaz has chanegd things up a bit but she is still awesome. I use her in many of my decks.. Her ability is one of the most powerful in the entire game

During the last deck tweaks, I dumped Eleanor just because she doesn't really have a lot to do in KD, too many cannot be cancelled or non When Revealed Treacheries (god I hate that Doomed 2 + surge one).

i may be missing something but, sorry i cant agree, from a solo view, she isnt much use stats wise, and her action only doesnt even properly get rid of the card-it just replaces it with another one from the deck, and then she's exhausted and you're a hero down and probably not much better off seing that whatever comes from the encounter deck will probably be 1.another treachery or 2.an enemy and yet again you're a hero down

ok so her threat's 7, and with core that was great, but now we have much better 7 cost heros which in my opinion have much better stats and actions

## 29 [booored on March 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61422-one-card-to-rule-them-all-march-2012-card-poll/?do=findComment&comment=604358)

Solo is were she shined the most... as Dam said, Khaz changed things up... but her ability to control treachery is awesome... you are simply not worried, you have a instant test at all times. she has a decent defence low threat... all in all a fantastic card. Perpetually good in solo as you are only drawing a trivial 1 card a round, her ability dose get weaker as you add more draws form the encounter deck as any attachment that tries to ready her is at action speed so for now there is no way to ready her after she cancels an effect.,

1. Most Powerful - Leadership: Rear Guard - especially in single player. I mean for the price of 1 resource, 1 card from hand, and a discarded ally in play you can easily get 2 or even 3 additional willpower for questing! Ok so seriously . . . Sneak Attack or Steward of Gondor are probably the card, but I give a HEAVY honorable mention to Timely Aid which I think is more universally useful than Sneak Attack and doesn't have uniqueness limitations of Steward.

2. Most Powerful - Spirit: Northern Tracker - I can't believe this hasn't been posted as a winner yet. I would argue it is the most game changing card you can put in play - and by game changing I mean after you play it, you are playing a significantly different and much easier game. Unexpected courage is cool and all, but outside of a very short list of heroes (Beravor, Denathor, Eleanor and possibly Gimli) or crazy attachment stacks, it is roughly matched by playing a powerful ally. Test of will - one time only, not game changing. Zigil Miner is awesome as well and probably is the best card IF you build your deck around him - although one of the key reasons my Ziggy deck kicks so much asphalt is because it makes it easier to buy a certain Dunedain. Northern Tracker fits in any deck and dominates.

3. Most Powerful - Lore: Daughter of the Nimrodel - Probably not a sexy pick, but Lore isn't particularly top heavy in overpowered cards. I MISS having a Daughter available in games and is one of the primary reasons I am looking to buy another core set so that they can be sprinkled in more of the decks I maintain. It keeps heroes alive and synergizes with Gloin for a resource machine that can match Steward plus you can have multiple in play to stack the fun.

4. Most Powerful - Tactics: Landroval - Eagles rock. It is almost unfair to call one out. But this guy attacks at 3, is a good defender, is sentinel, AND it operates as a Fortune or Fate. The only problem is the expense. Winged Guardian would be my second choice as the ability to get out a 4 defense Sentinel cheaply is incredible.

5. Most Powerful - All Spheres: Northern Tracker - I am guessing that people hyped themselves out on this card a year ago. Sure the recent quests have been more beefy in their number of quest tokens required which mitigates its power. But keep in mind all of those games that you've lost because you got behind on questing and locations. If you can't overquest the staging area, you can't get past the current location, which means you can't clear any locations and they just pile up getting worse and worse. Now think back to those games, I would bet you didn't have an NT in play. Why? Because that doesn't happen with NTs where you are always just a few turns from auto-killing locations. AND it is one of the better all around combat allies in the game as well. Those that can defend better - Gandalf, Gildor, Beorn, Eagles of the Misty Mountains. Those that can attack better - Gandalf, Beorn, Veteran of Nanduhirion, Landroval, Vassal of the Windlord

6. Most Thematic Card: Keeping Count - very cool . . . but so useless unless I go buy 3-6 more.

7. Nastiest Encounter Card: Sudden Pitfall - the king of suck, blow, and unfairness. See http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/773906/overpowered-encounter-cards [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/773906/overpowered-encounter-cards] for details. It has been banned in my house.

I believe the answers may depend on quests that the posters prefer. I agree about Northern Tracker being one of the most powerful cards in the game but with the expansions there are quests in which he is not THAT useful, he is always useful but he completely steals the ones like Dol Guldur (nasty locations that need 1 or 2 tokens only). I, for instance, really like playing the Carrock and there I often leave the Tracker sit even though I get him because I just need not quest that heavy or get rid of numerous locations. Thus I would still argue Courage is generally more powerful Spirit card although I like Tracker better from the point of theme and art.

As for the Eagles, I like Vassal the best, especially in combo with the Support. But the Guardian is just as great, probably depends what the deck (or scenario) needs more.

Best Overall Card for Questing/Escape Tests:

Unexpected Courage is very strong by itself for obvious reasons, but I also like Dunedain Quest or Favor of the Lady to boost characters not usually seen questing.  For Escape tests, this allows for much greater flexibility in overall strategy and hedges bets against losing main questers to treachery cards.

Along with that I would also list Dain. For my builds his main purpose is all of the ancillary quest he brings through dwarves in play. Again he benefits questing, but is has far more impact for escape tests.

Best Overall Card for Defense:

Allies: Winged Guardian, Gondorian Spearman, or Erebor Hammersmith (cost 2 for 1 Def and 3 HP)

Attachment: Burning Brand - in a game where threat is built on unpredictablility, any sure thing is positive

Best Overall Card for Attack:

Completely situational so I'll say Gandalf because 4 automatic damage to any enemy in play is too potent to ignore

Best Overall Card for Shadows:

Dunedain Watcher - a fairly solid character for the cost without her special, but the special puts her over the top.

Best Overall Card for Hero Support(Could be Healing or Resources):

The songs for multi sphere decks otherwise maybe citadel plate

Best Overall Card for Resources:

On its own Steward of Gondor, for dwarf decks its Narvi's belt.

My post stayed accurate for only 24 hours. http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3135 [http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3135] Sleeping Sentry is hands down the worst Encounter card. Now I have to figure out a punishment worse than banning from my house otherwise I am not being fair to Sudden Pitfall which is a cuddly teddy bear in comparison..

 Bummer about the poll closing. I was hoping to vote at the end of this week. That'll teach me to procrastinate! I just don't know the cards well enough yet to vote without rifling through my entire stack.

 If I had known I could not vote for Gimli and Eowyn (I assume my Elenaor vote was permitted) I would have gone with Northern Tracker and probably Feint.

as interesting as this was i see a problem.....

the problem now is that when would you do the next one?  next month and the results are likely not to differ- most countries are still waiting for Dwarrowdelf #1

you would have to wait for everyone to get say an entire 6 cycle, to make the results above differ any.....and with the spread of countries and when they are released it may take a while before it would be a fair vote

 I plan to do the next one several weeks after last adventure pack from Darrowdelf expansion is released.

One interesting thing to note.  All of the player cards people selected as the most powerful, come from the core set (in fact 80%ish of the votes went to core set cards).   And most of the power cards were uncommons, not rares. 

What can we learn for that?  Despite some initial concerns, we aren't seeing a huge amount of power creep  Also, if you want to field top flight decks, you probably want two sets of core, but you probably don't need a third.

Yes, good call. UC being an exception, that card should have been there at least twice in the core set. I understand why not have more of Beorn's Hospitality, Grim Resolve, or even Horn of Gondor (being unique) but with Courage they just wanted people like me to run for more boxes.

Zigil being usually the one non-core card that gets most love. It is Gildor for me though.

Not sure about the other LCGs but in CoC some of the most powerful cards are still from Core as well and that game is like 6 cycles deep + 2 xpacs... ..

what you do is use sleeves.... place a "real" card in the sleeve, then place the print of the new face in the front of teh sleeve.. so the card looks exactly like the rest of the cards in your deck form the back. Incidentally this is also how you run custom scenarios.

Yes sleeves rocks... just another reason why.

Look if you want to not use sleeves then the only other way is to print out your entire deck your planning to play with. Otherwise your right, there will always be a visible difference in the cards that you can see and will inform you of the next draw..

One of the entire points of the opaque sleeve covers is for exactly this function. It was a device that came into being form the CCG days when a single card could be like a 80 bucks easy. It isn't "me" it is how the card games work.. you think it is a coincidence the Official LoTR opaque sleeves have the encounter deck and player deck card backs on them? No it is for exactly this use.. custom encounter deck cards and proxies.

Also worth noting that when you do a proxy this way you can print on normal paper, no need to print on card baord or print double sided.

Heroes seem to be the non-core cards that I gravitate towards the most (well, eagles). Frodo and Boromir immediately spring to mind.

 You know, richsabre, another way you can proxy is just to choose cards you aren't playing with in your deck, and call them the card you want to proxy. For example, if you have no hobbits in your deck, throw in two Fast Hitch and one Unexpected Courage, then treat the Fast Hitches like UC. I haven't done this yet, but I've thought about it. Maybe I have an overactive conscience, but playing with proxies feels like stealing to me.

I believe that if you already own a copy of the cards, proxies are acceptable.  I would't really want to buy additional core sets just to get 1 or 2 more of just a few more cards.  I don't need the extra encounter decks that it comes with, so that would be a tremendous waste.  If there was a way to buy just the core set cards from the hero deck, that would be a reasonable option.  The adventure packs already come with 3x of each card, so there isn't an immediate need to buy more unless I am too lazy to keep track of those cards in multiple decks.

thanks for the ideas, though i was just curious how this is done- i have no intention to proxy- im far too OCD
