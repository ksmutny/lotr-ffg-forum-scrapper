Oh my god!! I have just seen this card and its the best bit of artwork ive seen. In my mind throughout the books, i always pictured her as a beauty and the artist has totally done her justice. Cant wait to get this set then she will have her own place on the pillow beside me!!!

Ted, I absolutely agree: the art is gorgeous and ethereal, and the best part is that she is a darn good card!  I already have her 3 copies in my primary deck. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 I didn't notice this on the spoiler, but I just noticed the flavor text on Arwen says, "…in whom it was said that the likeness of L thien had come on earth again…"

FFG really needs a spell checker.

Yeh it looks like she can trigger a pretty tasty defence on the right card.

Hmm. I checked the preview [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/Dwarrowdelf/the-watcher-in-the-water/arwen-undomiel-ally.png] and it has Lúthien written, so at least they had it right at some point.

This is a fantastic card! It's probably one of the only uniques I will run a full 3 copies of in my deck, the other one being Gleowine. I wish more of the cards in the set had been this good. Getting tired of spending $10 just to get 1 good player card in a sphere that is already awesome.

Depending on what type of deck you use, there are 5 top notch player cards in Watcher.  Some packs don';t give us much, but this isn't one of them.

 

The Blade That Was Broken - If you run aragorn and have access to leadership, this is a willpower boost that rivals faramir. 

Resourcefulness  - For secrecy decks, this is a must-have card.

Legacy of Durin - Every dwarf deck that uses lore should include three of this card. It may be the most powerful single card in a strong set.

Arwen - As previous posters have said, another winner.

Elrond's Counsel - 3 threat reduction and +1 will for the cost of just the card?  I will take it.  Especially when the only requirement is that you get Arwen into play.

Believe me, this card looks better than it is. Honestly, this card is crap, because you won't be able to exhaust her. Who wants to look at that face in a 90 degree angle? Who? Who? WHO???????

Hence, no one is going to exhaust Arven EVER. Ok, perhaps when they provide us with a card that allows us to exhaust characters without turning them sidewards. Like this:

 

Honeymoon

Action: Kiss a character card  to exhaust it.

Unless theres the million to one chance that you're playing partner is liv tyler, then you can happily exhaust arwen and still have the benefit of seeing the beauty. She would, of course, have to have the big elven ears attached while playing.(So be prepared for her to decline the invitation, knowing that she has to "ear up" before coming over to yours for a game)

not that im saying liv isnt beautiful-she is….ive just always thought her a poor choice for arwen…though imagination is a taste

I cannot but agree, she was one of the worst casting decisions, and all the worse probably done to have a well known face in it, which otherwise wasn't the trend at all. I liked the casting overall. I like the one for the Hobbit even much more.

## 12 [Robert McMutton on April 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63626-arwen-undomiel/?do=findComment&comment=623161)

I agree with both of you. She was a deception to me when I had known that she got the role for Arwen. A pity.

## 13 [Ted Sandyman on April 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63626-arwen-undomiel/?do=findComment&comment=623221)

I have to disagree gentlemen, but thats just a taste thing. Who would you like to have been cast in that role, out of interest? My first choice would have been angelina jolie but i was happy with liv.

It's about taste of course, but I was thinking in Kate Beckinsale.

Oh yeh i forgot about her. She would be perfect. Naturally beautiful, which is a rarity.

## 17 [Shelfwear on April 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63626-arwen-undomiel/?do=findComment&comment=623332)

Nope, worst casting for LotR was another Elf: Haldir, the chubby elf with a five o'clock shadow…

Right now I would have cast Olivia Wilde - just because of the looks, she is not a great actress but at least as good as Liv Tyler and she is certainly better looking, much more female-like, I would go as far as saying much more Elf-like.

In the male department I really like how they go almost entirely American-free for the Hobbit. Brits are just so much better in general. But they could go for more Scandinavian actors as well.

Now, I appologize in advance with both of these statements, I do not want to cause havoc over them. It is just a matter of taste as has been mentioned.

LOVED the casting of Liv and thought she did a wonderful job as Arwen.

But to be fair, I've always loved Liv even before the LotR movies. Empire Records, That Thing You Do, Armageddon, etc.

not letting the fact that im english sway my opinion- i think it was important that a good majority of the cast were english, given that tolkien was, and as in my chapter that discusses this (a time and a place) based much of the places in middle earth in english locations

## 21 [Ted Sandyman on April 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63626-arwen-undomiel/?do=findComment&comment=623980)

Yeh i agree with getting the accent right. Sean Astin(sam) had a devonshire twist to his english accent which i thought suited the hobbit way of life as thats what we're like down here. A slow pace of life, farmers/gardeners etc with not much care for the outer world. For an american (i think) he did a great job.

Why yes you can!

and she sells prints at:

I just got a print of her Legolas art. I won it from the Cardboard of the Rings guys for getting the most votes in their Watcher in the Water design contest.

The prints are beautiful, I would definitely reccomend getting one.
