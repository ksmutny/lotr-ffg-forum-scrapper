  So if the first play exhaust his last characters to defend against a mob, then the second play resolves his enemy attacks then attacks my mob with Brand and readies one of my ranged characters can my ranged help with his attacks or even attack his mobs alone?

ziryab1 has played too much WoW :-)

A mob is short for a monster in a MMORPG, a computer-controlled character (as opposed to one controlled by another player).

He simply means a character, an enemy one or an Ally

According to the rules, first player must resolve all his attacks before the second player does. So, if Brand is controlled by the first player, then he can ready second player characters, so they can attack in the same round. If Brand is controlled by a second player, he can still use his ability, but the readied characters won't be able to do much (apart from their "exhaust abilities").

Remember that after each attack players may take actions. So, the following situation is allowed:

 1. second player attacks with Brand an another player enemy and defeats it
 2. as a result he readies one of the first player characters
 3. this readied character cannot attack this turn (because first player has already attacked with his characters), but he can use his "exhaust abilities" if it has one
 4. second player attacks next enemy with another unexhausted character

One more thing from the rules - "each player can declare an attack (with any number of eligible attackers he controls) against each enemy with which he is engaged once each round".

Let me know if you understand :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think I understand. Brand can ready the first players ranged character, but all he will can do is use his exhaust abilities or participate in an attack triggered by the second player with an readied character. If the the second player has no ready characters then the ranged character can not attack any enemies. Correct?? Thanks for your input.

Yeah, you've got it right. Here's the relevant rules text (p. 24):

Ranged
A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players. A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack. [emphasis mine]

So, if your ranged character is readied after your attack phase has passed, you won't be able to declare attacks with it by itself; however, you will be able to exhaust it or have it join a subsequent attack declared by the second player. You have to be somewhat careful when using Brand, as his utility is a bit more limited when you aren't the first player. That's why I like to run him opposite Beravor--you'll never have to worry about "wasting" Brand's ability.
