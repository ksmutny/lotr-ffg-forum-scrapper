So uh... what’s the best approach to selling LotR LCG content?

I’ve got a couple core sets and several of the ~$30 and ~$15 expansions, but I feel like I can’t enjoy this game without owning most of the content which just isn’t an option for me right now.

Plus, now that I’ve tried the new LotR game at Adepticon, I feel like that will scratch the itch that LotR LCG showed me I had, at a much more affordable rate of enjoyment.

Any suggestions for where I should post/list it? Should I do it as one lot or sort out the expansions I have or...?

There's a LOTR LCG Facebook group where I've seen people occasionally sell off their collections. Mostly is currently people posing photos of their just-arrived orders :)

Whether you split or sell as a bundle kinda depends what packs you have.

That said, I don't have much and still enjoy a game... even if I'm a bit rubbish. Being a solo gamer, I learned to accept failure :)

I'd be surprised if you found a seller for the whole bundle together, but their are several people who have huge chunks missing in their collection. With reprints the way they are, there's a chance one of them might be willing to shell out some cash.

I was okay with some failure, but it got to the point that my wife absolutely did not want to play because most of the missions I owned were near impossible with my card pool.

Would you also suggest checking Facebook or do you know of anywhere that might be better?

I would just post a thread here or on BGG with a link to whatever platform you decide to sell it on. eBay or the BGG’s geekmarket would be my first choices.
