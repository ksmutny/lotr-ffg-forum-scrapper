Hey, a while ago I was looking at the COTR facebook page and came across a fan-made Brand son of Bain alternate art card they gave away as a prize or something, and when I saw that art I was blown away. That art is completely amazing, so I looked for it high and low but could not find the image of either the card nor the art. Does anyone have a digital image of the fan-made card who can post it here please?

Yeah, the card was made by Shelfwear, who posted it on boardgamegeek.com

It's a painting by Allen Douglas:

Thank you so much! I knew Shelfwear had made the card but even then I could not find it. I guess I should have looked up his BBG page...

That artwork reminds me of Mark Wahlberg.
