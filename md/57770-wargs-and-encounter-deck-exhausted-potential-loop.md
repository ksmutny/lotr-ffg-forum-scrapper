# [Wargs and encounter deck exhausted - potential loop](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57770-wargs-and-encounter-deck-exhausted-potential-loop/)

 What happens when wargs cannot get the shadow card?

Do they stay engaged or go back to the staging area?

I think the first as the condition is not met (no shadow cards without shadow effect).

What do you think?

 

Moreover if I was playing the last quest card of "Journey Along the Anduin", I would skip the staging step of the quest phase - so no need to reshuffle the deck.

And if the wargs were meant to go back to the staging area, I would definitely get a loop until my threat raises to 50 due to the passing of rounds.


Does it make sense?

if im reading this question right then the answer is that the deck never runs out, it resets everytime you run out of cards

This quest-specific rule only skip the staging step of the quest phase, so the quest phase is stil there (you still have to commit characters and compare the will-power with threats in staging area), and therefore the encounter deck discard pile would still need to be reshuffled to form the encounter deck.

You do not reshuffle the encounter deck during the combat phase if it runs out of cards then.

I say there is no loop: since there was no card dealt to the warg, there was no way to say "the shadow card had no effect", since there was no card!

Forced: If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return Wargs to the staging area after it attacks.
Shadow: Attacking enemy gets +1 ATK. (+2 ATK instead if this attack is undefended.)

The Forced effect does not occur as no shadow card was dealt. In the next quest phase the encounter deck will be reshuffled.

Skipping the staging component of questing does not mean you do not reset the Encounter deck if it has no cards in it. The rules state:

"If the encounter deck is ever out of cards during the quest phase, the encounter discard pile is shuffled and reset back into the encounter deck. "

So if at anytime during the quest phase not just the staging component of the quest phase.

thank you!

I only missed the latter quote from the rules, then.

In fact I thought that, as the phrase was under the Staging paragraph, it was not to be applied - as the phase was skipped (no need to draw, no need to reshuffle).

Uh? Oh?

This doesn't make any sense, even if the rules state so. I mean, the encounter deck lies just in front of you, you need a shadow card, so why not simply reshuffling the encounter deck to get said shadow card? sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]

 

And who that brutal to tell the Wargs that they get no shadow card "this time"? Right in their ugly face? I promise that leaves you with a will-broken creature.

 I'm not sure what the design motivation for that rule was, but that is in fact the rule.  The rulebook is quite explicit.
