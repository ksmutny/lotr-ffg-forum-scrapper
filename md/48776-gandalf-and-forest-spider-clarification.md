Hi to all.
I'm an italian player who just started this wonderful game! I'm enticed!

Probably because of the transation I need a clarification on Gandalf and the Forest Spider. Can you help me?

FOREST SPIDER: If I volontary engage it (before engagement checks) it still gets is +1 Attack or engaging it circumvents this effect?

GANDALF: At the end of the round Gandalf is discarded in the discard pile of his player or is totaly removed from the game, put away in the box? I think the latter, but I prefer to verify ^^

Hi!

 

1.: The first round you fight against it (doesn't matter if you engaged it by your choice or not), it gets +1 Att. But my interpretation is also based on a translation, my game is in german.

 

2.: Discard pile.

Cheers!

You are right on both counts, engaging and being engaged are the same thing mechanically. This is specified in the English rule book on P.16

Whether an enemy is engaged through an engagement
check, through a card effect, or through a player’s
choice, the end result is the same, with the enemy
and the player engaging one another. In all cases, the
player is considered to have engaged the enemy and the
enemy is considered to have engaged the player.

Thanks! I played my first game yesterday and was wondering exactly this!

Thank you to all.

Just out of curiosity, there is, at the current state of the game, a way to deny its bonus to the Forest Spider? The Att. value is useful, AFAIR, only after it engages you. Isn't it, now, basically a 3 Att. monster?

On the turn it engages you, the Forest Spider is 3 ATT, for all following turns it is 2 ATT. Other than things like Feint that prevent the Spider from attacking, there is currently no way to avoid the +1 ATT bonus.

Using Sneak Attack with Son of Arnor after the enemy attack step. Of course that requires you to have less than 25 threat.
