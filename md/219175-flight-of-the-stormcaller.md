How long has it been available on the FFG page, Cool Stuff Inc., and Miniature Market?Â  Normally I see a news topic about it, but haven't seen one yet.

Looks like the product page was updated yesterday, but I hadn't heard anything from my local retailer about it yet and FFG hasn't made the usual news post either. Still no post from FFG but the product is in at my local retailer.
