Hoi

Are we in the optional engagement phase allowed to engage an enemy with HIGHER threat then then the player has?

Does the threat even count in the optional engagement phase or is it only used for the engagement checks?

You can engage any one enemy in the staging area.  So, yes.

Yes, the threat check is just to see if they choose to engage YOU. Its generally good to take care of the biggies before they come to you if you can. I think the only one I know of that doesn't let you under certain conditions is the sniper- you can't engage it if other monsters are left.
