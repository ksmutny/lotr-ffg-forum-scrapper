Does anyone know if FFG has a practice of replacing lost cards as a customer service?

 

I just built a new deck and discovered that I can only find 2 copies of A Very Good Tale, even after going through every card in my collection.  Where could it be?

 

I know that I can just proxy, but that's no fun.  What have you done when you lose a card?  And can they be replaced?  Thanks!

well I do know that they have replaced damaged or missing cards in the past when people have opened the box...but this isn't the same thing. I don't think they do, but I cannot say for sure

 

I do know there was (or still is) a store that sells singles, but they are 'rares' from the core set and cost a huge amount ...

 

its a shame...I havnt lost a card yet, thank god...

 

Ps - I did just move house and miraculously I lost none of my 1000s of cards....though there was a point where I lost The Long Dark, but then it was down the side of the car seat...phew :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Hmmm.

Lost a few, but always found them later on.

You didn't throw it out with the trash or sucked it up into your vacuum cleaner did you?

Maybe your dog ate it? Otherwise it should resurface sooner or later.

As for asking FFG, I hear their customer support is great, so you can always try.

But I'm not too sure if they do this; if so I will report my single copy of UC lost then too!

My understanding is that FFG would not do this - their policy on it states that replacements due to customer error are not covered.

However I think that they might do it if you ask anyway. (The purpose of the statement is to allow them to refuse unreasonable requests, a single card one time, might be okay).

Thanks for the tips!  I recently moved and still have hopes that it will turn up somewhere, but can't find it now for the life of me.  I'm sure a rash of missing Unexpected Courage cards will show up if FFG is willing to replace a single!

I have seen German singles on ebay for nearly every card in existence. They're a bit expensive (depending on where you live) but they're worth it IMO if it's just that one card. I plan on buying a bunch of staples myself, SoG, Feint, Foe Hammer, Daeron's Runes, etc

The thought of sending a package containing one little card is funny......

Hope your card shows up!

Hope you find it
