what do we all think? ……..much needed development? or not?

i know i posted about the game's difficulty but i dont think i will do this- it feels like cheating…(read that last comment very carefully please)

well sort of. i guess it is a good idea though and i congratulate the designers on doing this.

rich

PS. i may as well say this outloud so im not spending my day tomorrow with pointless arguments- this is a great thing for the game….i just personally wont use it (at least i dont think so….time will tell)

this may bring me back to the game. I left because it was just too **** hard and I'm just a casual player. I rarely won any scenario, even the first one. So, now that I've sold it all, I might just come back, or I may still wait to see if Pathfinder Cards game offers a more satisfying psuedo-rpg experience. We'll see. I'm intrigued though!

An essential print out. Having more options is a great thing IMO. Sometimes I just want to play and not get my ass handed to me (I have the nightmare decks for that). And should Easy mode be just that, I can play standard. It's a win win as far as I'm concerned. I'm glad FF is listening. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

it's funny, i was just joking w/my buddies how the FFG forums will have a post about how the easy mode is "cheating" - and here it is! ;D

this is nothing but a positive. video games do this. i don't know of many of other game formats that have variable difficulty. it's one more sign that the game designers actually listen to the fan base. there are now three modes to play the game. it seems silly to me, especially after all the complaints about the "difficulty" of the game, to now complain that, once the designers have addressed the issue, that it's "cheating."

props to caleb et al for listening and really putting a lot of effort into the game to make it better. we now have a great way to introduce the newer quests to new players - maybe not always having to rely on Passage Through Mirkwood, or some other similarly simple quest.

Thank goodness I say!  So many times I wish that the game was made easier.  No more getting demoralized and resisting the urge to throw my cards at the table in disgust.  I will play several games at wussy level for sure!

Probably i will use to introduce newcomers to the game…

perhaps you need to re read my post, so you dont end up a repeat of your last infamous post by insulting another fellow gamer. im not arguing here. the basic fact is that to me it FEELS like cheating, hence i said i doubt id use it.

of course it isnt- thats the whole point of ffg making this official rules

therefore thats why i added the last about congratulating the designers. the introduction of this is only a good thing, but to me im not so sure about it

By the way if you look at the Easy Mode rules on the Support page you can see some spoilered names for some cards of the Against the Shadow cycle.

## 10 [Ellareth on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795529)

It's funny to see how some of the cards that are removed to achieve easy mode are the 'iconic' cards of that expansion/encounter set.
Chieftain Ufthak, Marsh Adder, Hummerhorn, majority of Hunters from Mordor, most of trechery from Rhosgobel, Mumakil, Old Tomnnody, etc.

But it's always good to have more option to play.
I don't think Easy Mode is cheating, especially since it is an official variant posted by the developers,
and I could actually see myself using this mode.

Play standard mode when playing a new quest,
Play nightmare mode when playing with a finely-tuned cutting-edge deck,
Play easy mode when playing a Cycle of quests using thematic decks.

Edit: Just realized I didin't explain why I think easy mode is 'legetimate' way to play.
I would probably dismiss this easy mode as 'cheating' as well if it was fanmade variant.
Only reason I would consider it otherwise and actually give it a try myself is that it came from the developers,
and even then I might have dismissed the easy mode as 'temporary fix' to quiet the increasing complaints about difficulty.
But Caleb and other developers are doing such a good job with LotRLCG that I am trusting this easy mode is a 'balanced' way of reducing difficulty to enable players to try out thematic decks… and I've been playing without Denethor for too long.

i know exactly what you said. and i know you weren't dissing the designers. i was merely giving my opinion by stating that this is in no way cheating (much in the same way i never thought not using shadow cards your first couple play-throughs was cheating). it was tongue-in-cheek. and there is nothing in my post (at least, i don't think) suggesting i was going to argue.

perhaps i miss read you, but this is an opinion forum afterall, and mocking someone's opinion is surely doing nothing other than inviting argument

i shall leave it at that as i dont want to sidetrack a thread on an important part in this game's development

## 13 [Dain Ironfoot on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795537)

my response wasn't so much to you personally, rich, as it was a response to the "is it needed or not/feels like cheating?" - question/topic you posed in the orignal posting. while i can understand you taking it personally, it was responding to the topic - not the author (so yes, i think you misread/misinterpreted what i was saying).

even so, i absolutely believe it's counterintuitive to feel that way, especially given all the rampant complaints about the game being too hard (again - not a comment directed towards you specifically).

you can't please all the people all the time. some think the game is just right. others too easy. and some too hard. the designers have addressed this - to a greater extent than any other game. and this is nothing short of a good thing. if someone thinks the game is too hard and doesn't utilize the game mechanics provided to them by the designers, that's their right.

## 14 [starhawk77 on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795539)

Terrific move. Those who want to take advantage of it will do so, and those who don't need or want to play Easy Mode won't have their gaming experience affected at all. It may bring frustrated players back to the game, which is great for the long-term vitality of LotR. 

Of course, we've always been able to do this. Some players have been adding and removing select encounter cards to adjust difficulty for quite some time. Still, it's different when FFG officially endorses that model and provides a standardized framework. 

Allowing players maximum ability to customize their play experience--while still playing by a version of FFG's official rules--is the right thing to do. There's absolutely no downside here. 

## 15 [Gizlivadi on May 14, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795556)

This is/was a very important day for Lotr LCG. New Saga expansion AND easy mode announced in the same day… I personally love the idea of an easy mode and look forward to try a thematic deck against an easy mode scenario. 

## 16 [Zalrus9 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795577)

I, for one, welcome our new Easy Mode Overlords. One of the faults I find of this game is that the difficulty comes from a lot of "screw you" cards (I'm looking at you, Sleeping Sentry!). With those out of the way, I'm excited to see how the quests turn out. Will they become more fun, or more boring? I don't know yet, but I'm going to play through some and find out!

## 17 [Runix on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795593)

This is a great move, and will very likely tempt me back to playing the game.

I had quietly dropped the game for a number of reasons, but most prominent of those was the difficulty.  It felt like the loudest advocates of the game were - to borrow FFG's terminology - "Boromirs", players who apparently think that a 10% win rate is too high and Sleeping Sentry was the FFG designer's finest moment.  FFG literally was "turning it up to eleven" on difficulty, and since I had no interest in that, I had no intention of sticking around.

FFG has, wisely, decided to cater to a wider audience.  The masochists now have their difficulty 11 decks that will require a hundred play-throughs before they can defeat it with their every-OP-card-in-the-game solo deck, while those of us who just want to enjoy the theme while experimenting with interesting deck builds will be able to do so without getting repeatedly drubbed by bad card draws.

Granted, those of us who play on Easy Mode will have to endure the condescension of the hardcore gamers, but in my mind that's less of a price to pay than having to hate the game because of painful win/loss ratios on the scenarios.

## 18 [DarthJalapeno on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795600)

Easy mode is great for us (wifey and me)!

## 19 [Zalrus9 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795603)

So I just played Into Illthillan on Easy Mode with a Secrecy Deck, and I have to say I had a good time! The deck was much thinner, and it was still hard, but I felt like I had more of a chance. I unfortunatly did not win, but I got to the last stage of the quest. I don't know if I will play all of the quests on easy mode, but I might try some of the harder ones. 

## 20 [asmeus on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795613)

This is great for me.

I, myself, have nothing against losing hard, however my gf rage quits for weeks, if we lose.

(Can't really enjoy the game, if I have to min/max our decks for several hours, to ensure success. Especially hard with other things, like my gf really dislikes dwarves)

Now I'll be able to throw together some thematic cards and have a blast. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Absolutely necessary and about time! We were actually very confused with the new nightmare option, because we already felt the games biggest weakness is it's difficulty.

I can only tell you from my point of view: When the game was new my whole gaming group played it. By now everyone (but me) has given up on the game, because it was just to difficult to be fun. They all got frustrated with one scenario or another (or several in a row) and dropped out at some point. They had realised that you need to put a lot of efford in research and deckbuilding (and card buying) to have a chance with the new scenarios. Most of my friends are casual gamers and don't visit any forums (and therefore their voices will never be heared). I cannot blame them and I too was very close to throwing my cards a couple of times.

In general I never play anything in the "easy mode", but here I will (propably often). Actually the introduction of easy mode is not enough in my opinion, because it gives people the feeling they are cheating, or that they are infirior players. I think they should have just made standard easier and sell "hard mode" to the players that want an additional challenge. Furthermore I hope it's not too late, because I am pretty sure a LOT of players have given up on this (great) game already.

Sorry for double but I just read this: 100% the same for me, thanks!

Good to read this. I think FFG is scaling way to much for the (more visible) geeks.

Right. This may help me get some friends to play it. They complain even without dealing Shadow cards.

BTW: We'll see Easy mode Print on Demand packs?

## 24 [Kcall07 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795634)

I agree with the consensus. This is fantastic news. It's good to see, just from this thread, a lot of people thinking of coming back to the game. Long term players will know that the difficulty becomes manageable with time, but we all remember struggling with the core set. I think FFG should include these rules, and the highlighted cards, with future reprints of the core set. It will make the game so much more accessible to new players.

its probably completely against the point, but me and my play partner were thinking of trying easy mode as a challenge, only using one or two heroes. We'll see how that goes haha …

## 25 [Attercop on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795639)

I for one am delighted by these changes!

I often said to my brother, (a fellow enthusiast), that if they just removed a few cards or reduced their numbers I would be happy. I know that some people would have said 'just do it then', but I never wanted to, because as Rich said it would have felt like cheating. But now that FFG have released an official set of rules to make an easier game possible, I'm going to dive right back into my favourite co-op system. 

Thank you so much FFG!!!

## 26 [player1761766 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795649)

It is good to see people coming back to the game, yeah! I think I'll definitely try some of the newer quests without some of these cards, in the hope that I might actually get to stage 2 of some quests. 

There's a wonderful document on the Arkham Horror support page where the game's designers share some of their house rules and other thoughts on 'amending' the game in various ways, either to make it more difficult or less so. Somewhere in there, they say something like 'the goal is to have fun, so do whatever you're comfortable with', and that has become something of a mantra for me with all the games I play now. It is all about balance, of course, rather than making a game so easy it provides no challenge and you know you're going to win before you open the box. Maybe it's the GM in me coming out, but I value flexibility in a game to keep it going and to enjoy it. I go to work to be miserable, I don't need any other methods of achieving miserability! With this new variable difficulty mode I think the designers have make an excellent step in that direction - and unlike the Nightmare decks, it doesn't cost a penny to play easier!

This is exactly it for me as well. I may use easy mode on some quests that I have, in the past, found to be really tedious. The whole fun thing is a bit like Battlestar Galactica: the cylon player *can* play just to win, but it's so much more enjoyable for everyone if they play to win in a way that draws the game down to an exciting conclusion. Some of my favourite games of LotR have been when the encounter deck did just enough to make the last turn really tense, but didn't just whomp me. I may even play Watcher in the Water again now…

Good move. At least they win not do easy quest bu them self if they make a opportunity to make the quest more difficult. But from other side people dont need to buy 2 or 3 core set since there is easy mode rules………

For me i dont care cose i love nightmare play and i happy game diffiuculty will not go down generaly  very good!

I think it is a good addition for those of us who want an easier and more fun game. Just wish it didn't involve removing cards from the decks.

## 30 [Goldenfoon on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795688)

I am a big fan of options, and I think this is a great one.

Having just gotten into this game and having a hard time aquiring some of the Mirkwood Cycle my card pool is limited at the moment. So when I sit down to play "Return to Mirkwood" solo this allows me to remove some of the "game ending draws" and allows me to enjoy the Adventure Pack while I build up my card collection.

This might be the best part of this whole easy mode. It lets FFG make quests of any difficulty, really, and then provide clear ways to adapt them. So everyone, to a certain extent, gets their cake and its it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 32 [scottindeed on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795740)

I will admit that LotR has been in a box in the wardrobe for quite some time now.  I stopped after the Dwarrôwdelf cycle and even then I never played the last pack.

i love themed decks, playing the same deck through a whole cycle, but the game really demands tailor made decks for each scenario, all with thematically mismatched "power" cards mixed together to have a sporting chance at victory.

The result is that I spent most of the time with all the cards spread across the floor trying to build decent decks.  I know some people enjoy deck building.  I find it a chore.

im quite excited at giving Easy mode a go with a themed deck again.  Time to rally Legolas and the Wood Eles once more!

## 33 [Gunny_J on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795761)

I agree that this is a well-deserved option for the players of this game.  I am so thankful for this update from the designers.  I can't tell you how many times my frustration level was sky high, embarrassingly so, and tossing cards on the table became a real option.  I do appreciate the challenge of the game, and I plan on doing each scenario in standard mode, at least.  With that said, sometimes I just want to play and have a **** good time with my son or friends, in a more relaxing way.  For new players, this is a godsend!  The timing couldn't be more perfect, as I am currently starting a LOTR LCG league at my LGS. 

About the feeling of cheating, I don't think so.  In fact, the rulebook ALWAYS suggested an easier way to play by just not dealing shadow cards for attacking enemies.  Although I never tried that method, the option was always there. 

## 34 [booored on May 16, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=795839)

The problem with "easy" mode is the name itself. There is a physiological effect going on here that the developers didn't take into account. People feel that they are not "really" playing it.. like they are cheating as some have said or that they finish the quest and have no sense of accomplishment. This is a common problem in game design. If you put in levels of difficulty, instantly there is a sigma on the easier modes.
 
That being said, there is defiantly a group of people that need this mode, and I am not talking about people that suck at the game. Many players of this game are not card game players, as this is really a board game that uses cards and many players came from board game community NOT the card game community. I know many people that hate deck building and complain that they need to make a deck all the time and ask "why can I not build a few decks and pull them out and play every now and then?" Also there are the thematic peeps that thrive on making a deck that has a kind of sense on the game world. These people simply can not beat many of the quests. Theme decks are inherently less efficient and building a single lore or single sphere deck for all occasions is not a good idea. yet many people want to do that as well.
 
So this mode is a must have and a welcome addition.. but they should have called it "Story Mode" or "Theme Play" or something.. anything but "Easy" or "you suck at this game" mode, witch is what they basically called it.
 
So good idea, needed.. yes… the name sucks and will stop people from playing it that probably should.

I'm really happy about this. I had become disenchanted with the game and was on the verge of quitting buying new expansions and I've been buying them since the game came out. I love the game, prefer thematic decks and just don't have time to rebuild decks all the time. There was a thread a while back here and one on Board Game Geek with people complaining about the difficulty and this news feels like the company is listening to the players.

That being said, there is defiantly a group of people that need this mode, and I am not talking about people that suck at the game. Many players of this game are not card game players, as this is really a board game that uses cards and many players came from board game community NOT the card game community. I know many people that hate deck building and complain that they need to make a deck all the time and ask "why can I not build a few decks and pull them out and play every now and then?" Also there are the thematic peeps that thrive on making a deck that has a kind of sense on the game world. These people simply can not beat many of the quests. Theme decks are inherently less efficient and building a single lore or single sphere deck for all occasions is not a good idea. yet many people want to do that as well.

Hmmm i think all experinece players who play card games before dont heed that mode. For what? But yes if you play with your kids yes sure why not?

Me and you come from different comunity we use to play before competive card game and this is a hard school. Even one tournament will teach you very quickly how to play and give you motivation or throw you away forever. But here most odf the players is casual. they dont understand the deck building is a also 505 of the game. They dont wont spend time for think. Deck buidling and after strategy how you play your deck. Sure play just for fun and sometimes is doesn work to be succeseful in this game. you must spend your time and make brain work to be able to win most of the quests. Specialy solo.

So easy mode is perfect for them.

Reading through this thread one can't deny that the huge majority of players obviously see a difficulty problem with LotR. Serveral people said that they considered leaving, or actually left because of frustration. Taking into account that most how actually did leave will not post their opinion here (because they are long gone) the problem seems be huge. I am on the verge of leaving myself.

So good news that FFG responded? Well, kind of, but the response was a little weak and a little late, don't you think? They also introduced Nightmare Mode? Are these actually selling? The game already is in nightmare mode if you ask me!

I fully agree here. It's a start, but already includes absolutely undeserved vilification. "Easy mode" (with this redicoulously hard game) is an insult, because it gives people that they are inferior, cheating players. I have the impression that the huge majority of players thinks that the game is to hard, but FFG seems to listen only to a small group of geeks that playtest their quests. Listen to the base instead! Playtest with an average player with an average deck and you will be shocked by the results, I am sure of it! On the long run this game will not survive without the average people. I suggest to make the quests easier out of the box and sell "hard mode" to the players that want an additional challenge.

Seriously? A great concept pops up an people will be complaining about the label?

Personally I´d hope that people are smarter than being out-witted by something called "Story-mode" instead of "Easy-mode".

The concept is great and I don´t see a downside to it. It is optional after all. Might even give it a try in a solo campaign myself, even though I´ve tackled all the quests with my play-partner on standard.

Though I do wonder wether it will be possible to use the quest-logger to differentiate between easy, standard and nightmare? (probably too much trouble involved with that though)

LOL, so you are the one. ;-)

Seriously, I have absolutely no problem with optional nightmare decks and easy mode is a good addition too.

But, what I don't like/understand and consider to be a mistake, is that FFG seems to be focusing and balancing the normal game for the 1% hardcore players. Why not balance the game for the 99% and provide nightmare decks for the geeks?

We wouldn't need an "easy mode" if "normal mode" would be normal.

Played the new scenario in "standard" mode; got served 3 times in a row. Played in easy mode, got really beat up, but I pulled out a victory. I am highly appreciative of this new game rule. Finally, I can play the game and really enjoy every moment of it, knowing that my odds for actually winning are more balanced. I love this new direction.

Is there any case for seeing the divide in player experiences partially from the thematic vs power style of play? What I mean is: I've used some very powerful decks (some dwarf builds etc) and found a lot of scenarios to be easy. But, when I switch to, let's say, a Gondor + encounter deck manipulation style, I usually have a hard time or lose badly. So could it be that some deck types render the game much easier (and Outlands looks like it may be like that as well), whereas others intrisically don't work so well (however thematic)?

Put this way: the game is much harder if you don't play Spirit Glorfindel or a dwarf-rush deck. Agh, feel like I'm waffling now. In any case, good to see FFG doing things everyone likes!

I thought they just "balanced" the game for that 99%… I think FFG is making an good job with this game (except for the erratas), and the simple way they introduced this easy mode is another example.

The "hardcore" players are much, much more than the 1% you say. Just take a look at the Richsabre's Poll- How Many Core Sets Do You Own? [edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=817286] more than a half players have more than 1 Core Set. And that's not counting those "hardcores" with just 1 Core Set, like myself.

Lowering the dificulty will make the game boring, and many of those "hardcore" players may not be willing to spend even more money in this game just to enjoy a "normal" or "nightmare" game.

Frodo's or Bilbo's journey wasn't easy, neither the search for Gollum, or the battle of Pelennor Fields. And Middle Earth heroes were defeated many times. Did they asked any time to Melkor or Sauron "Could you take it easy on us?"?

BTW. What is a hardcore player? One that tries to enjoy a game as it is? One that takes the time to learn how to play and defeat it's trials? One that expects to have a goot time before winning?

This is a good addtion to the game! Now all those “Boromir,” “Bilbo,” and “Pippin," player gets what they need and want! This is super good! I have friend with whom we are candidates to Boromit type power players and I have even more friends who are more Bilbo or Pippin type players, so this opens up a lot playing options to us! http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2296 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2296]

I have been developing a system called Burglar deck that should make the game more easier, but this is more simple way of doing it. I think that I will continue with Smugler decks, when I have a time to do it, as an alternate way of doing it. http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=773130 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=773130]

The system is so much different, you don't remove cards, but you get helpers. In anyway I like this new system and really hope that we will get new versions of old scenarios in sometime in future with these new "gold" icons. It would make the game even more easier to new players to adapt. I allso hope that we will also see more nightmare decks in the future! The new dawn of LOTR lcg is rising!

Yeah, I thought that was a curious omission from the announcement. Based on the existing breakdown, I'd guess the lists for MaO and Lake-town would look something like this:

MaO:

3x Cut Off

2x Wainrider Captain

3x Captured Watchtower

2x Pelennor Fields

1x The Witch-king (just kidding)

--

Lake-town:

3x Esgaroth Wharf

1x Great House

1x The Master's Manor

2x Reckless in His Rage

2x Close to the Flame

This one is particularly difficult to adjust because so many of the nasty encounter cards are locations that provide crucial victory points. Removing them makes it easier to quest and battle Smaug, but may make it harder to amass the necessary VP level at the end of the game.

As I've gotten older I've lost the stigma I used to have about "easy mode". In fact if its a genre of game I know I'm no good at I'll just start in "easy mode" andif that turns out to easy I might try a harder difficulty since in the end the goal is to have fun.
 
I'm just glad they didn't call it "casual mode" because even though I know it means the same thing as "easy mode" I feel dirty when I have to play "casual mode" in a game.
 
As far as "easy mode" in this game. I've found the game to be quite enjoyable at the current level, it is annoying though to draw the first cards off the encounter deck and know immediately that you have lost, especially when it happens multiple times in a row. I'm not sure I will use this mode but I wonder:
 
- Does easy mode make Escape from Dol Guldur possible solo with only some of the player cards available? Just a core set?
 
- Does it make Return to Mirkwood possible solo with just the core set and RtM adventure pack?
 
- Are there any specific quests that people felt were impossible with a Bilbo/Pippin desk that are now possible?

## 53 [Kcall07 on May 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=796223)

I don't think a casual player would feel ashamed playing on easy mode. That's more the perception of how an 'easy mode player' should feel by competitive tournament players. And calling it anything else would lead to more confusion 'Story mode …. Is there more narrative elements in this?' Etc.

Besides beating a quest on easy mode doesn't have to be considered a final victory. Every time you get a new Hero or amazing player card you'll look back and think 'Great! An Eomer Hero! Now I'll go back and tackle that impossible Helm's Deep quest in standard mode.' I know spirit Glorfindel made a lot of the previous quests beatable in solo. That's the great thing about the game, it's always evolving, and having incremental difficulty levels only increases the replay value and longevity of the game.

I think a lot of us probably just don't have the time or desire to study every minutiae of the game and build meta decks to beat specific scenarios. I enjoy building fun, thematic decks and don't really care to buy more than one core set either. Playing solo (one-handed) can be pretty tough against some of the more difficult scenarios. I play only solo one-handed and haven't even attempted even Escape from Dol Guldur yet because of the difficulty. With easy mode rules I finally want to try it now!

## 55 [Gunny_J on May 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=796294)

I don't see how easy mode is a negative in any way.  Players who like the challenge will still play normal mode or nightmare mode.  Players who are part of leagues or getting together for casual play will find easy mode a much more enjoyable time and certainly less stressful.  One of the biggest advantages to this new mode of play is the fact you pretty much can now construct the heroes and player deck that you find enjoyable and have a good chance of success.  I think that is brilliant.

And for those who think easy mode was a bad decision.  Easy mode has been available for awhile now…it's called using the Dwarf-tailored deck.

For the record, I have played the quest, Into Ithilien, 8 straight times with a carefully constructed Gondor deck and haven't sniffed victory yet.  I have beat every quest up until now by the fifth try.  What is going on here? LOL

@SystemIsDown

I thought the exact same thing about Dol-Gulur.  But then I felt like I should at least give it one try just to see what the quest is like but then nver play it again.  So I gave it one try playing solo with a pretty good deck and guess what!!! I won!  It wasnt even super close.  I was like what?? I thought this is supposed to be a hard quest.  But I looked at all the rest of the cards that I didnt get and thought that I didn't get too easy of draws from the encounter deck.  I got A jailer, Ungoleints Spawn, Hummerhorns, 2 Necromancer's reach(1 I cancelled).  So I'd say that I got a pretty even game and I stll won.  Now I have't given it a second try, but it wasn't as bad as I thought.  You should give it a try i think :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Let me know if you want to see the deck.  

@Experienced players at Dol-Goldur quest.  

What do you think about the above?  I am going to give the quest some more tries, but it seemed not that bad.  I put the shadow key on frodo, and I had Strider to keep threat good.  Do some of you find the quest easier with the bigger card pool now?  Or is this quest still super hard and you always have truoble beating it solo?

Honestly I don't see the point.

What I mean is - this isn't FFG adding anything, all they're saying is take out the hardest cards and start with a resource. This isn't exactly an amazing inovation.

We already had an easy mode where they suggested playing without shadow cards.

 

If I had suggested starting with bonus resources (as a fan suggestion) people would have been saying it was cheating… I don't get why people are fooled into thinking this is any different.

(MInd you, I never objected to peopple taking out cards they didn't enjoy anyway - which is essentially what this change suggests).

Exactly my point. To me it looks like FFG has (finally) realised that many people get frustrated by the games difficulty. Now that's a good thing. But what they did in the matter was the absolute minimum. The game itself was left 100% unchanged.

I had hoped they would make the quests easier out of the box and sell "hard mode" to the players that want an additional challenge.

OK, talking background. So you think it’s fluffy that we try a quest 5+ times until we finally make it with heavily modified decks? You think it’s in line with the story that we fail and die so many times while just encountering a fraction of the challenges the heroes of middle earth actually mastered all the first time (in a row)?

Aragorn: „ Hey Lego, you are no big help here, I think we should replace you with a good quester!“.

This is actually the reason I play with general purpose decks only. The heroes have to deal with whatever is coming using what they have. To use your diction, the heroes can’t ask Melkor or Sauron „Hey wait, can we please change our equipment, get Elrond and Glorfindel and find some unexpected courage etc. before we start over with this battle we cannot otherwise win“?

You can win this battle, but only if you try an get prepared for it. Any avtivity requires time to learn and master it, even those that don't require deckbuilding, or a table. And is pretty hard to eat a soup with a fork.

I played the first two Core quests with a themed 'Bilbo and The Elves' deck on Easy mode  Now I know these quests are not exactly hard to begin with, but I had the most fun playing the game in a long time.  Being able to play with Silvans (my favourite), which currently have little synergy going on, along with themed cards for each of the Heroes (Bilbo, Aragorn and Legolas) made for a fun time.

I used to try this quest every five or six months with the new cards, just to see if it could be completed. And I have never yet done so. Which is a shame, as I like some of the cards that come out of the encounter deck (which is weird, I know). I'd like to have a chance, though, and I think this might just be that chance, now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

OK, talking background. So you think it’s fluffy that we try a quest 5+ times until we finally make it with heavily modified decks? You think it’s in line with the story that we fail and die so many times while just encountering a fraction of the challenges the heroes of middle earth actually mastered all the first time (in a row)? I don’t like the idea that my party (e.g. Legolas, Aragorn and Gimli) got killed by that monster (again…) and now ponder about what equipment or allies they should have brought instead. Aragorn: „ Hey Lego, you are no big help here, I think we should replace you with a good quester!“.

This is actually the reason I play with general purpose decks only. The heroes have to deal with whatever is coming using what they have. To use your diction, the heroes can’t ask Melkor or Sauron „Hey wait, can we please change our equipment, get Elrond and Glorfindel and find some unexpected courage etc. before we start over with this battle we cannot otherwise win“?



The idea of this game is build up the deck and play. if you dont wont to building a deck and really think there is no way to win. So you want everythink easy cose you won win all the time  and dont wont bother yourself tot much? is mean you not really good byer of this game and you are not real custoner for FFG Now you have easy mode so be happy. Main stream of the game should be on the same level for sure! otherwise the game will go down by sells. why? i can ecxplain you but really lazy to type a lot……… shortly: players who is really spend time with this game and buy all cards and packs need a challenge. if there is no challence people will play other game. no one will buy all pack if he play just for fun. to spend money on this game you must love.

Honestly I don't see the point.

What I mean is - this isn't FFG adding anything, all they're saying is take out the hardest cards and start with a resource. This isn't exactly an amazing inovation.

We already had an easy mode where they suggested playing without shadow cards.

 

If I had suggested starting with bonus resources (as a fan suggestion) people would have been saying it was cheating… I don't get why people are fooled into thinking this is any different.

(MInd you, I never objected to peopple taking out cards they didn't enjoy anyway - which is essentially what this change suggests).

Easy mode is nice, but no, I don't think the "old story" is solved unless the standard game manages to provide a better balance between challenge, fun and success for the average casual people. At the moment LotR is (very much to my sadness) frustrating and scaring away old players and having a hard job attracting new ones.

This has been my observation. Fine if it works for you.

Having tried a couple of easy games after a long hiatus (that wasn't difficulty-related; I just pursued other interests for a while and happened to come back to LoTR the same week they announced easy + the new saga expansions), I must say the biggest difference isn't in the cards that are removed from the encounter deck, but rather the extra resources at the beginning. The game has always been so that the first few turns (especially the first one) are critical; having double the resources to start with means more allies right at the start and a much easier pace for the player. Later in the quest, easy or normal makes littles to no difference (in most quests, you get to this point where you almost cannot lose; it's just a matter of score by then).

## 71 [Noccus on May 18, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=796697)

Man I see so much people talk as if their opinion means something in this threat. It's quite entertaining really; so here's mine:

 

At the end of the day, nobody cares if you played hard, standard or easy mode. You play solo, or with friends the way YOU want, in YOUR house.

You can cheat and win all you like at your table anyhow, and even lie and brag here on this forum you beat whatever quest on nightmare mode with 2 threat left. Whoopdidoo, you did not beat anybody but a faceless deck: This is not PvP but PvE. That's a fact.

The point is to have fun no?. Why worry and fight about difficulty? (or even the name of a mode!?) Let others have their opinion & play their game & have fun however they like. Do respect others preferences please, be it themed decks or hardcore.

 

…That said, I hereby like to thank FFG for taking this game we all play onto the next level! Easy mode + Campain mode = extra options = always a bonus for everyone!

But since I take no joy in beeing called a shallow-brained, oafish player and a bad customer I'll leave it at that.

I think standard games are already there.
Barring Print on Demands (which is clearly not meant for casual play), Last adventure pack of cycle (which should be above average challenge because it is finale), and Delux Expansions (which I think have higher difficulty on purpose so people would want/need to have player cards from relative cycle), the game isn't really that difficult.

The Saga expansions are especially well designed that I see many people saying they have gotten Core Set + Saga Expansions and are having good time.

I definitely don't want every scenario to be as difficult as Laketown or Dol Guldur, but I would hate to see every quest being as easy as Passage through Mirkwood. If a new expansion is 'fun and sucess' for player who builds thematic decks from limited card pool, what would it be like for people who are into deck-building and has all the card pool?

Now that there are Easy Mode (that doesn't need anything extra) for casual players and Nightmare Mode soon to be available for those people who are willing to spend few extra dollars for added dificulty, I think Standard Mode should keep the trend it has; initially difficult Delux Expansion (so people can have fun losing while waiting for Cycle to properly launch), relatively easier first 5 AP with gradual increase in difficulty (so we can go through them once a month) then relatively difficult final chapter (so we can have fun losing while waiting for next Delux expansion) while increasing difficulty between Cycles to keep up with the powercreep of Player cards.

 Game is grow and more and more players play it now. And with easy mode casual players will be more happy. I tell you people who really spend money is not casual players. I have discuss with many players ans most of the plyers who complain about the game difficulty have only 1 set and couple of packs they dont have much time ot play game and they stop to play game anyway very shortly. Anyway i think we will not come to any points here with you so i better keep silence. Im here anyway for 2 yers already from the begin and im still here and i do love this game, create community in my city to play this game make a some videos you can see on youtube and im pretty sure the game way now is right way. SInce they create a easy mode diffcult not go down generaly. And if you spend more time with this game your level will go up and you will be also ok.

Yesterday me and my friend play 2 games. first game Dol-Guldor nightmare we lost. Second one Dol-Gudlor NIghtmare we win. OK. so we move to the last quest in HON Cair-Adros. We lost all 3 games. So wi won only 1 game with a good very powerful good decks. So should i right emal to FFG to complain about difficulty?  We have a great fun to try to win. All games was cool was a lot of dangerous decisions and encounter deck give us hell. OS now we get motivation to build up even better decks… this how is works. Struggle is always good. this make you better or you can give up. But all Tolkien book is about it. So how the way to Mordor can be easy? We cannot touch main stream of the game. Easy mode is a good solution.

If i insult you somehow sorry.

You're superficially correct, but I think there is a material difference between voluntarily adding/removing encounter cards to adjust difficulty and doing so according to officially sanctioned guidlines published by FFG. You're right that it's not an "amazing innovation," but it is important. Prior to this announcment, altering the encounter deck of one's own accord resided in the same psychologically uncomfortable zone as the classic "let's just ignore that encounter card and reveal another one" play. It was formally cheating. Some players were certainly fine with that, but I know many others didn't want to "cheat" in order to enjoy the game. 

Now that Easy Mode exists, that self-imposed stigma no longer needs to apply. Players can adjust the difficulty to suit their tastes without feeling as if they are circumventing the official rules. Additionally, the Easy Mode document provides a level of standardization that was previously absent. All of this results in a less challenging game experience but one that retains an important degree of legitimacy. It's one thing to make up your own rules; it's another thing entirely for the publisher to say, "Here's another way to play our game. You can play this way and it's totally fine. You aren't cheating." That means a lot to many players.

I say this as a very experienced LotR player who will probably never use the Easy Mode variant: it is a fantastic and necessary addition to the game. It will only help bring jilted players back into the fold by providing them with a new way to play--and, hopefully, succeed--without feeling as though they are breaking the rules. The official blessing from FFG is significant in and of itself.

This is allso my view of things. This game can become really borong if it is too easy. You like to play nightmare version and it suit nicely to you. I normally play normal version and I am guite happy with them. I know that I could have even better succes with a little bit more Boromir like deck building, but there is a little pard of Pippin and Bilbo player in me, so normal difficulty seems to be the best for me. And now easy mode make the life of any casual and Pippin / Bilbo players much easier. Like someone above said the extra resource in the beginning is very powerfull ability. It does not brake the game and the story reamains relatively same. If it feels too easy, maybe take only that starting resource and give it a try. In anyway I am guite happy to see an "official" solution to different difficulties (levels) to this game. It is a guite common way of solwing problems in coop games. Pandemia has diffuculty levels, Sinking Island have them, The Nazgul board game has them. Nice to see them in this game too!

Started playing this game a month 1/2 ago. I only owned 1 core set till this week when my store received my order for The Hunt for Gollum, Conflick at the Carrock & The Hills of Emyn Muil. Will get A Journey to Rhosgobel tomorrow. I only played solo so far and you can say I'm a bad deck builder. I had already beaten Passage Through Mirkwood.

I tried the game on easy mode and had no difficulties beating Passage again. Couldn't beat Journey along the Anduin with my leadership/spirit deck so switched to tactics/spirit and got it in my first try. Then tried Escape from Dol Guldur………! is it possible to defeat that stage in solo??? the 3 objectives had a total of 6 menace before my first turn…

So far I like easy mode and quest that I managed to defeat in easy mode I will try later in normal mode.

Exactly! I actually didn't mind the difficulty of scenarios per se, but rather how they achieve to amp up the difficulty. Basically adding cards saying 'You are f***ed. You lose the game.' simply isn't fun.

With easy mode this part of the problem is addressed. But I cannot shake the feeling it's 'too little, too late'. Everyone I know who had been playing the game has already stopped and sold their collection. The vocal-minority Glaurung faction has already taken over.

Myself, I was tempted to stop buying more cards after 'The Shadow & Flame' but was able to win after building two decks specifically to beat it. But I'm simply not interested in building decks specifically suited for a single scenario. The deck-building part of the game is simply not the fun part of the game for me, particularly since building such a deck takes longer than playing the actual scenario.

Then I hit the next brick wall with the 'Ithilien' scenario from the Numenor box. I never even got past the first stage, deck-building or no. Today, I replayed it on 'Easy'-mode and managed to get to the 4th stage in my second game. I still didn't win but after reading this thread I noticed that I forgot about the double starting resources… But now, for the first time, the scenario seems managable.

Still, I'm wondering if the game shouldn't best be viewed as a failed experiment. Is an LCG really the best format for this kind of game? I'm more and more inclined to think that a 'standard' game game with fixed player cards and scenarios that are play-tested to offer a moderate challenge for these standard decks would have been better.

I'm still on the fence if I really want to invest more money in this game.

I don't think this LCG is a failed expereiment. I really like how this game can expand, yet still allow for deckbuilding, and the easy mode makes some more Pippin-like decks succeed for the harder scenarios. I also really don't like making a deck just to beat a scenario, because I really like to build a deck based on theme and synergy, not playing the metagame. 

I still have faith in this format, but you are of course right in your opnion! I do understand that there are some in this community that will make you feel bad, but they really have no right to belittle people's views. Shame on those people! I'm sure things will be all right in the end, though.

(however, if a fixed deck thing is more your wheelhouse and you like superheroes, then Sentinels of the Multiverse is a good co-op)

I agree with much of what jhaelen said. The game isn't "hard".. but it relies on random game over card effects. Effects that have nothing to do with skill or deck building… it is just the luck of the draw. I have only recently come back as the nightmare packs really interest me… but I stopped playing because I found it frustrating that my time and effort in deck building was meaningless. .. well in some cases. So for me it is not about difficultly.. as the game isn't "difficult" it is just that at any turn you can die instantly.

There is just NO way that a analogue AI like a dummy draw deck can deal with a human deck builder.. there is just no way.. (though Kingdom Death's AI cards are giving it a real try!) So once the pool gets larger and people start making powerful decks and get used to the quest, there is really NO WAY you can loose. The only way around this is to put in a mechanism called "setback".. it is used in many games that require dummy decks. Random draws that are pure luck and can greatly effect the player position. Sure there are cards that can help if you have them in hand, but even that was not enough and now there are many cards with effects that can not be canceled, you draw it you die. Put simply it is a bad game design period.

Now the game is a fun game, and some people do not mind the randomness off it. I enjoy it a lot, and play it now and then but I like to feel that I can make strategic decisions about my deck and the way I play it.. in this game it is simply not like that. You make a good deck and it snowballs into unstoppable power, or you hit the setbacks and limp over the line or more recently loose. There is no deck, or skill that can get past this… this game is more like Black Jack than a CCG.

Can it be fun? Sure.. winning is not the point of a game, as Glaurung's Dol Gol Dur story shows, it can still be fun, a lot of fun. I have fun playing it. This fact though dose not remove the point that there is a fundamentally bad game design at the very core of this game that will always cause threads about difficulty, house rule fixes, rage threads.. etc etc. It has been like that form day 1.. and it will never change.. and you know why? Because the game itself is flawed.

It seems that most complainers miss some important characteristics of this game:

 1. Cards are dealt randomly. Which means games are unpredictable. Which means players must evaluate their decisions' risks to succes. Luck is a part of this game and sometimes it will favour the players, and sometimes the Encounter deck. But that's only a part of the game, skilled players adapt to those risks to minimize their impact. Only less skilled "players" see this game like a lotery.
 2. It's hard because it has to be. There's no human oponent to adapt to the player. There's no interest in effortless wining: there's no replay value because you'll beat the game again. No effort = no fun.
 3. It's a game, not a story. Should it be based on Dungeons and Dragons or some other similar franchise, people wouldn't complain on the "narrative aspects".

Those people should try videogames, where stuff is less random and much more casual-friendly. Or those books that develop depending on reader decissions going from page to page. I don't understand why they wan't to break this game. They should have learned how this game works (yes, invest time on it) right when they bought the Core Set and think how they liked it, instead of investing their money on more expansions just because it's based on a theme they like.

But that's only a part of the game, skilled players adapt to those risks to minimize their impact. Only less skilled "players" see this game like a lotery.
 2. It's hard because it has to be. There's no human oponent to adapt to the player. There's no interest in effortless wining: there's no replay value because you'll beat the game again. No effort = no fun.
 3. It's a game, not a story. Should it be based on Dungeons and Dragons or some other similar franchise, people wouldn't complain on the "narrative aspects".

Those people should try videogames, where stuff is less random and much more casual-friendly. Or those books that develop depending on reader decissions going from page to page. I don't understand why they wan't to break this game. They should have learned how this game works (yes, invest time on it) right when they bought the Core Set and think how they liked it, instead of investing their money on more expansions just because it's based on a theme they like.

 

 

Nice post, Karagh; you've articulated what I've been thinking a lot about lately - that this game has a very divergent fan base.

Everyone I know who plays this game likes LOTR but would also think of themselves as a somewhat serious gamer (or, at least, not casual). I don't know anyone at my local game store who simply plays the game for the "theme," has no interest in deck building, tweaking decks for each quest, etc. We all come from a background of playing other LCGs/CCGs, so it's sort of a natural evolution to this game.

On the Forums, however, there seem to be a large contingent of "casual" players with less interest in deck building, outside of theme decks, and want to play for the story.

But, I think you are right - if narrative is what you are after, there are perhaps better venues (RPGs, video games, board games, etc) as opposed to a card game - which never seem to tell a story all too well (though, certianly, some succeed better than others). Additionally, theme decks in many games are never nearly as powerful as carefully constructed decks are. That's not to say they never work, but LOTR:LCG is so young in it's life cylce (we don't really get all that many new player cards per year, for example) that there hasn't been time to develop the themes for many major races in Middle Earth.

Given that this is a living game, and we keep getting better and better player cards, I don't think the quests should be getting "easier;" rather, they do need to keep pace with the power of the player cards (power creep is laregely unavoidable in any LCG/CCG). It really isn't all that fun to play a game that you know before you ever sit down that you are going to win. The fun of games is the chance of losing.

Even still, Easy/Narrative Mode is a good fix for those looking for something different out of this game and I welcome it whole-heartedly, even if I'll probably never use it, as I seek out the challenge. Some are just a glutton for punishment, I guess. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I may be wrong here, but I would bet that a lot of the casual players who seek a easier/more thematic game are like myself, solo players. For a game that is pushed as being for 1 to 4 players, solo play is incredibly hard a lot of the time. Rather than come up with an easy mode, though a good idea, would be for FFG to sort out a solo player mode that doesn't involve removing cards. We want a reasonable challenge not a walk over I'm sure.

Pressuring FFG for harder and harder isn't helping the casual player side of the market. I'm sure that a lot of us picked this game up because of the supposed accessibility for solo play.

What's funny about this statement is that I tried the "easy" mode for Into Ithilien a couple times after not being to complete it after about 12 attempts.  So, I remove the cards and it almost removed half the deck - literally.  My thinking was that we shouldn't be eliminating cards, we should be "adding" some softer cards to give casual players a breather and reduce the probability of drawing f-you cards constantly.  Anyway, I still did not defeat Into Ithilien on easy, so I just reconstructed my deck, put all the cards back in the deck, and then beat it on my sixth attempt with the new deck.  Regardless, I think adding easy mode cards would be better than eliminating anything.  Probably too late now, but its too bad they could release an easy card pack and we can just include those into decks.

A set of generic "easy" cards that could be put into encounter decks would actually be a nice idea. Still possible as a POD product but would need some serious work to make sure they were worth while.

I don't get it when people say game isn't hard but just have few random 'you lose' cards.
Making decisions to prepare and overcome those 'you lose' cards is the challenge of the game.

If you have a feint or test of will in hand, you hang on to your resource instead of spending it on an ally or attachments so you can actually play those events whenever needed.
If you know a direct damage to defender shadow cards are out there (like blocking wargs shadow), you don't block with whimpy allies unless your hero can tank unexpected undefended attacks.
When there is direct damaging trechery cards (like swarming insects), save your 1hp healer ally until those trecheries are discarded or when you absolutely need healing.
You don't quest with heroes only when there is a sudden pitfall in encounter deck, you take few threats until you've got an ally out.

It is true that there are few scenarios that does require tailored deck and reasonable luck for consistent victory (looking at you rhosgobel), but some scenarios are more about how you play than luck or deck building (especially true for osgiliath or ithilien where every decision does matter).
Obviously lucky draws mean better score, but good tactics could change lost cause into a victory.

The thing is: I've played exactly 199 games so far and up until 'Shadow and Flame' I was able to beat every scenario without having to deckbuild. That is, I basically created four mono-sphere decks by including a copy of (almost) every card for a sphere, doubling some of the allies cards until I had about 30 allies in the deck. I then picked three heroes for each deck and tried to beat a scenario with different combinations of decks. Sometimes I won 5 of 6 games, sometimes only 1 in 6. But I always felt that I had a chance - even in the Battle of Lake Town POD scenario.

This first changed with 'Shadow and Flame'. It was the first scenario I built decks specifically to beat it. And this was also when I first thought of stopping to invest in the game.

Now, enter the Numenor set. I still managed to beat the first scenario using the (slightly modified) decks I had used to beat 'Shadow and Flame', but in the Ithilien scenario I didn't even make any kind of progress in the first stage. And worse, I didn't really have any good idea how to change the decks to beat it.

As far as I know, the Numenor set wasn't advertised as 'only Pro's need apply'. There was no way for me to tell in advance it would be so friggin hard. Even the difficulty ratings given offer no hint (difficulty 4 for Ithilien?! Who do they think they're kidding? I'd say it's about a nine).

And to give an example what I hate about the scenario: Some of the worst effects in the story deck are 'Forced:' effects instead of 'When Revealed'. Likewise some locations are 'immune to player card effects'. Or a shadow card effect that 'cannnot be canceled'.

So basically, the designers are giving us cards to deal with effects and then design the story cards so that these cards are useless. Imho, this is a big no, no.

Now, with Easy Mode I've finally beaten the Ithilien scenario in my third attempt and it was very, very close, even though I played it very, very safe. Basically, exactly how I like my difficulty. Some of the 'screw you' cards are still in the story deck, but there are fewer, so you can better plan for them.

We'll see how I fare in the third scenario. I'll first try in in standard mode, of course, but I'm not optimistic.

What I've been wondering is this: Aren't the cards for an entire cycle designed at the same time? If so, I have a feeling, the player cards required to beat the scenarios of the cycle started with the Numenor box reliably will only be available after the cycle is complete. Thinking back to the Khazad-Dum cycle, wasn't it exactly like that? The until-recently-dominant dwarf decks grew in power with each new AP released. If so, maybe I should just shelf the Numenor box and wait until the cycle is complete and play them then with decks built around the new cards.

TL;DR: What I'm looking for are scenarios that you have a chance to win with an all-purpose deck, even if it takes several (say up to six ^^) tries. Even better would be scenarios that can be beaten using different strategies (i.e. spheres). That's actually what I had been hoping for in the beginning: Scenarios that play differently depending on your choice of spheres. I did not look for a game that revolves around finding the one deck that is the only way to win a scenario.

Yes, all of the cards for a cycle are designed and playtested at once.

I've never had to really, specifically deck build for a quest, with the exception of adding healing to Rhosgobel. Shadow and Flame was simply "chump block for the win." (meaning, never completely destroy a deck and only include cards I think would apply only to a given scenario - but i do add and take away lots of different things dependent on Battle/Siege/WP questing, etc.)

HoN is certainly more difficult, but other than knowing I needed to Battle and Siege quest (and therefore include heroes and allies that are good at that) I didn't deck build for it specifically and was able to win all of the quests.

As for the Forced effects that cannot be cancelled, I think that's a good thing. If every effect was easily negated, the encounter deck has little to no chance against a human player. Some of the negative effects must be able to go off, I think. So, IMHO, it's a good thing to have cards immune to certain player effects. Now, if every encounter card was, that'd be a bit extreme - but it's usually only a handful and that's fine by me. You have to think outside the box for how you want to approach that particular adventure.

At the end of the day, this is a card game. And every card game of this genre, dating back to Magic: The Gathering, requires deck building. Whether it's figuring out how to beat the stellar deck your buddy trounces you with or how to master the encounter deck, you have to be willing to put in the effort to tweak a deck to succeed. This is what card games are about, and have always been about (again, meaning the CCG/TCG/LCG variety - not things like Old Maid or Uno).

I struggle to understand the resistance by some players of this game to building decks for what is essentially an entirely new game/situation presented to us with each Quest. This isn't a board game. It's not a video game. Card games are all about, and always have been about, adapting to different challenges as the card pool grows - whether it's a competitive or co-op game. The very name "living" tells you the game will grow and change, requiring players to do the same. It's simply not enough to slap the latest cards into a deck and expect that to be successful.

To echo what another poster said, it seems like there is a contingent that plays this game not because they enjoy the aspects inherent in any LCG/CCG but simply because they like the theme - and that will always, it seems to me, lead to frustration.

Good post!

I definitely got into the game because of the theme and it's the main reason I _want_ to like the game. And at least initially it did meet my expectations but now it seems it's time for me to move on. Hence, it's a failed experiment for me.

I think peoples points though are that it dosn't matter how you deck build or play.. a unlucky draw will cripple you. This can not be modified with skill. It is pure luck. You can nto "overcome" it.. you just have to either weaken your deck to put a answer to it, and then happen to have it drawn when the card is drawn, or more often is the case, ignore it make your deck stronger (as in have a higher win ratio) and just hope it is not drawn.

How many 'game over' cards exist in the game? None.

The two cards which most closely resemble this are Sudden Pitfall and Sleeping Sentry.

Sudden Pitfall can be avoided by getting a cheap ally out and questing with them each turn.

Sleeping Sentry appears in one quest. It can be countered with Balin, Elenor, or any of the spirit cancelling cards.

Both of these cards only appeared in the Khazad Dum and Dwarrowdelf era. The designers have listened to people's feedback and not included any cards like this in subsequent quests.

Besides these cards can actually be quite fun - the tension of taking a shadow effect you know you can't block, or having an easy victory snatched from you at the last minute only to claw it back with your one, heavily wounded, remaining hero. 

To call the game flawed, luck based, and saying no skill is involved in playing it because of these two cards is ludicrous.

There now exists easy mode (which omits these cards) standard mode and nightmare mode so everyone can play the game however they want. I don't see what there is left to complain about concerning difficulty.

## 97 [Style75 on May 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83873-easy-mode/?do=findComment&comment=798398)

I've been tinkering with another version of easy mode that doesn't require the removal of cards from the encounter deck (with the exception of course of BS you lose cards like Sleeping Sentry). You start the game with bonus resources like the official "Easy Mode" but also with two extra cards in the starting hand (now a total of 8 cards). I've been amazed at how powerful this simple change can be. Usually on the first turn I can get out some allies and attachments and I'm very well set up for whatever comes off the encounter deck. It's a little tougher than official easy mode but a little easier than normal mode. Here's how I see it now in my head:

Easiest

1. Easy

2. Revised Easy (described above)

3. Standard

4. Nightmare

Hardest

With these options I can easily pick which difficulty I want to play and have a satisfying game. For the record, last night I got a friend of mine who's never played before and we played Seige of Cair Andros on easy mode. I had two decks built, one outlands (the deck my friend used) and the other gondor based. Although we still didn't win, the game never felt overwhelming and victory always felt possible. He had a great time and is eager to play again. Based on this experience, I think easy mode is a definite success. Thank you FFG!

I agree unlucky draw will be crippling.
Turn 1 Attercop or Mumakil or something like that will always make your game tougher and as result make your score worse.
If that's what people are saying, then I agree with them and I guess I misunderstood.

But I thought they were saying there are cards that will 'auto lose' the game for you if drawn and there was nothing you could do to stop it?
So far I have yet to encounter a card that was 'auto lose'.

While there are some cases when encounter deck is stacked to a point where you will lose no matter what you do,
but more often then not had you done something differently 2~3 turns ago in anticipation of worst case scenario with each card flip, you would've been able to survive that encounter and therefore 'overcome' it. I have yet to see an encounter card that cannot be mitigated by clever plays (let alone deck build).

Then again, this is what the easy mode is for; if you feel like some cards are unfair and is 'automatic lose', you can simply take them out now with official variant.

Booored…there are ppl that say the game is bad, you seem to, in fact, suggest the very thing:

"this fact though dose [sic] not remove the point that there is a fundamentally bad game design at the very core of this game"

you yourself said the game is fundamentally flawed - being flawed isn't a "good" thing - certainly being fundamentally flawed is even worse. you could interpret your comment to mean the game is "bad" (at least on some level).

even still, there are plenty of people that *do* say this game is bad, unfun, or too hard - a decent number of ppl in this thread have suggested these very things.

so, at least to me, you are misinterpreting what many others have been saying, not the other way around.

Let me give an example:

Well, at least in the Ithilien scenario you start out with enemies (one for each player) dealing 5 base damage. Shadow cards will add up to 3 additional damage to that (up to 4 in a four player game). There's also a shadow effect dealing 1 damage to the defender that cannot be soaked. In addition there's both an enemy that gets an extra attack from the staging area and a shadow effect granting an additional attack.

Effectively this means you cannot ever dare to defend with a hero (except Frodo or - once - Beorn) or an ally with only 1 hit point. So you either must have two allies that can soak 2 damage in reserve or a cards that allow you to prevent an enemy from attacking.

The majority of cards in the deck are enemies and almost all of the Treachery cards have surge which usually means you need to have a second defender ready.

And because the Path to Ithilien is the active location, all of these enemies will attack right away, unless you quest successfully and can accumulate at least four tokens. And this is frankly a gamble and will require luck.

If one of your heroes is killed in this initial assault you might as well start over. It may not be an instant game over, but you'll lose nonetheless. You can draw out the game but you will never win it.

In my nine games this only worked in two of the three easy-mode games and in none of the 'normal difficulty' ones.

Clawing your way back to win with a single hero can only work late in the game after you've already assembled a sizeable band of allies.

 

Alright, and now I'm ready for the flood of replies telling me how I'm totally wrong, not skilled enough and have been using crap decks. Shoot away! sonreir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sonreir.gif]

Not at all, you're quite right. However I think it's best to see Into Ithillien as something of an anomaly. There was a long thread when it came out suggesting its difficulty was an oversight by the developers, and a correction has been made since to blocking wargs in the FAQ.

The quest before and after are far better balanced. Me and my play partner were quite surprised when we got to Cair Andros and beat it in a couple of tries (with our excruciatingly honed decks from Ithillien.) I have a feeling the variable difficulties in this cycle will be much more manageable. And from the looks of the previews we'll be getting some great new player cards which will make dispatching the Mumakil all the easier.

That is, until the nightmare version comes out. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

TragicTheBlathering said:

I think it is an anomaly, it's definitely a lot harder than the designers thought. (Since they say it's a 4?!) I think they thought it was an easy scenario and that therefore HoN wasn't that bad (one easy, one medium, one hard) but actually Into Ithilian is so hard that Cair Andros ends up being the medium.

 

Which means that instead of getting a 4 and 6 and an 8 (the 6 and and 8 are from memory), we got a 6 an 8 and a 10.

 

This is an anomolgy because generaly speaking the "easy" quests (4's and the like) haven't been very challanging at all,but this time it clearly is. 

Personally I think the difficulties concept should be scrapped though, they're not very accurate (although into Ithilien is clearly the least accurate).
