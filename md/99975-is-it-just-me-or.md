They could have created a trechery attachment cards instead of creaing those messy and hard to refer descriptions like "counts as Conditon attachment with text bla bla bla"?

I can understand this decision on something like bats which then become attachment to someone damaged by them, but trecheries...

 

It could be as simple as player attachment, and it'll be a lot easier to read:

 

Example from the core set:

 

Caught in the Web

Attachment. Condition.

When Revealed: Attach to a hero controlled by the player with highest threat level.

 

Attached hero does not ready during the refresh phase unless you pay 2 resources from that hero's pool.

 

 

 

Yes, it's minor and it's just usability, but hey - why not?

It has to be a condition so that Miner of the Iron Hills can remove it. Otherwise I totally agree with you.

Oh yeah, I missed that bit in the middle. In that case I agree 99,9* percent with you. Well, but I'm at war with LCG rules, so I'm probably not the best choice.

they are probably left as treacheries so that treachery cancellation can cancel them, if able. having a 4th type of encounter card would just necessitate another type of removal/cancellation.

I mean that most of the times I interpret these rules, if they're ambigious, differently than they're handled by the designers. That's because I like to use common sense to interpret a rule.

 

 

I guess what mndela means is that your suggestion lacks the "when revealed" keyword and the fact that Eleanor is not able to cancel treachery attachment cards (which is because they don't exist).

## 10 [KennedyHawk2 on February 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99975-is-it-just-me-or/?do=findComment&comment=994309)

I don't see how the text is confusing as is. It's a round about description but it keeps the encounter deck to three types of cards.

No, he is not, because in my "variant", attachment is just a trait of trechery and trechery is still a trechery for all game purposes. If you'll read my suggestion, you'll even find the "When Revealed" wording which is used for test of will, Eleanor and etc.

 

To further prove my point, I'll add rough implementation of what I have suggested(yeah, I missed the "cannot be canceled part)":

WSdzkF0wHeI.jpg [http://cs313921.vk.me/v313921009/8a53/WSdzkF0wHeI.jpg]

 

See? It's still a treachery, it can be interacted as a trachery by all existing means, and it's not a bloody mess of hard-navigable text, easy to read and clear to understand.

But this isn't any simpler than the original card, it just out right states the traits.

 

I see no way to interpret the card differently as is, why change it?

ah, your original post was unclear then (at least to me).

 

i see what you are saying, but it's probably not going to happen (the designers are going to want to keep card layout/language consistent to previous cards doing similar things). it would play fine either way for me.

It is simplies because it looks like an actual attachment and you don't need to search middtext to find it's effects and traits if you need to.

 

Dain, I'm not saying they will or it is going to happen, I'm just wasking why wasnt it that way from the very beginning?

It always amazes me at how much effort it takes to create a really good design space.  Game mechanics, with enough play testing and experience, probably fall together pretty easily by comparison.  But, having the forethought to anticipate where the game could go over the course of its years of life, that is a tough gig.

 

In hindsight, I'm sure Nate may consider this change. But, at the time he created the LotR design space, he thought it was the best approach going forward.

I don't think it's going to be good - changing the encounter attachments now, when everyone is used to old ones. I just fail to understand - why it was so hard to do then, when game started? It's not so hard to come by, if somebody like me came up with it.

## 18 [danpoage on February 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99975-is-it-just-me-or/?do=findComment&comment=994402)

I will add that the reason they add the "counts as a Condition attachment with the text..." is because when a card changes type (e.g. from a Treachery to an Attachment) it loses all of its old game text, unless the card effect specifically says otherwise. This means that after Caught in a Web becomes an attachment, all it has is the trait "Condition" and the text "Attached hero does not ready during the refresh phase...". All of the LCGs work the same in this regard. Nate French came up with this pattern long before Lord of the Rings: The Card Game ever existed so it was logical that they would reuse it in this game.

 

I agree with your initial opinion, by the way, the template that they use for these type of effects is overly verbose. It is worth pointing out that, in the case of Lord of the Rings, this decision was not made arbitrarily as the basic LCG rules framework had already been established. To be honest, if we're going to talk about issues with the rules of this game, Treachery Attachments are low on my list of complaints. As just one example: Framework effects vs. Targeted player card effects (Quick Strike vs. Hands Upon the Bow) is so much messier and less intuitive. I have never once had a problem understanding Treachery Attachments, so although they are wordy, at least they are intuitive enough to get right on the first try.

I think the original idea was about Caught in web and Miner of Iron hills. The text of Caught in the Web able the hability of Miner of Iron Hills, if not, the hability of dwarfs is totally useless.

If you don't say the card becomes a Condition attachment...., there is a problem

 

PD: Lotr-LCG is my first game of cards. When i started i wondered why the reason about a lot of many texts, and during along the time, i was understanding some of answers. Each word have a reason to be in his place.

You're partially right.



> If you don't say the card becomes a Condition attachment...., there is a problem

This is the issue with the idea that MyNeighbourTrololo came up with: Attachment is a card type, not a trait. So either the encounter cards need a new Attachment card type, or it needs to transform from a Treachery to an Attachment, as it currently does. If we give them an attachment card type, then Eleanor doesn't work to stop them because she explicitly targets treacheries. I totally understand the disgust for the long complicated card text of transforming a Treachery to an attachment, but I like keeping the number of card types small, too. I could go either way.

danpoage, my complaint is about clearness of card text. In current state it's very hard to nagivate and read.

> joezim007, would they do like I suggested from the very beginning - there'll be no problem.



Why not? Just because they've done it from the beginning, doesn't mean it's an attachment. I guess you might mean that you could have the cards (like Miner of the Iron Hills) say "choose and discard 1 Condition card from play." instead of specifying attachment, but mechanically, it seems better that cards that get attached should be attachments.

 

My point is that they should either go beyond what you are doing and make the encounter cards be of the attachment type - instead of transforming from a treachery to an attachment - or do what they are already doing. I don't feel like your solution works because attachment is a card type, not a trait.

My "solution" is for card text readability, stop dragging rules into this. 

 

And if you will, here's an easy solution to everything:

In the card type box, add a sub-type "attachment". So, simple treacheries are treacheries and treacheries with attachment effect are "Attachment Treacheries" by type. 

 

And a simple rule: While Attachment Treachery card is being revealed it's treated as trechery, when it get's attached, it stops being treated as trechery and is treated as attachment from now on. As simple as that.

Yes, and I agree with your complaint. I was simply pointing out that the reason for the awkward text is because they had already established this "becomes an attachment" template in previous LCGs.

I think that the current descriptions are more in keeping with the theme/story of this game. So whilst having text that is readily understood is important I do wonder if 'santising' the text, even if it made it easier to understand, might take away from the overall look and feel of the game.

From a game play mechanics point of view, your idea is a slam dunk. 

But, game designers have to think about more than that.  An example is manufacturability and graphics artists cost.

To have space for a sub-type under "treachery" a different card template might be required, which means paying for more graphics time and more time at the printer since there would no longer be a 'generic' treachery template.  In addition, there are ergonomic considerations.  Maybe during early play-testing some folks were confused by the sub-text.  This also gets into the look and feel that chuckles speaks of.

How do you not drag rules into this. You can't make a card that doesn't follow the rules. If making a card more readable breaks the rules, then it doesn't work. I do, however, sorta like this additional bit of solution. Another solution would just be to say "Counts as an attachment" at the end of the When Revealed effect. It's still more readable and doesn't require any sub-types or extra rules.

I understand the need to find a way to include the sub-type in the card design, though I would consider that a minor concern really. The box where the type is contained can just be widened and add " - Attachment" to the end of the card type or something similar. I also wouldn't think that the sub-type would be too confusing during play-testing.

Boom, there you go.

 

1) Has when revealed text for interaction purposes?(Test of Will, Eleanor) -Check.

2) Has attachment type for interaction purposes?(Miner of Iron Hills) -Check

3) Has treachery type for interaction purposes?(Palantir) -Check

4) Has a condition trait interaction purposes?(Miner of Iron Hills again) -Check

 

Simple rule: While it's being revealed - it's a treachery. After it's "When revealed" effect triggers successfully - it stops being treachery and becomes attachment.

I see and agree with the appointed problem, but it's complex. For example, A Test of Will cancels "When Revealed" effects, but it doesn't say what to do with the card after that. In this case we would have a card that should be doing something, but it does nothing because it wasn't attached to anything. And it won't be discarded because is an Attachment. But there may be other problems: Will Eleanor work with this new type of card? How will it work with Palantir? Rules must be solid, and the way these Treachery-Attachments are currently written is solid.

 

Sub-types and co-types' problem is as old as the expandable card games. When Magic the Gathering tried to fix it, they changed the core rules, and the text of hundreds of cards printed before the change.

As I mentioned above - as soon as When Revealed effects triggers(meaning that card attaches to the target), treachery stops being treachery and becomes attachment. IF when revealed effect is prevented from resolving, treachery remains treachery and enters discard pile without being attached. As simple as that. 

 

To put it more simple: Treachery Attachment card is considered a Treachery all times except while it's attached to something. As soon as it stops beaing attached(like discarded by Miner of the Iron Hills), it stops being attachment, becomes treachery again and enters discard pile.

From FAQ

(1.23) Attachments

Any objective card that attaches to another card is

treated as an attachment in addition to its other card

types.

Any non-objective card that attaches to another card

loses its original card type and gains the attachment

card type.

The “Attach to...” rules text on an attachment is only a

play restriction, and is not taken into account after the

card is already attached.

That's why a Treachery doesn't need the Attachment type.

The whole discussion is trivial. It has been addressed and there isn´t anything gained from playing Captain Hindsight: "what they should have done from the beginning..." is too easy when you don´t know how the game is evolving and no matter how covered you think you are rules-wise there will always be holes that needs to be addressed as new things are being added and interact in unforeseen ways.

Well, why don't they made enemies as treacheries which read:

"When Revealed: Put this card into staging area. Counts as enemy with 34 engagement cost, 3 threat, 2 attack, 3 defense, 4 hit points, Spider trait and text: When Revealed: Each player exhausts everything he has".

 

There IS a reason for it. It's called usability.

All cards that are attached gain the attachment type as per the FAQ 1,23.

Therefore adding attachment as a keyword is irrelevant as it is always implied once a card is attached.

Therefore this discussion has no merit.

I never added attachment as a keyword, I added it as a trait initally, but then removed and added attachment as an additional type of card. And no, you didn't, if you keep insisting on nonsense you're posting here.

Keyword or trait... both are irrelevant. A whole new type of card is even more irrelevant because, as has been pointed out earlier, that would require yet another type of counter among the player cards. 

And all I am claiming is that the system is fine as it is and that your suggested alterations have no point.

If that is nonsense then, by extension, you´re claiming that the whole game, as it stands now, is nonsense.

 

On another note: this has dragged on for much longer than it has needed. The whole issue is answered in the FAQ (as has also been pointed out) and ought have stopped by that. Non-attachments become attachments when attached. No matter how they obtained that status. I don´t know how you can keep analyzing on that or cling to a lost cause about adding traits where not needed and/or whole new types of cards.

Ok, I'll play along with you claiming that you had a read of the thread, while you clearly haven't.

 

First of all, it's readability. How well card text is layed out and how easy it's to read and understand. It was never about the rules until people dragged it out.

Second, when people brought up rule confusion which my layout could have brought, I made a fix, and even added a simple rule, as a result preserving current matters and all. Nothing in the game got changed, just encounter attachment would be much easier to read and understand.

Yes, all you're claiming that's system is fine and this is pointless in this thread, because no one tried to change the system. You would know this by now if you would have read the thread. But, once again, you didn't.

 

The rest of your text is irrelevant(oh, who am I kidding, your entire text is irrelevant) because you cleary don't get the entire point of what I have done there.

So your whole argument cannot be boiled down to semantics?

 

Some would argue that if a thing isn´t broken you shouldn´t try to fix it.

 

Guess this means you would also prefer that this card gets the Attachment trait:

I don't think that the whole discussion is pointless. Sure, cards won't be changed. Sure, the system works lke it is.

 Sure, there is no need to argue about something that is apparently pointless.

 

However, MNT isn't the only one who thinks that the card texts could have been worded better. And as I said earlier, I like that he does not only moan about that problem, but offers a suggestion how it could be done better. And I think that his suggestion has some merit, even if it's too late to implement it.

 

The problem is that there's no middle ground between both of your opinions. You're both right, depending from which PoV you look at the problem. Once you accept that (that and the fact that no one here is in possession of the Holy Grail of Truth), there shouldn't be a problem to respect each others opinion.

 

 

If you're answer to a someone's approach is "irrelevant" and "pointless", what kind of answer do you expect?

 

And if you tell everyone who is not of your opinion that they're "not able to understand your point", well, that mostly won't lead the discussion on a more productive level.

Dude, I'm not telling him his words irrelevant and pointless because he disagrees with me, I tell him this because he does not understands what's going on here. 

Just look - I suggested a better wording and he brought up a FAQ entry and started bragging about keyword(which was never mentioned). And then tried to troll me by posting bats which I meantioned in my very first post of this thread.

There is two variants: he either can't understand my point(I don't mean he can't agree, to agree or disagree you must understand) or just fat trolling me by posting these stupid accusations of his. He proved many times he haven't read a word of my suggestion.

Lol, Nerdmeister tends to have strong opinion and he isn't shy to say it, but I never saw him trolling anyone in this forum.

 

There's a third opiton by the way: he simply has another apporach to the problem.

Approach to the problem? What problem? I approached the problem of encounter attachment text being a hardly readable mess. He is talking about FAQ, fixes to the rules and etc. He thinks I'm trying to re-write the rules of the game.
