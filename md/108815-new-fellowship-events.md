Looks awesome!

 

Also, this quest will be available via POD (as per the article).

Oh my god, I can't even.....Is this a dream? Tom Bombadil! The game's first alternate art card! Swag! And new campaign mode stuff....

 

The Fellowship Event at Gen Con Indy 2014 includes a separate standalone scenario called The Old Forest. Players do not need to play The Old Forest before participating in October’s Fellowship Event. However, both The Old Forestand Fog on the Barrow-downs were designed so that they can be played with The Black Riders Saga Expansion in campaign mode, and come with new Boon and Campaign Mode setup cards. Players can use one or both of the scenarios when playing a campaign.

this totally sucks ass, we finally get tom Bombad and it is a fricking custom card that will only work in that quest. FFG STOP MAKING CARDS WE CAN NOT USE IN OTHER DECKS! It is k to have a few in the saga boxes, but putting them in normal packs is a big no, no!

## 4 [MyNeighbourTrololo on June 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108815-new-fellowship-events/?do=findComment&comment=1123398)

It's not first alternate art card. First one I know about is Brand son of Bain.

 

UPD: Boored, it's not a normal pack, it's a pod quest, which wouldn't feature any players card in any case.

hmm, the third post is already again nothing but complaining, how very surprising *sigh*

 

it's great news, so we get this year two new POD Quests which is absolutely great. And the cherry on top of it, they fit within the BR-Campaign which is awesome but we then need new campaign-log (wanted to say this first before the next guy starts crying 'bout this...)

I'm very happy to see, that this game is getting better and better and the increasing amount of support by the company. There's a bright future for LOTR LCG  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

If you're referring to this one: http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1580300/shelfwear [http://boardgamegeek.com/image/1580300/shelfwear], that was a fan-made alternate art, albeit a good-looking one.

He is like one of the best tactic heroes in the game for multiplayer and at 2 will he also has a place in some solo decks.

I'm absolutely stoked for this. Easily the best news this month so far. The quest itself looks awesome, and that alternate art Aragorn looks AMAZING. Does he have 8 threat? That's insane. It's a shame he will be pretty much impossible to get if I'm not going to the fellowship event. Also, I hope this quest will become available for anybody to buy from the store or whatever. I want to have this, but I'm not going to fellowship events sadly (I live in Chile). But the best of all is that this will be compatible with Black Riders. FFG heard our pleas!

Ooooh this is exciting! The campaign mode will be so long now and there shouldn't be any parts of the books that are missed since these POD's will fill out what the Sagas miss! The full campaign could easily be 30 quests long!! That actually seems too long with burdens and threat penalties could make later quests impossible...

As for that mat and alt art card- I want them sooo bad but am not sure if I'll be able to get them and don't even know what this Fellowship Event actually is.. I wish it wasn't so limited and FFG sold all their play mats, I still want old merch from previous nightmare packs. I really don't like the idea of limited cards or merchandise because so many people miss out on cool stuff :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Aragorn's threat does say 8 and at this age of the game he's not that good of a hero and his ability is weak so to make us want to play him and make him better this version should have less threat so I like it! The card layout is definitely different but I think I enjoy it because it shows more art.

Pleased to see that they're going to expand the sagas with pods so that all parts of the campaign can be represented. Also the inclusion of boons in a PoD increases the idea that other campaigns (Mirkwood for instance) might get PoD campaign expansions.

All and all this is amazing news - apart from the fact my daughter wrecked some of my black riders cards :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

## 29 [CaffeineAddict on June 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108815-new-fellowship-events/?do=findComment&comment=1124209)

The idea of POD expansions that add to campaign mode is great. However, the idea that they will now start producing cards that you can only get in a limited fashion - attending one of these events, is really annoying.

 

I'd love to attend one of these events, but there aren't any near me - so as a collector of the game as well as a player, I will now have an incomplete collection. At least it's only an alt-art card, not a new card, but still.

 

It reminds me of the Babylon 5 card game many years ago (not that I played or collected it), that started producing exclusive cards attached to magazines, and the like - collectors couldn't be sure to find all the cards anymore, so they abandoned the game.

I'm very excited!!! I really like the cool bare-bones layout of the Aragorn card, I'm sure they'll fix the threat, no biggie.

 

I wonder if having print on demand sagas changes the 18 spots in the Campaign Log for LOTR Saga Expansions? are these included in those 18 spots or were they not accounted for? I'm leaning towards not accounted for because 2 expansions per book seems too perfect.

I have to get my local game store in Santa Rosa, CA to host the event! Let's turn on the manipulative charm...

It's definitely a tough balance for FFG to manage. On the one hand, FFG are pretty good about minimizing exclusives compared to other companies and making sure that completionists are happy. On the other hand, they have to provide incentives to actually get players to participate in these events. This is especially difficult for LOTR, where there are no tournaments/glory to provide a draw. Instead, this type of exclusive swag seems like their best bet to rope people in. Alternate art cards are a good solution, as you're not giving players anything "new" in terms of a brand new card, rather just an alternate version of an existing card.

Also, this might be a bit of a dumb question, but are oversea retailers allowed to order these?

I have the opposite view. I think that if we have great art, it should be shown off as much as possible and the card text and such should be minimally designed. That being said, I love what they did with the stats being plain white in the top left, but I'm not really liking how they kept the "over-designed" box  on the bottom and just shrunk it down. It looks silly to me and seems to make the card design inconsistent.

It is nice that the scenario will eventually be available as a PoD product. So, if you cannot get to an event, you just miss out on the playmat and the alt-art card. The good news is that you will most likely be able to buy one from someone at a later date for a reasonable price.

I would certainly agree with that. Here's what I envisioned the cards should be like. Don't mind the symbol changes; Some symbols were easier to just create a new version on my own than try to extract it from other images.

Got it from the artist's website: http://magali-villeneuve.blogspot.com/ [http://magali-villeneuve.blogspot.com/]. A lot of the artists have portfolio sites where you can grab a lot of their LotR card art.

 



> The only thing beautiful on those images is art.

That's the point. The rest of the card is minimal and practical so we can feature the amazing art more prominently. Of course, as a web developer/designer, this is the sort of thing that I like. Some, like Trolo, probably prefer the designs to be intricate works of art themselves, but I prefer to let the individual card art stand out more.

Those are gorgeous! The only thing I dislike on those is where the card type (Hero, Ally. etc.) is placed, but I don't really know where else it could go.

 

As far as the new Aragorn goes, I am sort of indifferent to the layout. It looks different, but it isn't an essential card to own, so most people will never even see it.

They are there on purpose. It doesn't look great, but when you fan out the cards in your hand, you can see only the left edge and with card types on the left you can see the card type at a glance.

Generally true, but when I hold cards in my hand, I have more spacing along the bottom. I don't tend to have the corners touching like that picture.

That doesn't work for left-handed people like me but that's just a minimal problem. Beside this I really like this layout.

I was unaware that left-handed players fanned cards out in the opposite direction. That's interesting.

I have to agree. It looks like someone managed to mix LoTR and Netrunner into something hideous...

## 62 [booored on June 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108815-new-fellowship-events/?do=findComment&comment=1125159)

because the 8 threat error was giving the community convulsions.

They could have just removed that particular picture from the post and left the article up...

They wanted to properly edit it to cancel all the 8 threat talk, I think they also added the link for international retailers but I'm not sure.

There is a new link for international retailers but I agree it was over the hullabaloo about the Aragorn threat. Funny little community we have. I'm still amazed at the 6 page thread about the design of mount attachments

Why? Discussion about game mechanisms is the entire point we are on the forum isn't it? I wish every thread was chatting about the game in that kind of detail.

Contact FFG and pretend to be a store.

Why? They never read the forums anyway.
