Can Frodo Baggins cancel The Nine are Abroad even though it says all characters text boxes are blank?

One question more, can Frodo and Ring cancel keywords? If Nine are Abroad had 'doomed' you must raise 1 anyway?

Yes, when you cancel, the effect you read are not done. When you play test of will, you don't apply the effect of the when revealed even if you read them, a cancel "go back in time".
