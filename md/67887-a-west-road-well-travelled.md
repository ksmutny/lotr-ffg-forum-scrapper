A question regarding West Road Traveller:

The response on this ally says to switch the active location with any location in the staging area.

Does this mean that you technically do not travel to this new location and thus won´t trigger travel effects or does it count as travelling for this purpose?

You won't trigger the Travel effect, because it is "switching", not "travelling"

Just to throw in a second opinion:

 

Angus Lee is of course correct.

 

Reminds me that WRT is getting less powerful as there are more and more ways to explore a location while it's in the staging area. Also the travel effects in the Dwarrodelf cycle are less painful than Mirkwood's.

Though some locations are a pain to have active. Like the dreadfull gap location (can´t remember if that´s the correct name) that has a value of X as it´s progression value, where X is the number of characters in play and it automatically becomes the active location when revealed. By switching it with another you could potentially rid yourself of having to place 10+ progress tokens in exchange for it´s meager 2 threat value. Quite a relief in a location heavy scenario
