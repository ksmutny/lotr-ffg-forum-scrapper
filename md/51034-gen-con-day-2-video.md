 didn't see this on the main page, but it was on FFG's YouTube channel:





still no LOTR stuff... :-/

hopefully there will me a M@O segment!

 They still have two more days of events.  I wouldn't be surprised if LotR gets covered in tomorrow's video.

 still not a peep about LOTR.

 Hmm. You're right.  the most they've had in the videos so far are the posters.

 i was hoping for something about M@O. i mean, there's no tourney and it's not a "new" game, like these vids seem to be focusing on. but, they also showed the SW mini game, but not the LCG; it's been mainly board games an tourney recaps..so maybe they are saving the best for last?

 Let's hope.  I want to know how the M@O event went too.

 My eldest brother is working at gencon as a judge and said there was going to be plenty of LOTR stuff there and it was to my understanding going to be covered. I am uncertain as to why it hasn't been either.

NOTHING on LOTR... WOW, that's lame.

*sigh* I hope someone on the forum will give us the 411 on M@O.

 That is very unfortunate. My brother saw people playing it but didn't get a chance to himself. Too bad I thought people were going to cover it.
