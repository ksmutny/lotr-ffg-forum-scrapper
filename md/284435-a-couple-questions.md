# [A Couple Questions](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/)

## 1 [Stewart777 on October 12, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3501291)

So I'm new to board/card games so have some questions for you folk.

1. I know that you are only allowed to attach a maximum of two restricted attachments per hero but are you allowed to attach two of the SAME attachments two a single hero.

For instance attaching 2 "Citadel Plate [https://ringsdb.com/card/01040]" to 1 hero. Or 2 "Dwarven Axe [https://ringsdb.com/card/01041]" to 1 hero. I doubt it but just thought I'd ask.

And what about attachments that aren't restricted, can you attach 2 of the same attachment to 1 hero/ally?

2. Are you allowed to play (and pay with resources) additional cards from your hand after an enemy has revealed it's shadow card?

3. Are you allowed to  play (and pay with resources) just before the player attacks.

1. Yes, as long as the attachment doesn't say "limit one per character" (or hero, ally, etc.).

2. Only events, since the planning phase is the only time you may play attachments and allies.

3. Same answer as two.

There should be a round sequence chart at the back of your rulebook/learn to play guide that shows you when you can take what actions. I also recommend downloading the FAQ and Rules Reference from FFG. They answer pretty much any question you might have about action windows or anything else.

## 3 [icabod on October 12, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3501344)

For questions 2 and 3, Event cards are the only cards that you can play outside of the planning phase, assuming there is an action window. That said, some events may allow you to get an ally into play - depending in the card.

For question 1... As far as I'm aware there would be no restriction unless the attachment was unique (for example Horn of Gondor).

Oh, and any amount of unrestricted attachments may go on a hero; given that they are not unique.

## 5 [Stewart777 on October 12, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3501369)

Ah ok great, so it's only events that can be played, and of course Action text on a hero's card.

I did read the rule book from the Core set and it didn't address that exact question. Yeah I think the FAQ and other FFG resources should prove useful. Will read that next.

Can attachments ever go on Allies?

Yes, unless the attachment says otherwise.

## 8 [dalestephenson on October 12, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3501556)

Some attachments can only go on allies -- each attachment will specify who or what it can be attached to.

Note that the requirement for attaching only is checked when placed on a character; for example if you put A Burning Branch on a hero who is Lore only because they have Song of Wisdom, and they subsequently lose their Song of Wisdom, A Burning Brand is still attached and still works.

## 9 [NathanH on October 12, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3501759)

Worth noting that for 2) the shadow effect will resolve before you are able to play a card, unless that card specifically responds to shadow cards. So for example if you reveal a shadow card that says "deal 1 damage to defending character" this damage is dealt before you can play e.g. a healing event, potentially killing the defender. However, cards such as Hasty Stroke specifically respond to shadow cards being revealed, so you can play them.

However, you can play actions between resolving the card and completing the enemy attack, so if the shadow card says "attacking enemy gets +1 attack" you can play an event that gives the defender +1 defence before the attack resolves.

## 10 [Stewart777 on October 14, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3502907)

Ok so I just started my first game :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I'm following the rules and am playing a pre-made starter deck from Spirit.

1. Question - I have dealt out my 6 cards starting hand, put 3 resources on the heroes and drawn one card. The card is Stand and Fight with text:

 
> Quote
> 
>  
> 
> Event. Cost: X.
> 
> Action: Choose an ally with a printed cost of X in any player's discard pile. Put that ally into play under your control. (The chosen ally can belong to any sphere of influence.)
> 
>  
> 
>  
> 
>  

Firstly, I'm confused about X - what is the cost. Is it simply the amount on whatever card you choose? So technically it could be any amount.

Secondly I don't have a discard pile yet... so does this card just get put in the discard pile or shuffled back into the deck?

 

2. Also, what happens to card Actions that rely on 2 players for the effect to occur? For instance, I'm playing a 1 player game and have Wandering Took as an Ally in play with the text:

> Quote
> 
> Action: Reduce your threat by 3 to give control of Wandering Took to another player. Raise that player's threat by 3.

Does the text just get ignored? Because that is a huge disadvantage as I could reduce my threat by 3...

 

3. Let's say a Forest Spider is engaged with the Wandering Took, and the FS isn't killed and so goes through to the next round. Can you choose a new defender, or does the defender have to remain the WT?

Yes, X is the cost of the card you are returning from the discard pile.  Basically, if you return a 2-cost card from the pile, you pay 2 resources.  And you'll get a discard pile soon enough :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

LOTR LCG doesn't have a maximum hand-size, so you just keep the card in your hand until such time as you want to play it.  It's useful if an Ally you really wanted to keep gets destroyed in combat, for example.

Wandering Took isn't really much use in Single Player, IMO.  But if you're playing multi-player, or two-handed, then it's a great way to help out if one of the "players" has too much threat,

Great thanks!

And what about this one :

3. Let's say a Forest Spider is engaged with the Wandering Took, and the FS isn't killed and so goes through to the next round. Can you choose a new defender, or does the defender have to remain the WT?

## 13 [dalestephenson on October 14, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3502926)

Yes, you may choose a new defender every time the Forest Spider attacks.  The Forest Spider isn't engaged with Wandering Took -- the spider is engaged with you, the player.

## 14 [Stewart777 on October 14, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3502946)

1. If a hero dies do his resources get put into the resource pile or distributed amongst the heroes of the same sphere?

2. if all characters are exhausted through defending and survive but there is still an enemy that has to engage, does that damage that is applied go undefended - so would ignore defence?

 

Well I got my bum kicked on the first go. Too many locations and enemies (2 Beastmasters  with 2 threat level and two Necromancer's Pass with 3 threat level!) in the staging area and so my threat level just kept increasing and so had to engage the 2 Beastmasters, a King Spider and a Chieften Ufthak simultaneously... hopeless.

This game is hard. But I like it. Thought by going with Eowyn I could deal with quests and locations quite quickly but the locations and enemies just kept piling up. Surprised they included such strong enemies for an introductory game, and this is level 1!

If a hero dies, their resources and attachments are discarded. So yes, resources go back into the resource pile.

And unless you have some way to ready a character, then the attack would go undefended, with the damage going to one of your heroes.

Yes, it's a tricky game, but it's ultimately worth the effort :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Location lock can be a killer in a game, too, where you keep drawing locations and end up making zero progress.

I was just surprised at the toughness of the enemies for an intro to the game ?

Well, you were playing the Spirit deck, which is the worst deck for combat. On the other hand it's probably the best deck for questing. If, on the other hand, you'd played your first game with the Tactics deck you would've been much better equipped to handle enemies, but totally unable to actually complete the quest due to a lack of willpower.

It's worth noting - none of the starter decks in the Core Set are that great. Use them to learn the basics of how to play the game, but beyond that (and especially once you move on to the second quest) you probably want to look into building your own deck or finding a good decklist online to use, mixing two (or maybe three) spheres together rather than just taking all the good and bad cards from a single sphere.

## 19 [Wandalf the Gizzard on October 16, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3505293)

Yes, don't expect to win with those starter decks (although it is possible to do so with each of them). Like PocketWraith said, learn the flow of the game with them, and then move on to deckbuilding.

The tutorial video I watched used Tactics Legolas [https://ringsdb.com/card/01005] to help kill enemies and every time he done that you add 2 progress tokens to the quest, so the Tactics deck wasn't all bad at questing when used like that. 

I think for my next go I'll use Leadership Aragorn (he can spend 1 resource to ready after committing to a quest), Tactics Legolas (can add tokens to quest after defeating an enemy) and Lore Glorfindel (1 resource to heal 1 damage, always useful).

Am I doing it right?

Using three different spheres is quite risky, especially just with a core set. I would replace Glorfindel with Theodred (he can ready Aragorn after questing with his ability).

## 22 [Authraw on October 16, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3505459)

For what it's worth, I almost always use 3 spheres in solo. If you just bring cheap cards you should be fine.

Give it a try and see what works for you!

That doesn't leave me much room for defending either, only Aragorn with 2 armour but I wanted to use his readying ability after questing to attack enemies. Might have to rethink things. I wanted to include Lore for it's healing effects.

Use whatever hero combos you like! I'm just giving (hopefully helpful) tips. If you go with Glorfindel as your Lore hero, I would advise making sure your other two heroes have lower threat. He would work quite well with Denethor and Eowyn.

Is a Lore hero essential in some of the harder quests? I mean some of the enemies hit for 5! So I just assume so sort of healing mechanism could be important.

Healing mechanisms can be important, but there are several other ways to deal with high attack enemies:

Chump block

High defense defenders.  You can get to 5 defense.

Kill them before they kill you -- direct damage and some tactics events

Prevent them from attacking you -- Feint, Forest Snare, low threat and a host of later cards can help with this.

As the card pool expands you'll find damage prevention and even some healing done outside Lore, as well.  I'm not saying Lore isn't a useful spear and healing is sometimes the easiest way to deal with a problem -- but it's not *necessary* to win.

Yeah forest snare and feint are the ones I'm more familiar with this early in the game. And love me a chump block :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but there are occasions were you don't use it of course.

- Could you expand a little more on how you would go about getting your defence up to 5.

 

- Another question. Do the designers want you to use the heroes that they include with expansions? I mean are the games, like The Hobbit: On the Doorstep, designed to play "better" with the heroes included. I know you can use any hero from any set, but do they design it with that in mind.

 

- Also, in On the Doorstep, there are only 3 allies but there are 3 copies of each. But they have the Unique trait... Was that just lazy designing by the developers, because they could've included a few more different dwarf characters in there rather than copies.

## 28 [GrandSpleen on October 17, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3506516)

When you get a new player card, it'll always be 3 copies, except for heroes.  This is true for unique cards, and even for cards which says "limit 1 per deck."  3 copies of a unique card is not necessarily a bad thing, as having them in your deck increases the likelihood of drawing it.  3 copies of a 'limit 1 per deck' is a bit stranger, as you will never use the extra copies unless you plan on including the same card in 2-handed play or if you're building a deck for someone else to play with in multiplayer.

As for other questions--

-Defense: there are player cards that increase your defense stat.  Dunedain Warning, Arwen ally, Gondorian Shield... there are many.  In the core set, there is Protector of Lorien.

-Scenarios are generally not designed for use with the hero that is included in the expansion.  There are some exceptions.  The Deluxe expansions and Saga expansions include heroes which fit thematically in those quests, for the most part.  However, I don't think there has ever been a compelling 'game mechanics' reason to build a deck with a character that was included with a particular scenario.  As for the smaller adventure packs, the lead designer of the game has stated that the entire cycle's cards are designed at the same time, and then distributed up for release by the marketing department.  I remember thinking in some cases that they included a hero who you really DON'T want to use in that particular scenario, although I can't think of any examples at the moment.

## 29 [Wandalf the Gizzard on October 17, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3506840)

Mmm, I wouldn't say so. Those enemies are more likely to be blocked by wimpy allies  ("chump blockers"). In some four player games, healing is essential. But solo, with just a core set, you could be quite successful without Lore at all.

## 30 [Stewart777 on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3507639)

Quick question. Legolas' text reads:

> Quote
> 
> Response: After Legolas participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, place 2 progress tokens on the current quest.

Now I have a location that is active. So once Legolas destroys an enemy do I put the tokens on the quest or the location.

 

Been an interesting game, and am learning just how lethal starting off with a high threat level can be. I engaged Ungoliant's Spawn really early way before I was prepared but luckily I had a Forest Snare to save me.

## 31 [dalestephenson on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3507660)

Active location always buffers current quest, so Legolas's tokens from destroying an enemy would go on the active location first.  Unless a card both directs you to place progress on the quest card *and* bypass the active location (some encounter cards do this), you can't bypass the active location.

## 32 [Stewart777 on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3507671)

Ah bummer been putting them on the quest... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Thought I was in the clear.

I suppose the same applies for Blade of Gondolin [https://ringsdb.com/card/01039] as well?

## 33 [dalestephenson on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3507750)

Correct, it applies to Blade of Gondolin as well.  In fact, I believe it applies to every single player card that places progress on the "current quest".

## 34 [Stewart777 on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3507767)

- Another one. When committed to the quest and you have excess tokens after questing (eg. location = 3 cost, willpower = 4) does that extra token then get carried over to the quest, or is it lost?

- When you don't kill a enemy outright and it engages you in the next round does it get a second shadow card?

Hope you guys don't mind all the questions.

## 35 [dalestephenson on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3507806)

When you quest sucessfully you generate progress (willpower minus threat in staging).  This progress is placed on the active location until explored, then placed on the current quest.  The active location is "buffering" progress that would otherwise be placed on the current quest, so progress is not lost -- if you placed four progress from questing and the active location required three, the active location would be explored and one progress would be placed on the current quest.

However, if you play a player card that places progress on a *location* rather than the quest, it doesn't overflow on to the quest if you place more on the active location than it could hold.  The "extra" progress is just lost.

All shadow cards from not-dead enemies are discarded at the end of the combat phase.  If you fail to kill an enemy engaged with you, it remains engaged with you and on the next combat phase will receive a *new* shadow card.  This won't be a second card, because the old shadow card has been discarded.

## 36 [Stewart777 on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3507828)

Great thanks. Another one. When you have quested successfully, the final quest says that you must choose a spider enemy and put it in the staging area. Fine. But then the text in a new sentence says:

> Quote
> 
> The players must find and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn to win this game.

Now does that mean that you have to keep on playing until you come across US in the encounter deck, or does it mean that you have to go through the deck and also add it to the staging area along with the Spider enemy?

I think he means with several other expansions. I don't think it's possible with just the core.

No, not really.

You can still include three copies of unique cards in your deck, just not in play. This helps to find those cards with more consistency, even though you can only have one copy in play.

Back in the Core set, the phrasing department was still in the works. It essentially means that you must defeat it to win. You can either wait for Ungoliant's Spawn to be revealed from the encounter deck or search for it as one of the spider enemies the quest instructs you to fetch.

Ah thanks, I went and got US and a spider enemy and still managed to win :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] My threat was up to 44 though so wouldn't have been able to wait until he appeared.

When all the questing has been finished does the questing phase just get ignored?

## 39 [dalestephenson on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3507917)

Unless the quest card directs you to skip the questing phase it happens every turn, and if you quest unsuccessfully your threat will rise.  You may place progress beyond what a quest card requires if it has additional completion requirements -- in certain quests and with certain cards, the extra progress will come in handy.

Regards quest cards. If a quest requires 8 tokens to complete, but you quest for 9 does that extra token carry over onto the next quest card or is it lost. We dealt with the locations regarding this, but not quests.

The progress from completing a quest card won't carry over (source: there's a statement about it in the core set manual)

Chump blocking is often an effective way to deal with that, so healing isn't always needed. Use a 1 or 2 cost ally to defend a big hit, then kill the enemy ASAP. Mix in a few cards like Feint or Quick Strike and you can mitigate risk from big enemies.

 

Healing definitely helps in many quests, but there are multiple strategies to deck building so don't lock yourself into thinking something is absolutely necessary to your deck.

Here's a tricky one - let's say I've committed 2 characters to questing. One of the characters has 2 damage tokens on him already (he has a total of 3 hit points), and then a Treachery is revealed which indicates that I have to deal 1 damage to each exhausted character, which would effectively kill the character.

My question is - does he still contribute his willpower to the quest, because he committed to the quest before the Treachery was revealed, or is he discarded without contributing his willpower.

Edit: Just had a look at the back of the rule book and it says:

A: Commit Characters, B: Staging, C : Quest Resolution, so Quest Resolution comes after Staging, so that would mean my Hammersmith would be discarded and not contribute his willpower?

The way you phrase this makes me think you've gotten it slightly confused. Ungoliant's Spawn is a Spider enemy. You don't pull out US 'along with' the Spider enemy, you pull it out as the Spider enemy the quest card tells you to get (In multiplayer *each* player has to pull out a Spider so you will get additional Spiders, but if you're playing solo you just grab US so you can win and leave it at that).

Got another one. On the Journey Along the Anduin quest (2B) the text reads:

> Quote
> 
> Reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck each quest phase. Do not make engagement checks during the encounter phase. (Each player may still optionally engage 1 enemy each encounter phase.)

So you reveal 1 extra card during the Quest phase, got that.

- Won't that raise your threat by unmanageable amounts if you don't commit a lot of characters to the quest leaving none to defend or attack.

- What do they mean by "Do not make engagement checks during the encounter phase."

- Do they mean we don't have to engage enemies even if their threat level is equal or less to the players?

- Does it mean that we can engage enemies only if we choose to?

 

This game is tough, they throw a Hill Troll at you straight away!

1) Yes, revealing extra cards makes it more likely you will quest unsuccessfully if you don't send enough willpower.  Send a lot of willpower.  You don't want to linger at stage two.

2) The lack of engagement checks during the encounter phase means no enemies will automatically engage you regardless of your threat.  However, if you *want* to engage an enemy, you are still allowed one (only one) optional engagement during the engagement phase.

There are ways to otherwise engage more than one enemy through other cards. Though most of the time you get one and only one engagement.

 

There's that leadership ally that allows you to pull an enemy to you in the core set, the name escapes me at the moment. There's also a hero in a later set that allows for two optional engagements.

 

Most of the time you only get one though. It's better to not linger at that stage if you can help it rather than retool your deck around that stage.

I think there's only one player card that alters the number of *optional* engagements, and that's Halbarad.  But there are a number of other ways to engage enemies in the staging area.  Even better are the cards that let you *kill* enemies in the staging area -- a souped up Dunhere made this quest pretty easy for me in the September solo league.

Quick question. What happens if you have all the quest points needed to move onto the next quest but also have a active location, does the location just remain in place for the next quest?

Side note. I was doing so well until a shadow card told me to ignore all my heroes defence. At that point Denethor was defeated... and it's been hard going since, but now a second Hill Troll has turned up so it's probably game over.

## 53 [NathanH on October 21, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3510082)

## 54 [Rouxxor on October 21, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3510094)

The active location rest. It may occur when you to put progress to the quest by avoiding the current location (very few cards allow to do that though) or when you meet others criteria later (like killing the troll after placing enough progress counters on the quests, you go instantly to the next quest).

1) In the rules it says that a deck must contain a minimum of 50 cards, does that mean going over the 50 cards is legal?

The Goblin Sniper is starting to annoy me (and I can attack the Hill Troll there while I'm at it) so I want to include Great Yew Bow [https://ringsdb.com/card/132014] (On the Doorstep) to attack enemies in the staging area with Legolas. So essentially I will have 53 cards, is that legal?

2) Also, what happens if you run out of cards (not that I have). Do you just reshuffle your deck and use it again like you do with the encounter deck or do you lose the game?

3)  With A Test Of Will [https://ringsdb.com/card/01050], is it only the "when revealed" - so basically only treacheries - that can be cancelled, so not a "forced" effect for example?

4) What "Condition" are they referring to when the response on Miner of the iron Hills [https://ringsdb.com/card/01061] card states:

Can you cancel a treachery with this effect?

1) Minimum of 50 cards is only for official tournaments or Fellowship events, and yes, going over 50 cards is "legal." There is no minimum deck size rule for casual play. That said, most players follow the minimum 50 card rule as a convention. Keep in mind that the more cards in your deck, the more diluted it is, the more difficult it will be to draw those cards you really want in your hand.

2) If you run out of cards, that's it, your deck is empty and you can't draw cards any longer. The core set does contain a spirit card called "Will of the West," which allows you to reshuffle your discarded cards back into your deck. It comes in really handy in certain quests. Note that post errata, whenever you play a copy of Will of the West, it is removed from the game, and not discarded.

3) A Test of Will cancels any "when revealed" effect on a card, whether on a treachery, location, or enemy. It does not, however, cancel "Forced" effects, passive effects, or other traits found on encounter cards (e.g., Surge, Doomed, etc.).

4) Some treacheries (e.g., "Caught in a Web" from the core set) are conditions that are attached to heroes or characters (read the text on "Caught in a Web," it specifies that it is a "condition" attachment). If "Caught in a Web" is attached to one of your heroes, when you play Minor of the Iron Hills from your hand, he will discard one copy of "Caught in a Web" to the discard pile. Can't remember if there are other treacheries with condition attachments in the core set. Aside from that, the Minor of the Iron Hills does not cancel treacheries (only "A Test of Will" does that in the core set, or Eleanor).

When you have the required amount of progress tokens on a quest and you then quest successfully, do you put excess tokens on the quest?

Say for example the quest requires 8 tokens and you could increase that to 10. I have this situation because I'm waiting to kill the Hill Troll in Journey Along the Anduin. It would be useful if a treachery came along and stole 4 of my tokens for example...

How do you guys deal with Hummerhorns [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Hummerhorns-Core]? Their stats are just fine to deal with, but the text reads:

 

> Quote
> 
> Forced: After Hummerhorns engages you, deal 5 damage to a single hero you control.

5 damage will outright kill some heroes in one go. Do you buff up with armour or the like?

You could also attack them in the staging area I guess.

## 63 [Miceldars on October 22, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3510890)

Try to keep your threat below 40, and you won't have to deal with it.

You can kill it while it is in the staging area with dunhere or some direct damage (gandalf). You can also put a citadel plate on a hero to prevent him from death (gimli is a good choice, it will give him +5 attack).

Note that this enemy grants victory points. When you defeat it, it doesn't go to the discard pile (you won't have to face it again if you shuffle the discard pile of the encounter set)

Ah nice, I never new that. I haven't had to reshuffle the discard pile yet but that will prove useful in the future.

Let me just clarify, you don't mean that Gandalf can do damage in the staging area, rather just deal damage once engaged right?

## 65 [Miceldars on October 22, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3510929)

When Gandalf (from the core set) enters in play, he can reduce your threat, make you draw or deal 4 damage to an enemy. That enemy can be anywhere, included the staging area. That's a way to kill enemies before they can engage you. You can can use sneak attack + gandalf to kill an enemy you just revealed from the encounter deck (assuming he has 4 or less hit points, like hummerhorns)

Just to clarify, you must wait for an action window do do this (green spaces in the round sequence in the back of the rulebook). So any when revealed effects on the enemy will trigger before you have a chance to sneak Gandalf in for the kill.

## 67 [dalestephenson on October 22, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3511010)

The bad part about using Sneak attack plus Gandalf after staging is that it's too late to commit Gandalf to the quest and use his excellent stats.  Of course, if your threat is 40+ and hummerhorns just got revealed, that may be better than losing a hero.  On the other hand, if your threat is 40-44 and you know Hummerhorns is still in the deck, it might be a good idea to sneak attack gandalf before committing to the quest, and use him to reduce your threat by five.

Just as a clarification, defense (i guess that's what you ment with armor?) does not actually help against this (or other, similar) "direct damage" effects. (And yes without attachments this instakills all but 1 currently released heroes.)

Citadel Plate is armour that grants the hero it is attached to +4 hit points. So it certainly helps soak up the direct damage from Hummerhorns. It's a hit point buff, not a defence buff.

Got a question about the "Seize them! [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Seize-Them-TSoH]" Objective card from The Sands of Harad expansion. This is the first time I've come across an Objective card so a little unsure. The text reads:

> Quote
> 
> Forced: After an enemy attacks and destroys a character, remove X progress from the main quest, X is the attacking enemy's Threat. At the end of the round, if the main quest has been in play the entire round and there are no progress tokens on it, the players lose the game.

- Firstly, does this card remain in the staging area the whole of the 1A/1B part of the quest, or even the entire quest? So you basically have to have tokens on the main quest at all times otherwise you lose?

- Secondly, as the bold text reads, do you really have to be able to place progress tokens on the quest in the first round?! And if you don't you lose the game? I ask because the setup instructs you to also put a Location into play (I chose one with a low token requirement, "Narrow Alleyway [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Narrow-Alleyway-TSoH]", which requires 2 progress tokens). That would mean you have to almost commit all your heroes to questing which would leave none to defend or attack with. And the setup forces you to engage with an Umbar Sentry [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Umbar-Sentry-TSoH] straight away and his text reads:

> Quote
> 
> Forced: When Umbar Sentry attacks, either remove 1 progress token from the main quest, or it gets +2 Attack for this attack.

If I have got this right then it's truly a case of out of the frying pan and into the fire.

## 71 [Rouxxor on October 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3513326)

The objective remain as long nothing tell you to put it away. I think there is a point on the quest where you get out of town, but I'm not sure.

And yeah, you have to put progress on the quest every turn or you loose. That's the specificity of the quest.

If you don't have heroes with many willpower and you are not able to play allies you may be able to send everyone in quest. That may be a problem of your deck or your starting hand though.

I don't see what is important about the fact that narrow alleyway require 2 progress tokens on the turn one. If it lay in staging area you don't put progress here but in the quest anyway. Then you will probably travel to it so next turn you need to put win the quest by 3: 2 for clearing the location and 1 for not loosing. It still worth to travel because elsewhere there is 2 more threat in the staging area.

1) Got a question on Archery, let's take the Umbar Sentry [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Umbar-Sentry-TSoH]. The text reads:

> Quote
> 
>  
> 
> Surge.   Archery 1.  
> 
> Forced: When Umbar Sentry attacks, either remove 1 progress token from the main quest, or it gets +2 Attack for this attack.
> 
>  

 
 
I read the rules, but it only states that you deal out the archery damage at the start of the combat phase (dealt out as you wish), which in this case is 1 damage. No problem. But does that mean then that the Umbar Sentry gets to attack twice? Once from the archery damage and then a second time using his +2 attack?
 
2) Also how do you guys deal with enemies that have +4 and over in attack in the early stages of the game. I use Denethor as a defender as he has 3 defence. Unless you get out some chump blockers quickly you are going to get hit hard.
 
And lastly, how's this for a Treachery!
Enemy Pursuit [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Enemy-Pursuit-TSoH]'s text reads:
> Quote
> 
> When Revealed: Either remove all progress from the main quest, or assign X damage among characters in play. X is the number of progress tokens on the main quest.

Surely that is game over given the Objective [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Seize-Them-TSoH]'s conditions that you must have progress tokens on the main quest at the end of a round or you lose, unless you have someone like Legolas (Core) who can put progress on a quest when killing an enemy. And if you rather assign damage, that can be a huge amount depending on the amount of tokens on the quest. Luckily for me I had a Test of Will, which saved my butt.

Some of these quests seem like they really would play better 2-handed.

1)"Archery" is not an attack, it's just an amount of damage you must deal to your characters. You can't defend archery. And you take damage from archery even if the enemy is not engaged with you.

So the Umbar Sentry inflicts you 1 damage from archery, and then make an attack (if he is engaged with you).

2)You can chump block, cancel the attack (with Feint for example), kill the enemy before he attacks (with Quick strike), defend with a good defender then kill the enemy and heal damage, keep low threat to avoid engaging the enemy...

3)The treachery removes all the progress token, but you can still put some on the quest at the end of the quest phase (if you have enough willpower). So if you quest successfully, you can place tokens on the quest and you don't lose (you just lose one turn or two). You can also cancel the treachery with "A test you will" or something like this (edit : that's what you did, I missed that part)

Thanks for that! You must admit that it is a pretty lethal Treachery though, because if you don't quest successfully (you are already committed so if you don't have Eowyh (Core) you are in trouble) it's game over just like that.

1) One more question. I must be missing something here because this doesn't make any sense.

Haradrim Estate [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Haradrim-Estate-TSoH]'s text reads:

Travel: Search the encounter deck and discard pile for a Harad enemy and put it into play engaged with the first player. Then, place 1 progress on the main quest, bypassing the active location. Shuffle the encounter deck.

Specifically the bold part. What happens if you have 2 Haradrim Estates in play in the staging area? So you place one as the active location. What then? The text states that you cannot place progress on HE while it is in the staging area.

Or are they simply referring to a situation where a character like Northern Tracker [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Northern-Tracker-Core] would place progress on the location while in the staging area, and that is not allowed?

Wandalf --> Yes, you can still play cards after the quest resolution, but it's not something you often do, I think.

 

Stewart --> I think you can't place progress token on it with nothern tracker or other card which allow you to place progress token on locations in the staging area. There is some locations like this on various scenarios (when they're not just "immune to player card effects")

One more. I've attached Self Preservation [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Self-Preservation-Core] (SP) to Denethor and he has been attacked but is still alive.

During what phase can I exhaust SP to heal Denethor. Can I heal him for instance after the attack or is it only during the Planning phase that you can do this?

You can do it during any action window. Phase restricted actions are displayed like that : "[Combat] Action : something" (for an action you can do only during combat phase), or it is specified in the text card.

To chime in about the Estate and no progress while in staging, by using that phrasing rather than just "Immune to player card effects" it allows you to still place attachments on it, but disallows Northern Tracker-like effects.

All cards in this card game that refer to themselves only to refer to that specific copy. Each Haradrim Estate only means itself.

That said, if two of the card below were in the staging area, you are still allowed to place progress on them with effects like Northern Tracker.

> Quote

When an enemy makes an "immediate attack" like this does that attack bypass your defence? So would you get a chance to declare a defender? So in that case the damage would go straight onto the character, which in this case is a Gondorian Spearman [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Gondorian-Spearman-Core] who has 1 Defence and 1 Hit Point.

It's like a regular attack. You can declare a defender and take his defense in account. Note that in this example, you do not deal a shadow card to the enemy, but most of those "immediate attack" effects do not have this statement and you have to deal a shadow card, just like normal attacks in combat phase.

That also mean this enemy would attack twice the turn he engages you (the immediate attack, and then his regular one).

Stating that could imply every round for the rest of the game. As it's currently stated, is only during that part of the quest.

I asked this question before about progress carrying over to the next quest card, and was told that progress only carries over from an active loacvtion to a quest and not from a quest to the following quest. This FAQ from FFG seems to contradict what I was told, or am I just misunderstanding:

Any thoughts?

## 92 [NathanH on October 28, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3516962)

In this example there are two separate triggers each placing progress. So the procedure goes like this:

 * Quest card has 2 progress remaining
 * Legolas with Blade of Gondolin kills an enemy. Two Responses are available to trigger
 * Player chooses to activate Legolas's Response first, placing two progress on the quest.
 * The Blade of Gondolin response is still available, but quest progression takes priority so you go to the next stage and do everything until side B gets turned over
 * Blade of Gondolin response is still available, so the player can trigger this for 1 progress.

Compare this with the opposite ordering of triggered responses:

 * Quest card has 2 progress remaining
 * Legolas with Blade of Gondolin kills an enemy. Two Responses are available to trigger
 * Player chooses to activate Blade of Gondolin's Response first, placing one progress on the quest.
 * The Legolas response is still available, so the player can trigger this for 2 progress.
 * One (or possible 2; it isn't clear to me) progress is placed on the quest, which progresses the quest. The excess progress from Legolas is lost.

The key point to take from this is that, when you have multiple responses from the same trigger, you choose the order to trigger them, and completely resolve the first and all its associated consequences before going back to the next one and triggering that.

Got a question regards the setup and initial play for The Long Arm of Mordor, specifically Surprise Attack [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Surprise-Attack-TSoH].

Let me see if I have this right... you start with all your heroes in the staging area, including 1 Sauron's Enforcers [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Sauron%27s-Enforcers-TSoH]. So the only character you start off with is an Objective-Hero (I chose Yazan [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Yazan-TSoH]). You also start off with 2 resources for Yazan. Is that the setup?

Then play continues as per normal, gain 1 resource and draw a card?

So after you quest successfully and get one hero back you have to exhaust them, does that hero remain exhausted for 2B [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Find-the-Others-TSoH] as well?

For the remainder of the game, heroes in the staging area are in play but under no player’s control, immune to player card effects, and their text boxes are considered to be blank.

This particularly effect if no different from any other reason a hero becomes exhausted. The hero remains exhausted until the next Refresh phase or until you use some other means of readying it.

Quick one.

1) Can you take an attachment from one hero/ally and move it to a different hero/ally?

2) What happens to an existing attachment when you want to replace it with another, does it just get discarded, or can you give it to another character?

3) Also, if a hero/ally with an attachment dies does that attachment get discarded along with the ally or can it be attached to another character? That's how I've been playing but thought I should ask. Not so quick then...

## 97 [dalestephenson on October 30, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3519277)

1) You can only move an attachment if you have a player card that allows you to do so.  For example, Long Lake Trader can exhaust to move an item from a character you control to another character.  Spare Hood and Cloak moves automatically when you use it.  And various signals (e.g. Dunedain Warning) can move from one hero to another by the current hero playing one resource.

2) Absent some card effect, you can't "replace" an existing attachment.  If your hero has two Restricted attachments, you can't put another one until one of the current one goes away via card effect (for example, an encounter card causing you to discard an attachment).

3) If a character leaves play, the attachments on it will go to the discard piles of whichever player originally had the attachment in their deck.  Exception -- the hero Spirit Bard has a response (once per phase) that lets those attachments go back into the players' hands instead of their discard piles.

1) Only if a card allows you to do so like Long Lake Trader or Signals [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Category=Attachment%20Movement] .

2) As long as cards do not state otherwise you can stack as many attachments as you like. However there are only two restricted attachments per character allowed, so if you want to attach a third one to them you have to discard one of the other two. You cannot play a second copy of a 'limit one per character' attachment on the same character.

3) It gets discarded except when Bard son of Brand [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Bard-son-of-Brand-TWoR] is in play.

Aren't you allowed to play a third restricted attachment on a character, but you have to chose and discard one immediately after?

Looking it up, that seems to be correct.  You aren't allowed to do the same trick directly with unique attachments, playing a unique to make the already-played unique go away.  You also can't play a limit-1-per character attachment to make the same attachment already attached go away, though I'm not sure why you'd ever want to do that.

So examples -- Denethor has a Gondorian Shield and Horn of Gondor attached, using his two restricted spots.  You *can* play Citadel Plate on Denethor, but you would have to discard either Gondorian Shield or Horn of Gondor to make room for it.

Denethor has a Gondorian Shield and Celebrian's Stone attached, using his two restricted spots.  You *cannot* play a different copy of Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn, causing Denethor's Celebrian's Stone to go away.  You *can* play Horn of Gondor on Denethor, choose to make Celebrian's Stone go away, and then play Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn.

When a player is told that an enemy is to make an immediate attack, does that mean you don't wait until the combat phase, but rather commence immediately with combat?

2) Quick edit. When a card (Treachery [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Biting-Insects-TMk] in this case) says to discard a random card from your hand, does that mean you have to shuffle your hand and pick one while they are turned upside down, or can you choose which card to discard?

When a card instructs you to make an immediate attack, you resolve it there and then, following the normal rules for enemy attacks in the combat phase. Always deal a shadow card for immediate attacks unless stated not to. The enemy still attacks as normal during combat as well.

When a card says to discard a random card from your hand, you cannot choose: the card is selected randomly. You may choose if it uses the terminology "choose and discard one card . . ." or "discard one card . . ."

Is this condition for 1 round only or does it continue through rounds until you get a card that can remove the condition? Because it would quickly kill the hero if it remains attached and then it's more than likely game over.

You can also cancel the treachery cards that give you these conditions. 

The above stated condition Terrible Fever you might not particulary care about, if you have enough healing (and in fringe cases like Gloin etc. might even be beneficial).

The trouble with Fortune Or Fate is that my questing hero is Spirit and it's usually her who gets killed, so I have no more Spirit resources to pay for a Spirit card... And it's the only one of the 3 I own, but will look into getting the others.

Got a question about side quests. Are they optional, meaning can you leave them in the staging area indefinitely?

They have no threat strength so that is not a problem, but they do have text like for instance with Guardians of the Jungle [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Guardians-of-the-Jungle-TMk], the only thing that would have to be done is raise each locations threat by 1.

## 113 [DrPeterEnis on November 1, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3521032)

Yes sidequests are optional. You can leave them indefinetely as long as you can stomach their effects. (and sidequest heavy adventuteres also often have cards that combo with “number of quest cards in play“.)

At the start of the quest phase you decide which quest (side or not) is the current quest for the turn. So you can ignore a side quest (from the encounter deck or one of the player's one) until you feel good on tackling it. Of course their effect keeps influencing the game even if they are not the current quest. You can find more information about sidequests in the Lost Realm boxed set.

Encounter side-quests usually have some obnoxious effect from being in play, so you can ignore them as long as you can stomach the penalty.  User side-quests have some benefit from completing them, so you can ignore them forever but won't get any benefit until they are done.

Note that at the quest phase you decide which is the current quest for the *phase*, and not the *round*.  So even if you quested against a side-quest during the quest phase, you can't use Legolas' response to place progress on it during the combat phase -- it would go towards the main quest.

Active locations will buffer progress placed on a side quest just like it would on a main quest.

Let me see if I understand you correctly.

- A side-quest doesn't take the place of a location, rather it is put into play alongside an active location.

- Core Legolas' response would not go toward the side-quest, it would bypass this and rather go directly onto the main quest/active location.

You are indeed correct, my mistake.

Basically if you choose so during the Quest Phase a side-quest can become the current quest, that is to say the quest card that receives the progress tokens during the Quest Resolution step. Outside of the quest phase the current quest is still the top card of the quest deck (sidequests are not part of the quest deck, even though I usually put them near the quest deck in the play area). There are sometimes effects that take place when a side-quest becomes the current quest, see the Guardians of the Jungle you put for an example before.

Got a few more. I know some of these might seem obvious but I want to be sure.

1) Does Erebor Hammersmith [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Erebor-Hammersmith-Core]'s response

> Quote
> 
> Response: After you play Erebor Hammersmith, return the topmost attachment [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Search?CardType=Attachment] in any player's discard pile to his hand.

trigger every time you play/exhaust him or only once, after he enters play the first time. I ask because Miner of the Iron Hills [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Miner-of-the-Iron-Hills-Core]' response is a little differently worded in that it says

> Quote
> 
> Response: After Miner of the Iron Hills enters play, choose and discard 1 Condition attachment from play.

which would lead one to conclude that a condition is discarded only when Miner enters play for the first time. Do I have this right?

2) The Savage Souths [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Savage-South-TMk]' response reads

> Quote
> 
> When Revealed: Each player discards the top 5 cards of his deck. Each player discards each card he controls that shares a title with any of the 5 cards he just discarded.

By "control" do they mean, cards that are in play or additionally cards that are in your hand as well? Because technically you don't control the cards in your hand yet, or not?

3) And now for my favourite who continually bugs me... I had 1 Terrible Fever [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Terrible-Fever-TMk] already attached to my questing hero when I drew another Terrible Fever! Does this mean I have to attach a second TF to the same hero (as no other heroes were questing), so 2 Terrible Fevers attached to 1 hero?

"After you play" means you have to actually play the card to trigger the effect.

After it enters play" means any effect that causes the given card to enter play (like sneak attack) would trigger the effect.

Yeah but do you see the difference between the 2 cards. The way Erebor Hammersmith is worded (After you play Erebor Hammersmith,...) could mean that every time you play it the effect is triggered, where as with Miner it is quite clear that it is only when Miner "enters play".

The way you have written this, it makes it sound like "play" is something you will do repeatedly with a card.  Maybe this is your source of confusion?  "Playing" a card means paying its cost and putting it into play, usually from your hand. "Play" does not mean "exhaust" or "use" the card, so it's not something you will do repeatedly.

## 124 [Wandalf the Gizzard on November 2, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3522253)

Yes, you play a card once, therefore any given instance of a response to that can only trigger once.

Busy trying Journey Up the Anduin, man this is a hard one. At the beginning of every encounter phase if you have a resource on the quest you have to play a card from the Evil Creatures deck... That's double the encounter cards plus you can potentially get 2 Hill Trolls! This is way harder than anything I've tried yet. Anyone finished JUTA yet?

Anyway, got a question about Lost In the Wild [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Lost-in-the-Wild-TWoR], the text reads

> Quote

> When Revealed: The player with the most cards in his hand without a copy of Lost in the Wilderness adds Lost in the Wild to his hand. (While in a player’s hand, Lost in the Wild gains: "Cannot be discarded by player card effect. Forced: After you play a card, discard each card in your hand.")

So basically you keep this Treachery card in your hand until the next time you play a card from your hand and then you discard every other card from your hand; so you're left with no cards in your hand. Is that right?

I manage to win it after 2/3 loss with a solo mono tactics decks, a pretty weak solo deck to me. Many of my solo decks will crush it without looking really to his mechanism. But my reference is power deck build with the full cardpool so, nightmare aside, very few new scenario are challenging.

It is right. So if you can't counter it (test of will) play a card as fast as possible so you won't discard any of your future draw.

Got a question about Goblin Sniper [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Goblin-Sniper-Core] and the Great Yew Bow [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Great-Yew-Bow-THOtD].

GS' text reads

> Quote
> 
> During the encounter phase, players cannot optionally engage Goblin Sniper if there are other enemies in the staging area.Forced: If Goblin Sniper is in the staging area at the end of the combat phase, each player deals 1 point of damage to 1 character he controls.

GYB's text reads

> Quote
> 
> Attach to a hero with the printed Ranged keyword. Combat Action: Choose an enemy in the staging area. Exhaust Great Yew Bow and attached hero to make a ranged attack against that enemy. Declare attached hero as the attacker. No other attackers can be declared for this attack.

During the combat phase, can you kill the GS while he is in the Staging Area?

I ask because when they say "engage", by that definition it would mean that GS would have to come out of the Staging Area and then be placed in the player area and engage the player. And technically you're not engaging the enemy, you're making a ranged attack (sniping) on the enemy. Thoughts?

The only thing Goblin Sniper stops you from doing is using the optional engagement step in the Encounter Phase to optionally engage it. Since Great Yew Bow has nothing to do with this step, it's fine to use it.

The general trick with Journey Up the Anduin is to stall on Stage 1, doing the best you can to clear active locations without placing progress on the main quest. That will give you some time to build up your board state before taking on the rest of the quest.

Cards that let you adjust how much you're sending after staging (but before resolving the quest) can be really helpful here. Protector of Lorien, Radagast's Cunning, and Secret Paths, for example, all let you under quest by a bit and then add just the right amount to avoid placing progress on the main quest.

Good thinking. While on the subject. If you can place progress on the active location/quest do you have to.

For instance with Tactics Legolas and his Response which puts 2 progress on the active location when killing/participating in a kill. Do you have to add that progress or can you choose not to?

## 133 [Authraw on November 3, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3523327)

Yes, you absolutely can! There is an action window between every step of enemy attacks (signify attacking enemy, declare and exhaust defender, reveal shadow card, calculate combat damage,  and assign damage) so you could even wait until after the shadow effect resolves before using Unexpected Courage if you wanted.

The hero with Unexpected Courage cannot, however, attack the same enemy twice in the same phase. Defending multiple attacks from the same or different attackers is fine, though.

Not quite right, you may only declare one attack against each eligible enemy, but as long as someone else legally declares the attack, you are free to join. Even events like Quick Strike and Hands upon the Bow allow multiple attacks.

This also isn't quite right, except in the case of a ranged character and an enemy considered to be engaged with all players.  Ranged characters from an unengaged player can join in an attack declared by an engaged player, but an attack declared by an unengaged player (using ranged characters) cannot be joined by characters controlled by another player (engaged or not).

## 141 [Amicus Draconis on November 8, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3528128)

> 36 minutes ago, dalestephenson said:

Where does it say that?

The rules say about ranged:

A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players. A character can declare ranged attacks against these targets while its owner is declaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are declared by other players. In either case, the character must exhaust and meet any other requirements necessary to make the attack.

And the FAQ says about limitations on attack :

When a player is the active attacker during the combat phase, the game rules grant him the option to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged. If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able to declare attacks against enemies with which he is not engaged, the game rules still only provide for a single attack against each of these enemies.
However, if a player makes an attack against an enemy by a card effect such as Quick Strike (CS 35) or Hands Upon the Bow (D 131), that is an extra attack and does not count against the limit of 1 attack.
Characters are not limited as to how many times they can participate in attacks against the same enemy, provided each attack can be legally declared, and the character is ready and eligible to be declared as an attacker.

Nowhere can I read, you cannot join a ranged attack, it even says you can "participate in attacks against the same enemy" unlimited times under certain conditions.

Reviewing the rulings, you are correct -- a ranged character not engaged with an enemy *can* join in attacks declared by another player, unengaged or not.  What they can't do is join in a ranged attack against an engaged enemy.  So I'll use an example to illustrate my understanding of how it works, and assume that Path of Need is attached to the active location, so that heroes can attack without exhausting.

Scenario A: Player 1 has Tactics Bard, Player 2 has Tactics Legolas, Player 3 has Tactics Gimli and is engaged with a non-immune troll.  Player 1 uses Bard to declare a ranged attack on the troll, who now has -2 defense (thanks to Bard's ability).  Legolas is ranged and can join the attack, but Gimli cannot join.  Player 2 uses Legolas to declare a ranged attack on the troll, Bard joins the attack, giving the troll -4 defense (his ability, cumulative), but Gimli cannot join.  Player 3 uses Gimli to declare an attack on the troll, Legolas and Bard both join the attack, giving the troll -6 defense.

Scenario B: Player 1 has Tactics Bard, Player 2 has Tactics Legolas and is engaged with a non-immune troll, Player 3 has Tactics Gimli.  Player 1 uses Bard to declare a ranged attack on the troll, who now has -2 defense.  Legolas can't join because he's engaged, Gimli can't join because he's not ranged.  Player 2 uses Legolas to declare an attack on the troll, Bard joins the attack and the troll now has -4 defense.  Player 3 can't declare an attack at all if he lacks a ready ranged character.

Scenario C : Player 1 has Tactics Bard and is engaged with a non-immune troll, Player 2 has Tactics Legolas, Player 3 has Tactics Gimli.  Player 1 uses Bard to declare an attack on the troll, but since it isn't ranged the troll's defense is not affected.  Legolas can join the attack.  Player 2 can use Legolas to declare an attack on the troll on his turn, but Bard cannot join because he's engaged.  Player 3 cannot declare an attack at all if he lacks a ready ranged character.

Got a question about ally Gandalf from the Core set.

Now the text says when Gandalf enters play you can 

 * draw 3 cards
 * deal 4 damage to 1 enemy in play
 * reduce your threat by 5.

So let's say I immediately deal damage to an enemy engaged with me and kill it. My question is can Gandalf then go on to quest or do any other actions in that round before he is discarded?

I was watching a video and according to the guy playing he can! I always thought that Gandalf could only do one action per round.

For the video check the link below, the bit you want starts at 8:30 and he goes pretty quick.

Well, when you play Gandalf, any responses to that effect trigger. Exhausting Gandalf is not part of the cost to use his response, the only prerequisite is that Gandalf must enter play. You can then exhaust him to commit to the quest, defend an attack, attack an enemy, etc. at the appropriate time.

Another question regards Ally Gandalf. It's in regards to what "in play" means. 

One of the choices you can choose when he enters play is to "deal 4 damage to 1 enemy in play". Does this apply to enemies in the staging area or only enemies engaged with you?

I wouldn't think so, but would just like to clarify.

 

Edit: Got 2 more.

- The shadow text for Pursued by Shadow [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Pursued-by-Shadow-Core] reads "Shadow: Defending player chooses and returns 1 exhausted ally he controls to its owner's hand. If he controls no exhausted allies, raise his threat by 3."

Now if I return that ally to my hand, does any damage on that ally remain, or does it get removed?

 

- On the second quest card [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Anduin-Passage-Core] of Journey Along the Anduin the text reads "Reveal 1 additional card from the encounter deck each quest phase. Do not make engagement checks during the encounter phase. (Each player may still optionally engage 1 enemy each encounter phase.)"

Does this mean you can only engage 1 enemy during the combat phase? Even if you would like to engage more. Because you would have to quest pretty well to overcome the amount of enemies and locations that would stack up in the staging area.

Any enemy in play, engaged with you, another player or in the staging area.

The damage gets removed when an ally is removed from play.

Yes, optional engagements are limited to one per player per encounter phase, unless there is a card saying otherwise like Halbarad hero (you can also use effect like TaAragorn, Son of Arnor or Knight of Minas Tirith to engage enemies outside the encounter phase). And yes, that's the difficulty of that stage, the piling up of enemies and locations, so you should get it over as soon as possible

Hmm, seems my deck needs some changes made, thanks.

You know what shadow card I hate, Despair [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Despair-Core], text instructs you to ignore a characters defence. I've had several heroes killed this way, and then it's game over. And I love defence!

If you return ally to hand, any damage gets removed.

You can optionally engage 1 enemy during the engagement phase, which is always your maximum for optional engagements unless you are using Hero Halbarad (he gives you two).  You don't automatically engage enemies at all via engagement checks, because that is skipped in stage 2.  But if you have other ways of engaging enemies (for example, by sneak attacking Son of Arnor in the combat phase after the enemy attacks phase is done), you can certainly do that.  Only engagement checks are affected.

Man, just starting to play Khazad-dum (Into the Pit) and got 2 terrible starts...

In the first game the first encounter card I drew was Crumbling Ruin [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Crumbling-Ruin-KD], which reads: "Each player must exhaust a character and discard the top card of his deck, if able. If the printed cost of the discarded card is equal to or higher than the remaining hit points of the exhausted character, discard the exhausted character."

And I drew a card that was equal, so I had to discard a hero. Didn't continue with that game...

Second game, the second encounter card I drew was Sudden Pitfall [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Sudden-Pitfall-KD], which reads: "The first player must discard 1 questing character he controls, if able. This effect cannot be canceled."

So again I had to discard a flippen hero!

So I guess my question isn't so much about the rules - but when you start a game and a hero dies or is discarded right at the beginning do you just start over?

Those 2 treacheries are stinkers though. They both had yellow borders so I hope there are not too many around otherwise it's game over if A Test of Will doesn't show up.

## 156 [Rouxxor on November 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3545648)

In both case another character could have take the hit instead of the hero. So if you want to prevent these an ally would be more useful than a test of will, since sudden pitfall (who come over in others scenario of the second cycle) can't be countered. Those kind of cards are also typical of what I dislike in the cycle 2 (that is the worst of the game to me, but I'm clearly an exception), and I found this kind of effect less and less present in the rest of the game.

Loosing a hero on the first few turns in often the sign of a needing restart, but I do have keep playing some to see if I'm able to win anyway, and manage to win some. Feel free to restart if you're not longer enjoying the game you are playing, no matter why this occur ;).

Good luck for your next games.

Yeah it seems sometimes the designers just go, "What is the worst possible Treachery we could give the player - let's go with that" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Treacheries which ruin a game in a single go... well let's just say I'm not a fan of them.

Well I came close on my first try of Into the Pit but failed at the last hurdle when a defending hero was killed when a shadow card gave an Orc +3 attack for a total of 6 attack! That was it from there onward.

Yes, some "Game Over" cards are really unpleasant. Like I said there would be less of them in the future. But the rest of the encounter cards of the cycle is mostly considered as easy compared to the rest of the game. So be prepared when you are moving to another cycle, especially if it is cycle 3. On the beginning playing and loosing every games I play at Heirs of Numenor made me think I got all wrong about building LOTR decks ^^. It help me to upgrade my skills :).

Usually. After the first few cycles, the designers moved away from feel-bad, insta-kill cards like these that give the players little choice in how to avoid, build around, or even cancel them.

This is good to know. I have decided to start from the beginning and bought some APs from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle and was curious about Khazad-dum so gave the first quest a go. But I was starting to think twice about buying anymore LOTR stuff, but if they improved on the game in future cycles then I will keep on buying. Heirs of Numenor is next (which I hear is quite hard) but at least you can still find APs for that cycle (it's near impossible to find AP's for the Dwarrowdelf  cycle, even at inflated prices they are mostly no where to be found).

I played a game of Into The Pit when I lost a hero in turn one thanks to Sudden Pitfall (I forgot it couldn't be cancelled), and we still won. But that was a two-player game. In solo I would probably start again immediately.

Heirs of Numenor is the low point of the cycles, but it's worth it.

## 163 [Rouxxor on November 25, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3546342)

To me Heirs of the Numenor was the top of my experience of LOTR. It ask me to really think about the game, to deckbuild better decks than I use to do before. There is better scenario since (they keep improving many things) but it was the moment where I go from "playing the new AP once with a friend" to "getting involved in the game and thinking about it diversity" due to the excitement of the challenge.

So, the success of Heir of Numenor it seem to depend of who was playing it ^^. To get a little more data I make a poll some years ago about what what cycles/AP do people like the most and Heirs of Numenor come right after The core set and Khazad-dum.

One question was 'which deluxe+cycle do you like the best, non-saga' (for people who have played several cycles).

Khazad-dum came in first, Grey-Havens a close 2nd. Lost Realm was a distant 3rd, with Heirs narrowly behind it.  Then core+Shadows of Mirkwood, then Voice of Isengard, then Harad.  Poll was out July 2018, which was just after Wilds was released, and some people voted for Wilds as well.

The final part of this doesn’t correspond with the Online Rules Reference booklet which states:

6.4a The active player (starting with the first player) chooses an eligible enemy that he or she is engaged with to resolve its attack. An eligible enemy is one that has not yet attacked this round and is still able to attack. 

Therefore an enemy that made an immediate attack before the combat phase cannot make another attack. It has already made an attack this round.

Is there something I am missing?

## 168 [PocketWraith on April 5, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284435-a-couple-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3669102)

Well, 6.3 on the same page also say that each enemy engaged with a player will get an opportunity to attack during the Combat phase, but no, I don't really think you're missing something in the text of the Rules Reference. However I am certain that if you submitted a rules question Caleb would confirm that immediate attacks do not prevent the enemy attacking normally in the Combat phase as well.

As a relevant precedent, players are also restricted to only declaring one attack against each enemy per round, but this limit is circumvented by card effects which grant attacks (like Quick Strike, Haldir, Hands Upon the Bow, etc). It makes sense that the same principle would apply to enemies - attacks triggered by card effects don't count as their one framework attack for the round.

Edit - And now I see this was answered properly in other threads.
