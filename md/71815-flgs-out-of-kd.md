I was a little bummed my FLGS  was out of KD when I went to pick it up today (I pre-purchased one from a shipment coming in later this week though happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]). I'm playing catch-up with the game (in order), purchasing ahead of my progress so I don't run out. Not much conversation here, just felt like writing something.

Same here, in terms of buying habits.  I bought the game when it came out, then it just sat on the shelf for awhile.  The g/f and I haven been going through it now- I'll probably pick up KD in a couple weeks.  Just thought I'd chime in :-)

 Yeah, my own flgs does not regularly carry LOTR (besides the core set) so I just special order a pack or two every month. It's tough being a nub, because you want the complete set but it takes time to enjoy each pack and, of course, lots of money.
