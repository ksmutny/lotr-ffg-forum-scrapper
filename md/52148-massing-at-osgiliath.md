I just now heard about Massing at Osgiliath. I am unfamiliar with the Print on Demand setup. Where will these be available for purchase? Also, do we have any estimate as to when they will be available? I don't want to miss out on any of the LotR LCG stuff!

 You can order it from the Shop link at the top of this site when it's available. I've also seen some of the other PoD products available for the same price from CCG Armory. But when it comes to PoD I'd just get it from the source. I don't think the shipping will be better elsewhere, and the price is hard to get lower.

That was the other question I forgot! Any word as to the pricing on this?

 None yet, but the other PoD items vary between $5-$15.

It's right on the navigation bar at the top. It's the "Shop" option.

Thank you for the SHOP link.  I don't know how I missed it.

From the descriptions found on ebay, the set will have 45 cards? I hope the PoD price won't be any higher than a normal chapter pack...

PoD is supposed to make it very cheap, so $10 might be possible. It'll be double that with shipping for me, but I haven't bought any of the on demand products yet, so I'm saving up products for a large order here :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
