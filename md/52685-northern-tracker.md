Not sure if this has been asked before but i was wondering if Northern Trackers were to complete multiple locations does the group recieve all the listed rewards.  For example "Mountains of Mirkwood"

Thnx in advance.

The answer to your question is: yes you do receive the benefits. The game term 'explored' means to place a number of Progress Tokens on a location card equal to the number on the left side of the card. Northern Tracker explores locations in that way, so the Response on Mountains of Mirkwood triggers.

See 'Enchanted Stream' theme above/below.  Cheers!
