I'm curious what you guys do with your expansion boxes.  For me, I use the whole box as dividers between encounter sets in a very big card storage box.  Some people cut out the front of the AP and use that as a divider but I use the whole box.  They are like free artwork dividers so that's why I do it.  For all the deluxe/Saga boxes, I gave the inside cardboard part to the ever chewing/gnawing gerbils in the house.  They made short work of that..... :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png] And I stacked the boxes of the deluxe/saga exp. in a corner. How about you guys?

I keep the adventures inside their own boxes, and use the boxes as dividers for the quests from the sagas and core within card collector boxes.

Can someone show some picks of those dividers? (Just curious)

I keep all of my encounter cards in their original boxes respectively. Therefore my LOTR LCG collection takes up a lot of space but I'm perfectly cool with that. For me I could never cut up any of the boxes, it would feel like I'm ruining something ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] but I certainly understand why many people do!

I haven't found any use for them yet. So far they're just occupying what could be emoty space.

I like boxes for some reason.

I never throw them out or cut them up.

Got a whole lot of em stored in my cellar. (Video games mostly)

To me, it's nice to grab a box once in a while and look at it.

Why people would cut them up is beyond me.

But hey, each to his own.

I drop them in the recycle bin. Don't have space to keep loads of cardboard boxes.

Destroying your LotR boxes? What blasphemy is this?!

I keep all of the boxes on a bookshelf. All of the cards I keep in big hardware boxes that work perfectly as card holders. I wish I could keep all of my cards in their original boxes, but because I use clear sleeves on all of them they don't fit.

Blasphemy indeed! ;-)

I stash mine in the Core/Expansion/Saga boxes and other other big game box I have lying around (mainly from FFG; anyone else notice they have this fascination of "bigger than needed" boxes...? >_> ). I can't see myself throw the AP boxes out. I'm kind of a pack rat anyhow lol

I hate the expansion boxes cause they're totally useless for storing cards. Yeah they're pretty but they're pretty impractical. It would be awesome if instead they would be like Mtg's fat packs, those are amazing for storing cards... Hmmm maybe I've found a use for the boxes...

I keep the adventure pack boxes in one, spare cards in another, the gencon packs in another and the rule sheets in the fourth. Black riders is still in it's own box and I dont have voice of isengard yet.

My three decks and all the game components and quest decks are in the coreset box.

They're really just lying around, at the moment. I wouldn't throw them away, though - the artwork is beautiful. I'm thinking about putting them up on the wall or something.

I put two expansions of encounter cards in one pack, and use the remaining packs for player cards. Haven't found a good use for the saga/deluxe boxes so far, though I sometimes use one for a single deck plus some scenarios, tokens and a threat counter when travelling.

You must be single?

My wife would never allow such a thing...

Here's an article about them on my blog: https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/encounter-card-dividers/ [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2013/11/02/encounter-card-dividers/]

Here's how I make them :



And here they are:

Awesome Kerstoid.

Now I wonder why I never thought about doing it like that. Too late now; most are in the bin.

Uh... I don't think I could ever force myself to cut the boxes...

I did the exact same thing as Kerstoid except I didn't cut all the boxes; I just used the whole AP as a divider.  Works fine.

I use them to keep their Encounter cards inside.

 

As for the Player cards of every exp/ap, I use deck boxes to store them.

Haha! I have a fiancée, actually, and her absolutely devastating the encounter deck with Gloin/Gimli/Bifur recently made me realise I made the right choice. But no, by "lying around" I mean lying around in my old hobby room in my parents' cellar. Yup, feel free to visualise the nerdiness... I keep my LotR and SW Lego there as well.

yeah, just keep them nicely lined up, with the ecounter cards inside...they look so lovely on my fireplace :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I immediately throw away the box and any inserts. All of the inserts are available in pdf form on the Support page for that game. I have my iPad next to me when I play, and have the rule book, FAQ, and every insert on that. It saves space and time.

An ipad isn't very thematic... Using paper accesories IS THE WAY to play LotR.

"What about that expansion box of yours? Is it staying?"

"Yes, yes. It's right over there on the fireplace."

"... no, wait; it's... here in my pocket... isn't that odd, now?"
