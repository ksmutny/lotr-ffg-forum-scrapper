At BGG among the many of the awesome things that site dose .. is host various game design contests… One of them is a contest to make a solitaire PnP (print and play) These games are all 100% free, you just print the PDFs and play them.

Anyway, the I was looking at these and found a 3rd prize winner was a Lord of the Rings Game. Check it out is is pretty neat.. basically it is a push your luck game, but it is free and LoTR themed … I think some people on this forum would like it… I did.
