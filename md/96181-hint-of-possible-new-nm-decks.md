If you go quick (maybe they change it in a couple of hours) to the news about NM decks, they announce 3 "new" quests that were already posted as Season 3 from 2013.

 

But in the end of that news, you can see an image with 3 NM packs never seen: the ones from the first Hobbit Saga Expansion.

 

Interesting stuff...

When I first tried Nightmare decks I didn't think they were for me. As the card pool has deepened I think they are a perfect way to keep old adventures competitive.

The page is showing the NM decks for the first Hobbit box for me.

I felt the same way with the NM decks, I was just so used to playing the old scenarios, but I think they are going to give this game a lot of depth, and they will be great to have especially as the card pool grows.  I think there real value will come when the game has run it's full course.  Having these will ensure many more years of game play even after there is no new content, although I dread that day.  These NM packs are certainly going to extend the life of this game for me even if I do not get to them right away they are an investment for the future, especially the scenarios that prove to nightmarish for right now.

You can still wait until they release them as POD expansions.

The quality of the POD cards is pretty low (not that the non-POD cards are much better....) The colors are off and the images not as sharp. If you buy the game night kits, are they just POD packs?

I'm really surprised they're doing The Hobbit next, I thought they'd be keeping to the cycles in order. I really don't think I need nm mode for the first round of Hobbit quests, as I found them far too crazy! Though I doubt I won't snap up everything released for this game  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

Cool. Now we can play some cool Hobbits tournaments and Company mode

I think the Hobbit saga is difficult enough, but this may be the first time I'm actually interested in nightmare decks.

I'm very interested to see if they're going to "fix" the riddle quest, which many players weren't too happy with.
