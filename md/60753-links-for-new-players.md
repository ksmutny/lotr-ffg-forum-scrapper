May I do some auto-promotion? happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Some time ago I created this effect-oriented turn sequence: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=595428 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=595428]

I hope this is useful to beginners.

Hey, Muemakan, just wanted to give you a tip in case you hadn't heard it, though you probably have. Instead of posting a new post each time you want to update the original post of the thread, next time you get into the edit mode where you can change the original post, copy that URL and email it to yourself or save it to a word processing file. If you ever need to update again, just past that URL into your browser and you should be able to update it directly without subsequent posts to your thread. (Although I suppose posting is nice because it bumps your thread and this is a good topic to have on the first page.)

That´s what I do. I never post new info in a new reply.

The posts without words are just to bump the thread, otherwise no player will see it.

Thanks for the input. By the way, feel free to add things to the thread. I will add it to the original post.

 I think it is time to update the Comprehensive Card List and Unofficial FAQ link. I think Kirk Bouer stopped updating his file (thanks for the great job) and new person happycatmachine decided to continue his work. New version of the file can be found at: 

javascript:void(0);/*1349171535022*/ [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/82879/comprehensive-card-list-and-unofficial-faq]

Please also thumb the file so it gets on the first page of the files for LOTR:LCG so new players can find updated version.
