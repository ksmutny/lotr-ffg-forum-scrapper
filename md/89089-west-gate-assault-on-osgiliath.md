Am I missing something here?  Why would you ever use that action?  I would think you want to minimize the amount of locations around.

 

FYI, the action reads:  'If there is no active location, search encounter deck and discard pile for an Osgiliath location and add it to the staging area.'  Then, make West Gate the active location.

 

Why wouldnt you just travel there normally?

Hi Spurries

 

Well the only way to finish this quest is by progressing through locations. This action allows you to place West gate as active and go get the 1 threat location that also has surge. (which is progressed by killing enemies)

 

So it's a great effect.  If you quest effectively and destroy 2 enemies you gain 2 locations that turn!

I read it as when you draw it from the encounter deck, if you have no active locations at the moment, make West gate the active location and find another location to put in the staging area. You can't choose but are forced to do it like this IF there's no active location when drawn.

No It's an action.

 

The way you perceive it would be a Forced effect.

I didnt think it was forced(knew it was optional).  I just didnt see a reason to use it, but makes sense now.

 

PS just played this two handed, epic quest.  Had to explore literally every location in the game, final threat was at 43 and 49.

 

Archery card that adds the archery=X where X is number of locations you control was interesting haha.

Folks, I think they just forgot the first line on this card: "The players cannot travel here."

That's the only way it would really make sense...

It makes fine sense.

The action isn´t a travel action, which means you can travel to it outside that phase.

If you want to have an active location at the start of the game you can use the West Gate action to make it active.

Would also work if you place enough tokens on the active location with something like Legolas and wanted a new active location for your Blades of Gondolin to target.

Only if the blades are on a different Hero and that Hero also kills an enemy.

Yes of course. Your point being? :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

His point is:

 

If Blades are, in example given, on another hero than Legolas, because if they are on Legolas, then the progress tokens must be put on quest card. (assuming that Legolas response clears active location)

 

You do not have an action window between Legolas and Blades responses.

I realize that is the point that was tried for.

 

The all too obvious response would be: "place blades of Gondolin on another hero or have a readying effect"
