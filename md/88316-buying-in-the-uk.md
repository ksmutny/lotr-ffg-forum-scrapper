I had to wait over a month to bag a copy of Amon Din in the UK, but assault on osgiliath was available from my supplier the day after it went up on the FFG website? Anyone else in the UK having inconsistent experiences with supply?

Yes! I thought it was a bit weird. Two months for Druadan Forest, a month for Amon Din, but Osgiliath is available this Wednesday according to the store I use, but was ready for pre-order on Friday. On another thread someone mentioned there being problems with the stock received from FFG in the UK (was it a flood? Can't remember now), although I have had no problems with any of the other LCGs getting here on (reasonable) time. 

 

Hopefully it won't happen again, though! Amazon has Black Riders available from August 29th, and I hope that is the case!

I think it's more of a case of the British distributor being awful than anything else.

Being honest, I actually think this will be seen every time a new something comes out for this game. Not just in UK of cause. You had some bad luck the last two times as we in Norway for example had them on time. Now for the third one the Norwegian distributor suddenly had sold out without anyone being sold!?! This tells me that it's a matter of what distributor gets to order how many first from FFG. Those that comes first get the packages first while the rest might wait a "little" longer. I don't know this as a fact of cause but sound like it to me. Just order from MM. You get the best price and no later than a week after release. It's even cheaper for me to get it from MM in US to Norway than buing them in Norway!!

In general with this product line I have found the release schedule to be fairly good in terms of when we get it after the USA - usually it's available to UK-based eBay sellers (these are UK shops, not individuals) about a week after the US, which is fair enough. Occasionally there is a blip - the Druadan Forest being the biggest one (and Amon Din less so). From posts on here though it sounds like there was some issue with the UK products (damage to the crate/items?) so in a sense it's understandable, just a matter of being patient, just wish it could have been reported somewhere official (even FFG's own site since it is their product, not just the UK supplier) and not left to us to guess.

 

One a good note, it seems to be back on track.

I saw Assault on Osgiliath was available after returning from holiday on Thursday, ordered it from my usual eBay seller (a UK store) and got it by Saturday.

 

Hope the missing POD nightmare pack comes available again, I'll order all three from FFG when it does.
