We can open a new post with the next theme: the most treachery hated card.

 

In all the game, we have very bad experiencies about one treachery, and you finally hate that card a lot.

 

Which is this one, or various? (without thinking about Test of Will neither Eleanor :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

 

My vote is for:

 

ffg_wind-whipped-rain-ohauh.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_wind-whipped-rain-ohauh.jpg]

 

You are preparing the combat against trolls and just before it is revealed: aaagh!

I don't know that it's the worst treachery by any stretch, but I really, really hate Southron Support. Doomed 3 is often annoying enough, as it shows up in quests like Into Ithilien where I'm trying to carefully engage enemies when I can handle them, but then adding two more? Argh. I always seemed to be doing well when this would turn up, and it almost always turned things against me. Just a nightmare of a card!

Anything from Rhosgobel is nasty, basically got fed up with that quest.  With an encounter deck so big, one would think I wouldn't get an Exhaustion and Swarming Insects within the 3rd turn of every game I played.  Woof.

I vote for:

 

ffg_the-power-of-mordor-hon.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_the-power-of-mordor-hon.jpg]

 

Not because it is necessarily the nastiest, but because:

- it makes a complete mess of the Siege of Cair Andros if it reshuffles the locations

- it's not clear how it works with the Captains/To the Tower in Morgul Vale

 

For most horrible (with more than one player, anyway):

In no particular order; though sleeping sentry is probably the worst in the game.

I choose these as they also have horrible shadow effects.

Yep. This card is horrible for all solo players. But that's not all. Even worse:

 

ffg_the-masters-malice-hon.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_the-masters-malice-hon.jpg]    plus    ffg_orc-vanguard-hon.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_orc-vanguard-hon.jpg]

 

 

Why are both these cards in the same set? If you don't have a mono tactics deck, one of these two will punish you in a way that ususally means "game over". Drawing the Orc Vanguard early in the game doesn't give you many options to counter it. Because you can't play no cards no more.

 

As for The Master's Malice - why did't they word it "deal 1 damage plus X where X is the number of players"?

Sleeping Sentry is actually in dude: if you dont have any exhausted character, the second part not triggers. So if you see it is coming (by scrying), you could make the choice of loss the quest no commiting nobody (or use unexpected courage, etc) to avoid this treachery.

Not the worst, but one that drives me up the wall. It always seems to show up for me towards the end when I'm trying to knock out one last stage.

I think people have covered most of the super evil treacheries in the game.  So I'll pitch in to add some of the most annoying:

How many times have you gotten saddled with two copies of Watchful Eyes in the first round?  Ughh.  And Necromancer's Reach, all that little plink-plink-plink damage adds up, and makes you afraid to commit Hobbits to the quest.

This card is very nasty. Dificult that it happens, but, for example, last time i played in Redhorn Gate, it did:

 

ffg_avalanche-trg.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_avalanche-trg.jpg]

 

When it forces to you to pass to 3a-3b (and Caradhras becomes active location -because Caradhras makes -1wp to each commited character, and 3b writes that all characters with 0wp is discarded). It is very bad, because you loss all characters that has not 2wp at least.

 

PD: the idea is very good, and it seems real. When you are in the climb of the mountain, and it gets an avalanche, almost all characters die. Yes, real.

this has been answered by Caleb:

 

You count the Captains - but they cannot be removed - so it makes for an extra card revealed when this treachery shows up! i.e., you count the captain - but don't remove them.

Wow, captain counts... i didnt know it.

The necromancer's reach is the earliest card to give that "be careful, that one sucky card is in this encounter deck" feel. Treachery that ends the game right there, particularly punishing the multi sphere solo deck, is annoying, but I find I wouldn't really lose without it which is important. I think this is a big part as to why there is so little treachery cancellation, and probably why there shouldn't be. That said, orc vanguard and southron support both feel like total disasters every time they pop out.

I have seen this ruling referred to online, but I haven't actually seen the ruling itself - do you have a link? Presumably you would also count "To the Tower", by this ruling, since it is also in the staging area and cannot leave it.

 

I struggle to understand the rationale of this ruling giving the "Then" clause for the second sentence.

Caleb answers by e-mail, so there would never be a link.

 

I e-mailed him to ask about To The Tower, specifically, and will post his response once I hear back.

 

The "equal number" part can be confusing; does it refer to the equal number you counted or the equal number you shuffled? Caleb ruled it's equal to the number you counted, not shuffled. The card could be clearer, for sure.

 

My rule of thumb is, when in doubt, go for what makes it more difficult for the players. There are lots of folks trying to contort cards to make them do what they want it to do (Hands Upon the Bow is a prime example), or even this one. So, basically, if it makes it harder for me, I'll typically go with that interpretation. If it gets clarified that I was wrong later, all the better! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I meant a forum link where someone had posted an email from Caleb - the normal way for these rulings to disseminate into the community.

 

I too have submitted a request for a ruling and will also post any response.

 

Regarding the "Then" clause, I was referring to this from the FAQ: "If a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve. "

 

It seems to me that the first clause fails because you can't shuffle in Captains/To the Tower - therefore the "Then" clause does not resolve.

 

This whole issue is very murky at the moment (see the "Ered Nimrais" thread in the Rules forum).

Yeah those two used to be really high on my list of treacheries I really wanted to avoid but these days I seem to be able to handle them ok.

 

I think that most of my least liked individual treacheries cards have already been highlighted... except for local trouble:

ffg_local-trouble-hon.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_local-trouble-hon.jpg]  

At the time when I first encountered this treachery card I was massively favoring decks that included Elrond & Vilya & 2x unexpected courage to ready him for questing and defending and putting a card into play.

 

But its often the combinations of cards that really hurts... like getting both Necromancer's Reach and Dol Guldur Orcs together - insta killing Eowyn far too many times in the early days!

 

1) - The Masters malice (so often been game over, thanks for coming. Unless mono sphere)

2) - The power of Mordor (the times its shown up have been brutal! or confusing with captains... edit reading dain's post adds to brutality even if less confusing)

3) - Local trouble (I love Elven decks this sucks for Elrond or any other Hero that you want to ready a lot)

4) - Sleeping Sentry (though have seldom come across it)

5) - Wind-Whipped rain (only this low as I don't play the saga its in much... think my lip quivered the first time I lost all my attachments)

While I know you don't believe me (yet), that is his ruling (I just can't find the e-mail). And the first clause can be satisfied - but the quest card trumps all for those cards that can't leave play. I just really don't see it as that confusing.

 

Now, if he says you count a captain but not To The Tower...then that really is confusing! Hahaha.

...and having this card playing multiple times due to a certain 'Lieutenant of mordor' being one of the new cards is even less fun!

Are you thinking about the card immunity fiasco?  I'm totally fine with Hands being illegal against immune cards, it just bugs the hell out of me that Quick Strike (copy paste of same wording) is not illegal.  Text is all-important.  Anyway, it makes it worse that there was a ruling last year that Hands WAS a legal play against immune enemies, which is more consistent with how the card is written (or cards, since QS and Hands are written the same).

 

But maybe you're not talking about this at all... it's just a festering open wound in my legalistic approach to the interpretation of card text.

I think that consistency is important really important. I do not like having, what now appears, to be inconstant rules for the same text with the cards Quick Strike & Hands upon the bow...

I'm actually not a fan of the "immune to player card effects" at all. I think a better approach would be to introduce specific keywords that nullify certain effects, but not all of them. "Relentless" could prevent players from stopping an enemy from attacking, "Resilient" could make an enemy immune to direct damage, "Cunning" would mean an enemy could only be attacked through the declare attacks step of normal combat, etc. This might be more complex, but it would make enemies feel more distinct and avoid crazy ruling confusion. It's too late to do it now, but maybe for the future...

You should put it in that other thread as well so all the "then" bollocks is in one location.

 

> I'm actually not a fan of the "immune to player card effects" at all. I think a better approach would be to introduce specific keywords that nullify certain effects, but not all of them.

Problem is we have a ton of cards that do not have these limitations. So unless they do a mass errata the old pre-trait specific cards will be bonkers powerful in relation to the new ones. This could lead to more "must include" cards making decks even more alike.

 

Also a trait limiter on a card could limit the use vs new quests that might not have that location or monster type.

 

 

> quest card trumps all for those cards that can't leave play. I just really don't see it as that confusing

 

Yes this is correct.

 

 

> My rule of thumb is, when in doubt, go for what makes it more difficult for the players. There are lots of folks trying to contort cards to make them do what they want it to do (Hands Upon the Bow is a prime example), or even this one. So, basically, if it makes it harder for me, I'll typically go with that interpretation. If it gets clarified that I was wrong later, all the better! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I completely agree here as well. People like to bend the rules into whatever they think is best and while the game is a co-op so it doesn't matter like it dose in a competitive card game, I think this is still a real issue with rule interpretation.

 

When in doubt take the worst option.

Totally agree. It sucks that we have all these cool cards with cool effects that would allow you to outfox and defeat the Witch-King or a Nazgul, only to have him be immune to literally every effect you have except damage. I understand "Cannot have attachments" more so than the immune to player card effects one.

I think this is one of the "worst".. not that I would use that term. Still this one will end the game for most players most of the time if you haven't got a cancel ready. This results in 7-10 dmg on one of each players heroes.. assuming they are not tapped.. otherwise it is completely undefended.

 



----------------------------------------

 

This is one of my most hated though. I really like the Steward's Fear quest. With this card if you do not have the cancel and for some reason your not running condition removal (shock) your looking at some massive threat gain. I find this really stressful and it gets under my skin. Even if you have condition removal and you can't stop it, every draw when you can not fix the problem becomes more and more frustrating.

 

+1 threat on Tap and Untap and triggered ability? wow

 

med_local-trouble-hon.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_local-trouble-hon.jpg]

 

Side note.. do you think effects like Dain's buff or Thalin's dmg, or Dunhere's thing.. all those card texts that are not action or response but "always on" also trigger this? I'm thinking no.. but what do you guys think? The word "triggers" says NO, but the word "ability" says YES.

I think NO - going by rulebook p.23 ("These effects have no bold trigger, as they are always active"). This would also allow certain effects to operate while characters are unconscious in Flies and Spiders.

'Triggers' is about active actions or responses. Passive text doesn't count: it doesn't triggers.

yes.. that is true.. but not my point. There is no doubt what ruling is. the POINT is that is it murky wording.

 

We all know what a trigger is... but we also all know what a ability is. So why would you put both words on the same card. It is just retarded.

 

A Passive ABILITY

A Triggered ABILITY

 

It is just a silly thing to put on a card.. why make it confusing at all... for while I and others might not be confused.. I guarantee other are.

 

THAT is the point.. that is the joke. I'm not trying to start a rule discussion here... it is a joke.. Things are always way funnier when you have to explain them.

@Boored, as for immunity and «then» I agree with you, as for local trouble it's pretty straighforward. «Trigger an ability» is exatly what it say on the tin... putting both word is not retarded, it's just the right way to exclude passive abilities...

 

I vote for watcher in the wood.

I mostly play in 3-4 players game, and when you have 20 characters questing wich is not that hard in 4 players, revealing this card is simply a Game Over. And even in first turn, having at least 6 characters commited is barely the minimum, and it ruins most of the combat phase...

For the most part I don't mind the treachery cards - there are two I hate, though: Sleeping Sentry and The Masters Malice. Both have the potential to either take you out instantly, or severely wreck your board position so the game is unwinnable.

It's the Shadow effect on Sleeping Sentry that I hate - it just breaks the game. You need to exhaust characters to do anything, so wrecking your board for using a basic mechanic of the game is bad design.

The Masters Malice is crippling if you aren't playing monosphere. And yet, playing more than one sphere is a key component of building balanced decks. One or two damage would be bad enough, three is enough to kill most allies and a lot of heroes.

I don't mind other cards that mean you have challenging play decisions, like the ones that become condition attachments, but cards like these two that penalise you for using basic elements of the game are poor design.

Hi Matthew,

The Power of Mordor should read: 

"When Revealed: Count the number of encounter cards in the staging area and shuffle them into the encounter deck. Reveal an equal number of cards from the encounter deck and add them to the staging area. This effect cannot be canceled."

It should not use the word 'Then'. That will be corrected in the next FAQ.

Without the word 'Then', The Power of Mordor interacts with To The Tower and a Captain enemy like this:

-You count the number of encounter cards in the staging area, including To The Tower and the Captain enemy.

-Shuffle all the cards counted into the encounter deck, except To The Tower and the Captain enemy.

-You reveal the number of encounter cards that you counted and resolve their staging.

This does make The Power of Mordor a nastier treachery card in The Morgul Vale than in any previous scenario, since you are in a way revealing 2 additional encounter cards. However, it seemed fitting to us that The Power of Mordor should be stronger when you are in fact on the very doorstep of Mordor in that scenario.

Cheers,

Caleb

More votes for Wind-Whipped Rain (run very attachment heavy decks...), Sudden Pitfall and Local Trouble. Masters Malice is always horrid too.....

Really wish there was ever ever so slightly more treachery cancellation/manipulation... even if it was just a single extra card or a third copy of A Test of Will in the core... I know too much would ruin the game but to me treacheries are usually the nastiest encounter cards and its so painful smashing through a quest and just one single treachery completely destroys you when nothing else could..... for me wind-whipped rain and Sudden Pitfall are good examples..

Southron Support drives us mad. Not only does it give us two new enemies, in most of the encounter decks there aren't even any particularly weak Harad enemies to pull! And then 3 doomed on top, in quests that like to pile on the threat and/or punish you for having high threat? Oooh, naaaaasty!

 

I kinda understand the Doomed 3 because it makes the card relevant in solo/when cancelled, but anything that resolves for 2+ non-trivial enemies shouldn't really have a threat boost on top! Hmm, maybe the text could have "Then, each player reduces their threat by the number of cards added by this effect"...

Good catch! That quest is hard enough in nightmare and you already lose a villager every turn if you don't reveal an extra encounter card during staging but no there just has to be this awful treachery/condition attachment as well.

Thematically what the hell is going on? I get that it sort of represents the various survivors of Amon Din being split apart and you therefore lose tokens from rescued villagers as some survivors split off and get lost or rescued by others or whatever however in the quest whenever villager tokens are discarded from a location, OBJECTIVE, or quest stage that token is then placed on dead villagers..... so not only would this card make you lose a token on rescued villagers each and every turn but you also gain one on dead villagers each and every turn from this effect. Do you think this is actually a mistake by the designers? It seems to me like this card should represent losing a token off rescued villagers but in no way should equate to more dead villagers as well....

Unless these two armoured guards are actually dark men fighting for Sauron who are pretending to be saviours but actually killing or enslaving these rescued villagers? 

 

Doesn't make sense mechanically or thematically and is certainly a very powerful and nasty treachery.

I really fear the bodyguards of Morgul Vale. It's very creepy. The most creepy encounter card to me

You're right! I did forget! But now that you mention it, I remember one time I was a turn away from victory and I got those back to back for like a 30 threat increase. That one is a doozy!

Chill Fog is pretty rough in multi-player.

 

On a side note - I've asked this before, but what's the best way to post images here? Seems I am not simply able to copy an image and then post it into the reply.

in the actual text etc toolbar when you type out a post there is a button on the second row simply titled "image".

You can chuck the link to your image in there to include it in a post.
