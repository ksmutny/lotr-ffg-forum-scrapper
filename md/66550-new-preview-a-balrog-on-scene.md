… no player cards but an intense concept of the main antagonist previewed

 I'm assuming we'll get some cards in this pack to help deal with this beast. I'm very curious as to what the ultimate quest goal will be, I'm assuming surviving the Balrog long enough to escape or some similar idea, since we obviously can't kill it.

there may be a way to get rid of it yet, the announcement for the pack mentioned the ring of power…

 No beating around the bush there. 

You want a preview? BAM! Durin's Bane! 

 

 

 

 

Fly you fools!

A nasty foe, indeed.  The artwork looks fantastic!

And some of us thought being attacked by a Hill Troll first turn was bad…

It looks like the continuity problem of killing the Balrog won't arise, at least. Though the remarks in the article about continuity don't really address the concerns that were raised. The article speaks of continuity between the 3 Dwarrowdelf quests and the KD cycle, but the concern was about continuity between Dwarrowdelf/KD and the established story of the book.

Continuity between the established story and the game can be maintained by anyone that cares about such things - just don't take any of the fellowship characters and don't allow Gandalf in the decks - then you have a group encountering Durin's bane that wouldn't necessarily be available to tell the fellowship what to expect.

Specifically take the 3 non-canonical characters and then lose the last scenario; then you have no problems at all. You can't expect cannon to always be maintained if you want to present agency and choice to the player. For the game to maintain continuity it only has to be possible to play through it and have one outcome that fits established cannon.

These points are fair, given the situation. However, I think the concern was more as to whether it was the best decision in the first place to send the game into areas and storylines that so closely match events from the book.

Yes.

And I think the concerns were both, even between Khazad and Dwarrodelf, so they did address one of those.

With regards to continuity I personally don't mind concessions/sacrifices to made here and there.  Infact I would pretty much expect it to maintain variety/choice for the player.  I would only ever have an issue if FFG ever tried to outright change major laid-down events in the book.

on this subject i wonder what will happen when/if we meet sauron…if we did what would happen? would we be going to spy up on barad dur? freeing a prisoner? trying to steal back a ring of power? (unlikely given the falseness of this)

i cant wait for mordor, but mordor and sauron is the area the devs will have to tread most carefully as they are indeed dealing with lore breaking aspects

im not sure though, given the 'newline cinema' style eye on the back of the cards, that they will have us meet him, as they may be under the 'false' idea of him not existing in body…

it also raises the issue of if you meet the man (maiar) himself, every other quest will just be an anti climax in comparision…though i cannot see them ending  the 'land of shadow' cycle any other way - they do the balrog in khazad dum, they do sauron in mordor

New hero, Isildur, will have following ability:

If Isildur deals any damage to Sauron, while Narsil is attached to Isildur, then Sauron is destroyed.

its funny that the quest card in that article talks about snowdrifts. it seems like we're going to come out of the mines, only to head back into them again to meet durin's bane

As far as I got it, the displayed quest card was from already existing scenario, not from the upcoming one.

It was obviously a joke, but feel free to express anything about it that you feel.

The quest card in the article is from Redhorn Gate.

I'm really looking forward to an expansion series focused on Helm's Deep.  It would give the tactics sphere the revival it needs along with some awesome scenarios for epic battles.  I know you are focused on the theme/lore aspects…but from a card game perspective…oh man!  This would be a fantastic series of quests/battles.

yes, those would be good- perhaps we could finally get some good non-spirit rohan allies, tactics ones that could help in the figh
