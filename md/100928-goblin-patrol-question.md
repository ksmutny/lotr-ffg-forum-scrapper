My son and I are really novice at this game, and we've been stumped by the Goblin Patrol card.  Maybe we are over thinking this, but we are really confused. 

 

So the card has each player search for enemies from both the discard pile and encounter deck.  Anything you take out of the encounter deck then just gets chucked into the discard pile again?  So really, the only thing you might have to face is a Patrol Leader, if there was one in the discard pile?  If I'm reading that right, what's the point?  Why not just throw a Patrol Leader out there from the discard pile and be done?  Also, once you clear any remaning enemies out, or if none exist, you just move on right? 

 

Just a little confused here....

Hum. I seem to understand what you were thinking.

The "forced" effect happen for "revealed" cards, and when you search for the enemies cards of the "when revealed" effect, it instructs to "add them to the staging area", without them being "revealed".

Short question about Goblin Patrol,

what happens to a Goblin Follower revealed from the encounterdeck while the Goblin Patrol is active?

 

I would say the Goblin Follower will engage the last player because this enemy will not go directly into the staging area.

Card Text:
 
When Revealed: Each player must search the encounter deck and discard pile for 1 enemy of his choice, and add it to the staging area. One choice must be Patrol Leader, if able.

Forced: After an enemy is revealed from the encounter deck, discard it instead of adding it to the staging area.

If there are no enemies in play, immediately advance to the next stage of the scenario. (Players can also advance by placing 11 progress tokens on Goblin Patrol.)

 

 

The enemies (of wich one has to be a Patrol Leader) are "added" by you to the staging area, i.e. not "revealed from the encounter deck". So those enemies are not discarded right away.

Well, I believe that the Goblin Follower will be discarded as it is revealed from the encounterdeck after all.

But the Goblin Follower does not goes to the staging area, It is placed directly engaged with the last player and "Goblin Patrol" reads: After an enemy is revealed from the encounter deck, discard it instead of adding it to the staging area.

But when it appears it is "Revealed by the Encounter Deck" and the forced effect of the questcard is that any enemy is discarded right away so I believe that this forced effect overrides the text on the Goblin Follower.

So, if the forced effect overrides the text on the Goblin Follower it will override all "When revealed"-effects, right?

 

 

FAQ:

Q: When an enemy makes an attack as part of its “when revealed” effect, is that enemy in the staging area?

A: No. Enemies are added to the staging after resolving their “when revealed” effects. An enemy that makes an attack as part of its “when revealed” effect, is not in the staging area or engaged with the defending player unless a card effect says it is.

 

 

It's not the same situation but the answer reads that when revealed effects will trigger before a card is added to the staging area, so the Goblin Follower will engage the last player. After that, if the card would normally added to the staging area, discard it. The Goblin Follower wouldn't go to the staging area, so no discard.

Adding to the staging area and revealing are 2 distinct ways cards arrive in the staging area. "Reveal" is a game mechanic. If you were to reveal cards during the quest phase for example and they are enemies, they get discarded via the quest card forced effect. But if it says search for an enemy and add it to the staging area you still add it. It isn't considered revealed though so any when revealed effects are not triggered.

Likewise if you use the cave torch during this quest and discard an enemy, it is still added via cave torch effect because it wasn't revealed.

Reveal, add, and discard are all game mechanics. Just because something shows up off the top if the deck doesn't mean it was revealed.

@midwestborn86: thanks for your detailed clarifications about 'reveal', 'add' and 'discard' .. but that was not my question.

 

The question is, when does a 'when reveald'-effect from a enemy trigger and when the enemy will be discarded by the forced effect of the questcard 'goblin patrol'.

When revealed only triggers when "revealed" so adding a card or discarding it will not trigger the when revealed. If it is revealed during goblin patrol you discard it instead of revealing it so it goes right to discard

> Hi Jan,
> 
> The Forced effect on Goblin Patrol is what we call a ‘replacement’ effect because it uses the word ‘instead.’ In order for a replacement effect to trigger, the effect that it is replacing must first attempt to resolve. In this case, an enemy that is revealed from the encounter deck and is about to be added to the staging area is replaced by placing that enemy in the discard pile instead.
> 
> However, Goblin Follower’s ‘when revealed’ effect has it enter play engaged with the last player. That means it was not about to be added to the staging area, which means the replacement effect on stage 2B is not triggered. In short, the Goblin Follower will enter play engaged with the last player unless its ‘when revealed’ effect is canceled. If its ‘when revealed’ effect is canceled, then it would be added to the staging area and the forced effect on 2B would discard it instead.

So, Question is answered.
