So, i havn't played the game from about the 3rd pack in darowdelf… just started again for somthing to do and forget a lot of it all..

The action window thign in the rules isn't correct is it? I remeber there was a revised verison but I can nto seam to find it. Is the entire combat phase is an action window right? Like you can defend one monster, do a UC and defend a diffrent monster and stuff like that?

Also, with Will of the West… what is teh timing sequence of that again? Dose it enter the discard pile after it resolves? I think it dose… like it dose not recure itself dose it?

Hey man! Glad to see you. It was your YouTube video that made me dig this out of the garage! Those videos are the best lotr ones I have seen.

Be a while before I am caught up. I'm up to date on the card pool and working on the nightmare decks. I've got some proxies made up.

Dain has lived up to our predictions hasn't he!

Yes, almost the entire combat phase is green. The only red window is the very first step when you're dealing the shadow cards.

I did a longer break (been busy, got Mage Knight), but now I'm paying from time to time. The new cycle seems to be very promising, I am so anxcious to play with these Outlanders and Tactics and so on. Unfortunatly I'll have to wait until June and July before I can get my hands on Doorstep and Steward's Fear.

No, I meant Mage Knight:

It has a very good solo mode!

yeah i have both games + the expantions for them.. but just thought mage wars was more like a traditional card game is all… I agree though Mage Knight is one of the best solo boardgames ever made. Try teh expantion, it removes teh dummy player.
