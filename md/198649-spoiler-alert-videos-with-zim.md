Hi Guys! I've just started a new video series I call "Spoiler Alert!". In these videos, I take a look at some content released for this game (and potentially others in the future) that give a glimpse into the future and have my say about them. First up is a video for the Temple of the Deceived [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/1/6/temple-of-the-deceived/] article.

I'm not seeing any replies or comments, so I wanted to ask: are people interested in this story of thing, or should I be sticking to the custom card reviews?

Hmm.  Spoilers - and really any form of speculation - benefit greatly from more of a discussion format.  It's fun to theorize about how cards will work, then supplement or make fun of other people's ideas.  So a solo format is putting you at a disadvantage compared to similar discussions that we already get from Cardboard of the Rings, Grey Company, or forums.  Personally, one spoiler segment on CotR gives me plenty of analysis and I'm not really itching for more content.

 

The video isn't really doing much for you either, considering it's mostly just a shot of you talking.  The free form pontificating can also drag and have a lot of lulls that make it hard to stay interested.  If you continue with this idea, a podcast might be the better format.

 

Either way, thanks for contributing to the community.  If nothing else, it's nice to see and hear other people on the forums!  I always figured you looked like Gollum.

Yea, I don't look like Gollum, but i can do his voice pretty well...

Maybe I'll try to get Bork into the mix for these videos and see what can come from some 2-person discussion.

You mean you just like to watch people play the game? Wouldn't you rather just play it yourself? =D I always find it interesting to me how I'll waste time watching Seastan play instead of just playing on my own since I'm so far behind in actually using the new cards and quests.

Makes me think of this video, which I watched right before seeing Les Mis and I couldn't keep from laughing during Anne Hathaway's heartfelt performance.

P.S., how do you embed a video on these forums?

I just put the YouTube URL in and it automatically embedded it

Attempt number 2: spoiler alert video for the Sailing Out of Mithlond article:





Hopefully the second person being along helps make this more interesting to watch.

I think it needs to be the youtu.be shortened version of the URL

I shortened the videos considerably. Let me know if that's better...
