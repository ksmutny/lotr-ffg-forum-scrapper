I'm beginning my first attempt at deck building.  It's going to be a spirit heavy deck.  Having played through the first two scenarios of the game with all four decks now I found I did the best with the spirit deck.  My final scores for the first two campaigns were 24 and an ASTONISHING 7 respectively.  I accomplished this last score with a bit of luck from the greeting of the galadhrim.  It showed up twice in my hand and as such i was able to lower my starting threat of 24 down to 14.  My first leg of the quest took me a while.  Not one, but TWO hill trolls showed up.  However my threat was so low they didn't find me interesting enough to attack.  Gandalf made multiple appearances thanks to stand and fight and lucky draws.  In the end I had two hill trolls and a Marsh Adder to add to my trophy pile.  Combine those factors with a copious amount of allies allowing me to do exact damage to the trolls and I was able to finish with the above score!  I <3 spirit!

stand and fight dose not work on neutral ally.. but yeah threat management is probably the most powerful effect.. many of the so called hard quest like audin and carrock are 100% win ratio if you have a good threat management deck. Try using Dunhere as well to attack into tehy staging area....

BTW it is hard to give deck advise if we do nto know your card pool

first sorry to bear bad news but Stand and fight cant be used on neautral allies

however it sound like a pretty good start apart from that!

 I'm going to give myself the win and the score for a couple of reasons.  Forgive me if I don't give the proper name for the cards in my following explaination, I'm at work and on my phone so I don't have a deck reference to look up the names.  First, I really had a perfect storm of cards both in the encounter deck and in my player deck.  Ally-wise I ended up with 2 Gandalfs, 3 Lorien Guides, and 2 Northern Trackers very early.  With these allies and a +1 willpower attachment on Eowyn, a refresh attachment on Eleanor, and Dunhere picking off everything but the trolls in the staging area I was pretty much able to take on everything but the trolls.  Then I ended up getting The Banks of
The Anduin location card which pretty much allowed me pool resources and draw card after card including a few Wandering Took to use as cannon fodder against the trolls.  My counting the game as a win and keeping the score revolves around drawing Will of the West which after I used the Gandalfs to cut down the troll's health to 1 apiece allowed me to shuffle them back into my deck.  I had so many cards in play that it wouldn't have taken me long to draw them again along with the other copy of will of the west.
