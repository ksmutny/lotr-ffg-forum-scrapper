 The card game is supposed to take place between The Hobbit and The LOTR. Does this mean there's a chance of having events like the White Council against The Necromancer?

That would be really cool, especially since the upcoming Hobbit movies are rumored to cover the Mirkwood events in some detail.

 Nevermind, I found the answer to my own question:

This game sounds pretty cool. I especially like the fact that it's co-op.

Yea a scenario that you must sneak and find out that the Necromancer is Sauron.

Oh i forgot this is Gandalf's joblengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

I'm all about Dul Guldur right now.  I'm already excited about the third scenario of the core set at Dul Guldur. But I totally hope we'll be going back there, maybe with Gandalf and Galadriel to kick some ass! I also hope that The Hobbit movie will take us there!

Gandalf and Galadriel are my two favorite characters.I hope FFG will give us Galadriel in an early sceanrio.

As for the Hobbit movie i think Peter Jackson will focus more at Bilbo and the 13 Dwarves  but we can allways hope gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Timeframe is clarified as well in the rulebook. It is between the 111th birthday party and Frodo and Sam leaving the Shire. So its a number of years past the end of the Hobbit.

In that case hasn't the last meeting of the White Council, and Sauron being revealed as the necromancer in Dul Guldor and returning to Mordor long since happened?

Yeah, good point. So this must not be the Necromancer build up but the later build up getting ready for the war in the north. Sauron sends a Nazgul to Dol Guldur during this period, I believe, to get ready for the war against Thranduil, Lorien and Erebor. That is a shame, I was hoping we'd get to participate in the raid on Dol Guldur by Gandalf and the White Council.

That's correct he sends Khamul, the second Nazgul to Dol Guldur to "reopen the doors" so to speak.

Yes that all sounds right.

So it would seem the first cycle of adventure packs will be our first chance to actually take over the roles from a significant event from the actual lore.

The hunt for Gollum and his imprisonment with the elfs in Mirkwood. Interestingly how close does this happen to Frodo's 50th birthday and him setting off from Bag End?  I assumed it was pretty close as Legolas is at Rivendel to let Elrond know he's escaped.

I assume this means that the expansions won't be moving forward in time from one to the other through the 17 year period.

Also the Rules say that the deluxe expansions will introduce new areas, and the adventure pack that follows I assume will also be based in those regions. So I guess we could be seeing events that "actually" happened concurrently in later sets.
