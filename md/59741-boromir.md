I just picked up The Dead Marshes, and therefore just got Boromir.  He looks like a really bad card.  His threat level being 11 and having to raise your threat by 1 every time you use him.  If his threat was lower it might make up for that.  Anyway, does anyone use him?  I'm wondering what his advantages are.

Also, with Frodo's avoiding damage, is that compulsory or optional?

You do not pay 1 threat when you refresh him normally.

However, you can use his ability multiple times during the turn, so he can attack all enemies, defend from all enemies etc. This is brilliant ability.

Frodo's response is optional.

 

About Boromir:

 

1) He has 5 HP, so he can survive some attacks or treacheries

2) His ability is an action and not a response, so you'll only use it when it's neccessary and you want to use it, unlike Aragorn or Price Imrahil. That way he is perfect to handle the Wargs - first he is able to defend against them. If the Wargs get a shadow effect while attacking Boromir, ready him, if they don't keep him exhausted.

3) Raising your threat by one point is a good price for a higher flexibility of play. You don't have to plan for every possible worst case scenario, because you have Boromir's action to get an additional defender/attacker.

4) He gets more valuable when you give him some attachments that boost his attack and defenive stats. Card synergy is a keyword when using Boromir.

 

I don't say that he's perfect, Gimli is IMO still the tactics no 1, but he certainly can be a helpful ally (in certain scenarios (Wargs!).

 Oh I see.  Yeah that is pretty good.

Uuh, Responses are also optional, you do not have to use Aragorn or Imrahil effects. The fact their are Responses allows you to play it outside of a Player Action phase. You confuse "Response" with "Forced" effects.

 What he may be saying is that Aragorn and Imrahil have specific times when they can use their ability, whereas Boromir's can be used in any Action window.

 Appropriately enough, Boromir is very useful, but dangerous to rely on.

Other Heroes with low starting Threat and cards that lower Threat are *strongly* recommended with Boromir.

As radiskull said, I meant that you're (optionally) forced to use Aragorn's ability without knowing if you'll need him. Most of the times you pay a resource and then you draw a location and Aragorn spents your coin in some tawdry Elven tavern. In Boromir's case you only activate him when he's needed.

Oh I see what you meant now. I love your Elven tavern remark, reminds me playing Majesty (the PC game) happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]
