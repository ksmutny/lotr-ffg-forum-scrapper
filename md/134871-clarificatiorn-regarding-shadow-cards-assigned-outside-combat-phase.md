Hello to everyone from Italy  ;-) !

I have some questions regarding shadow cards assigned outside the combat phase.

1) If I reveal an enemy like Haradrim Elite that makes an immediate attack when he comes in the staging area, I have to assign him a shadow card, right ?

 

2) After the assignment of the shadow card, can I make one action? During this attack, are there some steps that allow me to do one or more actions?

 

3) The shadow card is discarded at the end of this attack? Or it remains assigned to the enemy until the end of the next combat phase, where the shadow cards are discarded (as rules)?

I think that the card remain assigned, because I have not found a rule that says to discard this shadow card.

So that shadow card will give again his bonus during the combat phase (for example a shadow card that gives +2 in attack value for the first attack, continues to give his bonus during the "normal" combat phase).

 

What do you think?

 

Thank you in advance

The FAQ is your friend for these questions.

 

(1.26) Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase
If an enemy attacks outside of the combat phase, it is
still dealt a shadow card at the beginning of the attack.
Then follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 “Combat” in the
rules. Any shadow cards dealt to the attacking enemy
are discarded after the attack resolves.

 

So:

1) Yes, he gets a shadow card.

2) Yes, you have an action window (per action windows defined in the rulebook).

3) The shadow card is discarded.

Perfect!

Thank you for the clarification  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
