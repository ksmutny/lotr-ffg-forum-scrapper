 The preview for the next expansion has me really excited.

Radaghast as an ally!

More eagles!

Another twist in the encounter format! 

I'll probably get Conflict at Carrock this weekend, because I like this game (and to be honest, the core set was bit chinsey when it comes to player cards and so I'm desperately wanting more), but I'm not actually all that excited about it.

Looks like we might be getting Ioreth as an ally as well. For any MECCG veteran out there, let's see how far the old sage's marvels reach in this game! (Unless mentioning her in the preview was just a throwaway comment of course).

 Awww...yeah, I have to agree with the Core set comment...seems like they wanted to make you buy 3 for a full play set...very lame.  However, on the flip side, they are doing it right with the expansions, and I am completely happy with the card art.

 Do we know what we'll be getting for a Hero Card in this set?

I know Bilbo was in HFG and Frodo was in Carrock and I've heard several times that Boromir will be in the Dead Marshes, but I don't recall hearing anything about the Hero in the Rhosgobel expansion.

I haven't heard anything, but logic would dictate either a Leadership Hero, or none.

Hmmm, what say you more token adding/tweaking leadership?

Maybe a Hero that can move resource(s) from any Hero to another?

 There was a thread a month or so ago that revealed Prince Imrahil would be the Hero in Journey to Rosgobel and he's a Leadership hero.

Also looking forward to it, but I have to say that Conflict at the Carrock has been a lot of fun.  The pacing for it and challenge is very different.  I've only played it solo so far - 1 win of 3 plays with a Leadership /Spirit deck and 1 of 3 with a Lore/Tactics deck.  I'm hoping to try it with more players tomorrow night...hopefully it provides a challenge to 3 or 4.  The first 4 quests were just too easy with more than 2.

Hey Kiwina, that link didn't work for me.  Does it just confirm that Imrahil is the hero, or does it give stats and whatnot also?

No stats (except for having Gondor trait), just confirmation. But there's a picture of Haldir at the French website.

That's good. Gondor needed a Leadership Hero.

Its funny you say that because that has been on my mind for a long time. I wonder if that would get to be too powerful, or even negate the songs, but if it was the ability of a hero, perhaps it would not be too overpowered, as long as there is some limitation.

Leader: "Hey! Yeah, you! Give your money to my friend here. Cause I said so! I'm the boss."

Denethor: "*whines* One day, I'll be the boss and then I'll show you all!"

Leader: "Shut yer trap and tell us which enemy is coming next.

Sounds like so many conversations i've had before.

Any news of Imrahil. I wonder he has not been spoiled yet? Also, beside the Gondor trait does he also get Dol Amroth one?
