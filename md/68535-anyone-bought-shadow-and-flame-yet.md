With the first Hobbit Sage expansion announced to be launched in "mid-August" I was wondering if the Shadow and Flame expantion is on sale elsewhere. I have not found it here in shops here in Denmark or on Amazon (but Amazon is usually a bit slow to get it).

Maybe we will be able to buy both S&F and the Saga expansions at the same time.

i certainly hope that shadow comes out before the saga expansion….i heard it was due out last thursday….but im not in the US…i know the player Durin III gets his packs almost always before most people and posts some spoilers. its usually another 1- 2 weeks until uk gets it

i also have a feeling the hobbit may be a bit later than mid august, if its anything like what khazad's release was like (which is hope it isnt)

ps. im really on the edge of my seat for the spoilers for this one- i think its going to be epic

It's always a good idea to check the "Upcoming" page. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Shadow and Flame (which was last updated on 7/30) states that it's "Shipping Now" from FFG warehouses to game stores (which takes 7-10 business days).

The Hobbit expansion (which was last updated 8/1) is "On the Boat" which means it will take 4-6 weeks to arrive at FFG's warehouses, and then another 7-10 business days to arrive at retailers.

Thanks for the shout out Rich! Still no news or anything here in North Carolina. Unusual to say the least; they have kept this one secret! I will post as soon as I get them.

Looks like FFG is all over over the place about GenCon and lets everything else on the side :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I'm really eager to put my hands on an actual Elrond, we've been proxying it and Vilya for 2 weeks with my friends, but that definitely doesn't feel like the real card :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Fedt. En meddansker der også spiller LotR :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Faraos cigar eller fantask må da næsten have dette spil? Men det er sandt hvad de siger. Hvis ikke den er til salg på FFG's egen side er den som regel ikke ude noget andet sted heller. Bor selv i Norge og køber direkte fra FFG'S side. Eller amazon hvis den er udsolgt.

I wil be dissapointed if the Hobbit edition is not at GenCon.  I am hoping for at least a minimum supply for sale there.  A option to buy may be a participation prize if you are in the Laketown event on Friday of GenCon.  At this point, I am waiting to pick up Shadow there.   We are only two weeks away from the big dance anyway.

My guess it will be available this Monday, at least here in the states.

Hi Thomas,

I will reply in English as this is an English speaking forum.

You are right. Based on the member search facility on this site there are not that many LOTR LCG players in Denmark. I live in Copenhagen and most of the times we buy the LOTR LCG expansions at either Faraos or Fantask. It seems they each buy four or five copies of each expansion so maybe they share around ten LOTR LCG customers in the Copenhagen area between them. Of course other Danish players buy them online or from other shops.

This is not a problem for me and my family as we play it as a family game - both solo and up to four players. The cooperative gameplay and scalability from single to multiplayer are the best features about this game's design and it was the major reason that we picked it up on recommendations from Faraos - apart from the always popular LOTR theme of course.
