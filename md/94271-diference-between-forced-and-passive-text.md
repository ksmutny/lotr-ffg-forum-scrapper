# [Diference between Forced and Passive text?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94271-diference-between-forced-and-passive-text/)

Which is the diference?, why some texts are 'forced' and some text are none?

 

For example: which diference is there?:

Why one location has forced word and other not?

Forced means it must happen. It is not optional.

Sometimes I think it's just lack of consistent design, or-- maybe put more realistically, inconsistencies between cards as the design process has evolved.

 

BUT there is indeed a difference in timing.  Sometimes you have multiple effects to resolve at the end of a phase, or round, or after a particular event.  Passive "always active" text triggers first, then Forced effects.  From the FAQ:

 

(1.37) Timing of effect resolution

When resolving multiple effects with a shared
condition, players should use this order of resolution:
passive abilities first, Forced effects second, Response
actions third. When determining the order of effect
resolution among abilities within those categories,
players should first resolve abilities that use the word
“when” and then resolve abilities with the word “after”.
 
So from a rules standpoint, there is a reason why some text is passive and some is Forced.  But no particular reason, that I can see, why a card like Gladden Fields is Forced rather than passive, or why Hidden Path is passive rather than Forced.

Hidden Path has a constant effect.

Gladden Fields has an effect which triggers at a specified time.

mmmmh, ok,

but....

 

If there are 2 cards with the same 'forced', you must do both or only one when the thing that triggers them happens?

For example:

 

ffg_croaking-crows-otd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_croaking-crows-otd.jpg]

Croaking Crows:

Forced: When a location is revealed from the encounter deck, put 1 progress on Smaug the Golden.

 

If there are 2 Croaking Crowns, and some 'forced' must be resolve one by one...., the second 'forced' is out? Only one forced is at time? The second musn't triggered because the 'event' has passed up yet?

 

Do you have to put 2 tokens on Smaug, or only 1?

It's like response, you should resolve each one separatly.

 

The wrong thinking is that gama advance after resolving an effect. It's not. After something happen and lot of things trigger, you should resolved all of them. Starting with passive first, then forced, then response. First player choose the order between each of the same. After each effect are resolved, other triggers that appeared can be triggered. Your game progression only resume when you have nothing else to trigger and proceed to the next action.

Exemple : if a character leaves play and you play heroic sacrifice, you can draw another heroic sacrifice and play it.

Other exemple : the Nine are Abroad says to treat all character's text boxes as if they were blank until the end of the round. You have Gandalf in play. At the end of turn, the text of Gandalf is blank, so he doesn't go away, the passive wears off. But it's still the end of turn and the game didn't advance. So the forced effect of Gandalf will still trigger.
