After about 5 trials, I managed to compete the first scenario "Voyage Across Belegaer" today :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. Probably thanks to staying on-course throughout most of the voyage and swift questing, avoiding to see many ship-enemies.

Playing just now again, I've got a few things that need clearing.

The Fog Bank location says: "While Fog Bank is the active location, Ship enemies do not make engagement checks, cannot attack, and cannot be attacked."

Does this stop me from optionally engaging 1 of the ship enemies in the staging area? I'm guessing no.

Does this stop me from attacking ship enemies with abilities that allow damaging enemies in the staging area? I assume yes.

Does this stop ship enemies from triggering their Archery keyword and causing damage? No idea.

You can optionally engage, yes.

 

You cannot attack enemy ships, so things like Dunhere or Hands Upon the Bow would not work since you are actually attacking.  Something like Ranger Bow should work because you are not attacking, just dealing damage.

 

Dealing Archery damage is not the ship attacking, so you will still suffer it.
