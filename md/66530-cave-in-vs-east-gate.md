Hi guys,

 I need a confirmation on this. East Gate is immune to card effects, and in Cave In also right?No card can interact directly with it. So CI cannot remove any progress tokens from it so it gains Surge.

"On the cards found in the quest
and encounter decks, card effects fall into one of
6 categories: constant effects, forced effects, when
revealed effects, shadow effects, travel effects, and
keywords." (p. 23)

Cave In has a When Revealed, so East Gate can't collapse.
