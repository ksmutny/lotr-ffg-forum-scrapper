The last Saga expansion, detailing the events of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It can't be the "sixth and final" expansion because it isn't the sixth expansion! =)

Woohoo!  Really cannot wait for this....Will be out of the country when it releases, but will get it immediately when back home.  

 

It is funny...When I first got into the game I did it because I thought it would be a cool way to interactively experience (ie play) the content from the books and really intended on just getting the Sagas (plus an odd pack here or there for the player cards).  However, I soon found myself so drawn to the new content that I haven't really played many of the Saga scenarios.  My plan became to just focus on the Deluxes and Cycles and wait until all of the Saga boxes were released and then play straight through all 18 quests in a totally epic campaign!!!  Though I'll probably modify campaign mode a bit by allowing myself to swap in the heroes that figured most prominently in each quest (i.e., Hobbits in Black Riders, etc.), but still keeping Boons/burdens as they make sense...

 

Oh...and everyone is right...that card art is magnificent!

I'm reading it as "sixth" and also "final" as two separate items. 

Kinda like how Decipher ended their CCG with Ages End which was their last expansion/product released for the game.

Indeed. That will make the hero versions a lot more flexible, if we can pair them with ally versions too.

It looks really great. Elladan and Elrohir, one-man-army Aragorn, a double quest for Black Gate... The only thing that bothers me is that we won't get Ringbearer Sam

EDIT: I just realised that objective attachment "the last from the company" seems to be giving Ringbearer trait. So we do get Ringbearer Sam!

Some people have speculated that maybe the final quest will be a dual thing - fighting at the Black Gate at the same time that Frodo is trying to destroy the Ring. If this is the case, then I think that would be an excellent place for them to re-use the Epic Multiplayer rules from Siege of Annuminas (as an option, obviously, not a compulsory thing).

Called it. I am incredibly happy about this.

There's so much I love about how Caleb's designed this box.

I thought that the battle at the Black Gate and Mount Doom might be combined into the final quest, but to accommodate solo players Frodo's story might get short shrift (after a Ringbearer-focused Gorgoroth quest, perhaps Frodo would be in a separate area like the Riddle area in Dungeons Deep and Caverns Dim). This approach is so much better. It allows both quests to tell their own rich stories, and I expect Epic Multiplayer Mode allows the Aragorn team to (like in the books) make things more difficult for themselves but easier for Frodo.

Slight digression: what I care most about in the Saga expansions is being able to relive LotR's story, which means I sometimes change the number of players during a campaign, to better reflect the story (in the Flame of the West, the first two quests are solo with my Grey Company deck, and the third quest is played with three players, adding a Gondor deck and a Rohan deck). I hope it will be possible in Epic Multiplayer Mode for teams to have different numbers of players: I'd like to play Frodo solo, with Aragorn's team having perhaps three players. That would likely mean that the Frodo player has to wait each round for the Aragorn players to finish, but for me that would be the ultimate way to recreate the story.

Last of the Company will work well on Sam, since it can lower an enemy's threat by the attached hero's willpower. It looks like it's intended only for The Tower of Cirith Ungol, so we probably won't have the option of playing through the campaign with an alternate Ring-bearer. The first player token doesn't rotate during that quest (except perhaps after Frodo is rescued), which avoids the awkwardness of (for example) losing your only leadership hero in a multiplayer game.

Aragorn has all the traits (including Gondor!) except Ranger. This is the first character we've seen with more than three traits (which is relevant for the upcoming The Free Peoples card), and also the only Aragorn without the Ranger trait. It fits thematically, since Aragorn is now a captain going to war, but it could be a problem for anyone who put the Forewarned boon on Aragorn (unless they gave him Tireless Ranger as well). The boon has the Permanent keyword, so you can't shift it to another hero, but I don't think you can attach it to Aragorn if he doesn't have the Ranger trait.

I love that we're getting ally versions of the twins, and they have amazing art. I expect several combinations of the twins will work well. One of the most interesting might be hero Elrohir with ally Elladan. A Lore hero helps with the card draw to find Elladan early, and hero Elrohir can be an excellent defender (although he might want Tactics for Elven Mail or Spirit for ally Arwen). I expect it would be difficult to consistently get Elladan into play round one or two, however, and early defense can be crucial. Hero Elladan with ally Elrohir seems lower risk but lower reward, since ally Elrohir isn't an amazing defender (though Narya and ally Arwen can certainly help). Playing both ally versions is probably only great if the quest has a decent number of Orc enemies.

> Quote
> 
> Whenever the main quest has the dire keyword, your threat elimination level is increased to "99," but you cannot reduce your threat by more than one each round by non-boon player card effects.

Three Golden Hairs and Brace of Coneys are the only Boon cards so far that can reduce threat, so it might be worth keeping them for the final quests. Hero Galadriel and ally Elfhelm might be useful in these quests. I hope that it will be possible to use a secrecy approach for Mount Doom: thematically, I'd like to minimize combat for Frodo and Sam. Orc Disguise likely helps with that, and in Epic Multiplayer Mode Aragorn's team might be able to reduce Frodo's threat or draw enemies away from Frodo. The spoiled treachery can increase threat by 10, so I expect that the quest will punish high threat (aside from enemy engagement) well before 99. Neither A Test of Will nor The Black Riders version of Frodo can cancel the first treachery each round during stage one, so Fortitude tests (and deciding whether to exhaust the One Ring) will be important. I wonder whether Fortitude tests depend primarily on Willpower or something else (perhaps partly resources, since this version of Frodo can gain resources). I also wonder whether the Wraith on Wings burden will be used in the Frodo quests or in the Aragorn quest. I expect that there will be no more than four Nazgûl enemies in the encounter decks during the last two quests, since the quests happen simultaneously and there are only eight Nazgûl remaining.

I am super excited about this expansion, and looking forward to playing the complete saga campaign.

The article didn't say that there's no spirit Aragorn in this box.

Wait... Where is Gollum and Smeagol? Don't tell me that he just appear on the box cover.

A little disappointed for the Epic mode for the last two quests, I assume they should be one like the quest in Hobbit saga, and scouring for Shire is the last one to make the story complete, maybe the pod mode is better for scouring for Shire because the company of Samwise is better to be object ally other than player card ally.

Thanks all the designers for making the whole saga done, great job!

100% agree with your list. Hero leadership Eomer and tactics ally Meneldor are pretty save bets (when  if not now :D). Leadership ally Bergil fits great with other Gondor allies and he can always have "can't (attack or) defend" if it seems to inappropriate to have him chump-block/participate in fighting as a child. Tactics Sam indeed seems a little odd as he most likely would keep his stats and tactics would be about to get a lot of willpower with him and new Eowyn lately. Maybe they could Sam have a planning action to lower his willpower in exchange for a attack/defense boost, what would show that Sam's fearsomeness isn't because of his great combat-skills, but because of his enormous courage.

Thanks for the detailed look into the possibilities. It got me reflecting, and I posted a detailed comment in response.

In summary, I noticed that Saga heroes almost always share a racial trait with any ally that shares their sphere in the same release. This is an ironclad rule since Treason of Saruman. (Road Darkens doesn't have any neutral allies. Bill the Pony and Barliman Butterbur are technically exceptions, but they interact with the hobbit trait. The only clear exception is way back in the first Saga expansion, with Beorn and Bofur.) If this rule is followed in The Mountain of Fire, I predict that we will get Leadership Éomer and Tactics Gwaihir heroes, with Leadership Elfhelm and Tactics Meneldor allies. Elfhelm's the most questionable, since we already have him twice (though not in Saga). I could see him being replaced by someone from Gondor: perhaps Húrin the Tall, Angbor the Fearless, Bergil, or even Pippin. Hirgon could also work, as someone who might interact with the Rohan trait, though he dies before the Battle of Pelennor Fields.

Alternatively, if Caleb decides to repeat a saga hero for the first time (Flame of the West repeated a core set hero, at least partly because Spirit Éowyn was not great at her big moment of killing the Witch-king; I think Leadership Sam should work well for Cirith Ungol), we could get Leadership Éomer and Tactics Sam heroes, with Leadership Merry and Tactics Pippin allies. Merry would share the Rohan trait with Éomer, and Pippin would share the Hobbit trait with Sam.

## 46 [dalestephenson on April 14, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246928-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=2732093)

I agree with the consensus on Leadership Eomer as a hero.  The article text about going into battle with Aragorn, Gandalf, Imrahil, and Eomer requires some version of Eomer since he has no core or saga version.  The idea of pairing a leadership Rohan Merry ally with him is clever, though given his absence at the black gate seems an odd fit for this box.  (A leadership Rohan Merry hero would totally rock for Scouring of the Shire, though.) . Unfortunately, aside from Eomer there's no named Rohirrim at the black gate, I believe, so reaching back for a past captain would be the only option if matching the trait.  Elfhelm already has an ally, Dunhere was dead, Theodred was dead, Erkenbrand was left in Rohan -- I'm not seeing a likely suspect for a Rohan ally, even aside from the heavy spirit lean of Rohan decks.

The article also mentions "other cards to help you raise your spirits and evade the evils around you."  I'm guessing that's code for willpower boost and raising engagement cost, but maybe there's another encounter discarding effect of some sort coming.

We already have Saga versions of all the named characters at the Black Gate except Éomer and the Eagles. Authraw mentioned this quote in his blog post:

> Quote
> 
> There was Gandalf as chief herald, and Aragorn with the sons of Elrond, and Éomer of Rohan, and Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness.

Gandalf is in Road Darkens (and Core), Aragorn is the Fellowship hero, the twins are in this box, Imrahil is in Flame of the West, Legolas and Gimli are in Treason of Saruman (and Core), and Pippin is in Black Riders.  Aside from that quote, the only named characters at the Black Gate are Mablung (who avoided the ambush, and is in Land of Shadow), Beregond (in Flame of the West), and Gwaihir, Landroval, and Meneldor. I don't expect any saga-repeating characters (with the possible exception of Pippin) to appear in Mountain of Fire, and I don't expect us to get three Eagles in this box, so I think it's likely that we'll get a character who wasn't at the Black Gate. That also fits with Gamling and Skinbark appearing in The Land of Shadow. Elfhelm and Húrin are the two most important remaining characters: both had important roles in the battle of Pelennor Fields, are both were left with command in Minas Tirith while Aragorn went to the Black Gate. Elfhelm has the advantage of matching Éomer's trait, but the disadvantage of having already appeared twice in the game (while we haven't seen Húrin). Bergil plays a smaller military role, but a significant role in the story.

I also think that a Leadership Merry hero would be great for Scouring in the Shire. I hadn't noticed "other cards to help you raise your spirits and evade the evils around you," and I'm excited about it. Orc Disguise probably fits into evading the evils around you, but I hope there are a couple of other attachments or events that support a minimal ally, minimal combat approach for Frodo and Sam. Perhaps we'll get a card related to the stars. Sam sings about them in the tower, Frodo calls out "Hail, brightest of stars" (in Elvish) while escaping the Watchers when leaving the tower, and Sam (who mentions that he would ask Galadriel for light and water, then finds them) sees a star that strengthens him:

> Quote
> 
> Far above the Ephel Dúath in the West the night-sky was still dim and pale. There, peeping among the cloud-wrack above a dark tor high up in the mountains, Sam saw a white star twinkle for a while. The beauty of it smote his heart, as he looked up out of the forsaken land, and hope returned to him. For like a shaft, clear and cold, the thought pierced him that in the end the Shadow was only a small and passing thing: there was light and high beauty for ever beyond its reach. His song in the Tower had been defiance rather than hope; for then he was thinking of himself. Now, for a moment, his own fate, and even his masters, ceased to trouble him. He crawled back into the brambles and laid himself by Frodo’s side, and putting away all fear he cast himself into a deep untroubled sleep.

It's fair to say that the named people known to be at the black gate are few in number, and with the exception of the eagles and Eomer are already represented as saga heroes or allies.  There's precious few other named people who *could've* been at the black gate.  For that reason, I think it's certainly plausible that the remaining characters could dip into people we know were not there.

However, I think that choosing a *Merry* ally would be very odd, unless the other missing ally is Pippin.  I think a leadership Merry is as thematic as humanly (hobbitly?) possible for Scouring of the Shire, but for the Black Gate he wasn't allowed there *and Pippin was*.  If we get a single hobbit ally for this box, it has to be Pippin.  (If we get a single hobbit hero, it has to be Sam, even though two sphered heroes for the same character would be unprecedented for saga.)

Now if you have Leadership Rohan Merry ally with Leadership Eomer, and Tactics Gondor Pippin ally with Tactics Hurin hero (or Tactics Pippin with Tactics Sam), you can make the affiliation work -- but then there's no room for Eagles, and I think there really *has* to be Eagles here.  If tactics is Gwaihir + Meneldor, that leaves one missing ally and I don't think it can be Merry, much as I'd love him.

If it's not Merry, and it *is* Rohan, I would still expect to exclude dead Rohirrim, so no Dunhere or Theodred.  But I don't agree Elfhelm becomes the obvious choice.  Yes, he's got an important job and has actual speaking lines (unlike Hurin), but he's got an ally version already and being left in charge of the Riders at Gondor isn't substantially more important than being left in charge of the Riders at Rohan -- Erkenbrand doesn't have an ally version yet and has not appeared yet in the saga.  But if going out on a limb for a Rohan ally, I'd plump for Widfara.  He's just a rider, but in the context of LOTR Elfhelm and Erkenbrand are just as much bit players as he, and he does have actual lines (unlike Hurin).  As a bonus, he has no existing card and actually *could* have been at the Black Gates as a warrior.  Finally, his "weather wise" role would make him a scout and justify giving a cool ability.

Having said all that, Bergil is certainly the second-most prominent free peoples character in the LOTR to have no card anywhere, IMO.  (First would be Lobelia Sackville-Baggins, but I'm not going to hold my breath for her card.)

## 50 [Estel Edain on April 14, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246928-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=2732679)

I agree that we won't get Merry unless we get Pippin, and it seems unlikely that we get no eagles. Éomer and Gwaihir heroes with Merry and Pippin allies might work, although obviously Gwaihir and Pippin wouldn't match traits.

Widfara to me would feel a bit anticlimactic in the final saga box. I think Erkenbrand was crowded out of the saga because there were arguably more important Rohan characters at Helm's Deep (Háma and Gamling), and the quest focuses on the defense, not the reinforcements. At Pelennor Fields, the main Rohan commanders (under Théoden) were Éomer, Elfhelm, and Grimbold, and Elfhelm is more present in the story than Erkenbrand is. Also, Elfhelm was fighting in Anórien while Aragorn went to the Black Gate. Ally Elfhelm is not a weak card, but is niche, so I could see us getting another version.

All that said, I would not be at all surprised to see Caleb break the matching trait rule and give us a Leadership Gondor ally together with Éomer, especially since Rohan and Gondor are fully allied at this point. Pippin is certainly possible, though it might feel weird to get Pippin without Merry. Bergil and Húrin are, in my mind, the other likely candidates.

Although fully on board with Leadership Eomer and Tactics Gwaihir/Meneldor, I'm left wondering what Spirit Rohan hero we'll be getting in The Black Serpent adventure pack. Part of me hoped it would be Eomer, so I could finally make a mono-Spirit Rohan deck that I'd enjoy (sorry Dunhere). But Eomer deserves the Leadership spot in Mountain of Fire more than anyone else. So perhaps Grimbold (or someone else of similar importance) will be the hero of The Black Serpent.

Brand, Hama, Faramir, Mablung, Erestor, Argalad. Only one of those is an FFG creation. Am I missing something? I wouldn't be surprised or displeased if we got an FFG Rohan hero, but I'm not seeing the pattern.

Oh hey, you're right. I thought the pattern was 2 and 4, but it looks like only 2 is fairly consistently an FFG original.

2 has been pretty consistent (Frodo, Elladan, Mirlonde, Idraen, Rossiel, Lanwyn, and Thurindir), and 5 has been almost as consistent (Boromir, Glorfindel, Caldara, Galadriel, Amarthiul, and Na'asiyah). The Ring-maker cycle is the latest cycle to have only one FFG-created hero, and the Dream-chaser cycle is the first cycle to have three FFG-created heroes.

We're getting more FFG-created heroes (partly to avoid uniqueness clashes from repeating Tolkien's characters too often), but I would be a bit surprised if the majority of a cycle's heroes were FFG-created. Since we already have two FFG-created heroes in this cycle, I expect that we'll only get one more. Since Argalad showed up, I'm confident we'll get Eometh at some point, possibly in The Black Serpent. If so, I expect the 5th pack's hero will be a slight break with tradition: it won't be FFG-created.

Here's a recap of what we know about this cycle's remaining heroes (after two Leadership, one Spirit, and one Lore hero in the Deluxe and first two packs):

Beneath the Sands - Scout, very likely Tactics (perhaps Hirgon, Orophin, or Rumil)

The Black Serpent - Spirit Rohan (perhaps Eometh, Grimbold, Gamling, or even Éomer)

The Dungeons of Cirith Gurat - Lore, perhaps Warrior

The Crossings of Poros - Ent, very likely Tactics (perhaps Quickbeam, Skinbark, or even Leaflock)

I would love to see a Grimbold hero at some point. The Crossings of Poros mentions that an Ent hero is accompanied by a Hobbit ally. That could be Merry or Pippin, which would decrease the likelihood of them showing up in The Mountain of Fire (though it's possible to get Merry in Crossings of Poros and Pippin in Mountain of Fire).

I would quite literally jump for joy if we got a Orophin/Rumil hero. I think Hirgon would be a great choice for a hero, just described enough to get a sense of his character, but still very open to ideas. Since we have a cycle after this on, it'll probably be up in the Dale region and that trait will finally get developed. That would also be a great time for us to get the long-awaited Thranduil hero and hopefully a Thorin III Stonehelm hero.

The journey through Mordor is told almost exclusively from Sam's perspective.  Frodo is pretty much deleroius the whole time.  I can't imagine not having a Hero Sam in this box.  I always felt the other person responsible for getting the ring bearers to the mountain was Galadriel.  It seemed to me that she was protecting them from afar with her magic.  How about tactics Sam and leadership Galadriel?

It would be a bit of a shame if neither of the new heroes fit well in Cirith Ungol or Mount Doom. A new Sam would be very welcome, even if it's a saga repetition. But if we don't get Sam, then an eagle is my favorite alternative. An eagle hero could be played on either side of the table (Black Gate or Mount Doom).

Sam would make sense, but I think that spirit Galadriel is perfect for representing her magic influence (although she is not from saga boxes). If we get another version she will be either mostly copy of spirit or won't represent how her magic helped Sam. The only version that would make sense would be keeping her nenya questing, but removing ally buff (it doesn't help Sam's journey). But her action is simply the best for secrecy decks...

Hey, I posted that on Discord! With that said, it is very likely they originally commissioned that art for Elfhelm, but ended up using another piece of art for him. Happens a lot (a lot of the orc art gets renamed and reused). Then they reuse the commissioned art for other cards. Thus, even though the filename says Elfhelm, I'm almost certain they will use that art for Éomer or other Rohan character.

I would honestly be kind of disappinted if we got a Rohan FFG-created hero in Black Serpent. Even though I love FFG-created heroes, 3 in a row would be way too much. We're finally in Harad, we don't know really how many cycles there are left, and I would just prefer if the game went back to canon Middle Earth. I mean. we don't know how much time is left for this game and there is still so much more stuff to explore. We still haven't seen Thranduil, and I think everyone would agree that we need a new version of Radagast, and Bilbo, and Saruman, even Eomer, plus as I ve always said there's the theme of artifacts that's been avoided like the plague by this game.

I don't entirely agree with you regarding new areas - I've always thought that the Far North would be fun for example.

I should imagine that we'll hear within the next couple of months or so whether there will be a new cycle - personally I have no idea whatsoever if another one or two are coming. FFG are being pretty quiet these days about LoTR LCG but that could mean anything. I own 6 cycles with all of the sagas and standalone packs. I also have more player cards than you can shake a stick at. I don't really need any more stuff for this game....

Don't get me wrong, that was a hastily written post. I mean, I would love if next cycle we went to northern Rhovanion, particularly the mountains and the Withered Heath. That's pretty obscure, plus I would love to have a Forochel quest. I speak more about the player cards, and how *at this point* I wish they would finish developing the main themes of classic Middle Earth (Rohan needs a boost, Beornings, Istari heroes, artifacts, etc) instead of insisting with FFG created stuff which they've proven to be far more than capable of doing.

I hear you, and there are several canon elements of Middle Earth that I would love to see in the player cards (especially ally versions of some of the central characters, like Aragorn, Éomer, Merry and Pippin). At the same time, I expect that the designers will delay including some of Tolkien's significant characters (or at least good versions of them) until the end of the game, so that players have cards to anticipate. In the first Game of Thrones LCG,  House Arryn (which is moderately significant in the story) only got cards for their characters in the last cycle.

If this game still has another two or more cycles left after the current cycle, I wouldn't really mind getting three FFG-created heroes this cycle, like in the last cycle: Lanwyn, Argalad, and Na'asiyah. The canon heroes from the Dreamchaser cycle are all duplicates of earlier player cards (although there was no Elfhelm hero before), and there are a limited number of named characters who seem like suitable heroes. Using three FFG-created heroes per cycle (with no FFG-created heroes in deluxe expansions) might allow FFG to prolong the game's lifespan without too many duplicate heroes, which can cause issues with uniqueness clashes, especially in multiplayer.

In terms of the specific player cards you mentioned that we're lacking, I think the designers have been addressing some of those issues, although the player card pool expands slowly. They've given more support to archetypes that needed it, like secrecy and sidequests. Rider of Rohan is a minor boost for Rohan, although it requires a side quest to maximize its potential. I'm confident we'll be getting more Rohan support (hopefully including a Grimbold hero at some point). We should be getting a new Éomer hero in The Mountain of Fire, and the announcement article mentioned Beorning support in The Crossings of Poros. I think there's a good chance that we'll see Thranduil in the next deluxe expansion, if the deluxe is set near Erebor/Dale. I'm not sure where a new Bilbo hero might fit, or what support they might print for Istari and artifacts: I could see that being one of the themes they develop during a cycle.

How many scenarios are in this quest?   What are they called? Trying to plan a Fellowship quest event and trying to gauge if we can complete the box in a session or not.    I heard the last scenario can be played in EPIC mode - is that combined with the 2nd scenario or is the Black Gate it's own thing?

3 quests: The Tower of Cirith Ungol, The Black Gate, and Mount Doom. 

The last two quests can be combined and played simultaneously, with some players trying to hold out as long as they can while others try to get the ring to Mount Doom. It's pretty fun, and quite difficult!

Excellent!  thanks!  On the split team option, is it suggested to send 2 and 2 or should 3 hold the Black Gate while 1 goes with Frodo (assuming 4 players)?

I would put as many players as possible on the Black Gate for sure. Each additional player makes it that much easier to weather the +1 encounter card revealed per turn.

@Authraw [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/229935-authraw/], now that you've had a chance to play through the quests, I'd love it if you gave us some initial impressions. I also have a few specific questions: are there any new boons or burdens? Is Wraith on Wrings included for The Tower of Cirith Ungol? This is a bit spoilery, so I don't necessarily want all the details, but how did you find Mount Doom handled Gollum? Specifically, was he able to help in some way with the final Fortitude check? Did players have the option to kill him/remove him from play for short term advantage, but then lose the benefit he would provide for the final check?

@Slothgodfather [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/181150-slothgodfather/], I intend to have 3 players for The Black Gate Opens and 1 for Mount Doom in my thematic campaign, using Epic Multiplayer Mode. Apparently Caleb said he liked 4 and 2, and it makes sense to have more players in an epic battle and fewer for a quest focused on keeping your threat low.

## 83 [Slothgodfather on September 12, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246928-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=2980789)

We haven't managed to beat The Black Gate / Mount Doom yet--I can't quite stay alive long enough playing solo. I can definitely see that 4 on Black Gate and 2 on Mount Doom would be the sweet spot; The Black Gate will definitely just get more epic the more players you add, and with 2 players at the other table nobody's basically left playing a game all by themselves.

Sure thing!

Cirith Ungol 

 

Cirith Ungol is a fairly standard quest compared to the other two quests in the box. The middle of the quest has some fun mechanics where it brings out extra Enemies, but if there's a copy of that Enemy in the Staging Area already they discard each other instead. There's also a memorable Treachery that deals 1 damage to each Enemy in the Staging Area but then gives them +1 threat for each damage on them. It's actually a really great quest for

Infighting [http://ringsdb.com/card/02058].

It's not that difficult of a quest, but we thought it was fun.

To answer your specific question: Yes, Wraith on Wings is included in Cirith Ungol.

The Black Gate

 

This is the one that has no win condition, it's just survive-until-you-die. The way they do that is by revealing an extra +1 card for each round that goes by. So on round 2, the first player reveals 2 cards instead of 1. On round 3, 3 cards, etc. As you can imagine, things get out of hand pretty fast.

This quest starts out with a pretty cool mechanic in which you parley with the Mouth of Sauron, revealing extra cards to play cards for free. In Epic Multiplayer mode there are a few extra mechanics with the Nazgul Enemies all following whichever staging area has the Eye of Sauron and each team selecting either a free card or threat reduction. 

My partner and I are trying to beat this one Epic-multiplayer style, with me on The Black Gate and her on Mount Doom. I'm not sure this is going to work, though, since my current high score is 7 rounds (and I only survived that long once!) and that's not much time for her to clear 4 quest stages (one of which requires 20 progress).

If you play it in non-Epic-multiplayer mode, then however many rounds you survive on this quest is how long you have to complete the last one. This quest does have the only boon in the box, Gwaihir, who's a Ranged Sentinel 3 / 3 / 3 / 5 character that gets shuffled into the encounter deck at the start of the game.

Mount Doom

 

This quest focuses on Fortitude tests and raises your threat at the end of each round by the number of non-Fellowship characters you control. The difficulty isn't too high by itself--probably falls somewhere in the middle--but if you're playing it Saga-style you're on a really short ticking clock, and it's a pretty long quest as far as these things go.

The way they handled Gollum is interesting; he's just in the encounter deck and there's a single copy of a Treachery that fetches him if he's not in play. The trick is that he enters play when he's discarded as part of a Fortitude test, but when he does so he actually helps you on that Fortitude test. There are a few pivotal Fortitude tests during the game (including near the end) so if he's still in the encounter deck at that point you could theoretically end up with an ending much like the books.

The worst enemies (the Nazgul and the 7 attack Gorgoroth Hill Troll) cannot be trapped. The other enemies can be, but 6 of those (out of 15) have Archery. Most of them aren't too bad, either, with only 3-4 attack and about 5 combined def+hp.

So traps might be part of a strategy to help you ignore the little guys and focus on the big scary ones, but it's not going to solve any of the major problems you have to face.

Only to prevent threat gain due to questing unsuccessfully. The quest has an effect that discards the active location when you quest unsuccessfully, so I don't think you're really meant to be able to quest successfully for long.

I assume you mean Spirit Pippin? Hmmm... It might if you had some way to deal with stuff in the staging area. Threat is definitely one of the many common ways to lose, but maybe if you mostly ignored combat you could find a way to survive a few more rounds? Might be worth a try.

Yeah, Doom Hangs Still works great in this quest--you basically buy yourself another round. The Black Gate gathers its tokens during the Quest Phase, too, so it would even skip accumulating +1 encounter card that round.

Is 10 weeks quite normal or is it as highly unusual as it feels? 

I pre-ordered from the UK which said estimated July,  but now I see that coolstuffinc have updated their estimate to October. 

Are those estimates a wild guess or do they get informed from the distribution companies to the length of these delays.

Path to Carcosa is annunced to september since two months. Akrham Horror get a high support. For example it have been released at the same time in French and about LoTR we almost ever have to wait one week to one month to get the translate version done.

But yeah, I still hope that mountain of fire is right after :). Anyway I already play major part of the cards players in my decks. The last time I was doing that was when we get to know the doomed event cards. So to me it it the best expansion about player cards since voice of isengard.

Would someone who has a copy of the game be able to tell me whether the rulebook clarifies how to distribute burdens in Epic Multiplayer Mode? Specifically, burdens from Journey in the Dark, Breaking of the Fellowship, and The Battle of Pelennor Fields are supposed to be included in both The Black Gate Opens and Mount Doom. My guess is that the teams can divide up the earned burdens between the two quests as they please (putting Ill Fate in my ally-light deck for Mount Doom minimizes its potential harm and helps with Fortitude tests by adding a card to the encounter deck with no Sauron's Eye icon), but the rulebook might specify some restrictions, or even (though this seems unlikely) add burdens to the campaign pool.

For example, if The Battle of Pelennor Fields was played with two players, two copies of Wraith on Wings would be added to the campaign pool. If one of those players played The Black Gate Opens two-handed, and the other played Mount Doom two-handed, both those quests would normally have two copies of Wraith on Wings (unless players managed to remove some copies from the campaign pool). In Epic Multiplayer Mode, should there be 2 copies of Wraith on Wings in total, or 4? (Adding burdens to the campaign pool could lead to running out of burdens and needing buy another set or proxy, if there are more than four players in Epic Multiplayer Mode.)

I can't find a copy of the scenario setup cards - but do you keep the Wraith on Wings burdens going into the Black Gate and Mount Doom quests?   If so - if you split the teams into 2 games, how do you handle them?

How are people beating Mount Doom?

So far i'm stuck on this quest. First time I was trying the multi-player mode with three rohan decks at the black gate, and a rossial/glorfindel/thaurundir deck at mount doom. I try and do my first playthough of a quest blind, so had no idea about the anti-ally mechanics until i started, so brought totally the wrong deck to the quest (The rohan decks on the other hand were slaughtering the black gate).

Tried again with a hobbit deck, trying to keep the character count down and use lots of attachments to beef up the heroes - similar to the early hobbit builds around the time of the black riders. Several games, managed to get as far as halfway progress on 3B before losing.

Tried a radically different approach this afternoon, with Treebeard, Cirdan and Galadriel, and a minimum of powerful allies such as OHAUH Gandalf, with healing, readying and stats boosting.
After a couple of games, this one made it as far as the final quest stage, but was unable to ready anyone for the final fortitude tests. (I guess that means Gandalf, Galadriel, Cirdan and Treebeard all got corrupted by the ring...!)

What strategies are people employing against this quest? Which frodo are people using? I started with the new one in the box, but switched to the one from Land of Shadow to get the willpower boost.

I'm not sure this would help with strategy, but I'll tell you what I did.  My first playthough of the campaign was with a Sam/Fatty/Bilbo deck.  For Mount Doom, all my Lord cards were fast hitches or card draw.  I used the newest Frodo to help pay for the extra cards.  By I got to stage 3 I would have a number of songs on Sam including Fireside Song.  That plus Rosie would give me a hero with double digit spirit I could ready multiple times.  My problem was not getting enough turns from the Black Gate.  After some failed tries I got the win only when I got a sneak attack and Gandalf to complete the first stage on turn one.

Gave Mount Doom another shot this evening playing two-handed with the pair of decks i'd previously tried solo - Hobbits and attachments and Treebeard/Galadriel/Cirdan....and finally succeeded in the quest, completing the final fortitude test with just Frodo and Sam. After several failed attempts, finally succeeding in destroying the ring felt pretty epic.

Am I missing something in the epic multiplayer mode card, or have I misunderstood something in the epic mode rules - It says:

 "Forced: At the end of the round, the first player chooses a scenario (The Black Gate Opens or Mount Doom). Each player at the chosen scenario draws 1 card. Each player at the other scenario reduces his threat by 3. Then, the player who controls the Gwaihir objective-ally may give control of it to another player (at either scenario). "

I was under the impression that there was a first player in each team, not a single "first player" across both? Or does this effect trigger for each team seperatley?

At the end of the set up, it tells you to put it in the mount doom area.  I assume it's referring to that stages first player

I really like this three quests. The first is pretty classic, nothing really amazing but still okay. Then we come to the black gate and we face a whole new challenge. And I find it exciting to deal with more and more encounter card until you fall, no matter if I play with mount doom at the same time or if I will die at the end no matter what.

And finally mount doom. In solo I find it really hard since I usually build my decks around allies. They can be small, big, recursive, tribal, come with swarm or slowly. And so far I remember I'm not able to find another scenario who punish that well all of them (escape from dol guldur punish well enough swarm ^^). You must focus on equip some heroes rather to play allies (you can have some but not too much) to get over this mountain. But even like this it is hard to deal with quest, fight and still do fortitude test so we are usually screw up anyway.

Has anyone beat Mount Doom in pure solo? If yes, what deck did  you use?

Those quests are insanely tough, it's like they counter any strategy you could have thought of! :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

My Outlands swarm and my Gondor swarm could not do it... Now trying with a Caladra deck, and getting destroyed....

I was trying Caldara and TE too to see if the best swarm can defeat it by being really fast. It may be possible but I also fail at doing it.

Now I will play it with my combo deck and my Vilya deck. It seem to be possible this way :).

I think that the best strategy is to have the less allies possible, because :

-your threat raises based on how many characters you control;

-some treachery and locations punish you for having allies.

I wonder if a secrecy deck with Gandalf ally and a few powerful allies (not Ents to be thematic) could be good. With ways to give heroes a ton of ready effects and questing power (like songs), because the quest doesn't punish you for having attachments. Like a Sam deck with Spirit Beregond or something. :mellow: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_mellow.png]

I really suck with saga but what part is wrong? It is because you can't select your frodo (I assume that you should play the one of the box since the beginning but was never sure of that) or because cards can't be canceled?

You can select your Frodo. But the quest card says that the first treachery card revealed each round gains surge and is immune to player card effects.

In my campaign play through I actually use Fatty Bolger and Bilbo Baggins, but this is probably a better line up.  Also, I had a game end with an uncancelable Heavy and Tired.  If that had happened again, I would have swapped in some Power of Orthancs.

Interesting to see Fireside Song in there, Id overlooked that when I was adding willpower boosting to a similar deck for this quest. I found Fellowship of the Ring to be quite good in this quest, as you have so few characters you dont often have one destroyed, and it provides a nice boost to everyone.

Did you try this deck out yet?  I'm going to create it and try beating Mt.Doom.  Only things is that Power of Orthanc should be in there.  Do I just add them to the deck to make it 53 cards, or should they be swapped with something (if so, what is it?)?

This isn't a good deck at all, just FYI.  Tried 5 times and lost them all on easy mode.  One of the games was lost due to the Heavy and Tired that came out.  I don't advocate using this deck whatsoever.  Just not a good one at all.

If a deck did not accomplish for you what you wanted it to, so be it. Never play it again. But don’t harshly criticize someone else’s work (even if the deck is bad, which this one is not) especially when others might find the same deck very helpful.

It's amazing how in today's society, nobody can take criticism.  What others may find helpful others do not.  This is a fact in life, and you must accept that.  If it's bad for me, I can criticize it however I want to.  In fact, I can go into detail on why the deck is not helpful, but even that is likely to be branded as "oh no! You should not criticize this deck!"  This same psychology reminds me of a GMT games group where anything negative said about a GMT game was censored and removed.  If you want to live in a fascist totalitarian state, go do it somewhere else!

Actually, you probably would get less criticism and better feedback if you went into detail on how the deck wasn't helpful. By just bashing it and claiming "it's not a good deck at all...I don't advocate using this deck whatsoever." is going to ruffle feathers and make it easy to write you off as the brazen, foolish loudmouth who doesn't understand how to run other people's decks; particularly with the tone that you adopt regarding the game (with statements like "I'm going to sell this game if I can't beat this quest in X number of tries!").

## 156 [dalestephenson on September 3, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246928-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=3776660)

You should *definitely* go into detail on why you found the deck not helpful.  Dismissing a deck as "bad" because you lost five times in a row tells us practically nothing, especially against a quest where losing five times in a row isn't remarkable at all.  Seastan's One Deck lost 24 times in a row, and that is a very very good deck (though ill-suited for this scenario).  This deck seems to be a good fit for this scenario -- few characters, high willpower allies with lots of readying.  On the surface it seems the sort of deck that *should* do well against the quest.  So what made it fail in your play-throughs?

You mentioned that one loss had Heavy and Tired come out.  The deck as published has no answer for that, lacking Power of Orthanc and possessing Test of Wills that are rarely useful in this quest.  When published Drinking Song didn't exist, and that's a perfect card for this deck.  It needs Gandalf or Gondorian Fire to kill anything.  SpMerry is a hero I love, but with Dire keyword his ability is rather limited.

Specific criticism may be disagreed with and unwelcomed -- but that's OK.  If it's reasonable to harshly criticize someone's deck, it's equally reasonable to harshly criticize someone's criticism.  But blanket dismissal of a deck (that someone else has already succeeded with) opens the question of whether the problem is the deck or the pilot.  Only telling us *why* something failed will help others and spawn discussion of the actual deck and the actual quest rather than meta-discussion about criticism, like this post.

It's really no use explaining the deck to people who criticize my criticism, so it's a waste of my energy.

I ended up beating it on the first attempt with a deck on RingsDB involving hero Gandalf,  lore Elrond, and leadership Denethor.  Fellowship sphere Frodo with the willpower boost was also used.  When I asked for a specific strategy for the deck, the creator said "no specific strategy."  Sure enough, he was right!  You just let the cards fall where they may and they took over for themselves.  One of the best, if not THE best, deck to beat the scenario.

I see two problem's with this:

First "if it's bad for me" is a touch ambiguous, and the "for me" is telling.

Second, can and should are two very different things.

Providing reasons on why the deck was not helpful (to you) would indeed be branded as criticism. Being branded as criticism is not a bad thing.

I kid you not. I actually laughed when I read this. Actually, I do feel like I can in good conscience obey this suggestion. If I ever do want to be a fascist totalitarian, I will most certainly do so elsewhere. Thank goodness I haven't done so here.

I would also encourage you to ask other members of this forum for their opinion on whether or not my posts indicate a fascist totalitarian state. Thank you for your time.

 

Maybe you should be a linguist or some kind of charlatan lawyer since you like to reason through things or provide "explanations" for somebody else's criticism when it's a real waste of time.  What REALLY made me laugh was "Thank you for time."  LOL  like, seriously?  Who the **** are you to just pop up out of nowhere and criticize criticism nonsensically (which is exactly what it is...nonsense)?  It's amazing how merely saying "this is a bad deck" can generate so many ridiculous responses.  Like who would have thought that so many *wasted* words would be typed just by saying "this is a bad deck"?  Man you people are sensitive af.  Must be a generational thing...

Also, my replies on this thread had nothing to do with you at all,  and "thanking me for my time" makes absolutely no sense.  I have nothing to be "thanked" for (especially since I'm not looking for thanks for anything), and nobody should be thanking you either. 

*notifications turned off, so anything you write will not be read by me, so please continue wasting your time since you have nothing better to do. I take great pleasure in denying you the satisfaction of me reading your senseless drivel.  Quest has been beaten.  End of story.  Final post.*

On the small chance you do read this, I was thanking you for reading my post, or, as you called it "senseless drivel." I thank you now for recommending that I pursue occupation as a lawyer or linguist.

This reminded me of something! If anyone wants a good laugh:

To me, a waste of energy is complaining about complainers instead of discussing decks.  Boring down on strategy is what interests me; meta-discussion about criticism is far less interesting.  The only reason making specific criticsm could be a "waste of your time" compared to meta discussion is if discussion of strategy interests you *less* than meta-discussion, or you don't actually have any specific criticism to make.

"One of the best, if not THE best, deck to beat the scenario" is a bold claim, considering you played it exactly once.  I can only find one published deck at ringsdb with Gandalf/Elrond/LoDenethor:

http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4636/ring-bearers-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/4636/ring-bearers-1.0]

I'm inclined to be charitable to decks with unique hero lineups, and compared to other Vilya decks this has a couple assets against this quest -- LoDenethor's scrying and far fewer allies than is typical with other Vilya decks.  But it's not designed for this quest, it was created for multiplayer use and there's a number of cards that aren't useful for this quest (Emery, 3x Errand-rider, Dark Knowledge, Galadhrim's Greetings).  As a multiplayer deck it's also avoiding unique attachments that could be used elsewhere (e.g. Light of Valinor, *certainly* worth at least a 1x for this quest.) For readying it has 3x Shadowfax and 1x UC, and the only willpower boost is Elrond's Counsel.  I'd think Fortitude tests would be an issue with this deck.  LOS Frodo gives you a 4 wp option if you can exhaust the ring (I used him against Mt. Doom also), but that'd have more value if you had Rosie Cotton and Fast Hitch in the deck to take advantage of his round-long willpower boost!

No wonder I was confused.  I misread LeDenethor as LoDenethor.  The actual deck used is much, much better:

Alternatively, you may grow up. Walking away and slamming the door to "make sure you have the last word" speaks volumes of immaturity. You come across as arrogant, confrontational and condescending. I would bet you're coming back to check out if the rest replied anything. It's a pity, because this forum is usually full of interesting discussions and people respecting each others' opinions while debating.

It looks to me he is not the sort of person with the will and kidness to be able to throw the ring. In view of this, I don’t think it can be considered that you truly throw the ring. You son of Isildur!

I think the line about throwing that fits here is: "FOOL OF A TOOK!!! 
Throw yourself in next time, and rid us of your stupidity!!"

this last page has been amusing on many levels... 

 - that wandalf wouldn't take the bait and instead patronized them into a tantrum...

 - that someone would pick this place to come and be an internet tough guy...

 - and that the same someone would use the whole 'get off my lawn' rant and yet still be like, 'uh, anyone got, uh, a deck i could use to uh, beat mountain of fire?...  but one that uh, doesn't suck...

you cant make this stuff up

And you can't make posts like this up either! Just hits the spot. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Some proper popcorn material for sure. Too bad he threw in the towel.

While I can understand the frustration of getting beaten again and again by the game (and especially Mt Doom), there is no need for calling someone else's deck terrible. There are no terrible decks, just terrible ways you can reveal the cards in that deck. Especially in such tough quests as this do you need a deck that is more finely tuned to the scenario, which is why Roka's deckbuilding series exists. 

Shame to see someone using such an aggressive tone in this otherwise top notch community. Hy hat goes off to the rest of the people here who tried to deal with the situation with reason, but sometimes there can be no victory against a mindset like that. Looking at other posts, this was not an isolated incident. Best to move on and look ahead to the games to come, perhaps one day a One Deck is published that he does like. 

Aa'menealla nauva calen ar'malta!

The best part for me was how the entirety of the criticism rested on the ambigious-to-the-point-of-meaningless adjective 'bad' and personal experience. In a constructive, co-operative context oriented around thinking together through problems, how could that sort of 'criticism' not be viewed as problematic!

I am suspicious in the most wonderful way regarding the timing of his quest completion :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
