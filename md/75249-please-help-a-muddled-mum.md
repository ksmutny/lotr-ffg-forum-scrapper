Hi All-

My daughter has decided that she wants this card game for Christmas. I know I need to get some sort of expansion for the core game, but which one? Some players say to go in order, but for the life of me, I can't figure out what that is. Could you help me out on what I am supposed to get besides the initial game? Many thanks!

Never mind. I have to place the order today…wish I would have gotten SOME input.

well this forum isnt the busiest, and its been having some problems recently, but incase you still want some input here is the order of the expansions. you dont need to get any. you can play the game with just the core.

Shadows of mirkwood cycle: (you can buy any of these with just core set)

1.hunt for gollum

2.conflict at the carrock

3.journey to rhosgobel

4.emyn muil

5.dead marshes

6.return to mirkwood

Khazad dum deluxe pack (needed to play the follow cycle)

dwarrowdelf cycle:

1.redhorn gate

2.road to rivendell

3.watcher in the water

4.the long dark

5.foundations of stone

6.shadow and flame

Hiers of numenor deluxe pack (following cycle not out yet)

 

then theres the two hobbit packs, one of which is out the other is not

you can buy them without the core set

generally the cycles get harder as you would imagine

my advice as always is go in order

Agreed with rich.

 

You just need the core to play (3 quests)

With the other expansions/packs you increase the pool of cards and allow your daughter to build better decks…

 

Go in order is the best because you will get the cards as they were released and be able to play the game without cards from latter packs/expansions (which turns to be an rather joyfull experience, but occasionaly difficult)

 

The Hobbit, unlike rich said, needs the Core set to be playable because it only as 5 hero cards and 45 player cards, so it will leave a deck unplayable (those 45 cards include 3 copies of each card, so you remain with 15 different cards)

 

As it is said in the expansion page:http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=2&esum=212 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=2&esum=212]

This is not a standalone set. A copy of The Lord of the Rings: The Core Set is required to play.

See third paragraph.

Otherwise, go in order of release, as Rich explained.
