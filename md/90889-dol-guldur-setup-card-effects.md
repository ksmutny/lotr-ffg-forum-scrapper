When setting up for Dol Guldur, the quest card says to "attach an encounter card to each objectove". Is this different from them being "revealed from the encounter deck". Does this affect what card effects take place? For example, if the card attach is "Doomed 1" or has "Surge" or has a When Revealed effect, do you resolve those during the setup?
