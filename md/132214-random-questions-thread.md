Just wondering... What do you guys think about having this thread as a place to put all of our random questions? Questions that you'd like answered, but you don't think are enough to warrant a whole new thread.

For example, I'll ask one that's been on my mind:

With the release of the Celduin Traveler, we now have both a Lore and a Spirit ally with the "Dale. Scout." traits. Do you think we'll get one for Tactics and Leadership too? And are there any people in the books that could become a Dale hero (besides Bard and Brand) that could possibly expand the trait?

Bain could be. But maybe I'd rather see a new FFG invented hero. I like those a lot. And yes, we'll probably see those versions. As the slight theme to them is that they have something to do with locations, it will stick to that i guess. For leadership maybe something with 'Response: After Dale Huntsman enters play, place one progress on a location for each ally you control.' And tactics 'Action: After you destroy an enemy, exhaust Veteran of The Battle to place 1 progress one each location in the staging area' (limit once per round) I hope for them to come at least. Love the Dales. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Some kind of FFG created feudal lord would be cool.
