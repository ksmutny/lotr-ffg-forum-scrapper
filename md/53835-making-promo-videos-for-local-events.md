So the store where I'm the D&D Event Organizer, and now unofficially the same for 'Lord of the Rings: The Card Game' is starting to really get some active players.  Our Facebook group has 11 people who have played it and want more action.  Half of them own at least one box set.  Then we have 5 or more not in our Facebook group who want to play it.  Hope we can break 20 members by the end of the year and have great organized events.  So for our first meetup which was last Monday, I made a quick promotional video.  I had an hour to make it and limited access to artwork.  I pretty much used clips from FFG official intro video to the game along with some music one of the films soundtrack.  If you'd like to see it, go to vimeo.com/willfuqua/demo-lotr [http://vimeo.com/willfuqua/demo-lotr]  I'll be taking it down shortly though due to me feeling uncomfortable with using clips from another person's work.  I've emailed FFG in hopes that they will help me get artwork to use in future promotional videos.  We'll see how that goes.  Hopefully I'll have a great video made for our next get together that's centered around the The Hills of Emyn Muil Adventure Pack release.  I'll share it with you guys after it's made.

Cheers,

Will Fuqua
