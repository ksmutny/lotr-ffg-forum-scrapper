sooo... dwarrowdelf.....what do we know so far....

1.rehorn gate- spoiled...caradhras and arwen

2.road to rivendell- spoiled....rivendell blade and orc raiders. also mention of rivendell player cards in the initial cycle spoiler....and elrond perhaps, erestor spoiled and would make sense to release in this one. also ellandan and elrohir would make sense

3.watcher in the water- spolied...tentacles and doors of durin

4.the long dark- spoiled.....ring mail and goblin warlord

5.?

6.? another hint at the balrog here on khazad leaflet. would make a good finale

cards spoiled in the cycle preview not listed above- orc ambush- seeing as elronds wife was ambushed and captured in the high pass of misty mountains im guessing road to rivendell for ambush

of course more dwarf cards throughout

do we know any heros yet? for some reason i want to say well be seeing pippin....im not sure why...has that been hinted at? or am i just imagining things

gwaihir has been spoiled in a piece of artwork and would make sense continuing on from the eagle theme

likely candidates are in my opinion:

-elrond

-ellandan

-elrohir

-Gwaihir

-any of thorins company alive at time that we havnt seen so lets see if i can remember them all

1.thorin- dead

2.fili- dead

3. kili- dead

4. balin- dead

5.dwalin- available

6. edit....mis remembered preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

7. bifur- ''

8.bofur

8.bombur

9.gloin- available

10. oin- dead

11.dori

12.nori

13.ori- dead

so post your ideas.........

Thalin was not part of the company. He was invented by FFG for there game Middle Earth Quest and is not in Tolkiens work.

 Bombur would be massiv, literally......as he is described as being so fat that 6 dwarves had to carry him around in his later days.

i wonder what his abilty could be.....i do think we'll see him though; thematically he could be a very fun hero

Ha, thanks for saying that. When I first saw Thalin I could´t figure out why he sounded familiar but then again I never heard of him. Superb name.

Also your memory is perfect. Look at your number 8 dwarves.

Probably something like: "Bombur cannot commit to a quest. Reduce all damage dealt to Bombur by 1." (his dwarven jelly rolls make him lazy, but protect him from injury lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif])

nice one haha....im trying to think of abilities that are plausible but would open up FFG to riducule for being offensive!

form what you said a "clock effect" might work with him, and it is something we haven't seen in this game yet....

A clock effect is a card effect that leaves the card tapped for more than one round at least. The simplest is a strong creature at low cost that comes in tapped and can not do anything for a full turn... (of the clock). The more complex ones are powerful abilities that are extremely strong, but the card don't uncap until a condition is met, like say a ally leaves play.

This guy being a big fat dwarf could do that... maybe have a huge defense like 4 or something... but then he can not untap unless you pay 2, though with UC around clock effects might not work on heroes.. Maybe if you had a rule that he can not have spirit attachments.. though not sure how you could fit that into the flow of the game .... still clock effects could be a cool addition to LoTRs-LCG

Hmmm... Exhaust bombur during combat.  Then choose an enemy engaged with you.  Enemy is snared for the rest of the phase.  (because bombur is sitting upon him.)

HAHA, genius. That´s exactly the same I wanted to write. Tough I would call it feinted.

The Orc Ambush treachery card is definitely with Road to Rivendell and there is a Lore dwarf ally coming, no idea what his stats are...

Game Trade Magazine has some spoilers for Redhorn Gate and Road to Rivendell. Redhorn Gate also had two new encounter cards, showing just the title and the artwork. The first one is Celebdil: http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Zirak-zigil [http://lotr.wikia.com/wiki/Zirak-zigil]
it's a beautiful picture of a sharp spike of a mountain. it has 3 threat and what looks like 7 quest points. It's also unique, like Caradhras. I'm thinking they might start in play.

 

The other was a Treachery Card titled "Freezing Cold" with a picture of a pissed of looking dwarf, his beard covered in snow. It looked like it had the trait Snow

Btw, the 13 dwarves are (yes, there are 13 dwarves, Bilbo is not counted in the 13):

Bifur
Bofur
Bombur
Ori
Dori
Nori
Oin
Gloin
Fili
Kili
Balin
Dwalin
Thorin

Also, I always forget that Thalin was a new character from FFG. They've done a great job with keeping the feel of everything so close to LotR. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

it took me 5 times of cross referencing to spot my mistake- i have actually got all 13 there.....i did however put the number 8 twice - there really should be a head banging smily on here...talk about confusing ones self lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]
