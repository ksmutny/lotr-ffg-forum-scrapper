When fierce Southrons forces one enemy in the straging area to make an immediate attack, can other player defend this attack with centinel?

My doubt is because it has the Peril keyword.

Other questions similar: can other player kill the enemy during the attack, for example, with Hands-upon-the-Bow?

While resolving the staging of a card with the Peril keyword, other players cannot take Actions.  So you certainly couldn't use Hands Upon the Bow, and I don't think you could use Sentinel either.

I'd have to reread the rules on Peril, but if it is only you cannot take actions I see no reason why sentinel wouldn't be allowed.

Peril says:

When a player reveals an encounter card with the Peril keyword, he must resolve the staging of that card on his own without conferring with the other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card's staging.

 

Is the act of declaring a defender actually an action?  I agree that Hands Upon the Bow would not be legal.

The only thing that might stop the Sentinel is "must resolve the staging of that card on his own..." which isn't exactly well-defined so who knows what it might mean. I'd let the Sentinel defend.

"without conferring with other players" is also kind of interesting..

 

So, assuming sentinel is legal...

 

I can't ask you to use your sentinel.  But you could volunteer?

I may be wrong, but I think when it says that other players can't take any actions I don't think it meant to limit it to actions printed as card abilities, but also frameworks actions. If that is the case then other players cannot block immediate attacks.

I also played it that way.

 

A Little off Topic, but i really like this quest. The first time i played it(two handed!) i was killed outright by around 14 archery damage. I didn't know the Cards and really had to laugh when revealing one archer, two *man of harad* and *two arrows thick in the air*. I shuffeld thouroughly afterwards =)

I´m with the Duke on this one: actions is meant to encompass more that just the action-action. So no sentinel.

This is how we are playing it and will continue to do so unless a dev says otherwise.

I'm not so sure.  The fact that it says you can't take actions or trigger responses makes me think that it's referring to the printed text of action or response.

I'll go ahead and send the question in, just to get an official answer.

I think using a sentinel blocker for a player who is meant to "resolve the staging of that card on his own" would betray the spirit of the peril keyword...

The question I asked: 

Greetings! With regards to the peril keyword and the treachery card "Fierce Southrons" - if the option is chosen where "each enemy in the staging area makes an immediate attack against you", can your team mates use their sentinel characters to block for you? The rule for peril is: When a player reveals an encounter card with the Peril keyword, he must resolve the staging of that card on his own without conferring with the other players. The other players cannot take any actions or trigger any responses during the resolution of that card's staging. Thanks

 

The response I got:

The peril keyword prevents other players from interrupting the staging of Fierce Southrons, but once the attack has been initiated the staging is done. When an enemy makes an attack outside of the combat phase, you observe all the steps of ‘resolving enemy attacks’ and the action windows between each step. So, it is possible for another player to declare a sentinel character as the defender and to take actions in-between those steps.

Cheers,
Caleb

Hmm.  So not only can you sentinel, but you could still do actions and responses in combat, like Hasty Stroke.  I mean, that feels right to me because otherwise cards like Fierce Southrons could be a quick game ender.  But the wording on Peril has some room for improvement.

I'm officially giving up on trying to predict what officially rules are regarding vague wording. I get 20% right, at best.

Yeah I'd really like to see a full technical write up of the game.  Not only would it really help us players with the game logic, but could help developers follow a constant logic with new cards too.

 

Even if it changes some previous rulings, consistent logic would really improve the player experience during growth from a starter kit to buying expansions.

 

I mean - even My Little Pony has one, wouldn't you love this for lotr? [http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/mylittleponyccg/images/0/0a/MLP_CCG_Comprehensive_Rules_%28v3.1%29.pdf]
