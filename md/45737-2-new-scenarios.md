Hi all,

Two new scenarios here for your perusal, feedback welcome:

The Lost Road (for a solo hero):

I love both of them! The concepts are solid and they seem doable but challanging (especially the multiplayer one)
The only falws Id like to point out is that some of the rules for the solo quest are a little ambigous or, erm, unofficial? For example "also take out Legolas" kind of gives away that its home made, no offence =P

More importantly "carry out the staging element every other turn" is poorly worded. I assume you mean every 2nd turn? Also do you mean the whole staging step is skipped or that its still in the Quest-phase framework but you simply dont stage enemy cards? This might not be that important now but what if in later expansions we get Staging Actions? Get what I mean?

The 2nd scenario is worded a little strange too. The first time I read it I thought that Legolas only came in for that scenario, then I realised it means that he comes in and only provides resources of your chosen sphere. Maybe just get rid of "for this adventure only"?

The only other inconsistancy I noticed is that in the last scenario the ork that the player searches for isnt random. This means that players will have no incentive (apart from their desired level of difficulty) to pick a stronger enemy than they have to. I assume this is modeled on the Spiders of Mirkwood thing where you can look for any spider? That works because players have a choice between taking out Ungoliant's Spawn Now and confront it (to beat the quest) or leave it till later because at the time its too strong and take out a weak spider instead, hoping theyll be recovered by the time the Spawn comes out. Your scenario doesnt have that choice. Maybe if you introduced a mandatory boss encounter? (Like a Beastmaster or Chieftan Uthnak) or just made the ork selection random? Ie. "Take out all the ork enemies from the encounter deck and pick one at random, replace the rest into the deck and shuffle it"

Wow, sorry, I didnt meant to poke this many holes! I honestly didnt think it would take this much writing to point out the things I thought were off. If its any consolation the multiplayer scenario is Tight =P

Thanks a lot for the work you put in! Ill probably print these off some time soon xD

Thanks for your feedback mate!  To address your concerns:

It's clearly a fanmade adventure so I have no problem with people "spotting" that, as it were, with the wording for removing Legolas.  It's kind of a cool mechanic too when he comes in to save the day.

Every other turn means every second turn, so your assumption is correct.  Not sure how else you could interpret it?  The staging wording is taken from the Anduin scenario and is intended the same way.

And you're correct, in the last stage, the orc is not random (like the Spiders adventure), so you can pick a nice easy one to kill.  You'll still have whatever else is in the staging area though, so it's just an extra little challenge, hence the difficulty level = 3.  Your resources should be pretty sparse by this point though with just one hero (or two heroes with Legolas).  If you feel up to taking on Chieftain Ufthak at this point by all means tweak the adventure how you like!

## 4 [DerBarchen on April 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=458679)

Cools! To be honest I just nit-pick a lot. Ive designed several (half baked) game systems over the years so I try to sound as proffesional as possible when writing, it should be perfect for most other players that arent OCD =)

Hole poking aside though I think the two Scenarios are really cool, and will definately add more replayability to an already diverse game.
I think youve probably touched one one of this game's greatest strengths. The fact that the game is dictated by the scenario rather than your opponent's deck as in other games means that community made quests etc. could very well play a Huge part. You could be a pioneer of sorts =p

I hope FFG is paying atention, I think this might be the first card game with community made "mods"

## 5 [DerBarchen on April 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=458680)

Oh also, forgot to say, I love the exposition. Theres great tallent in there!

## 6 [NinjaDorg on April 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=459226)

 Hah, cheers mate.  Seems to me the scenarios will be the easiest thing to mod as it doesn't matter how they look when printed.  Maybe the same for heroes as you don't generally shuffle them into your decks.  The hero/encounter decks are another matter entirely though, especially when trying to keep them balanced...

## 7 [Magus Edge on April 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=459643)

 I really enjoyed both of these.  The solo adventure only got a couple of plays as I like having more resources (more ability to combo cards/heroes).  The group adventure has gotten the most play with the second adventure from the core set.  I've tested every solo sphere deck and a couple of dual sphere decks.  The guaranteed heavy hitters of The Old Forest make it difficult for Lore to cope if they don't get a decent draw.  Leadership sphere never lost, nor did Willpower.  Tactics got bogged down (no pun intended) by the dual threat of The East Bight/The Brown Lands and tapped out some three games in a row. 

Thanks a ton for putting these together and please let us know if you do any more in the future!

That's great, thanks for playing them!  If you posted this on BGG I'd give you some GeekGold/thumbs but there's no equivalent here.  And well done for beating The Old Forest with mono sphere decks - I've still not managed that yet.  Do you have more than one core set by any chance?

I have a couple more on the way (group quests only) so I'll be sure to keep you posted.  In the meantime you can just keep an eye on my blog for updates.

Thanks again, it's nice to know other people are enjoying them too!  cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

 I do, in fact, have 2 core sets.  If you would like me to test further I can cut my decks down to mono-set builds.  I can also post deck lists as they aren't full legit 50 card decks (there are numerous cards in different spheres that are utterly useless in single player play.  I see no reason to include them).  I'm also almost done testing my own adventure, so I'm hoping to post that to BGG soon.

Hey, that's cool - I'd rather you play them how you wish, especially if you have two sets - no need to split them down on my account!  Look forward to seeing your adventure, hopefully you'll also come up with one that people like me with just one core set can use too...

## 13 [DerBarchen on April 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=460567)

Ive printed them out and stuck them into card sleeves so they can be used along with the rest of my quests! I think making your own quests will be one of the things my gaming group will like most about the game, it feels very Dungeon-mastery =P

I was wondering what software/effects you used to make the quest cards. I was thinking of using a combination of MS Paint (dont laugh, its effective when used right) and GIMP for when I try my hand at it

## 14 [Magus Edge on April 29, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=460934)

 I'm using those exact tools right now.  I'm finding the text doesn't work very well in either of these programs so I'll probably get the images all set, convert to jpg and add the text on top of it using Microsoft Project.  I'm hoping to post something soon.

Aye I found the same problem! In order to make this comic [http://petulantbooster.tumblr.com/tagged/RoyalWedding] I copied the picture into microsoft word and added the text, then I copied that back into paint (Using PrintScreen since a direct copy paste has formating issues) It worked great and the only reason its blury is because Tumblr has weird image limitations, it wasnt blury untill I uploaded. Then again this one [http://petulantbooster.tumblr.com/tagged/BoroStark] worked fine with the writing tool in Paint. Are you trying to get the authentic font or whats the problem?

Whats Microsoft Project? =P

Good to see you here, NinjaDorg!

One of our Polish forum members found your blog and informed us about your great work. What can we say? Impressive!

Many Polish LoTR LCG players would like to have this sets of adventures in our native language. Will you let us do it? I can do this in Photoshop, but the result will be mediocre without appropriate fonts, templates or at least specific graphics you used. That means poor quality and too many differences. Would you be willing to share with us these templates and/or graphics? Or I can send you a translated text, which you could put on cards.

We will respect any of your decisions.

Totally meant Microsoft Publisher.  A buddy of mine is showing me an easier way to do this and I'll probably post on that later.  We're almost done with the adventure cards.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 Just posted the first adventure.  Awful flavor text but it should be workable.  I think the difficulty is somewhere around 6.  We're working on a printable pdf that has the cards in the correct size.  Oversight at the beginning on our part.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I'll second the previous request for Photoshop files, fonts, etc.  I'd like to take a stab at making some scenarios, and that would be a huge time saver (and look better than I'd be able to hack it together).

## 21 [DerBarchen on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=461299)

Wow good work magus! Thats really cool. Ill make sure to print that off when I get the chance. You still didnt mention what you used to make them >.>

Aye, Im thinking if someone took the time to develop a "tool box" or guidline of instructions how to make them with minimal effort it would really help the community. I will get right on it after I try out several freeware programs (Photoshop = $$)

## 22 [NinjaDorg on April 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=461416)

 I've never used GIMP, etc so can't comment on them, but I'll try and post my PSDs to my 4shared account if and when I get the chance.

psd files are files from Adobe Photoshop, but you can open them with some free graphic programs as well. Like Gimp ^^

 

Thanks for the files, ninjadorg. The scenarios are a great idea and I'm tempted to make some myself. One question: which fonts did you use?

I carved out the template from the uploaded previews and went from there, splicing the card icons into one file, de-saturating the art colours, replicating the text FX on the Progress number and Titles, etc.

Thanks mate, you're obviously achieving more victories with this game than our group is!  I wanted more quests that were harder than Mirkwood but not as deadly as Dol Guldur, and which showcased the varying encounter cards, hopefully these scenarios hit that target.  One more scenario on its way soon too...

As others have mentioned PSDs are PhotoShop files which you can apparently use in GIMP (free software I believe), although I have no experience of GIMP.  And there are no dumb questions, just dumb answers - hopefully this isn't one of them!

Mentor Sans Std is not the official font for this game (it was just my personal choice) so you can quite easily replace it with one of your own if you don't already have it.  cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

I'm close to the testing phase for my first scenario. What fonts did you use for the main text? Is this MentorSans Std, too? I can't find one looking good in a small font-size.

Yep, it's all Mentor Sans.  If you're really struggling just use Arial or Times New Roman - at least they're readable.

Thank you very much, it takes a lot of time to write a single report, actually. Nevertheless, I do my best for supporting good games, in the hope that the editors would produce more cool stuff to expand these products lines.

Moreover, I could not have made this session report without your awesome initial work. I am sure it takes a while to design a single card. And it was so fun to play a solo quest.

Best regards.

Greetings everyone,

Another session report on NinjaDorg's Lost Road quest has been published on freourslc.blogspot.com/ [http://freourslc.blogspot.com/]

This time, I used a legal deck (without Unexpected Courage) according to the F.A.Q. related to the considered scenario.

For the second time, Aragorn wanders alone along the Lost Road [http://ratdorg.blogspot.com/2011/04/lord-of-rings-card-game-scenario-lost.html] in order to accomplished the quest proposed by NinjaDorg [http://ratdorg.blogspot.com/]. Equipped with a legal deck including Leadership-sphere only cards, will the lone hero be able to overcome the relentless wrath of the tremendous Hummerhorns drawn on turn 1?

Hey NinjaDorg!

 

I just played your first scenario after printing it out and laminating it yesterday and I must say it was great fun and a challenge!

Suprisingly we won quick quickly, although we encountered some really super nastly stuff like a hill troll in the first round and quite at the end this super mean treachery card where all the players discard all of their event cards! wow, never saw that card before....

Anyway, because of the high damage of Gilmli and Legolas ability, we progressed extremely quickly.

 

We played with one core set, my wife had Aragorn, Dunhere and Eowen and me Gilmi, Legolas and Glorfindel.

I was really lucky to have gondorian spearman, Gandalf, quick strike, swift stirke, Dwarfen Axe and a citadel plate on my first draw on my hand!

Great game, will try the rest of your tale in the next few days!

Great to hear it Iver - thanks for posting.

I'm currently working on another scenario, but then Gollum arrived last night so after 5 plays of that I'll be incorporating all the new stuff into this scenario too.  Such a cool game...

 Sorry guys, wasn't trying to rub it in.

I reviewed The Hunt For Gollum here if you're interested:

Something to read till it drops through your letterbox...
