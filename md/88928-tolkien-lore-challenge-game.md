# [Tolkien Lore Challenge (game)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/)

## 1 [richsabre on August 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=846481)

so with the forum now dieing rather from the recent explosion of news, i thought it was time for another lore thread. this time i am trying to make it fun....so i thought a bit of a forum quiz.

 

like all my threads, some take off, some dont, so i shall just run this until it dies.

 

so- basic lore quiz. i ask a question, first person to correctly answer asks the next and so on

 

any tolkien book on middle earth is fine, though probably stay away from unfinished tales and so on as not a lot of people have those

 

here is my question: how far did Gandalf estimate the distance from the west to east gates of Moria was ? (in a straight line)

I think Gandalf counts it at most 40 miles, am I right ?

> I think Gandalf counts it at most 40 miles, am I right ? 

You have the honor sir.

 

'How long is that going to take us? ' asked Frodo.

'I cannot say,' answered Gandalf. 'It depends on many chances. But going straight, without mishap or losing our way, we shall take three or four marches, I expect. It cannot be less than forty miles from West-door to East-gate in a direct line, and the road may wind much.'

Fingolfin, before being killed by Morgoth, left him something to remember ... what was that ?

Who in Middle-Earth, at the time of the War of the Ring, had the power to *create* a Palantir stone?

## 11 [Whitman on August 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847070)

I'm guessing no-one?

## 12 [Ellareth on August 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847078)

> Who in Middle-Earth, at the time of the War of the Ring, had the power to *create* a Palantir stone?

 

A being that is able to create Palantir during War of the Ring? Oh boy this is tough.

Palantir was made by the Eldars of West, so certainly a skilled High Elf or servants of Aule comes to my mind.

But Celebrimbor, greatest elven smith of 3rd age, lacked the knowledge to even create the Rings of Power without aid of Sauron at first, so probably safe to assume Celebrimbor couldn't do it (his version of Elf Stone is mentioned to be less effective than original as well, so I highly doubt he can replicate Palantir).

It is mentioned by Gandalf that Palantir was above Saruman and Sauron as well, 2 Maiars that were in service of Aule. So it's probably safe to assume no other Maiar in Middle Earth at the end of Third Age could create as well (including Gandalf).

 

So with Maiars of Aule and Elven Smithes out of picture, only other being that I can think of that comes even remotely close is Tom Bombadil.

But there is no evidence that Tom Bombadil has power to replicate Palantir, and he certainly wouldn't want to... besides we don't even know what Tom Bombadil is (... if we disregard how Tom is obviously Witch-King in disguise XD).

 

Other far-fetched ideas included Galadriel and Glorfindel, they are the only known 1st Age Elves residing in Middle-Earth. They are both golden haired and therefore has Vanyar blood in them as well as Noldor, and are possibly the wisest Elves around.... yet they were warrior and ruler, not smithes.

 

I feel like this is some kind of trick question, with *create* being emphasized...

either way I'm stomped and out of ideas.

Crazy shot, but since they were supposed to be made by Feanor - if I'm not mistaken- it could be either Galadriel (who was there when they where made I think) or Elrond as a distant grandson who knew the secret ...

Maybe it is just because of me not being a native speaker, but didn't Fingolfin just stabbed at Morgoth's foot, instead of chopping it off?

 

A very nice thread, by the way.

Ellareth's post was great, but it was a trick question. Gandalf states that not even Sauron possessed the ability to create a Palantir. That knowledge no longer existed in Middle-Earth at the time of the War of the Ring. It is your turn, Whitman.

## 19 [Whitman on August 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847305)

OK, here goes...

 

Whose death marked the end of the War of the Ring and how did this individual die?

 

Hope that's not too easy!

You are correct, Ileimmoen. The word that Tolkien used was "hewed", but I always chose to interpret that as "took a big chunk of demon flesh out of" because it makes the battle that much more epic. I really hope that FFG can one day secure the licensing rights to the First Age (Silmarillion, Unfinished Tales, Children of Hurin) stories as they are some of my absolute favorites.

## 21 [Troymk1 on August 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847311)

Sauron.  The destruction of the One Ring was his downfall. He had bound his spirit to it, which is actually how he managed to return from his demise in the Second Age.

## 22 [Troymk1 on August 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847314)

Q: What Did the nations of Arthedain, Cardolan and Rhudaur comprise?

## 23 [Whitman on August 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847318)

Hold your horses, Troy! Not all of Sauron's forces were vanquished when the One Ring was destroyed.

I didn't really think it was still the War of the Ring, but sure.  Saruman. Murdered by Grima Wormtongue in the SHire. 

## 28 [Whitman on August 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847346)

Gríma was then shot down by Hobbit archers as he tried to flee. Wormtongue's death was the last in the War of the Ring.

For my part, it is the one I love the most and though I have more than fifteen years to read it I remember a lot of stuff 

I hope that during winter I'll be able to read it again to refresh knowlendge. Also I believe that now I will get a better glimpse than when I last read it, when I was just finishing highschool and just beggining to learn about Tolkien 

## 45 [richsabre on August 22, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847661)

i have only read it properly a few times.....i admit it is a huge hole in my tolkien knowledge, though i do not mind that at all. i love the material in the third age far more. i know many tolkien fans prefer the silmarillion over lotr, and i can see why that may be, they are very different of course

## 46 [lleimmoen on August 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=848029)

I am sorry for the delay. I have to say I love the Silmarillion lore, the uncertain state of many affairs (mostly due to the limited time the Professor had to uncover it all) makes them mostly all the more intriguing. I cannot say I prefer the Silmarillion over the Lord of the Rings (or even the Hobbit), I like them all as a single unifying piece of beauty, tragedy and passion.

 

An easy one now, what is the name of the most famous horse of the Valar?

Makes me want to read The Silmarillion.

## 51 [Troymk1 on August 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=848395)

I have read it 3-4 times and actually my mate Davethecop and I listened to the audiobook while we did our Texas roadtrip. 

 

It's TRUE high fantasy,  on the same plateau as the sagas & myths of old    (The intimate study of which Tolkien based much of this milieu upon! )

 

In direct contrast is the homeliness and identifiable traits of the hobbits and dwarves of his more celebrated works. Ones that an audience can readily identify with. 

 

The characters of the Silmarillion bestride the stage like unto gods (and some actually ARE) Whereas Bilbo, Frodo etc are much like us and as a Literary device the latter is much more successful. 

## 52 [Whitman on August 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=848400)

He uses the hobbits in the same way in both The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. They are, above all, ordinary. They are not kings or wizards or mighty warriors. They are gardeners and poachers (and fools), the perfect point of access to this world.

Dior is the son of Beren and Luthien. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure that's right.

Here's my question: How many Valar are there total (counting Melkor), and who is their chief?

Also to go along with that: Which of the Valier dwells with the chief of the Valar?

## 59 [danpoage on August 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=848644)

14 (7 male and 7 female), the chief among the Valar is Manwe and his wife is Varda (aka. Elbereth Gilthoniel).

## 60 [danpoage on August 23, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=848649)

Tom Bombadil. The elves call him Iarwain Ben-adar. The interwebs call him The Witch King.

## 64 [danpoage on August 24, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=848674)

Nope. Just to clarify, Galadriel herself refers to this being as "Eldest".

Bree.

 

Though I think there may be an alternative version, in which they meet at the crossroad instead of the Prancing Pony? Still I think Bree applies.

 

If I'm right, I post this (otherwise disregard), it has multiple answers: Who is the Elf that helps Túrin on his way to Nargothrond? Where does the Elf escape from prior to meeting Túrin? And what tool helps him achieve that?

> Who is the Elf that helps Túrin on his way to Nargothrond? Where does the Elf escape from prior to meeting Túrin? And what tool helps him achieve that?

 

Phew! This was a hard one. I think the elf was Gwindor, son of Guilin, who escaped from Angband using a Feanorian Lamp.

What is the name of the king who ordered weapons from Erebor but the delivery never took place because of the interference of Smaug?

 

[A hint: this name was at one point considered for the character of Gandalf]

## 90 [Whitman on August 26, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=850772)

Wow! This was a hard one. Bladorthin is the king you mean, according to Wikipedia.

Ok, I am glad I created something as difficult as you would have to reach for the Sauron's web. It is there in the book, these little references were always so intriguing to me. But it was indeed the internet where I found out that the name was originally meant for Gandalf but survived into the published version in this one little note. Your turn, sir!

By the end of the Third Age, how many of the first ents remained and what were their names?

## 93 [richsabre on August 27, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=851200)

How many of the Palantiri survived beyond the War of The Ring? (assume any in the enemy's possesion were lost)

 

Bonus- How were the other stones lost?

Weathertop Stone and Annuminas Stone were sunk beneath Ocean.

Osgiliath Stone sunk to bottom of Anduin.

Ithilien Stone was possibly destroyed when Minas Ithil was sacked or was taken by Sauron and possibly been destroyed at the destruction of Barad-dur due to destruction of One Ring.

Minas Tirith Stone was burned with Denethor and only shows Denethor's burning hands unless the user has unusually high will power.

Orthanc Stone was claimed by Aragorn, and came to no harm as far as I know.

Elostirion Stone is still on top of Elven Tower, looking West across the Ocean.

 

So I'd say 3 (Minas Tirith, Orthanc, Elostirion) Palantiri survived, but only 1 remained for the purpose of viewing (unless you are strong enough see anything but dieing Denethor with Minas Tirith Stone).

Yay, finally all the lurking paid off XD.

You probably read that in Unfinished Tales, apparantly that one is the master stone among the Palantiri of Gondor.

 

A question in honour of new Delux expansion we are going to get:

What was Saruman's (later proved to be) fatal strategical mistake on his invasion of Rohan?

And which two Rohirrims contributed to it?

 

Edit: Not counting disregard for Ents.

After defeating Theodred, Saruman delayed his invasion of the Westfold. Gandalf made the most of this delay, breaking Saruman's spell on Theoden and persuading the king to retreat to Helm's Deep.

## 101 [Nickpes on August 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=852139)

Concentrating on killing Theodred rather than tottaly destroying the army of Rohan?

## 102 [lleimmoen on August 28, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=852161)

And I believe the two Rohirrim that were most instrumental in the successful outcome of the battle were Erkebrand and Grimbold, saving most of their men for the upcoming war (though of course others were notable participants, among those named was Elfhelm another famous champion).

Correct.

Had Saruman immediately pressed his victory he could've taken Hornburg before reinforcements from Edoras arrived and perhaps even take Edoras itself before Gandalf's arrival.

 

I had Grimbold and Elfhelm in mind for two Rohirrims due to the fact they were the commanding officers during second Battle of the Fords of Isen, but I guess Erkenbrand could be credited as well since he was technically the commanding officer of Grimbold's forces even though he was not present for the Battle.

 

so once again it is your turn lleimmoen.
