...for card previews, adventure pack previews, or expansion previews?

 

I wish there was like a regular day that updates get posted -- bi weekly on Wednesday? Or something? A little part of me dies each time I see no updates for this game.

ditto to what richsabre said. Not enough previews FFG.

Guilty.  I keep scrounging for a scrap of a preview or teaser for new cards.

I don't come to the site to deliberately check for news, but it happens automatically after logging out that you end up on the main page and see the news headlines.

I do all the time. All the other LCG's have a regular day I am sure in a bit LotR will too.

 I lurk the FFG forums for multiple games for hours daily. Unemployed college student ftw! In all honesty I should study for finals, but instead I'm lurking the aGoT rules forum. Or reading the discussions about LOTR.

 

So Super Guilty.

Secretly hoping for news every day :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Why not a weekly card of the week spotlight? FFG does it for Call of Cthulhu, Warhammer Invasion and Game of thrones, so why not for Lord of the Rings?

It will get a regular weekly spot for updates and cards of the week but give them a chance lol. The games only just come out.

Just proves how hyped people are about this LCG :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Before the game was released, we recieved teasers and updates that made me suffer waiting for the game.  Now I'm suffering from lack of teasers.

Maybe they're still looking for someone to write them? I think one of the LotR playtesters will have to volunteer.
