I just wanted to revisit HfG and suddenly I came in doubt. I drew a clue card. It's guarded so I reveal the next card to guard it. It is a doom and surge treachery and thus is discarded after resolved. Now, how was it with the surged card again. Is it:

A. replacing the treachery card and guards the clue?

B. just to be placed I'm the staging area?

Also, if you ever draw an enemy/location card with surge to guard an objective what happens to that second card I'm general? Can an objective be guarded by more than one card?

It's B, the first card drawn after the Objective card becomes the "Guard". Cards that were surged into do not interact with the objective card. So there will never be more than one card guarding an objectiv (under normal circumstances)

Okay. Thought so but played it the other way just to not take the easy way out. I won anyway but it's nice to be sure you did it right :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] thanks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
