I'm sure I'm behind the curve here, but me and my gaming buddy found Sting, Orcrist, and Glamdring. I used Thalin (to get rid of the crows), Eowyn, and Hama with Eagles. My friend (Couve_Timber) used Legolas, Beravor, and Frodo. We managed to find the Key and explore the cave one turn before killing the biggest troll. Felt great, so we moved on to the goblins, and got creamed. Anyone else find the treasure yet?

Lol had to have a laugh at this post. I'm sure I aged a little when I found the troll key on the bottom of the encounter deck lol. Found it now though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

He's talking about We Must Away Ere Break of Day, the first quest in the Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill box.  If you meet certain requirements above and beyond the actual victory requirements, you earn the right to include Treasure cards in your deck for other scenarios in that box and in On the Doorstep quests.  They're great cards, too-- only catch is that you have to use the same group of heroes that you were using when you 'discovered' the treasures.

This happened to me at least 2 games trying to find the treasure XD. I've found this quest to be much easier multiplayer. Just the opposite for Down to Goblin Town though.
