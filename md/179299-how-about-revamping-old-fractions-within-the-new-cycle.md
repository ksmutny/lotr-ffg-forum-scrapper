Well, mostly the title says it all.

 

It won't need many new cards, but to get a new spin to old fractions (like Outlands, Dwarfs or Eagles) I would apprechiate e.g. one new card per fraction and cycle!

(ok, there was Gwaihir in *** and lately a Gimli ally, but .. thats not enough.. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] )

 

Also, Isengard could get a boost! (new Valor effect and doomed keyword, anyone?! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

 

What do you guys think?

The next cycle wil probably take place in North-East (Mirkwood, Dale, Erebor, Iron mountains,....). Or I would think so, it is the last part of the Middle-earth well explored by books and not by this game (or not that much, Shadows of Mirkwood was somewhat there).And this is an excellent opportunity. 

So Thranduil (I personally really really hope for him. He and Cirdan are characters I miss the most) for Silvan elfs, more dwarves (Dain's son? ) who live there, Eagles, Dale, more Beornings (with Grimbeorn), Woodland men? (Or even Roac or other ravens?  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] more creatures for Radagast)

Or new Radagast hero himself? 

 

****...now you made me exited for things do not even exist  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
