So decided to jump back into my saga expansions today and discovered i some how lost my third questcard for Journey in the Dark. Hall of Beorn, Card Game DB, and all other card searches don't seem to have the card. Most i found was the 3a side on the box description on the main FFG site. If someone could fill me in on the 3b side that would be great!
