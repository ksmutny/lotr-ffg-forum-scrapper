# [Explorer&#039;s Almanac and Market Square](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217248-explorers-almanac-and-market-square/)

Who, if anyone, raises his threat if progress is placed onto a location in the staging area as a result of Explorer's Almanac while Market Square is in play?  It seems a bit odd to me that the wording is "after a player places...progress" and not "after a player card effect places...progress" on Market Square. 

 

1) The first player

2) The player who controls Explorer's Almanac

3) The player who physically takes tokens from the bank and puts them on the location (basically player's choice)

4) The player who convinced everyone it was a good idea to place the progress on the location

5) No one

6) Other

It has to be whoever controls the attachment.

> It has to be whoever controls the attachment.  

While this is what I would do if I was playing, but why? The attachment itself, doesn't place any progress.  It just provides the avenue.  Is it because the passive effect (choice) on Explorer's Almanac can technically, only be utilized by the player who controls it?

 

Questing successfully is what causes the placement of progress and at that point, any player can place the progress.

 

Perhaps no one has to raise his threat because the questing successfully progress placement isn't a "player", but a built in framework effect.

 

I think that it is probably #2 or #5.  Both make sense to me.

I'd argue on the fact that even though it is a passive effect, it is still optional and as the controller of the attachment, only that person can choose to enable the effect.  So you are choosing to put progress on that location or you are choosing not to.  Either way, it is your choice through your own card effect, so that is why I'd say it has to be the controller.

I'd vote for other: everyone raises their threat.  I'd think that if you place progress after questing successfully, that is a function of all players as a group, rather than one specific player.

Nope! I forgot to send in the question.  I just sent it in now, though.

> Hi Chris,
> 
> Placing progress from questing successfully is a framework action that happens automatically as a result of questing successfully, and Explorer’s Almanac simply redirects that progress to a location. So in essence, the game is placing that progress on the location and no one raises their threat from Market Square.

Awesome! I was so hoping this was the ruling!  I really like Explorer's Almanac.
