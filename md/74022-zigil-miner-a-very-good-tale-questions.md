 1. How to make Zigil Miner work better? Put cards at the same cost into one deck?

2.  Exhaust 2 allies you control to shuffle your deck and discard the top 5 cards. Put up to 2 allies discarded by this effect into play under your control.

The total cost of the allies put into play cannot exceed the total cost of the allies exhausted to pay for this effect.

What does "the total cost" mean? Does power symbols matter?

1. Putting cards with the same cost works, and a better combo is with Imladris Stargazer [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_imladris-stargazer-fos.jpg] (FoS 106).

2. "Cost" is only the number on the top-left corner (the number of resources you need to pay when you play it from your hand).  Since there are two allies, so the total cost is the sum of the costs of those two allies.
