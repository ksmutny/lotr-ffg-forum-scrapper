Can one use Gandalf's Staff (or the various other player cards that enable discarding of shadow cards) to discard shadow cards when it's Night in The Wastes of Eriador?

 

Nightfall states, "Encounter card effects cannot be canceled," but the action of Gandalf's Staff is phrased, "...or discard a shadow card from a non-unique enemy." No mention of cancellation, per se, so I assumed you could use it for this function. Was I right?

 

(...because, dangit, I don't want to annul my victory. I managed to survive *four* straight attacks from the Pack Leader due to drawing Northern Warg as a shadow card thrice in a row, and literally all of the damage I did to it was from Descendant of Thorondor's Response effect, which made it a hugely entertaining win.)

Yep, you can discard shadow effects with the Staff at night. Well-earned victory!

Yes you can. You not cancel the effect id shadow card, you just discard a ahadow card. No problem about

Gandalf can do almost anything.

> Gandalf can do almost anything.

 

 

Yes. I've found the shadow card discarding is the best ability on the staff.
