My shop is not running the adventure.  I asked about it and they said they have a lot of LOTR players, but most come in, pick up their packs, and disappear until the next pack is out.

I also wonder if this isn't a sort of test for a Sherlock Holmesish LCG.

Looks great. Really looking forward to the event.

I feel ya. On my local web stroe LotR LCG is listed as a "Hit!" (meaning a lot of purchases), but when I asked da owner about setting up the event - he simply said that he won't do this and he will not discuss this matter any further.

Maybe there is bad blood between him and FFG.

My store agreed to get do the Fellowship Event for me and my friends. I have no idea if any of the other locals play the game since I only ever see them playing warhammer and mtg and it will be weird staying to play instead of just leaving after picking up our packs.

I wonder if there is a common reason (other than "lack of interest") why stores might decide to not host these events.

 

Of course, LCGs are never going to be as pofitable to them as CCGs like Magic. But I think co-op games like LotR may be even more problematic. Even though they may have many fans, and make lots of sells, I suspect people overall buy co-op expansions at a slower rate than they do with the competitive ones. Competitive players tend to want to expand their cardpools as rapidly and as fully as possible, while that's not as necessary to enjoy playing something like LotR.

 

There could be darker reasons too... Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for a store to claim they are hosting such an event, only to actually not hold an event and just claim/sell the swag. Such "business practices" have been responsible for me dropping two of my FLGSs over the years.

Is there a list of stores that I can peruse to find one in my area or do I just need to call around?

Is it possible to get this if your FLGS is not participating?

## 11 [Bullroarer Took on November 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192483-join-the-fellowship/?do=findComment&comment=1876688)

They will be available POD eventually.

Just not Legolas or the play mat =(

If anyone ends up with a spare copy of this quest (with or without alt art legolas and playmats) for any reason I would pay handsomely for it!

What's the selling point to a local FLGS to run such an event when they don't sell the LotR LCG product? I offered to pay for the kit and run the event but was told he wasn't interested. This is a shop I've frequented for over 25 years.

Getting people to visit the store who might not otherwise?
