The contents of Khazad-dum claims that there are 14 Quest cards in the expansion.  But I've only got 13.

Is the rules insert wrong or am I missing a card?  Anyone else got this problem?

I just checked my set and I only have 13 quests cards.....For the Balrog quest I have 7 2B cards is that what every one else got?

 Same here, numbered 64 to 76.  I have card 63 as well, so if there's one missing it would be card 77.

 don't worry guys :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I have the same setup. BUT there are 117 encounter cards when I counted last... just add the numbers of the new enumeration under the icon - should be 117 - somebody counted wrong - the wrote 116 encounter cards and 14 quest, but there are 13 quest and 117 encounter cards... 

maybe one of the marketing guys screwed up and counted a torch or book of mazarbul as a "quest" card...

 

btw: OMG THIS IS THE BEST COMPONENT OF THE GAME SO FAR!!!! AWESOME QUESTS, COHERENT ATMOSPHERE and COOL PLAYER CARDS::: WWWWWWOW!
