Do I have to discard a condition attachment, or is it optional? Say I wish to play the "Miner of the iron hills", but the only condition attachment I have is "unexpected courage" which I obviously don't want to lose.

It is a Response and as stated in pag. 23 of the rulebook (came with the Coreset) it is optional:

 

"Responses
Responses are denoted by a bold “Response:” trigger on a card. Responses are always optional, and can be triggered by their controller in response to (i.e. immediately after) a specified game occurrence. (...)"
 
 
PS: Bold is mine
