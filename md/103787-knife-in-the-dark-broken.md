With the new release of the Voice of Isengard I find that this quest from the Dark Riders Expansions suffers a lot. Why? Well Bill Ferny isn't that annoying anymore. The Westfold Outrider makes it quite easy to take him out from staging after which killing him is no problem at all. Since he isn't that kind of a striking enemy. 

Previous to the VoI you always had a challenge of getting him out quickly. His 5 hp are great since 1 Gandalf isnt enough to kill him. And you always need some combinations of cards to get him out.

I really hope that I'm not the only one who thinks this quest lost the true challenge that lay within it.

Let me clarify it a little.

 

The real challenge to me was always to get Bill out soon and be able to adapt to the mega-Nazgul fight at the end. (While you have enoguh willpower) Now you only need to focus on the Nazgul fight since Bill is gone before you even notice. No exra preparations  are needed anymore.

Just don't play Westfold Outrider if it bugs you. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

You could do this with the Core Set and Son or Arnor as well.

there will always be quests that can be easily defeated if your deck is tailored to beat them.  obviously son of arnor and westfold outrider are good options, but also hail of stones, hands upon the bow, and forth eorlingas are also previously existing options to take him down.

Son of Arnor costs only 1 more resource, he is leadership (most resource-rich sphere), he does not dies to bring Bill Ferny. And yeah, he is from the core set. So, if I'm going to judge quest like you, I'll say that this quest never had a challenge at all.

The Hammer-stroke already did this, too. Just one more way you could draw out Bill Ferny and wreck him.

Let's just hope Bill Ferry isn't reading this... :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

Guys! Guys! I just found another way to break this poor scenario! Take Elrond, Beorn and any other 12 threat hero with 3 attack. Don't send ANYONE on the quest, and welcome Bill with open arms on turn 1, slaugthering him with Beorn and the second 3-attack hero.
