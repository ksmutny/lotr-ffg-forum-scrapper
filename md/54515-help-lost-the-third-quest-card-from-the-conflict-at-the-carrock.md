I bought the Conflict at the Carrock expansion pack a couple of weeks ago and lost the third quest card. Can anyone tell me what it says so I can finish that quest? It hasn’t mattered much since I have been playing with one deck and keep getting murdered by the first two quests but I would like to theoretically have a chance to win.

There are only 2 quest cards in Conflict at the Carrock, not 3.

edit: **** you, Svenn!  beat me to it.

Thank You, Most of the other quest sets spell out the victory conditions on the last card. But the second quest card didn’t. I am having a great time playing this game. I am considering quitting my job so I can play it more.

So am Igran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] Since I bought the game I have stopped doing anything else but played it. I am even thinking of bringing it to work, but being a teacher I think it would be difficult to play secretly. The only thing that still keeps me at work is earning enough to buy all the oncoming expansions and APsgui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] 

My wife only tolerates my new addiction because she hasn't found a name for it yet to give it to my doctor.

The third quest card says, "return to Quest 1A"...I dunno, I still haven't beat that darn quest!

Untill FFG learns from it's mistakes... right.... Hahahahahah! partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif]

Seriously... I find it highly Ironic that a quest such as this generates so many "Trolls".
