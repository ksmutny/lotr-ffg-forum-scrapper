Hi, if I use Gandalf with Sneak Attack is the response activated? In other words can I reduce my threat etc. Thanks.

Yes, he 'enters play', so you can pick one of his responses.

You have discovered the number one C-C-C-Combo in the game. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Gandalf is the ultimate utility card, deck lacks card draw...gandalf, deck needs more threat reduction...gandalf, deck needs direct damage.......

Gandalf and Sneak attack is awesome, saved our skin few times, ecpecially during Anduin campaign by nuking few enemies or helping with trolls. Too bad you can't use the sneak attack and Beorn's +5 attack buff, since Beorn is shuffled back at the end of the phase and not the round :-/

BUT! You can use Sneak Attack to put him into play when you normally can't, such as when you have no Tactics Heroes or as an emergency defender.

Yes you can; it's even the quoted example in one of the first FAQ entries:

 

 

> (1.02) Simultaneous Effect Timing 
> 
> If two or more conflicting effects would occur simultaneously, the first player decides the order in which the effects resolve.
> 
> Example: Tom plays Sneak Attack (CORE 23) to put Beorn (CORE 31) into play during the combat phase. Sneak Effect has the condition, “At the end of the phase, if that ally is still in play, return it to your hand.” During combat, Tom uses Beorn’s triggered effect, which has the condition, “At the end of the phase in which you trigger this effect, shuffle Beorn back into your deck.” At the end of the phase, a situation arises in which two conflicting effects are attempting to resolve simultaneously on Beorn. The first player determines which of the two effects resolves first. (The second effect no longer applies when Beorn leaves play.)
> 
>  

 

So you choose to resolve the "Beorn goes into your hand at end of phase" effect from Sneak Attack first, and then the other effect (that would have shuffled him into your discard pile) no longer applies.

 

If you haven't seen the FAQ, you definitely need to download it and read it.

I read FAQ quite a few times and completely missed it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I feel dumb now, so... Thanks rmunn! For the clarification, of course!
