Action: Raise your threat by 1 to ready Boromir.
Action: Discard Boromir to deal 2 damage to each enemy engaged with a single player. 

Action is manadatory to be executed or the player can choose to pass? And if players wants to do an action, can select one of the 2 in the order he decides ?

Actions are always optional.

Boromir (Tactics) has two actions. You may choose to activate one of them, both of them, or neither of them, as long as there is a window to take actions available.

This applies to all Actions on all the cards? What about events? Those must be only played in planning phase?

Events can be played either at any time (if they are a response trigger that has it's conditions fulfilled), or any time there is an action window (if they have an action trigger), or sometimes during any action window in a given phase (for example, events that say Combat Action can be played during any action window in the combat phase).

A small number of events can only be played at a certain time during a certain phase, but those are very explicit in their description.

If you have to do it, it days “forced”

I think the first action for Boromir was errated... with a Once per year limit or something... but I'm not sure... I donn't remember seeing any mention of it around here...

Yes, limit once per phase. I’m guessing that was a joke. Though seriously, errata should be errata’d to once per year.
