If Snowstorm is attached and reveiled for the shadow effect and I don't defend the attack but assign the damage to legolas with one willpower, is he considerd the defender then and do I discard him? Or can I ignore the shadow effect in this case?

If you declare no defender, shadow effects affecting the defending character have no effect.

That's what I thought, then I played the card correctly. Thanks.
