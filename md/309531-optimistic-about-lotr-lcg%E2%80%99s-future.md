# [Optimistic about LOTR LCG’s Future](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309531-optimistic-about-lotr-lcg%E2%80%99s-future/)

## 1 [General_Grievous on July 2, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309531-optimistic-about-lotr-lcg%E2%80%99s-future/?do=findComment&comment=3958087)

Anyone else notice that the last 4 announcements on the main page are LOTR related? One for our beloved game, one for JIME, another for the anniversary edition of LOTR The Board Game and the livestream with JIME as it’s cover. 
 

After the long hiatus it’s nice to get a ton of love from FFG. Especially leading up to unto their annual livestream and future products announcement. And with all of the above it seems to me at least like LOTR isn’t as dead as many think it is after this cycle. They obviously recognize that it’s a popular property and are still pushing even the older LOTR games. 
 

Also there was the interview with the head of Asmodee who stated (More or less) that the market was flooded with games and that a focus will be on expanding existing games with established lines. This definitely describes the LCG. 
 

So regardless of what things look like post-break, I’m optimistic that we are going to get more content, and here is hoping for some more campaign material and contracts! 
 

Anyone else pick up on this and have any hopes or thoughts?

I really want to believe that, but a lot has been indicating otherwise, and the LOTR-related announcements at the same time is probably just a coincidence. Fingers crossed, though - but from what i have heard, playtesters have not received new material to test for a while. If we get something new, it's gonna be a loooong time from now, and this break could not be the best for the playerbase.

I think Zura is right, it really feels like the game has run its course. Its my favorite game, and there is plenty of content, enough to last a lifetime, so Im actually ok with it ending here. Personally I think FFG hasn't given a 'ton of love' to the game in a loooong time. 

Granted covid happened, but it was 4 long months between them even announcing pack 5 and 6.

I'm at peace with the game ending but I think ffg should complete the release of nightmare saga deck. 

 

It's not fair to the players base not to compete that. Then if they stop new POD or decide not to release nightmare versions of latest cycle, ok that would be acceptable, but saga nightmare deck should be completed.

That we lost our main designer to Champions is not good news for our games, since AFAICT Champions is selling well.  Champions may be the reason that Rhun and Mordor were combined into a single cycle.

With that said, FFG obviously is still using their LOTR license, and while they have the license there's always hope for future content.  Further, if the popularity of Champions is attributed partially to its distribution style, LOTR may be seen as having potential uncaptured upside if revived with a new release format.  Champions is also creating new LCG players that might be interested in something a little tougher and more complex.  And there's still the new LOTR-based series to come out, which may stimulate interest in Tolkien as the movies did.

So I think it's possible that more content may be generated, and as long as FFG thinks it is possible, I would expect reprints to be maintained.  While there's life there's hope, and need of vittles.

Keep purchasing packs, bringing in new players, and let them feel the demand, and perhaps we can hope that it will return some day! 

 

(And there will be a neutral hero version of Aragorn to make it all up to us!)

The Lotr Lcg is old, so the pace may get slower, but the Lotr Lcg is still among the most popular lcgs! When I present in convention Ffg Lcg games, the Lotr of the rings still is the most popular, the second is AH and the rest becomes far behind! So Yes, Lotr is doing just fine!

lotr is something where parents will come with their children, Also fantasy fans will stop by it. AH is for gamers and ropleplayers. Competitive Lcg... well Are interest by competitive players and not too Many of those around. SW was reasonable popular and people did like the deckbuilding mechanic, it was less complex to card game noobies than most. New Marvel Lcg will most likely be big hit when convetions starts again, but I Expect that Lotr still gets reasonable audience among new players.

Inclined to agree that this game has run its course (where on Middle-Earth has not been visited?). Great to hear that the digital version of the game has been saved though. ☺️

Here's some places on Middle Earth not yet visited:

Far Harad

Rhun

Khand

Forochel

IIRC, there was a report that Caleb intended to have the current cycle head East into Rhun and have the following cycle head into Mordor, but those were combined to get him off LOTR and onto Champions sooner.

We've also not been to western Gondor (Pinneth Gelin, Andrast (not on land at least), Druwaith Iaur), nor to Minhiriath, the Shire, and around the river Lhûn. Those areas are pretty empty on the maps, but then again, so was the map for Vengeance of Mordor. So there could be a cycle in those areas perhaps.

We already know LOTR LCG is ending with the current cycle.  If the number of forum posts about a game are any indicator, LOTR LCG is certainly the most popular of FFG's LCG's.  Moving Caleb to Marvel Champions was important for FFG to make that game successful.  I'm hoping it will come back in the future in some compatible format, but  with the myriad of layoffs and staff reduction at Asmodee, it's no surprise they are shifting people around to setup different lines.  While Caleb is certainly a huge LOTR fan, you can tell Marvel is where is heart is.  I'm sure he jumped at the chance to develop that game.  Looking to the immediate future, picking up Journeys is probably the way to go for the mean time.  Fortunately, LOTR LCG is ending by FFG's own accord and not due to a loss of license or other form of mismanagement that abruptly ends so many games these days.  Once MC is of the ground, in a year or two we may see LOTR return.

It may be false hope, but I greatly prefer saying the game is going on "hiatus" rather than is ending.

I know for my part I have been a doomsayer since last year when I decided to complete my collection as fast as I could. I still stand in that camp, but I will be the first to say I would be thrilled to be wrong. Here's hoping!

I rushed to acquire all the Nightmare decks this summer. I held off for a long time, being uncertain as to whether I would enjoy them... but then panic set in as I saw many of them go out of stock in stores across Canada, and even on Asmodee's own website. I suspected that those would be low priority for reprints at this stage in the game's life cycle, so I got them all while I could, just in case. I even ended up ordering one from the UK... which makes for one **** of an expensive Nightmare pack (it hasn't arrived yet, so we'll see what kind of duty gets slapped on), but oh well.

I've since played through the first 9 Nightmare quests, and no regrets so far!

I've also been pleasantly surprised by The Wizard's Quest, which I did not think I would enjoy (I have no interest in playing this game competitively), so have ordered all of the custom scenario kits, as well. So long as FFG keeps the core set in print, I think releasing Custom Scenario kits for post-Khazad Dum cycles would be a good idea, if only by allowing new player a taste of each cycle for a fraction of the cost, and without having to endure the frustration of hunting down expensive/out of print packs from the original cycles.

In theory, the scenario packs would be a really easy way to continue going forward, but the problem is I don't think there are any places explored in the game as well as Mirkwood and Moria were.

Ha Ha! I’m your limey twin mirror. I did the same here in Britain and have one heck of an expensive The Road Darkens Nightmare pack from America. Happy to report I’m the proud owner of everything printed thus far. I would be happy for the game to continue even if it needs to be in a reduced release schedule. Scouring of the Shire is a must have and I will never consider the game as complete until then!

I dont think there are any really promising areas to explore left. Also, there are no more factions to create really. Elves, Dwarves, and men have all become established archetypes. If the game comes back I highly doubt it will be in the form we had it (cycles, deluxes, adventure packs). 

## 23 [dalestephenson on July 18, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309531-optimistic-about-lotr-lcg%E2%80%99s-future/?do=findComment&comment=3962786)

The word before the hiatus was already that it would be a different form when it came back.  If it comes back I expect it to be more free-standing, perhaps like champions with player cards and quests being completely separate.  I would love to see something like this:

1) Campaign boxes -- something that contains 3-5 quests and no player cards, with some sort of optional campaign mode connecting the quests.

2) Player decks -- a completely playable, solo-capable deck, with supplemental cards not in the deck to fill out new cards to 3x and provide support for spheres not included.  May have some repeat cards and alternate-art heroes, but has at least one brand-new hero.

3) Saga expansions telling a story outside the timeframe of the narrow window used for the game.  There are *lots* of stories in the appendices that could make compelling expansions, allowing new historical hero/allies from the periods depicted.  Thorongil's raid on Umbar.  The Dwarf-Goblin War.  The Fall of Arnor.  The original War of the Ring.  Helm Hammerhand.  Kin-strife.  Elladan and Elrohir rescuing their mother from the Goblins.  The Ents searching for the Entwives.  Heck, both the main text and the expansion give us stories from the Silmarillion, which could be a veritable treasure trove.

It's true that the major racial groups associated with the Free Peoples all have their archtypes: Eagles, Silvan, Noldor, Dwarf, Rohan, Gondor, Outlands, Dunedain, Dale, Woodmen.  We also have Harad, which reminds us that free people oppose Sauron outside the narrow realms of the west, as Aragorn knew from his trips south eand East.  We see non-evil men along the Running River in the current cycle, but they get no archtype and we never get east of Rhun.  Woodmen are thin on the ground and not fully developed.  I think it's likely that more than Dale and Woodmen exist of the free Northern relatives of Rohirrim.  We haven't even met the Snow People yet.

Also, there's no reason for racial archtypes to be singular -- for Dwarves we have swarm and mining, separated not by race but by mechanic.  We may have traits well represented, but we certainly have not reached the maximum number of possible racial archtypes, let alone the many non-racial archtypes that can be created by even a single hero.

There is much that could be done.  Whether it will be done is unfortunately going to be a business decision, not a labor of love.

Great points Dale, we also still need to go and spend time in the north west and the shire, but that isn’t to say we can’t go revisit a place. Same thing with player card locations, and player cards that you can put in the staging area like Huorns.

The problem is you can say that we haven't been here yet or explored this archetpye to its fullest yet, but at what point will the community be satisfied? It seems to me like they will never really will be. No sooner is the latest cycle 'spoiled' than people are talking about things they don't have, rather than the things we did get.

Let me rephrase the question "at what point will the community be satisfied?"

At what point will people who enjoy a "Living Card Game" that continually expands its possibilities wish that game to die and never expand again?

Never.  So what?  Yes, it's true that the possibilites already exceed what can be done in a lifetime, but I can think of *nothing* I enjoy where I hope there will never anything new to enjoy and explore, just because I enjoy the things I already have so much.  I know that day will come, "East or West all woods must fail".  But I see *absolutely* no reason I should anticipate it with gladness!

Right, its ok to dream and hope, so long as that hope doesn't become complaining or an ungrateful attitude. I think theres a line between wanting more in a good manner and just being bitter or complaining. 

Not accusing you guys of that though, just stating that there is a right and a wrong attitude in regards to this subject. 

I totally understand being able to dream of course, I like to do so myself at times.

Yea, I think it's safe to say we all suffer from Dragon-Sickness.  Can never have too many LotR: LCG cards in one's hoard.

I can imagine at least some of the LotR:LCG players also played MECCG in the mid to late 90s. Very funny reference. But also funny that you reference a MECCG card to describe Dragon-sickness of LotR:LCG when the LCG model doesn’t really promote hoarding like the CCG model does. I have the complete player card set (thus far) of LotR:LCG including 3 of all player cards in the Core set (I don’t have a few standalone scenarios and don’t have any nightmare sets) and I might still be hanging onto more MECCG cards (mostly commons and what not) than LotR:LCG cards. Just saying. 😀

Sorry for the squirrel of my first comment. I am fine with finishing with the content (areas explored) that we have, but I am “not fine” with the player card collection that we have. At least from a solo perspective it would be nice to be able to play all 13 dwarves, Bilbo, and Gandalf in a solo deck. Maybe introduce a hero named Dernhelm that is the same threat as Eowyn, so you could really thematically play Helm of Secrecy. Stuff like that. So if creating content and quests is too difficult and time consuming, maybe offer player cards packs. And of course, no one likes watching something stop.

Yea, and really FFG could just continue to release player cards indefinitely and that would be fine.  There are, what.... 116 quests already available?  With four Custom Scenario-Building sets on top of that?  New quests are great and all, but new player cards are where the real excitement always is. I can build a Gwaihir deck right away and start having fun with it, but's going to be probably years before I get to the Vengeance of Mordor cycle... I've been playing this game a lot over the past year (and it's been my go-to Pandemic game) and I'm still only at Druadan Forest in the HoN Cycle.

I couldn't agree with you more. I started December of 2017 and have played about once a week since then and still have 2.5 cycles to go. I wouldn't mind some simple booster pack setups, maybe 12 cards (3xeach sphere) without a hero.

I totally disagree.

I can count on one hand the cards that are really missing in the card pool right now to feel "complete" for me. I could see how a cycle worth (or two) of player cards could fill the gap in a few archetypes. I would welcome player cards, for sure.

But no.

You could tackle the 116 quests with one deck if you want. You wouldn't play 1 quest with 116 decks though. You would get soooo bored.

To play this game, you need quests way more than you need player cards.

Most of the discussion is about player cards, because it's still a deckbuilding game. But about excitement? I've seen more threads over the years of "where do you think the next cycle will be?" rather than "what archetype do you think they will bring?" (barring people wanting some specific character or item). Some people accept player cards spoilers but not encounter spoilers. The contrary is rarer IMO.

So nope. At this point, with contracts, MotK, Thorongil and Helm of Secrecy, the player deckbuilding options are infinite. The quest pool is only 116 quests. The game's variety is all about quests.

More quests is what we need.

Quests.

Quests.

Quests.

There are two things that come to mind for me which FFG hasn't done with this game yet but which could really spice things up and give new life to old cards.

 1. Create a saga-like mechanic tying together all 9 quests for each expansion, with boons, burdens, treasures, and so on to add an RPG-like element to the game. This has been discussed many times in the past, and would have a lot of player appeal. It's also highly modular, allowing players to dip in however much or for whichever cycle they want. This would also be an opportunity to "fix" older quests (like many in the Shadows of Mirkwood and Khazad-dum expansions), as some of the Nightmare scenarios have done. This would be easily doable with a standalone expansion pack for each cycle.
 2. Standalone or in combination with #1, it would be very interesting if FFG created unique challenges that combined novel quests with interesting deck-building or even gameplay restrictions or rules changes. There are many, many examples of custom fan-made challenges, and it would be cool if FFG were to bring all if its design and develop resources to bear on this idea. A while back they issued a Designer's Challenge, "Three is Company [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/11/9/three-is-company/]", which could be a model. That challenge received pretty favorable reviews, if I recall correctly, but FFG never did another one.

I've seen more threads over the years of "where do you think the next cycle will be?" rather than "what archetype do you think they will bring?" (barring people wanting some specific character or item). Some people accept player cards spoilers but not encounter spoilers. The contrary is rarer IMO.

Totally untrue, imo. 

The majority of players i know have not yet played all of the quests, while trying out most, if not all of the major archetypes. Quests, in general have better replayability than a player deck. They're less player dependant and as such, there's more variance. 
Majority of the game happens in the player deck, no matter how you look at it. It's how you play the game. While there's some tailoring against the scenario, players make decks to achieve some results using different playstyles. It defines the experience much more than the scenario. 

I would also risk saying the whole "infinite" deckbuilding thing is a bit of overstatement, imo. When you stop looking at the combinations of cards and start looking at actual deck foundations avaiable, the amount shrinks to around 40-50 (just spitballing numbers, but i bet it's around here) viable strategies, like "a cotw deck with repeating events, a secrecy with ally swarming with very good tale/timely aid, a boromir fire/blood, fellowship rush, trait deck swarms, etc, etc". While you can make a gondor swarm in variety of ways, it does not create a distuinguishable enough experience for the player to feel like there's a lot of variety going on. 

I ran through your thought experiment and i believe it would be much more enjoyable to run 116 different player decks against a single solid quest than vice versa. Your own strategy you're executing can burn you out, the uncontrollable encounter less so, as you're still getting your puzzle.

If you think about it, the player cardpool is actually still not that big and same staples are the foundation of most solid decks. This is not a criticism as the game couldn't take ToW's or steward's ban because it was designed around their existence, but after almost 10 years the core set staples have no real competition.

It's almost impossible to bore yourself with 116 quests, while the cardpool does feel claustrophobic to me at times. As you feel like you "mastered" the "big" archetypes you're really just push to crappy gimmick decks. And i love them of course, but tbh i feel we still need more player cards, even at the expense of the 116th and 117th quest, as 1 single staple player card can reinvigorate the pool (contracts) the way a quest cannot provide.

Why not both? More quests and more player cards hahaha

This has been discussed many times in the past, and would have a lot of player appeal. It's also highly modular, allowing players to dip in however much or for whichever cycle they want. This would also be an opportunity to "fix" older quests (like many in the Shadows of Mirkwood and Khazad-dum expansions), as some of the Nightmare scenarios have done. This would be easily doable with a standalone expansion pack for each cycle.


It's really surprising to me that this hasn't been done.  Everyone I've talked to seems to love the Campaign-aspects of the Sagas and really wants something that makes the "stakes" of a non-Saga games a little more interesting.  So much could be accomplished with even just a 50 card pack (this would give you one Campaign Reference Card and 4-5 Boons/Burdens for each of the 9 Quests in a cycle).  This wouldn't really take much more work, from FFG's perspective, than the Custom Build-a-Scenario packs they've been releasing over the past year.

I guess I'm the exact opposite, in this regard.  I would get exceptionally bored playing the same deck for 116 quests.  I was trying to do a "The One Deck" Gray Wanderer deck, and I almost disliked my deck after running through just the first 22 Quests (through Heirs of Numenor) and had to put it down.  That's not even 20% of the quests in the game.  I'll certainly return to it at some point, but I really needed a change of pace with some radically different decks.  On the other hand, I'm sure I've played some quests more than two dozen times, as I've got a lot of different decks and play not only solo but with two other groups of players.  I'm sure I've played Journey Along the Anduin (my go-to first test quest for a new deck) at least 100 times, and I am positive that I'd have much more fun playing Journey Along the Anduin for the 100th time with a new deck than I'd have playing the 100th new quest with the same single deck.

All of the groups I play with tend to grab our decks and then try to run them through a cycle, or at least a series of linear quests.  I honestly don't know how other players/groups would decide what to play... like do so some people build a deck and think "man I really like Encounter at Amon Din and The Redhorn Gate, so I'm gonna take this deck against those two quests..."  I suppose the difference may be in how people approach deckbuilding.  I tend to be more in the "The One Deck" kind of camp, and build decks that are intended to take on host of quests, while other people view deckbuilding as something you do with a particular quest in mind.  For people who build decks AGAINST each individual quest, since with that approach you're basically looking at each quest as a challenge to unravel and beat, once that's done... maybe it doesn't have much replayability because you've already built and proven what you think is the best tech against that quest..?  For me, I view deck-building as an exercise in trying to build decks (especially thematic ones) that are robust and flexible enough to tackle an entire cycle worth of quests... so for me I find myself happily replaying the same cycle of quests over and over because the novelty is seeing how a new deck responds (or fails to handle) to the challenges of those quests, and a series of quests are the metric by which a deck is evaluated.    

There are still lots of archetypes I have never even tried, and lots and lots of unexplored variations of archetypes I have tried, so I don't think lack of variety in Player Cards is pressing issue.  But if we were to be graced with new content, and I had to pick either new player cards OR new quests, hands-down I know I'd get the most excitement and mileage from new player cards, because I'm sure I could play the existing 116 Quests for an eternity and not get bored with the game.  And having a 117 or 118 or 222 available quests wouldn't really change that much.  Having another twenty heroes or six new contracts or thirty new attachments... that however would certainly be felt and appreciated.

Honestly, more contracts are probably the single most efficient means to mix up the game. This could be a vehicle for accomplishing my second point above, especially if the contracts started messing with not just deck-building and player rules, but also the encounter deck rules. Imagine a contract that gave a big player boost, but also let the encounter deck reveal an additional card per round. Or a contract that allowed players to have two active locations at a time, or one which introduced a variable "traitor" element into the game which could strike you at any point unawares. Myriad possibilities are possible through the existing rules-modification framework provided by contracts.

Exactly -- imagine if there were a way to create a similar dynamic for any hero, for any quest... Could be very cool.

I've long been saying how insane it would be for them to not at least bring it back when the Amazon series airs, we've seen with the Witcher the amount of profit that can be generated by a mainstream series drawing attention to a property. 

To a somewhat lesser extent, Journeys in Middle Earth also seems to be a focus of theirs, drawing attention to not only LOTR properties of theirs, but even their invented characters.

I just don't see how or why they'd stop the LCG forever under such circumstances.
