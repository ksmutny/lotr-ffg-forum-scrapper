From Quest 2B of the first Hobbit Saga.

Can a sacked hero gain a resource? and can he also play a card?

Thanks!

"Attached character cannot ready, attack, defend, commit to quests, or trigger effects. "

It doesn't say anything about not gaining resources, so sacked heroes do gain resources, and similarly those resources can still be spent to play cards.
