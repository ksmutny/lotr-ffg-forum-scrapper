Dear Gurus,

When playing a card that says something like Gandalf's "…deal 4 damage to 1 enemy in play…" Can that damage be defended with defense strength or does damage come straight off the Hit Points as does an undefended attack? Thank you!

hi

deal damage bypasses defense and goes straight to hit points

Thanks! That's what I thought I read but we just went through rule book and FAQ and couldn't find ruling. We just revealed three Undisturbed Bones in a row (Each player must deal X damage to 1 ally he controls. X is the number of allies he controls)! It left us bruised and bleeding; good bye Eagles of Misty Mountains :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] Thanks again for the clarification!
