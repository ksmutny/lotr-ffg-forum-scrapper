(1.01) Encounter Keywords

Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur is revealed from the encounter deck, including during setup. 

 

My question is : if the card is add to the staging area or put into play Doomed, Gurded and Surge is still trigger or don't? Sounds like don't right!?

I read it as they Dont't trigger.

How come they do not resolve? It says so in the cuoted text. What did I miss?

They make a distinction between "revealing" a card and "adding" a card.  If a card is revealed, doomed/surge etc are triggered.  If it is not revealed, but "added" to the staging area, they are not triggered.

Interesting.

## 7 [mr.thomasschmidt on August 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88089-about-keywords/?do=findComment&comment=834943)

So if a quest setup demands some cards to be added to the staging area before starting the game you don't resolve any possible keywords on them? Sounds strange but I have to guess then that not a single quest uses just the word "add" but rather both like "reveal ... and then add to staging ect." Correct?

Man, this game would be less complicated if they didn't focused so much on the words as on just the rules. But also less funny I guess :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

faq deals with this

(1.01) Encounter Keywords
Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be
resolved any time the card on which they occur is
revealed from the encounter deck, including during
setup.

 

its appears that set up is an exception

Okay. I think I'll just play it like they always resolve and treat "add" as "reveal :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] less cunfusing I think.

But thanks for clearifying Rich :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Only if card are revealed during the setup.

But that goes for all cards during all quests to my notice. Please correct me if I'm wrong but as I remember every time in setup that you have to take cards from the encounter deck and ad them to the staging area it says "reveal x cards and ad them ..."

Nope. AoO, for example, says "each player chooses one enemy and one unique location etc". Ok, none of the eligible cards has a keyword, but it's likely that other quest cards have a similar wording.

My interpretation is that none of the cards are  "revealed" during setup but the keywords are resolved nonetheless.

That is some of my point. Those where there's keywords would almost have to occur every time. Anyone knows of a quest where you are asked to draw a card and just ad it, no reveal it? A quest where you have the risk drawing/finding a card that actually has a keyword on it I mean :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

ah, i think you are correct there leptokurt

@thomasschmidt

Well, take the spiders of mirkwood in the core set. "On a chosen path" each player adds a spider to the stage and some of them have "when revealed" effects on them...
