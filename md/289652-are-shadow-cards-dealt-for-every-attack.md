Does every attack  get dealt a shadow card (unless specified otherwise)? Specifically, attacks that take place outside the normal framework.

 

Thanks in advance!

Indeed, unless otherwise specified each enemy's attack gets a shadow card, even those outside the combat phase, or additional attacks during the combat phase (even though usually you discard the previous shadow card in these cases) and so on.

Thanks for the answer! That confirms our suspicious.

Caveat -- if the encounter deck runs out of cards outside the quest phase, you do *not* reshuffle it to provide shadows.  Enemies go without.

If the encounter deck runs out during the quest phase, you reshuffle it immediately, not when another card is needed.
