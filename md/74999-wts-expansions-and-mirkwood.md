Have all the mirkwood cycle except for carrock and have KD and Hobbit expansion and of course core. Looking to sell for $100.00 basically new with card sleeves for bout 80% of cards. Characters/events/etc in binder pages w/ binder.  Encounter sleeved in cardboard container.  Had for bout 3 months but realize I play way more AGoT and will play A: NR.  Got this hoping my GF would play but she hated it so… let me know.  In OH in US. Thanks. Will cover shipping btw.

Would you break it down in different lots ?

And would you ship to Europe ?

She doesn't play card games though, so wouldn't that lower the cost overall?
