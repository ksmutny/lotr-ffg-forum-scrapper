This is not clear in my edition of the Rules: may a Hero equip an Attachement Card not belonging to his/her own sphere of Influence but which has been activated by a different Hero of the Attachement Card's same Influence….that is , may a Hero "borrow" an Attachement Card from a different Hero who has activativated that same Card by legally spending resources, as it were, in favour of the former Hero who could not activate that item because of un-corresponding Influence? Thus, for instance, a ""Spirit" Hero could equip an Armour card just being activated by a "Tactics" Hero who gives the item to the "Spirit" Hero who could not spend Resources over that item. I'm playing according to a "no borrowing" rule, otherwise any Hero could just as well directly spend his/her own Resources over any Attachements, I'm still a little doubtful, anyway…Thanks for any advice.

and as long as all other requirements are met

Hi, i´m new to the game, and have some doubt about equipments.

 

Well, on two players game, can a player equip an attachment on a hero of the other player?

 

And when engaged on an enemy, at a new engagement fase, can the other player engage on a monster already engaged by other player? or the monster keeps engaged on always the same player?

 

i think this is it =D

1. Yep!

 

2.  No. Once an enemy engages a player, it stays engaged with that player until it is defeated/removed from the game or until a card effect directs otherwise.
