So if I have Forest Snare on an engaged enemy- do they still get dealt a card during combat phase (enemy attacks) even if they can't attack?

and another quick question- when resolving the dealt cards to enemies (during resolve enemy attacks)- are you only using shadow effects on cards, so if cards do not have a shadow effect- do they just get ignored and discarded?

 Yes they get a shadow card but as resolving the shadow card is a step within the attack phase, because the enemy doesn't attack, the card is discarded without resolving, right?

 

Or has that changed?
