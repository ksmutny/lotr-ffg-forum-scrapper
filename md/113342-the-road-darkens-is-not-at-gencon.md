I just landed, but Ian confirmed this from Caleb himself. This means that only Trouble in Tharbad and the Barrow Downs GenCon deck are available here. Queue sad trombone sound...

Just to be fair, I'm more excited about the hero version of Haldir of Lórien than the hero version of Gandalf, but I really wanted a live playthrough of The Road Darkens with the full Grey Company.

Yup, I'm with you there. Surprised it's not there, but given the slow rate I get to LOTR at the moment, it's quite a relief!! Have only managed Dunland Trap about twice, and only just got Three Trials!

Wows. And that's when I thought that release rate couldn't be any slower...

They will most likely announce the next Cycle at the In-Flight report tomorrow. My guess is The Road Darkens is 2-4 weeks out, but I will ask Caleb when I see him

I know there was a big delay, but after that (which affected all of the LCGs) they've been churning out the packs really fast.

 

But good! Now I don't have to be too jealous of all the people who are at GenCon while I'm stuck at work!

Do you know why there was such a delay?

No clue. But this game and Netrunner had a big gap between releases. Both after a big box set. I remember someone saying similar things about either Star Wars or GOT, but I don't play either of those.

Dan, I thought the old forest would be the gencon scenario?

Barrow-downs was going to be the fellowship event right?

Or am I totally misinformed?

Also, it's a shame the road darkens will not be available there.

I was really looking forward to knowing the content of the box.

Anyway, go and have a blast guys!

There is a photo on the CardBoard of the Ring's Facebook page of "The Road Darkens" box in a display case at Gen Con next to an empty space with a sign saying "To be announced Friday afternoon. Inflight report Westin Capitol III @ 12pm."

I have just been trying to add even just a link to that post and the forums seem to be not letting me, perhaps because it is a https rather than http?

 

I'll try saving the picture to my PC and upload here since Cardboard don't seem to have it on a webpage outside of FB - edit GAH! Can anyone else add pics? The pic tool seems broken to me right now.

Speaking of that picture, could they at least post a better picture of the cards (boons and burdens) in the display in front ot he box?

 

Nevermind, Grey Company already did it.

They just posted some photos over on Facebook. New Boons "Phial of Galadriel" and "Andruil" attachments. The Phial looks powerful. Andruil suggests that we will be getting an Aragorn ally in the Road Darkens. I wonder what sphere he will be...

You are correct, I meant to say Old Forest. Bear + Travel + No Sleep = Confused Bear.

Wish you guys have great days at GenCon, I can just stay online to wait the deluxe expansion news on the other side of the earth.

Why do you think it "suggests" it? Aragorn is present in the core set.

Because the text on Andúril seems to read "Attach to a hero or Aragorn". All versions of Aragorn present in the core set and expansion packs so far have been heroes, which would suggest an ally version of Aragorn since otherwise the text "or Aragorn" would be unnecessary.

 

However, I disagree with this analysis: I think the text is "Attach to a (sphere symbol) hero or Aragorn". I can't tell what the sphere symbol is -- maybe Lore. But even if the symbol is Lore or Leadership, the "or Aragorn" text would still make sense, since both the Lore and Leadership versions of Aragorn should thematically be able to carry Andúril. So I don't think the Andúril card suggests an Aragorn ally, as awesome as that would be to see.

> (Rivendell Bow)

With no text in your post, it's hard for me to tell what point you're trying to make. If you're simply pointing out that we've seen this kind of "Attach to _______ or Aragorn" text before, and so there's no particular reason to suppose Andúril will be anything new, then I agree. If you're making some other point, you'll need to explain it to me, because I can't guess your meaning from an image-only post.

 

Edit: Wait, I think I can guess the point you're making. That if Andúril says "Attach to a hero or Aragorn", there's no reason why that would mean an ally Aragorn is coming. But Rivendell Bow doesn't prove that point at all: quite the reverse, in fact. The reason why "or Aragorn" was needed on Rivendell Bow is because he does not fit into the categories of "Noldor character" or "Silvan character", and so an exception needs to be carved out for him. But Aragorn does fit into the category of "hero", so the "or Aragorn" part of Andúril's "Attach to a hero or Aragorn" text (if that's what it says) would be completely unnecessary if there were no new ally versions of Aragorn coming. Because if there were nothing but the two hero Aragorn versions we have, then the card could just as easily read "Attach to a hero". So if the card's text is "Attach to a hero or Aragorn", then it does suggest an ally version.

 

However, as I said before, I think the Andúril text reads "Attach to a (sphere symbol) hero or Aragorn". If that's the case, then it doesn't suggest an ally version of Aragorn, because whatever that sphere symbol is, there's at least one Aragorn card that doesn't match it. Which means the extra "or Aragorn" text is needed anyway.

I can't tell if Anduril is one of the "Setup" boons that you get at the start of the game.  It probably isn't because that would be pretty strong.  But, if it is a setup boon and it doesn't have the [sphere] requirement, that would suggest there is an Aragorn objective ally because that would be the only way to have a non-hero Aragorn in play during setup.

Currently, the attachment condition of Andruil is concealed. It could be as with Rivendell Bow.

My guess is that, like Glamdring, it says "Attach to a Warrior hero or Aragorn." You can see a bit of the r before hero, and Aragorn doesn't have the Warrior trait. (This would allow any hero to have Anduril, if you give Valiant Warrior to that hero.)

 

I'd like to get an Aragorn ally, either in The Road Darkens or later, but an ally version of Aragorn wouldn't benefit from Anduril's response to attack a just-attacked enemy. It says "Declare attached hero..."

 

The second line of text says something like "Attached hero gets +1 W, +1 A, and +1 D." Based on the spacing, however, hero is too short and character seems a bit too long, so I don't know. Below is my attempt to reconstruct the text, but there are clearly some missing pieces.

 

Attach to a Warrior hero or Aragorn. Restricted.
 
Attached hero     gets +1 W, +1 A, and +1D.
or
Attached character gets +1 W, +1 A, and +1D.
 
 
Response: After an attack in which the attached
hero attacked     resolves, exhaust Anduril to target
the enemy           just attacked. Declare attached hero
as an attacker against that enemy (and resolve the
attack).
