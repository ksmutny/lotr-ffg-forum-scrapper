This is mainly to the people at FFG,

I just wanted to bring to your attention a couple mistakes I've seen in regards to crediting the wrong artist with a piece of artwork.

The first was on the River Ninglor (THFG 17) which you credit to David Lecossu. However, you then used the same piece of artwork on River Langflood (CatC 44) and credit Marco Caradonna with the art. I believe the correct artist is Caradonna.

The next mix-up is with the Witch-King. On the card you credit Igor Kieryluk as the artist when Aaron Miller is actually the artist (as per his website: www.aaronbmiller.com [http://www.aaronbmiller.com])

Just wanted to make sure the correct artists got their due credit.

Guess this is a card for Return to Mirkwood from the same artist (even though he says it has been painted for Hunt for Gollum)
