Another quick question about location cards...Is it possible to have more then one of the same in the staging area during the same turn??

Thnx in advance.

Not only is it possible and allowable, but usually a frequent occurrance.  Think of them as different parts of the same thing.  In games when many locations are in the staging areas, the Northern Tracker allies are a godsend.  Cheers!

yes it can be a major set back for topping up threat, obviously casuing you to have to travel to that location to stop its effects and make it 'explored'
