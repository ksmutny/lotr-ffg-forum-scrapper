Nooo, I went to update my 'Favorites - Top 5' thing on my profile badge and it deleted the Massing at Osgiliath one. I didn't even touch that one at all. It appears FFG removed Massing from Collections completely.

So basically, take this as a warning and don't update your Top 5 or possibly even your collection at all if you don't want to lose it.

 

Ashame really, as I was hoping for the possibility of someday being able to fill all five slots with LotR LCG badges. sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

Yeah. I sometimes forget to click on the other subforums, though I still will occasionally as I think they merit existence, but not that one.

Weird that they kept that but ditched it from 'Collections'.
