# [Favorite Solo Sphere?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/)

 I just today posted a short article on why Spirit's my favorite Sphere when it comes to the starter, you can find the article here [http://thehopelessgamer.blogspot.com/2011/05/lord-of-rings-lcg-blondes-have-more-fun.html]. What's your favorite faction, and why?

## 2 [Toqtamish on May 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=462487)

So far Leadership is my favorite. I really like their extra resources, Theodred and Aragorn and some of their allies like Faramir.

## 3 [servant of the secret fire on May 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=462491)

Abilities/combos/playstyle:Leadership by far.

Art:Spirit.Galadriel's art (the favor of the lady card) is more than awesome.

I leave Gandalf out of the contest cause my name says allgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

I've only ever been able to complete solo games with the Spirit sphere, making it my favourite for now. 

## 5 [jhaelen on May 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=462516)

My favorite is Lore. I think it has the best tools to deal with what I consider a troubling aspect of the game: Decreasing the luck factor.

Leadership is too strong for my taste. It doesn't appear to have any weaknesses like the other spheres. The resource boosting can get ridiculous _and_ it has the single best combo in the game (Sneak Attack / Gandalf).

Spirit's threat reduction and recursion is very nice but it almost feels like cheating to me to use it.

Tactics is too one-sided right now, making it the worst choice. Winning fights does not win the game and it has to rely on Legolas to make quest progress, leaving you at the mercy of the encounter deck.

## 6 [Kennon on May 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=462524)

Right now it's Leadership for sure. Their resource generation puts them heads above the rest.

## 7 [Fotonurth on May 2, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=462565)

 I picked the game up today, and have been playing solo all evening, when not working on my aGoT decks. Going to my buddy's after he get's done at the gym to try co op. I am yet to beat the first part of the first quest. That said.... I think I realllly like Leadership and I'm thinking of a Leadership/Tactics deck.

## 8 [InfernalZebra on May 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=462631)

Leadership is hands down the best sphere in the game so far, without contest. It's a powerhouse in solo at 30 cards, and I believe it's currently impossible to build a working 50-card deck without using Leadership.

Even so, Spirit is my favorite. I just kind of enjoy questing, and Spirit is a powerhouse at it. Now if only they had some more allies so they wouldn't suck and die during all the other parts of the turn, things might be good. Once an Adventure Pack or two hits the shelves, I suspect Spirit has a lot of potential. 

## 9 [InfernalZebra on May 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=462632)

Ack. Crazy double post. Disregard.

## 10 [Dam the Man on May 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=462729)

Just one game done but Leadership was kicking ass and taking names. Lore didn't do nearly as much, though supported the other deck nicely.

 

(yes, just posting to get the "new" tag off this thread)

## 11 [DrNate on May 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464767)

 I feel safest and most comfortable playing Leadership. Sometimes I still lose (grr...scenario 3) but I always feel that I have the best chance with Aragorn and Faramir by my side. 

 For characters, nothing beats Tactics. I love the friendship forged between Gimli and Legolas in the novels, and I'm always a big fan of Beorn. Plus the Tactics Attachments are fantastic. 

 I like Rohan. Spirit gives me two Rohan heroes, and they are fantastic. Eowyn remains my single favorite character, she blew me away in the novels. Plus I have nothing to fear from Hummerhorns thanks to the Spirit men of Rohan. 

 Lore is very tricky, I never quite know what to expect from it, but it is always a boon. 

 Also, lest I forget neutral cards, Gandalf will always be 3 per deck for me. And I eagerly await Radagast, my first and primary Wizard in the original Middle Earth Card game. 

So, I guess it's a tie?

## 12 [Sign Ahead on May 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464791)

After struggling through a couple of catastrophic early-turn Encounter & Shadow draws, I learned to love the Lore sphere.The durability and foreknowledge (through Denethor and Henamarth) really fit my approach to gaming. Now, if I can just get through quests and combat a little faster!

## 13 [Malekous on May 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464794)

I enjoy the tactics deck. Once you get the hang of it and the feel of how to play the cards the only thing that can stop it is locations that bog down the staging area, but that only slows down the deck. I've won the first two scenarios with tactics only a few times now. Haven't tried the last one yet though with tactics only.

## 14 [Ahzrab on May 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464840)

Kinda strange to me that they didn't realize during playtesting, that Leadership would be grossly overpowered and Tactics would have some serious trouble.

## 15 [Casamyr on May 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464843)

Leadership seems the easiest to play with Solo, but I really enjoy the Lore deck with it's sheer card drawing power and ability to control the field.

## 16 [Oshio on May 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464898)

I'd have to say Spirit. Though Leadership is certainly strong (so strong, I think, that it is currently pretty much required to be one of the spheres if you are making a strong dual sphere deck), Spirit is more fun to play. It's a subtle strength at first, but once you get a feel for the cards and how it can completely control the board you can theoretically tread water infinitely via recursion (Dwarven Tomb & Will of the West are just amazing cards) and threat reduction. And, when it comes down to it, Threat is the most important 'currency' in the game. Though Sneak/Gandalf is a powerful combo, I really think that Galadrim's Greeting/Dwarven Tomb/Will of the West is far stronger, and I'm fairly sure that at some point Dwarven Tomb is going to be altered so that it removes itself from the game once used.

So yeah, Spirit ftw.

## 17 [servant of the secret fire on May 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464963)

Yes i enjoy spirit cards more than any other sphere.Leadership is more powerfull now and as a Gandalf fan i enjoy sneak+Gandalf but generaly spirit is more interesting than any other sphere and i love the art on spirit cards.

I can't wait Radagast to comes live and make a deck with spirit sphere and Radagast with his beasts.Also i can't wait for Galadriel.She and Gandalf  will allways have 6 spots in my decksgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

## 18 [scottindeed on May 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464981)

So far my favourite to play has been Lore.  The healing along with event and shadow card peeks are really useful.  Plus you get a good spread of stas on the Heroes.  3 Defence on Denethor, 3 Attack on Glorfindal and 2 Attack on Berevor makes it pretty decent in combat.

Looking forward to giving old Bilbo a go with it soon.

I managed to make a deck that gets through Mirkwood [http://www.spontaneousderivation.com/2011/04/30/a-tournament-tacticsspirit-deck-that-passes-mirkwood/], using Spirit and Tactics but it can only win consistently with three keyword/card changes (Sentinel, Ranged, and Wandering Took), so it doesn't really count. Both spheres contain cards that are useful to the decks of your teammates, and far less to themselves. Which is quite thematic, but weakens them severely in solo play.

Spirit is my favorite sphere even in solo, even though solo is a disaster for it. I love Éowyn, she's quite the questing powerhouse, and Bereavor's ability to kill treachery cards has been a life saver more than once. And the being able to sneak through quests by massively lowering threat is neat. The Galadhrim's Greeting is one of the best event cards in the game.

## 20 [Sign Ahead on May 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=465004)

I'm getting good results with a Spirit/Lore combo too (Eowyn, Glorfindel and Denethor). Even without help from the rest of their deck, the trio has a nice combination of questing strength, defensive durability and attack damage. With their events and attachments they become rock-solid defenders and questing powerhouses. They're not as powerful on the attack, but foes rarely last more than a couple turns.

Right now it's really tricky to play a legal 2 sphere deck that does not involve Leadership, as you will have some serious resource problems. This is probably your biggest problem with this deck. I've got a Leadership/Knowledge deck that can beat the first scenario 90% of the time and a Leadership/Spirit deck that can beat the first 2 scenarios 90% of the time. I'm hoping that after a couple of packs this won't be the case, but a Tactics/Spirit deck is just going to be rough overall. I'm not a fan of improving a deck by changing the game rules, it seems extremely unintuitive, but hopefully you won't have to do that when the card pool grows a bit.

That being said I'm shocked to hear you say solo is a disaster for Spirit. As it's impossible to play a tournament legal solo sphere deck now, I assume you are talking about the 'base set' Spirit deck, which, due to it's small size, can completely tear apart the first two scenario's due to it's threat reduction.

I don't think people are playing tactics correctly. I've won nightmare mode a couple times now with a tactics/spirit deck...

## 23 [ClydeCloggie on May 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=465365)

Still, the problem with Tactics is that it can't do anything when three locations show up in a row. No enemy to kill means the Legolas / Blade of Gondolin way to progress doesn't work and with max. 5 Willpower available (excl. Gandalf), 6 Threat in the Staging Area means end of game.

## 24 [Oshio on May 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=465369)

Also, Nightmare mode is not even remotely hard. I'm 0-5 against the third scenario with a deck that handily owns the first two, but I beat it without breaking a sweat on nightmare mode.

## 25 [Malekous on May 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=465392)

I have beat the first and second scenario with tactics only. Yes, it depends on the staging area and locations. However, spirit wouldn't last long if the first 5 encounters were all enemies...

Anyway, people are counting tactics out of even dual spheres. Just saying, its not that bad.

Not necessarily. Tactics/Leadership wouldn't be half bad, despite the high starting threat.

And yes, Spirit could last long even if the first 5 encounters were all enemies. They have the best quester out there and the only threat reduction in the game, coupled with someone who can snipe enemies in the staging area.

I agree with the second part of what you said. I think tactics is getting a bad rap in general. I made a really fun and successful Spirit/Tactics deck that combines our shared love of Tactics with a great playability. I posted the decklist in its own thread if you're interested.

## 28 [Malekous on May 9, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=465468)

I'll take a look, but I'm assuming it probably looks a lot like the deck I previously mentioned I've played and won nightmare mode with having spirit/tactics. Thanks though.

 

Also, I think anything+leadership is probably not half bad :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Edit: Just took a look at yours. There are some similarities, but I run Gimli, Legolas and Eowyn.

## 29 [conykchameleon on May 9, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=465471)

Yeah, I ran that one for a while. It's definitely a good one. It's just tough with that one to get Trackers/Scouts out, but with Legolas' ability it doesn't matter as much.

I want a Tactics/Spirit deck, so I can run my three favorite heroes: Gimli, Legolas, and Eowyn (also three of my favorites from the novels). I tried to build it, but I never quite got it right. I was convinced that it wasn't possible at this time, but maybe there's something I'm missing or doing wrong...

Those are the Heros I run. Here's what I do.

 

I muligan if there are no allies. I get the citadel plate on Eowyn (later I get the horn and favor of the lady on her too) Legolas gets the gondorian sword and unexpected courage. Gimli gets a citadel plate and dwarven axe. I do my best to get allies out to be meat shields while letting gimli and legolas do the dirty work (if legolas gets unexpected courage on him be sure to make 2 attacks that give a kill per round). I do my best to stockpile resources on Eowyn for my "Uh Oh" button if a hero dies to bring them back as well as the shadow stoppers and when revealed stoppers and discard shuffler. I believe the below is 53

 

Horseback Archer X3

Veteran Axehand X3

Gondorian Spearman X3

Beorn X2

Horn of Gondor X2

Quick Strike X3

Blade Mastery X3

Blade of Gondolin X3

Thanks for sharing your deck. I have a few questions: 

No spirit allies? How do you survive without the extra willpower? And the Northern Tracker and the Lorien Guide?

No Dwarven Tomb? Or Stand and Fight?

Do you ever really have enough resources for Fortune or Fate?

Not a fan of Rain of Arrows or Swift Strike?

I'm new to this forum as I have just gotten the game this past Wednesday. I've only played solo so far so I could learn it well enough to teach my kids and others. I started with the Leadership Sphere and played several times but didn't have the best luck and didn't get through the first scenario. I made some mistakes along the way so that didn't help, but I did have one game where I got close to getting past the first scenario. Then I tried the Tactics Sphere a couple times and while they could kick the snot out of enemies, they didn't do so well questing and gaining resources. Finally I tried the Spirit Sphere and got smoked in one game, I got close the next and then finally just beat the first scenario. I know that's not much to brag about considering how well others have done, but it was a great sense of accomplishment and fun. I was able to get to the 3rd phase where I had to find a Spider and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn and got it out there and had a couple rounds to use Dunhere to put wounds on it while it was in the staging. Then I brought out Gandalf to lay 4 wounds on Ungo and then put 2 more on it in combat. I had to get rid of Gandalf at the end of the round, but I had enough resources to play Stand and Fight to bring Gandalf back in the next round and lay down some final wounds on Ungo to win the scenario with my Threat Meter at 33 and all Heroes and several Allies still in play.

I'll have to try Lore Sphere next and can't wait for some multi-player games. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Sometimes I wish I had kids just so I could teach them my many games. Lol.

Glad to hear you did manage a success early. I think the first one with each color is the most satisfying, because each sphere plays so differently. It just feels gratifying when you are able to switch gears and win with a completely different strategy.

## 36 [Hahma on May 14, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=468452)

Thanks for the response Mestrahd happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] Yeah, in the games I've played, I've certainly found the differences in the spheres (except Lore which I have yet to play). I agree that it's to use different strategies so that it can be a different experience.

I have 8 year-old twin daughters that I've had playing Heroscape for awhile now and have just gotten them into Dominion (as I have just gotten into that too). They love the LOTR movies and when I showed them the demo video they were really interested. I told them that I have to play it several times so I can learn it well enough to teach them. What I'll do, as I did with Dominion, is that I'll have them play and I'll just teach and coach them until they get a better grasp. Dominion was easy enough but since you discard your hand every turn, you don't need as much forethought on when to use certain cards. But I think they'll do alright. I also play Summoner Wars with my 15 year-old nephew (as well as Heroscape and Dominion) and just got Thunderstone Dragonspire to learn and play with him. I hope to teach my girls both of those games in the future as well. I'd love to get Game of Thrones the card game as I've read the book series and loved it, but no one else I know is into it, so I likely won't get that game.

 

 

## 37 [Hahma on May 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=468685)

I played my first 2 player game last night with my nephew. He had Leadership and I had Spirit. We got smoked. I played the card to lower his Threat by 6 but that cost me as I got engaged and attacked a lot and after losing a hero I couldn't get much resource. I should have used the resource instead to get an ally for me as Leadership can deal with enemy better. I also read the rules again more carefully and found that we messed up and I was counting threat of engaged enemy while questing, no wonder we couldn't make any progress.

While that wasn't solo play related, I did try Spirit sphere in a solo game this morning and played correctly when questing and I got through the first sphere. I had to find and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn at the end, but fortunately I had drawn Gandalf and then used Stand and Fight to get him back in play. That is huge for the Spirit sphere as they don't have good attacks to take down the heavy hitters.
