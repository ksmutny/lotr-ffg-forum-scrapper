As you might know Druadan forest player card spoilers are already up at http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=822512 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=822512] and it already made my head spin at rules.

Card in question is white tower watchman, and I have two diferent points on it:

A) Can you achieve "each hero belongs to same sphere" effect with songs, Aragorns heirloom colection or other card effects that give hero aditional sphere icon?

 

B) how does undefended attack redirection interacts with quests that say "undefended attacks hit Golum, or battlefield locations"? (return to mirkwood, Siege of Cairn andros)

i would say songs cannot give the effect- a hero with a tactics icon doesnt technically belong to the lore sphere, even with a song of wisdom- i think this is in line with the whole 'single sphere decks' that ffg are pushing in this cycle

i would also say that he doesnt overrule the quest effects such as gollum

just my thoughts- may be wrong ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I agree with rich.

 

However i have to say that the wording in this case is different than usual.

 

It says "belong to the same sphere" instead of the usual " with a printed"..

Would really like some clarity on this card, to be 100% sure.

I would think the tower watchmen would work with songs, since it does not have the "printed" sphere requirment like all the other cards.

I agree.  Other cards use the specific wording of "printed"

This one does not, so songs should work as well as something like Vilya on Elrond.

i think this may be of help

this was regarding good meal and songs but it applies here

Hi Richard,
That's a good question. Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.
Cheers,
Caleb

Thanks for finding this, it makes card really more playable.

Also bonus watchmen question: 

C) how does it interact with extra hero from saga expansions (both Hobbits and upcoming Black riders), does it count as hero you control for this card, and other cards from this pack that requires all heroes to have same printed icon?

I would say that for as long as you control the hero with the baggins sphere, you cannot play those cards.

or rather, you will not get his ability

I have another one.

There is a location in this adventure that reads more or less: "every Wose enemy gains Archery 1".

If one Wose enemy has already printed Archery 2 for instance, I guess that enemy has a total amount of Archery 3 because of the location effect. ¿Hasn't he?

correct,  my friends and i came across an archery 12 or archery 16 round, that was fun.
