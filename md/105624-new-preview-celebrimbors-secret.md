I just want to say - I was wrong. I am overwhelmed at how awesome hero Galadriel looks with Narya!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm sooo disapointed that Ents aren't Creatures too :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] :(

Radagast doesn't get any love, this is sad.

 

Other than that, I love how Galadriel works both game and lore-wise. Can't wait to build something with her!

The art for all these player cards is lovely. I'm super excited for these cards now. I was interested but now I'm frothing at the mouth. I wonder what kind of Ent synergy will pop up, or if it'll be a small trait?

What the what! Mind blowing, I thought for sure they'd save her for the last pack!

She's so freaking awesome and works well with Silvan elves!

And now we can see where the mystery elf art went, it's Orophin!

This is so awesome that I can't quite believe it's not the last pack in the cycle. Galadriel is super powerful, but has a nice in-built limitation (you have to draw Nenya to take advantage of her willpower for questing). Once you've got Unexpected Courage and Nenya going though, you could have Galadriel's 4 willpower for questing, an extra card per turn, and would never raise your threat (other than encounter card effects and Doomed). Add on top of that the bonus that allies don't exhaust to quest on first turn. ****.

Holy crap, Galadriel is amazing.

 

Being able to avoid the end of the round threat increase (and draw extra cards to boot) is going to be amazing for any sort of combo deck. And in solo play you may not have to ever worry about the threat cap, especially if you go mono-spirit.

 

And that's entirely ignoring her other ability, which gives every ally a free quest the round it comes into play. Going to be fun with Celeborn, that's for sure.

 

The only downside is... she doesn't synergize with the Ent!

> The only downside is... she doesn't synergize with the Ent!

That doesn't bother me. I don't think there's any mention of a linkage between her and the ents, so thematically it's fine that they don't synergize.

I really like how they did Galdriel. It's a bit annoying that she is so limited (especially without attachments) and has so little versatility, but with Nenya and Unexpected Courage on her, she offers a LOT, though still very narrowly-focused. Her ability also allows her to get to the important attachments more quickly.

Thematically, I think she is about as spot on as they come. She brings rest, wisdom, and encouragement to other adventurers rather than jumping into the fray herself.

Wait, so drawing a card and lowering your threat by 1 is nothing? Also, being able to get double use out of allies the round they come into play seems pretty good. Just think about that with Core Set Gandalf - ridiculous!

 

Spirit has not had consistent card drawing until now, so I think Galadriel is amazingly powerful. As Ian said, once you get Nenya and some readying (UC, Miruvor, etc.) she becomes a real powerhouse.  In multiplayer she is even better because she can target a Tactics player, who would ordinarily lack both card draw and threat reduction.  I just don't see how targeted card draw *and* threat reduction in the same ability counts as nothing, but I am interested to hear your take.

OK, here is my take:

Allowing allies to quest without exhausting first turn they enter is good, but not so many allies can do anything besides questing, especially Spirit allies. 

One of the main roles of the heroes is being a front line, and she can't quest, attack or defend, so if you don't draw anything for her in your opening hand - you're out of luck and two other heroes better be able to handle the questing and fighting to be done.

But that's how they balanced her for the game.  If she could quest with four from round 1 (and she can contribute from round 1 if you get Nenya in your opening hand) she would be totally broken.  As is, she's insanely powerful, and there's lots of combinations she will be good in.  For example, pair her with Spirit Glorfindel and Eowyn, start with a low threat and quest like crazy.  If your threat is below the engagement cost of enemies, Galadriel will make sure it stays that way, and she'll provide you with the extra card draw, she'll accelerate your deck.   You can keep questing along, building up your forces until you get Nenya. 

Also, she'd be thematically weird if she were involved in combat.  I can imagine Elrond reliving his glory days and going on an adventure, but not Galadriel.

All very good yes. Surprise this is not the last pack. Galadriel and Gandalf, yes, and Word of Command. You can Sneak Gandalf for quest and use Word of Command in the same phase, very, very good.

WHAAAAT! I'M SO STOKED FOR THIS PACK!!!!!!!!!!!!! It looks incredibly amazing!! Galadriel is my favorite and they have done such an amazing job with her! And this is only the 5th pack, how will the 6th ever beat all of this awesomeness!!? 

 

Did anyone else notice this is our first hero with no flavor text!?? And I thought when Galadriel finally came out her threat would be more but we still continue the trend of no spirit hero having more than 9 threat.

 

We're also getting ents in this pack!! How many amazing things can they cram into this Ring-maker cycle!? It is sad that they aren't Creatures thought... Radagast :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] 

 

And now Orophin to have all the 3 brothers who is our mystery accidentally revealed artwork from so long ago..  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I think this is the most excited I've ever been with a preview article!!! I love this game!!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I really like the direction they took with Galadriel.

I think that everyone immediately going oh she's amazing with Unexpected Courage, rather proves the point I was making about all cards that are designed having to keep it in mind though. Which makes me pretty **** sad.

 

The ent has much worse stats than I was expecting. I mean he has really good stats for cost 2 (although he does come into play exhausted as many people were expecting).

I was expecting all Ents to have more defence and hitpoints than 2 and 3. I guess a wandering ent may be the youngest and therefore weakest of them.


Did anyone read the text on secrect chamber? it sounds like a pretty interesting mechanic for that adventure. You lose the game if the Orc's search finds the secret chamber it seems.

Yeah, I just went back and read what we're actually going to get in the scenario itself (usually what I look forward to most in the APs, but...well...) and what little they tell us does look pretty interesting! We're finally roving around Ost-in-Edhil, which is something I've been hoping for since they announced Voice of Isengard, so I'm pretty excited for this! 

 

In other news, does anyone remember if we're still on track with the AP names for this cycle, per the list that was posted on bgg a few months back? I seem to remember Celebrimbor's Secret as being one, but can't remember what was postulated for the sixth pack. Because, y'know, I haven't had enough excitement from this preview...

> Can you imagine her in a dwarf deck with Dain? Or an outlands deck? Dang. 

No, I would never do such a travesty. I mean Celeborn and Galadriel, who would not have them together? The great thing about the design of the two is that you need not have them together like Elladan and Elrohir but it makes totally sense to. But who the third with the current pool? I think Haldir will easily fill the gap later if he is Lore but for now I might invest in a sort of travesty and go with Bifur since most of the Silvan are Lore and not cheap.

She is really cool with a Doom deck…….. And thematically  also….Galadriel is not  fighter and she not running around as well. she just there give a spirit strange to everyone (if she have a ring) and also  give advice (card draw) and shelter( reduce threat).

 

She can be really amazing in 4 players game and also cool with some doom mechanic. you can play Saruman for 2 threat and he will take away encounter card, quest, fight or defend. not bad not bad. 

 

Art is something! This is Galadriel! That how i image her! much much better then in the movie……….

Exactly, i mean Galadríel effectively negates the "raise your threat by 1" each turn, and then some.

We can also boost her will power….. Let say  Galadriel Eowyn Grima support deck.  Lot of cards draw, Threat reduce and Will power boost. Like Dunadain Signal and or Protector of Lorien or there is another spirit card from the core set +1 spirit attachment. 

 

They can easy quest round 25 every round and also give a card draw and threat reduce. sound very good in 3 or 4 players game. Same time she is not super powerful, you must to know how to use her! Good way! I like it!

So happy to get an Ent. I think we all probably imagined Ents as having tons of defense and hit points, but that wouldn't work without making them super expensive or giving them a big handicap (like only being able to ready every few turns or something like that). As it is, this Ent has the same stats as Haldir for half the cost. That's not bad, especially if you can get a few on the table at once.

AW-F*CKING-RIGHT! Now this is the preview I was epxecting for. As it has already been said, the art is amazing, the cards are amazing, everything about this pack looks amazing. I love how Galadriel works almost like a presence in the distance, she's not a hero of action, but rather a guiding force that helps the rest of the heroes. Can't wait to get her.

Wait am I missing something. Why does everyone want to put UC on her?

She only exhausts for her ability and it's limited to once per round. So what the point of readying her?

I think the proper response is "wow, she'd be great... in any other Sphere." She's a really good card, but boring old Eowyn is generally better in my opinion, and she can't compete with the ever-broken Glorfindel.  In any other faction, I would love her, but here it's pretty meh.

 

She splashes... okayish. Going off blue means that you'll likely lose a lot of the questing advantage as your allies will cost 2-3 and often have 1 or 0 willpower, which is nice but not amazing given her weaknesses. As a standalone deck, she would work best with Grima to power out worthwhile cards and manage threat. As a support deck, I could see her and 2x Tactics heroes, where they are dedicated combat and she just manages their threat and draws cards, while providing cheap Spirit cards. You'd lose out on most of the questing advantage, but it'd probably be worth it (so long as the other decks can pick up the slack).

Does anyone else feel like the elven aesthetic is awfully similar to the one in the films? That Nenya, those structures in the background...

As for the other cards,

 

It looks like the Desecrated Ruins treachery adds damage to the active location. Could this mean a battle for locations, similar to Cair Andros?

 

Orophin seems to say something about returning something to our hands. Allies? from play or discard pile?

Galadriel = perfect design (playtest experience pending).  Great job Caleb & Co.  I like seeing heroes follow this line of design:  good synergy, but also globally useful.  Her drawback is thematic and non-crippling, IMO.  Just keep it up!

I think the direction they took with Galadriel is perfect for her character.  Providing unseen support for other people is exactly what she did in the Lord of the Rings storyline.  Her on-card ability to exhaust for card draw and threat reduction is also brilliant.  She would work great in powerful doomed decks, I'm thinking.  The synergies are certainly going to explode this cycle.

What I am really stoked about is Ent. Nice touch, powerful and cheap ally with a drawback, which can be mitigated by readying effects or playing him extremely early.

This does make me wonder if Noldor will play with the doomed key word as one of their mechanics. (As opposed to it just being Isenguard).

I think they might be a good fit for it.

I think most people are just rolling Nenya into Galadriel when they praise the character.

Although it is a significant drawback that she can't use her 4 willpower without drawing it, which is an interesting bit of design (and further encourages a lore/spirit deck for getting card draw or access to word of command).

Really really cool...

I can agree to everything you wrote and can add one point:

 

If you can ready her (Courage, Miruvor, Cram...), you could play Desperate Alliance to use her ability twice in a round, cause it would be the same like Lore-Aragorn.

Why would Noldor have Doomed? They have absolutely nothing to do with the dark arts nor would they be dangerous in their ways or possibly be treacherous... they're the total opposite, complete beings of light. I would love to hear a case for the opposite though, I think it would give it a good identity, albeit strange thematically.

Thematically it could represent their leaving for the West - their time in middle earth grows short and so they only assist for a short time - hence raising your threat.

I mean I guess rather than "doomed" you could have them have "raise your threat" the way Glorfindel does - but I think that "doomed" as a key word is better than "raise your threat" if you want it to apply as effects are played - for instance Noldor events or attachments could have it.

Noldor allies already have an effect to represent this with their card discarding after use.

This is a great point! Desperate Alliance works very well with her along with Unexpected Courage. I just wonder if both players' allies would then not exhaust to commit to quests if you tossed her over before the quest phase. It would seem that a passive ability only works for the player who is currently controlling the character, so probably not...

"Allies you control, do not exhaust to commit to the quest during the round they enter play" 

This is actually a really complicated question rules-wise. For instance:

I own Galadriel and I play Arwen down this turn. On the normal scheme of things Arwen can now quest without exhausting. The question is when is this rule "checked"

If it's "Do you own Galadriel at the time that you play Arwen, that means that Arwen can now quest without exhausting." Or is it checked only in the quest phase which would be, "Arwen was played this round and you own Galadriel during the quest phase, therefore Arwen doesn't exhaust to quest now"

It depends if in rules terms, the ability to exhaust without questing is only checked at the quest stage or whether it's a property that the Arwen card gains as a result of being played while a Galardriel card is in play under your control.

The first instance would only allow the player who owns Galadriel during the quest phase to benefit, the second would allow you to play desperate alliance during the planning phase (after playing your own allies down) to get a double benefit from her.

Currently nothing could occur in between playing Arwen and questing to knock Galadriel out of play - but you could imagine a future encounter card effect that did interupt between planning and the quest phase such that Galadriel was alive when you played Arwen, but dead by the time you actually went to quest. In that instance I would find it more logical to assume that Arwen can still quest without exhausting even though you no longer have Galadriel (that would make it a property that has been bestowed on the Arwen card like a stack in magic).

However other effects in the game so far have tended to work on a simpler check system (do you have the cards in play 'now' at the moment they apply) So I suspect that the rules response will be only the player who owns Galadriel in the quest phase benefits.

I'd say it was worth a rules clarification though because both rules readings are legitimate.

> ...

"Allies you control, do not exhaust to commit to the quest during the round they enter play" 

 

This is a passive effect which only applies when you are committing your characters to the quest. Each player commits any of their characters to the quest at one time, starting with the first player and proceeding clockwise in order. There is a player action window in between each player committing their characters to the quest, so you can use Galadriel and Desperate alliance to have two players' character quest without exhausting.

1. First player controls Galadriel and commits their characters to the quest. Any of the first players' characters which entered play this round do not exhaust.

2. First player plays Desperate Alliance and passes Galadriel to the second player.

3. Second player commits their characters to the quest. Now that they control Galadriel, her passive applies to any of the second players' characters which entered play this round. Those characters do not exhaust.

 

This passive effect, just like the one on Light of Valinor, is only checked at the time a character is committed to the quest. After that, it wouldn't even matter if Galadriel left play - the exhaustion side-effect has already been checked.

Epic preview! As amazing as Galadriel and Nenya are I'm more excited for Orophin and the Ent ally!!! Already run Haldir ally and am already planning to run Rumil, finally have the last brother revealed =)!! Really wish we knew what he did though..
Also, the Ents are awesome... probably gonna chuck 3 in my deck. Low low cost for pretty **** decent stats and only real drawback (who puts attachments on allies?) is they come into play exhausted. After that they're cheap beasts! Also, they aren't really creatures so I for one am happy they didn't get that trait even though it would have been nice for Radagast to have more use.
Going to have to at least TRY to swap out Spiritfindel for Galadriel and see how my lore/spirit deck works that way, can swap in Nenya instead of Asfaloth.... might work perfectly....

Overall a very exciting preview! The art for Galadriel is insanely good (that's one gorgeous elf lord....) and the quest sounds epic as well. God **** all these awesome spoilers with awesome player cards and awesome quests that we aren't actually gonna get our hands on for so **** long....

I'm a little late to the party but how cow, i'm excited to use Galadriel.  I also love how she complements the silvan archetype without either party really needing her by necessity, really great touch.  I love the versatility and player choice they gave us with her too between the high will power and card draw/threat reduction (although UC obviously mitigates this choice).  I think I'm mostly just happy to have another universally useful spirit hero.

 

Exciting to see our first official Ent too, even with the thematically appropriate 1st turn exhaust is till think they are super powerful. WIll be cool to see more of their kind.

 

Lastly, seeing Orophin as a leadership ally just as to mean we get Haldir as a lore hero in the 3rd AP right? Would be appropriate getting all 3 of them this cycle and i dont think they'll change his sphere as he could only go in spirit without doubling up with his brothers and if he was spirit that means we'd have 3 spirit heroes this cycle which seems unlikely.

 

Assuming we do get a lore haldir, that likely means that that the ranger hero in the 4th AP and the hero of the 6th AP would be leadership and tactics to make it 2 heroes per sphere per cycle

 

Also curious to see who our last hero will be, i figured if we were gonna see Galadriel it would have been in the 6th for the grand finale, Caleb and co may have to outdue themselves on this one

Player cards are cool for this one.  That's for sure.  I just hope they don't go easy on us with the quests for this cycle.....  I really like those good, tough, hard thinking ones like Stewards Fear, Morgul Vale, HoN.......   I have to say, I wasn't too impressed with the VoI quests.  

 

I also want at least one quest were you have to do something different to get past a quest stage rather than just questing. Sort of like some of the locations in AoO (pay 1 resource to place 1 progress on location....exhaust hero to place 1 progress) except on the quest card.  

 

Maybe in the The Nin-in-Eilph you should have to discard characters (to distract a big boss swamp monster ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) so you can make progress.  Maybe something like "Each player must discard a character they control to be able to commit to the quest" or maybe a swamp monster enemy during one stage that reads (10 threat, cannot be engaged. Quest Phase Action: Any player may discard a character to reduce this enemy's threat by 3)  

 

Looking forward to these quests and cool enemies.

Some random thoughts after reflection: if I were to design an attachment called "Mirror of Galadriel". It would most likely be something like, "Attach to Galadriel. Exhaust Mirror of Galadriel and Galadriel to draw a card and reduce your threat by one."

So I kinda don't think we'll be getting the mirror. Unless it's as "Galadriel does not exhaust ..."

Orophin needs to be ranged like both of his brothers. Helps with Rumil's ability.

Wandering Ent... That's some cheap power right there.

Really intrigued by the Silvan Spirit hero now. Mono-Spirit elves my precious. Three Councils, three Greetings and three Books of Earnil. Forty five points of threat reduction without an Aragorn in sight.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think we've received confirmation that we're getting a spirit silvan hero. We know that the hero in the 2nd AP will be spirit but no trait was given and we know the hero in the 3rd AP will be silvan but no sphere was given

I might be a moron but I think Miravor could potentially be a better fit for her than UC if you have other card draw in the deck.  She turns Miravor into an instant power card IMHO.

Nenya's ability seems to synergize well with one of the core sets most under-used cards, "The Favor of the Lady". Just as this gives willpower to others, so does Nenya allow Galadriel to extend her "favor" on other characters. I like the thematic ties across these two cards.

Favour of the Lady is my favourite art perhaps in the whole game, at least as a portrait. However, it is hard to justify using the card, it is expensive for what little it does.

I don't know that Miruvor is better, but it certainly works well with Galadriel.  You can play it, use Nenya, ready Galadriel by discarding Miruvor and putting it on top of your deck, use Galadriel's ability to draw Miruvor and lower threat, and repeat this process every turn.  And if you have card draw, it's even more effective (so that you're seeing more cards than just Miruvor.  But,  it's not as cost effective as Unexpected Courage, and you won't gain card advantage like you would with Unexpected Courage, but for people with one Core Set (like myself), it's a good alternative.

Yes, it is indeed surprising to see Galadriel in the penultimate pack; however, they have been rather strong in the past, Mirkwood had Boromir and Dwarrodelf Glorfindel, both perhaps the strongest heroes in their spheres at the time (at least). Against the Shadow, on the other hand, had Caldara, but even Théoden (as he is) was not a winner as the final pack hero, for me.

Yes you can, if by synergy I meant "thematic" synergy, as in Galadriel likes adding willpower to other heroes and characters...both cards do this.

Okay, this is bloody amazing. I cannot add much to what has been already said about the awesomeness of Galadriel and her bling. Let's just stay I am awfully, terribly excited. I think I have never been so eager to get my hands on any expansion to our beloved game. For the first time I am considering to proxy this, I just cannot wait, not that many months. Torture.

 

There is one more point I wish to make, apart from stating my glorious optimism. All the enthusiasm that pours out of everyone here proves one thing. Generally, players love to get cool and useful toys. I think the designers should follow the recent way of Celeborn, Grima or Galadriel, meaning that they should issue player cards that makes us all go "wow, so many uses, can't wait to this or that combo". I mean we should abandon once and for all the concept of all those spirit Pippins that are useful, but only when you have 100% hobbit heroes, or with Theodens whose buffs mean anything only in few cases. Galadriel is fun, multi-optional, fits in variety of decks, and makes you take decisions. Flexibility means fun. Combos are cool. More power in the hands of the player means more creativity, more tabletop drama, even for the price of much more difficult scenarios. Bring it, FFG, you have just proved you are perfectly capable.

I wish you'd posted this on my UC thread - its a lot more succinct than what I wrote. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

As for a more limited design that "forces" card choice (Spirit pippin and 100% hobbits) I think that has a place in the game too. You can have more powerful card effects if you allow them to be more restricted - if all cards were unrestricted you would lose a lot of the flavour of the different traits and races.

It adds to Galadriel's flavour that she was willing to help anyone against the shadow (as she was in the books) - where as Thorin was only interested in dwarfs (as were most of his company - hence their hero designs), if they were both unrestricted they would both be less flavorful (though Thorin would just be more powerful).

I'm not sure that spirit pippin is good enough in his power level to justify 100% hobbits - on the other hand being able to guarantee you don't engage an enemy - ever, is pretty nice. I would say that at 3 threat cost it should have been not just hobbits - but if it had been cost 1 threat 100% hobbits would have been justified. (We may see a resurgence of spirit pippin with the new hobbit support we've gotten, but I doubt it because the lore version is so good, and lore is a better sphere for hobbits to get access too).

SOLID GOLD ! ! !

 

Caleb and Matt really deliver with these new cards. Much has already been said about the mechanics of these new cards so I'm going to focus on the flavor. In the books Galadriel was the great enabler who was constantly working behind the scenes to fight Sauron but didn't actually get her own hands dirty. This is perfectly described by the mechanics (and art!) of these new cards. I think it's absolutely perfect and even though we haven't seen all of the elf cards yet, the functionality of the new elf deck is pretty obvious and it's a perfect flavor/mechanics matchup. I have no doubt that the new elf decks will feel very "elfy", especially to anyone who has read the books and knows the lore behind the elves. After "Black Riders" gave us flavorful hobbit decks I was very optimistic about what would come next but this is even better than I had hoped for.

 

Thank you Caleb and Matt, please keep up the good work!

 

Now please get these AP's out to us as soon as possible......

I'm quite intrigued by the scenario. Locations that get destroyed and "The Secret Chambers" text hint at a race between the orcs and heroes to find the forge. Sounds promising.

 

 

Galadriel looks awesome and certainly offers some new variants in strategy. I'm not sure if I like the synergy between Nenya and her - it's perhaps a bit over the top. Giving her only 2 WP and a threat level of 7 wouldn't have been too bad, too.

Just becuase it couldn't match the exact same way you think the mirror should be (which is the same as Galadriel's ability, for some reason) is no reason to think there won't be any mirror. The mirror of Galadriel is the perfect scrying theme in the story besides the palantiri ("some things which have not yet come to pass"), it should be obviously about scrying, either your deck or the encounter deck.

Yeah maybe.  Certainly adding a scry to her draw ability would kick it up a notch.  "Exhaust Mirror of Galadriel and raise your threat by 1 to look at the top three cards of your deck and return them in any order."

As for Galadriel's artwork, it is definetely beautiful. If I could have my wish though I would like that she had more malice in her look, sparks of some unimagined plots running behind her eyes. As of now she is a stunning lady but perhaps lacks that hidden uncertainity that surrounds her character in the books. Oh well, still a 8/10 artwork in my book as it stands.

Maybe I am a bit spoiled by Ms Blanchette's portrayal of her in the movies. It was well done I think because her Galadriel was noble, misterious and beautiful, but not in an obvious way.

So who here think that this cycle will include a Noldor/Silvan-specific readying attachment? We already have one for Rangers (Wingfoot), Rohan (Steed of the Mark, Rohan Warhorse), Gondor (Steed of the Mark), Hobbits (Fast Hitch), and Dwarves (kinda: Ever My Heart Rises). Either that, or the attachment for the Noble trait will be another readying effect, which would be usable on every Noldor/SIlvan hero with the exception of Mirlonde.

I do not think Elves will get a specific one, since they have already got Light of Valinor -- though it is not a "readying" thing per se. A much better chance for Noble; however, I think each of the four trait boosters (Captain of Gondor, Wingfoot and the two more to come) will do a different thing, thus since Wingfoot is a readying tool, Noble might get a different treatment.

Very good thoughts. Light of Valinor escaped my mind since I always just associate it with Glorfindel. That probably is more than enough "readying" for elves. You're also probably right about the card for Nobles. It's probably something for resource generation. I originally wasn't thinking that it would be for readying, but I was just thinking that if elves didn't get a readying ability then they could potentially do it through the Noble trait, but since we have Light of Valinor, I'm probably wrong on both accounts. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

No, I think your reasoning makes total sense. For the cost of 1, Light of Valinor would be too good if not unique, but it is a shame you can only use it for one particular Elf. And when I first thought of the four trait attachments, I did think Leadership will cover Noble and action advantage. It was only when we saw Wingfoot that my mind got confused in this regard -- Lore does need action advantage however.

 

Almost all Silvan and Noldor heroes are Noble, all but Mirlonde I believe, but only Elrohir is Leadership -- just some more randomly rant of mine.

Maybe this has already been answered (haven't read through the whole thread) but is Galadriel's threat-reducing ability limited to once per round or once per round per player? Asking this because of the rather surprising ruling on Loragorn and Desperate Alliance. With UC, she could lower 2 players' threat in a single round.

I would suspect that the limit of once per round is for the activating player; thus if you want to use it on more players in a single round you would still need Desperate Alliance.

But it does beget interesting questions like: does that go for all "once per round" abilities like Beravor etc (I suspect, yes). But how about Éowyn? Her ability is once per round per player. In the case of Éowyn I suspect the answer to be that she cannot be passed around for extra discarding goodness, since all the players are "activating players" no matter who controls her.

 

Not all of us found the Loragorn and DA combo all that surprising, given the ruling of Landroval. We have been using it in my group from day one.

Great news really looking forward to Galadrial.

I have not read all the posts contained in the thread, but anyone thinking about teaming her up with Grima?

His doomed effect could be nullified by her ability, and also draw a card. With Keys of Orchanc, you could get some of the higher cost silvan lore allies into play easily, she will also gain lore with her ring. Maybe have Celeborn as the other hero for some more silvan synergy. Starting threat 28 is not so bad.

Certainy not thematic, but could be good, maybe.

Yeah, Galadriel/Grima/Celeborn sounds good. A nice positive of Celeborn that I haven't seen mentioned too much is his 3 willpower, as the Leadership heroes generally only have 1 or 2 (Thorin and Sam excepted). This will give you a good starting point to make up for Galadriel not being able to contribute to questing at first. Once you get Nenya on her, she could pump Celeborn up to 7 willpower, and if he gets Light of Valinor, then he can do all that while still being available for combat. All in all, I'm really digging the Celeborn/Galadriel synergy in terms of both stats and abilities. Really nicely done. 

## 104 [Tracker1 on May 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105624-new-preview-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1083207)

I tried this Galadriel, Celeborn, Grima line up, worked pretty good. i used a bunch of proxies for some of the other Silvan cards spoiled.

First off Galadriel seems really, really good. Drop in 1 or more allies per round that don't need to exhaust to quest is absolutely amazing. That ability alone is totally worth her not doing much, but with the ring she can give that extra WP boost is awesome.

Partnered up with Celeborn each silvan ally entering play is boosted, and does not have to exhaust to quest, amazing. Her ability to draw a card and reduce threat kept my threat hovering in the low 30's even with Grima. With 1 Unexpected Courage she's phenomenal. Grima seemed a good fit for the deck, with Keys attached to Galadriel with ring attached can drop in those higher cost lore allies quickly.

I put together a quick deck with just silvan allies I have not used in ages, Lorien Guide, may just become useful again, i even had Silvelode Archer, although I don't think he'll make the final cut. Really looking forward to the other cards, but with so many other good ones coming out it's going to be hard to fit them all in one deck.

From what I've experienced silvan is going to be very fun to play, and Celeborn and especially Galadriel are going to open up some neat new deck building opportunities. Beyond speculation, their abilities seemed to work great, and the designers did a great job of capturing theme and functionality here. Very cool!

Now the agony of waiting.

Yes, same happened to me: Light of Valinor has read "attach to Glorfindel" to me since the beginning. But in fact, it is great for Celeborn also. The problem only arises when all these potential candidates happen to be in the game together.

It's admittedly not the most thematic thing in the world, as technically only Noldor should be able to benefit from the Light of Valinor, but in terms of gameplay, I guess all the Elves need some love.

True, but when you have to choose, Light of Valinor fits better to Noldor heroes anyway (Glorfindel most, Elrond next, Elladan and Elrohir to an extent). But if you do not have them, and at the same time have Celeborn, he is certainly a good candidate.

Why can only Noldor benefit from the light of Valinor? All the elves can reside there.

I mean technically isn't the light of Valinor actually just the sun and moon? (After the trees were cut down)?

Not really.  From the Tolkien Gateway:

 

"The Light of Valinor was a term [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Light_of_Valinor#] that referred not only to the glorious, unsullied light of the Two Trees [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Two_Trees], but also to the pure wisdom and understanding that those living in the Blessed Realm [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Blessed_Realm] possessed.

The Light of Valinor derived from light before any fall [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Arda_Marred] and is the light of art binded with reason and good bound with beauty.

The Light of Valinor appeared to be a quality that the inhabitants of Aman [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Aman] could spread to others: the Eldar [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Eldar] who went there and were instructed by the Valar [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Valar] gained much wisdom and beauty, so that they surpassed all other Elven [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Elves] races in greatness. When the Noldor [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Noldor] came back to Middle-earth [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Middle-earth] in the First Age [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/First_Age], they spread the Light of Valinor that was in them to the Edain [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Edain], so that the Edain became a nobler people."

The quote from Distractionbeast summed it up. The Light of Valinor represents the wisdom and enhanced state that the Noldor were granted by actually living in Valinor and learning directly from the Valar (and Maiar). The attachment represents this power and higher state of being (best exemplified by Frodo seeing Glorfindel as a being of pure light when he is in his wraith-like state). Silvan (and Sindar) never made it to Valinor, and so they technically aren't on the same level and never received this instruction. I can buy a thematic justification that the Silvan can benefit from Light of Valinor indirectly by being taught by the Noldor (such as Galadriel teaching her people), but it's just interesting because the main and primary distinction between Noldor and Silvan is whether or not they lived in Valinor.

Yeah, it should be only Noldor and not be unique. But if not unique, it would be too good for 1 cost, so it would have had to be 2, and then we would have had to agree with Rapier and others who claim that Unexpected Courage is wrong. Or maybe it could have been non-unique, 2-cost but neutral...
