 So I know that this is a dumb question, but I have a question about the Bofur in The Redhorn Gate.  If you use his ability to put him into a quest, but then you quest unsuccessfully, does he stay in play?

Thanks

And note that actually there are three quest results: successful (total willpower > total threat in staging area); fail (total willpower < total threat in staging area); and neither (total willpower = total threat in staging).  So Bofur will stay in both the second and third cases.
