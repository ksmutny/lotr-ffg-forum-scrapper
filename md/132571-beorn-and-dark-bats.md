What happens if Beorn (Hero) defends an attack from Dark Bats?

Since he can't have attachments, do you ignore the forced effect?Â  I assume that's the case, but I could also see a possibility that they try to attach and get discarded because Beorn shrugs them off.

Usually, when something fail to happen, nothing happen.

Like venom keyword when you don't have card left...
