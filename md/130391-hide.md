When I start 2B or 3B from Shadow of the Past I must first make a hide test from the Black Rider or I must shuffle the encounter deck first?

How can I ask to Caleb this Question?

In the More section on top of page you will see Customer Service and then a Rules Question

Sorry for the lack of replies!  I would shuffle first as part of the resolution of the "search" effect, since you're supposed to shuffle anytime you search.  Otherwise you know exactly what is going to come out during your Hide test, which would neuter the test.
