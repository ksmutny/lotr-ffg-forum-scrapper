If anyone at FFG is reading and could pass this on, there are a few things I would really like to see added to the quest log.

 

1) See what heroes my friends used for their quests.  Seeing the icon doesn't really help.  Them beating a quest with 2 tactics and 1 lore really doesn't tell me anything about their deck.

2) See what notes my friends put for their quests,  I put in my quest log where i lost my points if possible, what bonus points I got, and any other things of interest.  If anyone else does anything similar, I'd love to read them.

3) Compare my quests verse all my friends.  Its nice comparing on a friend by friend basis, but it would be even better to see which of my friends have done the best on each quest with out having to filter through 10 different screens.

4) Put in your partner's heroes in multiplayer games.  In the Ring mouse over it could show your notes and also show the heroes of every other player.

 

As it is right now, its such a weak tool that it really is only worth it for keeping record of your own games. Which is a great thing.  But it seems like it could easily be so much more.

I would like to second the op.  The quest log is nice, but it has so much more potential.

All the above, but particularly this point!

If you want your ideas to have any effect, you should post them using the Support Request link at the bottom of this page.

FFG employees don't read the boards (or rather it's company policy that they don't react on posts with the exception of posts specifically started by one of them to gather feedback).

I did just that.  Thanks.
