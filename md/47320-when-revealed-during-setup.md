I have seen this question asked on BGG, so far unanswered, and I was wondering myself. Is "When Revealed" effect applied during setup?

## 2 [ClydeCloggie on May 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47320-when-revealed-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=474340)

Yes, they are. Although most of the time they won't actually do anything as a lot of them affect characters on the quest or exhausted characters, which you won't have at that time.

Except for Pursued by Shadow, which annoys me terribly when it shows up.

Caught in a Web - even worse I'd say.

During set up if a Caught in the Web shows up... can Eleanor use her Response to exhaust and ditch it?  I don't see why not but its a little out of the ordinary.

I've seen the argument made that since the game hasn't started during setup, she cannot use her ability. This is nonsense to me. If the game hasn't started, why then, would the encounter's effects be live? It's either one or the other: either all effects are live or none are live. Talk about a contradiction if it wasn't.

It isn't nonsense it's an undefined area of the rules. During setup you're in limbo. Until the rules are revised, there's no way to tell what happens and what doesn't happen.

If the rules don't dictate otherwise, consistency is king. Eleanor being able to use her ability to cancel a treachery effect is consistent. Switching off one card type during setup is not.

This is even more true with the rule revision on surge and doomed in that they activate during setup, whereas in the RAW, they didn't.

I liked the original better what do you do. Anyway, when Caught in a Web, what do you do if the attachment comes to the prisoner, keep it? And it may be a bit harder to pick the prisoner randomly when one of them has an Objective attached to it. Haha.

## 10 [Vyron2 on May 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47320-when-revealed-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=474940)

 yeah, eleanor probably can use her ability... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] since the vile encounter deck also swings its strikes against our formidable heroes... 

 

I don't think that you can attach anything to the prisoner... at least not after he's been captured... the "old" attachments... I guess you could go either way with them being discarded or kept in the next "cell" of the dungeon, thus when rescued, the prisoner regains his attachments (only possible in nightmare mode)... but what about caught in a web?idk...

## 11 [lleimmoen on May 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47320-when-revealed-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=475055)

The last time we played Nightmare, we would discard all the cards from play between the scenarios, as well as resources, kept the threat and cards in hand. It was still rather easier with the cards in hands, so next time we will discard them as well and draw a new set of 6 before Anduin and Dol Guldur. Either way, previous attachments are no deal but Caught in a Web - I'd really like to hear.

Encounter Keywords
Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play, including during setup.

So i understand it like this. If you reveal card during setup with surge or doom and guarded is ok is working. But if you reveal caught in the web or Dol goldur orks you just put in discard (in the case of caught in the web) In case of orcs you add them to staging area ignore the damage text.

I get it right???

## 13 [Vyron2 on May 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47320-when-revealed-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=476880)

 if caught in a web is revealed - you resolve it: this means you attach it to a player's hero....

you put orcs of dol guldur in the staging area, ONLY ignoring its effect, because there is no hero questing in the setup phase...

## 14 [Glaurung on May 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47320-when-revealed-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=476908)

Ok thanks for answer. But why you think so???? Somewhere in rulebook  have a explanation?? I did find any.

## 15 [Morbid666 on May 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47320-when-revealed-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=477192)

IMO, yes. "when revealed" and encounter keywords should be used during set up(remember, setup is not a phase and can happen as soon as you get through the previous quest-like going from 1b to 2b can happen DURING the quest or even the encounter phase...keep that in mind). Now with that clear, you should also be able to use responses and abilitiies as normal too. The key is to have fun and if you think there is nothing solid in the rules go with common sense and what you and your freinds think is best...just don't give yourself an advantage or disadvantage, do what seems right and have a good timehappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

## 16 [SiCK_Boy on May 30, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47320-when-revealed-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=477218)

Personnally, if I get the Caught in a Web, I put it on one of my characters. If that character is then made prisoner, I leave the attachment with him and he still has it when (if) rescued.

Ok and i understand you point. But i prepare my self for the tournaments in the future so i need to know for sure how is work. I use to play decipher lotr a lot (tournaments and many events) i take it as a sport hobby. So i need now for sure. Will wait for the FAQ from FFG

## 18 [Morbid666 on June 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47320-when-revealed-during-setup/?do=findComment&comment=482425)

I should have said this from the begining. Read page 22 of the rulebook, bottom left corner. It is called Ques Advancement. We will see i was right, even during set up when revealed takes place.

Surge and doomed only work during the staging step in the quest phase. They do not trigger during setup. 

Dol Guldur Orcs is a when revealed effect, so it would be active at all times, including during setup, but since no one is questing it doesn't apply.

I disagree with ignoring Caught in a Web's effect. Again, it is a when revealed effect, which means it is active at any time the card comes into play. Notice the difference with something like surge, which specifies only during quest staging.

If you read the errata, you'd know Surge and Doomed do trigger during setup. I don't see why though. And the rulebook said otherwise.

This is incorrect. It FAQ specifies that they do trigger at all times including during setup.

I stand corrected on surge and doomed. I had forgotten about it in the FAQ. Wonder why they would change that rule so quickly. It seemed to work fine as it was.

Exactly. What happened in those few weeks after release? And what had been happening during play testing? It is not like they forgot about this, it is that they changed their mind...

I like to imagine that the rules authors had a good rulebook which they passed off to the editors and rulebook visual designers who then bungled the specifics of the rules. Then by the time the rules authors realize the rulebook is different then their rules it is too late and the game is already at the printers.
