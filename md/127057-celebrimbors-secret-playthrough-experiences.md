# [Celebrimbor&#039;s Secret Playthrough Experiences](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127057-celebrimbors-secret-playthrough-experiences/)

Got my pack last night at my FLGS and got one game in with the quest last night, so consider this a quest description plus first impressions for everyone who's waiting on the pack.  (In other words, if you want to go in blind like I did, don't read this :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])

The idea of the quest is that you're racing against Bellach and his orcs to find a ring mold in Celembrimbor's forge.  The new key word is Scour, which is like Lost from the Long Dark in that it doesn't do anything by itself but lots of encounter cards key off of it.  I can't remember the names of the other two encounter sets the quest uses, but they're the same two used in To Catch an Orc (the orc symbol and the wolf/moon symbol).  An objective card sits in the staging are all game called "The Orc's Search."  For every card under Orc's Search, you have to raise your threat at the end of the round.  The encoutner deck puts damage on locations, and when those locations get damage equal to their quest points, they go under Orc's Search (and there are other effects that add cards to it too). Bellach stays in the staging area for most of the quest and his threat equals the number of cards under Orc's Search.  He has a scour effect that makes each player search for an enemy and add it to the staging area.  Celebrimbor's Forge also starts in the staging area with the mold  attached to it, and you have to travel to it and explore it before it gets too damaged, otherwise you lose.  Both quest stages had "Time 3: trigger all Scour effects in play" on them, and you will always at least trigger Bellach's scour effect.

It's a combo heavy enctouner deck with loads of surge/other ways of bringing out extra encounter cards.  Playing two-fisted, I typically faced 3-5 encounter cards a turn.  The encounter deck is on the larger side, at least compared to the deck sizes we've been getting.  The scour combos are nasty and there's tons of "choose x or y" encounter cards, meaning there's lots of decisions to be made.   I imagine it will be easier solo (but not easy) and brutally hard in multi-player.  I played it two-fisted with two strong decks (Galadriel-Celeborn-Grima silvan and Gandalf-Boromir-Legolas from my Road Darkens play throughs) and squeaked out a victory my first (and only) time through.  The encounter deck almost TKO'd me on turn two by destroying Celebrimbor's forge, but I lucked out and it didn't.  I played aggressively, clearing the board as often as I could so that there weren't too many scour effects going off when time ran out.  Clearing locations is important too, because you don't want to lose them to the Orc's Search, but there are encounter cards that make it more difficult to explore locations.  The encounter deck does a good job of keeping pressure on you so that you never feel totally comfortable (well,until the final turn when I knew I'd win).

Overall, I'd compare it to To Catch an Orc in that if you start fast and stay ahead of the encounter deck, you have a good chance of victory.  If you try to turtle and fall behind, you're going to be in a lot of trouble.  Lots of interesting mechanics, lots of strategic decision making, and I'll be interested to try it again and see how it goes.  I think the larger encounter deck and reliance on combos will make it play a little different every time.  The sweet spot for difficulty is probably two players.

And NO MORE NALIR!!!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] He totally ditches you at the beginning.

Sounds great. So far besides Three Trials which is awesome I haven't enjoyed the quests in this cycle. The Dunland Trap was alright just not that interesting. I'm hoping this quest picks up the pace.

So I think this cycle has been amazing so far.....my favorite quests being Nin-In-Eilph and The Three Trials. I think Trouble in Tharbad was great as well and Celebrimbor's Secret also looks awesome. The only one I didn't enjoy that much was The Dunland Trap.
Not sure why you don't like it so much Glaurung?

A few of them are definitely harder than most of the Dwarrowdelf or Mirkwood cycle (except RtM and Shadow and Flame), there are fantastic player cards in this cycle and the art is better than ever.
They were never going to be that difficult... its just a normal cycle not nightmare or POD so I'm kind of confused as to why you aren't enjoying it thus far?
The only thing I personally can really say against it is that each quest requires more set up and has more intricate mechanics than most earlier quests from the other cycles so it takes a bit more time to play these quests. This doesn't really bother me but I can see it being an issue with others.

I think its potentially the best cycle or at least second best behind Dwarrowdelf.

I found Trouble in Tharbad to be a pale comparison of Peril in Peralinger where it actually felt like you were in a city trying to avoid detection. Basically that quest can be won by just questing from start to finish no real fear or excitement. Nin-in-eliph was a good idea but the small encounter deck that had almost no enemies in it really sapped some of its joy. Overall this is my least favorite cycle so far.

Difficult level is ok. Definitely is quite hard compare the other cycle. But I dont like the story, no any really exiting ideas (quest mechanics). Players cards a good. I think players cards is more interesting then Against the Shadow cycle but quests looks a simple. Dont get me wrong I like it but….. Release of the new nightmares sets for old cyckles make me happy otherwise this time is to boring for me….

Just finished my first game and it wasn't so bad solo. I can see that it might be insane in 3 or 4 player though. It's very easy to keep the staging area clear in solo and then the scour triggers don't really cause any ill effects. That get's much harder in multi-player.

Try it in the multiplayer if you'll get a chance. You'll be surprised.

Man, I've really enjoyed the quests this cycle, I just haven't gotten to play them as much as I would have liked. I think there are some ingenious mechanics going on and Three Trials is pure brilliance. I really love Trouble in Tharbad since it allows you to use some secrecy cards with any deck!

The only quest i haven't never won still in 4 players is Dunland Trap. This quest must be faqqed ^^

 

The list of how i like these quests:

 

1. Nin-in-eliph

2. Dunland Trap

3. 3 Trials

4. Trouble in Tharbag

 

Nin-in-eliph is the best, but i'd like a third enemy, not only the snake and the *****.

Three plays three wins. Might be the most forgettable for the solo player. I think after TAC is released I'm going to try the cycle again two handed.

I think CS will be a beast multi-player, but it's pretty easy solo.

Have not played CS yet, but i agree Nin-in-eliph is the best of the cycle so far, and for solo at least for me it was the most challenging. The random stage cards make the scenario unpredictable each time. 3 trials on the surface seemed more difficult, but once the formula for beating it was figured out it was pretty easy. It's difficult to come up with formula to beat Nin-in-eliph in The same way. I'm going to come back to this one regularly. It might be a new deck tester for me.

Aww man. I was hoping for a good challenge for pure solo. I've been playing both pure solo and two-handed solo throughout the cycle, and I have to say that generally two-handed remains more fun and more challenging (with the exception of The Three Trials).

Yeah this quest is a lot of fun and you really try and race through it to avoid the pile up that will happen from those scour effects. I played both 2 handed and solo with Silvan decks, a blast both times but it was a little easier solo.

As I sau before only a last quest looks interesting for me…. After briliant nightmare cards for second cycle 2 new quests looks a boring for solo.

Tree trials is ok, Dunadan trap is cool. Will see what we will get in last pack. Anyway still belive is worse cycle from the quest site and very good cycle from the player card side.

I got Celebrimbor's Secret yesterday and am enjoying the player cards. The quest itself looks great but I can't play it yet - I want to play the cycle in order and I still haven't beaten The Dunland Trap... granted, I've "only" tried about 5-6 times and I play lore/spirit. Maybe I should ask my gf to join in with her battle dwarf deck.

Played twice with silvan deck lost first and one second. Seems like it can be pretty easy to get location locked in the early game so decent amout of WP needs to be genrated early similar to To Cath an Orc. Lots of 2 - 3 threat cards in the encounter deck and a few untimly scour effects can have things spiral down hill quickly. However, once the staging area is under control and being cleaned out each round it is not so bad.

In both my games I did not find the damage on locations to be a big issue, and only one location was ever placed under the orc search card.

I'll have to give it some more tries, but I would not say it's easy, although I did beat it on my second attempt. It's a bit of chore to check all the scour effects with the time mechanic, which i think takes the fun out of playing a bit for me. At first I really liked time mechanic, but now it becoming a bit more of a chore to play the scenarios, and that's probably why I have not and probably will continue to not revisit many of these scenarios in the future.

Yes I agree with you. As I say before this cycle quests will be quickly forgoten… . nothing special and time mechanic also not as good as sound in begin….

Had my first attempt today, played two player with a friend and we won but only by the slimmest of margins.  It was such a terrible victory it felt like a loss.  The encounter deck does do a good job of combo-ing off itself but for the most part its a relatively run of the mill quest.  Knowing what to expect and planning for that should take the edge off my future attempts with it

My shop get 2 new pack and i will take it tomorrow. But I'm not exiting at all about quests.....Just only wonna get player cards....

 

Anyway we have a brilliant Nightmare quest for second cycle and KD so there is something to play. One quest is warm my feeling us Altered Crown or some? The last pack! Hope that will be good!

For solo one-handed Niin-in-eliph is more difficult then CS. One thing that takes the edge off some of the recent scenarios and especially CS is enemy cards have very high engagement cost. I'm able to take a deck with Gandalf, Galadriel, and Elrond and still have not much problem in the early game, and by late game just crush the scenario. Nin-in-elph I would have much harder time doing that, mostly due to the restrictions of the stage cards, which is really the only thing the scenario has going for it and can make it more of a challenge. Also, smaller encounter deck is more punishing, the large encounter deck of CS dilutes the power of the deck.

I wonder if small encounter deck could be abused. Just think of it:

Multiplayer with 4 playing running a monolore deck each, each having 3 copies of Out of Wild and 3 copies of Scroll of Isildur and stuff. Distill the encounter deck until there no threatening cards left?

Yep, this one is a bit disappointing in solo mode. Played a Gondor deck against it without having any difficulties at all. Next will be a Galadriel deck, I'm quite excited about that.

## 31 [Glowwyrm on November 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127057-celebrimbors-secret-playthrough-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=1342448)

Played it twice more with the same decks, picked up a loss then a win.  On my second game, I took 6 encounter cards on turn two then another 5 on turn three.  The combos triggered scour and stacked 5 cards under The Orc's Search.  I made it to stage two, but threated out before I could complete it.  Then on game three, I cruised to an easy win with nothing of note happening.  I think Tracker nailed it, in that the encounter deck is too big to be consistently nasty (unless you're in multiplayer).

Overall, this has been my favorite cycle in terms of quests.  Every scenario introduces a new and interesting idea, and the designers have done a good job of using game mechanics to tell a story.  The only dud quest they've released this year was Into Fangorn, and they've released some really good ones this year (To Catch an Orc, Three Trials, Trouble in Tharbad, Nin-in-Eilph, all Road Darkens Quests, have all received several play-throughs).  Every quest has had at least something interesting to commend it.  I understand if people think there's too much to keep track of (and in some scenarios it's a lot) but that hasn't really bothered me.  My only complaint is that the scenarios in this cycle have worse scaling issues than normal.  I pretty much only play two-handed now, because that seems to be the consistent difficulty sweet spot.

OK i play Galadriel silvan deck now...... Galadriel/Haldir/Celeborn.

 

She is super cool!!!! And same time i cannot say she is broken! Before silvan didn play solo really since was not enough power. With her and Orophin as well now is enough! Silvan solo deck is working.

Manage to win Blood of Gondor and Wather in the water (Nmode of course). I

like the way how silvan deck play with her! Glorifindel was out straight away! Her ring in this deck also super cool! Now i will try beat some other Nightmare quests!

It absolutely makes no sense to pair her with Celeborn. Their abilities are too similar.

Are you kidding!? She is what makes Sivan and Celeborn work so well in solo. I see that their abilities compliment each other perfectly, stat boost and not exhausting when entering play along with silvan bouncing in out of play to take advantage of both abilities regularly.

Silvan is really solid trait now. Probably 3 rd strongest in the game behind Outlands and Dwarves.

Celeborn already works pretty good in my decks. I don't see what Galadriel has to offer beside her ability to keep the threat low. However, thats not the point. You can use Galadriel for a Silvan deck or you can use Celeborn. But why both? Besides, if you wanna use the max out of Galadriel, you should at least have another spirit ally. And then you pop out one 2 cost spirit ally after the other. One. By. One.

The Galadriel-Celeborn-insert Lore hero deck is utterly awesome.  For non-solo, I use Haldir because he can attack around the board.  I took that deck plus a Gandalf-Tactics deck through Nightmare Peril in Pelagir twice and cruised to comfortable wins.  In a Spirit deck, not exhausting to quest isn't useful, because most of your spirit allies are only good at questing.  I could see Galadriel being good in a Caldara deck with Spirit, but where she'll really shine is with other spheres that want to dump lots of allies into play.  That's why she's so good with Silvan, because Celeborn boosts them up so they will always contribute something to the quest, then they can attack or defend or exhaust for A Very Good Tale or anything else.   And O Lorien lowers their cost, so you're dumping at least one, usually two into play a turn.

I knew since they announced Galadriel there would be only 2 solo silvan decks, Celeborn-lore hero-Legolas and Celeborn-lore hero-Galadriel. And I assumed Galadriel would be the better one, and it seems I was right. Having all your silvan allies +1 willpower and not exhaust to commit is insane, and it only gets better with Nenya. Looking forward to building this deck.

Are you kidding!? She is what makes Sivan and Celeborn work so well in solo. I see that their abilities compliment each other perfectly, stat boost and not exhausting when entering play along with silvan bouncing in out of play to take advantage of both abilities regularly.

Silvan is really solid trait now. Probably 3 rd strongest in the game behind Outlands and Dwarves.



Celeborn already works pretty good in my decks. I don't see what Galadriel has to offer beside her ability to keep the threat low. However, thats not the point. You can use Galadriel for a Silvan deck or you can use Celeborn. But why both? Besides, if you wanna use the max out of Galadriel, you should at least have another spirit ally. And then you pop out one 2 cost spirit ally after the other. One. By. One.

Just try her with Celeborn. After 3 rounds you smile to yourself. … ..

Oops. Of course y'all are correct. Looks that my exams stress me so hard that i hallizunated Galadhrim's Minstrels ability on Celeborn.

Finally tried Nin and CS last night, with an Elrond, Galadriel, Celeborn deck of Silvans. Nin was a problem any time In Need of Rest came out (partially because all my copies of Test of Will are in another deck...), but CS felt much like others have said: when it combos, the encounter deck is nasty, but once in control it's hard to lose control. I lost once from an excess of Orcs on the table, which Silvans can have trouble clearing.

 

I like Galadriel a lot though. Her abilities are all useful - I like that her boost of willpower can allow you to quest with relatively few people, and have the back-up of adding 4 willpower just in case. If you don't use it, reduce threat and draw a card! Having allies auto-quest when they hit the table is amazing. Double use of original Gandalf (which I actually forgot about in my game, and exhausted him to quest!) is awesome. And Silvans are really fun to play. Powerful and fun, which is a good mix! Only stalling point was if the deck didn't draw either Galadriel's ring or O Lorien. In either case, it got rather difficult!

I have just played it. 4 times. 2 wins and 2 lost. When i played a hobbit deck we lost (but that deck is too bad, i only played thinking hobbits could go ahead hidden.., as the thematic of this scenario), and the other 2 games with silvans, both players.

 

I say i enjoyed a lot. I dont know how it runs still in 4 players or solo, but atm i felt it very funny.

I finally got ahold of this quest.  We played 2-player last night and won on the first attempt with Theoden-Mablung-Sam and Idraen-Glorfindel(S)-Elrond.  Elrond with Arwen, Burning Brand, and Unexpected Courage was enough to handle most defense, but we had Mablung questing for 3 with Wingfoot and a Gondorian Shield as a backup defender.  Asfaloth and a Northern Tracker kept the board pretty clear of locations, and also acted as a free readying device for Idraen to get an extra action in where needed.  Overall we had a pretty easy time of it, but I think we got some easy early turns: no enemies on the board until round 3 (other than Bellach).  We never had a location go under The Orcs' Search.

 

Nicely thematic quest, seems on the easy side if approached with the right decks, but a nice challenge level for what I prefer.  I could see myself coming back to this one.

Just got to try this quest for the first time last night and something stood out to me that no-one has even hinted at (that I could find) but which seems so obvious to me:

 

This quest seems to be a direct parallel to "Raiders of the Lost Ark" to such a blatant degree that I cannot believe, I haven´t been able to find any comments on it.

 

Specifically the part in the desert where the nazis are trying to find the Well of Souls (secret chamber anyone?)

 

Some lines are taken almost directly from the movie:

(paraphrasing)

RotLA: "They only have one side of the amulet" ; "They are digging in the wrong place"

CS: "They only have half of the map" ; "They are digging in the wrong place"

 

The name of the guy leading the orcs is Bellach.

The name of the guy leading the nazis is Belloq.

 

I don´t consider it a bad thing seeing as I quite like Indiana Jones but I am wondering why I haven´t seen anyone else comment on it :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].

yeah, it's a bizarre but awesome reference for aTolkien-themed game.  Some people commented on it in a thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/127059-race-to-the-forge/].

Ah right you are.

Never read the threads for quests I haven´t tried yet and that one has crept quite far down the list by now.

 

Used to get the packs within a week of release but lately I have been forced to wait for a month or more.

Ah well... c´est la vie

Tried it twice with a Galadriel, Haldir, Celeborn deck.

 

Lost the first one, mainly because all three of Nenya cards where on the last five of my deck  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]  , thus came out very late and I lost due to higfh threat. Apart from this the quest did not seem that difficult though.

 

Second attempt with same deck, Nenya came on fifth turn (even while I was exhausting Galadriel each turn to get an extra card) and from then on it was far easier. At a point 6 enemy cards pilled up on staging area but after Gildro with a Burning Brand, the Silvan defender character, Arwen and Orophin came in play, I managed to reduce them from turn to turn and eventually won the quest after destroying Bellach (or whatever his name). It took long though, some 14 turn if I remember well

 

The Silvan deck (the non Silvan cards were Galadriel Hero, Gildor and Arwen, all other allies were Silvan) played very well, especially the trick to return cards to your hand and trigger responses, did a lot of these.
