# [I WANT MORE TOKENS](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/)

As I do have only one coreset I often don't have enough resource tokens late in the game. Also in the third Hobbit quest I don't have enough progress tokens. So I wonder if its not possible for FFG to add a handful of "5x" tokens in one of their upcoming expansions. A lot of quests nowadays require 15+ tokens, and a "5x" token would make it easier to keep count of your current progress.

I know this is just a minor thing, but then this wish is very easy to fulfill.

I just use 8,10 and 20 sided dices, more convenient that handling 20+ tokens on a single hero/quest card.

 I could send you some left over tokens.

Actually, this is something that surprised me when I first got into the LCGs, that each token you have is only representative of one unit (of progress/wound/whatever), whereas in their boardgames they do provide tokens with +5 on them. At first it wasn't a problem as you didn't seem to need them, as you'd be dead long before you had need of more than 5 wound markers, but as the game has evolved, and specifically with quests being long rambles with lots of progress needed, I think I'd like to see something like this addressed, too!

yes i agree- on quest that have a large amount of progress and locations with the same it can be problem, same if you have steward of gondor and some other resource machine and dont spend any for a while

i usually use progress for resources as i cant use damage and either one for locations as i wont get mixed up there

I use only damage tokens from lotr core set. For progress and resources much more easy and better use 6 roll dices. If you have10 or more progress tokens you must to count them every time but with dices you can see how many of them in one look. This make game more faster.

In my opinion 3 kind of different tokens Progress, damage and resources is just waist of time. Dices more easy, quickly and effective.

 In addition to di, you can buy wooden/plastic tokens either from FFG or other sources. They're not as pretty, as they're blank, but they are weightier and you can buy as many as you need.

Another thing they could add to that pack is the new "turn counter" token.  I end up using damage tokens to count my turns now, but if I was going to buy a new box I think I would want say 20 turn counters, or a turn counting dial or something.

This. I wonder if they could add some of this stuff into a future deluxe box or something eventually. Just some value 5's of all 3 different tokens, and a turn counter dial that's different from the threat dials, as to not confuse them.

Another good thing would be a few of a different colored 'generic' token, to use with stuff like Keeping Count. Basically, cards that need tokens placed on them for abilities. It says to use resource tokens I think, but there's been many times in the middle of a tense game where things are messy or get bumped and we have to remember exactly how many were keeping count tokens and how many were resources on a friend's Hero.

Ok, I could use dice. Or ugly empty tokens. But since it was FFG who had the idea to support their players with these awesome tokens (and I really love those progress tokens!) , they're also responsible to provide us with more tokens. It's like selling a poker case with not enough chips in it. And it's really only a little effort for FFG, but a great reward for mankind. Which appareantly means that…

I STILL WANT MORE TOKENS!

I don't think many will like this suggestion (and I agree that some fives or more singles may be nice in APs or Deluxe Expansions, or as an accessory), but we could WRITE (I can see the cringing) a 5 or 3 on one side of the token.

I made some stickers and stick them on my tokens to make counting easier.

They really could put one sheet of stickers in an AP or DP to add those 3s, 5s, or 10s to one side of several tokens. I'd be happy with that. Those "s" after the numbers make me think of 52, 70, and 140, anyone with me on that?

Vedui'

 

I've been a "lurker" in this forum for over 2 years, and currently LotR LCG is my #1 favorite game with over 800 games registered under my belt!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

After so many plays and teaching many new players my tokens got pretty worn out and i've been searching for a solution, a long search brought me here, hence the threat necromancy for wich i appologise for.

 

I'm still waiting for Team Covenant to make some sweet acrylic tokens for LotR, and on Azogames (http://www.azogames.com/ [http://www.azogames.com/]) the site is still under construction, and i don't think they are "ready" yet.

 

So i decided to go for the "sticker" ideia suggested earlier in this thread, hence my post requesting for help. 

What i need is something like this: http://www.choppic.com/blog/custom-token-stickers/ [http://www.choppic.com/blog/custom-token-stickers/]

However since my tokens are too worn out on both sides to the point of being almost unable to tell progress tokens apart from resource tokens, i would prefer to have tokens with the "normal" picture on one side (representing 1 unit) and the 5 on the other side just like in the stickers link above. 

 

So basically the same as the picture on the link, except instead of 5/10 i want 1/5 (and the 1 side without any number on them)

 

Anyone nice and willing to help me out?  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Thank you very much in advance.

## 27 [booored on January 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1390566)

I use dice and have 3 cores. If you pay postage I'm happy to send you a pile.

## 28 [jormungandr on January 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1390610)

that's very cool, choppic! I just use, 'off' tokens to represent 5x, say a recource token on a quest means 5 progress, a progress on a character means 5 wounds, etc.

## 29 [Strilar on January 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1391768)

Like Jormungandr i also use 'off' tokens to represent 5x, like a resource on quest meaning 5 progress but i like the stickers ideia and it's nice to have a better visual aid of how many tokens we have at one place. 

 

I really like acrylic tokens (a friend has the team convenant Netrunner tokens and they are pretty useful) and the ones at http://www.azogames.com/ [http://www.azogames.com/] are very cool, useful and good looking. You can see them all in this picture: 

http://boardgamegeek.com/image/2055563/dergidan [http://boardgamegeek.com/image/2055563/dergidan]

 

I might consider Booored's offer but if i eventually manage to get a hand on acrylic tokens i would prefer those, so for now i would prefer to stick to the stickers (no pun intended), to give a new life to my already worn out tokens, i can't find any picture of the LotR tokens so i don't know how Choppic actually made those (and he doesn't seem to post around here anymore). 

 

I see a lot of skilled people with picture making/editing skills around here so was hoping someone could pick on Choppic's ideia and make a new version for stickers, with 1 and 5 sides. Would be even cooler if the colors were somewhat different, like golden-colored resources for '5' instead of the silver ones for 1 or maybe dirt/mud colored progress token footprints instead of green, etc, just an ideia.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

So i ask again, anyone willing and able to give this one a go? I would be thankful.

 

Namaarie

I simply use dice. More practical and easier to use.

Perfect place for these tokens would be in a core set expansion. Along with some new player cards designed specifically for 3-4 player (although still working in 1 and 2) and the missing core-set cards to get 3 of each.

> I simply use dice. More practical and easier to use.

I also do this. Yellow dice for resources/progress and black dice for damage or time counters. I use the resource tokens that come with the core set to indicate whether characters are ready or exhausted. Works well enough!

I also use this really neat replica of the one ring I was given a year or so ago as the first player token, I simply place it on the inner black knob of the threat trackers.

Hello again! 

 

I understand that many people use dice and prefer to use them, i also use dice in a few games but this topic is called "i want more tokens" for a reason...  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  Saying that you prefer to use dice won't help me in what i'm looking for, wich is a similar version to this: http://www.choppic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tokens.jpg [http://www.choppic.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/tokens.jpg]

 

I want 1 & 5 instead of 5 & 10, if anyone is skilled enough it would be even cooler if the "5" were in a different color, like golden resource tokens somewhat like this: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Talisman/fate-tokens.png [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Talisman/fate-tokens.png]

 

The different color is not required, that would just be a bonus. I just want stickers to put on both sides of my already worn-out cardboard tokens... with so many image-editing artists around here, is there a kind soul that will take a step forward to help?

 

Leptokurt said my thoughts exactly previously in this thread, so i'll quote him here:  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

There is plenty of chips in the sets. The core set is designed for people to buy more than one copy. That is way when you buy one you have what seams to be to few tokens. FFG expects you to buy at least two.

Maybe i can just do it myself with paint or something, but i can't seem to find any usable pictures of the tokens.

 

Does anyone know where did "Choppic" get the progress/resource/wound token pictures so he could put a "5" or "10" on top of them?

 

Thank you once again in advance to anyone who helps me get those sticker pictures for my tokens.

Hi Joezim  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

I want to have stickers to put on both sides of my tokens, one should just be the normal token picture (representing 1 unit) and the other should be a 5 token. If anyone is willing to put extra effort in it, then the 5 side could be a different color to make it easier to see across the table. Does that make sense?

Really cool thanks!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]  That's what i had in mind! At last my prayers have been answered heheh!

 

The golden "5 token" for resources looks perfect! The 5-Wound and 5-Progress look a bit weird though (the progress one looks like it's a "new" real token, the other two look kinda like someone just sprayed red/green paint over them).

 

However I have ideia how to make them more cool looking, maybe playing with colors a bit i guess... got any ideas?  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Yea, I wasn't sure how you'd like the damage or progress tokens. I wasn't sure how I felt about them myself. I could just add some kind of border to them. How about that?

Sorry for the delay answering Joezim.

 

What do you mean by adding some kind of border? Can you show me if it's not too much work?

 

I still don't know how to make the 5-progress and 5-wound token cooler, but they should look like "new" tokens, like the 5-Resources one.

 

I'm open to ideia and suggestions so feel free to do your own versions (lot's of creative artists in this forum).

 

One ideia would be to play with the color palete a bit, for example the progress has dark brown footprints on a light brown path with a bit of green grass on the sides, so maybe light brown footprints on a dark brown path? or a green grass path with brown dirt on the sides?

 

*edit* Another suggestion would be to have totally different colors, like golden instead of silver for resources.

Maybe something like this -> http://tinyurl.com/m9ayysv [http://tinyurl.com/m9ayysv]

Not sure about that one though because an asphalth road doesn't look very fitting for middle-earth, but at least it's a better color contrast and makes it a new/different token easier to tell it apart from the normal one.

 

As for the 5-wound, it looks like a day old wound, like the cut drew blood but has dryed out a little bit, how about trying to make the blood more "alive", some bright red like the cut was just recent? (No idea about the colors around it, but maybe make them darker so the bright red blood has a better contrast?)

 

If we can't come up with good-looking tokens, wich i doubt, we can always just put the 5 on top of the normal-looking tokens without messing with their colors (Excepto for the golden 5-resource, that one looks awesome  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

 

I really appreciate your assistance, this is something i was wishing and needing for months to make my LotR more cool looking and more practical too.

I find it interesting that you think the 5-resource token looks like a completely new token considering I did the same thing for that one as I did for the others: adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness. That's all: essentially just a color change.

 

Anyway, I tried a few variations: http://1drv.ms/1BV3TJK [http://1drv.ms/1BV3TJK]

 

That link goes to a shared folder. The top row of files are the Photoshop files, in case anybody wants to try doing something themselves. The PSD file matches the JPG file directly below it, so don't trust the PSD's thumbnail image because it might not reflect what it actually looks like. (These instructions are all for a widescreen desktop using the thumbnail view). I didn't make any changes to the resource tokens in any files since you seem to like those just fine.

 

- token_stickers is the first variation that I sent you

- token_stickers_border is an example of adding borders. I might be able to do better/more elaborate borders, but I was just demonstrating.

- token_stickers_original just has the original token images (except resource token)

- token_stickers_reverse is an example of essentially reversing the colors (red switch to black and light to dark). I only worked on the damage token so far.

- token_stickers_vivid is just an attempt to make the colors more vivid. Sadly, making brown vivid means making it red/orange, so that doesn't look so great to my eyes.

 

Let me know what direction you like and I'll see what I can do.

## 47 [Strilar on January 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1403719)

First of all, let me say that you are awesome, and that i'm really grateful for your help with this. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  That's one of the many reasons why i love the LotR online community so much.

 

I'll use the quote function to answer all points more appropriately:

 



> I find it interesting that you think the 5-resource token looks like a completely new token considering I did the same thing for that one as I did for the others: adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness. That's all: essentially just a color change.

Well... the 5 Resource looks like a "new token" because of two reasons, first one is the color change (golden resource instead of silver) the other is that while you made "just a color change", the Golden Resource is not just golden, like the original one it has spots of white making it look "shiny", even the border around it isn't just ALL golden. The 5-Wound and 5-Progress however, look like someone just sprayed red/green paint over them, on the 5-wound, the chainmail border is red, the "skin" is red and the wound is red, while on the 5-progress it's the same, green grass border, green path, green footprints, thus the 5-Resource looks like a "real" token while the others look obviously fake if that makes any sense.

The PSD file matches the JPG file directly below it, so don't trust the PSD's thumbnail image because it might not reflect what it actually looks like. (These instructions are all for a widescreen desktop using the thumbnail view). I didn't make any changes to the resource tokens in any files since you seem to like those just fine.

 Really cool, thanks!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Variations help to brew new ideias and to compare what looks better or worse, and maybe other forum members can input what they like most or give suggestions and yeah i'm happy with the resource tokens, can't think of how they can look even better.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I sent all of these to two of my friends who play LotR with me so they'll give me some input too wich i'll mention below.



> - token_stickers is the first variation that I sent you

Yup, that was a great start, thank you! Already discussed about this one above.

 



> - token_stickers_border is an example of adding borders. I might be able to do better/more elaborate borders, but I was just demonstrating.

I see what you mean now, the borders help make the tokens more distinct and one of my LotR players prefered this one, they look very plain with the solid colored border though (i know it's just a demonstration). I'm curious about what you have in mind for better/more elaborate borders. Maybe we could have "blood" on the wound token and leaves on the progress, but i would like to see your own ideias too.



> - token_stickers_original just has the original token images (except resource token)

Yup, this was exactly what i had in mind and needed when i made my first post, but after seeing that 5-resource i'm excited to see if we can make them even more cool-looking! If all else fails, i'll use these, but i'm sure we can come up with something.



> - token_stickers_reverse is an example of essentially reversing the colors (red switch to black and light to dark). I only worked on the damage token so far.

One of my players like this one for being "distinct" but i personally don't like the reversed-colored wound because we can hardly tell what picture it is, it doesn't even "look" like a wound with the colors switched, it's more like a dark blur or something. I'm curious about how the reverse-colored 5-progress would look though (green path, dirt footprints?)



> - token_stickers_vivid is just an attempt to make the colors more vivid. Sadly, making brown vivid means making it red/orange, so that doesn't look so great to my eyes.

I agree that the red/orange on the progress token doesn't look great, i do like the 5-wound though, wich is my favorite of these new versions, it looks distint enough from the 1-wound, and the wound looks more "alive", it still doesn't look perfect for some reason but i would still use this one i think.



> Let me know what direction you like and I'll see what I can do.

Finally, one of my friends gave some other suggestion, this time not just about the color scheme, but another way to make the 5-tokens look more distinct.

He made a basic sketch here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yddyxhug3ydyewl/token_stickers_vivid_DANY2.jpg?dl=0 [https://www.dropbox.com/s/yddyxhug3ydyewl/token_stickers_vivid_DANY2.jpg?dl=0]

In case you can't see it, basically his ideia is to have 3 "slash" wounds instead of 1 on the other token, to make it look like a claw or something ( /// ) and to have more footprints on the 5-progress, we can easily put 4 footprints instead of 2.

If possible i would like to hear other player's opinions and suggestions, and maybe they can make their own versions of LotR LCG tokens as well. Would be cool to discuss diferent ones.

In any case, good job with these and thank you once more for helping, i look forward to your new variations of the stickers pictures for the LotR tokens!

Awesome work.

 

I just want to point out that having a different colour for the ressource token strike it more than just having more saturation.

If you take time into account, after a lot of finger touching those and all, saturation may fade away, and only the difference in colour will strike. Sadly, same for the edges, it is the first thing that will be damaged.

My preference would go to reversed damage token and vivid progression token.

Ooh... I really like the idea of making more scratches/footprints. I'm going to try that one really quick for you all.

## 50 [joezim007 on January 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1404887)

Alright, you can follow the same link I posted before to see the new ones:

 

- token_stickers has been updated a bit to be closer to what I originally intended

- token_stickers_multiply is the new example with adding more scratches and footprints

- token_stickers_multiply_vivid is the same as the previous one, except I attempted to make the colors more vivid again. I think these colors work better than my last attempt to make them vivid, mostly because I cut out the different areas and applied the color adjustments only in the exact places I wanted to put them.

## 51 [joezim007 on January 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1404894)

Alright. I also renamed the files to get rid of the "token_stickers_" prefix. The first concept was renamed to "colorize" since it didn't have anything after the prefix.

 

Right now, my personal favorites are original (why mess with a good thing?), multiply (great concept to show that it should represent "more"), and multiply vivid (I'm still debating whether or not I prefer the "enhanced colors").

Wow! These are great! Good work man!

I think i like them all except the "reverse" 5-wound and the "vivid" 5-progress (the last one with the red floor), the "colorize" 5-progress looks much better now but i still don't like it "all green".

 

I agree with you that the "original" looks good enough (why mess with a good thing as you say), but the multiply was really a great ideia and i think they look great.

 

I personally prefer the "multiply vivid" though just because i like the ideia of the 5-token looking diferent both in picture and in color. The "vivid" color on the 5-wound doesn't look as good as the other ones (the 2nd and 7th, colorize and vivid i think?), can you make that one with the same color contrast? (darker skin makes a better contrast with bright fresh blood wound).

 

As for the 5-progress, i like the several footprints and the bright (kinda orange) floor, but like the wound, maybe a bit more contrast would make it even better? How about making the green grass darker (like in the colorize?) and keep the other colors as they are?

 

My friends agree that the "multiply vivid" looks the best (although they also like the other ones), so i think i'll use that version after the minor changes in color/contrast i mentioned above.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] 

 

These should be the last version requested before i finally print them in stickers and place them on my tokens (at least for me, feel free to keep making cool tokens if you like!)

## 53 [alogos on January 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1405795)

I'm hesitant about vivid versus original one.

I think as the ressource one is more vivid, I prefere the vivid ones... you should try making the ressource one less "shinier" ? for the multi original set...

Otherwise, I agree that the multiply progress should be a little bit darker.

The multi damage is more awesome than the multi path...

Alright, I added mva, which is multiple vivid with some adjustments per feedback. Here's the link again: http://1drv.ms/1BV3TJK [http://1drv.ms/1BV3TJK]

## 55 [alogos on January 14, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1406222)

Feels perfect for me.

## 56 [Strilar on January 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1406897)

Yup! I think it's perfect!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Final version for me!

 

I'll try to find some place to print them on "stickers" tomorrow and will post pictures later of my shiny new tokens!

## 57 [alogos on January 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1407277)

Also interested in place where you can print them on "stickers"... in France because customs are expensive :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] 

## 58 [joezim007 on January 15, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1407951)

I'm gonna go ahead and delete some of the extraneous attempts from that folder now. I removed the multiply_vivid files and renamed mva to multiply_vivid, so don't be confused. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

QUEST COMPLETED!!!

 

Hello, after commiting several posts to this thread, and Joezim007's constant fighting against the shadow of my demands, i'm happy to annouce that my "LotR Tokens Revival Quest" is completed!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I'll start by showing the poor victims:

BNtuim.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/673/BNtuim.jpg]

 

As you can see after many encounters over 800 registered games (and many "demo" games to teach it to new players) they have suffered a lot of damage. Besides over-usage, since i play a lot with 4 players and only have one Core Set i used to carry D10 dice along with the tokens to count player's threat, and learned too late that plastic dice and cardboard don't go well togheter.  :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

 

The wound tokens are still "usable" but as you can see it's hard to tell the difference between many progress and resource tokens:

WhFt8p.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/905/WhFt8p.jpg]

 

So after achieving the objective of getting good token pictures from Joezim, i found a good graphic shop, that would print them on stickers:

 

jEo8nd.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/538/jEo8nd.jpg]

 

They were already "cut" in round shape so all i had to do was to "peel" them off the main sheet and stick them to both sides of each token. 

 

Here's a close up for better quality:

 

oy09Ay.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/908/oy09Ay.jpg]

 

Sadly, the stickers were just a tiny bit larger than the tokens themselves, so it wasn't perfect, and in many cases you really can't tell. Still they look much better now than previously, as you can compare here:

 

RxvGeG.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/538/RxvGeG.jpg]

 

In the end, after peeling over 180 stickers and placing them on both sides of each token (each token with 1-unit and 5-unit sides) the deed was done and i still have plenty of extra stickers in case some get ruined in the future:

 

XRmxBJ.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/673/XRmxBJ.jpg]

 

And finally, here's a closer look of the new shiny tokens:

 

Resources:

Progess:

Wounds:

Qgi1BJ.jpg [http://imagizer.imageshack.us/v2/640x480q90/537/Qgi1BJ.jpg]

 

So even though it's not "perfect" (because of slightly larger stickers wich can be seen in the close up) i'm really happy about the final result, as you can tell by this long post!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Special thanks to Joezim007 once more and to the online LotR community as a whole for always being willing to help a player in need. This wednesday they'll be used for the first time as our quests through Middle-Earth continue.

 

Next quest: print-out all fan-made scenarios in existence... stay tuned!  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'm so glad that I could help you out. I'm curious to find out whether they are too big because the image was too big or if the printer prints at a different resolution density than a normal consumer printer because the post that had the original image stated that they were the right size and his photos showed that the stickers were actually slightly smaller than his tokens.

## 61 [Strilar on January 20, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1413494)

I think it was actually the printer's problem, not the file.

 

I gave them one token so they could measure it and make the stickers based on it's size, so the stickers would be already cut and ready to peel & use. I was very happy with that option because otherwise i would need to use some scisors to cut over 180 round tokens.

 

I guess they took the measure themselves based on the real token and should have made them slightly shorter to account for them to be "pasted" inside the surface of the token. Still it was a good job nonetheless despite them not being the perfect size.

## 62 [JasonRed3 on September 7, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=3463068)

Sorry for the thread necro...

 

I'm looking for some of the files referenced in here, but their links are long gone.

Does anyone have good high-res versions of the tokens?

## 63 [Gandalf_ on November 4, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=3523846)

Sorry for the rising this thread again. As the fellow member above, I am also interested in those files. None of the links work anymore. Anyone can help?
