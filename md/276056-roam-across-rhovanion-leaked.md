What do you think? Is it authentic? Does anyone know where it was leaked?

He also posted it on reddit where there seems to be a little more info on it...

Other info includes that the hero will bear the woodmen trait, "forming the foundation of an entire new type of deck", and that the quest involves going to the orc stronghold Gundabad and the heroes have an "uneasy alliance" with a goblin in search of his lost possessions.

Same here. There's only three cards currently with the woodman trait. I wonder if this pack will be filled with them like The Steward's Fear had with Outlands. I know nothing of the woodmen of middle earth so I have no idea who the hero could be. My guess is maybe another FFG created one.

The woodmen were just a group of Northmen living on the western edge of Mirkwood. They were akin to the Beornings, the Dale men, and the Rohirrim.

Loving the Saxon-ish warrior on the boxart. Huskarl as can be.
