# [Question on older Adventure Packs, are they out of print?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187126-question-on-older-adventure-packs-are-they-out-of-print/)

Hello,

I recently purchased the core set and am really enjoying playing the game. I have beatten The path thru Mirkwood twice, and a Journey down the Audin once. Currently beating my head against the wall that is Dol Goldur, but so far I'm enjoying getting my butt kicked. But I am also starting to look towards future expansions and have noticed that several of the older ones, like the Hunt for Gollum appear to be out of stock both on the Fantasy Flight Games store and other on online retailers. Are these out of print, or do the adventure packs come back in to stock periodically?

Thank you for your time.

They come back in stock periodically. FFG usually reprints the entire cycle at once, so, it could take a few months to have what you want available, but don't worry, these are constantly reprinted. It's just a question of time

Also, try Dol-Guldur with two players. It's extremely tough solo!

If you look on the "upcoming" section of FFGs website you will see the first full cycle of APs is at the printers for a reprint right now :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The whole Mirkwood cycle is being reprinted right now.  My guess is it will be available sometime at the end of the year or early next year.

Thank you for pointing out the website that shows the soon to be released packs.

Took a couple more cracks at Dol-Guldur, this time with my Brother, had one attempt where we made a bit more progress, but still brutal. Fun but brutal. I am very impressed with the folks that are able to beat this with just the core set. We are gonna tweak the decks abit and try agian.

Looking forward to expanding my card pool a little, (and really like the idea of tracking Gollum down).

Dol-Guldur is mostly a question of timing:

 

- you need to quest quick enough through stage 1 to regain control of the prisoner, otherwise it could be problematic (clearly this factor becomes less impacting with the increasing number of players); so if you go core, be sure to have Eowyn in the mix for a potential +6 willpower; and probably Legolas to gain bonus progress markers (arm him with 2 Blades of Gondolin and it's a +4 / round; if you give him Unexpected Courage, it's a +8 / round)

 

- you must have in the deck something allowing you to avoid location locks, so, Northern Tracker (who autokills the darn Tower Gate location)

 

- you need to have a way to control the Nazgul, so that you can engage him and kill him during stage 2 (stage 2 is delicate, but it's easier than Stage 1 because you control all your heroes: don't quest too strong - rushing to Stage 3 could be detrimental if the Nazgul is alive - but don't loose to much time). Thalin while questing, + Sneak Attacking Gandalf during Resource and playing him immediately afterwards means the Nazgul is dead. End of the story, in 6 resources only

 

- as soon as you enter Stage 3 with the Nazgul dead, play all the allies you can and powerquest to victory in just one round

 

Be patient; it looks nightmarish, but you can do it. It's a good quest to understand how to modify your deck to take care of the problems :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thalin will not trigger on the Nazgul, as it is not revealed by the encounter deck.

Good point. Still, even without Thalin, the idea is to get rid of the Nazgul as soon as possible. Don't keep in the staging area due to the +5 threat, don't keep it engaged with you or it could be messy...
