 I find it odd that the only actual weapon attachments we have seen so far are Dwarven Axe, Blade of Gondolin, and Burning Brand. Tolkien's world teems with unique items (armor, swords, bows, etc...) you guys think such things will eventually be on the way? I want to start pimping out my favorite heroes with awesome unique items! If anyone here used to play the Decipher LOTR CCG, you all know what I'm talking about. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'm sure stuff is coming. The restricted keyword isn't really a big factor yet but once we actually have several choices the decision of which two to put on will take some thought.

I think the fact that we have these Heroes that stand out and can be decked out in stuff almost begs for lots of attachments. It's just a matter of them coming out as the game grows. Might even get attachment heavy expansions of some kind, like an Armory Pack to increase the potency of Heroes. With a quest of course where you get to scavenge through a tomb or raid a stockpile.

This game is just getting started. We'll have piles of cards and decklists in a couple years.

 A good observation Marlow. I am so excited about what will be rolling out. I am such a LOTR nut (as I am sure you probably are as well) and I am extremely satisfied with this game thus far. The art is exceptional, play abilities continue to get more complex and awesome, and the quests are loads of fun. I look forward to one day getting "Gimli's Axe" or "Narsil" that only those characters can wield (finger's crossed) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]. Thanks for responding!

I too believe that a lot more attachments will appear, but they mustn't become too overwhelming.  My personal hope would be some protection against non-combat damage.  Insect repelant against those horrible Hammerhorns?  Only kidding but....nice.  Makeing these unique and/or restricted is a must.  Of course, these will make the game much easier, so I hope there will be more Treachery/Shadow cards to compensate.  A >50% damaged Hero who was limited to just 1 restricted item would hurt.  It would stop a virtually dead Gimli with Plate and Axe from charging around like a tank for too long.  Yes, there is plenty of lovely new stuff to bring out, BUT we also haven't seen all the horrible stuff mentioned in the books.  Exciting innit?  Cheers!

I have to disagree on that one. One of the things I disliked intensely about the decipher game was all those items that you could only play on one particular character. I'm all for having Narsil, The Arkenstone, Sting, the Book of Mazarbul etc., but would much prefer them to be playable on anyone with maybe a bonus if played on the 'appropriate' character (like Celebrian's Stone and its Aragorn-only additional benefit).

+1 to above, but still exited to see new weapons either way,

 

looking forward to see what a lorien bow on legolas could do, or stings special abilities

If it's the version of narsil (well, Anduril) from the films, then very few people are going to be able to weild it, cos it's so stupidly long. Aragorn has enough problems with it, never mind a dwarf or a Hobbit.

In MECCG, almost all the weapons were 'Warrior only', apart from Sting which was 'Hobbit only'. I'm happy to restrict weapon availability but would much prefer to this through traits rather than character names.

 What, Dunedain signals aren't cutting it for you? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]  The signals are pretty good.  I'm interested in seeing some more creatures, mainly horses.

## 10 [DurinIII on September 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52690-where-are-all-the-weapons/?do=findComment&comment=524452)

 Hahahah...yeah, I love the signals actually. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I just like the idea of having other bonuses that aren't necessarily "Dunedain." I mean, where are the Dwarf runes? All in good fun. Horses would be awesome! 

## 11 [Spirit Juggler on September 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52690-where-are-all-the-weapons/?do=findComment&comment=524460)

Part of the problem in Deciphers CCG with items for specific characters was that you had to hope both character and weapon came out of the draw deck. With this LCG you start with all your hero's in play so it's just a case of waiting for the weapon to come out. I reckon the weapons may well follow when they've got the hero's out. Have a unique one card weapon rather than a unique one card hero. 

## 12 [DurinIII on September 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52690-where-are-all-the-weapons/?do=findComment&comment=524512)

 I think you are on to something good there Spirit. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] You make an extremely good point; besides the characters you started with in play in the Decipher game it was always hard to pair up drawing a hero and his weapon at the same time. I would often be sitting with Theoden's sword in my hand for instance, just waiting to finally draw Theoden so I could play it. The point you make is a good one...the characters that you want to play "unique" weapons on will already be in play, so all you have to do is pop the weapon on him or her. 

To be fair, I like the option of playing any item on any character (with a bonus given to specific bearers; for instance Celebrian's Stone pumps up even more on Aragorn, or Dwarf Axe on a dwarf, however, what happens when they release Narsil and I am allowed to equip it to Legolas? That just seems weird to me really.  Unique items seem natural and they are not restricting in the broader sense if you accept the fact that in any deck certain cards are always going to be left out until another game; thus, if I am playing Aragorn in my fellowship, I will play my copy of Narsil; if Legolas, then I will play "Legolas's Bow," if Frodo/Bilbo then Sting...the list goes on indefinitely really. This is just one opinion. I like character specific unique items as an option; it stays true to the actual story.

I somewhat agree with this post. I also did not like the limitation that character specific cards added. I would also much prefer weapons (that besides having  realistic weight restrictions) had no limitations to who they could be carried by. Being used (for an effect) is different. Therefore as stated they can give an additional bonus to certain characters or traits.

I agree the game could use some more equipment. However, the attachments that do exist should be more restrictive. For example, you can have a hero with Protector of Lorien, Song of Whatever, Unexpected Courage...and have 0 restrictions. So, add a SoG and Citadel Plate and that hero is now a walking battle-tank that spits out mutli-colored resource tokens.

Maybe they should change the Attachment titles to something like Equipment(where any character can only have 1), and Title(a la Steward of Gondor, and limit that to 1 as well).

This would also encourage people to put more attachments on allies. As it is, I almost never put anything other than Born Aloft on allies(and by allies I mean Gandalf).

I see too much restriction is no good. Nothing to do with the Restricted keyword. Now, I would like to see the traits being played out though. Not only nations which we saw some of already. I like the idea that some attachments would be Warrior only. I myself have been thinking of an attachment Battle Ground, attach to a location, whilst this location is active, all Warrior characters get +1 Attack and +1 Defense.

It would be nice if FFG would center a large expansion around aspecific nation. I've been wondering what they will do woth the larger expansions for some time now. Center them around a nation? A race? Or a specific region?

I know a large Moria expansion would be cool! happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

## 17 [DurinIII on September 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52690-where-are-all-the-weapons/?do=findComment&comment=525155)

 I concur! I am also hoping a large Moria expansion will come out! However, I am also extremely biased in that direction as Moria inevitably means lots more dwarves...but hey, during this time of the story line the dwarves were doing more. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 18 [Vyron2 on September 9, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52690-where-are-all-the-weapons/?do=findComment&comment=526177)

 I think that we've pretty much seen the system that FFG is going to employ - it'll be a quest/region themed release!

Personally, I find this very good - it's like taking a trip to a certain region for a couple of months - be it Moria or Mirkwood (which I find VERY appealing so far, by the way - I mean, check out THE AWESOME artwork of all the groves, streams, riverlands, etc. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] WONDERFUL!)

 

Thus, we could be seeing a "Dwarf Expansion" - maybe Iron Hills/Withered Heath, Ire Rock whatever, or Moria themed with Rivendell and Lorien around (and again the Anduin awaits :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]) - or a ROHAN cycle, helping minimize Saruman's influence, before the movies...

 

as to the movie stuff: I know, I know, EVERYBODY just wants to play the movie scenes and scenarios: personally, I think that this - in some future - should be available, but it shouldn't be the main focus - I think it's MUCH more interesting to see all the other things and quests mentioned in the appendices, other lore, etc. and the characters struggling with little equipment.... I mean, it kind of DOESNT MAKE SENSE TO GIVE ARAGORN ANDURIL BEFORE it is reforged - and that would be in the book itself... but, we are in the period BETWEEN Bilbos departure and Frodo's unrest... 

to tell you the truth, I already feel kind of strange potentially running around with Thorin, Eowyn and let's say Frodo - I MEAN, REALLY GUYS? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

anyway, while I'm all for more equipment - and we'll get it - stay assured - I'm not for the UBER-equipping or questing - kind of defeats the purpose of the Ring War, if ALL is well in the jungle, even before the war starts :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] you get me? SOME consistency should be kept...

 haha :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

gotta say - and there we have it - a Moria expansion :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]))) ok, it was a kind of no-brainer...
