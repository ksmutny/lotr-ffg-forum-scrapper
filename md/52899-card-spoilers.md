I hope others can add to this thread and we can keep it going for any future releases.

I went ahead and bought a copy of the Game Trade Magazine #138 to see the Dead Marshes add on the back and to be able to share it with you all.

I posted pictures up on BGG under the Dead Marshes expansion page.

 

Enjoy!

Thanks for the spoilers! Extremely excited to see Borimir! Tactics is only getting stronger (though, sadly slower than the other colors it seems).
