Their have been a few threads on the best quests in the game, but none recently on Nightmare. NM has really reinvented the game for me, and I wanted to see which quests the community at large has most enjoyed.

I want to divide the quests into 3 categories, Best Improvement, Best Thematic, Best Artwork.

 

For Best Improvement quests, I want to list the 5 quests that I feel were rather lackluster originally but got exponentially better with the NM version.

 

Journey Down the Anduin: This is one of everybody's favorite quests but I was always annoyed with how easy the quest could be depending on the cards you drew, the NM definitely made the quest consistently difficult and forced you to cater to certain possibilities such as the 10 threat location and the return of the Hill Trolls.

Best card: Gladden Marshlands

 

Hunt For Gollum: This quest is not incredibly difficult but it changed it from a laughably easy trudge through Mirkwood. Now I enjoy searching for Gollum and find myself always worried about those Hawks and Wolves calling to the Hunters, great addition to the quest.

Best card:Hunting Warg

 

The Seventh Level: This is another fun quest but lacked real danger until the Goblin stacking came out in the NM version. I love how all the Goblins build off each other and you get overwhelmed by swarms of little meat eaters, finally some real tension.

Best card: Orc Taskmaster

 

Encounter at Amon Dun: I would play this quest frequently to test new decks and because I loved the theme, but it was a walk in the park. There was never real threat of losing, and those villagers didn't even seem to need our help. NM turned it into one of the most difficult quests in the game in my opinion. The villagers really get chopped apart like so much wood. Now it is an amazing quest

best card: Run for your Lives! 

 

Foundations of Stone: I always wanted to enjoy this quest, but the Nameless things were wimps...Until 2.0 that is where they become the demons we heard about in the book, monsters older and more frightening than the Balrog. I have yet to beat this one, but enjoy it every time.

Best card: Primeval thing, scary difficult

 

Most thematic

 

The Redhorn Gates: It's all snow and weather, the giants and Orcs look like they live on those mountains, the Blinding Blizzard and Snow effects work well mechanically.

Best card: Snow Giant, pain in the butt, throwing stones and all

 

Conflict at the Carrock: you feel as if you have stumbled into a troll lair with no one particularly happy to see you. The 2 headed troll and the assortment of little ones all remind me of a dysfunctional family out for blood.

Best card:Savage Hill troll, they like to gang up on you

 

Into Ithilien: They stripped away everything but the Harad and Archery, and it really comes to life. You feel as if your in a dark forest, and going to be ambushed any second. Best card, Savage Fray, switches it from battle to siege or vice versa and makes you feel very nervous knowing this could come out.

 

A Knife in the Dark: This quest was already top notch, but the new cards just make it so much more creepy. Those Nazgul are lurking around every corner!

Best card: Menacing Wraith, adds a few more intense enemies

 

Morgul Vale: The race is finally on, there is now a definite chance of the enemy escaping, and all the enemies keep pumping the Captains! 

Best card: Warrior of Nurn

 

Best artwork:

 

Assault on Osgiliath: The fight among the castle and fierceness of the enemy is captured very well.

Best card: Haradrim Warrior

 

Shadow & Flame: All grim and fiery.

Best card: Morgoth's Bidding, that guy is toast

 

The Dead Marshes: Dripping with mire and muck

Best card: The Mere of Dead faces, creepy location

 

Shadow of the Past: Just perfect, love the Nazgul

Khamul the Easterling, #1 favorite card for art
