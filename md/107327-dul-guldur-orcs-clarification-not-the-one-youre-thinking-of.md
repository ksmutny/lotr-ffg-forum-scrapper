# [Dul Guldur Orcs clarification (not the one you&#039;re thinking of)](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107327-dul-guldur-orcs-clarification-not-the-one-youre-thinking-of/)

## 1 [Pearls on May 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107327-dul-guldur-orcs-clarification-not-the-one-youre-thinking-of/?do=findComment&comment=1099917)

So I did try to google this for a little while and dig around the forums but I wasn't particularly successful.

 

Dul Guldur Orcs have a when revealed of: "The first player chooses 1 character currently committed to a quest. Deal 2 damage to that character." 

 

Does this mean any character, including any other players that might also be questing, or must it be a character the first player controls.  Typically the game clarifies with "you control" but in this case, I wanted to check.  

 

I'm sorry, It's a really dumb opening question for my first post on the forums :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

EDIT:  I can't even spell Dol Guldur.

I always played it as if it could be any character--- SO, sometimes the first player has 0 questing characters, but he still has to choose someone who belongs to another player.  Same for Black Uruks [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Black-Uruks-KD] from the Khazad-dum expansion. 

 

I don't have an official source to point to, I am just playing it to the letter of the card.  As you said: it doesn't specify "you control," so any character should be a possible target.

I've always interpreted it as any character belonging to any player as well.

That is my interpretation also..

 

Any (regardless the player controlling him) character questing can be chosen to take the damage

I've never interprated it like that but, yeah that makes more sense
