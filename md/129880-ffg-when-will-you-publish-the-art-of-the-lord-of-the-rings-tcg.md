I bought these books some time ago.

 

- The Art of A Song of Ice & Fire (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=121&esem=2 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=121&esem=2])

 

I'd love to see similar books like:

- The Art of The Lord of the Rings TCG

- The Art of Android Netrunner

- The Art of Star Wars TCG

- The Art of A Song of Ice & Fire Vol.III

 

Please FFG, sell us more books.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Star Wars and Lord of the Rings may well get this (as those will sell outside of the gamers to regular fans).

I suspect Art of Android Netrunner would not sell well enough to justify an art book.

I have a feeling there may be a license issue with LOTR, do they have rights to sell an art book? But as I've said many times before, I'd buy it without blinking - the art for the card game is gorgeous!

Android is massively more popular than this game, pretty sure a art book would sell very well. Not sure I understand art books, don't you have the art on the cards? Also google the artists to find large untouched versions of your fav card art

Artists usually legally prohibited from posting card art online for quite some time. Sometimes they don't post it at all.

Rubbish. Most of it is online.

Rubbish your arse. "Most" is a huge overstatement.

The point of an artbook is of course that images will be at least A4 size, collected together and printed on quality paper.

 

Would buy without blinking, I really really hope to see FFG do it.

> Android is massively more popular than this game, pretty sure a art book would sell very well.

 

Allow me to disagree on this point, an Android artbook will be appealing mostly to those who play Android, while a Lord of the Rings artbook will appeal everyone who's passionate about Tolkien's world, which means quite a wider audience. This said, I'm not so sure that if you have the rights to publish a game, then you have also the rights to publish artbooks, so, it could be more difficult than we expect.

 

But anyway, if there's a LotR or an Android artbook, I'll get them for sure :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah but only people that play this game would even know about it and this game is but a fraction of the popularity.

@other most artists have decent sized copies if you look.

Bumping this thread after randomly looking through a whole bunch of locations in the game and their fantastic art. Parth Galen, The Seat of Seeing, Rauros Falls, Doors of Durin, there are so so many amazing places in middle earth that are depicted in this game with astounding art. Honestly I would buy an art book simply filled with the location art without enemies or treacheries or anything else let alone one that includes everything. As much as there might not be that much demand for an art book I know that all the truly dedicated or obsessed players of this game would HAVE to own a copy if it existed.

Hmm, I'm not too sure about this. I do like most of the art in the game, but there are sometimes that it just doesn't do it for me. It kind of a hit and miss. Though recently the art has gotten mostly better, especially on locations, sometimes it can be too rushed IMO, or look strange.

 

But hey, as long as it's not Gladden Fields/Banks of the Anduin, I'm mostly fine with it.
