# [What&#039;s the possibility for a deluxe ex or AP bringing the &quot;old&quot; cards up to 3x?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54156-whats-the-possibility-for-a-deluxe-ex-or-ap-bringing-the-old-cards-up-to-3x/)

Since a lot of people have been "complaining" about the core set not having 3 x of all cards and I guess the same with the AP, I'm just curious to know something. Does anyone have experience from the other LCGs that FFG have "corrected" this later on? Like printing a deluxe expansion or an AP/asylum pack whatever it's called, with only "old" cards?

I myself doesn't have a great problem with this but I just got curious to know what have happened in the other LCGs :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

APs already have 3x of the player cards. For older LCGs, they seem to be re-printing them in this format when they run out of stock.

3x of a hero would be a waste of cards

Encounters are often 4x or more anyway

odds of a 3x core set/ a core set top-up. I'd say about zero. Bit of a shame, as LoTR has more redundancy than other core sets (i.e. if you buy a 3rd AGoT core set, you'll still be able to use 100 or so cards, 3rd LoTR core gives u about 12 useable cards.) but the discussion has been hasd before, and there's never been much sign of change.

Sounds like a good PoD candidate. Maybe it won't happen but still, a boy can dream right? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

FFG has stated that the odds are 0%.  As for PoD, you can't mix PoD cards with regular cards because of variance in card quality.  So, PoD only works when you print the whole of a deck, like in Osgilioth.

That's what card sleeves are for.

Selling a product the requires the consumer to sleeve their cards is a poor idea.  FFG has stated a policy on what types of products they will deliver through PoD. Unless we see a total policy reversal, selling cards from the core set as a PoD product isn't going to happen.

I don't think it will happen either, and I'm fine with that. My point was that if players want to use POD cards, then sleeves are a must. I'd hope to see player deck cards on POD as well as encounter decks.

I was hoping for some news on a "top-off" set that completed 3x of each core set card that was lacking. Since Khazad-Dum will have 3x of every player card and every AP has also done this, I think FFG realized that players were a little miffed at having to buy multiple core sets just for 3x of each player card.

Someone did the math on the forums at boardgamegeek.com that in order to get x3 of each player card for the core set it totaled to around 65 cards or so (I'm too lazy to do the math to confirm). While it's 5 more than the standard AP, I'm sure I wouldn't be alone that I would buy it if FFG would release a special AP to include those cards.

I would definitely buy it.  I still haven't been able to justify buying a second core set because of all the extra encounter cards that I'd get.  I also understand that some people like having extra encounter sets to have multiple quests ready, but I still can't justify it in my own mind.

Since there's a sufficient number of players willing to buy duplicates of the Core Set there's absolutely no incentive for FFG to release something like that.

Which is probably why they're not going to.

I agree and dissagree to that. I just saw 6 AP's in Call of Cthulhu, that's a whole cycle. The reason for these AP's is, quote:

"A standalone set of Asylum Packs for the Call of Cthulhu. Forgotten Lore features cards that have been previously printed and are now formatted in the 60-card Asylum Pack format that adds 3 copies each of 20 distinct cards to a player's collection. These cards have been updated to reflect the most current FAQ and errata (at the time of printing). These cards expand on the decks in the Call of Cthulhu Core Set, and allow players to customize and create decks of their own."

One of the reasons is to update the cards, yes, BUT apparently FFG think it's a good idea to make these AP's beside update their core sets. So no matter if you are fan enough to buy 3x core set or to buy the core set reprinted updates they also thought of the players that wouldn't go to that length.

Now CoC has been around way longer so there might be a bigger need for this in that game than LOTR. What I'm getting at is that there's absolutely precedence for doing the same thing in LOTR however maybe not in the near future :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but it could definitely happen :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I have no idea what you are talking about. There is no updated CoC Core Set with three copies of every card.

The reprints are APs which for LotR already include three copies of every player card.
