My guess is that they ran out of preview articles.  Khazad-dum is releasing even later than they expected.  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

The frustrating thing is that Redhorn Gate isn't even on the boat yet, so it seems like that won't get to shops until February at the earliest.  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
