Some nice player cards in there.  We haven't had a new eagle card in a while.

Nice that tactics can put progress on a location.

Hear, Hear! Funny that it was announced so shortly after being leaked, though. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Meneldor looking top-tier in a mono-tactics deck.

## 6 [Fingolfin Fate on May 23, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3345657)

I see Meneldor in my Beorn, Theodred, Hirgon Eagle deck. He has Sneak Attack written all over it. Placing 2 and 2 progress and questing for 2 is a great deal. More so if you play him again from hand next round (or with Hirgon).

I am so excited about the player cards in this cycle. I am just a bit worried that Dale is getting almost too much. It may be beyond Outlands level by pack no. 2. But I like them more so far, they feel fresh with a new play-style. The unique warrior can be another great deal with King of Dale, potentially costing less than the attachment (like Raiment of War) you attach to him.

Excited to see Woodmen. Not sure if they can get so much support, but it is a clever idea. Another way to draw cards with Haldan. And you get this new Woodmen's Path, you add Ancient Mathom and Elf-stone and you are almost set. It has been a while since I played Mathom or Stone, time to brush up.

I would like to see Flight of the Eagles having the Eagle trait. They are a bit afraid of it, maybe. I am yet to try the encounter player cards. I think Flight to the Sea is much better than the ranger (also because it has a bonus shadow effect and no surge). Eagle of the North may be great, but its when revealed is likely to be wasted often, I feel.

Wow.

The eagles are coming is almost certain to yield 3~4 cards drawn now. Return to eagles theme and use of core cards in deluxe set reinforce the notion that this the last proper cycle.

Well, I also get the idea. But of course, I am not sure.

As for the Eagles are Coming, we only got a single new card to work with, though I feel Meneldor is worth three copies in a deck despite being unique, his ability is just so good.

## 11 [Ywingscum on May 23, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3345934)

New woodsman hero and location attachment look awesome.  1 progress token to explore a location, that’s pretty powerful right there.  

Eagle and the Leadership ally both look pretty strong, not likely going in the same deck though.

## 12 [TacticsLandroval on May 23, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3345937)

Haven't had more than 1 eagle card since Mirkwood cycle. Now we have 3 in one pack. Would make sense to revisit the earliest archetypes in the last cycle (to me)

 

I think meneldor should cost the same or more than descendent of Thorondor. Progression rare in tactics sphere.

## 13 [GrandSpleen on May 23, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3345950)

Finally an Encounter keyword Eagle!  I wasn't expecting a bald eagle though, that surprised me.

And I would argue that Descendant should cost 3, so Melendor is about right.

People, we have no strong reason to think that this is the last cycle. Could be, for all I know, but none of the arguments posed here actually support that. A proper Rhovanion cycle with drakes, dragon-hoards and woodmen was long due to appear and should've appeared years ago. No reason to think this is the last cycle yet.

Also noteworthy I think is the fact that they are also creatures. And we all know who likes creatures...

Eagle is unique, so his cost is ok.

Also, I can already hear all the cursing regarding those encounter eagles getting discarded as shadow effects.

## 19 [donkler on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3346144)

Hold on, let me update my most anticipated card for the cycle:

Thranduil

New Dain Ironfoot

Spirit Aragorn

Woodman Pipe

I'm curious what that Wild Stallion does during the planning phase. Something to do with an ally...

The real question, now, is this:

Does Haldan actually make Power in the Earth worth it?

## 23 [Authraw on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3346397)

Power in the Earth deck confirmed?

Also - does Woodman's path breathe any new life into Lorien Guide (that is - guaranteed explore active location in 1 turn, regardless of questpoints or even succeeding while questing)? Or does the 3-cost still make it a less-than-ideal option?

I could see a use for it in 4-player games to counter location lock, especially if you have attachment recursion for Woodman's path.

## 25 [Fingolfin Fate on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3346588)

Descendant is a bit costly like many early cards. But he is not unique, and can still be a great card, especially with Sneak, Gwaihir (or Sneaky Gwaihir), Hirgon. Meneldor is unique, and I had been asking for him, costing 3 actually, as we had been missing a 3-cost Eagle. However, the ability has surpassed what I had been hoping for. Suddenly Tactics got an amazing location control (actually they had Arod before, but this is a different league).

## 26 [Fingolfin Fate on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3346589)

I was checking attachments for locations last night, and yes, Power in the Earth sprang to mind. I think Haldan is made for a Lore-Spirit deck, but I am not sure about Power. Would be great though, one of the weakest cards in the core set. Too bad Haldan's ability works only for active locations, otherwise Explorer's Almanac would be superb. As it is, Guarded Ceaselessly may be an option: you attach it to a location in the staging area, reduce its threat for a round, then travel, explore, draw. The cost of 0 is nice.

Yeah, with the Stallion also having the creature trait, I think only the third non-eagle card to do so, perhaps a new version of Radagast is indeed coming. Or they try to revive the old one, but I think that would be hard: he is playable but far from great, which is a shame for a wizard.

Power in the Earth doesn't have direct synergy with Haldan, since his abilities key off the active location and the attachment only matters in staging -- plus it is off-sphere for him.  However, if you're going to make it the active location eventually getting a card draw and exhaustion free questing might make it worth including, if just for the novelty of actually playing it.

## 29 [Fingolfin Fate on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3346798)

Yes, most of the options now matter only when the location is in the staging area, but that is not a problem. You use the benefits (little they may be in case of Power, etc.), and once you travel and explore, you reap the fruits of Haldan's ability.

I hope we get a lot of support for this, as for now though, I think it makes Elf-stone a very good option: more so in combo with Woodmen's Path (I gather it will have 1 questing point even with the Stone). Mathom is another good candidate, even though it is off-sphere. I still feel Spirit would fit Haldan well, unlike Leadership which would provide Ranger's Provision...

## 30 [Ywingscum on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3347108)

I’m not an experienced player, I still consider myself a noob.  But I’m thinking a Haldan location attachment deck with mono lore trap deck sounds interesting.

 

could it work? What 3 lore heroes would be best, how many attachments (location and trap) would make sense?

## 31 [Wandalf the Gizzard on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3347255)

Well, most decks don't seek to do multiple things, but it could work. You would want Damrod of course, and maybe Pippin or Mirlonde. You'd have to leave room for allies so you would have willpower, attack, defense, etc. And enough events to keep the deck rolling. So maybe twenty attachments? On the other hand, you could go for the extreme with two lore control decks. One location attachments, and one traps.

## 32 [Fingolfin Fate on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3347264)

Yes, I think they would in a way do the same things: you know Damrod is great for traps and card-draw, and Haldan for card-draw, too. I imagine for Haldan to be efficient, you want at least 12 attachments for locations (only a guess), and Damrod likes to have something like 14 traps, perhaps. You can do less, naturally, but I find it cool when you can rely on having traps pretty much every round.

So, I would not put those two together. I really feel like Spirit might be a good second sphere for Haldan. And maybe even Tactics because it seems Woodmen will not be great at defending.

## 33 [Fingolfin Fate on May 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276512-roam-across-rhovanion/?do=findComment&comment=3347266)

And yes, as the wizard says, could be interesting with traps and locations, you can always stretch the deck-building with two decks, as they do not have to do everything each.

I love auto-draw heroes like Pippin and Damrod.

Add on the fact that there's two separate abilities and Haldan is nothing but awesome in my book. Also, called it with Wiglaf! The guy doesn't just look like a huskarl, he even plays like one(Give him shiny things, and he works hard for you, etc). Curious to see how many non-restricted Item attachments Dale'll get, since Raiment of War is great for him.
