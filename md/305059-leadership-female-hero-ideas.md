So I had an interesting observation the other day, there arent any female heroes in Leadership. Plenty of FFG characters spread through the other three spheres and even the classic book characters appear in Spirt/Tactics, but currently we have not one leadership female character. So for fun what would you design one as? Who would she be?

 

Galadriel is a great leadership choice and another version of her would be interesting, especially one that focused on her magic and power. Dunedain could make for some interesting characters as well.

 

My thoughts:

 

Elena

Minstrel, Noble, Noldor

9 Threat

3 Willpower

1 Attack

1 Defense

3 Hitpoints

Response: After you play a card with a Song trait, ready a hero you control or add a resource to Elena's resource pool (limit once per round).

Setup: Search your deck for a Song card and add it to your hand.

 

 

Or

Giselle (or whatever generic name you want)

Dunedain, Warrior

8 Threat 

2 Willpower

3 Attack

1 Defense

3 Hitpoints

Ranged

Response; after Giselle participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, add one resource to her resource pool.

Starting with a song is a great ability and could totally open up another sphere not shared by your heroes. 

Also I think Amarthiul is a female Leadership Hero.  I play her? all the time and she's fantastic.

Nah, he's a dude. His backstory was written in the battle of carn dun rulesheet.

we're not getting any more leadership heroes. The spots are taken. We're getting a single tactics and spirit heroes, and the cardpool is over for now.

Yeah Amarthiul is a dude, cool dude but definitely a dude still haha.

 

And I imagine we aren't getting one now but after the break who knows. Plus Elena is in the JIME game which makes her a possibility if and when we get more.

I'm really sad we won't see Elena in the LCG, I love her theme and art and Songs are definitely a subarchetype that would love some support. If side quests and victory display got a special hero, Songs definitely should have gotten a hero.

Have hope! Anything is possible and our game isn't coming to an end as far as we know, just to a change

After seeing the JIME preview for their new expansion (that game is tempting me more and more haha) I think a female Dwarf would be a fun challenge as well. With that in mind here is my take on her:

 

Dis 

7 Threat

2 Willpower 

1 Attack

1 Defense

HP 3

Dwarf, Noble

Allies named Kili or Fili lose the ally card type and gain the hero card type. 

(Would have to be released alongside new Ally versions of her sons)

 

OR 

Action: Discard the top card of your deck to add one resource to Dis's resource pool (limit twice per round).

Excellent ideas @General_Grievous [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/183728-general_grievous/]! Indeed JiME looks more and more tempting, I just wish we could see these new characters in the LCG as well. But hey, if AGOT will have new independent releases, same could happen for this game, which would be incredible.

Thanks @Gizlivadi [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/185970-gizlivadi/], I definitely have hope, this game sells so much and is crazy popular as it is, especially for being almost a decade old haha.

@General_Grievous [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/183728-general_grievous/] and @Gizlivadi [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/185970-gizlivadi/]

Yea, I really don't know what a return after the hiatus in a way that is "something different" but "not a second edition" could possibly mean.  Something like large independent releases (a la GoT) would be most welcome.  There is certainly plenty of content that could be added to the game, even ignoring the endless possibilities of FFG-created characters/enemies/sites.  There are some mainstream heroes with only 1 Version (e.g. Thranduil, Celeborn, Galadriel, Samwise, Thorin, Beorn, etc.), some big characters with multiple hero versions and no ally version (e.g. Aragorn, Frodo, Eomer, Eowyn, Theoden, Dain, Thorin, Beregond, Brand, etc.), some characters with ally versions (in some cases two ally versions) and no hero version (e.g. Anborn, Eomund, Angbor, Grimbold, Orophin, etc.), some big-name items that are yet to have an appearance (e.g. Aiglos, Ringil, the Iron Crown, the Dragon-Helm, the White Tree's seeds/saplings, etc.), some allies that could be added (the Old Thrush, Goldberry, Bergil, Lobelia, etc.), and so much else. 

I suppose the biggest limitation is "where to take the quests / storyline," since most corners of Middle-Earth have been covered by the existing 9 Cycles.  Still, I think there's always room to go to other nooks and crannies (or simply revisit areas again, in new ways).  Player cards released independently in batches coupled with periodic Adventure Packs akin to the Wizard's Quest / Woodland Realm would have an easier go at this continued exploration of Middle-Earth without needing to set an entire cycle against a new backdrop.


Of course, another route they may go, if they draw from the Iron Crown Enterprises playbook, would be do a Cycle (or a few) where players play as the Minions of Sauron, and go around trying to thwart or subvert encounter decks full of the heroes and havens of Middle-Earth (possibly even with a way to pit Hero Decks against Minion Decks in the same quest... maybe?).  Alternatively, they could do cycles set during different time periods of Middle-Earth, drawing from the Simillarion and Appendices and such.  While thematically asynchronous, mechanically there is no reason the content could not be played with existing player cards.  Not sure how I'd feel about either of these sorts of re-imaginings, but it would certainly open up a treasure trove of new content for the designers.   And any new content would be welcomed over no new content.  Although, given everything recently happening with Asmodee/FFG and all the games coming to an end, I suppose it's also very possible the game just stops and never returns in any form, new or old.

I find it both funny and sad that whenever these threads pop up almost nobody mentions a character with a considerably larger amount of pages and dialogue than most of theThranduil/Angbor/Húrin crowd: Bergil. We have no card to represent him at all.

If it's any consolation, I did work him into my edit prior to seeing your reply :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]   

I remember him being a very good value hero in the old Middle-Earth CCG.

Well spoken @EBerling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/304352-eberling/], there is certainly tons of content left for player cards (haven't even got into player card locations yet (siege weapons, campfire, shelter, Elven camp, Rohan warhorse stable, etc...) and all the heroes and allies you mentioned too (I want a friendly stone giant that Gandalf referenced in the Hobbit, as well as Huorns that get placed into the staging area and deal a damage/attack enemies there).

But your right that most locations have been explored but there is certainly still room for new content either in existing places or in other nooks and crannies. Actually this gives me a great idea for another topic.
