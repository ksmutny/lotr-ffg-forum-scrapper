I'm new to the game. I don't understand how you determine how many resource tokens each hero starts with before the game begins! Please help-I'm stuck.

one.  did you get a core set?  gotta read that manual bro, page 30.

Actually each hero starts with zero resource tokens before the game begins as outlined in the setup on page 10.

Each hero gets his first resource at phase 1 during the first round. This is an important distinction as it means you can´t use resources to counter any of the encounter cards during setup (though hero abilities like Eleanor´s treachery countering can still be used). Gotta read that manual more careful if you wanna pretend that you know it… bro

  DOH, I always overlook that.  Disregard my answer and go with this one!    Why can we not edit our own posts?

Also, if you are new to the game you might want to try Easy mode. You can find out more here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4165 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4165] In that mode your heroes do start with one resource each so that when you collect the first time you have 2 resources on each hero. It makes the game more fun while you get the hang of it.
