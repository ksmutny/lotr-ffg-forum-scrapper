seriously. i have played multiple times with each sphere. ending in my demise every time.

well alright i can't say i always die. oh no locationed to death is no longer a threat it is getting any sort of questing done at all. this sounds like a complaint, but i promise i'm not complaining, i'm having fun with the new quest and seeing some interesting ideas form in my head on some deck building.

i was wondering though has anyone had any success with beating this solo single sphere?

is there any hope of getting any ground unless you customize the deck?

my answer so far is no. it seems like you have to customize. i even played a 2 player game it went a little better but ended due to having 3 enemies on both sides we didn't even have a chance to help each other also resources were way low. my wife is my 2nd player in this game and it really made her mad, i admit it can be frustrating especially endable you are going to lose and all you are doing is hold on and wait for hope and it doesn't come.

well i'm going to give this some more tries i would like to beat it solo with a single sphere. hope to hear if there has been any success at this

I can't help you on this one.

I use built deck, and the only one I've used to play solo is a Lore/Leadership deck using Denethor / Bilbo / Beravor, but using the new Song of Kings to play Steward of Gondor, Sneak Attack, Ever Vigilant and Dunedain Mark.

The locations aren't too bad when playing Lore with the new Strider's Path. You can put the worst lands directly active, bypassing any bad travel cost.

The main threat I found from the quest deck is still the Hunter of Mordor... there's almost always a clue or two, making them very threatening...

i played a few more games and had a bit of luck. using leadership sphere. came very close. i think there is some light at the end of the tunnel on this one.

my first plays i had i didn't do to well at all with leadership. i must have done something wrong because i'm getting close every time now.

 i have had a lot of luck solo-ing with Dunhere, Eowyn, and Theodred using "song of kings". i only have the one core set and have, basically, thrown almost all of my spirit and tactics cards in the deck to get it to 50 total. i can beat it 75% of the time (10% of the time, easily).
