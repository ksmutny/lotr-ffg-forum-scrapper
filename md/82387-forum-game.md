so with talk of dead forums about…i know this is nothing new, but i thought id try to inject a little activity…..with a word game. this thread is just to see if there is interest. if there is ill go ahead with it, if not then no bother….its not everyones idea of something to do

the word game i had in mind is the following (cant remember the name sorry)…i had the game about a year ago on here

example

my clue = meteorology head

answer = weathertop

clues must be tolkien related

any takers?

Sure, I play but I foresee I shall suck my socks off at this. And I'll probably have to think hard to make a riddle.

## 9 [legolas18 on April 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=785277)

the first part is borrow i'm guessing, and then that makes me want to say "Barrow-Wight", but then the "Lake" part keeps throwing me off. Hmm…

Ohhh! Mere! Of course. I kept trying to think of it too technically, like "Borrow" and something else would form an actual word, not just sound like a word. But I see now.

Moments ago, I finally could think of one, I was going to ask it even though I had never guessed any, I wouldn't have asked any otherwise I feared…

I'll make a wild guess -- how about Grimbeorn?

 

bjorn being a word for "bear," but I can't get "famous" for "grim"…. so, wild guess!

## 25 [Samwise Gamgee on April 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=786015)

Good going overall, including the yoda crap, I mean crab. I had a laugh. And I think Bombadil is correct. And merging the threads, it were the orcs who first deviced the weapons of mass destruction.

Could it be Shadow and Flame?  Or the Balrog?  I'm think this because when I'm thinking of Flame/Fire I think of smoke and maybe would it be like getting tears from getting smoke in your eyes?  ehh I'm  probably wrong.

I'll keep it going, in case I was correct:

Name-fellow with a pugilist

No. Clue: name-fellow is kind of an obscure word, it means sharing a name.

Is there any more to the clue?? Because if the clue was "Sharing a name with a pugilist," then the only guess I have is something like… Warrior, but that's too generic.

I think it's fair to wrap up my riddle and move on. It was a bit obscure in hind-sight (and deceptively literal):

 

Something that shares a name with a (fictional) boxer (pugilist): Balrog

Balrog was a boxer in Street Fighter games

Sorry guys, haha

Barrow-downs?

 

If that's correct, I had to work that one backwards… lol.  "Down" was pretty straight forward…  I didn't really notice the minus symbol there for a while… so I just kept trying to think of "greatest inventions"… could really only think of writing and wheel… Oddly barrow-downs was the first thing that popped into my noggin with down… just couldn't really see how the barrow fit until I realized that it was a minus sign and that the "subtraction" was the first part of the word, not the last…

My turn?

I was hoping it wouldn't be a dead giveaway… but perhaps a more specific/altered clue is in order!

 

A "friend who weeps" reveals much about who they are.  And about who you are.

Wow… let's see how many clues I'll keep adding before someone finally cracks this one!  (I have a feeling this addition may give enough to do it):

A "friend who weeps" reveals much about who they are. And about who you are.  But take caution, lest your deep connection leave you burnt.

 

PS… I DO love the 1st Age material… but this answer spans multiple ages (a small clue in itself)…

A bit more perhaps?

 

A " FRIEND IN WEEPING" reveals much about who they are. And about who you are. But take caution, lest your deep connection leave you burnt.  But if your bond be true, there is no distance that can keep you separated.

## 127 [Mr Coffee on May 2, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=791318)

That's a pretty good insight with the "separation" concept there CJ!  But still not on target…

More info:

1) Not a person or place.

2) Single word answer.  If you replace the bolded words below with this single word, the entire segment will make complete sense.  And be instantly recognizable in a couple scenes from the Ring cycle.

3) Originated in Valinor.

 

A FRIEND IN WEEPING reveals much about who they are. And about who you are. But take caution, lest your deep connection leave you burnt. But if your bond be true, there is no distance that can keep you separated.

Hope that helps!

Not quite.  Although the "answer" does have a certain relationship to light.  Darkness and shadow would shroud the answer.

The funny thing is that I feel like I'm all but giving the answer away with these last few hints… but it's interesting to sit here and realize how simple things appear when you already KNOW what the answer is… lol.

I really think you will enjoy how I crafted the phrasing of my main clue when the answer finally pops out!  Conversely, you may very well sail across the pond and beat me with a tire iron… lol

argh….this is so frustrating cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]….fortunatly i dont have access to a boat (though my crab army may be on its way to you…)

how about death? that seems to read nicely to me…(i mean the answer is death, i was only joking about my crab army…(its far too small anyways..))

Nazgul?

 

It is not a person. but…..

## 134 [Mr Coffee on May 2, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=791335)

Not death or a Nazgul… though this was a corruptive force, it was not so by nature.

Not only does the word replace "FRIEND IN WEEPING" in the below statements, but FREIND IN WEEPING can be reworked as a play on words/syllables for the answer.  Perhaps this will help?

Friend + In + Weeping

Not sure I can do much more than that to give the answer away!!!

 

A FRIEND IN WEEPING reveals much about who one is. And about who you are. But take caution, lest your deep connection leave you burnt. But if your bond be true, there is no distance that can keep you separated.

"Friend" (pal) "in/with" (in/an) "Sorrow/Weeping" (tear/tir)

… and replacing those words in the statement hopefully make sense now!

"A Palantir reveals much about who one is. And about who you are. But take caution, lest your deep connection leave you burnt (was thinking of the palantír of Anárion here, and how the hands of Denethor seemed "burned" into it after his madness). But if your bond be true, there is no distance that can keep you separated (just referring to the general communication ability across great distances, and the need to possess great willpower to use them during the War of the Ring)."

They were items crafted in Valinor by the Noldor.  I had mentioned that "Darkness and shadow would shroud (them)".  Sauron possibly used this "shrouding" technique in his manipulation of the images that Saruman and Denethor saw, contributing to the corruption of one and driving the other to his madness… (I think I had mentioned something about them not being corruptive in nature, but being used for that purpose at some point)

You were equally close with that guess, as the Palantiri were possibly crafted by Feanor as well, but definitely of Noldor/Valinor origin…

 

Since CN is passing, might I throw out another one?  Much simpler this time, I think!

I'm getting the Uncle Buck reference… I have a hard time getting the whole + and - clues though when they pop up on here…  I was decent at math.  But like everyone else, I hate "word problems"… lol

I guess I'm not tracking what the reference to the "second clue" is supposed to be.  I think I understand that we're to be removing the word "buck" to get to the final answer…

## 148 [richsabre on May 5, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=792293)

youre right on uncle buck

i probably wrote the clue a bit rubbish.

so, the answer is 2 words. the first word, is what you become when you take too much of the first part of the 2nd word. the 2nd part of the 2nd word is related to  uncle buck (though not literally related as in its his nephew or whatever)

Still had to do some dancing around this one… lol.  But I think I got it….

Meriadoc Brandybuck?

I was thinking "drunk" + something that I had to take the word "buck" AWAY from (you had me confused with that - because I think you had used it to signify removing a part of a word before)… lol.  My first two thoughts were initially Buckleberry Ferry or something with Brandybuck…  just couldn't see how any of them connected to being drunk… so then got hung up over the Brandy part and stuck on Branywine….  I've always been more fond of the actual names Tolkien gave his characters, so eventually just kept thinking Meriadoc over and over (I love the sound of Meriadoc and Peregrin much better than Merry and Pippin)….  Finally, "Merry" just kinda slapped me in the face… lol

## 151 [Mr Coffee on May 5, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=792323)

Assuming that it's correct (put me in check if I'm not, Rich), here is my next offering:

 

If one can stomach the presence of spirits, you can delve the depths of the Great Fortress.

## 152 [richsabre on May 5, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=792334)

If one can stomach the presence of spirits, you can delve the depths of the Great Fortress in the towers of azure.

1) It's a location.

2)  What color is azure?

3)  The answer is a single word based on the bolded words in the clue.

## 156 [legolas18 on May 15, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=795773)

…. Nothing's ringing a bell… I got that it's a place based on those two words, and azure is a type of blue… Anyone else have a guess?

## 157 [Mr Coffee on May 20, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82387-forum-game/?do=findComment&comment=797199)

Wow… I wasn't expecting this one to be as tough…. Let's go First-Age scholars (there's a minor clue itself)…

Some updated/altered clues then:

 

"If one can stomach the presence of a spirit, you can delve the depths of the Great Fortress in the towers of azure."

 

1) It's a location.

2) What color is azure?

3) The answer is a single word based on the bolded words in the clue (stomach + spirit).

4) The  Dwarves would be familiar with this Ered Luin location.

YES!             cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]

 

"If one can stomach the presence of a spirit, you can delve the depths of the Great Fortress in the towers of azure."

 

I thought I included a lot that would lead right to Belegost, beyond the stomach = belly = bele, spirit = ghost = gost bit… 

1)  Belegost is the Sindarin name meaning "Great Fortress" (included in the clue directly.

2)  Towers of Azure is, of course, a reference to the Blue Mountains  (Belegost was one of two dwarven kindgoms located there prior to the breaking of the world, Nogrod being the other).

3)  I had hoped that "delving the depths" would be a giveaway for the dwarven penchant for digging into deep places

4)  And the "presence of spirits" was a very loose attempt to reference the fact that it (Belegost) was a now-destroyed location

 

So, well done, Raven! 

 

(Rich, you were spot on with the Blue Mountains, of course… was just trying to get a specific location in them…)
