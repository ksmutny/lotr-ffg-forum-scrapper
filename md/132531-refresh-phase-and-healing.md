I read somewhere that a healing effect like Daughter of Nimrodel can be activated in the refresh phase after she's readied, and because its the refresh phase it'll ready again. I assume this is wrong as the action window would be after characters ready.

Yeah that's wrong and silly, using Daughter during the refresh phase would lead to her being exhausted for the entire following turn.

It is however safer to use her (and Warden) during for example the end of the combat phase rather than during planning so that nasty treacheries/shadow effects etc that target exhausted characters cannot effect them. This way you also ready them almost immediately after using their ability leaving them ready for when it matters or for an emergency during staging etc.

You assume correctly that it is wrong; characters only ready once during the refresh phase. Otherwise the play limitation on a card like "peace, and thought" would be much more lenient.

You didn't do enough quest with nasty effect that comes "at the end of the turn" like:

It's all about timing...

Sorry you misunderstand, I just meant whoever was saying she will ready a second time after use during the refresh phase is wrong and being silly, timing is indeed everything! In some quests you pretty much have to use healers during staging rather than after questing or after combat or your heroes will perish, at other times (most of the time really) it is safer to save healing for later in the turn to protect your healers from nasty effects.

There is no action-window to use healers during staging, as I understand it. Unless, for instance, an enemy makes an attack, at which point there are action-windows of the normal enemy-attack framework.
