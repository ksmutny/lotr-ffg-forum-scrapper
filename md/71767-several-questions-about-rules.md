1.  In quest phase if an encounter creature card with "when revealed" ability,  is killed when revealed(like by Thorin's special ability). Is the "  when revealed" ability still triggered?

2. At the start of the game, when a quest card revealed and it shows us to reveal an encounter card:

a. If this card is a creature/land, we put it in staging area, do we still trigger their abilities(like "surge")?

b. If this card is a trap, do we trigger its ability (like "damage to all players")

3. Is a hero card also a player card?

4. Is a quest card with quest tokens requirement also a location card?

 

Thank you.

It's worth mentioning that when a treachery card ("trap") is revealed during the start of the game, if one of your heroes is Eleanor, you can use her Response to cancel the treachery.

Thank you. But Eleanor only replace the card so sometimes it might make the situation even worse…

 And my question is at the start of the game, a 'when revealed' ability may not be triggered cause its not the 'quest phase'??

When Revealed effects would be triggered during setup, unless the effect specifies that it is only triggered in the quest phase.
