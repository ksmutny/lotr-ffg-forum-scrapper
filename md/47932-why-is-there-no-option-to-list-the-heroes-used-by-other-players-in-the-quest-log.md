This would seem like something useful to add into the log.  I enjoy looking at the community stats.  Surprised not many other people use Beravor 0 decent stats and with the exhaust to unexhaust attachment becomes a card drawing machine.

I agree-out of the people i've played this game against, I'm the only with a FFG online account, and the others aren't likely to get one. So my Quest logs only really give half (or sometimes a quarter) of the whole story.

This was my main concern as well. Hope they read this and add that, then I'll start using it.

We use her, of course, she is very good. And as much as I love the character of Bilbo, his lcg version does not seem to compare well to this newly-created chick.
