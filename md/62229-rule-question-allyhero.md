# [Rule Question: Ally/hero](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62229-rule-question-allyhero/)

## 1 [laiyna on March 23, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62229-rule-question-allyhero/?do=findComment&comment=609288)

At times, I see: Any Hero, also I See: Any Ally

Can I play Any Hero on any character?

Can I play Any Ally on any character?

And if both questions are no, how can I recognize then the cards that can be played on any of my characters (so Hero and Allies).

 

thanks,

 

Laiyna

hi

any hero = just heros

any ally = just allies

any character= both (but not enemies)

I highly recommend reading the core set rule book based on those questions.  And I'm not trying to be disrespectful, but there is a lot more that is cleared up just by reading that rule book.

You should be able to find a lot of answers from several of the links provided on the Support page: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4]

Hope it helps!
