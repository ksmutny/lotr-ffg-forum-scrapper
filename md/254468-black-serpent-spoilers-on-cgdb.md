Just thought I'd let you guys the spoilers are up. What do you think of the new cards?

Fastred might make me give staging area Rohan an other try.

I First read the text of Cair Andros Defender and got excited. Saw the cost and was disappointed. No way you play It outside of mono tactics and even there...

Dunedain Pipe could be really great. Relyable, repeatable cycling? It's like a Slower Daeron's runes. And not unique! The card im excited about the most.

I think I only like the neutral cards from this cycle.

Fastred's odd, in that usually the last thing I want to do with an enemy I've already defended against is put them back in the staging area.  With that said, with enemies weak enough for Dunhere to knock off, it makes a nice repeatable threat-reduction combo, and at 3/3 he's got reasonable hero defense potential.

Song of Hope and Burst into Song are previously spoiled, I like Song of Hope's conversion of resources into willpower at need, but Burst into Song needs a lot of Songs in play to justify its 2 cost for a one-time event.

Old Toby had been spoiled before, but it looks a lot better with Dunedain pipe -- not unique, can attach to a character, provides repeated card cycling.  Very useful!

Rally the West and Fearless Scout are previously spoiled.  Scout is the least useful trait awarded yet; Rally the West's effect can be powerful.

Oath of Eorl is a powerful but expensive effect and previously spoiled.  The new Defender of Cair Andros is great when you get to 40 threat, but is expensive.  I'm currently testing a "Dori and the Damage" fellowship that pairs an Argalad deck with mono-tactics, and it would fit in beautifully there.

No neutral card so this is one player card short of normal.  Which AP has/had the extra player card?

You missed Southron Refugee.

I think the defender dude is overpriced for someone who starts pulling his weight at the 40 threat.

I did miss Southron Refugee.  That's a key card for a Harad deck.

DoCA is a stinker imo.  The other cards can work or be made to work.  Nothing mind blowing though.

Which card set is added from the box?  I can't make it out.

## 10 [dalestephenson on July 18, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2886766)

At 30 threat DoCA is a 3/3 defender with warrior trait.  The only 3+ defense Tactics allies are the great-but-fragile Defender of Rammas, the fragile and continuing-expense Winged Guardian, Beorn (3 def, unique, 6 cost), and Ceorl (3 def, unique, 4 cost).  As long as you have cards to burn, Longbeard Sentry can give you 3/3 defense for 3 cost.  Eagle of the Misty Mountains can grow from 2 defense into higher realms, but is also 4-cost.  And that's it.  So at 30 threat DoCA is slightly overpriced, but not by much -- there aren't a lot of solid ally defenders who can also take a hit in tactics.

And when you hit 40 threat, DoCA is a 4/3 defender that deals damage, and I think that's absolutely worth 4.  So if you regularly find yourself in Valour territory with double tactics, I think it's a usable card.  However, I think it's a shame he lacks sentinel, unlike his cheaper competition.

The real shame is that they cap his defense at 4.  In the upcoming saga expansion, it'd be lovely to have a 4 cost defender that grows to 9 defense.

Wow, I love this pack! Makes me want to revisit Pipes, Songs, and Dunhere all at once. I haven't had this many new deck ideas floating around in my head for a while.

Plus, I think that refugee is exactly what my Harad deck is missing to really make it sing.

I'd definitely use the Defender of Cair Andros at 30+ threat, so long as I had at least two Tactics Heroes. A 3/3 defensive ally is nothing to sneeze at. I'd be tempted to stick Raiment of War on him too.

I had to look up Fastred. Apparently he was one of the princes of Rohan who died in the Battle of the Crossings of Poros (I see what you did there, Caleb) over 100 years before the War of the Ring.

Surely this Fastred must just be named after that one, right?

Very excited by Fastred, DoCA, and Dunedain Pipe. I'm glad, because the cards that were spoiled before didn't look too good apart from Oath of Eorl.

I think Fastred and Dunhere will work well together. If an enemy slips by bounce him back with Fastred, reducing your threat, and have Dunhere smack him about.

Bastion Defender, Pipe of the West, Dunedain Refugee and Song of Eorl by themselves justify buying this deluxe pack.

Correct. Fastred is mentioned in the song of the Mounds of Mundburg as one of the Rohirrim who died in the Battle of Pelennor Fields, but I don't think anything else is known about him.

Previously in the game we've seen Dúnhere (chieftain of Harrowdale, and Unfinished Tales mentions that he is nephew to Erkenbrand), Guthláf (Théoden's banner-bearer), Déorwine (chief of Théoden's knights), and Grimbold (who distinguished himself at both battles of the Ford of Isen, who led the muster of the West-mark after Helm's Deep, and who--like Éomer and Elfhelm--led one of the first three éoreds at the battle of Pelennor Fields). Like Fastred, I don't think we know anything else about Harding, Herefara, Herubrand, and Horn. I didn't expect to see any of them as heroes (though perhaps as allies), but the fact that Fastred shares a name (and a similar fate) with a prince buried at the Crossings of Poros (Théoden's great-uncle) likely accounts for Fastred's promtion to hero status.

I'm surprised by the lack of enthusiasm about Fastred. He's really interesting:

1) though they are more common these days, heroes with 3 defense as a base is always good. In Rohan he's the alternative defender to Erkenbrand.

2) his ability is easily triggered and 2 threat reduction is huge, it's not uncommon to defend once a turn, and there are ways to boost fastred defense. I can see a Raiment of War on that guy.

3) he makes staging area Rohan pmuch more viable. Aa Fastred / Dunhere / Tactics Eowyn is only 23 starting threat. Pack up Rohan Warhorses and Unexpected Couragd. Throw a couple of Spear on Dunhere, even Eowyn with Forth Eorlingas. Could be ge great against many quests. 

He's definitely not bonkers but already so much better and fun than spirit Beregond.

Repeatable threat reduction is great.  Putting enemies in staging *after* you defend isn't so great.  Yes, he'll form a great combo with Dunhere, especially if you can boost Dunhere's attack, but I'm wondering how useful he'll be *outside* a Dunhere deck.  Fun is subjective, but no way I rate this guy as "better" than spirit Beregond.  Beregond is a better defender, and when he lowers your threat he doesn't simultaneously prevent you from counter-attacking and increase the threat in staging.

Besides Dunhere, I think the other hero that best combos with Fastred is TaAragorn, at least if multiple enemies exist.  Fastred can pop them into staging and TaAragorn can pull them right back out.  Argalad could be a good partner, and Haldir in a separate deck will work as well as Dunhere.

I presume if he defends attacks made from staging, the enemies can't be "returned" and don't trigger the threat reduction?

The "To" mean it is a cost to return the enemy to the staging are. If you can't pay the cost you don't get the benefit. So no threat reduction from attacks in the staging area.

## 21 [monkeyrama on July 19, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2888175)

I quite like the look of Fastred. I'm imagining a deck with Great Yew Bow and maybe Lore Faramir or Argalad having fun with bouncing enemies back to where they can be shot at. He could also be useful for getting specific enemies into traps after they've engaged, or making those staging area attack cards more viable for taking out certain enemies (or setting up big plays that need enemies in the staging area). If you play very low threat you could select which enemies to get a free threat reduction from providing they have low attack. Certainly an interesting hero, and a sign that the game is increasingly looking for alternative ways to play (rather than just engage and kill everyone). Does Fastred work well with a Dunedain engage deck for those quests that force you to engage an enemy?

Yeah, looks interesting. Actually this whole cycle has been fun for player cards. I'm getting a lot of enjoyment out of Thurundir in a Strider deck as well. Very cool.

I also wasn't sold much on allies that only kick in under Valour conditions, but now I'm quite happy with that: Veteran of Osgiliath is amazing in Valour, and the Cair Andros Defender could be similarly useful. I'll wait and see how he plays, but it could be very good.

Another point about Fastred is spirit Beregond as they are very similar. Beregond has better defensive stats, while fastred is better at attacking/questing (something I am not very fond of, as i prefer specialists; not taking into account guys like Erestor, who you play for their effect only^^). As a sentinel B. is better in multiplayer from the get go. Given Falstred gets rid of more threat, but B.'s condition does limit deck design space way less (if you want to get rid of enemies anytime).
So if you want a spirit defender (rare in general) who helps you reduce threat Beregond was already your man.

Just picked up my pack.  I hope to try it tonight, but may have to wait until the weekend.  The quest is DL8 and has three stages.  The only added card set is Harad Soldiers (crossed sword and spear).  There is no backstory for Fastred. (Which is not surprising as he is not a made up character.).  And there is a new version of Guarded which forces the objective to be guarded by a certain card type, enemy, location, etc.

The new article on ffg about this pack states that Fastred helps (hidden benefit) against Serpent Guard. I don't get it. The player has to pay the cost each time the enemy engages and also it lasts until the end of the round, so the position of that enemy has no influence so far...

I think, those guys at ffg are getting a bit lazy at designing cards lately. :/

I think the reasoning is, your threat hits 28, so it engages you. You defend it, send it back then drop your threat to 26.  You then have a round to come up wit a solution to it. 

Also Tactics Imrahil decks can benefit from the new DoCA. 

## 27 [dalestephenson on July 21, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2891438)

That's a narrow case, but I can see that.  Fastred might also be useful against Journey to Anduin's stage one if he can survive the Hill Troll's attack -- when your threat gets to 30, defend the Troll then pop it back in staging, you'll have two more turns to get ready.

A similar effect could be useful in Conflict at the Carrock -- defend against Stuart, pop him back in staging and now the other engaged troll(s) don't have +1 defense for your counter attack.  Plus the lowered threat might be enough to prevent Stuart from coming back in.

The real sweet enemies for Fastred are ones with an obnoxious while-engaged effect that could be worse than having the threat in staging.  It's too bad Huorns don't make ineffective attacks, they'd be great to return to staging in exchange for threat decrease.  But there are some other cards that would be worthwhile:

Dunland Berserker (VoI) attacks you every time you draw cards.  With only 2 threat and 2 attack, pop this guy back in staging anytime you can't kill him right away.  Other card-drawing while-engaged buffs from that cycle are Boar Clan Stalker & Boar Clan Warrior (Dunland Trap).

Bellach's Maurauder (Trouble at Tharbad) and Giant Swamp Adder and Neekerbreekers (Nin-in-Eleph) do obnoxious things when time counters are removed, so they are other great candidates to pop back in staging if you can't dispose of them.  Neekerbreekers are especially perfect -- low threat, low attack, high HP, and very obnoxious end-of-turn effects if engaged.

The passive effect from Guardians (Three Trials) will make them engaged again right away, so you can't avoid their time-removal attack -- however, if you can't damage them, you might as well get free threat reduction (with Mablung, you'd get a free resource as well!)

Southron Sailor and Umbar Captain (Gray Havens) have obnoxious when-engaged effects.  Southron Sailor in particular is a lovely target -- he has *0* threat, and his when-engaged ability is to count engaged ships against threat in staging.  With only 2 attack, Fastred can defend him all day, continously lowering your threat while actually *decreasing* the amount of threat in staging.

Corsair Seafarer and Serpent's Blade (Flight of the Stormcaller) also have obnoxious when-engaged.  The Seafarer gets his attack bumped up by questing/sailing heroes when engaged, Fastred can keep him at 2 attack indefinitely.

Thrashing Arm (Thing in the Depths) does 3 damage at the end of the combat phase.  With 5 attack he's a challenge for Fastred to handle, but if he has his defense up his ability could be useful.  It's a pity Eye of the Beast doesn't attack, it'd be perfect to pop back.

Faithless Desecrator (Temple of the Deceived) contributes its threat even while engaged, so one of Fastred's downsides doesn't apply.  Profane Dead from the same pack is another great target, he attacks when you travel to the right, and with only 1 threat isn't much of a liability in staging.

Umbar Slaver (City of Corsairs) gets buffed when the engaged player spends resources.  Pop him back in staging before the planning phase.

Uruk Chieftain (Sands of Harad) can't be damaged while engaged with another Orc.  Fastred can get out another Orc while saving your attackers for the Chieftain.

Evil Crow (Black Riders) adds to hide tests when engaged.  If you can't spare the attack to kill him, putting him back in staging might be an option, at 0 attack he's not likely to damage Fastred.  Black Rider and Rider of Mordor always have obnoxious while engaged effects, but their high threat makes them less attractive in staging and their high attack makes them more dangerous to defend.

Groping Dead, Dead Things, and Candle Bearer (Land of Shadow) all prevent you from lowering your threat when engaged.  If you've only got one and can't damage them, getting some rare threat reduction might be worth the extra threat in staging.

Barrow-Wight, Cold-Wight, and Dark-Wight (Fog on the Barrow Downs) all have obnoxious while engaged effects, they could be good targets if you want to enable a card effect they are prohibiting.

That's a minority of all quests, but it's still a fair number.

Here is the text for Serpent Guard:

> Quote
> 
> Forced: After The Serpent’s Guard engages you, either remove 2 progress from the main quest, or enemies engaged with you cannot take damage until the end of the round. 

So I think the idea behind Fastred is that you have one player that is good at attacking enemies in the staging area (Dunhere, Haldir, Great Yew Bow, etc.). When The Serpent Guard engages you, you happily choose the second option (enemies engaged with you cannot take damage) because you will be sending him back to the staging area this turn anyway, where he can be destroyed.

Also no one mentionned Fastred's synergy with the "staging area direct damage" Rangers of ithilien, Lore Faramir plus Great Yew Bow. In the early days of the Trap archetype I would have loved to see that guy.

You know, the *very next sentence* after the one you quoted was this:

Yes, he'll form a great combo with Dunhere, especially if you can boost Dunhere's attack, but I'm wondering how useful he'll be *outside* a Dunhere deck.

I'm still wondering.  He'll also work with Haldir in another deck, he'll work against certain enemies in a variety of quests, with some setup he'll make a nice combo with Great Yew Bow and/or some traps, TaAragorn can pull enemies out of staging--I'm not claiming he's Spirit Pippin, I'm claiming he's only useful in narrow circumstances.  His special ability mimics one of the game's more annoying shadow effects.

## 32 [dalestephenson on July 22, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2892947)

Let's compare Fastred to the other repeatable threat-reducing heroes:

Dwalin: reduce threat by 2 for destroying an orc.  Something you want to do anyway; not useful at all in some quests.

Galadriel: exhaust to lower threat by 1 and draw card.  Both positive effects; the cost is really that her exhaustion isn't good for anything else without her ring.

Merry: exhaust to lower threat by a just revealed enemies threat.  Cost is exhaustion, though with 2 wp and Hobbit Pony it's not a great cost.

Nori: reduce threat by 1 after playing a dwarf from your hand, something you want to do anyway

Beregond: lower defending player's threat by 1 when defending and taking no damage.  Something you want to do anyway.

Fastred: after defending, put enemy back in staging -- something you *usually* don't want to do at all, since it increases threat in staging and prevents normal counterattacks.

He's certainly interesting, but he's the first repeatable hero where he would want to do the hero action that triggers the threat reduction; but then might not take the threat reduction because of the side effects.

## 33 [Onidsen on July 22, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/254468-black-serpent-spoilers-on-cgdb/?do=findComment&comment=2893170)

Defender of Cair Andros also opens up interesting possibilities with Hirgon, I think. Quest successfully, bring the DoCA in for 3 cost instead of 4, and then raise threat by 1 to give him +1 defense. If you start near 30 threat, that could easily be a 3-cost/4-defense/3-hit point ally on the round he enters play. I haven't tested it out yet, but I like what I see.

Fastred makes Dunhere much easier to play, as has already been noted. Also seems like a good enabler for Trap decks - which mostly want to send their enemies back to the staging area; it's much easier to control which enemy hits the trap that way. Mostly his ability really boosts staging area attack; if you aren't interested in that (in whatever form), you aren't hugely interested in Fastred. Might be able to do something interesting with Hama and Forth Eorlingas. Might even be able to do something janky with I Am Not A Stranger to get another high-attack hero attacking the staging area too.

How about Fastred + Desperate Alliance?  Get an unwanted enemy off another player and lower their threat by two for zero cost.

Finished my first game and while I did win it, I would have threated out the next turn.  I think I only drew two locations the entire game.  After one go I would say it's a hard quest, but not an 8, at least for solo.

I was hoping to get a bunch of games in this weekend but life intervened.  In any event I did get in a second attempt and it turned south quickly.  Scooped on turn four with a dead hero and only one ally in play.  So the quest CAN be a brute.

I've only got a couple of games in so far, but i've not come close to a win yet. Seems brutal in solo. Maybe its just the styles of deck i've tried so far.

Two wins for three tries.  This one definitely has a "turn the corner feel to it".

I finally got around to playing this last night, and with this particular strategy in one deck (Lore Faramir plus Great Yew Bow). The problem I have with that style is that it's hard to get Faramir up in attack high enough to kill enemies in the staging area, even with the effective +2 attack from The Black Serpent and the enemy you're attacking. I beat the quest, largely because the other deck (Elrond, Eowyn(t), Kahliel) was so strong and the Harad allies are really good - Jubayr in particular is epic against quests with a fair number of 3 attack non-unique enemies. I'm thinking that Gondorian Fire might be a way to make Faramir more effective?

I do like Fastred though. His ability isn't that big of a problem, if you plan around it. My stupid mistake was to think that his ability could combo with Hobbit pipe, but that specifies event card threat reduction (reading fail on my part), so Frodo in that deck was useless. 

Black Serpent, though, is *such* a good quest. Challenging but not in a *smashed in the face* way. You can think around it. Very good!
