Hello,

 

I’ve called every game store within a 3 hour drive from me. No one hosted or is going to be hosting a fellowship event. I’m looking to see if anyone here acquired an extra kit and would be interested in selling? Name your price as it’s apparently going to be very hard for me to get the mat, and card otherwise.

I'm afraid you may just have to prepare for a long drive. Fellowship Kits this year have been very scarce, due to FFG forgetting to announce a release date. ?

Something bad happened this year... None of the local stores are returning my calls about the Fellowship Event for some reason. I suspect they themselves are uncertain where their stock is.
