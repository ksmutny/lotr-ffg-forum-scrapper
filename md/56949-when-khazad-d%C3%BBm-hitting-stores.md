Hey Guys,

Just wanted to check to see if the Khazad-dûm Expansion is coming out for stores in early December or later December.  The reason being the store owner of where I game tends to forget to order the FFG products and I want to know when to remind him. 

Thanks,

Will

We don't know yet.  It is still on the boat, according to the "Upcoming" link at the top of the page.  The boat can take weeks to get here, unload, etc.

 On a side note: I've been totally unable to find Khazad-Dum on Amazon. I want to put it on my wishlist as I have relatives who look there when Christmas shopping.

i heard that amazon are late with releases, and they like to change their pre order details

I think late December makes the most sense, given what we know. Although it would be in their best interest to have ready a little earlier, say pre-Christmas. And yes, do not put any stock in Amazon LCG release dates.

Yeah, it's a shame too and I have Amazon Prime. But, I gave up on Amazon after the first two APs. They always stock late or mislable them (I remember Amazon labling some APs $17 and discount them to $15 *facepalm*). So I instead of that I go to FRPgames.com. They get those suckers the moment they're released (I think I got Return to Mirkwood before FFG store had it for sale lol). Khazad is $24 pre-order there at the moment.

 Thanks for the info guys.  Hopefully it'll get released soon. I'm really looking forward to what new quests players make with the new encounter cards.
