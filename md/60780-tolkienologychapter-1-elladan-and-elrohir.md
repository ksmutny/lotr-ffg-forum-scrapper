# [Tolkienology:chapter 1- Elladan and Elrohir](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60780-tolkienologychapter-1-elladan-and-elrohir/)

## 1 [richsabre on February 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60780-tolkienologychapter-1-elladan-and-elrohir/?do=findComment&comment=597077)

This is a (lets call it a blog) series that I have wanted to start for some time, however have not been able to justify taking up forum space until the recent addition of catagories. Now that there is catagories, I am hoping this will be a little better received, as the more important stuff has its own place now, and the general area has a bit more freedom.

So, let me introduce you to Tolkienology- a series that takes a look at the many fascinating people and places that we have encountered in the game so far. I don’t claim to be a Tolkien expert, however I have had a rather unhealthy obsession with Middle Earth since I was around 11, so hopefully I can make this interesting and informative to those who have little or a casual knowledge in Middle Earth, and still an entertaining read to those who are better versed in Tolkien lore. Its also a chance for me to brush up on characters/events i dont have as much knowledge as id like on.

The first chapter takes a look at whats currently flying round the forum discussions- Elladan and Elrohir.

 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 

Elladan and Elrohir are the identical twin brothers (though it is never said they were twins outright, it is heavily suggested given Elf reproductive cycles cannot allow for 2 non-twin births in the same year) and sons of Elrond of Rivendell and Celebrian of Lothlorien (who was Celeborn and Galadriel's daughter). They are also therefore Arwen's siblings as well, and seeing as Elrond fostered Aragorn, then he can be seen as a sort of non-blood relative. They were born in the year 130 of the Third Age (though i have seen it as 130 and 139 in various encyclopedias, but the appendices in the book tops), and it is indicated that they were inseparable. Elladan means Elf-Man, or as Tolkien states in his letters, more specifiacally Elf-Numenorean, showing his dual decent, and Elrohir means Elf-Knight, though rohir’s literal translation is horse-lord (rohirrim for istance), though Tolkien specifically stated that it meant the former.

Despite being elves of high birth, the brothers both sought a life more akin to that of the Dunedain- the Rangers of the North, often helping them in protecting the remnants of Arnor in the north. This was in no small part due to the fact that their mother, Celebrian, was ambushed by orcs in the year 2509, whilst crossing the High Pass of the Misty Mountains (the same pass that Thorin and co. are attacked in in The Hobbit). She was wounded with a poisoned arrow, and despite her rescue, she departed Middle Earth to the Undying Lands. From then on the brothers kept a special grudge against orcs, and hunted them wherever they could find them.

During The War of the Ring and the events of the trilogy, the brothers aid Aragorn alongside the other members of the Grey Company- a small group of rangers who travel towards rohan and accompany Aragorn through the Paths of the Dead and onto the epic battle of The Pelennor Fields, and then presumably onto the battle before the Morannon (the battle before the black gate).

After the fall of Sauron and the departing of their father from the Grey Havens, they are said to remain in Rivendell for some time, as they, like their sister Arwen, were given the choice to remain in Middle Earth or depart to the Undying Lands. It is never said by Tolkien that they chose either way, but given the delay, many think they chose the life of mortal men, though either way, it can be said with certainty, that they both chose the same fate.

 

Well that's it for chapter 1...a little short seeing as they arent really central characters, but i couldnt resist the obvious choice given the hype around their synergy. So, post if you have any input, or if ive made any mistakes.

 

peace

Rich

 As soon as I saw the Elrohir card I thought, "Richsabre should write a thread about him so people can learn more about him." It's cool to see that you actually did!

as in rhun? because theres not much to tell, unless we find alatar and pallando and ask them what they foundgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] aragorn had also been there, and sauron obviously had some sort of power base there. it was also the lands of the easterlings which he allied with in the war of the ring, and we know one ringwraith - Khamul the Easterling, came from there

though i admit it'd be fun to collect as much info from good sources as possible and try and write something, though in the end itd still be 90% speculation

That's already enough for me.
You have a good knowledge of Tolkien's world, and you have lesser chances to mess up than I do.

Also, on an unrelated note...
Vampires and Werewolves in Middle-Earth; where they do come from and how do they interact with other of the Peoples?
One of the 'encounter sets' I'm designing is based on vampires, but I really have no much knowledge about them.

 

Thanks.

firstly before you quote me i actually did get a bit mixed up on the above, when i said sauron conquored the easterlings that isnt entirely true as they were already evil from the 1st age, in the service of melkor (this just shows how limited my knowledge on it is!!!)

vampires are mentioned in the 1st age- melkor had them in his service, and sauron took the shape of one for a while, so they exist in middle earth and have done, though obviously tolkien doesnt particualrly refer to them in the third age other than vampire bats- which may or may not be related

werewolves similarly have a basis in 1st age, sauron had them in his service, in the isle of the werewolves where he ruled, and again sauron took the form of a werewolf to fight huan in the quest of the silmaril, though was beaten and fled in the form of a bat- they arent to be mixed up with wargs though, who are creatures, however werewolves are evil spirits in wolf form, note- they couldnt shape shift like the stereotypical werewolf of legend (sauron could as he was a shapeshifter), however they could talk, likewise the wargs of the 3rd age could talk though they tended to use their own speech, so its speculated that they were decendants of the original werewolves

Hmmm, this is good. Very good.
It's really a shame that my last necromancy ritual to bring Tolkien back didn't work, though, I would love to read stuff about these more 'obscure' topics. Anyway, I like the fact it is open-ended.

 

Thanks again and sorry to misrepresent (sp? don't know if this word actually applies here) your topic.

i would recommend you check out these little known topics onthe web, as id be the first to admit i have a limited knowledge ESPECIALLY of the 1st age as my interests tend to lie in the third age, and barring us actually getting tolkien back- we have to speculate alot

also its fine, i hoped that these would turn into debates anyways, and to anyone else who has a more informed idea of werewolves and vampires please chip in gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

note-i may have added some to the previous posts describing them since you posted your reply- i had to quickly fish out my encylopedia to make sure what i was saying was 1.true and 2. made sense

## 18 [richsabre on February 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60780-tolkienologychapter-1-elladan-and-elrohir/?do=findComment&comment=597179)

further note: 1. it is speculated that the spirits that inhabited the bat and wolf forms were in fact lesser maiar- though again i think this is specualtion

2.just like werewolves werent shapeshifters, vampires were huge bats in form, not the shapeshifters that we think of when we hear vampire

3.vampires are hardly mentioned in tolkiens works, in fact there are only two of what i can find- both of which were maiar taking that form- so it would be a far stretch to have them appear in numbers (or at all) in the third age

phew - that was some hasty research.....ive learned alot i didnt know about 1st age tolkien mythology in the last hour lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

and a final note- its been a long while since i read the silmarillion and lets face it- it isnt the most accessable of tolkien's work and certainly isnt easy to remember everything in it, so if anyone has found anything wrong with the previous posts, then please say so, so i know whats what :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

i think i made the mistake of rushing through it when i was younger, its really not the same style of narrative as the hobbit and the trilogy however i was too young to really appreciate it and how crucial it is to explaining tolkiens universe, i am planning to read it properly when ive finished my current re-read cycle- im currently on the two towers

ive actually seen someone post that it should be listed as a cure for insomnia before- which suffering from this i can tell you 1.that it doesnt work and 2.thats so harsh!!!!!!! sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif]no work of tolkien can be considered boring, its just people like me go in to reading it after reading his other works, and dont realise its meant to be different, which of course now i know different

Thats a brilliant first episode Richsabre. I think players of the game will be interested to learn the history of the various character cards before them. One thing that has puzzled me though, after reading various books on the history of Middle Earth, is why Elladan and Elrohir remained there, resulting in being mortal. Obviously Arwen chose that life to be with Aragorn but why did Elladan and Elrohir decide to stay? Ive always thought it was to live out their lives as part of the Dunedain but was there a bigger reason?

i think that you got it with the dunedain part- perhaps they hung around mortals for too long, though youd think theyd be keen to see their mother- so perhaps the departed after all, in fact i read somewhere that tolkien states in a letter that they 'remained in rivendell for a while' (not direct quote) so if this is correct then it implies they left

- remember also that their sister arwen stayed, and their adopted (and also in law....is that correct? i always get inlaws confused) brother aragorn was mortal, and lived on after the events of the trilogy

Did Aragorn and Arwen ever have the son that Arwen saw in her vision? (I am assuming here that the movies offered an accurate portrayal of the book in this regard)

Yeh sounds like a choice between going home to live with mum and dad or staying in touch with Arwen/ being in the Grey Company. Being a Tolkien fan, like yourself, its frustrating knowing that there are a million more questions to be answered! Have you seen the 'Hunt For Gollum' on You tube? Theyve given it a good go and done it for the enjoyment of fans. Respect due.

aragorn and arwen had a son eldarion telcontar (telcontar was the house name that aragorn's lineage became when he became king elessar of the reunited kingdom)- i would recommend reading the tale of aragorn and arwen in the trilogy appendices- its a few pages long and it actually almost brought me to tears....sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]...i know laugh at me haha

Interestingly enough tolkien once had a plan to make The New Shadow- a book set in the reign of aragorns son, but dropped the idea!!! i didnt know that until recently, however i think it was probably the best descision of tolkiens life- reading the plot line, it sounded err.. (sorry master tolkien) terrible...even tolkien himself stated it as not worth doing

i have seen it, and yes it was very entertaining, however it would have been nice for them to chose a different style, as it had peter jackson written all over it- im not sure if they meant to or not

Thanks for this and for the rest of your "Tolkienology" series - you've got me re-reading Unfinished Tales which is definitely a good thing!

It's a fascinating little question as to the "choice" of Elrohir and Elladan regarding mortality. I'm not convinced that it is logical that they would have the choice at all (I know - I think - that Tolkien indicated that they did in a letter, but then of course Tolkien was himself in a continuous process of rethinking and rewriting all kinds of points, and as a result there are many gaps and inconsistencies within a lot of this "background" material).

As I see it, there are actually two separate choices:

1. The Choice of Luthien - the option that always appears to have been open to Elven women to marry mortal Men and thereby sacrifice their own immortality, this choice being made in the First Age by Luthien (obviously) and others.

2. The Choice given to Elrond and his brother Elros at the end of the First Age, this choice being given by virtue of their unusual mixed lineage. Elros of course chose mortality and founded Numenor, Elrond chose Elf-hood and immortality.

As I see it, choice (2) committed not just Elrond and Elros but also all their descendants to the original decision. This is certainly the case for Elros - his descendants, the Kings of Numenor, did not themselves get the chance to opt for immortality, and indeed later came to bitterly resent this decision, resulting in the downfall of Numenor.

Therefore, by this logic, Elrond's decision would have committed all his children to Elf-hood. Arwen, in TLOTR, is separately able to make the choice of Luthien like some of her forebears, but Elrohir and Elladan would not have this option.

Leaving this aside, it is a fascinating speculation as to what choice they would have made. It's pretty clear from their role in TLOTR that they aligned themselves closely with Aragorn and the Dunedain, and I think it's clear that in the undetailed backstory they have spent much time riding the wild with the Rangers, slaying Orcs and so on. All this points in the direction of the choice of mortality. You could even imagine the scenario where one twin chooses to stay and the other to depart.

Anyway, I've really enjoyed running Elrohir and Elladan in the game - it's great that these characters who are minor in terms of their role in the book, but are clearly among the mightiest and most nobly descended of all the peoples of Middle-earth, get their chance in the sun.

As I see it, there are actually two separate choices:

1. The Choice of Luthien - the option that always appears to have been open to Elven women to marry mortal Men and thereby sacrifice their own immortality, this choice being made in the First Age by Luthien (obviously) and others.

2. The Choice given to Elrond and his brother Elros at the end of the First Age, this choice being given by virtue of their unusual mixed lineage. Elros of course chose mortality and founded Numenor, Elrond chose Elf-hood and immortality.

As I see it, choice (2) committed not just Elrond and Elros but also all their descendants to the original decision. This is certainly the case for Elros - his descendants, the Kings of Numenor, did not themselves get the chance to opt for immortality, and indeed later came to bitterly resent this decision, resulting in the downfall of Numenor.

Therefore, by this logic, Elrond's decision would have committed all his children to Elf-hood. Arwen, in TLOTR, is separately able to make the choice of Luthien like some of her forebears, but Elrohir and Elladan would not have this option.



I was about to reply before I read your post, which I think explains things quite well, thanks!  The choice that Elladan/Elrohir had was simply whether to remain in Middle-Earth or leave, not the choice of which race to join (such as Elros/Elrond). 

In other posts (no need to repeat the same grudges here), we've discussed some of the "liberties" the movies take with the characters.  Hugo Weaving's portrayal of Elrond seems to be very critical of mankind in general.  While the book "version" of Elrond definitely has his doubts about mankind, Hugo seems to push it into real disdain.  I actually find this pretty intriguing: much of Tolkien's stories stress the importance of relationship and family/comradeship.  In my mind, I've always wondered if, beyond a general distrust of a race that seems to be easily led astray, Elrond harbors some deeper anger towards a race that "took" his brother away from him.  On the other side, that is likely the very obvious reason he shelters Aragorn, while at the same seemingly pushing him to greatness.  As the heir to his beloved brother, I would imagine that it's a "tough love" attempt at preserving an honorable line for him….
