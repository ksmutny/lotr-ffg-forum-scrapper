Amazing article. I love reading your stuff! I want more!

And if we needed even more reason to be in awe at Glorfindel....

As a side note, Tulikoura is amazing (had never seen his work previously)

Many thanks! I enjoy writing these and wish I had more time to crank them out. Master of Lore (Mike) and I are thinking of doing shorter articles in the future, focusing more on history. In the meantime, check the Facebook feed for some nice tidbits that he is releasing.

Thanky you! As someone who is not that deep into Tolkien lore I just learned a lot. You've certainly  got a talent for writing.
