A kid it taking on a baby dinosaur. Not exactly the most frightening monster out there (i.e. not Lovecraftian enough :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ) but sure I guess... haha

Yeah. My (not constructive) comment pointed out that the artworkon the LOTR LCG Unexpected Courage is hard to see (looks like someone fighting a big spider... or is it?)    :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

"The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear. And the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown."

 

Which means the LotR card is actually the best, because you can't make fangs or tentacles of the picture :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

To me there was always a dwarf blowing a horn surrounded by spiders.

Gaping dragon is hands down most badass and epic boss introduction in Dark Souls 1.
