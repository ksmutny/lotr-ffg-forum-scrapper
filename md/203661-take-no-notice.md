What is the intent of Take No Notice?  If you have X Hobbit heroes and Y Ranger heroes does it reduce the cost by [X + Y] or [X] or [Y]?

 

I know we've had this discussion of the word "or" on some cards clearly meaning "nor" but that isn't relevant here since there is no negative in the cost reduction text.

 

So, is "or" in the case of Take No Notice supposed to be "and" or did they intentionally use "or" so you have to choose X or Y.

 

I am pretty sure it is supposed to reduce the cost by X+Y, but I can see the text being interpreted either way. 

 

1) Lower the cost to play Take No Notice by 1 for each Hobbit or [each] Ranger hero you control

 

2) Lower the cost to play Take No Notice by 1 for each Hobbit [and each] Ranger hero you control

 

To me, the omission of "each" where I've included it in option 1 makes me believe the correct interpretation is option 2.

I guess neither of my interpretations would be entirely accurate.  As you could theoretically have a hero that is both a Hobbit and a Ranger.  I think that means you would still add X+Y, but the current wording would prevent you from double counting a hero that had both the Hobbit and Ranger trait.

I'd say it is -1 for each hero with either of those traits.

 

Such as, -1 for each "hobbit or ranger" trait.

-1 for each hero you control that has either the hobbit or ranger trait.

Agreed on the X+Y interpretation with no double counting.
