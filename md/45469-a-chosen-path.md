In the introductory scenario, Passage through Mirkwood, there are two stage three quest cards- on the 3a side, both are the same "A chosen path" but on the 3b side they are different. "Beorn's Path" requires players to get 10 points of progress and for Ungoliant's spawn not to be in play, whereas "don't leave the path" adds spiders and requires that Ungoliant's spawn be found AND defeated, but requires no quest points.

Those don't seem like compatible victory conditions, so I guess you only use one- but how do you decide, is it random? which do people think would be easier?

Read card 2B of that quest deck and you will find out...

 

Spoiler : Yes, it´s a random choice.

We missed the random bit and assumed that you choose either the safer but longer path, or the shorter dangerous one where you had to deal wth the big bad.

Thanks - I hadn't played it yet as I hadn't been able to figure out which 3 to use- and therefore hadn't read 2b.

bit of a circular problem...
