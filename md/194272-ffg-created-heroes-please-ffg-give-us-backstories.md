Dear FFG, Matt, Caleb,

 

I think lots of us really appreciate that you gave some backstory to the FFG-created hero lately: Idraen, Rossiel or Amarthiúl for instance. Especially, I found the backstory of Rossiel to be really compelling, making her a character I want to play although I was a bit skeptical about the whole theme/mechanics of victory display manipulation in the first place. Now I'd like to play elven magic.

 

I would be really really cool if you could give us the backstories of the other FFG-created heroes, namely Thalin, Eleanor, Beravor, Mirlonde and Caldara. I know some of them where already part of Middle-Earth quest RPG (the first three of them), so maybe part of my request can already be found somewhere. Anyway, I think it'd be a great addition to the "support" section online. I realise there's some work involved here, but I'm asking nonetheless.

 

PS: Oh and even the few unique allies you created along the way: Emery, Brok Ironfist, Henemarth Riversong and the next Eldahir, could we know just in a few lines who those fine free-people are?

 

Thanks for the amazing game  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Backstory for Ingold > Count me In for Gold. 

I think there is too many named allies. But for the heroes, sure, it would be very nice.

Ingold is from the book.

There aren't that many FFG-original unique allies, banania just listed most if not all of them.

 

On Brok Ironfist, incidentally, Master of Lore did an article a while back which talked about what his backstory might be: https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2015/04/03/brok-ironfist/ [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2015/04/03/brok-ironfist/]

I found it pretty interesting.

I second banania!

Agree 100%. Would be really cool to get some fluff from FFG to flesh out these characters. 

 

Also, let's be honest, it would be good practice for FFG as we ramp up for Legend of the Five Rings. That's an IP that is going to require them to seriously up their game as far as community storytelling goes and the established history and fanbase of LotR is a good place for them to take some baby-steps there. 

 

DO NOT want to see them do too much more storytelling through the quests though--at least not for named, unique characters. I thought it was really cool with Amarthiul but it really kind of bugs me as someone who does not build for specific quests that the quest limits my hero choice...

I actually quite like named/unique allies.  FFG tends to put more interesting effects on them, or make them more powerful, in ways that make them far more fun to play with compared to their non-unique counterparts (See Orophin vs Silverlode Archer or Arwen vs 2 cost spirit allies).  It also gives a better sense of immersion.

 

I think Thalin, Eleanor and Beravor were originally from Middle-Earth Quest, and there may be some background material in that game, though I'm not 100% sure.

I support this. I would especially like to see Caldara's backstory.

This is a very good and smart request.

Some background story for Mirlonde and Caldara would be awesome. Reprint are very frequent for the game, i hope the next reprint of AP 2 and 5 of Against The Shadow cycle will include your request.

 

By the way, I noticed that FFG created heroes are only released in AP 2 and AP 5, and never in Deluxe boxes(if i except Core Set obviousy). I do not think this is random, i think this is a deliberate pattern.

 

Cycle 3: Against The Shadow

AP2 : Mirlonde

AP5 : Caldara

 

Cycle 4: The Ring Maker

AP2: Idraen

 

Cycle 5: Angmar Awakened

AP2: Rossiel

AP5: Amarthiul

 

We will see in the future releases, but if my idea is correct, we will have a FFG created hero in AP2 of the Dream Chaser. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Awesome idea :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I would love to see in the future releases more of FFG created Heroes ( Rohan and Noldor pls <3 ) and their background stories.
