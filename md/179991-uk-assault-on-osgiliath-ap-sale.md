Ok, I cant find that this is out of the rules anywhere (apologies if it is) but other FFG forums seem ok to sell through...so...

 

In my massive buying frenzy I have accidentally doubled up on Assault On Osgiliath, oops.

 

I can stick it on ebay but thats a bit of hastle setting up my seller profile again, so does anyone here UK want to buy?

 

Dont want to profit, just cover my costs. Pack is still all sealed etc brand new.

 

Amazon UK has it at £11.46 posted (or £9.67 if you spend over £20) and ebay right today has it at £12(posted) and online shops are out of stock.

So £10.50 including postage seems fair, anyone want to take up the offer? Payment via paypal.

 

If anyone is interested then either pop a post on or a PM please. If no takers I will likely go the ebay route.

 

Cheers

Alex
