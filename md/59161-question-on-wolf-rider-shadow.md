I drew the Wolf Rider as the shadow effect on another card....shadow texts reads:

"Wolf Rider attacks the defending player. That player may declare 1 character as a defender. Deal Wolf Rider its own Shadow Card. After Combat, return Wolf Rider to the top of the encounter deck."

A few questions:

1. Do i deal a new shadow card for the first card (that Wolf Rider was draw as a shadow for)?

2. Wolf Rider essentially becomes an attacking enemy and treated like all the others that are attacking in the combat phase?

any other thoughts on this card that i may be missing?

 Wolf rider is your shadow card for the enemy.  (his attack is the shadow effect.)  You only need to draw a card for the wolf rider now.  Yes, it is as if he is another enemy attacking, except that afterwards, he goes back to the top of the encounter deck.

annoying! LOL. Not as annoying as the Wargs card (no shadow effect = back to staging area) but...still annoying.

I ended up using Quick Strike....killed the punk before he could reveal the shadow card!
