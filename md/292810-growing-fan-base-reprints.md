FFG, there is a very active community on FB for LotR and people clamoring for reprints.  Thank you for the reprints that have come so far.  There are an odd number of missing ones though that I don't get.  The Thing in the Depths, Temple of the Deceived and the Wilds of Rhovanion are all completely out of stock everywhere though those are fairly recent sets.  Hopefully another round of the "Great LotR Reprint of 2019" will happen and we'll all be basking in LotR LCG greatness!
