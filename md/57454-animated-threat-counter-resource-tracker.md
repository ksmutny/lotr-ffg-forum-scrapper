Â I've decided to make an animated threat counter / resource tracker in html5 useable by android / ios / pc. I was going to scan the components of the threat counter this morning but I can't get it apart without breaking it. Does anyone have a scan of the face, left and right wheel?

I just bought my 2nd core set :-) So I can send you the scans, if you're still in need of them. PM me a friend invite and your email, and I'll send them to you
