Are you guys saying I managed to miss the Dwarrowdelf Cycle TWICE in less than 24 hours?  Aarrrrrggghhhh!

I did get to order The Long Dark, which is still in stock as of this writing.  One out of six, sigh.  Hope they get more in.

I also managed to pick up The Lost Realm, so that completes my collection of Deluxe expansions.

the struggle is real. Be sure to get some wish lists set up with alerts on other sites to cover some bases.

I was checking the stock ever half hour or so. Hopefully there are a few more restocks for you to grab what you need.

Yeah it is.  Just got the Road to Rivendell.  I'm missing seven packs altogether, and one saga expansion. 

Getting closer.

Thank you, FFG, for all of these LotR:LCG reprints!

Yay!  I'm about to go broke....and I love it!  Thanks FFG!

Yes! Thanks for listening. Looks like some income tax refund will be gone in about two weeks!

I'll echo that, although the last couple of days have been pretty nerve-wracking lol.  

I'm only missing two adventure packs now.  But yeah, it's been expensive.

Guys, is this how re-prints usually go??  Very frustrating!  After hearing rumors of the Dwarrowdelf cycle reprint I had been checking FFG for them to show up.  Didn't check for a few days because...well, family, job, life in general... Looked last night and to my delight saw that several things were "Shipping" and in stock - and now they're out?  Surely this can't be the norm from FFG.  Very disappointing if it is.  

That said, I have asked for re-stock notifications from online sources...so we'll see.

When things are listed at "Shipping Now" that usually means they're shipping out to the various retailers. FFG will get things in stock much quicker BUT have much less quantity than the retailers.

I really hope the Dream Chaser cycle will be printed again soon. I’m only missing one AP. ><

Not for FFG, but for LotR LCG, sadly. This game lost a lot of attention when Asmodee took over.

There is again some dwarrowdelf packs available. (And Hobbit - on the doorstep saga expansion too)

The Treason of Saruman is also available on the FFG Store. 

Is there any word if these reprints will be distributed through other online retailers or just through the FFG Store?

As Ive got it most part of reprint stock went to retailers. Its just needs more time for it to get to em.
