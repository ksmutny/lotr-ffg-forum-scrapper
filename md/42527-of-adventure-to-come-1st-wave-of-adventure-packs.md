With every adventure pack coming with new scenarios (on cards?), and locations (especially with the article describing one pack as "location heavy,") I'm very curious to see how many cards will be useful in truly customizing your decks.  The article mentions half of each deck is devoted to new player cards, but when divided between all four spheres of influence (and presumably, some general cards any sphere may use?), I'm really curious to see how much my decks will change between releases.  Also very curious to see how many new enemy cards get released each month, as I think that's going to be a lot of the fun of this game.

In any case, so many locations, etc should make a lot of opportunities to design or play great (or awful) user-created scenarios.

I agree with you.  It is looking like a very restrictive game that does not really promote deck-building.

Why?

The co-op quests and gameplay likely means that many of the co-op specific cards are not useful in solo.

The quests themselves seem to take up half the expansion packs.  (See Hunt for Gollum Preview).  So in reality half those cards are only useful when you play that one quest....not usefull in other decks.

Lastly, with only a single hero(1x copy) it means you would have to buy multiples of the little expansions as well.  I thought it was 3x everything in all expansions but the core but apparently not.  The core also has a distribution that has 1x, 2x, 3x.  For example I have lots of MECCG decks and some of them have Elrond or Bilbo, but the decks have different purposes.  I don't have to rip the decks apart each time to fish out that one character.

Then there is the Threat mechanic which powers the whole thing.  It seems like nearly all the gameplay is based off it.

My guess is that this is in reality a co-op boardgame with infinite scenario expansions.

I mean sure, you could tweak the pre-built decks in the core and the Chapter Packs...but it is not looking like it will be anything as flexible as LCG/CCG players are used to.

But on the bright side, I don't see any reason to buy multiple core sets now.

I hope you are wrong about this, but what you say seems a fair comment from what we know. A shame if it isnt as flexible as classics like Star Wars CCG (Decipher) & the solo play with MECCG (Iron Crown).

The characters might be outside of your playdeck anyway so only having one might not matter.  (you would  not have to keep fishing them out of your decks).

On the other hand, I was thinking that maybe the other half of the pack with all those Quest/Scenario related cards might just allow us to create custom-scenarios.  That could be a whole new sort of interesting deck-building that has never been available before.

From what we've been shown so far this pretty much seems the case; you choose your 3 Heroes before play begins and once the game has started, you can only bring Allies into play, not additional Heroes. So no need for several copies of Bilbo, Aragorn, Legolas, etc.

From the pics, looks like the Adventure Packs are going to be named:

Adventure Pack #1: The Hunt for Gollum
Adventure Pack #2: [Grimbeorn?] at the Carrock
Adventure Pack #3: A Journey to Rhosgobel
Adventure Pack #4: The Hills of Emyn Muil
Adventure Pack #5: The Dead Marshes
Adventure Pack #6: Return to Mirkwood

Can't wait for these! And for the rules PDF, of course...gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

I posted this in one of the articles but I find it very strange that half the cards are for the encounter deck/enemy. I had been under the assumption that this was going to be more or less a fixed deck with only quests and perhaps objectives swapping out. I think it is strange that there is a deck building component to this as you will be fighting against this deck. I suppose the rules might clarify this but if it is this way it will be strange to tune and enhance a deck that you will be fighting against.

 

I really wish there was a way for one person to play as the enemy/encounter deck. Kind of like in a Dungeon Master type role where 1 person plays against the rest of the fellowship.

I think the characters will be a pregame decision. Or we'll get three copies of each hero in the AP.   And it's too early to tell, but 9 new player cards per pack might be fine for sphere synergy (spheregy :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])   Mono-sphere decks might be boring to play right out of the gate. Or they might be too strong. I guess we can tell in a four player game in which everyone plays one sphere. Could be interesting.  

 @Darksbane. I replied to you in that article.  Encounter deck customization could add a level of competition :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Nope. That wouldn't serve any purpose whatsoever since one hero cannot be used multiple times in any given game and as has been mentioned several times already, the hero cards are not actually a part of your deck.

To me it makes prefect sense to get roughly half player cards and half encounter cards. Replayability for this games comes (mainly) from two sources: tuning the player decks and varying the composition of the encounter deck. If the encounter deck was fixed you could stop tuning your player deck at some point. But if your 'target' keeps changing, you'll have to continuously adapt to succeed.

I could imagine that at some point the ratio will change, e.g. because encounter cards could be reused in later scenarios to be combined in different ways, making it less important to boost their number compared to new player cards. But for now 50/50 seems ideal to me.

And in conclusion I can only say, I'm looking forward to lots of custom-created scenarios and content for the game. There's so much potential there!

 It's interesting how there's no mention of how many cards there are in each pack. I'm hoping this game focuses on diversity. The APs could very well be 40 cards each, with one of each hero and location, 1-3 of each enemy and attachment.

it says: 60 cards, 3 heroes, 27 new cards and the rest new encounters and quests card

And I quote !

These fixed 60 card decks include a new Hero, three copies of nine unique player cards, and the Encounter and Quest cards devoted to the included scenario.

I guess the scenarios show how to build the encounter decks by showing which enemy 'spheres' to include in the encounter deck for each scenario.

This is what I was thinking, that once you had however many copies of something like "Generic Scary Monster," from adventure pack X, you could use them in the scenario provided further down the road with adventure pack Y, so there would be less of a need for a large number of new encounter cards with each monthly release (< 50%).  This is also assuming that each adventure pack will come with "for this scenario, assemble your encounter deck like this" instructions.  However, this makes me wonder if FFG is looking to make each individual adventure pack a "self contained unit," of sorts, a scenario playable by itself with the addition of the core game.  In that case, it seems unlikely that we would see cards carry over to be used in future adventure packs, and that ratio of about 50% player cards and 50% encounter deck cards may stay about the same.

I think what is maybe most likely (purely a guess on my part, of course), is that we will see adventure pack cards carry over and be usable with future adventure packs within the same cycle, for example, players using the "Hunter from Mordor" cards from Shadows of Mirkwood adventure pack #1 later on in the eventual release of Shadows of Mirkwood adventure pack #6.  Who knows, though.

The art looks beautiful, the cards look great (I wish Call of Cthulhu had the borderless art, too), the packs look interesting. I know a lot of you are looking toward some kind of tournament play, but I'm really more interested in a fun cooperative game with friends. I feel it will succeed at  being a fun game.

I was interested in the game before, but not too excited by it. Not because it didn't look good, but because when I try to prioritize what I'm going to buy it was near the bottom. Now, it's moved up a few spaces.

According to the French fora, in a post by one of the translators for the game, the way the encounter deck is built is through the icons on the enemy/treachery/objective/location cards (middle-right of each card). if you look on side A of each quest card, there are one or more small icons near the bottom-right, as well as one large icon. So, any cards you have in your total pile of enemy cards that have an icon which will match one of the icons on the side A of the quest cards for that adventure should go in the encounter deck. The large icon (a tree in the Passage Through Mirkwood adventure, or an image of Dol Guldur in the Escape from Dol Guldur adventure) indicates the adventure itself, and it matches up with cards that are unique to that adventure (take, as an example, the Shadow Key; its icon is an image of Dol Guldur, and it will hence only be used in that adventure).

It seems odd in the extreme to even think about expansion packs before there's any real evidence that the core set actually exists.

Yer, I'd spotted that too but checking things carefully i think maybe each adventure will be its own self contained unit for a couple of reasons

1. In the example of the key, this gets added to the encounter deck, so as you collect "all" the cards that match the symbols on the first quest card, to prevent dilution problems with the key card, they can't really provide new cards that add to the quest deck going foward.

2. I did think the the orc/goblin encounter cards (The chieftain and Dol Guldor orcs) are examples of those, could be used in a couple of the initial quests (and this still could be the case) including the final adventure in the tower itself, but as the magical stream also has that same icon (a goblins head) and it makes no sense to encounter a stream in a tower, that might not be the case, and so each card may only be used with one specific quest?

3. The description of the expansion packs also says that the encounter cards are "devoted" to the quest. Doesn't neccessarily prevent them being used with other quests from other expansions or the core set, but again they'd need to deal with the card dilution issue somewhere.

The upside of this is that they can make the encounter deck very thematic and really match the quest being played but the downside is that you might get several cards that are effectively the same, but linked to different quests.

I certainly think some cards can be used in more than one quest, even if just from the core set, as otherwise why would they give each quest several different symbols - if the quest had its only set of cards that were only ever used in that quest, they'd only ever be the need for one symbol per quest.

Only time will tell, and perhaps we'll get something in between - perhaps a x number of you orc icon encounter cards and add to the quest deck rather than "all"...? So that they can add cards with the same icon within expansions without causing any card dilution issues

I can't tell about the English version, but the German version of the core set definitely exists! Ask anyone who's been to the Lure of MECCG 2011 last week:

http://www.lureofmeccg.org/ [http://www.lureofmeccg.org/]

The participants have been asked not to spoil anything on international sites (BGG, FFG, etc.), though.

In contrast to the FFG board games the LotR LCG core set will be released in all language versions simultaneously at first printing. Translated versions of board games have to wait until the second printing of the English version.

I think you can easily do a houserule for that. Enemy player draws 8 cards. Plays 1 card for each player on the stage zone (plus additional cards required by some effects). Enemy player plays shadow cards for combat. Enemy player fills up hand to 8.

The variable is the number of cards the Enemy player can hold. More will make it harder for the heroes, less will make it easier.

I think you could probably work something like that but, but if the encounter deck had objective cards - like the key or a clue for gollum, they'd need to be some ruling that prevented the DM keeping those cards in his hand indefinitiely!

 The objective cards of the 3rd scenario went into the staging area before starting. The problem with the objectives is, that when they are in the draw pile, they may be drawn as a shadow card and go into the discard without you having a chance to get them. One of the "boss" orcs in the scenario made objectives go to the draw pile, and man, did we sweat not to draw the card as a shadow card.

Ouch! That's nasty. So, apparently there are other ways to lose the game than reaching a threat rating of 50 or all heroes getting killed.

I got an official news that the 1st Adventure Pack - Hunt For Gollum will be avaliable at the end on May (should be 28th May - but this can change).

## 30 [Karazax on March 17, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42527-of-adventure-to-come-1st-wave-of-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=439450)

 I was really hoping there would be some official scenario creation rules.  I just question the replayability with set scenarios when there is no opponent.  My hope was a system for competitive play for example where you create your own scenario deck, then you play against  your scenario deck, but after the first round you switch scenario decks and play against someone else's.  That would give incentive to make a deck that is hard so that your opponents don't get too many points off it, but not so hard that no one could beat it.  If for example every scenario card had a victory point value, then scenarios could be given a point total that you had to make your scenario deck and then let the players decide how they wanted to reach that point total in the scenario design.  

 

Of course that is a very unpolished example, but it seems that the lack of official scenario rules is a big missed opportunity to make the game more re-playable and greatly increase the deck building options with each adventure pack.  

 

I'm also curious as to how the adventure pack scenarios are going to work together.  Are the adventure pack scenarios going to be completely self sustained between the pack and core set?  Or will they combine cards from different adventure packs, in which case I am curious as to how that will work for players might not have every adventure pack released prior that the scenario requires.

If you look at Pg. 26 of the Rulebook, you'll see that answer to your questions. Each scenario has it's own unique set of encounter cards but then adds in a couple of thematically appropriate Encounter card sets. So the Carrock expansion will have it's special set of Carrock encounter cards but will then probably include the "Wilderlands" set and maybe the "Dol Guldur Orcs" set. It seems like each scenarios specific card are only used for that scenario but then, as said above, will include cards from the broader pool of badguys.
