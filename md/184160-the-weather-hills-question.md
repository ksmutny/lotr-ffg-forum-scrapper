My question is about timing:

 

Is Escort from Edoras still in play when I reveal Angmar Orc from the Orc deck so that I can diacard them as part of the when revealed effect? I guess so, because placing progress tokens and resolving the forced effect of the quest card are still part of resolving the quest...?

Yes, it is still in play. Resolving the quest starts after staging and ends with placing progress. Do note that if you discard your Escort from this effect, its willpower will not be counted when resolving the quest.

But you reveal the cards from the orc deck directly after placing the progress tokens on the active location. So surely the Escort's willpower does count, but is he still in play when I reveal the card from the orc deck, or do I disard him before that? Or does it happen at the same time and I can choose which to resolve first?

Hmmm I believe he would still be in play as you place tokens on the active location first, it is then cleared and you trigger the forced effect of revealing an orc from the orc deck before placing any extra progress on the quest stage and ending the quest phase. Tricky but nice way to cheat the Angmar Orc out of taking an ally down or revealing an additional card, kudos!

Somewhat similarly I love using the Galadriel ally to soak up nasty effects or archery damage during any phase following the quest phase. Her willpower was already counted during questing, her effects already triggered and she is going to get discarded at the end of the round anyway, why not let her soak up some archery for you or be the ally discarded due to a nasty shadow effect or encounter effect while shes at it and provide you with even more of a benefit saving someone else in the process!

The word "after" on the escort seems to indicate that's totaly a legal move.

Wow, cool beans!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I totally didn't plan that move and was quite "well, hmmh...." when the situation occured.

 

Thanks to all three of you!

So wait your saying his will power still counts towards the quest? I would think not cause the Orc causes you to discard him immediately. Never mind I think I see it now. Your past the staging step.

Raven614, we are talking about the case where the staging is over and we are currently placing progress from quest resolution.
