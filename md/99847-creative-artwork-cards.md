This post is an idea tha sure all the fans of LOTR-LCG had got in mind in any moment. A window where you can post (display, show...) your own ideas about any card you have thought up.

It could have got a very good ideas, of course. Came on! (and Caleb, Matthew and company maybe, seeing these ideas, could be prompted :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif] ).

You can post only with the words, or even with an entire 'fanmade' card (click here [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/8458408#8458408]to get the temps of Gecko).

How about, do you like the ideas?

 

PD: Radagast would become a very good ally now :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

 

 

********* HOW TO POST IMAGE CARD FILES **********

 

1. Downloading the templates (click here [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/article/8458408#8458408]to get the temps of Gecko).

2. Working the templates with Photoshop

     - insert the image -there are webs with lots of image arts like deviantart, tumbler, .... searching in google-;

     - add the text you have thought...

     - and -important i think- reduce the size of the template to 500px minimum

3. Upload the image to a server (for example, imageshak)

4. Include the image in your post, by the key 'Image' (insert in the url text the image link that you got in the server in point 3).

I like the pipe. I wonder if repeatable threat reduction shouldn't have more of a limitation. Only usable if the character is ready or something? The wand seems a bit too powerful for 0 cost, but I like the idea for that as well.

Well, if it will be only usable when character is ready, then everyone will use it at the end of the refresh phase and call it a day.

The ability to lower your threat by 1 each turn at no cost should never exist as it will just negate natural threat growth. There should be a catch. Btw it's not unique, if you can muster both hobbit Gandalf and Radagast, then it will be a dope.

The Gandalf hobbit would be free of raise each round... but you need 14 resources and the 4 cards to do it in play (5 gandalf hobbit + 5 radagast + 2+2 pipes)

## 5 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=992644)

Which is pretty easy to come by, especially in multiplayer and/or with new doomed cards.

Another one more, about istari attachments.

I like what you're doing here... make sure to add the "Creature" trait to the Moth!  I agree with Trololo, repeatable -1 threat simply for exhausting an attachment is too powerful since we have at least one Istari that stays in play once paid for.  It needs a higher cost or needs to discard itself... You could increase the threat reduction if you increase the cost, also (not just the resource cost).  Maybe do like Beorn suggested and have it only usable when the character is ready, then make it a Planning action to avoid the simple fix of using it during the Refresh phase.  After all, who smokes a pipe during combat?

Nice ideas for a start!  Here's how I'd work the pipe:

 

2 cost Unique

attach to an Istari character.

exhaust pipe and attached character to reduce your threat by 1.

 

 

make the wand unique, and I think it could maybe stand as it is.

I'm not biting on this one.  Sorry, man.  Good intentions, but in real Tolkien-verse, nobody summons the eagles. (Only Peter Jackson would be so bold...)

Has anyone got any other ideas? Lets go! Post, post , post.... And no only players cards, also encounter cards!...

 

PD: i was thinking the Moth card was incorrect in the thematic way. And finally it was so. But doesn't matter, the important are the ideas, values, costs, traits, text, etc.

I thougt and compared with Galadrim's Greeting (pay 3 for reduce 6 threat)... However, Wizard Pipe only cost one less resource, but it needs 6 rounds to be cheaper than Greetings (almost all good games are closed in the 5th round), and need also the comb with an expensive istari (5 cost). These are the reasons because i didn't see Wizard Pipe too much powerful.

I accepted the challenge and made it even more challenging for me - I started browsing deviant art for LotR artwork, making an oath to make a card out of first good artwork I will encounter. Unfortunately and strangely, most of artwork was fild-related and sucked major balls. But, I stumbled upon picture of Gollum, which reminded me of my Grima-like hope of Smeagol becoming a hero once, so I started browsing the site for the Smeagol art now and here's what happened:

Yeah! Very good idea!!! Smeagol... Really, brilliant idea.

 

Maybe too powerful. He is more powerful even than Imrahil, because Smeagol, in adittion, draws a card. And Imrahil, (in adition!), triggers his hability as a result of one penalty (a character leaves game), so..., i'd add a type of penalty (like: 1 damage to any character..., etc), and reduce his values without reducing his threat level cost (good idea if the character is Gollum). How about?

 

PS: to reduce the image files --> before you save the image and upload it, in photoshop you can reduce the size: for example, if it is 1000pixels high long, reduce to 500px. After, you upload it, and etc.    :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Note: if the images you find in deviantart are lower than the template, no problem, you increase their size, and at the end of the work, you finally reduce the template size (and: here nothing happens! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]).

A few notes: Mark the wording. It's "to", meaning that he needs to be exhausted to trigger his ability. His willpower is not spectacular, and if you happen to commit him to quest and fail to deliver enough progress tokens to the active location - you'll find yourself in a bad situation. The main limiting factor here is locations and your ability to explore them. Thus, leading us to a rich combo potential. Example:

Player quests successfully, with Smeagol being committed to the quest, and gets enough progress to explore active location, readying Smeagol and drawing a card as the result. Then, during the combat phase Smeagol exhausts to attack and Spirfindel exhausts his Asfaloth to epxlore another location currently in staging area(or a new active, doesn't matters), readying Smeagol for another attack and giving himself a card. 

 

As for Imrahil - a character leaving game is not always a penalty. Sneak attacked Gandalf, triggered from hand Bofur, Silvan Refugee who quested with Children of the Sea and etc.

## 15 [Mndela on February 23, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=993166)

Very good idea, of course. I'd lower the attack down to 1. But ...nice, nice! And the quote also.

Lemme explain why I put his attack to 3.

 

I'm not a hardcore fan(if fan at all) of LotR universe, and all my knowledge about it comes from movies, games(including this one), research I did because of those games (like what the hell is Ungoliant) and tales of my friend who read a lot of Tolkiens work. 

 

In the movies, Smeagol killed his friend to get the ring, almost killed Bilbo and Sam, killed a lot of fish and squirrels(lawlz) - he was out there surviving on his own, it's hardened him enough. If you're underwhelmed by his high attack value - I see it coming from unexpected and sudden assaults rather from brute force. That's the thematic reasoning.

 

The gameplay reasoning is Spirit sphere lacks decent fighters. We have a whole bunch of whopping 1 attackers, and a few higher than 1 ones. That's why his willpower is only 2, to make him viable to quest with a bit of risk-reward gameplay perspective and possibility to be useful outside of Quest phase thanks to his attack power.

Here is one more version of him, a bit tweaked. 

 

Toughness X - character with toughness takes X less damage from any source other than undefended attack.

I like the idea of this one but not so much the execution. I think the "Moth" idea would make a better event. Maybe as simply as

 

EVENT - 1 Cost

Action : Put into play a Eagle form your hand.

 

If you wanted to make it OP then have it...

 

EVENT - 1 Cost

Action : Put into play from your hand any amount of Eagles that share the same name.

 

This sorta works as we have Engels are Coming to draw them, and this to play them. I really hate the Istari restriction as well. It is still my solem hope they will not be stupid enough to make a Istari hero.

 

w/e The moth is a good idea for a card.

Lol, Trololo, your last card is Eowyn, you forgot change the name. I was falling in love, but when i saw her name, i returned to love the new blonde silvan is coming in the new adventure (i dont remember her name).

 

Very good idea, if she 'goes' to the battle (commmiting in quest phase), she gets power to fight. Yea! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

 

PD: tomorrow i will post my personal version of... Smeagol of Gollum? I prefer Smeagol name but..., then..., if it is unique and, in the 3rd quest of the Hobbit Saga...one problem: Smeagol and Gollum? Both in play? Mmmmh maybe not bad idea: Smeagol had 2 personalities, but, i think people dont like it.

Really like the artwork and like your idea... I think that the +3 attack would become a tad overpowered and the 4 willpower would probably unbalance the tactics sphere.

For example if you included Theoden and the mounts; Steed of the mark and Rohan warhorse then Eowyn would quest for 5, pay 1 & attack for 4 x 2 (more likely attack for more with a weapon attachment). 

 

In saying that I would really like to see a tactics Eowyn probably with a really powerful a once per game attack response... something like: If a hero (or unique Rohan Character?) leaves play this combat phase then the next attack Eowyn's participates in ignores the enemies defense value and Eowyn uses her Willpower as her attack value... (once per game).

 

Still I'm highly doubtful that a 4 willpower tactics Hero will be released as I think it would mess up the sphere's focus somewhat...

4 willpower tactics hero is what this sphere needs. It will bring them solo tactics capability. 

 

I initally wanted to give her +Willpower to her attack until the end of the round, but WP has a potential to grow a lot so I decided to give her attack to match her Willpower if she foes to the quest. Yes, I agree, it's a bit too high, prolly needs to be lowered to +2.

 

The point is, her bonus is usable only if you intrerfere from outside and ready her for the battle somehow. Steed requires a steady flow of resources to be usable. Many steeds - well, that's quite a draw and resource management you'll need to have there.

## 32 [booored on February 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=993738)

Maybe make her

 

• Eowyn (Tactics)

9 Threat / 1 Will  / 3 Attack

When Eowyn is committed to the quest add her [ATK] to her [WIL]

 

?

 

• Eowyn (Tactics)

9 Threat / 1 Will  / 1 Attack

When Eowyn is committed to the quest add 3 to her [WILL].

When Eowyn is ready add 2 to her [ATK]

 

?

My Eowyn needs to quest to get her attack up, which forces player to find means to ready her for the combat phase to use her attack. This creates gameplay situations, which is good and kinda the point.

## 34 [booored on February 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=993756)

yeah these options retains that exact functionality but doesn't make her more powerful than every other card in the game. 4 attack, 4 will for 9 threat is to strong, I think they are a good compromise while retaining the choice between questing and attacking as well as allowing untap effects to power both stats.

## 35 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=993766)

I have already said that +3 should be raplaced with +2(and actually updated the image).

 

With your first variant, Eowyn can just skip quest to perfrom an attack with a full power. Technically, she is just a 4 will 3 attack until you bump her with attack attachments, and when you do - it's just a flat stat growth.

 

Your second variant is counter intuitive and hardly usable. Stat bonus which works only while character is ready - you need to ready her after she is declared as an attacker to get her attack bumped, meaning her next exhaustion will be in vain.

It certainly would make more quests accessible for soloing Tactics.

I would keep her the way she is (with the +2 boost) but maybe lower her willpower to three. That way her 9 threat is more of an average of what her stats can be. Also this makes "only" 4 willpower with Theoden in play, which I think works better thematically. Also, if we left her at 4 base willpower, she'd have 5 with Theoden around, which is pretty ridiculous, especially for Tactics.

## 38 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 24, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=994003)

If you use Theoden to boost her to 5 - well, good for you, as tactcs sphere lacks any kind of mid/lategame questing power, you'll find even that 5 lacking soon enough(if you go mono tactics). It's Theoden's ability in work after all, why should you degrade one character because it can be booster by another?

About threat, lets refer to our newcomer Eomer. He get's +2 Attack after a character leaves play. Does any of his base stats is diminished because of this? No. And, unlike Eowyn, he can utilize this stat without help from the side(readying mechanics).

Here's a card I came up with a while ago:
 

Shadowfax.jpg?dl=1&token_hash=AAEGRKl3KF [https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/xnd8oqd8waez8o4/Shadowfax.jpg?dl=1&amp;token_hash=AAEGRKl3KFwYfgQHxFOTc8QdtukBXZelwSGxgvnZgTDDEg]

 

He essentially serves the purpose of getting Gandalf where he needs to be quicker by bringing him into play quicker (making him cheaper) and bringing his aid to help defend against an attack (by adding his defense to a defender).

 

The other real thematic possibilities for mounts involve either readying or location control, but there's enough of that. I wanted to do something new. Something that would be especially good for Gandalf. Adding 4 defense to a character is a huge boost, but it comes at the cost of exhausting Gandalf. This isn't a huge deal since you are likely using the Hobbit Gandalf if you're using this card, so you can still quest (since he doesn't exhaust to quest), and if you end up not needing Gandalf to help with defending, he is then available to lend his 4 attack to help destroy enemies.

 

This card essentially just makes Gandalf more versatile by giving the option to allow Gandalf to help with defending, rather than by defending alone. This can make Gandalf a very powerful card in Hobbit decks where you have Frodo as the defender, but you want to keep your threat within secrecy range, so you give Frodo more defense so he receives less damage.

 

Also note that the defense boost lasts until the end of the phase, so if the defender has readying effects, he has the boost for multiple attacks.

 

-----

 

In case the image fails to load, here's the card as text:

 

Cost: 1
Neutral Attachment

Mount. Noble.

 

Attach to Gandalf or put into play unattached.

 

Forced: After Shadowfax is put into play unattached, play Gandalf from your hand for 2 fewer resources than his printed cost or discard Shadowfax.

 

Response: After a character is declared as a defender, exhaust Shadowfax and attached Gandalf to add Gandalf’s defense to that character until the end of the phase.

> If you use Theoden to boost her to 5 - well, good for you, as tactcs sphere lacks any kind of mid/lategame questing power, you'll find even that 5 lacking soon enough(if you go mono tactics). It's Theoden's ability in work after all, why should you degrade one character because it can be booster by another?

Well, I guess I'd put her down to 3 willpower with 8 threat then. I just don't feel that having a character with 4 base willpower belongs in the Tactics sphere. Sure Tactics could use some help in the questing department, but Theoden (boosted to 3WP) + 4WP Tactics Eowyn (boosted to 5WP) + any other 2WP Tactics hero (boosted to 3WP) or any 3WP hero would be a higher starting willpower than any other combination of heroes currently available in the game. A deck with 67-100% Tactics should not be the strongest questing deck (hero-wise) in the game. It's not their niche.

 

3/1/1/3 with a +2(or 3) boost to attack is still a pretty darn good hero.

There is one unspoken rule in LotR LCG - heroes don't lose/gain stats when they swap spheres. 

I don't understand your unhealthy urge to lower her willpower. Eowyn's willpower is her mark in this game. 

 

As for starting willpower, Spirit Eowyn has 4(+1 per player potential) wp, Elrond, Sam and Thorin got 3 wp and guess what? It's their base wp, without any boosts. And guess what else? Their abilities are not wasted on just giving willpower to the party. 

 

The very purpose of Theoden is to make tactics into questiong, and I see no problem in doing so as most quests strike you with heavy threat and this early willpower surge is a compensation for total lack of willpower in allies later in the game - it simply won't grow past that.

For me, releasing a super low threat hero in a sphere that as the hightest threat mean and without any threat reduction should kill the purpose more than a 3-willpower hero that boost willpower of other...

I guess you're right. I have no problem with Tactics having decent-questing heroes... I just feel like they shouldn't have the strongest set of questing heroes in the game. At least with Tactics, you need pretty high threat to have that much questing power (Eowyn for 9, Theoden for 12, plus another), though if you throw in Glorfindel, Merry, or Sam, you can still start below 30.

Laugh - very good... well and i'm less sure but still doubtful that they would include ANOTHER one with 4 will power... unless the plan is to make red the new blue... maybe next up is a Spirit Boromir that readies and gets +1 attack every time you lower your threat ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Interesting idea. I find it an intriguing strategy. Oddly enough, some When Revealed effects can actually give you a boost to your questing. You also need to be careful, though, because if you try to maximize his Willpower, then you are more susceptible to those same effects.

Finally, my Smeagol version:

 

ryak.jpg [http://imageshack.com/a/img41/1471/ryak.jpg]

 

He is leadership because he is the guide to Mordor.

He has a high threat cost (more than his values) because he is bad (he is Gollum), but when you are playing with Sam and Frodo he becomes good (Smeagol) and his threat is 0. Frodo + Sam + Smeagol (like the history) = 7+8+0 = 15. The best secrecy deck with 3 heroes!!! In fact, they are the best secrecy team: the travel to mordor far of the Sauron Sight. A think it is a very good idea. (If Sam or Frodo leaves game, Smeagol returns to his original threat -he becomes Gollum, bad guy, like some moments in the film-)

I keep the response of Trololo, only limit the location: it must be the active one. (If not, i think it is very powered). But it was a very good idea.

There should be something to clarify that you gain 10 threat after one of them leaves play. And lose 10 threat when you are back to having both heroes again. This would be an interesting bounce back and forth in the LotR saga boxes when Frodo is always with the first player.

I really like the theme of having all three be in secrecy. I would make Gollum/Smeagol lore though cuz a guide is different from a leader. A guide shows you things that they know and that you don't versus a leader who takes command. I'd hate to have to make it a tri-sphere deck though.

The Eowyn issue is interesting. I've been waiting eagerly for the Witch-king slaying, Tactics version of Eowyn to arrive, but the issue about bringing in a high willpower hero to the sphere is well-taken, and I do think there is a substantial sphere balance issue there. Either the designers would have to break their pattern of not changing stats when heroes change spheres or they would have to include some limitation or drawback that balances out Eowyn's willpower.

 

Thematically, Eowyn only was able to ride to battle by hiding her identity and not "questing" openly. So maybe some type of drawback ability (like Spirit Glorfindel's) to represent her need to hide her identity would be fitting and would help balance adding a high willpower hero to Tactics.

If she would have a drawback, then her starting threat need to be significantly lower than 9 or something. Drawbacks are given when heroes overperforms the usual.

Can you shed some thoughts on why you think Caleb of Pelargir is overpowered? He costs a hefty 4 to play, has medicore stats block, is unique and his ability is limited to once per turn by player and is a major resource sink.

Thematically I tried to portray a veteran sellsword, different players paying him to get his service from time to time.

 

You can't imagine how hard was to come by any fitting thug art around the internet. I'm happy that I have found this one, a familliar face.

 

Prolonged exploration takes your progress from quest, costs 2 and does not guarantees everybody a free card. It's also restricted to the travel phase.

 

I can't see how Mithradil Advice and Things Long Forgotten is a combo. Both are card draws but from different sources. And TLF requires quite a setup to draw more. I can see how TLF can be comboed with those event-returning attachments introduced in the Against the Shadow cycle.

Caleb of Pelargir is like the dunedain attachments, but as an ally, so more independent. Once he has been played, he is very powerfull. He is like X (number of players) rohan horses but in the moment you want.

 

Lol, i know how hard is searching for images. I have made some fanmades, one of them with 32 diferent cards. I know, believe me.

 

Ok, Prolonged Explorations is not overpowered, for a moment i forgot the condition of getting progress tokens on the quest card and placing on the active location. Very original idea. Nice.

 

Agh, sorry: my mistake, i was wrong: i wanted to say Scroll of Isildur. (I was wrong because i usually use Mithrandil Advice with Scroll of Isildur). The combo would be: you use MAdvice (in a monolore), you return by SIsildur, and you return to get MAdvice by TLF. And if you have other SI... uf! Half deck is drawn.

## 67 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 25, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=996035)

The combo you described will require 3 resources. In a monolore, you don't have any sources of resource gain so you have 3 resources to spend per turn. Not so broken, after all.

Mmmmh, ok. Not so broken, but... if other friend give to you resources (errand rider, stewards...) It is true that you are needing lots of cards to build the combo, but... if that card were released... too riskly. Dificult get the combo, but possible finally.

I love all of these, though....

- Caleb can be pretty dang powerful. He can be essentially an additional 2 willpower per player. One player commits him, then the next player "buys" him and commits him, then the next player... I wouldn't say overpowered, since there is still a decent cost to do this, but certainly still a powerful card.

- I might say to remove the "Draw 1 additional card..." bit from Things Long Forgotten, but most of the time, you won't be playing more than 2 copies of it per game, so it's not overly powerful.

 

Many of your cards seem to be right on the brink of being potentially too powerful, but never really crossing that line. Good job.

All of the cards posted on this Page 4 are pretty darn interesting cards. I'm not sure how many decks I'd use most of them in, but these cards certainly bring some interesting strategies together.

 

I was thinking that in order to synergize with most of these thugs, you could just have a card with something like:

 

Response: After a player spends a resource to satisfy the requirement of an ability on an ally, .... do something.

 

What it does would largely depend on which sphere the card with the ability is in. I was thinking maybe something like:

 

Some Guy (unique)
Tactics Hero

 

8 Threat

1 Willpower

2 Attack

2 Defense

3 Hit Points

 

Gondor. Thug. Warrior.

 

Response: After a player spends a resource to satisfy the requirement of an ability on an ally, Some Guy gains +1 Attack until the end of the round. (Limit 3 times per round)

 

What do you think?

A Thug event:

 

o8ec.jpg [http://imageshack.com/a/img547/840/o8ec.jpg]

 

I'd do the thug trait as a leadership (some of last thug allies not to be neutral, maybe leadership). Because tactics has his own: eagles; spirit: rohan (Mustering Rohirrim); and lore trackers. And leadership? Gondor?... no, lots of characters are gondor and from other spheres...so: thug! Yeah!

Isn't top 15 cards of the deck is too big?

Eagle search searched top 5 and added EVERY eagle to the hand. Mustering added one from the top 10 cards and costed 1. 

This adds one from 15 and costs 0.

Yes, but you must exhaust one thug character as a condition. And i think you dont have (at least at the moment) lots of thug characters in your deck, and the idea is can chose the thug character you want/need.

 

Ok, maybe the cost would be: 1 resource and exhaust one thug character. (But then..., 20 top cards if able :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] )

## 80 [MyNeighbourTrololo on February 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=996500)

20 cards would be half of the deck by the time you use this card. Just think of it.

 

Also, I got a couple of interesting ideas about Thug events. Still thinking about Thug hero.

Makes little thematical sense to me that dagger damages enemies engaged with another player =O 

Also, it says Tugh Dagger in the text.

Text fixed.

 

The dagger damaging another enemies..., i love this idea, is like a backstab.

 

Yes, the idea of Thug Ambush is, yes, forever. Leadership can do it, for it is leadership. Parting Gifts is a little similar, you can get the resources of other player to yourselve (with the limitation that the source must be leadership, but here it not matters the source).

Isn't giving away your allies forever is a bit harsh? Other player may not have the possibility to give them back. If it's forever for real, why the "Limit once per phase"? And, by the way, by the card text, it gives control of all Thug allies in play to another player, not just ones you control.

Lol, yes all they were the original idea. With 2 copies of it, you can change the controller.

 

But ok, maybe change: 1 cost and only allies you control (and quit out 'limited once per phase', of course, useless now)

 

PD: i was thinking about 1 or 2 hability thug allies can change controller paying by the controller, so that even hadn't a forever effect.

To search for thug images in the web is difficult, but i will try to find any and build an entire card from your ideas. Can i?

 

Shadowy contractor: maybe too powered, i'd limit his action..., mabye exhaust him in adition, or only once per game. How about?

## 98 [Distractionbeast on February 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=996882)

Thanks!  I've done some custom card designs, but I don't have time or tools to do it at the moment.  I think this thug-related string of posts inspired me to throw out some new ideas.

 

BTW, my thinking on the contractor was that if Outlands can have a spend X to retrieve X, a card swap once per turn shouldn't be too bad.  You'd have to have reliable card draw to make it worthwhile, and you'd still spend the cost to play the card. Hama has a similar effect and arguably tactics events are more potent individually.  None of the proposed thug cards are gamebreaking really (minus the first iteration of Caleb!).

I find that all neutral thug event should be better with "cannot be paid with non-gondor or non-thug hero" thus creating something like a fifth sphere. For allies, they are mercenary so no problem, but those event are quite thug-oriented and I don't expect Elrond to pay for those shenanigans...

I'll probably give most of the Thugs spheres, add some more thugs to make their count even among the spheres, will give it a big good dam thought to balance them out, add some events and attachments too. And a Spirit Thug hero ofcourse. And then I'll make an OCTGN set with all of this to test it out in actual gameplay.

 

Here's what I think...

 

Allies:

Spirit: Silent Watcher, Whisper;

Lore: The Owl, 1 more non-unique thug;

Tactics: 1 unique and 1 non-unqiue thug;

Leadership: Harbor Mercenary, 1 more unique thug;

Neutral: Pelargir Tough, Caleb of Pelargir.

 

Events:

Spirit: Laying Low;

Lore: will be added;

Tactis: Dirty Trick;

Leadership: Cunning Scheme;

Neutral: Ambush!

 

...hm, Dirty Trick looks a bit unspectacular compaed to all other spheres. I'll probably move him to Neutral(so thre'll be 2 neutral events) and add something more vague to the tactics there.

I think, one thug-related event is enough for each sphere(except for neutral, as I can see now). Making attachments for each sphere will be hard.

Here's a hero I whipped up:

8g1r.jpg [http://imageshack.com/a/img849/8021/8g1r.jpg]
(Figured out the size issue)  He's a neutral hero, so he can only spend resources on neutral cards. That's why I gave him the "can pay for thugs" ability.  Strength in numbers for the second ability. The thugs would get more bold once they have a better chance of winning. The action is just for when you need it. He's kind of an all-arounder type guy. Is he too overpowered? I tried to give him low stats to compensate for that. 

Also, here's a non-thug dude that I wished they would have incorporated somehow, to help Boromir's ability out:

Very nice ideas...good work at all.

But this card would be much to strong...

You only need Song of Earendil or a Wandering Took and you decrease your threat very easy...therefore the hobbit-pipe is restricted to events.

Erkenbrand has always been one of my favorite "side" heroes in the LotR books. I came up with this concept to try and do a couple of things: 

 

 1. Give those poor Snowbourne Scouts something useful to do, other than die in combat. 
 2. Add a little twist to "monosphere" decks using Rohan heroes (e.g., you could technicially "monosphere" with Eowyn, Dunhere, and this version of Erkenbrand, or do Theoden, Hama / Eomer, and Erkenbrand). 

Let me know what you think . . . too overpowered? Just right?

A couple more entries to this thread:

 

1. Anborn - I know there's an ally version of Anborn already, but he seems to be ready-made to have a hero version as well. Someone else (Feonix, maybe?) had created an Anborn hero with Spirit as his sphere of influence, but I HATED WITH A PASSION the artwork they chose for him. They used some concept artwork from Diablo II or Diablo III, I can't remember . . . and it was totally wrong for the vibe of the LOTR LCG. Plus, the special power they'd given him was basically identical to Asfaloth, and I didn't think it was very cool to duplicate player card effects using a hero. 

 

So, I wanted to revamp him into something I liked.

The idea behind this is similar to Erkenbrand, where it adds a little bit of flexibility for Gondorian Spearmen and Rammas Defenders in those dire cases where you just need to get an active location completed. 

 

 

 

2. Stuff for Elladan and Elrohir

 

The twins are by far my favorite characters in this game. I love the concept of the synergies they generate for each other, plus the fact that simply put, they have the ability to "break" the action economy right out of the gate through the use of resources. 

 

However, I'm tired of having a thematically inappropriate reason to keep adding Steward of Gondor to my decks (because Elrohir + Steward of Gondor = Amazing Defender).

 

So I came up with a couple of item concepts for them.

 

gondolin-shield-sm.png [https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-I8Ek10uzu-E/UycTNIAFVwI/AAAAAAAAANY/wtKMN-yGBsM/w300-h422-no/gondolin-shield-sm.png]

I thought long and hard about adding the "increase threat to ready" feature of Out Upon Errantry, simply because I felt it could easily be abused with Beravor. But then I realized, that the either/or nature of the card means you're never getting an extra resource, AND getting to ready a Dunedain or Ranger character. I could theoretically see the argument to increase the threat cost for readying to 2, but to me I think the card's "power level" is just about right as is, at least compared to its closest analogue, Steward of Gondor. 

 

The shield was really just an excuse to stop stuffing Gondorian Shield into my decks (because once again, Elrohir + Steward of Gondor + Gondorian Shield = UBER!!!). Plus, I think the threat cancellation effect for Orcs and Mordor enemies is pretty thematically appropriate. Yeah, it sort of makes Burning Brand obsolete, but I like the fact that it requires spending a token to use as a balancing effect.

Okay, seriously . . . we HAVE to have some kind of condition-remover that ISN'T A STINKING DWARF CARD (or requires the VoI expansion). 

 

So here's mine. Yes, it's been done previously in various iterations at Hall of Beorn. But as always, mine's the best.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I tried to Photoshop it a little bit to make it not so obviously a screen capture from the film. I guess it sort of / kind of works, but really this needs a true artist's rendition.

Hmmm, I'm trying to picture the result of this card, Mndela. So, if you don't like the shadow effect on the card, you swap it with the shadow card (unrevealed) of another engaged enemy? 

 

That's interesting . . . there's some definite applications for this.

 

I wonder if changing the cost to 1, and adding the Outlands trait to the effect would work? 

## 131 [Mndela on March 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1029844)

For example, you and another friend, are in combat phase.

 

6lNUhDm.png [http://i.imgur.com/6lNUhDm.png]

 

Theoden defends first one enemy...., and the shadow is bad for you (Theoden would die)

 

qHo9Rp5.png [http://i.imgur.com/qHo9Rp5.png]

 

So you can use this event to change shadow cards:

 

JfYoSFa.png [http://i.imgur.com/JfYoSFa.png]

 

By this way, in adittion, you save the other defender because you know the shadow and how to defend.

Next shadow: goodluck, no effect... So you save Theoden and not bad surprises for the other attack, Denethor can defends.

 

LhhT2af.png [http://i.imgur.com/LhhT2af.png]

 

ioqaVrB.png [http://i.imgur.com/ioqaVrB.png]

 

And, one time is all defended, time to attack:

 

Z6StCq2.png [http://i.imgur.com/Z6StCq2.png]

 

PD: i forgot damage Theoden ^^

PD2: the name of the event, 'Know no fear' makes sense. You dont have fear about one more 'unknowed' shadow cards, so you dare to get another one diferent. It has lots of good effects, for example, save the defender...  and, in adittion, when you know you can save your defender (for example, with Burning Brand), you can use this event to save other defender (because you will know the respective shadow card).

There are actually some pretty cool combos you can do for this too:

- In two player games, if the other deck is a hobbit deck, you can set up Small Target

- With Hama, you can use this every round... assuming there are at least two enemies to deal with each round.

- Can swap the shadow to a defender who is wearing A Burning Brand

 

Sadly some nice combos don't actually work with the way this is worded:

- In two player games where the other player is using Silver lamp, you can't swap with their shadow effects because your card specifies it must be swapped with an unrevealed shadow card. Could reword the card though :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes, true. Good ideas. Thanks for them.

 

Tha's true, with Silver Lamp it must be reworded to be valid with it.

Another entry:
 

Been thinking for a new hero that is very thematic and not overpowered. Came up with this version of Tom Bombadil. He isn't very powerful to take with you on the quest but he can for sure make a difference, just as in the actual story. As always he just wanders around singing all happy jingles. So therefore also his text and abilities in the same spirit:

I hope the lore 1 is a joke ;-).She quests 8 easily every round. Play Beravor and all card draws and your settled. The leadership might be ok. But also think she's overpowered. Rohans quest mega allready. So no need to empower that one.

## 137 [MyNeighbourTrololo on April 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1036682)

It's obviously nothing serious, as it labeled with "boredom entertainment presents", but for the sake of the arguement - if you're gonna keep all the cards in your hand to quest - what will you do with the attackers?

## 138 [Jban on April 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1037069)

You start with 7 cards, Beravor makes it 9 , so you have 9 in round 1. Next round you'll have 11 (9 -  1 + 3 ), then 13,15,....

And this is just assumed you keep all in hand. Suppose you dont and you want to quest 8 every round. You can play 2 on average every round (Beravor gets 2, new round gets 1, Eowyn loses 1) . If you also play mithrandirs advice, or gleowine, expert-treausre hunter, lorien wealth or master of the forge. You can play sufficient amount of cards at no extra cost. with the massive 8 willpower every round by just 2 heroes.

Seems overpowered to me. ;-)

yes, this is the idea. It forces to you to play ranged, with multiplayer. And you must 'prepare' an enemy, if enemy has more than 3 points to be killed, to gain the resource (for example, with direct damage events, or in 2 rounds, or with snare...). Not easy, if not, this ally would be overpowered, everybody would add him in his deck instead Horse Archer.

I've been really excited by the upcoming Silvan support, so I thought I'd speculate on the new Silvan hero.  I know people have said it'll be a hero version of Haldir, but personally I'd be much happier if we got Orophin (Haldir's other brother) that way we can still use the Haldir ally.

 

So here's my stab at a Silvan Spirit hero, Orophin

A wanted a kind of weapon or damaging trap, like a dagger, but i didnt found nothing in the web ^^.

 

Sword, well, light sword, is good for arrow it to an enemy, i imagine that the enemy is hurted by it and can't fight in his 100% strong power.

 

 

Another idea could be: the dunedain character is waiting behind a tree (or another place ^^), and when he sees an enemy and wants to damage to him, he does..., and enemy is hurted. But dunedain uses his ability, and cant return to be hidden in the same place (so he loss the attachment).

Anoter card more:

 

7daXD69.jpg [http://i.imgur.com/7daXD69.jpg]

 

It is similar than Frodo (Black Riders), but without dark power, only using the lore ability (intelligence and technical :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]). The diference is this card can't avoid the traits neither the 'when revealed' effects. But anyway, it is powerful to avoid bad enemies and locations, his cost is 2.

So, I went a bit crazy this week coming up with new card concepts. Anyway, see what you think.

## 177 [FeloniusBard on May 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1100734)

Overall, I really like the cards I just posted, but I'm having a tiny bit of trouble deciding something for Spirit Faramir. 

 

I'm wondering if his ability would be too powerful if it read, "Limit once per quest card," instead of "Limit once per game." I'm thinking that if I left the "Limit once per game," I might change the text to read "All characters" instead of "All heroes." 

 

Also, I really, really want some help with Spirit Elladan. Having played an Elladan/Elrohir/Loragorn deck almost exclusively for about 4 months now, I'm finally realizing that it's just a nearly impossible combo to play properly. I really like the concept I've created for Lore Elrohir, I think I'd almost permanently change him out for Leadership Elrohir. But I just can't wrap my head around a good concept for Spirit Elladan. 

 

This idea was to keep the basic "flavor" of his original mechanic, where he pays resources to activate additional actions. But the use case of readying following a treachery is not as universal as the original Elladan multiple-attack synergy. So I added the condition cancellation as a secondary effect. But I'm not sure I'm happy with either. 

 

What's are some good, thematic, balanced abilities that could be used with Spirit Elladan? 

## 178 [Mndela on May 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1100894)

Faramir: maybe add another kind of limitation like discard an ally in play to... I think one per game is poor, and one per round is overpowered. Instead, if you must pay resources, discard cards or discard something in play could be correct.

Elrohir: i dont like, simply. Too dificult to reach the good effect of his ability. Isn'?

Elladan: not bad, good abilities. Why not?

## 179 [FeloniusBard on May 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1101196)

For Faramir, the idea was that I wanted it to be a major "game changing" ability, similar to Lore Aragorn. You get to do it once, but it's a significant, dramatic effect. I thought of changing it to read "All characters" instead of "All heroes." Late in the game, it could become a huge game-changer. 

 

The other option is to leave it as "All heroes," but add an additional cost.

 

For example: 

 1. "Spend 2 resources from Faramir's resource pool"
 2. "Discard 2 cards from the Spirit Sphere of Influence from your hand.

Then change the usage limit to "Once per quest stage" (i.e., once for stage 1b, once for 2b, once for 3b, etc.).

 

Thinking about it, I like the "Discard 2 Spirit cards from your hand" to activate the effect. It makes a nice either / or decision for the player. 

 

All in all though, I like the basic concept for Spirit Faramir vastly better than the original. It's way more thematically appropriate, since in the books his very presence in battle inspired his followers. 

 

The more I thought about Elladan, the more I think you're right; it seems like a decent set of abilities. His readying ability also makes a great synergy with Eleanor. 

 

For Elrohir you think his ability is a little bit UNDER-powered? Hmmm. That's interesting.

 

Again, the idea from the original twins was that they get to spend resource tokens to gain additional circumstantial actions. 

 

Maybe something like, "Refresh Action: If Elrohir defended an attack this round, pay a resource token from his resource pool to draw an additional card. Pay an additional token for each point of damage on Elrohir to activate this effect." 

 

That way if he does take damage during combat, you have an action window to heal him first. This also synergizes nicely with healing cards like Nimrodel, Warden of Healing, Self-preservation, etc. Yes, actually, that's way more elegant, and easy to understand.

What is the shieldarm supposed to do? The timing of the phases means he would be ready for the end of turn only?

Oh yeah of course. I was thinking too rigidly about phases. Makes sense, I like the card a lot now that I get it.

## 183 [PsychoRocka on May 29, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1101536)

yeah its a cool mechanic!
 

An ally that gets an attack or defense boost if it participates in defending/attacking with a Hero might be a cool idea?

For example:
 

Cost: 3 Sphere: Tactics

Silvan Blademaster

Willpower: 1

Attack: 2

Defense: 1

Health: 2

Silvan Warrior may be declared as an additional defender for any one attack a hero has been declared the defender for.
When defending an attack with a hero, if neither the blademaster or the hero take damage as a result of that attack deal 1 damage to the attacking enemy.

When Silvan Blademaster participates in an attack with a hero it gets +1 attack until the end of the round.

 

My rules text is horribly worded and it seems slightly overpowered...... still a cool idea though.

Yeah, the shieldarm is simulating the idea that he defends first, keeping a foe at bay, while someone else swoops in for the kill. Once the engaged foe is handled, the shieldarm is ready to aid in a counter-attack.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I like the design, but why would a "Forced" effect use optional engagement? Why not just "Jumper Goblin engages the first player"? Would a disctinction affect gameplay?

## 194 [monkeyrama on July 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1160636)

 If the wording is altered slightly, then it means that the first player is forced to use their optional engagement on that specific goblin. Which is rather clever.

## 195 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1160738)

Rather clever, but wording is bad. 

 

Should be something like:

"Forced: When faced with an option to optionally engage an enemy, first player must engage Jumper Goblin, if able."

 

"If able" is added because if there would be two jumper goblins in play at one time, first player won't be able to optionally engage both of them because he has only one optional engagement per turn.

trololo, i laughted a lot when i thouht how so happy Tavern Regulars would become when a song is played (all they singing with a beer in hand ^^), very good idea. Librarian and Silvan maybe so much over-powered, isn't? The event is amazing idea!!!

 

Very interesting the time keyword on the player cards. I have built one:

I don't think it's overpowered. Note that time tokens do not refill themselves, so once time effect is triggered - it's not going to trigger again. And time is a very essential things in LotR.

## 205 [Mndela on July 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1177167)

For example, Librarian has 2wp. Which other ally lore sphere has with 2wp paying 2 resources for it? And in adittion, it gives to you 2 cards with time effect (2 times, so we could see like: it gives to a player 1 card per round, like gleowine --> Librarian is Gleowine + 2wp, you can quit out Gleowine for ever in that case).

 

PD: the Silvan ally can't trigger his passive text, because when the last time counter is out it returns to his original time counters. So never it has 0.

PD: our cards must reads in adittion: 'immune to encounter cards time effects' (there are treacheries that quit out time tokens ^^)

## 206 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 31, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1177576)

Librarian has 1 hp and no other stat. He costs 2 because his effect is delayed by two turns, and with that hp of his he might die before it even triggered. Make him cost 3 and he becomes worthless. Gleowine provides constant card draw to whoever needs it, right from the point where you played him. And he will do it forever. Librarian is just 2 cards after 2 turns of wait. 

 

PD: Nope, time counters are not refilled automatically, there should be text for it. Look:

I should have made a note on that. Was tossing around ideas as the focus of them is to all be used by one player for a deck but not tri sphere it.

 

Working on details of the bonus they get for all being used by 1 player in the war in the north campaign. Will be updated in a bit

 

When not used they will just get a single sphere.

 

Eradin will be Lore

The "free of encounters" seems to be only used on "Guarded" cards. It might be best to have a response/forced, like:

 

"Response: after attached location is explored, first player gains control of Lost Traveler."

 

Great concept though. It's always fun to see inventive ways of getting cards into play for cheap without just making them cheap.

Just thought of this. Gondor decks often seem to be about ally swarms to make use of the Visionary Leadership and Leadership Boromir's boosts, so I figured I'd make a Gondorian ally that sorta depends on ally mustering. The sorta interesting part is that if you have guys sitting around doing nothing that have 0 attack, this guys essentially gives them 1 attack if they participate in an attack with him. His boost also scales well with additional copies of Gondorian Soldier. I kinda feel like Outlands should work more like this, but that's kinda difficult to achieve with the HP and Defense boosts.

Yea, i was thinking about giving more utility to cards we already have in the pool. There are a lot of cards that already exist that might not get used, or are used sparingly due to their low stats. This allows them to provide at least 1 attack, even if they normally don't have any attack. Citadel Custodian is a great example and this card even allows him to come into play for cheaper. Even Imladris Stargazer. Sometimes you're already set and don't need to look at or rearrange your top cards since you just did it last turn. This gives her more purpose. Minas Tirith Lampwright is another great example. He sits around doing nothing until a card with surge pops up. Now he can do more than that when nothing shows up. Granted, Visionary Leadership and Leadership Boromir can make him more useful too, but those abilities can't always be active.

 

Don't get me wrong, Fate Drench is great and I love introducing new factions and such, but I have great respect for new cards that give current underutilized cards new life.

I secretly hope that there'll be something that boosts stats of Dunedain Watcher in the upcoming cycle. Well, not so secretly now.

## 222 [joezim007 on September 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1248478)

Yea, but Dunedain seems to be an aggressive deck type that favors engaging enemies, so that makes me think that cancelling shadows will end up being very important (unless they also get more ways to avoid defending). In that case, I'd favor finding a way to make Dunedain Watcher cheaper rather than stronger, because her ability is more important than her stats and I don't want to pay 3 resources to end up discarding her on the first turn, which makes her stats largely pointless.

I have the card ideas, that is the title and concept, and have a few pieces of art, but I want someone (preferably you Trololo) to come up with the text. I know you're a supporter of the Palantir card we already have, but I would like if you could create a couple new unique Palantiri, namely the Palantir of Orthanc and Palantir of Minas Tirith. The only condition is that they should be neutral attachments, and while I do have the templates I trust you to come up with a balanced and creative ability for each of them. If you want, of course.

Here is the first part of Gizlivadi's request. Sorry, the art you provided looked awkward on the attachment window to me, so I googled and found this piece (told'ya, I'm picky bout the art I put on the cards  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] ). As for the card text, I decided to took a slightly different approach of a raw power with a possibility to pay the ultimate price for it, while being simple.

How about after failing the quest, the attached hero loses 2 willpower. When the attached hero has 0 willpower he must be discarded.

## 231 [MyNeighbourTrololo on September 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1250511)

Too harsh price for being able to quest standingly, at least for me. Card is already unique, takes up a restricted slot, requires a hero to be noble and damages him by the amount of failed questing. Discarding a hero just because you lost a quest must bring some powerful benefit to the table in the first place.

## 232 [Gizlivadi on September 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1250525)

That's great Trololo! Also that's a good art choice. I had already seen that one and I thought it looked a bit too evil for my taste but it looks pretty good on the finished card. Also it's FFG artwork so it fits. Now as for the card itself, themewise I don't know how a Palantir can make a hero not exhaust to quest, so that's a bit odd, but the effect itself is quite balanced and it's definately something I'd use in a deck. The only change I would give it is "Attach to a Noble or Istari hero", now that we got Gandalf hero.

## 233 [Gizlivadi on September 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1250530)

And I think a better wording would be "After players quest unsuccessfully, attached hero takes X damage, where X is the total threat in the staging are minus the total willpower of all committed characters."

## 234 [FetaCheese on September 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1250577)

This seems too much like a slippery slope card that would encourge power gaming, so to speak, because if you quest successfully, you have a massive gain in action economy and if you fail, even once, you cripple your usually best quester. The effects are a bit too dramatic imo.

## 235 [joezim007 on September 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1250845)

> Too harsh price for being able to quest standingly, at least for me. Card is already unique, takes up a restricted slot, requires a hero to be noble and damages him by the amount of failed questing. Discarding a hero just because you lost a quest must bring some powerful benefit to the table in the first place.

 

Either effect can slowly lead to the death of the hero. My version is more thematic because if questing goes wrong, you lose willpower instead of hit points. Denethor lost his will and courage, not his physical health, from using a Palantir. You can also boost your willpower with Favor of the Lady, Dunedain Quest, Celebrian's Stone, and Sword that was Broken. This can give you a huge willpower pool, essentially making it so that the hero is guaranteed not to die. In either case, if you attach this to a hero with at least 3 willpower, the likeliness of the hero dying in a fame is probably pretty close to the same.

 

Now, let's compare this card to Light of Valinor, which is probably its closest match.

 

Both Unique, both cost 1 and both have the same positive effect. The Noble keyword is far more common than Noldor or Silvan on heroes (more 3x as many Noble heroes), which gives the Palantir the upper hand. The palantir is also neutral, which once again makes it better. The "restricted" keyword is a good way to add balance, though it's not extremely painful because questers don't tend to get many other restricted attachments anyway. Then, of course, it's forced effect gives it the potential to be far worse than Light of Valinor, but considering its passive ability, there's a decent chance this negative effect will ever rear its head, especially combined with Light of Valinor on another hero.

 

If you use both cards, you can easily get 6+ willpower each quest phase for "free", which makes it pretty easy to avoid this negative effect. This makes me think that having the -2 willpower effect is more balanced than the damaging effect, but moreso, I just don't think we should have any more attachments that allow you to quest for free.

 

I know I got a bit nitpicky here. I hope no one takes it personally. These are just my opinions, and I still like the card as it is, but I don't think it'd go well in our current card pool and I think it needed a bit more downside and theme.

I'll trust Trololo to have thelast word on the ability, but I'd give the Palantiri Doomed 1 or 2 (depending on how good they are) and reduce their resource cost so I can fetch them with the Seeing Stone to be super thematic.

From a thematic standpoint, a hero looks into the Palantir and that's why he is prepared (sort of) and is ready to do something else, while lending his willpower to the quest. And if forces of good fail. Palantir starts to consume the hero.

You see it as more thematic, I don't. The problem with your design is that characters that lose willpower after failing a quest changes nothing, his willpower (unreduced) was already contributed. Also, willpower subtraction and hero death based on it makes the card simply subpar for low willpower heroes and no threat for high willpower ones.

 

And, I don't see the point of attaching the Palantir to powerful questers. It's supposed to go on jacks-of-all-trades, like Prince Imrahil, who has decent enough willpower to quest and other stats to do something else. What's the point of having Eowyn ready outside of most of the quests?

## 239 [Gizlivadi on September 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1250935)

Good points Trololo. What do you think of my ideas? (the reformulated sentence, beng able to attach it to an istari, and the doomed keyword). Also, I was thinking the Palantir of Minas Tirith could do something related to the top card of the encounter deck or card draw, but in a more splashable way than the current Palantir.

I looked up the phrase in the rulebook,and you're right. Unless there is another card that references the amount of threat that exceeds the willpower with different wording, this one is correct. And the card looks perfect now.

I'm talking about a permanent willpower loss, like the Denethor ally. How is that not thematic? You said that when they fail, "Palantir starts to consume the hero." Look at Denethor. When he was "consumed", he no longer had the will to fight. His willpower then went so low that he even lost the will to live and tried to kill himself. I'm trying to represent that. I know this isn't the Palantir from Minas Tirith, but I don't know of any other stories that can tell anything about the negative effects of using the Palantir.

 

Also, most "jack-of-all-trades" Noble heroes can get 3+ willpower pretty easily with any of the attachments I already mentioned or from factional boosts, which would save them from dying from the first failed quest. Also, they now quest for less, so the Palantir's effect is weaker, which is a stronger downside than taking damage because damage can be healed and the loss of willpower cannot and the cards "good" effect is only useful if you have a lot of willpower.

 

I totally agree that Eowyn isn't a good target for this card. I never mentioned her name, did I? How about these guys who either have 3 willpower from the start or have thematic ways to raise it to 3+ (not using Favor of the Lady or Dunedain Quest):

 

Start with 3

Celeborn

Elrond

Glorfindel

Thorin

Theoden

 

Start with 2

Aragorn: Celebrian's Stone and/or Sword that was Broken

Faramir: Visionary Leadership

Gimli: Dain Ironfoot

Gloin: Dain Ironfoot

Prince Imrahil: Visionary Leadership

 

With the exceptions of Elladan, Elrohir, Eowyn, every Noble hero with 2 or more starting willpower can thematically get 3+ willpower and be useful in at least 1 aspect of combat. Even Elladan and Elrohir can be good targets with Favor of the Lady, Dunedain Quest, or if you're happy with the 2 willpower, by just not failing a quest.

 

I don't want to get into a heated debate with the most notorious troll on this forum. I'm just trying to defend my opinion that a permanent willpower loss is more thematic.

I'm not a troll, people just don't like when you do not agree with their opinion. And I do that a lot. Speaking of your arguments, the way you declare a permanent loss will not do - players are not going to keep that in mind, you'll need to place resource on your card. That's first. Second - you were discussing the Palantir of Orthanc, but you reference Denethor, which used the Palantir of Minas Tirith, which I work on right now.

Hmmm, interesting, but I'm not sure. So the first thing I thought is, "don't attach it to Denethor". If you ever plan on using him as a defender, which is to be expected given his 3 defense, he's in too great danger, not to mention that a single of those treacheries that damage exhausted characters is going to kill him right away. I like the idea of scrying the encounter deck for a proggressive cost based on the hero's willpower, that is cool, but it's a little too dangerous to attach to any hero with less than 3 willpower. Especially jacks of all trades who will defend or take damage eventually. An easy way to fix it without changing the ability much would be to just ditch the effect of discarding the hero if he gets 0 WP, and just stick with the cost of losing willpower and the threat gain. And finally, did you not like art I gave you? Was it too small? I like the one you used, but seeing that the guy behind is clearly a wizard, maybe it's more suitable for the Palantir of Orthanc.

Yes, your the art you provided looks extremely wierd on the cards to me for some reason (maybe just form is not fit).

 

The second palantir is about giving another use to willpower outside of questing. Denethor looked inside which, with time, drove him mad. You can scry before questing and if you see a damaging threachery - you prepare accordingly. Also, bring in some healing with you.

So just for fun I made Trololo's card using the art I had previously planned for this card. Does this look too weird? I'm actually planning on having these cards professionally printed, so any feedback is welcome. I must say I still don't quite like the part about discarding the hero if he gets to 0 willpower. It's a bit too harsh IMO to have the willpower become the new hitpoints, especially if the hero has less than 3 willpower. I think that cutting that line and just leaving the Palantir totally useless (since you cannot look at any cards if the WP is 0, and reducing the willpower for each point of damage) is enough drawback, besides of course the threat and damage whenever you reveal an enemy card.

Correct, but we have no reference to a Palantir wounding any characters. The only reference to a Palantir that caused any lasting harm was the Palantir in Minas Tirith, so I'm just going off that one.

Do you even know what "trolling" is? Trolling is an intentional attempt to make someone feel bad in some manner (angry/mad/sad) on purpose, BUT without them knowing you're doing it on purpose. Putting a "Trololo" in this situation does not help at all, and most real trolls you'll met will have unassuming nicknames, like "avergeJoe246".

## 253 [Gizlivadi on September 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1251952)

The proportions of my image are exactly the same as yours. The image I found on Google had two white bars on top of it and under it. I merely cut those and expanded the image a bit so it fit the box. Maybe the program (photoshop, I suppose) you used shrunk the image when you tried to put it in the card.

 

And I think a better way to put the last ability of the Palantir is: "Exhaust Palantir of Minas Tirith to look at the top X cards of the encounter deck, where X is attached hero's WP." OR, if you meant that the hero's WP is the maximum limit of cards you can look at, I'd say "to look at up to the top X..." And the rest is OK. I'm sure I've read that kind of wording before. If you agree, may I request a new version using that wording and minus the part that says to discard the hero if he has 0 Wp? Don't bother with the image, I will add it later with Paint.

I'm not much on the artwork, but here is a card I thought of last night:

A Third Beginning

Event

Cost 5

Secrecy 5

Discard 5 cards to draw 5 cards. Play this only during setup.

The idea is to give secrecy decks a chance at a third mulligan.

## 257 [MyNeighbourTrololo on September 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1252384)

Needs a shuffle in instead of discard mechanic and some out-of-setup effect to be viable.

## 258 [Epi Lepi on September 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1252419)

So I finally decided to download Photoshop and make some more "mystical" artifacts. I'd like to hear your opinion on each of these, since I haven't tested them or really sat down to consider how good or bad they are in relation to the resto of the card pool, so they are drafts, more or less, but as of now I'm happy with them.

Really like the idea behind Stolen and Forgotten Ring. +2 attack for stolen ring at 0 cost and just 1 more hit point on an enemy seems a bit too good though considering its not unique or restricted.

## 262 [Gizlivadi on September 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1253030)

Well, it's true that we have a pretty large amount of warrior and ranger heroes, I think they might be a bit too good. Should I make them restricted? They're already limit 1 per hero...

 

Also, I tried to make the theme of those cards as clear as possible. Glad you liked them.

## 263 [PsychoRocka on September 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1253038)

No you made them limit one per enemy and limit one per location not limit one per hero!

If you make them limit 1 per hero I think that's actually enough as taking up restricted slots makes no sense (especially considering they are only rings, not a hefty axe for example) and I would always rather simply play a 1 cost tactics attachment that gives +1/2 attack then a zero cost attachment that gives +1/2 that you have to earn by killing an enemy so they'd be more or less useless. One per character or making them unique would work much better than restricted I believe.

> Beautiful card

 

Thanks. Now, not to praise my custom card, but I want to say I really like how the art looks on the card. It's not the medium necessarily, but the style. I really like the rather simple decorations and ornaments. The base of the Palantir is just some leaves, and the little mantle is decorated with triangles and flowers. Not to mention the great use of color and lighting. But my point is that you can make beautiful "elven" looking decorations without using the now typical interlaced vines and flowing lines such as the ones in the structure in the background of the Galadriel hero, or the very borders of our own player cards, a style which arguably started with the LOTR movies. The only "canon" source of this style is the trees seen on the Doors of Durin, but if you look at past (before the movies) artist's interpretation of elven aesthetics as well as the Ralph Bakshi movie, elves are portrayed very differently. For some reason, artists now assume that this is how the "elven style" is made, quite unfortunately in my opinion, since in the books there are no detailed descriptions and it's mostly just the interpretation of John Howe mainly, which thanks to the popularity of the movies established itself as the canon of elven aesthetics, ignoring any other possible interpretations (of which there are many before the films, namely in MECCG). Sorry for the little rant, but I'm a little dissapointed that this game's designers and artists take the "easy route" and just think that "Elven" means interlaced and interwoven lines and vines. And don't get me worng, I think they're beautiful and fit the style of the elves, but people forget that this was mainly popularized by the movies, and there are many other ways you could portray elven decorations and such, not to mention it's getting a little tired IMO.

I'm wondering if 3 damage is too much. Forest Patrol is probably the closest comparison. It costs 1 and requires a Ranger to be in play and the target to be in a trap. This event costs 0, requires an ally to be destroyed by an enemy and costs an additional discarded ally. My event has more "painful" costs and requirements, but I believe they're easier to satisfy because they don't require a specific type of deck. Maybe if I just specify that you need to discard a Tactics ally it'll be good. Thoughts?

Also, remember that Nor am I a Stranger and Steward of Gondor can give the Rohan and Gondor traits to any heroes, so you can essentially use this with any hero. Of course Eomer and Prince Imrahil get the best use of it because Eomer will have 5+ attack and Imrahil will be readied for this attack. Whatcha think?

What do you think of these enviroment events? Do you think they're balanced? Do you think there's a better cost than exhausting a character of a specific trait? I kinda want these to be splashable, and considering how many allies we have with Scout and Ranger, it was a way of taking advantage of allies' traits.

I like the overall concept of these. Another thing you might consider is instead of exhausting an ally of specific trait you can put a requirement to play a card in form of controlling at least 1 hero with specific trait.

## 281 [Gizlivadi on September 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1262829)

That was my first idea, but then I thought that just having a ranger hero to reduce the threat of each card in the staging area for 0 cost was too powerful. Same with the other three. That's why i chose the exhausting cost, and it is made a little more flexible by the fact that you can also exhaust allies as well as heroes.

I think the exhausting of a character with a specific trait is quite nice for these. They may still need to add a cost of 1 to them to make them more balanced, but I don't know. I also feel like the Leadership event shouldn't focus on Willpower... but then again the Leadership sphere has Sword that was Broken, Faramir, and Visionary Leadership, so why not?

## 285 [monkeyrama on September 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1263285)

I think that the Lore card in particular needs a cost of 1 or 2 to help balance it. It's OK in single player, but is a bit much in multi-player for 0 cost. It could potentially reduce the threat in the staging area by 4-8, which is more than most similarly costed cards can!

Thanks for the feedback! I was thinking of adding a cost of 1 to each of them since Cover of Night can be bonkers in a three or four player game. I would like to find a way to balance them but since I only play solo I don't really care, lol. I already had my Palantiri and rings printed in a local printing enterprise and they look great! I'm going to print these as well and see how they work. They basically came from the idea that I'd like to see more events related to enviroment and "weather", like those we used to have back in Middle Earth the Wizards.

## 287 [MyNeighbourTrololo on September 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1263506)

Don't add the cost, the cost is already here - exhaustion of a character of particular trait. Just rebalance the card itself by making it scale with the number of player accordingly.

Do you have any ideas on how to do this? I honestly can't find a way since it's very hard to balance "each card in the staging area" according to the number of players.

## 289 [MyNeighbourTrololo on September 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1263549)

To lower the power curve you can substract 1 threat from staging area for each ranger you control. Or you can make a player choose the type of a card getting -1 threat (enemy or location).

## 290 [Gizlivadi on September 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1263583)

Choosing enemy or location to get lower threat is a great way to balance the card if there are 2 or more players. But I think this is the first card we see that has this type of effect, and it sounds hard just to word it.

## 291 [MyNeighbourTrololo on September 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1263598)

Action: Exhaust a Ranger character you control to name a card type. Until the end of the phase, each card in the sating area that matches named type gets -1 threat.

I love the alt art. There is a lot of great Eowyn vs Nazgul art out there and this may be some of the best.

 

I also really like the bard.

 

I'm not sure how I feel about Weary Horseman, though. Seems like the idea is to have a relatively cheap ally with above average stats. Nothing wrong with that, but cheap allies are generally what you want to see early game, and his ability really only make him viable later in the game when you have enough characters to guarantee you can quest well enough and still have some characters ready. It has great theme and a unique ability for sure, but I'm not sure if I'd play him.

## 296 [MyNeighbourTrololo on September 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1264640)

His low cost implies multisphere combination with good questing stuff. And you can always keep some 1/0/0/1 wimp ready for the case. That what I had in mind while designing him. There we plenty of versions of him - he was getting discarded at 31 or higher threat, he was exhausting from failed quest and else, else, else.

 

Here is another funny concept:

Also lampright has a very decent chance of not cancelling the card at all if you guess wrong.... Should be a somewhat expensive ally with decent stats but not quite as good as they should be for its cost and it should be able to discard to cancel a single surge. That would be awesome!

Amazing card! Congrats..., but i think it is overpowered. Maybe something like: exhaust Aragorn to cancel the effect of an encounter card just revealed with the sourge keyword from the encounter deck. Shuffle that card back into the encounter deck and reveal another encounter card.

I like the idea od this one.. but this ghost is overpowered. It is basically a indestructible attachment. Which is why the -Defence elves Mirkwood Runner attacks alone, to stop it being a sudo attachment. 

 

I would alter this one like this...

 

0 Health (Instead of 3)

Play only if you control a Noble Hero

Regretful Shade cannot defend or take damage

Start Regretful shade with 3 resource tokens

Action: Pay 1 resource token form Regretful shade to initiate an attack on an engaged enemy and reduce that enemies defence by 1 for the phase.

Remove from play if there are no resource tokens on regretful shade.

 

Now he is no longer a indestructable attachment, and also thematically fades away after a time. 

 

Other option might be cool is to change the action to this...

 

Action: During an attack on an enemy remove a resource token form Regretful shade to add 1 wound and lower the defence by 1 of attacked enemy for the phase. (limit once per enemy per attack)

I like this one... leadership so it is easy to get the steward card on it. I would remove the -1.. so it is a strait cost and make it a elf target Stand and Fight ... the tap effect is fine as Stand and Fight is a bonkers powerful ability as is and it is a event specific ability so most of the time you will be using his other stats. This will make a nice decision point about what part of him you wish to use on your turn.

I like this but as usaly with custom cards, to powerful. 0 cost is way two strong for a -1 threat and a untap each quest phase. I would say 2 cost at least. Probably 3 in fact.

This is one of the better customs I have seen, great art choice as well btw. Though I think the effect is still a little two strong. Surge greatly affects encounter deck power and being able to modify this drastically alters the game, which is probably why such a card does not exist already for keywords.

Slight wording change would clean up the language...

Response: After a card is revealed from the encounter deck with surge, pay one of Aragorn's resources and discard a card to cancel the surge effect. (limit once per round)

I would probably make this effect a tap effect like Elenore and remove the either the cost or the discard.

Because original had 3 hp and some card effects, both encounter and player, involve hp in their effect. Like Crumbling Ruin [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Crumbling-Ruin-KD].

 

Regarding him being overpowered: he is worse than a 2 attack ally, simply because 2 attack allies attack for 2 regardless, and Regretful Shade only attacks for 2 if victim has any defense to lose and/or is not immune.

Um. You need to pay 1 each time you trigger the effect, so a cost of 2 or 3 would simply kill it.

+1 Will and Untap so you get a quest bonus and then able to attack and defend is super powerful. +1 will.. changing say a 2 to a 3 or a 4 to a 5 (6 with discard).. that isn't small potatoes. Anyway each to their own.. as long as you have fun.

Ok, Unexpected Courage, cost 2, ready whenever the hell you want, for free, for any purpose.

 

The horse, cost 0, ready only after you commit to a quest and get +1 wp, by paying 1 resource.

 

Horse is only useful for those who can effectively go on a quest, and it gives them an action at the expense of an entire turn worth of their resources. If you want to use it consistently, you'll be paying much more than for Unexpected Courage.

Because it is not enough imo. Not only have you power creeped the original mark, as in this card is now a 100% direct replacement. You have also ignored the precedence already shown in the set of it being at least a 1 cost. So it should at the very least have that cost.. but as the effect is so bonkers powerful.. I still think 3. But hey.. w/e you prefer is fine. I like less powerful customs myself.

Maybe you didn't understood it before, but my version is a rework. Its implyed that it replaces the original, because orignal is, to be honest, is useless. Even with recently spoiled Charge of Rohirrim. Default Steed costs 1, requires 1 to ready. So if you trigger it the same turn you play it, you spend 2 on it. It is equal to UC, while UC will ready you infinitely until the end of days just for 2, and steed will eat 1 resource per turn. Steed requires Rohan or Gondor. There is no point stacking Steeds on one character. You can't spend resources from other heroes to trigger the Steed.

 

No one in their right mind would pay 3 for a card like this. All I wanted to do is fit Steed of the Mark into the current meta and make it an appealing choice even with existance of UC.

First of all, Unexpected Courage is only slightly overpowered. And regardless, every other readying ability has to be compared to Unexpected Courage despite being overpowered because they probably won't errata it. So every other readying effect in the game needs offer something that Unexpected Courage does not offer in order for people to actually play it. The real Steed of the Mark is a dud thanks to it sharing the same sphere and ultimately costing far more than Unexpected Courage. If it was Leadership it might be worthwhile. But if we keep it in Spirit, then I think MNT's buffs are appropriate and far from being overpowered. You could pay 4 resources for Unexpected Courage and Favor of the Lady to achieve the exact same thing and it will last more than 4 turns. The only advantages are that Steed of the Mark is only one card and that you don't have to slowly build up the resources to play it.

Steed of the Mark is not restricted because it is used for questing and consumes resources on regular basis.

 

Steed of Minas Ithil costs 2 because:

1) He is from Leadershit - an extremely resource rich sphere;

2) Warhorse readies a hero after defeating an enemy, meaning all things that hero could do is attack another enemy (most of the time), while Steed of Minas Ithil provides finesse - you could defend then attack, you could defend an out of combat attack and then be ready for combat one.

3) The defending action is overall more valuable than attacking one because you need enough defenders to be able to muster enough standing attack to retaliate with effectiveness.

Yeah, assuming you play to win. This game is so easy if you just build power decks. You have to self censor to make the game fun. Yes UC is the most powerful untap in the game. Though in our games we give it the unique and restricted traits. This fixes the card and allows for all the other untap cards to be functional again.

untap... It's not Magic: The Gathering.. And it's not a PvP game either, so you can house rule to make it harder for yourself, if that's what you want. So, there are different opinions on UC and if you would fix it, and then on how you would fix it. I don't think UC is broken, I think it is just powerful. And I don't have any problem with UC at all, because if you would build a deck with only 1 UC (1 Core Set) the changes of it showing up in a 50 card deck is 1/50, thus very small.

Agree big time. I play with 2 copies (one is a proxy) and don't get it every game. Sometimes I get one copy rarely two and even when I do I usually have other more useful cards I use first or instead.

Thematically, Unexpected Courage should not be unique or restricted, which is why it isn't. If you want to deal with Unexpected Courage thematically, it wouldn't be repeatable. How many times can one character find their courage and it still be unexpected? Of course, this would just make it into Cram. Anyway, we're not talking about how we would change UC.

The thing is: not everyone wants to set limits on the cards like you do booored. I prefer to keep things simple and play the game as specified in the rules and FAQ and with the card pool I've been given. In that case, Steed of the Mark is remarkably underpowered compared to all of the other readying attachments. Sadly, because I like to keep things simple in the way I just mentioned, I will not be playing MNT's version of the mounts, but I think that his versions would make good substitutes to balance things out and make them all more useful, though I'm not so sure Rohan Warhorse really needs the +1 attack while it is ready, though it is nice to have so that you don't feel the need to decide if you want the horse or a weapon.

No, Rohan Warhorse does not really needs the +1 attack. But itll be cool for him to have it for multiple reasons:

1) He's restricted, so let him work for this restricted a little harder;

2) He is useless if you're facing a single foe. 1 attack is not much, but it's something;

3) Thematic reasons. A charge on a horse for a plus 1 damage :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Yea, I know. Rohan Warhorse has a lot of good reasons to have +1 attack (least of all the fact that Firefoot has bonus attack, probably for the same reason that Rohan Warhorse should: reason #3 that you gave). But yea, Rohan Warhorse is already powerful in its own right, so I wouldn't be upset if it didn't get any buffs, though the "Limit 1 mount per character" nerf does weaken it enough that I wouldn't be opposed to buffing it with the +1 attack.

The name Bloodworm is taken from a kenning for "sword". It's supposed to represent one of the swords in the Trolls' hoard, as the quote says.

 

 

I know that the developers have been emphatic on that there should be no bleeding between the spheres and that no single archetype should be self sufficient solo (to which I disagree btw). These swords are supposed to be exceptional and incredibly powerful, designed especially to solve one of the sphere's weaknesses. Let me know what you think!

I think the Lore one is too much like Protector of Lorien. I also think that the Tactics one MIGHT be better if based off of the excess damage dealt by everyone who participated... which could potentially be far more powerful, but would totally make mono Tactics far more viable outside of battle and siege.

## 347 [Gizlivadi on January 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1420517)

Protector of Lórien was the absolute inspiration for that card I admit, but imagine, if PoL is already pretty powerful, if it could boost attack as well could be insane. 

 

I think Fengwine is possibly too powerful, I mean, consider enemies nowadays, they're pretty tough. 4 hitpoints is kinda like the standard hitpoint value now.Attack with Eomer +  and place 4  But even if it was 2 hitpoints, giving a hero Legolas' ability for a turn is pretty good on its own. I think it's fine. Also, it combos with my also custom Looted Ring which gives +1 hitpoint to the enemy.

I designed a big box expansion with player cards and three quests, and am working on the expansion packs now; I'm rather bad at finding art, though - can anyone help me with that? For an initial spoiler, one of the heroes is a tactics Eowyn that doesn't unbalance the tactics sphere but still keeps the same base stats, and also makes a better job of symbolizing her slaying of the Nazgul.

 

Eowyn - 9 threat

4 will

1 attack

1 defense

3 hit points

Eowyn has -1 will and +1 atk equal to the greatest threat value on an enemy in play. Eowyn's willpower cannot be reduced past 0 with this ability.

 

Basically, it means that with the normal 2 threat she's 2/3/1/3, which isn't that powerful, but if only treacheries or locations are revealed, she has her full 4 willpower in tactics, and her attack facing the Witch-king is a full 5.

## 350 [XerxesPraelor on January 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1423058)

On non-big box note, I think Merry's design is rather lacking - readying really doesn't make sense (Eowyn was definitely not "ready" after killing the Witch-king". I think his second ability should be to instead of attacking, double the attack of another attacking hero with a cost of taking a damage. That would (as a side note) make him combo with my Eowyn, but also with Gimli and any other buffed-up attacker. (except beorn)

First off, we do not need any more spirit heroes with 3 attack. Nor do we need to put the best defender in the game as spirit, which is exactly what he would be with this ability (especially with Burning Brand attached). Plus you are combining his role as the best defender plus a good attacker by readying him. I'm not buying it. Very interesting idea but needs some balancing.

## 353 [alogos on February 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1447595)

Maybe something like this:

"Response: When the first enemy is revealed from the encounter deck, cancel it's when revealed effect and engage him. Deal him one shadow card. This enemy cannot be defended except by Boromir

Response: When an enemy engage you, raise your threat by 1. Boromir does not exhaust do defend against this enemy this turn".

Really verbose, but seems feeting for a spirit version of him.

 

Also, Spirit is a good sphere for defense and has some of the best buff in it (Against the Shadow, Hasty Stroke, Light the Beacon). Lore is more for healing, Tactics for counterattack and Leadership for pure defense buff. I don't see problem with another 3 attack-good defender in Spirit. It just means it's a warior with strong will.

Yea. Considering the only way he would ever take any damage from an attack is via shadow, getting Song of Wisdom and Burning Brand on him is all you need to make him a great defender. You can use up all of the restricted slots for boosting his attack.

You can't trigger the action if you have played a card on the same round. Like Opressive Forest... if it is revealed in quest phase and you have played a card, you cant play anymore cards till next round.

You can. Look: 

I play card 1 for 2 resources, then I play card 2 for 1 resources, then I trigger the action of your hero, reduce the cost of the card and play card 3 for 0 resources without the need to play anything else this round.

It could certainly be worded a bit better. The last sentence doesn't even have a subject, and it actually allows you to play more cards, since it says "then, cannot play more than 1 card this round", after you have used the ability, so it lets you play 1 more card. I would write it like this : "Action: Lower the cost of the next card you play by 2. Then, you cannot play cards until the end of the round."

But then, you can play cards before it. The idea is to play only 1 card 1 round when you trigger Thranduil. No more than 1 card.

## 371 [Gizlivadi on March 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1481776)

Then you add as a final clause the following: "You cannot play more cards this round", or something like that. And make the ability itself target the first card you play this round, since you'll only play one card anyway, and that has to be the first card. If you didn't play anything in the planning phase and then a treachery appears and you Test of Will it, that will be the first card you play that round, and the only one.

You can't prevent players from playing some cards before triggering the action unless you add a specific requirement or ouside-of-action text to the card.

## 374 [monkeyrama on March 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1482114)

If the intent is to limit the number of cards played to 1, then the text should target the first card you play that round, and then specify that you cannot play any further cards. As a first shot, no doubt riddled with problems:

 

Lower the cost of the first card you play this round by 2. You may only play one card this round.

 

Does this have the required effect?

They are Noldor though, but you probably know that and I'm misreading. I suppose we haven't got very strong attackers or defenders in Silvan because they're supposed to rely on entering/leaving play effects and, rather crucially, Celeborn's boost - whereas Noldor overall seem to have higher stats and are meant to stand their ground throughout the game. (Defender of the Naith reaches 3 def with the boost and has a readying effect, though.) At least, that's how I play them. The Lorien Cloak from Celebrimbor's Secret was perfect for elvish support decks for this reason, and I hope for more Noldor support in Angmar Awakened. Already quite excited about the new victory display strategy.

Yes, I meant for the Silvan-Noldor archetype to play with. There are some setups with the Silvan trait that use Elrond as a defender or Elrohir as PsychoRocka does in his dual Silvan awesome deck. 
Defender of the Naith is actually the only ally/character that has the Silvan trait who's sole purpose is defending/is capable of defening (and not even that capable..), that's why I thought this Thranduil card would allow that, but then again, Silvans are indeed more focused on being cheap but the cost is that they're fragile.

I don't know, I think the cost is totally fair. Put her at 2 cost, and I would argue it could be potentially overpowered. The ability won't always be useful or have a good target, but there are tons of enemies that this would be useful with and you could cut out their legs from under them. Just to cite a few examples, the Crazed Captive from Nightmare Dol Guldur could be killed without the threat increase of 7, you could use allies to defend against the Orc-chieftain in Journey in the Dark, you could bypass the Morgul Bodyguard in Morgul Vale, you could even get around the damage limit of the Mumak. In fact, I think the ability is so powerful and potentially able to find exploits in scenarios that I don't know if we'll ever see it. If we do, it will probably be even more expensive or tricky to pull of than this. Given that she is Silvan, you can easily bounce her in and out of play to keep triggering it.

I can see that if she was cost 2, she would be a little too good (Rumil is four cost, and has only 1 higher willpower and 1 higher defence). The gap between 3 cost and 4 cost is quite big, and Silvan gives lots of opportunities for bouncing. And the ability is pretty good. Give her ranged as well, and she fits quite nicely into the unique slots for Silvan.

It's not a benefit - it's a thematic downside. He costs only 1 - which is very good for his stats, but he traps a random card from your hand until he leaves play, "guarding" it. It's bad for you.

I dont see how it's bad, honestly. Essentially, he costs 1 for a chump block and a drawn card... where is the downside?

## 402 [monkeyrama on March 24, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1503906)

It's a card from your hand, not your deck. So he removes options before then returning them, rather than adding something that is gained later by losing him via a chump block. If I understand the card correctly.

> It's a card from your hand, not your deck. So he removes options before then returning them, rather than adding something that is gained later by losing him via a chump block. If I understand the card correctly.

Correct, he temporarily strips you from one of the cards in your hand (unless he was the last card in your hand when you played him), and he strips you of random one, possibly removing something you might need later on. He also has 2def and 2hp, which is not that chumpy.

Play him last during the prep phase, then use him to block. You're only losing the card for a few phases in many cases... unless of course no enemies have more than 3 attack... in which case, don't play him.

Yes ^^. But you need anyway DarkKnowledge or SilverPlate. And the combo is complete.

 

However it has a more simply use and also very good: you can change the shadow cards when 1 is revealed by 1 still not. It means like you 'cancel' a shadow, the shadow of the first enemy finally is not revealed (cause of the order of time).

Since I mainly play 3/4p games, ranged has become very crucial for combat purposes. So in the end Bard, Legolas and Haldir gets played in most of the games. Because the race of Men only could become ranged by Dunedain Cache I thought something ranged would really help them out to get some more play time in the games I play. This is the idea I came up with.

That should probably be restricted. All in all, I like the concept of a disposable weapon. Personally, to simplify the mechanics, I would make it a single use and give a bonus to attack while making that ranged attack.

## 412 [Jban on April 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1525197)

The complete idea is to allow ranged within Rohan/Gondor without giving them the ranged keyword. So you cannot attach Black arrow or play Hands upon the bow.

 

Because it only has 3 uses before it goes out, restricting it doesn't look useful to me. The uniqueness  (and limit 1 per character - unnecessary) already hold the players down from swarming the table with spears.

It's more of a matter of standards: most weapons should be restricted. I didn't notice the unique symbol, which just doesn't make sense to me. Why would a generic item called "Thrown Spear" be unique?

Mndela, using the time mechanic doesn't make much thematic sense to represent an "ammo" mechanic.

## 415 [Jban on April 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1527177)

I guess the unique has to go, and the Limit 1 per char stay. 

 

But since this weapon doesnt grant any additional strength, I considered it to be of the same strength as the Rivendell Bow. Which also is not restricted. So therefore the choice to make it only 1 per char. and it being a weapon allows many effects (Foe-Hammer, Bofur, Goblin-Cleaver) so 1 cost doesn't seem that bad to me. 

## 416 [joezim007 on April 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1527227)

I don't really understand the limit 1 per character. What does someone gain by having two on one character at a time? There is no point in limiting it with the teensy tiny bit you gain from it.

I don't see this is a jerkism ^^. Just a way of trying to improve the idea.

 

The reason why I thought it had to be a "limit 1 per character" is because of all the readying able when attacking. Suppose the hero attached has some Warhorses, or would be Boromir, the complete table would be cleaned straightaway. This seemed too strong in my opinion.The idea is that you can help your buddies when they are in a moment of need, it's not the idea to get all heroes ranged straightaway. Secondary by only allowing 1, Attachment Removal will be more annoying.

That seems like an edge case that I wouldn't worry too much about. Other than Boromir, no hero can ready enough to make use of it and Hammer-stroke can be pretty much the same thing for Boromir to enable him to kill every enemy.

Interesting. Not sure if that should be Spirit sphere, but she doesn't seem to fit any 1 sphere. The damage=threat+card ability should technically be a Forced effect, but w/e. Do you have any particulars for choosing these abilities? I can kinda see the theme with sharing defense but what about the other abilities.

Nice, I like it.

 

She seems a "I would rather stay at home" kinda girl, while the boys (her bros, dad and that upstart boyfriendo) run around doing heroics stunts. So in terms of the lore she fits in nicely. During the long hours when there is nothing on but reruns on the Rivendell TV, she could maybe pair up with the other Middleearth housewife Galadriel. You now, doing some "justgirlythings", looking into the bowl of Galadriel, chatting up how dreamy Celebribmor's card art is or perhaps if Arargorn's scruffy gob is better. Then they could sent for to get Mirlonde, who is of couse not as popular as them or from the same league even, BUT who earlier this day said that she has some sick discounts to share. Evening shopping was the plan. But now when Mirly shows she revealed that the discounts are only for those who wear green. Which sucks, right? Green... is sooooo Second Age. No way. This deck won't work.

I like the theme of "stay home and help from afar" like Galadriel does, but I think she should be more of a healer or willpower granter. I never entirely understood the ally's defense boost thematically, and this is just a bit ridiculous. 3 defense is a huge boost though I guess it essentially comes at the expense of a hero slot.

Im kinda just thinking out loud and I dont really know how Id handle her personally. Take my words with a grain of salt.

The only thing I may be able to contribute that everyone might agree on is that I could Photoshop the card art to give her pointed ears, though conaidering itll never be released, I dont see the point in the work.

Lol Gamling.. cost 5, gives you 0. Why would I ever wanna play him? Not to be rude, but I can get three Songs for cheaper and not risking it to go away if Gamling dies.

 

I like Quickbeam, but I think for thematic reasons, he should be the only Ent who doesn't enter play exhausted, thus you should change his stats I guess.

 

Like Narya, but I would cost it 3, maybe even 4. This would be a new recursion effect and those are strong. It's essentially a new WotW, less powerfull, but repeatable to the max.

Narya should probably just remove the Leadership icon and I think it would be good enough at 2. It doesn't deserve 3 or 4 because it exhausts Gandalf as well, though I wouldn't be too upset at a cost of 3. It is arguably less powerful than Vilya which also costs 2 since it doesn't bring anything into play for free, but it could also be argued that it is more powerful than Vilya, since it gives you access to cards that are no longer generally accessible. They do such different things, though, that it's very difficult to judge. 

 

> Quickbeam is mega OP.

 

I agree. I say that you either need to set the HP to 3 and Def to 2, or get rid of the bonus defense ability, otherwise with some decent healing, you could draw 3 cards per round and have a 6 defense defender, which is pretty ridiculous. At 3 HP and 2 defense base, you can normally draw 2 (3 if you heal and then damage some more) and have a 4 defense defender, which is still pretty darn strong, but still breakable.

 

Honestly, though, I think the ability would be best as a response to taking damage rather than as an action to place the damage yourself, especially because just doing the action automatically builds up the Booming Ent as well.

 

As for Gamling... I really don't know what to say. Sounds more like an attachment than an ally.

So...ngs -> Songs. Songs only cost 1 to give anyone a permanent icon so claiming that it should cost a lot is silly. My point was that the icon does add value to the card and if you get rid of that icon-granting, you help keep Narya more affordable. I certainly wasn't claiming that granting Gandalf an icon is too powerful, but I don't think it belongs on the ring, though the other rings grant an icon, so it makes sense to keep it.

> I edited my cards.Are better?

 

A bit.

 

Gamling's effect still seems better on an attachment, but if you really want it on an ally, you should give him something to do besides die. Just give him a few stat points. Also, his ability should probably specify that it works on Theoden hero, just in case they come up with a Theoden ally. I'm not sure what effects it would really have on an ally.

 

For Quickbeam I would have rather had reduced numbers than a raised cost. I like that you made the "damage = defense" part of the action and limiting it to the end of the round instead of making it static, so that you can't just damage him and leave the damage there to be an uber defender forever, but the combo with a decent healer still stands as I mentioned it, though now it is actually stronger. You can damage him for 3, then heal him for 3 immediately, and he'll be a 6 defense, 5HP ally, plus you'll get 3 cards. I think this would be better:

 

Quickbeam

Cost 3,Lore,Unique

Ent.

Willpower: 1

Attack:2

Defense:2

Hit Points:4

Cannot have restricted attachments. Enters play exhausted.

Action:Deal 1 damage to Quickbeam to draw 1 card and give Quickbeam +1 Defense until the end of the phase (Limit 2 times per round).

 

Cost of 3 makes him way more affordable and still a good discount, 2 Defense and 4 HP limits the power I was talking about before. Also limiting the action to 2 times per round and limiting the defense boost until the end of the phase instead of the end of the round makes it far more balanced. Now he maxes out at 4 Def, which is probably the highest an ally should be able to get without help. Even a 5 or 6 cost ally shouldn't have the power you gave him.

 

As for Narya, I'm still on the fence between 2 and 3 cost. 3 means people shouldn't consider it overpowered, but when compared to Vilya, I'm still not sure it's more powerful. I would accept 3 cost though.

Well, let's say the top card of your deck is Grim Resolve. You're playing a deck with Elrond, Gandalf and X. Gandalf has 5 resources, Elrond has Vilya attached and Gandalf Narya. You then play Grim Resolve with Gandalf after questing. Then use Narya and after defending use Vilya again for a massive swing.

In this example, I would say thay Narya should cost more then Vilya, because of it's ability uniqueness. WotW tgus it more powerfull but shuffles instead of picks the top card (which you can play to be card X, like the new Hama maybe), and the Spirit event adds it to your hand and is limited to spirit. Narya is just great with Gandalf and alliws so more tricks.

What would be your view on that, joezim007? Maybe you'll have some better examples, mine is also very situational..

I still don't know. I still think putting cards into play for free is more powerful than single-card recursion. I think that if you really need to make this card weaker, then specify that it must be the top card of the discard pile rather than allowing you to choose any card in the discard pile. I could potentially see changing the card to make it get shuffled into the deck, but then it doesn't mesh as nicely. I prefer swapping the top cards.

I really like the Dunedain Vigilant, however there are many quest cards and unique encounter cards with forced effects that should not be bypassed or the quest can break. For this reason I would suggest the following revision:

Response: Discard Dunedain Vigilant to cancel the forced effect of a non-unique encounter card.

I think that since those locations are so few, it wouldn't be too bad. Also, Secret Vigil can easily lower the collective threat of a 3- or 4-player party by as much or more than most of those, I'm not too worried about it. I might agree that it should be 2 cost though.

After Theoden provides the rohan players of 'resources', now rohan needs more drawing effects. Here is our new hero:

I think I'd prefer 2/2/1/3. I'm not particularly fond of heroes having a zero in any stat point unless they are really specialized (e.g. Beregond, Beorn, Galadriel).

I know that anachronisms probably will not happen, but I would be over the moon if we saw something like this in the coming cycle. Would love to see more official combat-savvy Noldor cards, even though their fighting days are mostly over.

Lol, talking about OP.

Gil-Galad has à usefull ability, but some games it'll never trigger, like in quests as Hills of Emyn which only have 1 quest card and no side-quests. Of course you could install your own side-quests in it, but for solo that ain't so viable. Of course his stats are awesome, but nontheless..

Yeah, this was made with the new side quest mechanics and Noldor discard strategy in mind. Something to shine with in multiplayer. It's not a feasible hero suggestion, just a fun way of making him over-powered - which I think he should be.

That alternative Theoden is amazing.

There was a card suggested called Dunedain Vigilance that would blank text on enemies. As a flavor suggestion I think any card that would have that effect should be called Wine of Dorwinion. In the Hobbit the elves who were supposed to be keeping watch got drunk on the wine which allowed Bilbo to get the keys and facilitate the escape in the barrels. We need a Wine of Dorwinion card!

That seems pretty powerful. I think the Action is really restrictive because it can only work for one card.

Personally, I think the response should be limited to once per round/phase.

For the action, I would probably not have it on the same hero as the Response, and I would prefer that it was more generic, like search the top 5 cards of your deck for a Lore attachment.

Denethor

Hero,Leadership

Gondor.   Noble.   Steward.

1 Willpower

3 Hit Points

Action:Spend one resource from Denethor's resource pool to chose a card in your hand and  put it face down under your control(Limit once per round).

Each face down card under your control  is called "Denethor's Guard" and acts as an ally with 1 Willpower ,1 attack and 1 hit point.

I like this idea. The guard absolutely need the Gondor trait though, so that they gain synergy with Boromir, Visionary Leadership and For Gondor!

Maybe adjust it a bit: either make the guard cost 2 or make it just have 1 defense and 1 hit point. That way you either NEED the synergy cards to make them anything better than chumps or you aren't getting 2+ willpower/attack for only 1 resource. Also, I was thinking about limiting the ability to a planning action so you don't have the option to spawn a chump blocker at any moment; it would require a bit of forethought. Either way, I LOVE this as a way to get rid of dead cards in your hand and it would open up deck builds that are FILLED with unique attachments and little to no allies.

Him plus the new Legolas would make card draw a little too good for Tactics. If you were going to do anything like this, I would limit it to only drawing a card if Beregond defends an attack without taking damage... or if you want to make it a bit more frequent, make it limited to only drawing a card if Beregond defends an attack without being destroyed.

 

I kinda like where you were headed with the Beorn idea too... Make him another ally and you draw a card each time Beorn is damaged by an attack. As an ally it would be slightly more difficult to heal him, and if he has a more limited health pool, he'll NEED to be healed to make the best use of his ability. Fun ideas, but like I said, it still might be a little too much card draw for Tactics, though the allies would all pretty expensive.

Gandalf's Protection

Spirit,Event,Cost 6

Secrecy 2.

Play only if you control the hero version of Gandalf.Lower your threat by 10.

Attach to Gandalf.

The designs are not bad but Gandalf really doesn't need any more attachments that only work on him. 

He's already extremely powerful and can discard shadow cards, provide card draw or resource acceleration, helps you speed through your deck, can pay for cards of any sphere (so long as its on top of your deck), can swap a card in your hand with the top card of your deck and now even has Shadowfax so can have sentinel and ranged as well and an additional ready and use!! We will no doubt get Narya at some point as well... which will potentially only be usuable on Gandalf and have a powerful effect so I really don't think we need to see anything else for Gandalf to be honest. 

The threat reduction card seems a little overpowered even for its high cost and secrecy seems like a weird additional to it as you will normally want to use it to get INTO secrecy not while in secrecy.

I'm going to make 4 hero cards for each of the remaining wizards (found some cool art), plus some events or attachments that work with them. The problem is, I don't have a clue of what abilities I could give them. I want them all to be neutral and 14 starting threat, so they'll have to somehow gain a resource icon. Any ideas for these? So far I thought Saruman could be like:

 

2 wp, 4 attack, 3 defense, 5 hp. Play with the top card of the encounter deck faceup. Saruman is considered to have the printed resource icon of the hero with the highest threat among heroes you control. Does it look too OP? 

## 486 [Ecthelion III on May 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1640242)

Saruman is complete OP in solo, in practice. I think it should be: "Planning Action: Spend a resource from Saruman's resource pool. Until the end of the round, play with the top card of the encounter deck faceup."

Before, the ability was pretty much Henamarth plus Silver Lamp (since you see each shadow before it is dealt) for free.

## 487 [Gizlivadi on May 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1640251)

Good catch about the shadow cards. I think I prefer this other ability for him: You may use Saruman's reoucres to pay for cards of any sphere. When playing a card this way, Saruman is considered to have the printed tactics, leadership, spirit and lore resource icons, and that card gains doomed 1. Does it look too much like Grima?

Personally, I don't think there's any need to make all the wizards have 14 threat - it always seemed pretty clear to me that Gandalf and Saruman were more powerful than Radagast, and we don't really know about the blue wizards but there's no reason to think they'd be on exactly the same level.

That's totally fair, but I want them to have the same threat just for consistency's sake, and because it gives a power guideline for their stats, abilties, etc. Also, the idea is that the wizards, much like hero Gandalf, are these big epic heroes that provide some kind of "glue" for multisphere decks.

I like the theme in "You're doomed if you count on Saruman as your hero!" It also would be interesting in that it encourages you to use him to pay for high cost cards and not lower cost ones. Would the FAQ require you to raise your threat to resource match with Saruman for 0 cost cards? The high starting threat also seems appropriate. Lower willpower than attack and defense makes sense to me with the way the story goes.

 

I don't have enough cards/experience to say about how it'd affect the card pool/balance.

I don't think Forbidden Knowledge would technically work as you've written it there - I believe the Doomed should trigger as soon as you play the card, before triggering the effect, but you don't know the Doomed value until you trigger the effect. I think instead the end of the action should say "Then, this card gains Doomed X."

 

@Mikallo: According to the FAQ, Saruman wouldn't be able to play 0-cost sphered cards at all because you're not spending his resources. I personally think this is a stupid ruling (a subject on which I plan to elaborate in a Warden of Arnor post at some point), but that is what the rulings say.

Darn, I think you're right about Forbidden Knowledge... but the card does just exactly what I want it to do! Is there a way around this, or maybe I should just leave it as it is? I mean, the order of costsreally messes it up, but it's perfectly understandable what the card does.

## 495 [danpoage on May 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1641336)

It would work if you worded it something like this:

Action: Look at the top card of the encounter deck. You may choose to give Forbidden Knowledge Doomed X, where X is the threat of the card that you looked at. If you do, draw X cards.

## 496 [John Constantine on May 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1641391)

You may replace action with a response.

 

Something like:

Cost: 0

Doomed X.

Response: After an encounter card is revealed from the encounter deck, draw X cards, where X is the threat of the revealed card.

I like it, but wouldn't it be pretty much the same as the first version? You still have to pay fully for the card before the encouter card is revealed. In any case, I like Dan's version the best, mainly because you still peek at the encounter deck which is part of the flavor.

D'oh, I forgot Seeing Stone wouldn't work. I guess it could work as a response, the good thing about it is that you can wait for a particularly high threat card to appear, which is nice. I guess that with all the palantiri I made as well you have pretty good encounter card scrying. Will post the fixed version later.

Radagast is lore, so you must have a lot of healing options. You first try one undefended attack, if Radagast is alive still (he has 5hp, so could be not hard), you can heal without sacrificing any ally. If shadow effect increase attack and Radagast would die, then you can use a Criature to avoid it.

In adittion, we all know how chump blockers are risk. Sometimes, undefended attack is more better.

I understand how the game works and is true that you can discard an exhausted creature, but in terms of deck building, I wouldn't want to rely on a creature heavy deck in the chances I might be able to pull that off just when I needed it, when, at most, I am STILL down a card. Why not just put chump blockers in if I'm going to be down a card anyway. That's my point. Rohan decks often suffer from the exact same problem.

As for the second Radagast. I like the ability a lot, but I just think it works better on Saruman.

## 510 [PocketWraith on May 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1643034)

Cards played from discard being removed from the game when they leave play is too much book-keeping. Events are easy enough, but when you chump block with an ally or have to discard an attachment to a shadow effect, are you really going to consistently remember that four rounds ago you played it from your discard pile rather than your hand?

## 511 [Gizlivadi on May 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1643077)

Fair enough, what other restriction would you come up with? 

 

Maybe leave the first part as it is, and then, "After playing a card this way, discard a card from your hand." That could be good or bad depending on the situation, and opens room for shenanigans

## 512 [DukeWellington on May 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1643188)

Don't worry about removing it from the game, just give the card an addition doom cost. Again, it works better on Saruman. Something like this:

Action: Choose a card in your discard and give it Doom 2 to play it as if it were in your hand. While using this action, Saruman gains the resource icon of the card selected this way.

## 513 [Gizlivadi on May 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1643254)

Well, the idea was precisely not to make it a doomed cost. I know Saruman would be good with such an ability, but I decided to give the discard pile ability to Radagast. 

 

I think this could be fairly balanced while easier to keep track of:

I like the idea of making the two blue wizard's companions, like Elladan and Elrohir. Like while one is in play the other gains extra card draw or resources. I also like at least one of them having an ability that cancels treacheries, like Eleanor.

## 515 [Gizlivadi on May 31, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1643365)

Well, the main limitation for this cycle of wizard heroes is that they're neutral. Yes, I know people like Mndela above would make such a hero with a printed sphere icon, but to me the wizards just have to feel unique and different from the rest of the heroes, and we have hero Gandalf as example to continue the trend and make the whole team. But, it is unlikely that we'll ever have Alatar and Pallando (Saruman or Radagast heroes are more likely), so I decided to make my own wizards and to make them as playable and balanced as possible. Anyway, what I had so far was:

 

Alatar, 11, 2, 2, 2, 5   . While Pallando is in play, Alatar gains either the Lore or Spirit resource icon. Alatar's resource icon cannot change.

 

 

And Pallando is the same but with Leadership and Tactics. The final sentence is that basically you choose only one of them and cannot change it with its own ability, though you can add an icon with a song.  Maybe I could have that, plus your suggestion of gaining a resource for Pallando, for example, or drawing a card with Alatar. I'm not convinced by cancelling treacheries. Too many actions and responses would just saturate the card. Wizards need pretty much only one or two big abilities, that are simple yet powerful. I like the passive ability of drawing cards and resources, will use that.

So here's my first rendition. The basic idea is that if both are in play, you can have any combination of 2 spheres, which gives great flexibility for both solo and multiplayer. I decided to have the second ability independent of the other wizard, since even in solo just having a neutral hero with decent stats and that gains an additional resource or draws a card each round can be great. So that gives even more options to run just 1 of these in a deck, just give him a song or two and the Istari toys I'm making and he can become very good.

I wasn't replying to you saying they're blue, just pointing out that if I want to make these all neutral the main thing to solve is how they can pay for cards, just like how Gandalf works.

No, you got it wrong, it's only 2 resource icons. You choose one for each hero at the beggining of the game (if both are in play) and it cannot change, though you can give them songs.

Pallando is very similar to New Theoden, but I think maybe a lot better. You have a extra resource that you can use to play anything in his sphere, only condition is Alatar. The spread of stats is not that good, since specialized hero > all around.il

 

No need to talk about Bilbo and Alatar. But Bilbo is not fair game, since he sucks =/

 

Theoden only work with specific trait, Rohan, with specific type of card, Allies. His saving grace is that he has arguably better spread of stats, sentinel and +1 threat.

 

If you compare with Elladan and Elrohir, the brothers cost -2 threat, arguably better stats (-1hp, +1atk/def), an ability that has a very costly condition (pay resources to ready) and have less versatility in deck building.

 

I think the Wizards are a lot stronger and a lot more versatile, also they can build better decks, since you can choose sphere, get more resources and cards. They need some small nerf in my opinion, some kind of condition in the card draw/resource generation.

 

Anyhow, I really like then! The idea is good and almost playable, just need a little bit of less generic awesomeness.

I think the first condition on each should say "setup: if so and so is in play..." to make it more clear.

I also think you can just add one point on to each of their starting threat levels and they would be balanced. The new Theoden, for instance, has 11 worth of stats but a 12 cost. So you could make them both 12

## 523 [Gizlivadi on June 1, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1643712)

I thought about the relation to Theoden and dismissed it, thinking they had enough of a drawback. And yes indeed they are a bit too powerful, I like the idea of raising their threat by 1, seems fair. About Setup effects, I generally try to avoid them, even on heroes. I don't like them really. There has to be some way of redacting it without a setup effect.

 

The 2 2 2 stat lineup was indeed thought as a drawback, they're just all around heroes, essentially small Gandalfs, but with 1 less stat, except hit points.

And if you play only two cards per turn (because you draw 2 per turn) you can keep that free test of will the entire game.

 

Disciple of Pallando is hard to activate. Need 3 turns of not spending anything with Pallando.

 

With that logic, considering that we begin play with 6 cards and play 1 each turn, Disciple of Alatar should be activated with at least 9 cards in hand. The thing is that drawing cards is easier than adding resources, so I think at least 10 cards in hand.

 

Anyway, Disciple of Alatar has a much better ability then Disciple of Pallando. So maybe 12 cards is more correct to be balanced.

The other option is to have Disciple of Alatar discard some number of cards, perhaps even your whole hand, when the ability is activated. This would make it more of an emergency option and you would have to fill up your hand again to use it. 

## 528 [Gizlivadi on June 2, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1645896)

All sound and valid opinions. I think we can all agree that the disciples are too powerful as they stand, but I disagree that Disciple of Alatar is that much better than Disciple of Pallando. At least in my experience there are shadow effects nowadays that are as bad or even worse than most treacheries. Especially the ones that kill your allies or reduce your action advantage (Attacking enemy makes an additional attack, exhaust a character you control, etc) That's why I thought these 2 abilities somewhat equivalent.

 

I really like Ian's suggestion, but if the cost was to discard all cards, etc, it could be very inconsistent, especially if your hand is really small. So how about for Disciple of Alatar: "Response: Discard 5 cards from your hand to cancel..." and for Disciple of Pallando: "Response: Spend 5 resources from Pallando's resource pool to cancel..."? That way the cost is more consistent. What do you think? Will post the fixed cards once we agree that the cards are balanced.

A new version of Last of the Seven I quite like. Could be devastating but with a big risk. Otherwise you can just "safeuse" it and add up to 3 resources as if with Steward. It could even be a replacement for Steward in Dwarf decks, but not as broken and thematically accurate. Would love if FFG made something like this.

Ok .. For example your hero with "Last of the Seven" attached has 2 resources in hins pool. Now, you raise your thread by X, to add X resources to the hero's pool, where X is the number of resources the hero has now in his pool.

 

So .. if your hero has 7 resources after that action .. what is X? 5.. or 7?

To sum up Galdor: (Because a simple No is not very productive)

you get a free resource and a free draw and a free discard (that can prove really really powerful with hidden cache) for the risk of losing all your hand?

Each time you quest unsuccessfully is not happening often, moreover for a 3-quest 8-cost hero! 

His capacity is making an easy game (were you can quest successfully each time) more easy, and with 3 willpower, only 8 threat, 1 ressource, 1 card, 1 discard (wich, I repeat, is super powerful), it's quite overpowered.

The drawback feel somewhat poor to counteract it.

edit: But isn't the Man in the picture Tuor, bringing word to Turgon that Gondolin would soon fall? That was what I seemed to remember, hence the defence effect. I might be mistaken.

The card makes it sound like you can play it from your discard pile without another card's help, so at first I thought it was insanely overpowered. Then I read your description and it made more sense. I like it, but I don't personally think Spirit needs it as much as some of the other spheres. In any case, it is insanely powerful, but may be restricted enough to warrant it.

As he mentions, currently the only way to play it is with Map of Earnil, which would shuffle it back into the deck. He doesn't intend for the card to be able to be played at any time... it needs a card effect that allows you to play something from your discard pile.

## 552 [Edvando on June 24, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1670019)

I think that The Furthest Seas is too much gimicky and unclear. Almost impossible to play, since you need to discard, need map (so probable a mono spirit deck) and Noldor hero.

 

A overhaul to the card is needed. You could do something similar to Flashback in MTG, would work much better.

Ah yes I forgot the books put the card at the bottom of your library and not back in the discard pile....

I have to say its a little strange it can ONLY be played using Map of Earnil........ also wasn't Earnil one of the Gondorian Kings? Not sure why a card that is all about the Noldor can only be played using a map that once belonged to a Gondorian King?

Still really love the actual effect of the card but the discard pile mechanics seem wrong for this card.

 

what about:

Blood of the Firstborn

0 Cost - Spirit

Action: 

Choose and ready a Noldor Hero. That hero gets +1W, +1A and +1D and does not exhaust to defend until the end of the round. During the refresh phase exhaust chosen hero rather than readying them. Hero cannot be readied by card effects during the following round.

Yeah, I only made this decision because we're pretty much guaranteed to receive Noldor abilities that allow us to play things from the discard pile, but Map of Eärnil is the only way it could be useful as of now. (Maybe Eärnil's map from the Minas Tirith archives points to the location his ancestor Tuor met Ulmo and learnt about the fall of Gondolin? Bit of a stretch.) And correct, it should definitely have Victory 1 or something, though that contradicts the Map's final effect.

I would have worded it differently but it is certainly interesting. I also don't think I am as in love with the idea as much as you since that situation doesn't generally become all that big of an issue usually. If an active location prevents me from getting to the quest card too much, then I would rather clear the location anyway. I can definitively think of some times when it would have been great but still seems rather situational to me.

## 566 [Mndela on July 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1683829)

It is like Fatty: there are moments that it will be very very good. For example, when you have to advance and quit out a hard quest card and no other way to increase your wp. Or Legolas, you want to use Legolas in combat to advance of quest card, but you wouldnt travel, or Ravens of the Mountain, etc. Or Into the Pit Nmare 2b, or Flight From Moria when you have tools..., there are a lot of nice uses for this card.

 

And also is good for the new hobbit ally:

 

Curious-Brandybuck.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wastes-of-Eriador/Curious-Brandybuck.jpg]

 

If the actual round has not revealed locations and there is no locations in staging are to travel..., seems little annoying to have to discard Brandybuck. With this card, it wont be problem.

I agree. I do not believe the card is useless by any means; it's just one of those cards that is situational enough that it will rarely see the light of day. I think it would be a wonderful addition to the card pool though because it is quite unique, potentially very useful, and decently costed.

I like this card. In combat it is essentially a feint, but that leave you open for nasty shadow cards, but help you cushion risky undefended attacks. Exhausting the character seems a reasonable additional cost.

 

My only questions is how that card interact with Archery? Would it prevent all archery?

Too expensive? Imrahil, Boromir... it is powerful.

 

Well, rohan can be included (Eomer, Theoden...) by the event that each rohan becomes gondor (and I am not stranger... so each hero could be ranged by Earnur). And don't forget! The awesome Stewards of Gondor!!! The old king gives the future crown to the heir of gondor, he gives ranged ^^

You assign all the damage first, and you can't over assign. So it will prevent all the damage a character could have taken.

Well, you need to draw a card, and have it in first hand to play it first round, not like there isn't other method to begin with.

And here, it's 2 cards (the card you play + the card you draw) without even choosing the card you draw, to gain 2 ressource. I think it's not that much powerfull. Just like playing 2 Wealth of Gondor or the like.

It is like Walth of Gondor, but without trait restriction..., and you don't depend of exactly 2 copies of it. Only 1 copy of the Survival Instinct is enough to get the extra-resources.

 

And it is response, so you can trigger it at first round if you have it in the setup hand.

It depends on wether we're talking about first looking at the card or just blank discarding? If it's looking, way too powerfull. The first unique you draw is 2 resources for nothing. Also, any 0 cost or 1 cost cards give you a plus immediatly.

## 585 [Edvando on July 21, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1699558)

Wealth of Gondor has the restriction that you must have gondor and can only add resources for that gondor hero. You use one card to gain one resource.

Survival Instincts have you discard 2 cards, the survival and one card that you draw. The main restriction is that you don´t have much control in what you draw, so you could draw a good card and don´t want to discard. In this situation you must make a choice, wait one more turn or play it now, lose the card, but gain 2 resources that you can use immediate to play something.

Yes, Survival Instincts is much better then Wealth of Gondor, but Wealth is not a good card and Survival make you pay two cards now for 2 resources now, which is ok for a resource aceleration card. You are losing card advantage for a resource advantage.

I´ve never played Wealth, but Survival would find some spots in some decks.

I have just built a new deck with bormir leadership - denethor - eleanor. Trisphere gondorian deck to see how good can be Wealth of Gondor, after all, at first round.

A lot of gondor cards with 2 cost. Warden lore, Guard of the Citadel, Pelargir Ship Captain (to change resource of spheres), Herald of Anorien (very good first round also!), Envoy! (wow, first round, it continues changing resources....!),  and Stewards of Gondor, Visionary Leadership....

I have a deck (not gondorian) that can't do absolutely nothing first round, and seems this deck neither. But with Wealth of Gondor, the first round could be epic! I want to try this deck ^^

I´ve just played the whole Against the Shadow Cycle with Leadermir, Denethor and Beregond. Instead of Wealth of Gondor I was running Legacy of Númenor, which is a much better card =D

 

Of course, my deck has Beregond, so Is more able to defend a lot round one. But If I had Legacy, I could play almost my entire hand turn 1 and maybe leave 1 resource on Boromir, instead of 2 allies for 1 card. But I can see what you saying, wealth has it´s uses in a trisphere gondor deck, but still not a good overall card.

I really liked The Shadow. The dagger of westerness build in is fine. His second ability is too strong for the reason above. It should be a Encounter Action.

 

I like his second ability as a encounter action, because it let you engage two enemies per round. I´ve been playing a hobbit deck and one of the problems that I have is that I can only engage 1 enemy per turn, even If I wanted to engage everyone, I can only engage one optionally and the other wont engage because my threat is too low.

Sure, but as is, he can engage after attack phase for a "free feint" or during stating to remove threat, which is too powerful to be build in.

 

You already gave him free dagger, which is ok. Do you want to give him even more? His second ability should be really minor.

First of all - it's a paid ability. And its in Tactics, a sphere with 0 resource acceleration.

 

Second of all, for it to be a "free feint", as you call it, the player must have sufficient enough threat to not engage that enemy automatically in the first place. 

 

Third of all - removing it threat from the staging might be a decent way to go about Tactics questing, don't you think?

 

Fourth of all - for this "free dagger" you need to stay below the enemy in threat, which is problematic for tactics. Plus, his base attack is below average.

Pair him with Mablung, and it's a free ability. 

 

Pair him with hobbits, and you should be fine. And against high engagement enemies, he is too good. 

 

Agreed, but not as a cheap, repeatable hero action. Westfold outrider is a good example of an appropriate cost. 

 

Pair with hobbits, or don't run mono-tactics. No one said you have to run the shadow with Tactics Aragorn and Beorn. 

## 602 [John Constantine on July 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1704669)

Nothing is free. In your case, the cost is including the hero that would negate the downside of another hero's ability. 

 

And what is he going to do against those enemies with hobbits? 4 attack is still not enough to take down most of foes, and hobbits are not much of the help on the matter. And, in time, you're going to reach the threat where his ability would simple not activate. 

 

1 resource is not cheap, 1 resource is the whole turn worth of his resources. It's once per turn. Westfold outrider is a bad example, because: a) he's an ally, and a cheap one; b) he can do his action even when exhausted.

You make a good point. Part of the 'cost' of his ability is that you really want to include Mablung and/or hobbits in your team. That limitation to optimal potential teams means he's not inherently overpowered. 

 

He only has 4 attack when naked. Throw a dagger or two on him and he's a machine. 4 attack out the gate is better than every single hero but Beorn (and Bard or Tactics Aragorn in a way). I actually don't dislike his attack boost on its own, but it's too much when coupled with his engage ability. 

 

And I simply don't agree with you on the hobbit point. Sam is a wonderful hero that can be augmented to help The Shadow take down tough enemies. And Sam would often ready when the engage ability is used. Merry, SMerry, or Pippin can also be great teammates for The Shadow. 

 

Of course 1 resource isn't insignificant, but it also isn't a high enough cost for a repeatable feint. Wouldn't you agree that the earliest rounds are the most crucial? When your threat is low and you're trying to build up your forces? That's exactly when The Shadow is at his best. He can ensure that the other two heroes in his team can dedicate themselves to questing and keeping threat low, while he pulls and kills enemies without a fight. 

 

I don't see how Westfold outrider is a bad example. He has a very similar effect, but at a higher cost: discarding a 2 cost ally. You actually have to draw him and make the choice to sacrifice him for a great effect. I think he's a fine counter example to The Shadow's easy and repeatable action. 

 

I quite like the idea of a seedier, common scout Hero. Anther scout hero would be nice, and I think the basic concept of an ambusher is promising. And I always love to see custom heroes, because they are so much fun to dissect and discuss (and because I'm a coward who won't share his own concepts). 

## 604 [John Constantine on July 27, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1705248)

Eomer has 5 attack when "naked".

 

Sam has more starting threat than hobbits usually do, and if you're including him, then there is not much room left for threat reduction.

 

It's not repeatable feint. It doesn't reads "Pay 1 resource to choose an enemy. That enemy cannot attack until the end of the phase/round.". It may give you a window to attack an enemy before it gets to act, but it would work only under certain circumstances, which are even harded to achieve hence the hero is in Tactics. "He pulls and kills" - there are a lot of enemies with low engagement costs, there are a lot of enemies with high health+def which will sustain him, he isn't a panacea.

 

And I do. Because comparing heroes and allies is incorrect in the first place. Discarding a 2 cost ally is not a higher cost. Exhaust and discard technicly would be, but not just discard. You will never see a clear picture when comparing different card types, never. Now what we can compare Shadow to is Tactics Aragorn which is completely bonkers. He can do the engaging stuff many times per round without flinching a finger, and he gets to do it while doing the one thing he is best at - attacking, and technicly, he has that 4 "naked" attack unless the enemies he is facing have printed 0 defense. Oh, and yeah, his armor reduction also helps not just him, but the entire team... and he does not hinders you resource-wise for this. All merely for 3 more starting threat.

I think that having just one of the abilities would be better and slightly more balanced. If you're going to give him both, you better do something to raise his threat a couple points.

I just realized that I've been over-exaggerating the power of The Shadow's engage ability. His ability is still more versatile and reliable (and costly) than that of Tactics Aragorn, who requires quick strike or similar cards to pull enemies out of staging during the quest phase. But then I compared The Shadow to Haldir (one of my favorite heroes) and I see that Haldir's pseudo-feint is in many ways more powerful than The Shadow's. Haldir doesn't need to pay a resource, and he can use his ability to save another player from an attack. Meanwhile, The Shadow is much less useful when paired with high-threat players, who will attract the enemies and eliminate the feint aspect of the Shadow's ability. But I still think his engage ability is very good for single player combat, when engagement is entirely under one person's control. Hama is also worthy of comparison, since he can cycle feint and pay 1 resource each turn, without being required to kill the enemy outright, though with the additional cost of card draw. 

 

But even if we were to ignore the usefulness of his ability in combat, The Shadow is wonderful for questing. His ability to remove enemy threat from the staging area is useful for any team. While I completely agree that tactics needs a boost to its questing capabilities, I don't think this is the answer. And it's not as though The Shadow forces you to run mono-tactics. I would gladly pay 1 resource to remove 2-4 threat from the staging area, or to pull a particularly sticky enemy from staging. The Shadow can pull Bill Ferny on turn 1, removing 3 threat from staging and accelerating the removal of a very annoying enemy. I think there needs to be some limitation to his engagement ability. Maybe it can't be used during the quest phase? Maybe it can only be used during X phase?

 

I don't mean to imply that he breaks the game or is too powerful to exist, and I'm sorry if I've seemed dismissive so far. It's just that his ability solves a tough problem in a very straightforward, easy way. 

## 607 [Edvando on July 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1706419)

Hama need to attack, need the card in the discard, you need to also discard a card from hand and pay for the event.

 

Haldir is one of the best heroes of the game. But he is offsphere for being a pure combat card and sometimes the deck reveal some cards that engage, which is somewhat common since he was released.

 

Aragorn is OP, but you still need to use events to help him and his high threat works against his Feint move. To feint you need to kill someone, so you need enough attack + quick strike, Feint + kill the guy, etc. Anyway, he is OP, but he is Aragorn and is printed. We cant do much against it. Same with Spirfindel, Dain, TBoromir, etc.

 

The Shadow ability is very reliable, you dont need to draw anything. You always can save one resource and if you playing him, you are playing low threat, which has its weakness and strengths. His ability is too versatile and all uses are event card worthy, even if they need some kind of condition.

 

Anyway, that is you card, you can do whatever you want =D

I like that Shadow better. The cost of a resource definitely helps prevent it from being too powerful. I was thinking that raising your threat by the enemy's threat would also be a good cost. That way he'd be similar to Fatty, except that you'd permanently take that enemy out of the staging area at the "cost" of having to fight the enemy yourself.

 

The two Orthanc characters are pretty cool as well. exhausting the characters for one progress or damage seems like a relatively steep cost and the reliability of having Doomed cards show up to trigger these makes the abilities something weak, but they make up for it a little with a "bonus stat point". If you can get multiple copies of each of these guys out and reliably play Doomed cards, then they can be pretty strong, especially when accompanied by a little more location control/direct damage from other cards.

Of course but sometimes you don't want to use those abilities during planning because you'll want to know what the best targets are after staging. Still shouldn't be too much hassle.

Orthanc Scout and Hunter does not need to exaust to trigger. They are not powerful enough to deserve that and their abilities need other cards or lots of doomed to do something, since pinging for one at location/enemies does not do anything unless you can do it a lot.

 

The new Shadow is much more manageable while still being really strong.

Arwen has a cool and useful ability! I´m not sure why did you penalize her with +1 threat and being incapable of triggering her ability on herself. She is not powerful, just useful.

 

When I first saw Hasty Arrivel I felt it was not doing enough and was created in the wrong sphere (which would be Leadership). In my mind it was a resource acceleration that made a 3 cost ally cost 2 and also dealt damage to it! Not good enough for costing one card. After thinking a while, I realized it can put into play allies from any sphere (so being better then first look) and that the card deal damage, so feel more like a tactic card to me. Not sure if this card would see much play outside a deck that want to play non-tactics cards, but has a niche to play so is a good designed card.

In almost every deck Southerner is a worse 2wp 2 cost ally with a little improved stats with an ability that want to quest every round. This card as printed today would be a binder card unless we see reasons to play Bree or Scouts in our decks. I think that you can safely give him -2 threat to enemy target, just to give him a little bit of usefulness by being a "3wp" if you have a enemy in staging, so filling a niche that he is useful at.

 

I really like Hidden Blade! His +2 is a lot less reliable then most tactics cards we have, which is OK, since it is a non-combat sphere. Perfect and elegant card.

I don't see how it's a lot less reliable than the tactics weapons that we have. Every ranger hero has 2 Willpower to start, so the hidden blade is a 1 cost weapon that gives +2 attack against a good fraction of enemies. If you boost them up to 3 Willpower, then there are very few enemies left that can overcome the boost. 

 

The Rivendell Blade, I grant you, is extremely reliable, since most enemies have 2 defense. The Bow of the Galadhrim's +2 is pretty reliable in multiplayer, but it requires a Silvan character with ranged. The Dagger of the Westerness is a favorite of mine, but its +2 depends on engagement cost, which is great for hobbits and other low threat decks, but not as good for a Dunedain ranger deck. And lastly, The Spear of the Mark is pretty unreliable, unless you go all out for a Dunhere deck. 

 

All in all, I think the Hidden Blade would be +2 more often than not, which would be an extremely powerful addition to a lore deck. I actually think the card should require the attacking hero to have a higher willpower than the enemy's threat. That would reward clever use of cards like Secret Vigil, Squint Eyed Southerner, and willpower boosting attachments to get the full effect.

As you said, all tactics weapons work 90% of the time in their decks. They have easier time triggering.

 

Hidden Blade is reliable against low threat enemies, but there is a lot of strong enemies with 3-4 threat that are common. Also, most bosses are 4-5 threat and against then that Hidden Blade is most required. I think hidden blade would work 70%, maybe a little less of the time. And that is OK, since its a weapon in a non-combat sphere, so it is not supposed to be as good.

 

Boosting WP is hard, costly and generally temporary. Unless you relying in Celebrían's Stone which is off-sphere, cost 2 and unique, you will have a hard time finding a good card that can be easily slotted.

 

 

> Didn't you noticed that Squint-eyed Southerner can enable Hidden Blade? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I did, still not good enough. He is off-sphere, cost 2 (so a lot harder to play), the enemy need to appear and stay alive for the turn, so next turn you can commit Southerner to -1 threat him. Man, this is a lot of work! Two cards across two spheres and letting enemy to stay in stating for another turn or attack twice. Hidden Blade can do work alone, Southerner alone doesn´t do much.

 

Just saying that you can safely buff Southern. Hidden Blade is already cool and good enough.

The main question is, do you need to use at least one resource of each sphere and provide a resource match for both, or can I play that card in a mono-sphere spirit deck?

 

The reason is the former would make multi-sphere a restriction and because of that you can have the card be a little bit more powerful, while the latter would make the card easier to play so being a advantage so the card need to be a little bit weaker then a mono-sphere card.

Do you realizes that he enters play attached to a quest card and stays there until that quest card is beaten, only then entering play under your control? You lose a resource with a chance of him not entering play if you can't quest through. And, ehm, for his effect to be effective (:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]), you need an engaged enemy, which is not usually a healthy practice. Also, quest stages are usually beaten during the quest phase and before enemies engage you, so that enemy of your will probably be from one of your previous turns, already issuing you some beating before you damage him with this ally.

Regardless of the trickiness of actually getting him into play, I agree with Mndela that the card is way undercosted. Even without looking at the other stats, 3 direct damage alone is a lot. The only other allies that deal direct damage are either in tactics (and the cheapest one, Galadhon Archer, only deals 1) or the expensive Longbeard Orc-Slayer and core Gandalf. And for 1 cost in Spirit? Man.

 

I like the overall idea of an ally that attaches to a quest card, though.

## 636 [John Constantine on August 7, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1725415)

And all alies you compare that deal damage, deal it immediately, and within much wider array.

 

This one will deal damage only when you advance the quest stage, and only if you have an engaged enemy at that time. It's a gamble, and if it'll cost 2 - this gamble simply wouldn't be worth it in most situations.

A hero (or ally) that can replace or add his defense after the shadow card from enemy is revealed, as a response, if other character was defending. Very good idea.

For stats reasons previously mentioned above, I think 1 is undercosted for the card even *without* a direct damage effect. Just considering the HP, only half of the 2-cost Spirit allies have 2 HP, and certainly none of the 1-cost ones (of which, admittedly, there are only three). Plus a Silvan Refugee's worth of willpower as soon as he enters play, plus 1ATK and DEF (none of the 1-cost Spirit allies have any ATK either)? Plus the -1 quest point effect? Barring the need to preserve my last Spirit resource for A Test of Will or something, I'd pretty much autoplay this every time it hit my hand (even knowing that it might be a while before he actually comes under my direct control), which I think makes it a little too powerful. It's really just the constellation of good effects he has. And if the direct damage didn't happen to hit, I'd just kind of shrug; I don't consider it the gamble you make it out to be.

 

Anyway, I've said my peace on this card, and again, I like the idea of an ally that comes into play when a quest card is completed.

Your problem is that you compare him to other allies without taking into account that the need to be attached to the quest and explored is a part of his cost, it's not just 1 resource.

## 642 [Ecthelion III on August 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1726164)

You can usually tell if a sidequest is going to be completed on a given turn. Thus, you play him under that sidequest on the turn you will complete it. (Plus, if the quest only needs 1 more progress token, you can complete it instantly.) It's like having an ally that costs 1 and says "on the turn you play him, you get to deal 3 damage to an enemy engaged with you but you can't commit him to the quest".

## 643 [John Constantine on August 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1726198)

No, you usually don't. I've had enormous amount of games when we struggled to clear a single quest stage at all.

 

Nope, it's like having an ally who enters play under the very specific circumstances, and if things don't go the way you planned - that doesn't enters play at all. And he has a specific target for this effect too, which was recently argued as not that viable in another thread.

This guy is OK people. He has lots of restrictions.

 

He is useless for the first few turns of the game, while you gearing up and dealing with the initial encounter setup that the quest dealt to you. The thing is, the first and second turn are the deal breaker of this game, win or lose situation. This card does nothing here.

 

His response need a lot of work to have it anything. You need to have a guy with 3 or less HP engaged at the exact time that you travel the quest. So, you engaged, survived one attack, dealt to enemy enough damage so he can die to 3 dmg, then you need to travel hard enough to complete, which some rare occasions can backfire since some treachery/enemy/location can foil your plan. I´d say that 50% of the time you don't actually use his response for something useful.

 

End game, he is a dead card on your hand.

 

After that you basically have a 2wp guy that cost 1 less. Great?

 

This card is cool and interesting. Also OK enough to be played, not even close to be a powerhouse.

Wow I had not seen this guy. I actually really like the design. Similar to The Long Defeat which was spoiled: which for a cost of 1 lore resource allows EACH player to heal 5 damage from among characters he controls or draw two cards when the quest card it is attached to leaves play. Similarly this card is quite a good deal for 1 resource but you need to beat the current quest card to reap any benefits. I think perhaps it should only do 2 damage and should not give the quest -1 progress but other than that I think it is well balanced. Otherwise it seems like a great card, both in design and power level. I for one sincerely hope we do get more cards like The Long Defeat that give us benefits for defeating a quest card. Will make the player side quests more powerful and playable too if you can load various other cards onto them for extra benefits.

I think this card is too strong as is. Tactics has a lot of good cards that can deal with enemies for 1 cost, such as Hands Upon the Bow, Feint and Quick Strike.

 

If you compare him with those, I would say it is a lot better, safer and more reliable. He even cancel the When Revealed (not sure, the wording is not 100% clear), which most of the above don´t.

 

This card deserve some nerf. Definitely a cost increase to two, maybe something more. The idea is really cool and flavorful, I like it.

## 647 [John Constantine on August 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1726511)

Cost is not just 1. It's an exhaustion of characters with combined attack of 5 or more. A Test of Will only costs 1, without any additional costs.

## 648 [Edvando on August 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1726524)

Well, with Feint you need to deal with the enemy threat, then exhaust enough people to kill, which is generally 2, some tough enemy is 3 guys (sometimes more). You can receive help from ranged, which is a plus. You have to deal with threat, when revealed, archery and engage effects.

 

Hands Upon the Bow need some setup with weapons or can only kill weak enemies, which is not ideal. Exhaust 1 ranged hero. The main advantage is that you deal with the enemy in staging, so you don´t need to deal with threat, archery and engage effects.

 

Quick strike is the weakest. You need a really strong guy, so need setup with weapons. Does not deal with engage, when revealed effects and threat. Main advantage is that you don't need to use a ranged guy.

 

Yours need to exhaust 2 heroes (one with 3 atk, other with 2 atk, can use allies also). Can be used with one guy with attachments (Eomer+Firefoot, Gimli+dmg, etc). It safely deal with when revealed, engage, threat, responses, everything. The cost of exhausting 5 atk is too cheap and easy to do.

 

Feint is one of the best cards of the game, Pushed Back is much better.

 

A Test of Will is one of the most overpowered cards of the game. That card is one of the reasons that some treacheries are really, really nasty, since you can easily deal with one card for one cost. There is no other card that compete with that one against Treachery, no competition what so ever.

## 649 [John Constantine on August 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1726542)

Feint allows you to deal with an enemy already on the board, who might have been added there by means other than being revealed, + you don't need feint, it's resources, and 5 staning attack at the very moment the enemy is revealed.

 

Also, my card doesn't discards the enemy, it shuffles him back, so you might as well encunter him again soon enough. And you judge it only by the situation with the clean board. With a clean board it's a no-brainer, with some enemies already around, you'll think twice before spending that 5 standing attack of yours. Also, you might not have exactly 5 attack at the time and you might overspend it with exhausting 6 combined attack. 

 

There is Eleanor, there is "The Door is Closed" or something event that is coming up.

## 650 [Edvando on August 8, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1726553)

Sure, feint is better in that situation, like Bosses (and many bosses are immune). The other 70% of the time, Pushed is better. You can play both in your deck.

 

Shuffle back in the encounter is a net zero effect unless the encounter deck is so thin that he for sure is coming back next turn (or even this turn!). If the deck is so thin, then killing the enemy has almost the same effect, since the discard is going to be shuffled. Also, he can be dealt as a shadow card and a lots of really nasty enemies have no shadow effects.

 

If I have enemies with engaged with me already, I prefer to shuffle the nasty crazy enemy back and deal with my enemies. I don't need more enemies that I have to deal with!

 

So if instead of Push Back I had feint when I had a enemy "B" engaged with me when I reveal a nasty enemy "A", now I have to deal with the new enemy archery/when revealed/threat/engage effect, feint him, attack to kill (if he is a nasty enemy "A", generally you need more then 5 attack) and also deal with my other engaged enemy. Or I can exhaust 5 attack (two guys, maybe one) to vanish the enemy "A" and deal with enemy "B".

 

You can safely make it cost 2 and it will still find a lot of spots in decks. For 1, it is crazy good.

Generally you use Eleanor as silver bullet to kill some encounter quests that have lots of terrifying treacheries and even there you also use A Test of Will, since it basically give you a free turn (because you don't reveal anything else, so one less enemy/location/treachery to deal with).

We Will Not Be Pushed Back should be better than Feint, because it costs more than Feint.

 

It's a huge luck factor. You can shuffle him into the 60 cards strong deck and draw him the next turn, or you can shuffle him into the 10 cards one and he will end up on the bottom.

 

Yeah, but if you exhaust those 5 worth of attack - you'll probably won't be dealing with those enemies engaged with you this turn, so they persist. 

 

There is a lot of stuff in the game already that is dozen times more powerful than this.

> We Will Not Be Pushed Back should be better than Feint, because it costs more than Feint.

 

Feint cost: The sum of the def+hp of the enemy in charachers to attack by exhausting to kill him + one round of Threat in staging + when revelaed/archery/engage/response. All of those you dont need to pay by using Push Back.

Even if you are incredible unlucky to find him in the very following card in this phase, you basically played Gildor's Counsel (-2 cost by exhausting 2 characters), because you revealed one less card. This is the worst case scenario and the card is still insane good. Gildor's Counsel is one of the best mono lore deck cards. Push Back is a lot easier to play.

If I don´t exhaust those 5 atk to Push Back, I still need to deal with 2 enemies, which entail Threat/Defending/Attacking for one more enemy. My example was comparing Feint to Push Back. It is better Push Back, has one less enemy to deal (less threat in staging, no reveal/archery/engage or whatever nastiness he has), then to use Feint. Feint has cost a LOT of indirect cost that you are not considering. Push Back is cheaper!

 

>  There is a lot of stuff in the game already that is dozen times more powerful than this.

 

Am I being a idiot and totally insane? Push Back is overpowered man, how can you not see it. It is a Gildor Counsel (cheaper, I would pay 2 exhaust for -2 cost every day of the week and is a response, so you dont need to play it blind), cheaper then Feint since the indirect cost is higher then 2 exhaust (unless boss or weird ways to put enemy into play) and can be played in the same deck as Feint (which you will save to use against the boss).

 

Sure, A Test of Will is overpowered, Steward is overpowered, Spirfindel is overpowered. Do we need more overpowered cards? So having stuff that is more overpowered then that overpowered card is not a good argument.

 

Not sure if I´m being trolled.

Feint cost: 1 resource any time. WWNBPB cost: 1 resource + exhaustion of 5 combined attack on characters you control, you need to have it exactly when enemy is revealed.

 

Gildor's Counsel is a guaranteed -1 for 2 more resources and 5 less standing attack exhausted. Seems fair to me, especially if we keep in mind that the are some quest phases where no enemies are revealed at all.

It is a two card combo, that cost 5 spirit resources and need to be done somewhat early in the quest to be effective. Most of the time stage 3 of the quest is very short, so you need to archive it at early stage 2.

 

It is actually hard to muster this combo. The main advantage is that you can bring the most suitable hero to help you delve the quest. Bringing Gandalf is awkward, I think the "a hero from any sphere" to the card text so you cannot bring back neutral heroes is deserved.

 

Beside that, the card is a risky proposition for the game. Balance wise it is OK. It is very unreliable and hard to muster. You can use the same resources to play 2 allies that actuly help you win the quest. Is a hero in the middle of the quest much better then 2 allies in play earlier, more reliable and flexibly? Also, Tragic Discovery/Fortune and Fate later in the game are dead card while more allies are not (unless you lose hero and have resources to spare, or is playing Eowyn+Caldara).

Sneaky Dunedain:

definitely agree that the downsides warrant a discount, but I don't think it warrants a discount of 2. 2 coast is probably better.

... Pushed Back:

I think exhausting multiple characters is a pretty large cost, so only having to pay 1 resource for it seems fine to me.

A Tragic Discovery:

This just makes me think of Sword Thain. I can see these cards used together to get 5 heroes (not including saga heroes). Would love to see someone pull it off.

With all that being said, I would like to reserve final judgment until the cards have been playtested, which is what I recommend everyone do. Don't get into heated debate until you've tested it.

How about instead of raising the threat cost, replace his "does not exhaust to quest" with the text: 

Response: After Gandalf commits to the quest, raise your threat by 1 to ready him. 

 

However, I think that the main source of his power comes from unrestricted ability to play cards of any sphere.

The first card is fine and cool.

 

The second card has a really strange wording in his second statement, I´m not entirely sure what it means. Does it basically cancel X+1, because it count itself?

Searing Devotion is balanced. It cost you: Doomed 1, 2 resources, an defense action (so you need to engage, take archery, overcome threat, etc) and a high willpower character. For that trouble you can kill a 3-5 hp monster, which there are a lot of nasty ones that need to be killed. Not as good as lots of tactics tricks, but is inside a non-combative sphere. Really like the card. Just think that "devotion" is a weird spell to sling around.

 

Alatar has the same problem as Glorfindel, which is arguable the best hero of the game. I think that every time he readies he should give you +1 threat, since he can easily use Expected Courage and Flame of Anor for great effect. He can even pair really nicely with Glorfindel in the same deck! You can quest, flame of anor, defend, shuffle flame of anor, attack. Full set of actions for 1 cost and one card.

That's what I had in mind. A hero with a half of his threat cost, but a forced effect that would eventually make up for it and overdo it, unless the player actively uses his other ability or side stuff.

Glorfindel's threat being dropped by 7 is ridiculous. Same here with Alatar. Unless the game is going badly, it generally won't go 7 rounds, so his negative will rarely actually counter the benefit of better starting threat. I think dropping starting threat by 4 or 5 is good, but 7 is too much. Otherwise, I love both of those cards.

I don´t see much advantage in using pitfall trap over poisoned stakes, even with stakes costing one more. Am I missing something?

 

Considering that poisoned stakes is not a good trap, pitfall trap seems really hard to include, even with the new lore trap hero.

 

That trap to work need 4 turns of the enemy alive and attacking/threatening every round. Poison at least let you do some other ways to hasten the enemy death (Hero Haldir, Direct Damage, etc). Also, pitfall trap even increases the enemy threat for some reason.

 

Not sure If I would ever find a spot for that card. Sorry for being harsh with the card, but I try to give my honest opinion.

He basically became the new OP Glorfindel that most decks that want to run spirit will use. He is slight different, but does has the same function, maybe even better then Glorfindel in lots of situations. He definitely and safely deserve some kind of nerf.

 

His powerfull stats, allied with low cost, turn him in a easy include in most decks. Also, his ability let him use any spell for double duty, as per spell card text + action economy for Alatar. Which is fine, but when summed with cost reduction is too much.

I would keep Glorfindel instead of Alatar simply for Asfaloth  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Honestly I think that the biggest problem with Glorfindel is Asfaloth and not the hero himself.

If Asfaloth still placed 2 progress when attached to other noldor/silvan heroes but cost less to play on Glorfindel (maybe 3 cost or 2 cost on Glorfindel) I think many people would instantly drop Glorfindel for Spirit Merry or other similar heroes. Then LoV could go on someone else like Elrond as well..... 

It is pretty super frustrating that the most powerful location control card (by a long long margin) goes hand in hand with Glorfindel and is far less powerful/not worth it if you are not playing him. I know for me personally Asfaloth was the one single reason I was not able to make the change from Glorfindel to Galadriel or Spirit Merry. 

Until we get something as powerful and repeatable for locations as Asfaloth is Glorfindel will always stay in my decks as location lock is just too crappy a way to lose and without Asfaloth I find it happens far too often in quite a few quests and especially in nightmare where locations have FAR MORE quest points and threat.

I have looked through many many cards that you have made (assuming you are reincarnated trololo) and I just think you overdo it on the ready effects in general, although Gimli's is particularly creative and cool. As for Legolas, I love the effect. It is like Dwalin (one of my favorite heroes, actually) but I would personally like to see the effect in red. This is similar to Mablung having resource excel outside purple. IMO tactics can and should do basically everything as long as it is tied to combat in some way and I feel that the main reason spirit is OP is that it is the only color with reliable threat reduction. Basically, I think your Legolas would be a great tactics hero and I even predict we will eventually see a hero with almost that exact design.

## 687 [PsychoRocka on September 4, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1772993)

Yeah I really like the design of these heroes as well. That Legolas ability is dope but might have to have a limit (maybe twice per turn?). Would love to see a hero with a similar design to this one day. I would also love this on an Elladan hero in spirit as an alternative to his tactics incarnation.

First off, a disclaimer: I've never liked the Beorn hero that much and have always wanted a different version of him.  But I always wanted to capture his ability to shape-change and I felt the best way to accomplish this was to actually have a double sided card.  Also, I know I crammed a lot onto these cards, but I wanted him to offer more than just some stats or some way to increase his stats.

Ace design on Legolas and Gimli. Don't know what spheres they fit in best, but ace design.

Beorn is really cool, but I'd drop the cost reduction from the human-form (and some threat), and I would remove the "ready and draw 1 card" if the enemy is destroyed. A built-in swift strike is good enough, freeing you from dealing with that attack if the enemy is destroyed. Being able to do that while exhausted is almost overpowered. Readying and drawing 1 card is waaaay over the top. That's a built in double action advantage (quest, attack while exhausted, then ready to attack again or defend), in some cases.

I think a two sided hero is a great idea and obviously Beorn is ideal for that. Making the flip a valour action is a great idea.

Beyond that, the cards are WAY too busy. Just the flipping and no attachment restrictions (etc.) are enough. The rest is just annoying and overly complex. The hero needs to be far more elegant.

Really nice batch of heroes there John. I also like the Beorn flip hero, but I think there is a bit too much text and the abilities need to be streamlined. The spirit Legolas is very good, but the Gimli less so (IMO). Maybe if I were to actually play with the card I would feel differently though.

Speaking in general now, I have been thinking about spirit/lore versions of the ninja twins and I keep coming back to wondering why we seem to constrain new hero versions to having the same stats as the old ones?

I personally do it because it's the way actual game designers are handling the matter. It's some sort of an unwritten rule for me. There is a couple of an unisgnificant breakings of this rule within the game, but I prefer sticking to it.

I understand Beorn is "busy" but honestly I'd like to see a more complex hero.   The neutral human side of Beorn is good on his own, but is 3 points low considering his stats vs starting threat.  That is part of the balancing reason I wanted the bear side to be so strong.   Also, since you can't flip him until you hit 40 or higher threat, I wanted him to be useful on his own.  Thematically, I felt he was best as a neutral hero and so in order to get any use out of his resources I included the ability to pay for Mount and Creature cards. This plays into his ability to speak with animals and hanging out with more intelligent creatures.  I toyed on and off with the cost reduction.  I can see giving it up.   After you reach the 40 threat range, you can exhaust Beorn to turn into a bear and flip the card.   I wanted there to be a cost to switching - since you have to exhaust him you don't get to use human Beorn for defending, etc. - into the more tactical and offensive bear.  (attachments also fall off of the bear form)  But I also wanted to have something that targets his most hated enemies of Goblins and Orcs.  I can see giving up the stand or draw, but unless you are playing some of the early quests just having 5 attack isn't going to be killing much any more.  Most enemies are not that squishy so I felt it was still justifiable.  New player cards always make the old quests easier.  That can't be helped since the new quest cards continue to get harder, more shields, more health, toughness, etc.

 

I also liked the concept of the bear side having more health, but regular healing not working on him.   So he could take too much damage as the bear and then not be able to revert back without sacrificing some creatures or mounts.

 

Honestly the more I think about it, he could be a threat of 13 or 14.  even with the removal of the cost reduction and the standing effect.    

 

To make it less of a quick strike I could change it to a response after resolving a Goblin or Orc enemy attack against you, he can swing for free, even if exhausted?

Sorry! I totally missed the fact that he's a neutral hero, which makes the cost reduction a little more sensible, as he's "costing" you one resource per turn which you can't use on colored cards. I'm still not sure about it, but it's less serious now, I think. And I think he makes perfect sense as a neutral hero. 

 

And how about losing at least the "draw one card" stuff? The thematic representation of card draw is usually knowledge, and I don't see how this fits Beorn. Maybe have him spread damage with his big paws, so after he deals any amount of damage to an enemy engaged with you, deal one damage to another enemy (or two? seems strong) engaged with you? I'd prefer damaging more enemies to readying and card draw. Maybe place one damage on one more enemy engaged with you, and if you're engaged with four or more enemies, place another one damage on another enemy engaged with you. I'm seeing him flailing around the battlefield, taking down several orcs with one fell swoop. The more he's surrounded, the angrier and stronger he becomes.

Well, this is my first try at making a custom card, so go easy on me.   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I guess it probably has been done at least a few times already, but I felt like giving Magali's second beautiful treatment of Arwen a hero version.

 

Arwen-Undoacutemiel-Front-Face_zpswho4wy [http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac21/narubianHorror293/Custom%20LotR%20LCG%20Cards/Arwen-Undoacutemiel-Front-Face_zpswho4wyxr.jpg]

 

First, I think that she's a viable hero by the virtue of her stat line alone;  She has the lowest starting threat of any hero with 3 willpower short of Sglorfindel, even lower than Sam's. This because she has almost no "wasted" points. As we know from heroes like Beregond, Eowyn and Galadriel, single purpose heroes with dedicated stat lines are a rare and precious thing. Also, Spirit only has three heroes with 3 or more willpower - Sglorfindel, Eowyn and Galadriel (and beardy, soon, of course). So she's a nice alternative to Eowyn if you don't want to run her, or specifically want to run a Noldor, or maybe you are playing multiplayer and Eowyn is taken and you need a cheap spirit quester (Galadriel doesn't quest from turn one, so it's not exactly the same part).

 

Second, I wanted to give her a cool and thought-provoking ability that is not straight out strong, and reflects her role in the books. Obviously, it couldn't be something confrontational, but rather something that represent the way she provided support and willpower to others; her general role in motivating Aragorn for sure, but also specific acts like making the Livery of Elendil herself, which her brothers then take to Aragorn before he enters the Paths of the Dead, and her noticing and taking care of Frodo's illness after the War of the Ring by giving him her "spot" on a ship to the undying lands and a white gem she wore on a chain. Also, since we know Celebrian gave here the Elfstone/Elessar, but also that Galadriel gave it to Aragorn when the Fellowship visits Lorien, I think it is safe to say that she asked Galadriel to give it to Aragorn as a gift and a boon.

 

I hope this manages to stay close to her ally ability, but still giving it an interesting twist. She is a classic quester in that you know that you almost always want to quest with her, as her ability doesn't clash with it. However, rather than a static boost, it gives you the ability to return a questing character to defend from some unexpected enemy that will engage you, in case you miscalculated. Of course, you can also use this just to get +1 defense on a character meant to defend from an enemy already engaged with you, but you then run the risk of not having that character ready to defend if no enemy shows up, which means you have to think a little (which I like about abilities), and that the ability is stronger when combined with the right elements/mechanics (which I also like), in this case scrying.

 

Second, I knew I wanted to give her a version of the Elfstone:

I would have preferred calling it Stone of Eärendil, but this had to be the same name as the core set one as this is the same item. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm not 100% sure about the sphere; I think giving willpower makes sense, atleast considering the hope it was meant to give to Aragorn, and the version of the story where Celebrimor makes a second Elessar, after the first was lost, to bring joy and hope to Galadriel. However, it was also specifically said that "the hands of one who held it brought to all that they touched healing from hurt", so I wanted it to have some healing effect, hence my uncertainty between Lore and Spirit. Giving Arwen a lore icon when she wears it emphasizes more the healing powers of the stone, and Arwen's special ownership and connection to the stone (she did receive it from her mother and carried it for who knows how many years). Finally, in the 17 years in which the game takes place, it might as well be in the possession of Arwen, as she might have given it to Galadriel just a short while before the fellowship forms.

 

So, what do you think?   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Add in a restriction that you need to have at least X cards, like say 3, in hand, otherwise it would be really strong. Or is it meant to be mulligan your hand: discard all your X cards to draw X cards?

I don't know if it is too strong. But yes, you can do it always you want, with the cards you have, without limits (only the limit 1 per round). If you have 10 cards in hand, you reshuffle the hand into your deck and draw 10 cards. If you have only 2 cards, same with those ones.

> What Horn of Gondor should have been, in my opinion:

I think that a zero-cost +1 willpower attachment for tactics, even unique, is too sphere-breaking. If tactics get some +willpower ability, it should be related to combat somehow (which is kind of hard to do, since questing is done before combat).

 

How about this:

Horn-of-Rohan-Front-Face_zpsplmxbdiy.jpg [http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac21/narubianHorror293/Custom%20LotR%20LCG%20Cards/Horn-of-Rohan-Front-Face_zpsplmxbdiy.jpg]

 

I think this is more in line with the concept of Rohan getting willpower when allies leave play, but this also enables tactics heroes in general to benefit from this ability, although this obviously has a lot of synergy with Rohan decks.

 

P.S.

This probably should say "attach to a hero", although I don't mind attachments that attach to allies.

Nope, it's not. And Tactics could enjoy something like this. Regardless, a single card will not change the matters, especially by giving +1 willpower to a single hero. 

 

Do you realize that Horn of Gondor comes from the core set, and the way you made it - it would be literally unplayable in the core set? And your version completely kills the identity of the card itself. 

 

Mndela, Favor of the Lady is a pointless, overpriced card which is never used because of these obvious reasons. And no, it was not Horn of Gondor. Horn of Gondor does not exhusts to give resources, allowing you to load attached hero with resources in the multiplayer, while my version does not allows more than 1 resource per turn, hence the cost of 0 and small benefit on top of it, which I added because I felt that card that capitalizes on your losses should provide some bonus meanwhile, and a little bit of willpower seems nice.

I don't think the Horn should be exhausted to gain the resource and I agree that the static willpower boost doesn't belong in Tactics. It seems better as a spirit card to me.

I think NarubianHorror made something that works well as a Horn of Rohan, though it isn't very related to Constantine's version.

I'm not sure why you didn't just make it exhaust to give 1 willpower as a response rather than going through all that weirdness of not reading and then reading as a response.

Elaborate, please. Have you played a 3-4 player game with the Horn of Gondor? Have you seen the piles of resources it generates? And about static Willpower boost not belonging to Tactics - Theoden ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I renamed it from the Horn of Gondor into the Horn of Rohan because of one simple reason - leaving play is Rohan specialty. I didn't wanted to change the core item mechanic.

## 718 [joezim007 on September 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1782783)

I guess if you look at Horn of Gondor from a 3+ player perspective, it is very powerful. I almost never exceed 2 players, so I didn't think it was too bad. Still, I think you drastically reduce its power by limiting it to once per round, which I guess is fair, since Tactics shouldn't have stronger resource generation than Leadership.

Theoden is also a bit of an exception, so saying that you can have static willpower boosts in Tactics, citing him as an example, isn't a strong argument. Generally, if you are doing things that are the specialty of another sphere, you give it some kind of flavor that makes it fit into the new sphere. Secret Vigil is an excellent example. NarubianHorror's card is another decent example. I will not generally approve of giving Tactics willpower without it being triggered by some sort of Tactics-based trigger.

I agree that Horn of Gondor fits better with the synergy of Rohan and so should be named Horn of Rohan. I also believe that your card is a good card and is quite thematic. I just think it fits better in Spirit. I also think it should probably cost 1 instead of 0.

The more I think about NarubianHorror's card though, the more I feel that it's just an even weaker version of Favor of the Lady on the Tactics sphere. Doesn't seem like it would ever get played even though it brings willpower to Tactics because 1 willpower isn't gonna make much difference. I DID figure out why he made the odd mess with not readying and such though, which makes it slightly better, but still weak.

## 719 [DukeWellington on September 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1782885)

I think one resource per round is maybe too much of a nerf, but I have no problem with +1 willpower in tactics, especially for a unique attachment. I'm not even sure it would make most decks.

This brings up something else in my mind, which is a lack of dedicated questing heroes, particularly in tactics. Other than Thalin there really isn't one, and I think such heroes can be quite interesting. What if the Horn said something like this:

"Attach to a (tactics) hero. Attached hero get +1 (willpower). As long as the attached hero is committed to the quest it gains "Response: After an ally you control leaves play add 1 resource to attached hero's resource pool. (Limit 3 times per round)"

Then the resource ability has a more interesting restriction.

## 720 [John Constantine on September 9, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1783141)

Saying that Tactics can't have willpower isn't argument at all, it's just an opinion, which is already thwarted by the game designers themselves. And, again, 1 willpower on 1 unique Tactics item in the game will change nothing, I added it only because the power of the item went down significantly with the introduction of exhaustion. I could easily add some Tactics-based trigger to it, but: 1) it's 1 willpower, 2) it would make a core set card too busy with text.

 

I reduced cost from 1 to 0 because of the exhaustion again. Steward of Gondor, for example, pays for itselfs immediately upon entering play, while Horn may not, and it also gives resources when people leave play, which is usually a bad thing, so, from my point of view, giving it the cost of 1 in the current state might put it too far behind.

 

 

DukeWellington, this restriction could be interesting, but the main "leaving play" action usually happens during the combat phase, and I think restricting it to the quest phase (and only working while hero is questing) would limit it even more than just once per turn.

Well, that's your opinion.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Obviously, I didn't meant my opinion is the god-given truth, only that that is how I feel about the card. I personally think that willpower boosts in tactics should be dependent on combat-related triggers. I think tactics Theoden should be considered the exception, because I believe that if it is taken as the rule, and we have even just one or two more static, unconditioned willpower boosts in tactics - like your card - mono-tactic decks will be able to quest quite successfully (and it might be not too hard to achieve), which I think shouldn't be the case.

 

As to the core set thing - I didn't realize you we're aiming to design a card that will go into the core set. I wasn't, in any case; I was rather aiming to design a card that would play nicely with the current card pool and meta, and will sit along side Horn of Gondor rather than replacing it. Furthermore, if core set is what you're aiming for, I think your card will be even more of a sphere-breaker in the core set, because the willpower boost for tactics precedent was not set then (not suprising, given there are exactly two tactics cards in the entire game that even have the willpoer symbol printed in the card text - Theoden and Halfling Determination), and it would have made the borders between the different spheres less clear and sharp, which I think is important in the core set, as it sets the tone and player expectations for the rest of the game.

 

Regarding the identity of the card, I think my version really kind of captures it, as it uses one of the thematic ways in which the spirit and will of Rohan characters are represented in the game, where much of their power and motivation comes from characters dying (being discarded). I even think that getting willpower from characters dying is more of a Rohan thing (think Ride to Ruin, although that's progress and not willpower), where imagine them getting all pumped and excited with some speeches about their fallen comrades, while getting resource out of discarded characters feels more Gondor like, and even specifically Horn of Gondor-like, as a dying character (Boromir) blows the horn in his last moments to summon more allies (resources to pay for them), or perhaps Gondor sends more forces to where a military defeat has occurred. That's the way I imagine it, anyway.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  

 

Finally, from your tone I get the feeling you were offended by my reply, and even that you are generally offended by my version of the card. I don't think it's that bad!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Anyway, my point is that I think this thread - and this forum generally - are for us to share our opinions and discuss this game that we love so much. Specifically, I think you can expect to always gets some comments and discussion on your creations that you post here - and that is a good thing. In my reply, I meant only to convey my opinion about the card, and to develop a discussion regarding this idea that intrigued me; I don't think that your card is wrong, or that you're stupid and that you don't "get the game!" or don't "get the meta!". I simply have a different idea on how to translate a concept from the books to card form, and how it combines in the current card pool. 

 

I'm generally a guy who prefers subtler cards with subtle effects, that combine in some small ways with cards released all throughout the game, and that require building around them, and matching them to the correct deck type and mechanics to get them to work - and even then they should only be pretty good, only one part of a well-oiled machine. In MtG terms [http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr11b], I'm a Johnny.  I don't think that I would ever design a card that is outright strong and that is almost an auto-include in any deck, like your card (zero cost for +1 willpower, for me at least, means auto-include in any tactics deck). And that's OK. It's OK we have different opinions about things, and I think we should keep discussing them without using offending language ("kills the identity" was kind of strong, I think. It's not nice to read that about something you did :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] ).

 

 

> I'm not sure why you didn't just make it exhaust to give 1 willpower as a response rather than going through all that weirdness of not reading and then reading as a response.

 

Because usually allies leave play during the combat phase, so that would mean only getting the boost when you trigger some effect with an ally that can choose to leave play, or when a treachery kills an enemy. Which is even less-powerful and more subtle. I like it! (if you read the previous part of this reply, you know that that's my thing). I think that a one-cost attachment that says "While committed to a quest, attached hero gains "Response: after an ally leaves play, ready attached hero. It gets +1 willpower until the end of the phase. (Limit 3 times per phase.)"" will be pretty cool!

 

I would like to try and make it work in a deck that fits this mechanically (Rohan + Silvan? Or a two handed Rohan deck + Silvan deck?). It wouldn't be very strong; which is good. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

> The more I think about NarubianHorror's card though, the more I feel that it's just an even weaker version of Favor of the Lady on the Tactics sphere.

Yeah, now you see why it's needed.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I don't think that it will never get played - I think that's a harsh thing to say about any card, especially given the diverse player pool we have, and given how much this game enables you to try weird and experimental deck designs (given that it's solo/cooperative rather than competitive). I like that it's subtle and will be outright weak when played in an unsuitable deck.

 

> I think one resource per round is maybe too much of a nerf, but I have no problem with +1 willpower in tactics, especially for a unique attachment. I'm not even sure it would make most decks.

 

I think some limitation should be in place. Maybe twice per round? I think you wouldn't want to see Tactics exploding with resource.

 

> I reduced cost from 1 to 0 because of the exhaustion again.

I think it's ok that a resource generation option for tactics won't pay itself in the round it enters play. It's a sphere that should struggle a bit with resources, so this is a short term investment - in an appropriate deck, it will pay itself back in a round or two.

I believe I've clearly stated in the post with the card that this is how I think that card should have been made in the first place. And this card is from the core set, so yes - it should be playable in the core set at the very least. And nope, it won't be a sphere-breaker even in the core set, because core set features a lot of willpower boosts across all the spheres, single unique Tactics card will not make a difference, nor will it cross those borders you're talking about.

 

You missed my point about the indentity. The identity of the original is giving resources for characters leaving play. Your version destroyed that, so it erased the card identity. You've just made another card with the same name. And Gondor theme gameplay-wise is not related to leaving play, that's why I renamed it into the Horn of Rohan in the first play - because Rohan theme is related.

 

Man, no offense intended or taken, it's just the way I speak. Maybe it's cultural or something, I don't know. 

 

The problem is - it's so conditional, in certain situations it might not pay for itself throughout the couple of rounds, or get discarded by a treachery or shadow before it manages to pay for itself at the very least. The LotR is pretty hard game already.

> Ey! Interesting.... isnt?

 

It is! Very neat idea! It's only half a hero - only resources, not the hero type - so it's not a sword thain, and can only replace a dead hero. I like it a lot! I don't know if it's too strong with 1 cost (given that hero resurrection cost 5, and that sword thain is 4), but I think with either 1 or 2 it's an incredibly solid design. Good job!

I think it should be once per round at 2 damage or just 1 damage once per phase. Rumour from the Earth becomes a potent healing event with the current version since you can recur it once per phase as long as you have the resources.

 

Also, consider that most repeatable healing is still pretty expensive compared to your card. To heal 2 damage once per round is typically 3 resources (Daughter and Self-Preservation). Warden of Healing is 2 damage, but not from the same character at once.

 

Have you thought about a version where you can discard X cards to heal X damage on a character once per round? Still powerful when you have to heal, but probably a bit more tame than the current version. Not to mention the Noldor mechanics we're starting to see more of.

The Noldor theme Glorfindel and the Spirit Boromir are both sick. I personally appreciate how neither one has a ready effect, yet both are creative, powerful, and inspire deck design.

Thanks! But I have a question. While I understand how Lore Glorfie can inspire deck design - his ability works with discard pile, and that's a theme that is currently being developed, plus there are deck shufflers and deck searchers that could utilize that sort of ability. But Spirit Boromir? What kind of deck design do you think it inspires? First thing that comes to my mind is healing, but that will have to be balanced out if you want to utilize his gain in willpower (that is if you really want to :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).

 

On a side note, here is a core-sety Leadership version of Denethor. Who needs that flimsy attachment when you can have the real stewards kickstarting you from the very beginning? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Too powerfull... in a secrecy deck with some resourcefull, it's just free willpower stacking each turn... Just a +1 if it has at least 1 would be good.

Spirit Boromir- right off the bat I would pair him with lore Pippen and another hobbit. Hobbits are squishy and although lore Pippen is one of my all time favorite heroes, he dies a lot to treacheries because of his low health. Boromir would mitigate the weakness (on theme, btw). Also, his ability is kind of like Gimli's so you think of ways to direct damage his way for better questing, while (in addition) also having some ready effect to utilize his high attack.

That's just off the top of my head. I'm sure there is a lot more.

Yes Théodred would be too powerful. Considering that he has easy access to Steward of Gondor he will pretty soon quest for 10+.

Those are valid points on Theodred, but it requires a pretty hard, from my perspective, thing to do - not spending resources. How are you going to handle non-questing matters or early game without spending a dime?

 

However, I've implemented this little limitation that should prove sufficient enough:

Unstable Spell costs too much for something that gives you +2 attack for a single attack and discards its owner  unless you manage to utilize it.

 

Unwilling Recruit will be hard to utilize via his text because most of the stuff is going to kill him instantly, and healing itself is in another sphere.

 

+3 Attack for an entire additional encounter card is extremely questionable for me.

Sorry, but putting artists names onto cards like this is too much for me, I do this kind of stuff on impulse. You can always ask me for the artist names, and I will always provide you with their names if I do indeed possess them.

 

In this case, the artists are: dashinvaine, Magali Villeneuve.

I love this idea. You could also have a spirit attachment that lets you choose +1 WP or -1 Threat, a lore attachment for +1/-1 hit points, and a tactics attachment for +1/-1 defense.

Works well with dunedain. Many enemies -1 attack is powerful if you have a lot engaged.

## 755 [Mndela on September 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1801331)

Usually, one scenario has a lot of enemies with same trait, but not always. Anyway, sure... it is very powerful.

 

Broken Sword is +1 wp for each character you control, without taking care of traits. So Advantage is Our, by same cost, probably is not overpowered (note: Broken Sword is strong, sure ^^)

## 756 [koriakin97 on September 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1801502)

Still, in 2 player game if both players focus on e. g. Gondor, you can basically give all characters +1 attack. And you can always swap this for lowering attack of the enemies, so it's very versatile. I would make leave only +1 or -1, not both.

## 757 [Mndela on September 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1801572)

Probably.

If it is +1 for characters, could be restricted only for 1 player.

 

Anyway, if your deck is all focused in 1 trait. You have a permanent ForGondor event for 3 cost. By other side, Sword Broken is +1 wp for everybody, and willpower is more expensive than attack usually.

## 758 [koriakin97 on September 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1801688)

How do you make For Gondor pernament for just 1 additional cost?

## 759 [Mndela on September 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1801707)

I mean Avantage is Our can be similar effect than For Gondor. For Gondor is +1 attack each character, and Avantage is Our can be the same if each character shares same trait.

Then, Avantage is Our is attachemtn, not for only 1 use like events..., adn Avantage is Our costs 3 tokens, while For Gondor only 2.

This is why i say Avantage is Our is a permanent For Gondor for only +1 cost

## 760 [DurinVoronwe on September 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1801800)

I still think the lowering the enemies attack is a far better option and you can´t compare that with Sword that was Broken. It will not work against some scenarios, but when not playing any of them, this will make dunedain far better. And when you not need enemies engaged, choose attack to dunedain and kill them all very fast. If it only was one of the effects, that would still be powerful. I like the attack lowering more, so I would keep that one and remove the other.

## 761 [Mndela on September 17, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1802760)

Yes, it makes sense. Very fun the -1 attack on one trait enemy. But if it is only the unique effect, then 2 cost would not be bad.

 

Thinking about dunedain:

Attach to a dunedain hero

2 cost

Leadership - attachment

Response: after you engage an enemy, exhaust Advantage is Our to lower the attack of each enemy that shares trait with engaged enemy by 1 , until the end of the round.

 

Interesting, for sure

I like it more that way. And dunedain would be much stronger, maybe even other combinations than lore and leadarship is possible to play solo. With lower cost, but when you need to engage an enemy it´s even better. I like it.

Not great unless you know what is coming via scrying, but still, it delays a card so that you don't need to quest through it this round, and if it's a strong card, you can take a little time to get ready for it.

Still not entirely sure how well it'd work, though. May not be able to find a place in a deck.

## 765 [Mndela on September 18, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1804407)

It can be considered as a light Counsil Gildor. It makes the actual round easier, but the next round or in the future can be harder than normal. But you know what is coming and you get ready for it.

The maximum powerful can be the last rounds, it would be like a Counsil Gildor last round, but only with 2 cost.

It's unique, it's restricted, and it's only 1 attack per round. I don't think this should get any more nerfier. Note, that it scales only off allies, not characters, so heroes will not count.

Standard mathematical notation dictates that a constant coefficient should precede the variable, so it would be clearer if you reversed the order here, i.e., "3x".

I did a quick search for LOTR cards that can abuse him and I couldn´t find anything. He can be attached, but since his attacks can´t be prevented, the best attachment is poison stakes which is fine, only 2 dmg a turn.

 

Most events that can be played against him are the direct dmg ones or shadow discard, which are also fine.

 

He does not seem abusable. I wish that LOTR had a keyword like your Call of Cthulhu adaptation that would reduce the amount of wording he has (Enormous, Fatal Protection, Unstoppable, etc)

I think an ally like Ascended Champion, if real, would have weaker stats (like 1,1 and 1) and would probably cost 3. Super card, taught!

I like Hirluin effect, just think that he cost 12 threat, same as some powerhouse main heroes Aragorn, Beorn, Theoden, Thorin and Glorfidendel. He is not that poweful or important. I would prefer him much more if he was 10 costed and another dude/gal that is not Outland. Also, as written, his name is different then the old Hirluin and could be played together by the rules.

 

Ascendent Champion is really cool and unique. I like her. I would enjoy more if she had some kind of drawback Noldor related and costed 3, so being more viable and easier to play. She has Wandering Ent stats but you paid 1 resource to eliminate the enter exhausted drawback and 1 resource for her ability. She is cool and can find spot in some quests, but probable not good enough to be played in random quests, even if you plan to cheat her into play, you could do the same to unique powerful allies.

The Esper background and over the top clothing look a bit out of place, but mechanically she's pretty interesting. Now the Guardian of the Rim looks amazing, especially the art. I would go even further and make him a unique ally, just because that armor looks way too cool for a regular elf.

> That guardian guy is odd though.

I'm not sure why you think it's odd, but I'll explain my thoughts behind him.

 

He is an extremely stat efficient for his cost, even too stat efficient. And he also has a Sentinel keyword. So he must come with some sort of penalty, which is him taking damage for each card in your hand. He's also a Noldor, and the current Noldor theme is discarding cards from your hand. So, when you play Noldor themed deck, you'll have the best circumstances to play him as you'll be discarding a lot of cards.

I was in a rush and odd was the first word I could think of. Mostly, I was just thinking about him apart from the Noldor decks and I'm pretty sure if never play him there. I understand the idea of adding an extra "cost" other than resource costs, but how often do Tactics decks have 2 or fewer cards in hand? I guess it's more common now with Mablung being able to generate enough resources to start thinning your hand. I just feel the absolute need to only have 2 cards in hand in order for him to survive entering play is a bit harsh.

Could breathe some new life into Watcher of the Bruinen and Trollshaw Scout -- there's a good and thematic way for tactics to shed those extra cards to make way for something like this Guardian's mechanic.

joezim007, I guess it could be "reworked" into the: "Forced: After Guardian of the Rim enters play, if you have more than 3 cards in your hand, deal him 2 damage." or something like that.

That would be cooler and let you play that guy in some specifics decks that dont want to run Erestor, but can dump or use the hand fast.

Love it. He can be healed later to become awesome, but if he takes the two damage, he becomes worse than Defender of Rammas slightly until it's healed.

I'd probably play that in a deck with lots of healing or damage cancellation, but he doesn't really have to be.

## 809 [John Constantine on September 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1822724)

I had two guys in mind when I designed him: Defender of Rammas and Watcher of the Bruinen, because Guardian of the Rim is a direct competitor to them and he should not win that competition unless his condition is met (having few cards in your hand). If played from full hand, Guardian of the Rim technically has 3def/1hp, which puts him behind the Defender of Rammas, but unlike Defender of Rammas, he sports a Sentinel keyword (which is relevant only with 2+ players). When compared to Watcher of Bruinen, they have the same amount of defensive stats in combination, (3def+1hp vs 2def+2hp), and both are Sentinel, however Watcher has an action advantage. But, if Guardian of the Rim is played with his condition in mind, he should outclass them, but the condition is hard and usually harmful for the player to meet, so it's a bargain (unless you're running a Noldor synergy).

## 810 [joezim007 on September 28, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1823094)

Yup. I think it was well designed, especially after the first revision. The original was just too difficult to play without him just doing immediately outside of Noldor. Even in Noldor decks though, since he'd be played during planning, it could still be difficult to have a small enough hand for him to enter play with no damage on him.

A side note, that card let you attach mounts that can only be attached to heroes to allies. If that was unintended, you can put "eligible characters", look at Well-Equipped for a example of that.

That's some luxurious attire for a generic mercenary, worthy of Aegon Targaryen himself I'd say. The fleeting keyword is very cool though. He'd replace Feint in many decks I think.

## 817 [joezim007 on October 1, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1828304)

Judging by other cards that leave play at the end of the round (by discarding, rather than shuffling) I think the mercenary should probably be worth 2 resources, especially with built in readying.

Just the 1 willpower for a round is worth more than one resource in Tactics. =) 2 would still make him extremely affordable for his stats and ability. Otherwise, I love the card.

As for the Rohan Rider, I think his ability might be worth sticking on a stronger ally so that you're only paying 1 for an ally and the ability, though since mounts are generally affordable and the horse breeder can fetch mounts for only 1 resource, this may not be too bad.

This post gave me a good laugh :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I mean, I never knew it was someone royal, I just googled something like "human warrior art" and found it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

The difference with Feint is that Feint can be played outside of the planning phase and it can help another player (and prevent those pesky "additional attack" shadow effects).

Well, I didn't actually thought him through enough, I just had an idea and I quickly spat it out. However, I think that using his 1 willpower would be a huge waste of his action :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I'm not sure what you have tried to achieve with this wording, but if I understand it correctly, then you can't do this, because there is no way to mark a location as "permanently lost 1 quest point", so you'll need to mark that one as "until the end of the round". And I'm not sure why wouldn't you just use progress instead. Yes, there are quest that discard progress from locations, but they are very, very rare, to use this kind of treatment. Also, extremely similar to:

Yes, I forgot to add: ...until the end of the round.

 

Savant Forest, for example, played twice (for example, she was out by Tree People the first time), and if there is in play northern tracker and Greyflood Wanderer is coming..., sure all locations are explored.

 

Thinking if add one action: After Savant Forest leaves play, place one progress token on a location in game.
