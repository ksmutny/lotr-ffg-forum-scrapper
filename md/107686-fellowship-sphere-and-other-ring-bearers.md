I decided to play the Black riders box today for the first time and noticed something interesting. The use of language leads me to think that there will be other ring bearers. I know this is old new to most people and I've seen one or two posts in other threads about it but decided to make this anyway.

Who could be other ring bearers? I admittedly haven't ever read the books so I'm not sure who else could be a bearer (I know this is a crime and I plan to remedy this at the end of term).

Sam is the only one that comes to mind. Maybe Smeagol?

Again, I know it's old news for most people but I thought it was something interesting we could chat about. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Let me know what you think.

Anyone. Anyone who participated in the journey, doubtfully even Gollum.

It's hard to say how much the developers will let you stray from the original quest and ring-bearer. Will they open it up for any hero to gain the ring-bearer title or keep it restricted to Frodo and Sam?? I think at first is sounds cool if they scraped the Saga Hero Sphere after this next box and from now only only had a title attachment for a hero to be the ring-bearer, that would make for crazy scenarios and alternate world outcomes. But also that strays so far from the sources I don't know if I would really be comfortable with anyone but Frodo and Sam being the ring-bearer...

Um. We have a Grima hero. Stop clinging to the source.

Grima agrees with the source.. since it happened before he fully came out of the closet.

 

Maybe Grima could be the ring-bearer at some point... lol that seems so ridiculous   :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

You can play Grima in quests during the times when he actually revealed himself to be a traitor.

Yeah I know, hence the Doomed keyword and him partly screwing you over still.

There are a bunch of other rings. Elrond and Galadriel have them for example, so dose Saruman, etc etc. Pretty much anyone can carry rings, they all come at a price, but the one ring is the one that is the most full on. Anyone can carry it, but if you are a thematic player, I guess only frodo, Faramior, Gollum and Sam can hold it and only for a short time.

I was talking about the specific ring bearer trait, related to the saga LOTR boxes.

When does Faramir have the ring?

He never does, don't know where he got that from

Don't know about books, but in the movies, when Faramir caught Frodo, he had the guts to let him continue his jounrey without taking the ring from him. Maybe that's why.

## 12 [booored on June 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107686-fellowship-sphere-and-other-ring-bearers/?do=findComment&comment=1105752)

In the books as well, in fact it is a very important part of the story that was glossed over by the movies. Only 2 people resisted the ring. Faramir and Frodo, both becuase of love. Sam for Frodo and Faramir for his father. Aragorn, Gandalf, everyone else is consumed, but both of these guys gave it up freely. This is a massive plot point and has implications all the way though the idea of the "blood of men" being tainted. Not even Aragorn is immune... there is only 1 human that shows the men can be better than they are, again, as with Sam though Love and Loyalty.

Interesting. So he isn't a ring bearer in a typical sense, although he did bear and resist its corruption. I don't think he will be a ring bearer card though, the first thing you do to the bearer is give them the one ring.

After a little bit of thinking and all your responses, I'm thinking its just worded wonky and we will get a new frodo and nothing else. I'm hoping its an alternative Frodo though, not a replacement like the second Bilbo is. It would be good if he had a different ability that was just as useful so we could choose.

Hopefully Gollum. He had it at one point. Frodo, Bilbo, Gollum and Isildur are the only ones to ever hold it.

Sorry Golum could work.

Galadriel proved herself by relinquishing the ring offered by Frodo. And Aragorn let Frodo flee where Boromir couldn't at Parth Galen.

 

Not to mention Tom Bombadil, not even corrupted by the One Ring.

It's been a while since I read the books, but in the film at least, Sam takes the ring after Frodo is incapictated by Shelob and taken off by the Orcs.

There was already spoiled second version of Frodo. His stats remained the same, but he changed his ability (I don't remember it now, but it's somewhere in Road darkness' news)

I checked his ability-when he defends, exhaust One Ring, spend one ring resource and raise each player's threat by 2 so that this enemy cannot deal damage by this attack

Yeah, we know. And there is 4 more saga boxes to go. I will be very dissapointed if the only ring bearer through all these boxes will be Frodo.

N0t taking the ring it a big difference to picking it up and giving it back. They refused it from fear.

True booored. I was not trying to contradict you. Barely adding some references ...

 

The most amazing act of resistance to the One Ring power (except Bombadil) is for me the ability of Bilbo to let go the ring to Frodo almost freely.

When we know the power of It and the number of years Bilbo has been exposed to It. It is very impressive to see how Bilbo resisted and succeed in giving It up so fast with Gandalf help.
