I haven't played in a while but does this Response work like this? Something from the encounter deck removes your hero from the quest, and you get to re-commit him/her back to it. Is that it?

That would be the primary use, but it also combines with Elevenses or Don't Be Hasty to recommit to the quest while remaining ready.

The ability is useful only in a few quests, but +1 wp for 1 resource isn't bad on a dedicated quester, +2 wp if Elfhelm hero is out.
