Would my hope be shattered if I'll assume that it'll be out before the end of July?

these threads are ridicules. They will be out when they are out. Nothing will effect the time, all that can be done is for perpetual people to complain that they are not out fast enough or make up complete bullsheet trying to predict it. It is a type of topic that can go no where but down. What a complete waste of time.

Hopefully on Road Darkens.  An article that had a summary of the 3 quests in RD would be great.

Late July is probably a pretty safe bet for Three Trials (as safe as these things go, anyway). Since game companies love to have big releases for Gen Con, I'm also pretty certain that Road Darkens will show up there, and then be released to the public shortly thereafter.

We didn't get The Black Riders until GenCon (or shortly after for most of us).  If we continue getting one saga box a year that means we won't be pitching the Ring into Mt. Doom until the fall of 2018!

 

I guess the good news is that we have some years of LOTR gaming ahead of us.

At the Printer is a very far road from now to the release, I'm afraid.

I do remember, that's why I'm curious what it's status was on the upcoming page at that time to judge whether it's realistic that we would receive the long dark at this years gencon whilst currently "at the printers"

Do you mean the Road Darkens? It might be on the display with some cards shown (probably the ones already spoiled), but not on sale yet. Just an option.

the saga expansion wasn't available for a month or so after gencon for everyone else (same with the AP) - i'm sure they will have stock there.

This is what i meant; a release like BR was last year, with the realease for the masses following months after.

Sorry i wasn't more clear, i had no time to post really.

I would not be surprised we'll get another surprise release on a AP too there.

I cant remember the exact status, but i believe that blood of gondor was at the printers last year during Gen Con. Thats why it was such a surprise to go there and see it available for purchase! I think we were all exoecting to see Black Riders there...they may have even announced that in advance.

I would be surprised if we saw another article for the 3 trials (that wasn't just the release article). I would think we're long over due for a "the road darkens" preview however (not to derail the topic)

Wow 10 days away, after the wait for dunland trap this is awesome. Can't wait for full spoilers for three trials on the release date!!

A FFG created Dunlending or Southron "renegade" type hero who has renounced the cause of Sauron would be really great IMO. At least more interesting than these rather generic warrior girls we've been getting as of late.

I haven't really analyzed the numbering in each cycle, which pack do we expect Rumil to show up in? The spoiler looked like he's number fifty something.

Well, my hopes are based not on empty feelings. On some spoiled flavor text of the cycle, Dunlandling shaman guides our heroes. So I hoped he could show up as an ally or even a hero. Or someone from his tribe to aid us, or something.

> I haven't really analyzed the numbering in each cycle, which pack do we expect Rumil to show up in? The spoiler looked like he's number fifty something.

The hero in each set usually has the lowest player card number.  Gwaihir is listed as #59 in the spoiler for Trouble in Tharbad, so if Rumil is 5x than he should be in The Three Trials.  But since the encounter card numbers come after the player cards I don't think that Rumil can be numbered in the 50s.  And, of course, the card numbers have been wrong before. (Which is a long way of saying, "we don't know".)

From the spoiler article:

 

> Finally, The Three Trials introduces a new Spirit hero, as well as three copies of each player card. Fans of Middle-earth’s Elves will be pleased to find two new Elven allies, one Noldor and one Silvan, as well as events and attachments that promote the cycle’s new Silvan subthemes. You’ll also find a handful of cards that further support the game’s Secrecy keyword and decks that can keep their Threat at twenty or lower.



Only 1 Silvan ally :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

> As part of The Ring-maker cycle, The Three Trials doesn’t focus too heavily on any one player theme. While it lends greater strength to the Silvan mechanics that lead developer Caleb Grace outlined in his introduction to the cycle, the Adventure Pack also supports a wide range of player themes and mechanics that include the Noldor, Dúnedain, and Scout traits; increased interaction for multiplayer games; and the popular Secrecy mechanic that rewards players who can keep their Threat at or below twenty.



Not sure about Dunedain allies, but there will certainly be something for Dunedain. Also I really wonder what the card(s) for the Scout trait will do. We have several Scout allies, some of which aren't played often; giving a good attachment/event for them could bring them out of binders.

As for Rumil, I honestly can't read that number. I can guarantee it's not #50 because that number is given to Spirit of the Wild in the spoiler for The Tree Trials.:

 

> While your Noiseless Movement won’t help you sneak past the scenario’s Guardians, it might still help you sneak past other enemies, like the Spirit of the Wild (The Three Trials, 50)...



He could potentially come out this pack. We know he's not coming out in Trouble in Tharbad because we already have a Tactics ally spoiled there (though the trend could change to allow 2 allies in the same sphere in one pack). He could also come out in The Nin-in-Eilph or Celebrimbor's Secret, though it certainly looks like he has a 2-digit number, so it is likely either The Three Trials or The Nin-in-Eilph.

Ooooo one noldor ally as well!!! Forgot about that! Very exciting considering most of the older and more revered Elves (most of the powerful ones too!) are Noldor (Elrond, Gildor, Glorfindel, Elladan and Elrohir, Arwen, Erestor, Imladris Stargazer etc).

Ah nice the unique scout attachment is gonna be in this AP as well.

Nah it's cool, I'd rather start a thread with a whole handful of custom rules that are essentially just what I think the ruling should have been for cards/interactions I was wrong about, I'll make sure they're not well tested or even well worded too. Then I'll add a whole bunch of other random rules which pretty much change the entire game and the way it works. Oh also one of them breaks engagement and combat entirely as well as some rules that are directly in conflict with each other. All of which is technically cheating considering about half the rules will be different from what they actually are, but that's fine, I'll keep calling two handed play and those who use official rulings I disagree with cheaters. That'll be way more beneficial and less nasty for the community than just excitedly waiting for/guessing when the new set will come out!

The better rules do not contradict. Nothing breaks the mechanisms of the game. Yes they do change much of the game, but that is sorta the point. Basically all the new rules do is make it harder.

Given the hunger for news around these parts, it seems like they might be better off just doing quick bite size articles more frequently instead of longer ones every now and then. Maybe just pick one card to spoil and write a paragraph about it. It wouldn't be much, but it should be fairly quick to write up and would satisfy the hungry masses!

the unfortunate fact is LoTR is not doing very well at FFG. The dev team has been massively downsized, the printing priorities are lower and FFG is putting all the effort into the new LCG Conquest and of course Netrunenr which is selling like maddness. Conquest is getting a update every few days and the printing is in full swing for the GenCon release.

I expect after GenCon LoTR will be able to get through the pipe easier.

and where is any of this information coming from? LOTR not doing very well? where's the proof?

 

they are developing Nightmare straight to POD. They are developing new quests for Fellowship events. We still have a bunch of Sagas to go, in addition to standard cycles.

 

The dev team has been downsized? Says who?

 

There are different design teams for all of the LCGs, and they don't cross-over. So, just because Conquest is new, it's not necessarily pulling any work away from LOTR (or any other game for that matter). It's the new LCG, so of course it gets more announcements, just as LOTR did when it was new.

Buy looking at how it is marketed. All you need to do is go to the booth and see what games take up 5 bookcases and what games take up 1 shelf. Plus the check the print scheduled and see things get pushed back from one date to the next to allow others. Also lead and established designers are removed and new guys are promoted to lead designer to take over the show, stuff like that.

The game is not abandoned, not by a long shot. It will be going for a long time, but it is sorta a bit silly to expect a older and established IP to get the same attention as a brand new IP they are trying to launch when one of the biggest US gamecons is about to start. Look at CoC, that game has arguably a lower player count that LoTR but it is still going (though it has moved away from 6 pack cycles).

I expect after GenCon things will get back to normal.

FFG pushes back everything - they are notorious for this.

 

Additionally, the CEO himself said last year at GenCon that this is one of the top selling LCGs for them. Can't argue with the CEO. Out of all the products he had to cover in the InFlight report, LOTR was one that he did. If they game wasn't a priority, or popular, it never would have made it into the presentation.

 

Anecdotally, my FLGS says this is their #2 seller - right behind Netrunner, and far ahead of Star Wars.

Well, if that is true I find it pretty surprising.

I know in my store it has dropped to a mere trickle over the last year or so. (Though there has been a surge recently with the introduction of our custom rules on game days) As has the advertising packets that FFG send me. As for the dev thing, it is no secret.. just look at the designers. FFG like most companies like this have "star designers" and new commers and upcoming.. all the stars have been moved to other projects. FACT. That is to not say Caleb is not doing a fine job, in fact I think the latest sets are looking extremely good, but he got the job for a reason. Also as to the release thing.. no.. it is not the same for all games. Netrunner is release on the dot every time, as are many of the FFG products. If you do not believe this, just look at the release feed.

Still your right, this is a supposition from me. Still I find it hard to believe anyone who is impartial could possible think this game is just as popular now as it once was.

You'd all stop writing posts like this if you liked one of FFG's actually neglected brands.

My favorite FFG product of all is the Anima RPG which is published in Spanish by Edge entertainment and then published in English by FFG - typically a year or two later than the Spanish product. The re-written core rules (second edition) are still not available in English despite the fact that two of the expansion books that came out after them are (and they assume you're using second edition).

Year or Two. Delay. The books in Spain come out only once a year or less to begin with.

When they do come out they get One, maybe Two posts, total. (One to say it's coming and one to say it's gone :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])

Lord of the RIngs, getting 10+ products per year, plus multiple articles for each of those, is a lot more alive.

Exactly, just because it is dropping in popularity doesn't mean FFG is dumping it, long life is assured. It just means that the printing priority is different which is why other games come out the very second they say they will and other games can be weeks late.

I find that feeling less bad about something just because there is something even worse in the world is just silly.

 

The fact that your anima comes so rare and didn't got the release of something changes nothing about LotR LCG.

I find that crying about the release schedule of a vanity product is just silly.

I mean if you're taking that attitude that we shouldn't compare it to anything except it's own existence in a vacuum then why not just accept that FFG will get it out as soon as they can (which is the best business move).

If it can't be better complaining or even discussing it, won't make any difference. If it can be better FFG would be encouraged to make it better by sales (which this game has) not by threads like this.

Ha! Definitely not the first time I've been wrong. My guess is the really big news is coming tomorrow, and if not tomorrow then by the end of the week, and if still nothing then we'll have something by the end of the month, and if not by then, really big news should come before GenCon, and if not before then certainly after.

There now I've covered all my bases.

The Question is; what's the big news going to be? Let me consult my Palantir.

Hm, The road darkens and all I can see is a hero in the distance with a pointy hat, although it may be a trick of Sauron, we'll see.

On the day that dunland trap was released someone from FFG posted all the cards in the dunland trap spoilers on cardgamedb (which FFG apparently bought recently). I'm hoping this is a new trend with the ring maker cycle where they spoil the cards once they are released to the public so that those of us who live far away (well... really just anywhere but the US....) and have to wait several extra weeks at least get to see the contents when everyone else does if we so wish.

Super super impressed by this and will be mega let down if it doesnt continue.
