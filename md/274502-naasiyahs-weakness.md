Hi fellow players!

If I attack Na'asiyah [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Na%27asiyah-Enemy-TGH] with the Mirkwood Runner [http://www.ringsdb.com/card/02123], because she ain't immune to player card effects, I can kill her in two turns, right?

Thanks!

Yes. This is how I inadvertently beat Raid on the Grey Havens the first time I did it.

IÂ nuked her with Gandalf my first time winning that quest. But Mirkwood runner is an excellent solution as well.
