Suppose I have Elrond in play with Vilya attached to him.  If I use Vilya's ability to exhaust both of them and reveal a Stand and Fight, what is the maximum cost of the ally I can bring back into play?

 I think, because you didn't pay any resources to play Stand and Fight, the value to which X corresponds, the highest cost would be 0. Unfortunately. Would be good to hear other people's thoughts though.

i would agree- as in we have not been idle, if you dont pay any resources, then X is 0

rich

 This is off-topic, but I don't own this particular AP yet, and never noticed before… Vilya is neutral.  That seems like all but a guarantee that we'll be seeing more of Elrond in other spheres.  Think so?

Addendum - If I have a Warden of Healing in my discard pile, and I flip Stand and Fight with Elrond+Vilya, can I pay 2 resources to bring him back, since the resource payment of Stand and Fight is technically optional?

No, don't think so. Vilya allows you to either play the card for no cost, hence X equals 0, or put it at the bottom of the deck. So you can't optionally add two resources to pay for the Warden, since Vilya either plays the card at 0 cost or not at all.  It's not a normal play of a card, so it limits what you can do. Of course, I may well be off here: other people's thoughts?
