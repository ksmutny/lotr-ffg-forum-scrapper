In purchasing your second core set, you were in possession of 4 copies of 38 different cards (2 per core set).  Would you be interested in selling your fourth copy of each of those 38 cards?  I was thinking along the lines of $7.50 for the cards, plus $2.50 s&h.  If you are interested, please PM me and we can work something out.

I do not know of a "marketplace" in these forums, so if this thread was placed improperly, I apologize.  Also, this is not meant to be a thread to discuss the merits of keeping versus selling the extra copies of cards one might have.  If you intend to keep all the cards in your possession, I respect your decision and this thread was not directed toward you.

Yours,

Pericles

I would take you up on this, but I'm new to these forums and can't see how to PM you. Do I have to add you to my list of Friends first?

Go to your "My messages" in the upper right-hand corner of your screen and click the envelope.  It will take you to your mailbox and in the left hand margin you should see "write a new message."  Click that and you then should see "compose message" screen.  In the "to" box type "Pericles" and you should start to see a dialog box pop up with members who start with "P" and select "Pericles" then type your message and hit "send."  Hope that helps.

No problem.  I am a newb myself.
