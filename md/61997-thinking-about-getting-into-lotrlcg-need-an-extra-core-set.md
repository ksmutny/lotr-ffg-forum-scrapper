 This is just an FYI for anyone thinking about getting into this game, anyone who has a friend wanting to get started, or anyone looking to bolster his/her collection with more cards.

I just put my collection up for auction on ebay: the Core Set and all 6 Adventure Packs from the Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle.  Someone is probably going to walk away with this for a song because I have set the starting bid price to $.99 and there is no reserve.

I have loved this game.  But taking care of a family while attending grad school full-time has left me no time to play.
