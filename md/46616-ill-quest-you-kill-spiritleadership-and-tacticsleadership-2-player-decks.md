 After getting in our final 2 core sets, the missus and I put together some decks for us doing some cooperative questing. Play tested them last night and we finished JdtA with a final score of 54, and had virtually no trouble dealing with 2 Hill Trolls.

Spirit/Leadership (aka, Aragorn is a beast) - 51 cards

Heroes: Aragorn, Eowyn, Eleanor

3x Unexpected Courage
3x Celebrian's Stone
3x Steward of Gondor
3x A Test of Will
3x The Galadhrim's Greeting
3x Lorien Guide
3x Ever Vigilant
3x Dwarven Tomb
3x Hasty Stroke
3x Snowbourn Scout
3x A Light in the Dark
3x Gandalf
3x Strength of Will
3x Sneak Attack
3x Common Cause
3x Will of the West
3x Northern Tracker

Tactics/Leadership (aka, Legolas's got this) - 51 cards

Heroes: Legolas, Gimli, Theodred

3x Guard of the Citadel
3x Longbeard Orc  Slayer
3x Silverlode Archer
3x Horseback Archer
3x Quick Strike
3x Dwarven Axe
3x Citadel Plate
3x Horn of Gondor
3x Blade of Gondolin
3x Gondorian Spearman
3x Swift Strike
3x Sneak Attack
3x Feint
3x Valiant Sacrifice
3x Steward of Gondor
3x Beorn
3x Gandalf

Basically, the point of the S/L deck is pure questing with splashes of threat and enemy control. The T/L is just raw brutality. Some of these cards are sort of... filler for now (Sneak Attack in S/L, Guard of the Citadel in T/L, etc.). I welcome any feedback, but please keep in mind that these decks are meant to be played together and never separately happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I got the same Idea, but I never realised 2 decks that are meant to be played together without any lore-cards for the healing power ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Only one of the two players is able to play Steward of Gondor, it's a unique card. Did you consider this?

 I've seen no need to play Lore in either deck yet, honestly. There's a lot of wound mitigation in the Spirit/Leadership deck if you look at the card list ;-)

And yes, we've considered replacing the Steward of Gondor in the Tactics/Leadership deck, but we're not sure what we'd replace it with actually. Maybe some Snowborn Scouts? Also, I've been thinking of replacing Sneak Attack in the Spirit/Leadership deck with whatever card readies all characters in play, I forget what it's called but it costs 5 Leadership. The SoG makes it trivial to get that many resources, actually.
