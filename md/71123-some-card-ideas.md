## 1 [GrandSpleen on September 16, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71123-some-card-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=694634)

Hi all,

Here are some ideas I had for cards recently.  What do you think?  Add your own ideas or feedback!

Peregrin Took (unique)
Sphere: Spirit
Card type: Ally
Cost: 3
WP: 2
Atk: 1
Def: 0
HP: 2
Hobbit.
Quest Action: Exhaust Peregrin Took to look at the top card of the encounter deck. If that card is a Treachery card, immediately reveal and resolve it. Otherwise, you may move that card to the bottom of the deck.

Rationale: Gandalf repeatedly admonishes Pippin for his Tookish curiosity, which gets the fellowship into trouble more than once.  His action here is meant to capture that, as well as the strange fortune which can accompanies that curiosity.


Follow-up
Sphere: Tactics
Card type: Attachment
Cost: 2
Skill.
Response: After an enemy survives an attack in which the attached hero participates, deal one damage to that enemy.

This could also be a one-time use event, instead of an attachment.  Originally I had the text "an enemy with which you are engaged" in there, but I removed it to make the card more robust.


Erkenbrand (unique)
Sphere: Leadership
Card type: Hero
Threat: 9
WP: 1
Atk: 2
Def: 2
HP: 4
If Erkenbrand is ready at the end of the combat phase, search your deck for one Rohan ally and add it to your hand. Shuffle your deck.
Response: After a Rohan character leaves play, choose 1: return that character to your hand, or ready Erkenbrand.

Rationale: Erkenbrand leads the men defending the Westfold during the events of The Two Towers.  After the defenses at the Fords of Isen were broken, Erkenbrand and Gandalf had to gather Erkenbrand's scattered forces while riding to Helm's Deep.  Although it probably Gandalf who did the lion's share of gathering (thanks to the speed of Shadowfax), that is the thematic role that I've tried to capture with his ability here.  If anything, his ability is too robust.  But it does fit very well in the "leadership" flavor.  Only problem is that his ability will interact with way more Spirit allies than Leadership ones!  Should this be a Spirit hero?  Also, I am not really happy with his stats… just didn't want to overpower him.

 

That's all… just a couple of things I wanted to share! Thanks for reading.

There are some great ideas there.

As it stands I'm not sure I'd ever use Peregrin without prior knowledge of what was on top of the encounter deck.

How about: Quest Action: Exhaust Peregrin Took before staging to look at the top card of the encounter deck. You may move that card to the bottom of the encounter deck. Until the end of the phase, treachery cards gain surge.

Erkenbrand is VERY strong. Even if you removed the static part of his text, the response part is still really strong. The ability to block with a snowborn scout every turn is too good, its a feint and an Asfaloth all in one!

Something like this still fits the theme but feels more balanced.

Response: If a Rohan ally leaves play, chose 1: put that ally on top of your deck or ready Erkenbrand.

Theodan (unique)
Sphere: Leadership
Card type: Hero
Threat: 10
WP: 2
Atk: 2
Def: 2
HP: 5

rohan. noble.

Response:  After questing succesfully all rohan characters gain +1 atk until the end of the turn

Since most of the Rohan characters are focused around willpower and passing thru quests; I thought it would be cool for Theodan to inspire and motivate his warriors after making progress

Denethor (unique)
Sphere: Leadership
Card type: Hero
Threat: 8
WP: 1
Atk: 1
Def: 3
HP: 3

gondor. noble. steward.

 

At the beginning of the turn, if you control at least 5 noble characters, shuffle the bottom two cards of your discard pile back into your deck.

Wanted to have a character that finally takes advantage of the noble trait; kind of makes sense too that Nobles would want to "sustain" their blood line and there arent too many card effects that suffle cards back in

 

Galadriel (unique)
Sphere: Spirit
Card type: Hero
Threat: 13
WP: 4
Atk: 1
Def: 1
HP: 4

Silvan. Noble.

Action: Discard a card from your hand to chose one of the following: Decrease any players threat by 2. Increase the atk of a silvan character by 2. (limit once per turn)

A pretty powerful card for a pretty powerful character in the LOTR universe.  Silvan is also another trait that has been neglected so far i wanted to take advantage of; i also wanted to keep with the "spirit" theme of decreasing threat.  Tried to offset the powerful effect by tying it to the players hand which is normally pretty crucial.  The high starting threat is part of the attempted balance

 also realized i want to make a new Legolas and Gimili (only fair since Aragorn got a 2nd version)

Gimli (unique)
Sphere: Spirit
Card type: Hero
Threat: 11
WP: 2
Atk: 2
Def: 2
HP: 5

Dwarf. Noble. WarriorS

When an attachment is placed on Gimli, place 2 progress tokens on the current quest.  If that attachment is a "weapon" card, you may play 2 progress tokens on a location of your choice

flavor text: "We dwarves are natural sprinters!  Very dangerous over short distances!"

Gimli and his axe are basically inseparable so this ability gives him the chance to make good on his quote when given a weapon attachment, (preferrably an axe).  The quest progress fits with his new sphere of spirit as well.  Probably needs mixed in with a tactics deck however since there are almost no advantageous spirit attachments for him

 

speaking of which maybe i'll make him one (this is all imaginary anyway)

Relic of Mazarbul (unique)
Sphere: Spirit
Card type: Attachment

Item. Weapon.

Attach to a dwarf character. Attached character gains +1 attack.

If attached character is Gimli or Balin, this card gains "restricted" and attached character gains +2 attack instead and lower your threat by 1 when partcipating in an attack that destroys an Orc or Goblin enemy.  

Legolas (unique)
Sphere: Lore
Card type: Hero
Threat: 9
WP: 1
Atk: 3
Def: 1
HP: 4

Noble. Silvan. Warrior

Ranged

After Legolas participates in attack and destroys that enemy, the player whom was engaged with the destroyed enemy draws 2 cards

Nothing terribly innovative, just a lore themed alternative to his tactics counter-part
