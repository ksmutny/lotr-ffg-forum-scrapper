Firstly i'm sorry of asking this in here and not in the questions section, but we need answers for this as soon as possible.

 

So we are playing The Three Trials and we choosed the second stage as the trial of perseveranse and after we read the both sides of the quest card, we didn't understand that how we could get that key from the guardian if it couldn't take damage (except from the quest card effects but there isn't anything in the quest card that would deal damage to the quardian).

So how we can win now if we can't kill the guardian and we cannot get the key from it to activate that bottom text of the quest card?

You attach the key to the randomly selected Barrow location, not the Guardian.

I meant that posting this here would make people notice this faster and then i could get answer faster than normally, since this was very important thing and we needed answer as fast as possible.
