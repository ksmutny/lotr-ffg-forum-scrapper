Hi all,

 

I haved two questions on the scour effect in Celebrimbor's Secret

 

1) Collapsed Tower: If the location is in the staging area (i.e. it is not the active location), do I still place two damage on it?

 

2) Bellach: If I choose to resolve Bellach as the last scour effect, do I resolve any scour effects on the orc enemies that I add to the staging area, or is the "scouring phase" considered completed once I have resolved Bellach's scour and the new orc enemies' scouring effect does not trigger?

 

Many thanks in advance for your help!

 

Regards,

 

Agesilaos

1) Yes, it'll still receive damage.  If a card says "do X, then do Y" you only have to do Y if you were able to do X.  But this card says "do X and do Y" so you have to resolve both parts regardless of whether X did anything.

 

2) Because the Orcs were not in play when the Quest card's Forced effect triggered, you will not have to trigger the Scour text on orcs that were put into play via Bellach's Scour effect.

Hi, GrandSpleen,
