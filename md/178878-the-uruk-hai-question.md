Just to make sure I did this right:

 

 

ffg_MEC45_30.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_MEC45_30.jpg]  vs  ffg_escort-from-edoras-ajtr.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_escort-from-edoras-ajtr.jpg]

 

I don't have to discard my Escort after choosing the first option as the quest has not been resolved, right?

 

(btw. I love the thematic use of this treachery)
