Not sure if this is a wonderful or terrible omen regarding the fate of the game past the current cycle.

For the record, Hachette has done this with other games:

So how much of this product is Hachette, and how much is FFG, is as yet unclear. (FFG/Asmodee is appropriately credited inside, though.)

Looks weird to me, but might be a cheap way to hook more people to the game. If so, then I do sure hope that more reprints of older content are on their way for those players. Would be a different approach to the campaign, so my interest is peaked at least. Hopefully it will make its way across the North Sea to us.

I just started a new thread for this, before seeing this one. (Sorry.)
