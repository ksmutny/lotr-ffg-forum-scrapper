Man, it's fun to go back and read the preview articles before the game came out. That was a painful wait from Aug '10 to April '11! You kids these days don't even know... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Narsil, I had no idea how far you went back with this game. It was fun to read all your comments on each article.

I got into the game after mirkwood was finished, but before khazadum came out. I remember a lot of those articles, but not the very early ones.

Yeah! this was reason I signed up with the forums! I forgot the comments used to be directly on the article page.

I was playing Arkham Horror but this is the first and only game I've ever been seriously devoted to. It is my perfect game.

It's been a great ride seeing the game progress and having you guys to geek out with.

It is interesting to remember just how many articles they used to do for AP's, especially during the Dwarrowdelf cycle, compared to now. Of course, the current designers have a lot more to manage than the designers did back then, between the regular cycles, saga expansions, new Fellowship quests, and Nightmare. Still, it'd be nice to see more articles like they used to do back in the day, about strategy, deck building...

 

Wait a minute, why am I trying to put myself out of business. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  Forget I said anything....

I think it's healthy for the strategy and deck building to have moved from the designers to dedicated fans.  Occasionally it might be nice to see an article about this stuff from the designers, but mainly I think it's better if they let the fans take on this role. (As it creates a community in which the fans are more involved with each other).

What I would like to see is FFG occasionally linking to fan articles to help build the community more. (They already do support the fan sites in other ways, but a direct, hey check this out, might be nice in the news feed sometimes).

When was the last time we saw a Second Breakfast article?

Ooh....yes, I still remember the Dark Age. When I was sitting in my empty cave gnawing on bones and eagerly waiting for the game to release! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Funny thing is, that I also started playing Arkham Horror and then checked out the ffg site to find out they just anounced a lotr card game. Upon which I registered here at the forums and been following the game closely ever since. Although not always that active in the forums ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Thanks for the awesome overview, it's really a lot of fun to browse through these articles! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
