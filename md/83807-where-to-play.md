I travel for work and would like to find places to play when I travel. Is there a tool that helps players do this?

Not unless you count playing online as a "place". OCTGN will allow you to play on your computer.

I can play easily at the FFG center here in Roseville, MN. I was just hoping there was a way for me to play elsewhere while on the road.
