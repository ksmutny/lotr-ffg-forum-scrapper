there is a location that says underworld 1…so when it enters play you put 1 card underneath it

it also has when revelead place 1 card underneath the active location if able

which comes first? i played it as 'when revelead' was first, as enters play means hits the table right?

thanks

Sounds correct to me.  Same would be true for a treachery card with surge.  You don't surge until after you resolve the when revealed effect.

I played the Anduin scenario recently, and I had to reveal a lot of encounter cards because of Surge - is that how you do it? The first card said "Surge", so I revealed a second, which also said "surge", so I revealed a third, a fourth and a fifth. Is that how you do it, or does it only apply once? Definitely made the first few rounds tough.

no you did it correctly- it always applies. in my case though there is a key word and a when revealed that both make you take cards from the encounter deck (or in this case something similar to an encounter deck)

i was confused as to whether the keyword, which is triggered when a card 'enters play' comes before or after a 'when revealed' keyword

i think that when revealed is first, as enters play surely means hits the table?

Phew, that's the way I've been playing. Thanks for looking into it.

Any way to change the title of the thread with the new software? It will be easier for others to search for in the future. I'm already liking the edit button.
