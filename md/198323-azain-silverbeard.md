Wow. That's a serious dwarf.

Hmm... Might be time to go back to a dwarf deck...

Well ... he seems a bit overpowered :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Saw it Christmas Eve, but still never mentioned it. Sorry hehe. Anyway, I really like the card. Giving new options to Tactics Dwarves with sucha good ally. Works excellently against bosses like the Trolls (Carrock or Hobbit) and those quests where you can get swamed by Nazgul or Barrow wights. Dealing 2 damage to such enemies is very welcome, with Dwarves or not. Also, that other Last Stand event, by the slightly visible curve in the cost, I'll hazard will cost 0, and the effect will be like "After a (Rohan) character is destroyed while defending that attack, deal damage to the enemy equal to the characters" hit points? attack? defense? Anyway, it depicts Hama as the flavor text suggests, and it's looking awesome.

It's silly, but my first thought was to attach Sword-thain to him so that I can add a copy of Mighty Prowess. Overkill, but fun nonetheless.

## 10 [PsychoRocka on January 9, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198323-azain-silverbeard/?do=findComment&comment=1980071)

My guess for the event is:

"After a Rohan ally/ally/character/rohan character is destroyed while defending an attack, deal damage to the attacking enemy equal to that characters attack value"

Using Mighty Prowess on Tactics Aragorn with this guy will be good.

Just add a Rohan warhorse here and there and you're set to clean ship.

Wow. That's one powerful sumbitch!

 

Did you notice how exceedingly more powerful cards from newer cycle become? Designers are trying to keep up with the ever growing difficulty. And you bash me for creating overpowered cards :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I see what you did there...

Clean ship... Good one.

It seems to me, by looking at the place where usually is the symbol of the Expansion/Cycle that this Dwarf is the tactics ally in the first adventure pack (the Flight of the StormCaller, if not mistaken) of the Dream Chaser cycle...

 

 

It seems to be card number 4 (?) of that cycle which seems to be represented by a Tree...

 

Also the quest card behind is from that AP.

I don't get why you guys are saying this is so crazy/overpowered when the Erebor Battle-Master still exists.

Even outside of that consideration, he's good, sure, but you have to spend a resource every time you want the damage, whereas Mighty Prowess admittedly is only half the damage, but it only costs the 1 resource to play it in the first place and thereafter the effect is free.

Not to say he's not good, I like him, but hardly overpowered, especially on a unique ally.

Because Erebor Battle-Master has no attack if you play him outside of Dwarf deck?

 

Azain Silverbeard is second ally know in the game that costs 3 and has 3 printed unconditional attack, first one being the Knight of Minas Tirith.

 

Would Azain Silverbeard's printed text box be blank, he would still be a tremendousely good card and an must have at least 1 copy in most Tactics decks.

Yes! More direct damage. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Three attack is very good when attacking a goblin swordsman, and two direct damage destroys both swordsmen and spearmen. Two def and two hit points is good enough when defending a normal goblin. Seems very good for seventh level.

I don't think Azain is overpowered, he's just a great card.  This guy has a more "aggro" style than the Battle Master, who has a higher potential attack but takes longer to get there.  Recall that, after the errata, the Battle Master gets +1 attack for each other dwarf ally you control.  That means he starts with only 1 attack if you play him first, and you have to get 2 more allies on the table before he's the even the equal stat-wise of Azain.  You're looking at round 3 or 4 before he even matches Azain for attack power.

cool! I saw him before, but forgot a bit about him.
4 att for 3 cost and that ability. Nice dwarf!

I think overpowered depends on the quest. This guy could be killer in the KD/DD quests. But for the later quests, or the AtS scenarios with a wider range of enemy traits, not so much. This is what makes this a Living card game. The power curve of the player cards and encounter cards grow together. So that we need more powerful cards for the new stuff, but these become ridiculous when used back for earlier quests.

That is why FFG could give an offical word about "Progression style" instead of the rotation that someone suggested also for LOTR LCG. It is not so critical in a cooperative game where the community and the players self-regulate themselves, but still it would be a nice touch.

I believe the Tactics event deals damage equal to the defeated allies cost, actually. And I hope it is not only for Rohirrim.
