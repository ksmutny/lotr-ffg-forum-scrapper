Introducing the Hero Championship 2016 edition!

 

http://challonge.com/lotrhero2016 [http://challonge.com/lotrhero2016]

 

 

This year's tournament includes heroes added from the following expansions:

- The Flame of the West

- The Grey Havens

- The Sands of Harad

- The Dream-chaser Cycle

 

Seeding is based on last year's results with the new heroes being added throughout the list based on their release. The oldest new heroes received the highest seeding. No new hero was added to the top of bottom 10.

 

The major change here is that we will now all be voting directly through Challonge. In order to vote, you must register to vote on the Challonge site. I think this is a good change, but it does potentially take away one of the features that I like best: reading the friendly banter and conversation on these forums. We'll see if that still happens, I'd love it if it did.

 

Visit http://challonge.com/lotrhero2016 [http://challonge.com/lotrhero2016] for the bracket layout and voting.

 

Each round is four days with voting closing at noon CST.

 

Ending Dates are as follows:

Round 1: Wednesday Dec 7

Round 2: Sunday Dec 11

Round 3: Thursday Dec 15

Round 4: Monday Dec 19

Round 5: Friday Dec 23   <---

Semi-Finals: Tuesday Dec 27

Finals: Saturday Dec 31 (voting closes at 11:59pm)

 

 

Shortly after, I'll post the results of each round on this thread.

Thanks for organizing Thanatopsis!  Looking forward to it!

 

Here are my thoughts on a few match ups, mostly the newer heroes.

 

Boromir (Le) vs Legolas (S) - I know the new Legolas is shiny and can be fun to pair with Gimli, but I just don't see how you would ever choose him over Tactics Legolas or Lanwyn.  Meanwhile, Boromir does serious work in one of my favorite decks, the Gondor-Erestor swarm.

 

Na'asiyah vs Dori - Is Na'asiyah any good?  Her ability seems too expensive.  I'm going to take this opportunity to actually vote for Dori.

 

Prince Imrahil (T) vs Theoden (T) - These two actually pair really nicely together with Eowyn.  I think the new Imrahil is a boss and has potential for top 4.

 

Merry (T) vs Elfhelm - I do really like Elfhelm, but Merry is so solid in a Hobbit deck.

 

Boromir (T) vs Bifur - I'm not even joking.  Bifur is such a solid splash lore hero.  Meanwhile, Boromir and his tricks are boring.

 

Merry (S) vs Beregond (S) - This is a tough one.  I think it comes down to the fact that spirit Merry is probably the better version of Merry.  Meanwhile, spirit Beregond is definitely the worse version of Beregond.

 

Aragorn (Le) vs Amarthiul - Elfhelm and Armored Destrier made Marty a lot better.

 

Pippin (Lo) vs Treebeard - Treebeard can do some tricks, but you really have to build a deck around him.  Meanwhile, Pippin is quite versatile.

Elrond got absolutely robbed by Galadriel in 2014. I still think he deserves the title but with more and more heroes each year he stands less of a chance. I have to say as much as it is way more easy and sensible for us to vote through challonge I prefer voting on the forums because as you say it promotes banter and discussion. At least you will still be announcing the results of each round when it finishes on here.

Gimli (Le) vs Gandalf second round will be a killer to my new favourite hero :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

## 14 [GrandSpleen on December 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2526468)

Na'asiyah vs Dori: Actually have found a use for Dori in a couple of decks.  Used him to good effect in Shadow and Flame.  Na'asiyah I haven't been able to find an effective use yet.  Just expensive and the effect is not worth devoting resource acceleration to, when those resources could be going somewhere else.

 

Prince Imrahil (T) vs Theoden (T): I like Theoden quite a bit.  I am sure he will go out very early, probably this round.  But one of my favorites recently.

 

Merry (T) vs Elfhelm: Love the mount decks!

 

Denethor (Le) vs Halbarad: Denethor is scarily good and really makes a couple of my decks work (which previously struggled for early game resources)

 

Faramir (Lo) vs Mirlonde: The green Faramir is another tricky hero that I like to attempt to build decks around.  Although usually they don't work out so well!  But he keeps me trying and interested...

 

Thalin vs Fatty Bolger: Fatty will get decimated here, but he is another one of those heroes that is kind of fun to try a deck with.  He can work well but he'll never be a power player.

 

Galdor of the Havens vs Dain: I think I like Galdor more than is reasonable.

 

Gimli (T) vs Prince Imrahil (Le): Gimli is still a boss.  But he has such an achilles' heel.  Text box blanking destroys him.  We badly need an attachment that makes an attached hero immune to text box blanking.

 

Damrod vs Eowyn (T): I predict this will be one of the closest matchups in this round. Going with Damrod for supporting a fun and unique archetype all by himself.  Eowyn really unlocks solo Tactics decks, but that's not really my thing.

Damrod v Eowyn (T) was the hardest matchup this go-around. I eventually decided on Damrod since I just love trap decks, but it was tough to vote against Eowyn (T) since she has been great fun this year!

## 16 [CommanderDave on December 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2526616)

The Denethor-Arwen and Galadriel-Mablung vote in round three will be a tough choice. I can't believe Rossiel is giving Glorfindel a run for his money. He's still awesome and she is most certainly not.

Arwen came in 10th last year.

 

Here's our top 10 seeding by the way. I can't really argue too much with the overall results from last year; they are all top-notch heroes. However, I suspect that that everyone's thoughts on Theoden (S) have cooled a bit.

 

1 Sam Gamgee

2 Gandalf

3 Beregond (T)

4 Theoden (S)

5 Elrond

6 Aragorn (T)

7 Legolas (T)

8 Frodo Baggins

9 Éowyn (S)

10 Arwen Undomiel

A lot of people voted for Theoden because they thought he looked like Santa Claus if I remember correctly.

Jej, here we go again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Some toughts about some matchups:

 

Merry (T) > Elfhelm - I prefer Merry as he is great in Hobbit decks and enables fun Combos. Elfhelm is good, but really only in multiplayer and People migh not run (enough) Mounts.

 

Na'asiyah > Dori - Didn't Play to much with her, but I enjoy herocentric decks and Na'asiyah with Steward, 2 Swords of Numenor and ranged can do work with soe readying (similiar to treebeard). Also emergency Defender and low threat for tactics!

 

Eleanor > Erestor - Just recently started to Play 3 Player (Progression style) and god did this queen save our bacon every now and then.

 

Damrod > Eowyn (T) - Hard choice, but Traps jsut don't work without Damrod :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Boromir (Le) > Legolas (S) - I love my Gondor allies deck.

 

Brand > Elladan - Ofc Brand sucks solo, but with heroes that profit strongly from readying he is so good. A friend and I use him in our NM campaign and we will miss him when he will be lost in Moria (other heroes are not negotiable)

 

Galdor > Dain - Dwarfs are boring!

 

Glorfindel > Rossiel - Beloved Spiritfindel is such a great stable in my decks he beats Rossiel, who really offers only one decks to Play.

 

Beregond (S) > Merry (S) - Holy crap was that a though decision (and after my vote challonge Shows a 50-50 :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]). In the end new Beregond ist unqiue as a great Spirit Defender and takes the place.

> Elrond got absolutely robbed by Galadriel in 2014.

Still have to disagree with this. Galadriel is amazing.

 

> Damrod vs Eowyn (T): I predict this will be one of the closest matchups in this round.

Without actually checking how the votes are looking so far, I suspect you'll be wrong. I'm pretty confident TEowyn will win by a decent margin.

 

> I can't believe Rossiel is giving Glorfindel a run for his money. He's still awesome and she is most certainly not.

Glorfindel is boring and overly ubiquitous. Rossiel is not.

 

> In the end new Beregond is unqiue as a great Spirit Defender

*Cough*Frodo*cough*

I mean, I'm also voting for Beregond in tht matchup, but just pointing out that we have had a great Spirit defender since the second AP.

 

Other thoughts:

 

Hama vs Dunhere: I never used to use Hama because I was put off by the ability to cheese everything with endless Feints, but lately I've been enjoying him a lot.

Prince Imrahil (T) vs Theoden (T): This is admittedly partly because I haven't played with Timrahil yet, but Tactics Theoden is a much under-rated hero who has been getting a lot better in recent times

Thorin Oakenshield vs Oin: I just wanted to vote for the underdog.

Faramir (Le) vs Elrohir: I was thinking going down the list that Elrohir deserves a decent run, but he's up against one of my favourites.

Grima vs Argalad: Grima also deserves a decent run, but I really like Argalad.

Nori vs Dwalin: Partly again a case of voting for the underdog, but I have found that sometimes Dwalin is actually still pretty great, so there are valid reasons here.

Elladan vs Brand Son of Bain: I love Brand to a possibly unreasonable extent.

Caldara vs Bilbo Baggins: The only possible knock I can level at Caldara at this point is that she may have become too good with recent releases.

Beorn vs Idraen: This is slightly painful because Idraen is another of my favoured underdog heroes, but Beorn is one of the most pure fun heroes in the game.

 

The most difficult choices for me, haven't actually voted yet as of this post:

 

Boromir (Le) vs Legolas (Sp): I haven't actually played with new Legolas yet, but I really want to like him.

Lanwyn vs Erkenbrand: Both really interesting and good in the right situation, and so different I struggle to compare them. Neither are really my top favourites, rather they're both kind of middling and don't stand out.

Pippin (Lo) vs Treebeard: Pippin is absolutely the better pick for his versatile utility, but Treebeard is just so much fun.

Mablung vs Beravor: These two are both top picks. resource generation versus card draw. How do I choose?

Boring but good vs interesting but bad. I put Rossiel in the same category as Lore Faramir - their own stats (notably their high threat) actively work against their own ability. I think they both could've been more solid heroes if they were more streamlined. Luckily, the fun part about Rossiel (the victory display mechanic) does not require her at all.

## 23 [GrandSpleen on December 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2527825)

Can you explain how Rossiel's threat works against her ability?  She does have 8 threat (lowest available excepting Hobbits and Bifur).  I can see her HP working against trying to use her defensively, but she has great stats for a quester.

8 threat is considered high now?

I realise this is contextual, 8 is higher than ideal if you're looking for Secrecy to play Out of the Wild cheaply, but out of context, 8 is not high.

As it happens, I think I would also put Rossiel together with Lore Faramir - pure power-wise they're both low tier heroes but they're fun, and when people complain that they don't work I feel like those people probably haven't tried hard enough (or maybe are using them in the wrong context, e.g. not everything works in solo).

## 25 [Rajam on December 6, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2527912)

Toughest matchups for me so far:

 

Boromir (T) vs Bifur

Bifur is amazing for secrecy decks, but I'll have to go with Boromir. Despite being boring, he is too good to ignore.

 

Celeborn vs Denethor (Lo)

I've always wanted to build a silvan deck, but Lore Denethor is a boss in solo. Scrying is super underrated and LoDenethor is the best option in that department.

> Can you explain how Rossiel's threat works against her ability?  She does have 8 threat (lowest available excepting Hobbits and Bifur).  I can see her HP working against trying to use her defensively, but she has great stats for a quester.

 

I'll elaborate a bit. 8 threat is relatively low, but if you want to start in secrecy for Out Of the Wild then it only leaves you 12 threat to work with, which does not leave you with many options. Even fewer if you want to stay in secrecy for a round or two. I realize Rossiel does not require OotW, but the other ways to get stuff in the victory display require you to explore/combat, which Rossiel isn't good at until after you've done it. To me this is a bit of a Catch 22.

 

Additionally, the bonuses you end up getting are pretty mediocre in my opinion. It takes a decent amount of effort to get a conditional +2 def/+2 WP. I can think of many other ways of getting the same buff, unconditionally, with the same or less effort. If Rossiel's ability had instead been something much more unique, like "When Rossiel is questing, and the active location shares a trait with a location in the victory display, ignore surge", I think I'd be more inclined to actually play her.

I think they both could've been more solid heroes if they were more streamlined. Luckily, the fun part about Rossiel (the victory display mechanic) does not require her at all.

I did challenge myself to make a functional solo deck with Rossiel, and was happy with the deck's strength (completed Fate of Numenor and Nightmare Flight to the Ford). It didn't make me like Rossiel though, because the whole time I felt like it would be more powerful if I traded Rossiel out for someone else, like Lore Denethor.

Fair enough!  I like her plenty myself, it's fun to have a versatile hero with 4 willpower and 4 defense for such a low threat cost. I never play solo though.  And I wouldn't consider running her in a secrecy deck. She shines most in 3-4 player games.  If you happen to be playing her at the same table as somebody else doing victory display shenanigans, you're golden.  If you get everyone running Keen as Lances, you give every deck at the table a way to shore up its own weaknesses as needed.

Completely agree that she is amazing. I have totally changed my mind about her since her release and I am currently running her in my two decks. She brings amazing flexibility and abilities with her but honestly just does not compare to Elrond at all. I think lots of players vastly underestimate just how powerful and useful he is. He makes both a fantastic quester and defender and is no slouch at attacking either. He boosts ALL HEALING across the board regardless of who or what actually performs the healing, he can pay for allies of ANY sphere which is something I feel everyone doesn't give anywhere near enough credit then on top of all of that you have the insane Stargazer + Vilya combo with him as well.

Unlike Galadriel he can quest off the bat without any attachments or his ring.

There aren't even that many heroes that have one great ability let alone two and he has two awesome abilities, great stats and works extremely well/directly comboes with a ridiculous number of allies and attachments.

CHRISTMAS Matchups!

 

GREEN vs RED!

 

Spotlight on BERAVOR and MABLUNG!  It's a matchup of Rangers!  Dunedain versus Gondor.  Currently sitting at 57% for Mablung and 43% for Beravor.

 

 

Mablung.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Nin-in-Eilph/Mablung.jpg]

 

Mablung is just in from the arena, but we caught him for a quick word.  Mablung, what do you have to say to your fans?

 

MABLUNG:  Mablung makes it rain.  You need this.  Your Horn is cleft and sundered.  You have no choice but to vote Mablung.

 

O...Oh OK Mablung! Thank you for your time!  And on her way into the locker room, here comes the opponent, Beravor.  Beravor, Mablung believes his resource generation is enough reason to vote for him over you.  What is your response?

 

Beravor.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Core-Set/Beravor.jpg]

 

BERAVOR:  And what will you buy with all that money?  You need cards.  I am the original draw engine.  You would like resources?  Pair me with Arwen and convert my cards into money.  I do not see Mablung with a worthwhile way to convert his money into cards.

 

(Mablung calls out from elsewhere: "Make it rain!")

 

There you have it, folks!  Resources versus cards, an age-old question.  Your votes will decide.  Which hero does it the best?

Mablung vs Beravor is a very interesting matchup (and close right now). I voted for Mablung since I like tactic very much but most times if I don't pair it with leadership or Arwen it's pretty short on resources (eagles :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] ) and Mablung can really help out in that regard.

 

Boromir (T) vs Bifur is also a close matchup witch I understand since Boromir is quite popular and has his great reading effect but Bifur is sheer value because you get low thread for good questing and resource fixing. I think Boromir will make it but not with >60% of all votes.

 

Gimli (T) and Imrahil (Le) is another very very close matchup. I like playing Imrahil more because you can get him going very easily (especially in multiplayer games) but the new tactic version seams to overshine his Leadership version right now.

 

Beregond (S) vs Merry (S) is a matchup which I am surprised is that close because I build way more decks with the new Beregond than using Merry in a deck. Beregond (S) vs Beregond (T) would be interesting although I think the spirit version would win it because it's new and shine ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I would vote for a tie if that would be allowed.

 

Lanwyn vs Erkendbrand seems to be a cakewalk for Erkenbrand which I am a little surprised of. I'm not into both of these heroes but would have guessed this one would be closer since Lanwyn is newer.

 

Aragald vs Grima was an easy vote for me (since I play 2+ player games 99% of my time) but there seem to be a lot of supporters out there for the little Rohan rat. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Caldara vs Bilbo is too close for me (Caldara not over 95% *shocker*). Help her!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Merry (T) vs Elfhelm is a tie right now which I can partly understand because both heroes are quite good but I really really like Elfhelm and the stats he can dish out to every hero in a game by putting useful horses on them. Great addition to my Dunedain Deck and I really hope he makes it through this round. Would keep them both in this vote if possible.

Beravor vs Mablung was probably the hardest one for me. I ended up going with Beravor in light of her new synergy with Spirit Legolas which I enjoyed quite a bit.

I'm really curious how Caldara is going to do. Last year, she came in 52th place (top 64, woohoo!). Since then, her deck archetype really blossomed. Then, it seems like the community almost got tired of her. Did she rise and fall too quickly to receive any votes this year? Clearly she'll beat Bilbo this round. But, does she sand a chance against Beregond (T) next round?

I don't think so. Caldara-Deck is fun for sure but outside of "her" deck type she is not that great of a hero. Beregond (T) on the other hand fits so well in so many decks as the wall you want for defense. So I think and hope he will advance in Round 2.

 

What about Gandalf? Do you guys think he will go deep again this year or will he fall off simply because you get tired of building decks with Gandalf+Elrond+X? With Legolas (T) and Arwen in his quarter he has at least strong competition and might fall in Round 4 ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Mablung/Beravor and Damrod/Eowyn (T) were really the only two that I had much issue with.  I get a chance to use Mablung more often, but Beravor is still my favorite.  Tactics Eowyn opened some doors, and it's awesome, but in the end, Traps are just too fun so Damrod takes the vote. 

 

Man, you guys really like Gimli (T).  

 

Wow, Dain is wining over Galdor.  I guess I can understand that, but I haven't been interested in dwarf decks for awhile.

 

I'm surprised Na'asiyah is winning by that much over Dori.  Has anyone actually used her very effectively yet?  I'd love to see those deck ideas!

 

I'm a sucker for the brothers, so I'm sad to see Faramir (Le) beating out Elrohir.

 

The rest I'm mostly in the majority votes with.

> Man, you guys really like Gimli (T).  

 

He was quite the powerful hero in the early days, often providing the only means to amass large amounts of damage in order to kill bosses.  Most notably, he was the best answer to killing the Balrog in Shadow and Flame.

 

And since he is up versus a rather lack-luster hero in this bracket, I'll happily hand him my vote for slaying the Balrog.

 

I think the most surprising result from this series of brackets is how badly Dori is losing to Na'asiyah.  Her restriction and ability are both incredibly costly.  Dori actually works well in some decks.  I can't say I expected Dori to win, but getting trounced by Na'asiyah is odd to me.

I don't know, I think I'll vote for Caldara over Beregond, actually. She has become really powerful lately, and more fun than your average power deck, if you ask me. I'll probably be tired of her by next year though, so it's now or never!

Tough matchups:

 

Legolas (T) vs Prince Imrahil (T)

Both of them offer some unique abilities. I think Imrahil is better though and will get even better with time when more allies are released

 

Beregond (T) vs Caldara

Ugh, Beregond is amazing, but Caldara offers some really crazy stuff

 

Boromir (T) vs Merry (S)

Boromir is the classic overpowered-but-boring guy... I still prefer him though, but Spirit Merry put a tough match

A couple of tough ones this time around.

Frodo v Mirlonde. I actually decided to go Mirlonde on this one since I'm pretty sure I use Mirlonde more often. It's probably my Lore bias though, and I bet Frodo will still have an easy victory here.

Eowyn Sp v Balin. This one was really tough. Both of these heroes are really good at what they do and make a great addition to any deck that just needs a hero of their color. In the end I went with Eowyn since she got a few new toys recently that increase her utility even more.

Gandalf v Gimli Le. Gandalf has proven himself to me before, even though he doesn't actually hit the table very often due to taking up so much deck space with all of his toys. The new Gimli seems really promising, but I haven't actually used him yet... In the end I succumbed to new and shiny syndrome, but I'm still not sure how I feel about this one yet.

Beregond Ta v Caldara. I mentioned my stance on this lineup before. Count me on team Caldara as long as she's around. She has been really fun this year!

Right now it looks like the most contentious match ups are:

 

Cirdan the Shipwright vs Thalin

Gandalf vs Gimli (Le)

Legolas (T) vs Prince Imrahil (T)

Beregond (T) vs Caldara

 

It will be interesting to see how these ones shake out.

Aragorn (Tactics) has a path to victory here, but it will be a tough fight.  He'll trounce Elladan and then Argalad without breaking a sweat, but then he has to face off against Eowyn (Tactics) mosty likely.  And then probably Galadriel.  Go Aragorn!  We have not had an Aragorn champion yet, and the tactics version is a good candidate.

Ouch Beregond and Caldara is a tough call indeed! Everything else was easy enough for me. I feel bad for leadership Gimli; I do like him a lot but he is facing Gandalf so early.

 

I really want to see Arwen do well! She has become my instant favorite hero as soon as she is out. I would love to see her and Aragorn face off for the title, that would be epic.

Not sure about that, would agree with the bottom two though.

I for myself prefer Legolas (T) over Imrahil (T) because he is a real proven hero and has his in-sphere attachments which makes him a real boss when it comes to fighting! Beregond vs Caldara is a tie for me, voted for Caldara but not sure if she makes it through.

If you look at the other matchups I think Cirdan should stomp Thalin in the ground. Wouldn't be surprised if he wins with more then 80% of all votes. He is so much better then Thalin.

Although I don't really like the Gandalf hero because I play 3+ multiplayer games most of the times and Gandalf is a difficult hero to bring to the table (the ally version is still so **** good) he took championship in 2014 so I think he will win against Gimli here pretty easily. Round 3 against Spirfindel will be more of a challenge for him but he will probably make top 4 again this year...

My statement was based on the small amount of votes at the time.  Each of those match ups was either at a 50/50 or 55/45 split.  Although, Cirdan and Gandalf have earned themselves quite a lot of votes since then.  It seems the Eomer/Gloin matchup has tightened quite a bit since then.

 

Edit: Personally, I don't really see how Beregond comes close to Caldara, but considering he got #3 last year means a lot of people like him.  I guess it is more because Caldara only fits into one type of deck while Beregond can be used in many...but, in my experience, it feels like Beregond dies ~50% of the time he is used by someone.  I guess Caldara "dies" 100% of the time I use her, but she's supposed to do that ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

A few of these matchups fit into the category of pitting the tricksy against the reliable. Makes for some interesting decisions between them:

 

Loragorn vs. Na'asiyah - Na'asiyah's ability is a more unusual one where Loragorn's is very simple but also very potent.

Haldir vs. Bard - Both are good Ranged attackers, but Bard's ability is a straightforward better at ranged attacking while Haldir offers timing shenanigans and staging area hits.

Legolas vs. Timrahil - Legolas is the classic Tactics hero, been around since the Core and very solid, while Timrahil offers new and exciting (if not perhaps as dependable) tricksy play to the Tactics sphere.

Beregond vs. Caldara - If you wanted to pick out a hero as the epitome of dependable, you'd struggle to find better than Beregond. And equally it's hard to get tricksier than Caldara.

Boromir vs. Spirit Merry - As Rajam said, Boromir is the classic OP but boring, whereas Spirit Merry enables Secrecy decks and other odd shenanigans.

 

And then there are the matchups I'm actually finding difficult to pick for which also somewhat fit this pattern:

 

Sam vs. Hama - Hama's tricky, Sam's pretty straightforward and reliable. As I said in the first round of voting I've been enjoying Hama more lately, but equally who doesn't love Sam? I might pick Hama in the end just because I think by most people's perspectives he'll be a bit of an underdog.

 

Elrond vs. Theodred - That extra resource every round from Theodred is super reliable and powerful, but then on the flipside Elrond buffs healing, smooths resources between spheres and can use Vilya. I kind of want to go Theodred because he's so good and somewhat underappreciated, but Elrond wins out majorly on cool factor.

 

Gandalf vs. Leadership Gimli - Off the top of my head I'd say Gandalf is Caldara's only real competition for the title of 'Tricksiest hero in the game', whereas new Gimli offers a powerful but straightforward ability by contrast. Gimli gets a definite advantage from being shiny and new, and the ability definitely appeals, but I love some of the shenanigans-y stuff you can do with Gandalf and I know that even after two years I've still barely dipped a toe in the vast ocean of possibilities he offers.

Beregond (T) vs Caldara is all about general vs specialized.  Caldara is amazing in basically one deck.  Beregond is very good in many decks.  I would rather take the more general hero.  Although some of that is because I find the Caldara deck is too strong and - dare I say - boring after a few plays.

 

Legolas (T) vs Prince Imrahil (T) is similar in a way.  You make "a Prince Imrahil deck" in the same way that you make "a Caldara deck", but there are more options with Imrahil since you aren't pigeon-holed into a single sphere like Caldara.  Meanwhile, while Beregond is the only hero with 4 defense (and sentinel), Legolas is one of 6 heroes that have 3 attack and ranged.  So in this case, my vote is for Imrahil.  Of course he is still new and shiny, so who knows what I would say next year.

 

Eomer vs Gloin is interesting.  Gloin is trying to be one of only 3 Dwarves to make it to the top 32, and it looks like no Dwarves will be in the top 16.  I think most people are bored with Dwarves, yet Gloin has the jank appeal.  Personally, I find his jank to be too difficult to set up, but then too game-breaking when it gets rolling.  Eomer, meanwhile, isn't very exciting unless he has Firefoot.  Nonetheless, I have been using Eomer lately with the new Imrahil, so he got my vote.

 

Gandalf vs Gilmi (Le) reminds me a little bit of Star Wars.  Gandalf is like the evil empire that is so ridiculously strong.  Gimli is the upstart underdog rebellion with limited abilities that everyone wants to root for.  Yet, despite the desire to root for the underdog, Gandalf is obviously so much better that even the PR disadvantage isn't enough to bring him down.

4 closer matchups this time:

 

Bormoir (T) > Merry (S) - I like the powerhouse Gondorian.

 

Beregond (T) > Caldara - Yeah Caldara has her Spirit deck and it is a good one and that's it. Beregond is just so much more useful in General. And playing a hero just to discard him disqualifies the hero for me him for me as soon as there is serious competition. It just lacks the "hero" Feeling.

 

Imrahil (T) > Legolas (T) - New Imrahil seems good, but so is Legolas. Anyway Imrahil gets the new and shiny Bonus and offers more "tricks" while Legolas is pretty 1-dimensional, so the prince gets my vote.

 

Eomer > Gloin - Eomer is strong and entertaining when build around (something I like very much). Gloin has is borderline broken Combo...

Currently Beregond appears to be pulling ahead of Caldara (55%). The Caldara deck is powerful and can be quite fun, but Beregond can fit into a lot of different types of decks.

 

Gandalf is significantly ahead of Gimli(L) (70%), which is quite sad. Gandalf just isn't much fun after the first time you build a deck with him, and no hero kills multiplayer games faster. I really wish they had kept Gandalf solely as an ally.

 

Congratulations to Aragorn(T), who is currently beating Elladan with 100% of the vote. I like twin decks quite a lot, but Aragorn(T) is powerful, fun, and fairly unique. Hard to vote against.

 

Finally, the closest matches have Legolas(T) beating Imrahil(T) and Eomer beating Gloin, both by 53%. Legolas(T) has always been a fantastic hero, and it speaks well of the game that some heroes from the core have yet to be overshadowed. Meanwhile Eomer has always seemed fairly boring and straightforward to me, but Gloin is full of possibilities.

Missed Round 1, but you better believe I'm voting from now on!

Just some comments about Round 1:

 

Na'asiyah winning over Dori:  Dori is solid. I'm sad he got so crushed, and by a suspicious newcomer at that!

 

Thorin Oakenshield vs Oin: Geez, 98 to 2. I'm not sure why, but Oin is definitely one of my favorite Dwarf heroes of all time, way over Thorin, who has too much threat. I always enjoyed Oin's versatility... Starts blue, turns red with the army, able to do basically any job. He's great. Don't feel down, Oin. Your fans are still out there.

 

Glorfindel (Sp) vs Rossiel:  I know Rossiel doesn't compare when it comes to outright stats, but man I love her in Silvan decks. Just so cool. Have a classic Silvan deck, mix in some of her victory display cards, and you have a great defender in a trait that generally is very weak. Plus, getting rid of those enemies permanently is SO great. I would have voted for you Rossiel! 

 

Grima vs Argalad:  Strangely this was the closest match-up. I can honestly say I think I've used Grima once, and I didn't like the threat trade-off; but this makes me want to test him out some more. 

 

Lanwyn vs Erkenbrand: I definitely would have picked Lanwyn. She's great in nearly any deck, especially if you've got some readying effects. Getting rid of surge is SOOOO wonderful, and she can attack nicely too.

 

Caldara vs Bilbo Baggins:  Wow, did not expect Caldara to win by such a margin. I mean, she's gotten better, but I still would prefer the extra card draw.

 

Aragorn (Le) vs Amarthiul: I totally didn't see this coming. Guess I just assumed people still were in love with Leadergorn. Good for you Amarthiul!

I was just taking a closer look at the brackets and if Caldara were to win this match up versus Beregond it would probably end up being Tactics Aragorn versus Caldara in a much later round.  Dang, that would be tough for me to choose between so maybe it's just as well that it looks like I won't be having to make that choice.

 

Edit: Nevermind, I overlooked Galadriel down there and if Beregond beats Caldara I'm sure Galadriel would too.

Yea, I love the hero Gandalf and in our group it's almost expected that someone is going to use him so most of us don't even build considering the ally version until after everyone's decided on what heroe they are going to use.  (the group I play with once a month likes to build new decks in-between each session) 

 

I actually really love him in a support deck since he has access to so many tools, but he is beast enough that you can use him in a heavy questing or combat deck, or balanced jack-of-all deck, or even combo with Elrond for more ridiculousness.  

 

My favorite build of his so far though is the enabler deck that uses all nearly every zero cost Action event in the game to play through 4+ cards a turn.   It's so much fun to see what you can do with it and how fast you can accelerate the other players decks.

 

 

As for this round of votes, again I only have a few I had to consider.  My relative meh attitude towards hobbits and dwarves definitely shows. 

 

Boromir (T) vs Merry (S) - I had to vote for Merry just because I like the repeat-ability to lower your threat each turn, giving you the most reliable method for staying in secrecy.  Now if only secrecy was more worth it out of Spirit!

 

Frodo vs Mirlonde - I actually read this wrong!  I say Baggins, assumed it was Bilbo and voted for Mirlonde.   :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

Beregond (T) vs Caldara - I'm in love with Caldara atm, so even though Beregond is amazing, he had to take a back seat.

 

Theoden (S) vs Legolas (S) - I don't care for Santa too much and would rather give new Legolas the love.

I'm also rather surprised that Grima was knocked out of the running so early, though I do wish that his ability only effected the player running him. He might actually see use. Beaten by Argalad is pathetic. That guy is so mediocre.

I actually really like Argalad, and I have been using him a lot lately. He can usually quest for 2 while also dealing 1 damage to an enemy each round. It's not flashy, buy it adds up, and I have found it to be especially useful in Lore, which can be a little light in the attack department anyway.

Getting into some tough choices here!

 

Sam vs Merry (T) - Sam is still such a beast and his action advantage is more versatile.  

 

Frodo vs Faramir (Le) - I do like the new Faramir, especially with Ents.  But I love Hobbits and secrecy and Frodo is still my favorite spirit Hobbit.

 

Eowyn (S) vs Celeborn - Really tough choice here, but I'm going with Celeborn.  He enables an entire deck type that works in multiplayer.  Eowyn is still really strong, but she has more competition for dedicated questors (mainly her Tactics version).

 

Theoden (S) vs Amarthiul - Theoden is pretty good, but a bit too narrow in application.  I really wish he had 3 player.  Meanwhile, Amarthiul works well in a Dunedain deck (very fun) and with mounts.

 

Cirdan vs Erestor - Erestor just opens up so much design space for deck building.

 

Elrond vs Erkenbrand - I'm probably higher on Erkenbrand than most people and I pretty much refuse to use Vilya anymore, but Elrond is still better.  His healing bonus is so amazing in multiplayer.

 

Aragorn (Lo) vs Beorn - Beorn's stock is rising as we get more damage cancellation.  I'm really looking forward to playing him with the side quest that reduces enemies' attack.  He is such a unique hero.  Meanwhile, Aragorn is a dangerous hero to try to bring to a game.

 

Gandalf vs Glorfindel (S) - I know Glorfindel is overplayed, but Strider has breathed some new life into him.  

 

Haldir vs Dain - Dwarves are still boring.

 

Legolas (T) vs Pippin (Lo) - I fully expect Legolas to win this, but I think Pippin is one of the most splashable heroes in the game.  In the right deck, his card draw is incredible and I've lost count of how many times the increased engagement value has saved our bacon.

 

Arwen vs Denethor (Le) - Two great options for resource acceleration.  I'll go with the one that opens up more design space.

 

Beregond (T) vs Gimli (T) - It was a good run, Gimli.

 

Galadriel vs Mablung - Another really tough choice.  I'll take the guy that has basically the only resource acceleration in tactics (RIP Horn of Gondor).

 

Aragorn (T) vs Argalad - I like what Argalad brings to the table, but Aragorn (T) makes combat and engagement a highly entertaining puzzle to solve.

 

Eomer vs Eowyn (T) - The new Eowyn makes mono tactics viable.  Eomer isn't very exciting right now.  I'm hoping for a new version in the last saga box.

Uff, plenty of tough matchups now!

 

Frodo vs Faramir (Le)

Faramir is cool, but works only with ents tbh. Frodo is an amazing defender and his low threat is more than welcome

 

Éowyn (S) vs Celeborn

Although Celeborn works only with silvans (much like LeFaramir works only with ents), his bonuses are that much better imo, and I'd rather prefer utility heroes instead of "dedicated" heroes (heroes that "only" quest, attack, or defend)

 

Gandalf vs Glorfindel (S)

Glorfindel has stats, Asfaloth, and enables secrecy decks. Gandalf has Wizard Pipe, Gandalf's Staff, Narya, Expert Treasure-Hunter, and even more important, Word of Command. Although by using him no one else can use his allies counterparts, as a solo player I'm not that bothered by that. Honestly just Word of Command on his own makes hero-Gandalf rise some levels for me

 

Haldir of Lorien vs Dain Ironfoot

Haldir is fun, dwarves are boring, but Dain's ability is on par with Celeborn...

 

Legolas (T) vs Pippin (Lo)

Lore Pippin works so well... Legolas is fun and has an interesting ability, but I feel that is hard to build and plan a strategy around him, or throw him around as a good 3rd option fit, specially considering other tactics heroes outclass him imo

 

Arwen Undómiel vs Denethor (Le)

ugh, how can this matchup happen so early >_> both of them are so incredible and deserve to reach much higher positions; it's very likely that Arwen is the best spirit hero, and Denethor is the best leadership hero... yeah I'll have to go with Denethor. I've built more decks with him around lately

 

My votes:

 

Sam Gamgee vs Merry (T)

Frodo vs Faramir (Le)

Éowyn (S) vs Celeborn

Theoden (S) vs Amarthiul

Cirdan the Shipwright vs Erestor

Aragorn (Lo) vs Beorn

Gandalf vs Glorfindel (S)
Elrond vs Elkenbrand

Haldir of Lorien vs Dain Ironfoot

Legolas (T) vs Pippin (Lo)

Arwen Undomiel vs Denethor (Le)

Beregond (T) vs Gimli (T)

Galadriel vs Mablung

Aragorn (T) vs Argalad

Éomer vs Éowyn (T)

Funny, because I think only the Denethor Arwen match-up is somewhat close :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I ended up voting for Denethor as the headstart he provides you with is awesome and it doesn't take much work to make him a great defender (if 3 defense shouldn't be enough anyway). Arwen surely is one of the top spirit heroes, works incredibly well with the Noldor mechanic (especially Elven Light) and while in multiplayer both hit the table regularly, Denethor has the edge for me in solo play as finding a hero for questing and getting other forms of carddraw (what Arwen is doing most of the time; consuming her own ressource generation) is easier than having a defender who helps getting the deck started and smoothes out ressources. Excited who will make it in the end!

Arwen v Denethor is really rough, I would vote for either of them all the way to the finish line this year. I ended up voting Arwen here, since I play more Noldor decks than Gondor decks.

> Frodo vs Faramir (Le)
> 
> Faramir is cool, but works only with ents tbh.

If you genuinely think that, it really seems like a failure of imagination on your part. Faramir works with all sorts of allies. You can ready up utility allies like Gleowine or Warden of Healing or you can take various other allies with versatile statlines that aren't Ents, e.g. Gandalf, Elrond, Saruman, Gildor, Galdor, a bunch of Gondor allies if Boromir(Ld)/Visionary Leadership are in play, a bunhc of Dwarves if Dain is in play, Outlands if you really must play them, some Silvans on the round they enter play if Celeborn, some other Noldor if Lords of the Eldar has been played, maybe Northern Trackers, Wardens of Annuminas... there are so many options, and that's without even getting into the possibility of engaging things out of usual phases or exhausting allies for other reasons, like A Very Good Tale or some encounter card effects.

All that said, Frodo is really good and you're entirely justified in voting for him, but to say that Faramir "only works with ents" is simply not true.

 

So my take, extracting the most difficult decisions:

 

Sam Gamgee vs Merry (T)

Frodo vs Faramir (Ld) - for all that impassioned support I just gave, this was a tough decision, but Faramir is a ton of fun.

Theoden (S) vs Amarthiul - Dunedain are super fun, whereas I've never really gotten into Rohan.

Cirdan the Shipwright vs Erestor - Both are great, I give Cirdan the edge because of Narya (also I love the character).

Gandalf vs Glorfindel (S) - Gandalf is one of the most interesting heroes in the game, Glorfindel one of the most boring.

Elrond vs Elkenbrand - I like Erkenbrand, but Elrond is a long-standing favourite for so many reasons.

Haldir of Lorien vs Dain Ironfoot - Again, interesting vs boring.

Legolas (T) vs Pippin (Lo) - I've never understood this community's obsession with Legolas, but I'd rather have Pippin.

Beregond (T) vs Gimli (T) - Maybe I'm bitter because Beregond beat Caldara, but also powering up Gimli with a mountain of hit points is a deeply satisfying combat solution.

Galadriel vs Mablung - Everything is better with Galadriel.

Aragorn (T) vs Argalad - I just really like Argalad recently.

Éomer vs Éowyn (T) - This isn't even a contest to me.

 

And the really difficult choices:

 

Éowyn (S) vs Celeborn

Especially have played Progression-style a lot, I get bored of Eowyn. But that aside, there's a reason she's still incredibly ubiquitous to this day, and it's because she's incredibly good. And she works just about anywhere, whereas Celeborn is pigeonholed into Silvan decks and Silvan decks only. As much as I kind of want to go against the norm, I think I have to give this one to Eowyn.

 

Aragorn (Lo) vs Beorn

These have been two of my favourite heroes for quite some time. Beorn I reckoned back in January to be the most pure fun hero in the game, but then that Loragorn threat reset is just so reliable, and so powerful for the kinds of crazy shenanigans it can enable. In the end I may have to give the nod to Loragorn just for his versatility, but it pains me to vote against the bear.

 

Arwen Undomiel vs Denethor (Ld)

Oh wow. This is like the Mablung/Beravor matchup from before, but on an even higher level. These are two of the absolute most powerful heroes in the game for how they help with one of the most central and fundamental aspects of the game - in this case resources for both of them. Looking at my decks on RingsDB (including some unfinished and unpublished ones), I have the same number of good/interesting decks with each of them. Denethor only provides 2 additional resources, and afterwards just helps with smoothing, but he provides those extra resources at the very beginning of the game, when they are absolutely most needed. Meanwhile Arwen offers a resource every round in exchange for a discarded card, which in some decks isn't really even a downside. Arwen's a good quester, Denethor's a decent defender. Denethor has a lower threat cost by 1.

...is it possible for me to abstain from voting on one of the matchups? Because I'd seriously consider it at this point.

Looks like it is, I can submit the votes I've already picked and it just leaves that one matchup still open for me to vote. Maybe I'll decide about this one later.

The really hard one for me is Aragorn (T) vs. Argalad: Argalad has done so much for my silvan deck and he is so useful. Tactigorn is SUCH an efficient killing machine but he doesn't really work for me I am first and foremost a solo player! Lol. Ended up going with Aragorn still, even if I have never successfully built a solo deck featuring his skills.

There is no way that Elrond isn't winning round 5 and making it to the semi finals. None of the heroes he will be facing until then are anywhere near his power level of over 9000

The difficult ones:

Sam-Merry:I'm going for Sam because of Halbarad (either), Bill, Son of Arnor, make no notice, hobbit cloak and comon cause.

Aragorn-Beorn:I decide Beorn only because the search web helped me while writing this.

Gandalf-Glorfindel:Gandalf is mainly powerful because his toys, but that makes him interesting and fun. Glorfy is just plain bad design.

Elrond-Erkenbrand:Down from the hills leaped Erkenbrand, lord of Westfold. Elrond smashed him with ultrahealing, ultrarecruiting and The One Ring to Put Them All into Play.

The Winners and the Losers
(The bottom 47 or "those that did not make the top 32")

The Bottom 3:

Fatty Bolger

Pippin (S)

Oin

 

These are the same bottom three as last year... ouch...

 

 

The Losers (dropped by 10 or more positions)

Na'asiyah  [-10]

Faramir (Lo)  [-11]

Denethor (Lo)  [-14]

Lanwyn  [-14]

Halbarad  [-15]

Rossiel  [-16]

Aragorn (Le)  [-18]

Galdor of the Havens  [-27]

Damrod  [-29]

 

 

The Winners (jumped up by 10 or more positions)

Caldara  [+23]

Legolas (S)  [+22]

Prince Imrahil (T)  [+20]

Glóin  [+18]

Mirlonde  [+18]

Beregond (S)  [+14]

Gimli (Le)  [+14]

 

A lot of things make sense from this data. Sure Glóin and Caldara got knocked out early, but "Glóin Jank" and the Caldara deck were really popular this year. Likewise, they saw a jump in votes.

We didn't have Swiss rounds (gosh that would have been awful), so it's impossible to take any of this as absolute. There are outliers.
For instance, Damrod dropped 29 places! I thought we loved Damrod and trap decks? Well, he went up against Éowyn (T) and got slaughtered. Luck of the draw on that one.

Holy crap! 3 different 50% splits as of my vote.  Frodo vs Faramir (Le), Eowyn (S) vs Celeborn and Haldir vs Dain.     My votes are to the top bracket in each of those!   

 

As much as I love Galadriel, I'd still pick the resource generation of Mablung since Tactics just doesn't have a reliable way to gain extra resources - especially with the change to the Horn.  

 

I'm in the majority vote everywhere else.   The only tricky vote for me this time around was Eomer/Eowyn.

Frodo vs. Faramir was a very difficult decision for me, and is still split at 50% after my vote (I eventually ended up choosing Faramir for his extreme versatility). I would have expected Arwen vs. Denethor to be evenly split, but Arwen is winning with 60% as of my vote. Surprising - I think Denethor opens up a ton of space for new decks (Arwen does too, but I think to a lesser extent) and is a pretty amazing hero.

Glorfindel, Denethor, and Mablung all falling behind is a big disappointment. Those guys all rock. Celeborn beating Eowyn is also sad, but that could still turn around. I guess I have a strong preference for flexible, splashable heroes. Celeborn, Galadriel, and Gandalf are all a bit more limited in their application I find. The Arwen Denethor matchup is really tough, and I'm pretty sure she's being picked because she's an attractive elf girl and Denethor is an old man. Pity.

I think there are balanced cards that could at least make them more playable.

 

SpPippin needs two things:

1) Good hobbit heroes that synergize with -- or at least don't actively work against -- his ability.

2) A compelling reason to put enemies back into staging

 

At 2-wp for 6 threat he's got fairly efficient bones for a spirit quester, but the only hobbit with a complementary ability is LoPippin, which is no help at all.  And none of the hobbit heroes have an ability that wants enemies in staging.  If SpPippin's ability weren't restricted to all-hobbit decks, he might be a useful part of Dunhere, Haldir, LoFaramir, and trap decks already.  If LoPippin were LoMerry, SpPipppin might already find himself in some hobbit decks as well.

 

Fatty's ability is already situationally useful and powerful, and works well with a role as defender, which is the best fit for his meager stats.  The main problem is that 2/3 is too fragile for a hero defender, so unless hero Dori is out he can't defend without substantial buffing.  And the best Hobbit defender buffs are Bill the Pony, Hobbit Cloak, and Staff of Lebethron, all of which are same sphere as Sam and two resources cheaper for him.  So even though Fatty has a little better defensive bones, Sam can defend almost as well against higher threat enemies, for less resources, while also questing for three, for just 1 more threat and without raising threat as part of his ability.  What Fatty needs is a hobbit-friendly defensive attachment *in spirit*.

 

Oin needs action advantage, a mount, and Elfhelm on the table.  Obviously that requires 2+ decks, but if Dain and Elfhelm are in play, same-sphere Windfola with a 5-dwarf deck would let him quest for four or attack for four, not bad at all for an 8-cost hero.  What's really needed is a dwarfish mount (a pony, obviously) that allows post-questing readiness, that'd be gold for Oin (and Thorin and Dain).

Also she is repeatable resource generation (or card draw with Elven Light) where old man Denethor is just a burst econ and then is just a solid defender.  Sure, it depends on what you need, but in a vacuum, Arwen is just better long term.

Arwen might be better long term, but I feel that a lot of quests are decided in the first 2-3 rounds (or at least the trajectory is set). The resources Denethor provides on round 1 are far more valuable than resources you could get from Arwen on rounds 7 and 8.

Um... what?

Celeborn I'll grant you, he's limited to Silvan decks by design. But Galadriel is one of the most splashable heroes, offering repeatable threat reduction and card draw, plus action advantage for your allies; and the only reason Gandalf isn't also one of the most splashable heroes in the game is that he's 14 threat. His ability, in addition to being de facto card draw, is incredibly flexible and lets you do basically whatever you want with him. I don't get how you can see those two as limited.

Time for a matchup spotlight!

 

A-killin' in Ithilien

This matchup spotlight is on that Captain of Gondor, Faramir, and the Ringbearer himself, Frodo Baggins!

 

Faramir.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Land-of-Shadow/Faramir.jpg]

Faramir says:

 

I am your favorite "what if" hero.  What if I had joined the Fellowship instead of my brother Boromir?  What if I had taken the Ring from Frodo in Ithilien?  What if I had burned with my father Denethor?  What if my Lore version art was on my Leadership card?  What if I have to face my brother in the semi-finals?  So many possibilities, my friends.  But beyond those are certainties.  Excepting Treebeard himself, only I can rouse an Ent on the turn it is played.  But I do it for free.  Only I can give you an extra game-saving use from your core Gandalf, or let leadership Anborn use his ability and attack as well.  Vote for Faramir, friends, and see your allies' strength grow.

 
Frodo-Baggins.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Conflict-at-the-Carrock/Frodo-Baggins.jpg]
 
Frodo says:
 
Hullo! It seems I've got to explain myself.  Well, I'm a Hobbit of the Shire, and although we are small folk, we are hardier than we seem.  Trust me to be the defender you need in your deck, even if I'm exhausted.  I have a good friend in Sam Gamgee, a stalwart ally in my sphere.  Do you need to get someplace quietly?  I can help with my low starting threat of 7, and access to many threat-reducing cards in my sphere too.  And if you bring along a Pipe for me and my friends, I can help you find whatever else you need.  Although I can't carry the Ring in your Saga, I can let you quest all-in without worrying about losing a hero to an unexpected attack.  I can shrug off a bit of Archery and, if you don't mind boosting my hit points with some Boots from Erebor, an Ent Draught, or other ways, I can save your whole table from a round or two of Archery at the cost of some threat.  Now I've said my piece, I hope you will vote wisely!
--------------------
 
Right now Frodo leads Faramir 56% to 44%.  Voting on this round closes at noon CST on Thursday Dec 15!  Make sure to get your vote in!

Galadriel can't help in the early game without Nenya, so you are forced to select heroes with high WP and action advantage, like the classic Boromir-Glorfindel deck. In multiplayer, I completely agree that she's quite splashable though. Gandalf though? His toys and style of play really do dominate a deck. I find that whenever I toss Gandalf in, this needy fellow demands all sorts of changes.

In most of my decks with Galadriel, Nenya isn't even included.  Also, in the decks where it is included, it is usually only there to give her access to Lore with the upside of maybe being able to use its ability.  Occasionally the ability from Nenya comes in handy, but nearly every turn I'm using her threat reduction/card draw ability instead.  Her passive ability definitely helps in the beginning, so I'm not sure what you mean by her not being able to help without Nenya.  Galadriel could have 0 willpower and she would still be used in my decks.

 

I'd say she is quite a bit stronger in solo than in multiplayer, mainly because she allows you to control the game by keeping your threat down and drawing an extra card per turn. 

 

Edit: Also, Cirdan beating Erestor right now is bonkers.

Matchups get more exciting in this round:

 

Cirdan vs Erestor is a powermatchup and I'm a little surprised that Cirdan leads Erestor right now. I voted for him because he is such a strong hero especially in multiplayer. But I thought that Erestor has a wide fanbase and that he would outhype Cirdan. We will see but I root for Cirdan and really hope he can stay on top of Erestor.

 

Gandalf vs Glorfindel is another matchup with two heroes that have made deep runs in former years but I guess Gandalf will win that matchup because you can go crazy with his abilities and toys.

 

Arwen vs Denethor (LE) is the third matchup I would spotlight because both heroes seem to be very popular when it comes to deckbuilding right now. Denethor gives you a jumpstart at the beginning of the game but (at least to me) falls of as the game goes on. Arwen is more versatile when it comes to resource generation because you don't have to place the resource on Arwen if you don't need another spirit resource. So for me it was clear who would receive my vote but I could see Denethor causing an "upset" here.

 

Each other matchup was not hard for me to vote on. What do you guys think? Especially the first matchup mentioned is really hard because either hero would have won against 70% of all other heroes in Round 3 for sure.

The Frodo and Faramir (Le) match-up being so close really surprised me. Don't get me wrong, Frodo is a great card and I have used him to achieve great many victories. But, with the alt-art Faramir recently coming out, I have built decks just so Faramir hits the table. I want to see my flashy new card in use. Honestly, I thought this detail alone would push Faramir well past Frodo. I suppose in-hind sight this is lunacy - there is no president for an "alt-art bump".

 

It's also startling to see Celeborn being so close to Éowyn. I would have thought Éowyn would blow him away. Perhaps we're starting to get a little fatigued and she's going the way of Glorfindel (powerful but a little too omnipresent)?

 

I also thought people were in love with Haldir. Like, I thought we were all members of his fan-club. To see Dain doing so well against is surprising.

Dain's the only hero who can dominate a game while standing around doing nothing.  Whether that's a reason to vote for him or against him is a matter of taste.

Since there's no stated criteria, it's certainly valid to vote for "more interesting" over "more powerful", and vice versa.  If there were stated criteria, the contest would be more predictable, I think.

 

I do wish past winners were excluded from the contest, and the brackets were "regionalized" by sphere.

I know that something has to change for next year. There was not enough competition in the first two round (very few tight races and upsets). We spent the first two rounds in a sort-of meat grinder and now we're getting to the really good match-ups. This is a product of using prior years' results. The effects keep compounding. This has caused the worst heroes to make their to the bottom and stay there and the best to make there way to the top.

 

I almost did this by sphere. The top four would then be composed of one representative form each sphere. I opted not to this in the final hour because I felt the variation in match-ups would be inhibited. For instance we wouldn't get great match-ups like Ciridan and Erestor or Arwen and Denethor. I really like the idea of having wildly different heroes facing off.

 

Maybe each sphere could send 4 heroes. The top 16 would then be re-seeded. That wouldn't make the competition any longer to finish and it would allow for early in-sphere fighting. I guess that is sort-of how NCAA basketball works. Most of the games are in-conference and then top teams from each conference are re-seeded into the March bracket (I know it doesn't quite work that way).

 

I really like the idea of excluding past winners

Lets all have a moment of silence for Erkenbrand - essentially the second/third best defender in the game.   (He is second/third due to Beregond x2!)   He sadly didn't stand a chance against Elrond.  (Currently 93% vs 7%)

 

The other matches that have been by a similar margin where very justifiable:

 

Thalin vs Fatty.  

Bard vs Pippin (S).  

Caldara vs Bilbo.    

Thorin vs Oin.    

Aragorn (T) vs Elladan.    

Arwen vs Nori.    

Aragorn (Lo) vs Na'asiyah.   

 

Erkenbrand deserves better than just 7%!

I'm hoping he makes it all the way to semifinals. I'd take him over Amarthiul, Loregorn, or even Elrond. Can't say the same for Cirdan.

It's funny, Elrond is actual my top non-Beregond defender. He has the highest Def in the sphere that has burning brand and is also the best for healing (which he even helps with)

LoDenethor deserves a mention here.  Same defense as Elrond, eligible and same-sphere for Burning Brand, and benefits from the cheap Gondorian Shield if you have access to tactics.  Plus if he doesn't defend he has a useful ability he can do.  (True also for Elrond, but only once he has Vilya).

 

Elrond does have an extra hp, but he also costs significantly more threat.

I agree that Erestor is a powerful hero and should get a better place in the hero ranking then he might get if he looses this round.

But Cirdan... man that hero is bonkers! Big Quester, "free" carddraw + readying with Narya (good target for Light of Valinor too) is just so **** good. In our 4-player-games he does a s**t ton of work and for me he is a real contender for top spot in this years contest!

I think that's the difference.  Erestor wins games, but not in a board-state changing way.  So people seem to not like that.  Erestor tends the win the game around turn 1 - which I suppose, is not very fun to some people.  "Oh, I drew my starting hand and first 4 cards.  I guess I won."  As opposed to Cirdan, "Oh wow, we were going to die, but then Cirdan saved us by readying two allies with Narya!!!"

 

I think that of the heroes that have not won before, the only heroes I think that deserve the top spot are Aragorn (T), Pippin, Denethor (Le), Caldara, Dain Ironfoot, and Erestor.  After this round, only one of those will remain which is pretty astounding.  There are some other powerful heroes that I would be okay with winning (like Gandalf or Glorfindel), even if I don't particularly enjoy playing them.

 

Aragorn - He has allowed Tactics to do what it was meant to do, but ordinarily did terribly.

Pippin - He has always been strong, but he has grown even stronger as the card pool has grown and as scenarios continue to force engagement.  He can often draw you two cards per turn.  In Aragorn (T) decks he can often draw you far more than two cards per turn.

Denethor / Erestor - They win you the game on the first turn

Dain Ironfoot - Obviously strong

Caldara - An interesting ability that became incredibly powerful as the card pool expanded.

"Easy" round for me. Only one tough matchup:

 

Aragorn (T) vs Eowyn (T)

Reaaaally hard choice. I don't use tactics very much so it's difficult to judge here. Tactigorn has his usual toys and those amazing abilities, Éowyn is a questing powerhouse and has super low threat, plus the ability to kill bosses... My vote is because I've used Tactigorn to success before, meanwhile I've yet to use T-Éowyn for a 1st time

 

My votes:

 

Sam Gamgee vs Boromir (T)

Frodo Baggins vs Éowyn (S)

Amarthiúl vs Cirdan the Shipwright

Elrond vs Aragorn (Lo)

Gandalf vs Haldir of Lorien

Legolas (T) vs Arwen Undómiel

Beregond (T) vs Galadriel

Aragorn (T) vs Éowyn (T)

Sam vs Boromir (T) - I'll take the versatile Hobbit over the Captain of Cheese.

 

Frodo vs Eowyn (S) - This one was tough for me.  As someone that plays a lot of 4 player, Eowyn's ability to quest for 8 is too good to pass up.

 

Amarthiul vs Cirdan - I haven't tried Noldor much yet, but Amarthiul is a key piece of the Dunedain archetype and opens up some new ways to play the game. 

 

Elrond vs Aragorn (Lo) - Tactics Aragorn is by far my favorite Aragorn, so its hard to vote for any of the others over a powerhouse like Elrond.

 

Haldir vs Gandalf - My hate for Gandalf is well documented.

 

Legolas (T) vs Arwen - Tough choice, but I think I have to go with the classic Legolas.  Arwen is great, but I really miss being able to count on being able to play her ally version.

 

Beregond (T) vs Galadriel - Another tough choice.  Galadriel is better for solo, but Beregond is amazing in multiplayer.

 

Aragorn (T) vs Eowyn (T) - While I appreciate what tactics Eowyn brings to deck building space, I think she is still the 2nd best Eowyn.  Meanwhile, Aragorn is the best tactics hero, imo.

Chose Boromir over Sam. I rarely play low threat decks and he is pretty awesome solo. Sam is the best hobbit, but I much prefer Boromir.

Chose Eowyn because she is pretty great in multiplayer.

Haldir because he is more fun than Gandalf and ally Gandalf is so good.

Arwen is fantastic, Legolas has competition for best ranged character. It would be interesting to see a Legolas Haldir matchup.

I chose Beregond and hope he makes it all the way to the top this year.

Naturally, these have progressed to be a bit harder decisions for me.

 

Sam Gamgee vs Boromir (T) - I just don't like hobbit decks that much.  definitely bias. 

Frodo Baggins vs Éowyn (S) - Frodo is a stand-alone hobbit who can do work without being in a hobbit deck, but he doesn't cut it against how awesome Eowyn is, especially in the 4 player games that I mostly play in.

Amarthiúl vs Cirdan the Shipwright - Sure, Cirdan has some strong will and neat tools, but give me Dunedain and traps all day!

Elrond vs Aragorn (Lo) - Elrond is just the better.

Gandalf vs Haldir of Lorien - this was the hardest decision for me, because Haldir is absolutely amazing, but I love the redicoulous things that I can accomplish with Gandalf

Legolas (T) vs Arwen Undómiel -  Again, a hard decision.  Legolas is a badass, but with his Ally card out, he sees less play.   With Arwen's hero card, her ally hardly sees play.  

Beregond (T) vs Galadriel - AGAIN a hard decision.  The lord of defending win against Galadriel and her tricks, powerful as they may be.

Aragorn (T) vs Éowyn (T)  - had to pick Eowyn again due to how great she can be for splashing in tactics into other decks - like paired with Haldir!  

 

Also, I dream of an Eowyn vs Eowyn finale. 

 

Eowyn (S) can take Sam or Boromir for certain.   It will be a harder fight against Elrond or Cirdan.   I'd vote her all the way through myself, but I feel the community wouldn't. 

 

Eowyn (T) has a near impossible road ahead of her.  Beregond or Galadriel will be a close fight and after that it is either Gandalf or Arwen.   I can't imagine her winning out against either of them.

 

My prediction for the end result is here: Cirdan will win after beating Amarthiul, Eowyn (S), and Arwen in the final round.

I anticipate the final four will include Arwen, Galadriel, and Elrond. What I'm curious to see is how Sam fares against Eowyn next.

We are getting to the interesting part :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Boromir(T) > Sam - Both great but Boromir carriers me through my campaign :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]. Also I tent to play higher threat decks or pack few threat reduction, so Sam looses much value.

Eowyn(S) > Frodo - I like Frodo, but prefer Eowyn, back in the core set days she was much more useful than Frodo was at his release (for me) and even today you see her quite often.

Cirdan > Amarthiul - Never played any of these very often, but Cirdan offers much utility in any deck. Amarthiul needs a bit of set up and a specific deck build around him. I like that these heroes exist, but Cirdan seems more useful in general.

Elrond > Aragorn (Lo) - I love both but Elrond is a god :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I played so many games with him and he amplified our healing by so much saved tons of ressources with his ring, defend when needed quested if possible. Loragorn usually his my excuse to cut all threat reduction :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Gandalf > Haldir - Haldir doesn't even make it to the top 3 ranged heroes (imo Legolas, Lanwyn and my new found friend Brand), so he doesn't stand a chance against a wizard.

Legolas > Arwen - Man these two are similar. Both great heroes, both awesome allies. But as I stated before (I think), Arwen hero is easier to exchange. So I vote for Legolas.

Beregond > Galadriel - The Gondorian wall deserves much more praise than I can write here, he is sooo good. Galadriel is awesome as well, but Beregond can save you from so much more Trouble!

Aragorn(T) > Eowyn(T) - Aragorn only really shines in multiplayer but there he goes off! Eowyn is still quite limited in her use.

It's funny, this round isn't particularly difficult for me. In almost every bracket, it's a character I play a lot against a character I rarely play, making my choices easy.

 

The only two that don't fall into that category are Beregond v Galadriel and Legolas v Arwen, all of whom I use often. In both cases, I voted for the one who hasn't won a hero championship in the past. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

OK, things are narrowing down to the point where I feel I can comment on each matchup individually. Still going to shift the more interesting ones to the bottom though.

 

Sam Gamgee vs Boromir (T) - This is incredibly simple for me. Boromir is boring, Sam is great.

 

Elrond vs Aragorn (Lo) - I am actually a massive fan of Loragorn, and he's let me do some truly ridiculous things over the many games I've used him, but Elrond is also amazing. Vilya of course is incredibly powerful, but even just Elrond's own innate abilities I keep finding more and more useful over time. Incidentally I love that about this game that I'm still gaining additional appreciation for a hero who's been around longer than I've been playing the game.

 

Gandalf vs Haldir of Lorien - Haldir is a ton of fun, but Gandalf, as I've noted in previous rounds, can do just about anything. The level of power, efficiency and incredible variety Gandalf can offer your deckbuilding is just so difficult to match.

 

Legolas (T) vs Arwen Undómiel - Another easy one for me. Legolas is just a strong attacker with a nice ability. Arwen's resource generation is super-powerful and enables so many different decks.

 

Beregond (T) vs Galadriel - Similar to the above. Beregond is good, but all he is is a (very) strong defender. Galadriel's incredible support abilities just make so many things work so much better.

 

And the difficult ones for me this round:

 

Frodo Baggins vs Éowyn (S) - Frodo is a great hero, and there's a part of me which really wants to vote against Eowyn given how ubiquitous she is, but she really is just that good, so getting past my tendency to go against the grain, she really is the better choice.

 

Aragorn (T) vs Éowyn (T) - I haven't actually used Tactics Aragorn that much, bbut I know how amazing he is. I've used Tactics Eowyn even less, but she's also an incredibly powerful hero. Eowyn offers Tactics something fairly unique and opens up a bunch of new deckbuilding possibilities for the sphere. Aragorn meanwhile, though he does offer some new options, mostly just does the standard Tactics things; it's just that he does them incredibly well (I would argue better than any other hero). That makes it pretty hard to choose between the two, but I picked Aragorn because he helped me beat Siege of Annuminas yesterday.

 

Amarthiúl vs Cirdan the Shipwright - And this one I haven't voted on yet. Neither of these heroes quite makes it into my list of favourites, but they're both somewhat on the cusp I'd say. Amarthiul I really tend to take as a representative of the Dunedain deck archetype as a whole, and I've had a lot of fun with that archetype, plus he's gained favour of late in combination with Elfhelm/Armoured Destrier; whereas Cirdan offers that extra deck speed/filtering and can use Narya, not to mention the 4 willpower, plus he has a truly epic beard. I like Cirdan more as a character I suppose. Mechanics-wise while Cirdan is obviously more flexible and widely applicable, Amarthiul I think arguably has more going for him in and of himself. It would be unreasonable to consider Cirdan without also considering Narya though, and Narya is a pretty big deal. I could still go either way on this one, though unlike Denethor vs. Arwen last round I do intend to actually cast a vote before the round ends.

Sam vs Eowyn (S) - Both heroes are quite good and both heroes are old news by now.  Eowyn might be the stronger hero, but she has competition for dedicated questers.  Sam, meanwhile, has a totally unique ability and is the lynchpin of many decks.

 

Cirdan vs Elrond - I'm surprised Cirdan made it this far, beating out Erestor and Amarthiul.  His 4 WP is great and access to Narya is also great.  I just don't see him played nearly as much as Elrond.  While Vilya is boring to me, Elrond's healing boost is a life saver, especially in 3-4 player games.

 

Gandalf vs Arwen - My hatred of Gandalf is well documented.  Arwen (either hero or ally version) seems to be in almost every game I play these days.

 

Galadriel vs Aragorn (T) - Two really fun heroes.  I'll go with Aragorn's supremely entertaining ability over Galadriel's tools.  The fact that Galadriel can't do any fighting or questing on her own has frustrated me enough times to tip the scales against her.

 

I find it interesting that we have 4 spirit heroes and only 1 of each other sphere (plus neutral).  And that is even without the ubiquitous Glorfindel.  Spirit simultaneously has some of the best heroes in the game and several of the worst (Fatty, Pippin, Oin, Dwalin).

## 123 [Slothgodfather on December 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2550432)

Yea, I was really surprised when I realized we had a Spirit hero in each pairing this round.  

 

Sam vs Eowyn (S) - Like I said previously, Eowyn all the way!

Cirdan vs Elrond - The card cycling and 4 WP are enough to push him above Elrond.  When I consider their tools - Vilya vs Nenya - I actually like Nenya more.  Sure, Vilya is strong, but I just don't care for the blind aspect without also requiring Gandalf to be present. 

Gandalf vs Arwen - this was easily the hardest vote for me.  Gandalf is easily one of my favorite heroes to play, but he really requires so many tools and such much dedicated deck space, where Arwen just works right out of the gate and is just better if you manage to draw Elven Light.   

Gladriel vs Aragorn (T) - Aragorn is a murder machine, but I've found Tactics can already murder things well without him.  Galadriel offers some interesting abilities and uses out of your allies, so she takes the pick.

## 124 [Calyx on December 19, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2550496)

It is because of people like Slothgodfather that we have 50% Spirit heroes left (well, also all of those heroes are really strong).

 

For me, this round of voting was by far the easiest - not a single difficult decision:

 

Sam vs Eowyn (S) - Obviously both of these heroes are quite strong, and Eowyn I think still retains the questing crown, though her hold has been getting more and more tenuous. Sam, however, brings strong willpower to Leadership, where he is fairly unique. I find myself using Sam far more often then Eowyn.

 

Cirdan vs Elrond - Like Teamjimby above, I am also surprised that Cirdan made it this far. Obviously he is a good hero, but I consider both Amarthiul and especially Erestor to have significantly greater impact on the game. Regardless, his unexpected rise has to end here. Elrond is just better. I love building Elrond decks, especially those without Vilya.

 

Gandalf vs Arwen - Gandalf shouldn't really be a hero, but since he is I built a deck with him one time. It was fun for the first 2-3 quests I used it on, so I built another one... which was almost exactly the same. No hero takes up more dedicated deck space than Gandalf, and that is what makes him boring - I'm not saying that you can't build differently with him, I'm just saying there is really no point. Arwen, on the other hand, opens up a huge deckbuilding space that has been really fun to explore.

 

Galadriel vs Aragorn (T) - Both of these heroes are quite fun and very powerful, despite being essentially diametric opposites. Galadriel helps any deck along in fairly subtle ways, while Aragorn... kills everything. I have to say that I enjoy building decks with Aragorn a lot more. Both heroes offer many possibilities and enable new strategies, but only Aragorn is generally the centerpiece of a deck.

 

If everyone votes as I have - and so far the heroes I have chosen are actually winning - we will get a final four representing one hero from each sphere, which would be fantastic. Hopefully Elrond will finally become the champion as he deserves, though I'm not sure how I would vote in an Elrond/Aragorn match up.

Sam Gamgee vs Éowyn (S)

I don't use any of these heroes very often... I never go mono-leadership, and when I think in including leadership (for stuff like Steward or Sneak attack+Gandalf), I think in access to resource generation, and thus I want to include guys like Denethor or Amarthiúl. When I think in spirit, I think in stuff like test of will, unexpected courage, threat reduction, etc... and although I'd rather prefer Arwen, Galadriel or Glorfindel over Éowyn, I like her more than Sam. I've considered using Éowyn for Caldara decks; I never consider Sam for any deck (I don't care about thematic decks btw)

 

Cirdan vs Elrond

I've been using Cirdan in a Caldara deck I recently built. He is definitely solid, and Narya is awesome... but Elrond is just better. Well, at least I like him more and I've had much more success with him. Vilya is just broken.

 

Gandalf vs Arwen

ugh, both these guys are top 5 heroes imo... the main issue with Gandalf is that you can't use his ally versions. Threat doesn't even matter with those stats, abilities and toys (Narya & Word of command!!). I agree with previous comments saying Gandalf requires decks running around him, meanwhile Arwen is much more versatile and adaptable. mmm honestly this is a tie for me. My choice is because I play solo, I play power decks, and I think Gandalf has a tiny advantage in that regard.

 

Galadriel vs Aragorn (T)

They are so different in what they offer and therefore is hard to establish comparison points. Galadriel is always an option when I build decks, and that's the main reason for my vote here. Consistent threat reduction is a hard thing to find even in today's meta.

Sam vs Eowyn: No contest, Sam is just a lot more interesting.  Eowyn is more universally useful, but Sam has a more significant impact on your gameplay and makes you walk that threat balancing line.

 

Cirdan vs Elrond: A close one for me as Elrond is a superbly useful hero and makes it into many of my decks, even though I almost never use Vilya.  Guy should be 15 threat with his abilities.  But unlike others, I am not surprised that Cirdan made it this far.  He is Bilbo Baggins for your deck in a multiplayer setting, even though you have to discard one of the cards you draw.  I run him without recursion all the time. 4 willpower is great, but this is a flexible hero, don't be fooled: he is a high priority target for Light of Valinor and has a "jack of all trades" statline outside of his 4 willpower, so you can use his stats even if you aren't running a Narya deck.  With Narya it's a whole different ballgame, as often I am conflicted and have some fun decision-making to do about which two allies to ready.  Always fun to defend with an ally, use Narya before the attack resolves, then have that ally ready to attack with +1 attack and able to resolve the attack with the +1 defense stat as well.

 

Gandalf vs. Arwen: Arwen is a great hero who solves the resource problem for many decks.  Pair her with tactics Aragorn and you've got a tactics resource engine who isn't Mablung (as long as you can fund her with cards).

 

Galadriel vs Aragorn: Go Aragorn! Take this one home!

This is how I feel.  The only reason I see needing splash Sam now is if someone else is already using Denethor.  The additional resources are far more valuable than what Sam can offer.  Sure, Sam could be utilized in a deck specifically designed around him, but as a splash hero, I don't see a regular use for him anymore.

Interesting - I often find myself splashing in Sam primarily for his willpower and threat, not his ability. Denethor certainly cuts into that somewhat, as he is basically Sam with Willpower and Defense switched plus a fantastic ability, but I still get good use out of both heroes.

 

It is a real shame that Denethor went up against Arwen fairly early - he deserved to go much farther, and I think would have but for luck of the bracket.

Denethor's resources typically offset the loss of willpower from not using Sam, so that's why I don't see a reason for Sam anymore (as a splash hero).  Denethor also provides significant benefits like being able to play Steward of Gondor on the first turn.

I agree that Denthor is very strong, and I'm not sure how I would vote in a match up between him and Sam. However, I do think you undervalue Sam. Denethor will always be making a solid contribution, and in the right deck his turn 1 resources can offset the willpower loss from not including Sam. However, sometimes you just need willpower on a hero - maybe your deck doesn't have a ton of allies, maybe your other heroes are low on willpower, maybe you just can't rely on luck of the draw for your turn 1 questing.  Sam does fit in some decks better than Denethor.

 

It is nice to finally have options for the leadership splashing hero, though. Also, my Sam-Denethor-Aragorn deck is amazing.

Matchup Spotlight!

 

Wisdom versus Beauty 

 

Gandalf versus Arwen

 

Gandalf.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Road-Darkens/Gandalf.jpg]Arwen-Und%C3%B3miel.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Dread-Realm/Arwen-Und%C3%B3miel.jpg]

 

I tracked Gandalf down in the midst of battle and pulled him off to the sidelines for a quick interview.  After he brushed what I can only assume to be the remains of burnt orc off his sleeves, I asked him to explain why he is a stronger hero than Arwen.

 

Gandalf: While it is true that Arwen is the fairest elf in all of Middle-Earth, I must remind the voting public of my many achievements:

-Prepared to stymie Sauron's attempts at world domination for 2000 years

-Successfully infiltrated Dol Guldur TWICE

-Put into motion the Quest for Erebor, a chain of events which removed Smaug from the Lonely Mountain 

-Discovered the treachery of Saruman and lived to tell the tale

-Mobilized the entire West against Sauron in the War of the Ring

-Slew a frickin' Balrog

-RETURNED TO LIFE

-Rescued the Ring-bearer after successful completion of his mission (as a courtesy, and with some help)

 

And against that list, I would compare the achievements and reason for fame of the lady Arwen:

-was born

-is hot

-made a banner

 

Lastly, I acknowledge that some call my play style "boring" for its sheer power, or because the Planning phase may take... a small bit longer than usual when I am around.  However, this is appropriately thematic because I am the planner to end all planners.  

 

-------------------

 

After speaking with Gandalf, I tracked down Arwen in a sitting room at the Last Homely House.  I asked her why she is a stronger hero than Gandalf.  Her answer:

 

Arwen: <editor's note: Arwen does not have speaking lines until after Sauron is overthrown>

 

 

 

So there you have it, folks.  Oh I should mention Arwen can give you resources!

Vote wisely!

## 137 [PocketWraith on December 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236181-the-hero-championship-2016/?do=findComment&comment=2553143)

Interestingly, this round wasn't actually that difficult for me.

 

Sam Gamgee vs. Éowyn

This was the most difficult choice. I love Sam, while Eowyn I can get a bit tired of since she has been in such a multitude of decks as the premier quester since the Core Set. On the other hand, well, she has been the premier quester since the Core Set. She is just that good. I have a lot of fun with Sam at times, but I could say that about almost any hero in the game.

 

Círdan the Shipwright vs. Elrond

I love Cirdan. I love his interesting status as the oldest elf in Middle Earth, the only elf we ever meet described as having a beard, his wisdom in giving Narya to Gandalf, and the interesting setting of the Grey Havens, of which he is obviously the representative. That's in story terms of course, in gameplay he's also very useful, though the main thing which stands out for me there is Narya - also a card I love, not least for the fact it's so much like the custom Narya I designed years ago. On the other hand, Elrond has Vilya; it's more powerful and also very interesting, sometimes for similar reasons (in fact those two rings can work quite well together). And then besides that there are Elrond's own innate abilities, which continue to demonstrate their incredible potency in making Elrond a very strong pick even in the absence of Vilya. The ability to bring in allies from other spheres lends great flexibility to a deck either in smoothing out resources between spheres or in allowing access to out of sphere allies - that this is very powerful should be much less of a surprise in the wake of the increased popularity of A Good Harvest. And then healing has obviously been gaining a lot more significance for a while as it has become that much easier in a lot of more recent quests to take damage one way or another. Elrond is just so all-round great and deserves recognition for that.

 

Gandalf vs. Arwen Undomiel

I fully accept that there are very strong arguments in favour of Arwen. I don't dispute those arguments. What I do continue to find very strange are the arguments against Gandalf - in particular the one brought up multiple times on this page, that he takes up a lot of dedicated deck space and is limited in what decks he works in. I think I may have said something to this effect a few pages back as well, but even if so, it bears repeating - if you build multiple decks with Gandalf and find them all the same, then you are doing something wrong. If you find Gandalf inflexible in what decks he can work in for reasons other than his threat cost, then you are doing something wrong. A little way up this post I talked up the incredible value of Elrond's ability to play out of sphere allies - Gandalf lets you play out of sphere everything. I don't see how you can see a hero with the ability to let you play literally any card in the game (barring other play restrictions) as anything other then incredibly versatile.

Part of this I think is a mistake in terms of perception of the hero. A lot of people don't build decks with Gandalf, they build Gandalf decks, and throw in all the Gandalf toys, which I'll grant you is a fair number of toys. But here's the thing - just because Gandalf has amazing stats and the highest threat cost of any hero in the game doesn't mean he needs to be the focus of your deck. If you look at his ability, it really doesn't support turning him into a powerhouse the way the abilities of heroes like Boromir or Treebeard do. His ability grants resource-smoothing and effective card draw. Look at his text box and Gandalf appears to be a support hero, and so in fact he is - albeit a support hero with amazing stats, 14 threat cost and a suite of toys to let him do fairly impressive things in his own right. As far as dedicated deck slots go, Wizard Pipe is hard to do without because it makes Gandalf's ability so much more reliable (though I think decks could be built which wouldn't need it); and Gandalf's Staff I would always include, but that's because the Staff is another support card which like Gandalf himself, just makes your (or someone else's) deck run more efficiently in the long run, by drawing cards or generating resources. Plus it can discard shadow cards if you have combat concerns. The other Gandalf toys are nice, but not actually required for a lot of decks.

As an illustration of my point about the potential variety Gandalf can offer, I searched through my own RingsDB decks for ones where I've used hero Gandalf - 5 different decks (some with multiple iterations), none of which devote that much deckspace to Gandalf, and all of which play rather differently:

Arwen is much-loved by the community, and rightfully so because she is amazing. There are entirely valid reasons to vote for her in this matchup or any other up to and potentially including the final, but to say that she's more versatile and adaptable, or opens up more deckbuilding space, than Gandalf, the hero who can do literally anything, is franky absurd.

 

Galadriel vs. Aragorn

Everything is better with Galadriel. I can't be bothered to make a more detailed argument at this point, and it'd probably be a rehash of an argument I've made before anyway.

Eowyn > Sam - The Hobbit lost his position as the best splashable leadership hero to denethor. He's not bad at all, but I think it is exaggerated "how" amazing he is. Eowyn might be very one dimensional in what she does, but she does it so incredibly well. Overall very close decison, but Sam lost more of his realtive power than Eowyn.

 

Elrond > Cirdan - As said before, I run Elrond in a ton of decks and he never ceases to amaze me.

 

Gandalf > Arwen - I want to use this space to emphasize what PocketWraith wrote about that matchup. 100% agreed

 

Aragorn (T) > Galadriel - Galadriel will probably be an Evergreen in this competition, as she provides so many Things Players want. Sadly she can't provide These amazing stories where you engaged and killed 4 enemies in a row, saved your teammades ass and got rid of some threat in the staging-area.

 

May it be the year of the high threat cost and shiny powerhouses, who finally deserve a win^^

Gandalf cannot do literally anything. Yes, he's powerful, and there are legitimate reasons to vote for him in any matchup he faces, including this one. But there is a reason Arwen has 16 pages of decks on ringsdb to Gandalf's 7, and it isn't all due to newness or the lack of people understanding Gandalf.

 

Gandalf has a threat cost of 14, and once you've chosen him as a hero you pretty much do have a "Gandalf Deck" whether you like or not, because you've signed yourself up for high-threat deck (or some 2-hero or hobbit deck). Now, there's a ton of space within those archetypes, but Arwen has a lot more breathing room for hero selection.

 

And if Gandalf's Staff/Pipe gets to be part of the discussion (which they should), then so does Elven-light. With Arwen it's essentially repeatable card draw and resource acceleration in Spirit, the two things they most struggled with.

 

I have discovered many new deck archetypes thanks to Arwen that never worked before, and didn't work with Gandalf. Sure, he can play any card in the game, but that doesn't automatically translate into deck versatility. And if that's the main reason you're including him, then he isn't worth the threat cost in my opinion. 

 

So yes, Arwen is more adaptable and versatile, and opens up more deckbuilding space than Gandalf, and that's why I voted for her.

Sam vs Elrond - Tough choice, but as a Hobbit player I decided to go with Sam.  Either way, I expect the winner of this match up to lose in the finals.

 

Arwen vs Aragorn (T) - Another tough one.  While Arwen is very powerful, she is powerful in a generic sort of way (resource and card advantage) that doesn't excite me.  She's the kind of card you use if your #1 goal is to win.  Aragorn unlocks a totally different play style that I find highly enjoyable.  He's the kind of card you use if your #1 goal is to have fun.  Also, I really like the Arwen ally and I'm sad that I can't reliably use her anymore.

In the first one, I couldn't decide between the two, so I applied the "nobody wins more than one time" policy and voted for Elrond.

The second one was even thougher. Both heroes are staples in their own archetypes and become sensational when built around them. I finally went with aragorn because Arwen does nothing you can't get with other heroes, while Aragorn does what only Aragorn can.

Really surprised (pleasantly) that Aragorn topped Galadriel. He's really good, but Arwen is great and flexible. I have pretty well stopped using hobbits over the course of the last year, so that's an obvious choice. Hoping for an Elrond Arwen showdown.

Elrond > Sam - There aren't a lot of new points to mention about any of these two. I obviously prefer Elrond

 

Aragorn (T) > Arwen - You can only vote for Aragorn. He can profit from Arwen's ability,  while Arwen can't really profit from his. That makes Aragorn clearly the supreme choice, right?

Matchup: The Tale of Aragorn and Arwen!

Arwen currently has a slight lead over Aragorn: 21 to 18 votes! Your vote matters!

Arwen-Und%C3%B3miel.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Dread-Realm/Arwen-Und%C3%B3miel.jpg] vs Aragorn.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Lost-Realm/Aragorn.jpg]

As these star-crossed lovers strolled through the vale of Imladris, we overheard their conversation....

Aragorn: ... and do you not know, that when you are in play, your ally cannot be? That is not without consequence.

Arwen: Last I looked, there were not one or two or three Aragorns, but FIVE with your Fellowship versions. When you are done starting your own boy band, you can talk to me about table conflicts.

Aragorn: A fair point. But I certainly am the most powerful of all of them. And I introduce what has long evaded Tactics: shenaniganry. At last you can build a 'tricky' deck which also is powerful, without relying on Hama and his dull recycling.

Arwen: Yes I agree. If you enjoy combat phases which last 15 minutes, and a hero who invites more "rewinding" of the game to obtain an optimal result than any other hero's ability in the game, then you are the hero to pick, and my lord Aragorn deserves the community's vote. If you prefer a simple but powerful effect, and a splashable hero who can fit into almost any deck, then... not.

Aragorn: The power of my supporting cards cannot be understated. Celebrian's Stone, Roheryn, Sword that was Broken... these artifacts elevate me to one of the most powerful heroes in all of Middle-Earth.

Arwen: If you valued Sword that was Broken as much as you say, perhaps you would treat it as Sword that was Kept Nicely in its Chest, rather than Sword that was Constantly Scattered About the House. And anyway, a willpower boost is not a desired boon for most Tactics players. You do have a nice horse, my dear. Now, if you but include Elven-light into any deck with me, you have the flexibility to use me as card draw or resource acceleration. I simply solve problems in an elegant and efficient manner.

Aragorn: Let us agree to disagree then, and let the community decide. However, when I am crowned king of all the West, this argument may end differently.

-----------

There you have it folks!

As a side note, Elrond and Sam are currently locked in a one-sided contest, and it looks like the Hobbit is on his way back to the Shire. Our contestants did send these messages:

Elrond: When I sent you off to die, small one, I did not expect you to return, only to challenge me. But worry not, soon you will be returned to your gardens.

Sam: Well Sam, you had a good run. You did your best. And you did win one of these before. It'll be nice for a bit of peace and quiet for a change.

These match-ups are tough as nails!! 

 

For me Elrond vs. Sam is relatively easy, Elrond it is. I am a flagrant Vilya abuser when it comes to deck building. 

 

But Aragorn versus Arwen!!! In the end I will have to go with Arwen. Tactigorn is extremely powerful, but you have to build around him. Arwen is great no matter where you put her; no matter what deck, what quest, how many players, etc. 

 

But I am so off to build a Aragorn (T) and Arwen deck now.

Elrond vs Arwen - Tough choice, although neither would be in my top 5, maybe not even top 10.  I'll go with Elrond because of his amazing effect in multiplayer games.  But if Arwen wins, this will cap a very impressive run.  She took down Denethor (Le), Legolas (T), Gandalf, and Aragorn (T), all of whom probably would have made it to the finals if they had Elrond's path (Erkenbrand, Aragorn (Lo), Cirdan, Sam).

 

Sam vs Aragorn (T) - These two pair together really nicely actually.  I love them both, but Aragorn is just so fun.

Father-daughter match-up! I am going for Arwen all the way. I am a solo player, so a Spirit, resource-generating, card draw enabling, quester who can also battle given some toys, that is almost too good to be true. I rarely play without her now.

I could say either one is a tough choice, but it would be a lie

 

Aragorn > Sam - Aragorn needs to be on the pedestral so he can party with his wife and father in law. Appart from that I think he is more fun to play with.

 

Elrond > Arwen - Both are fantastic, Arwen might be a little better solo, her dad in multiplayer, but in the end I feel Elronds deserves it more than Arwen. It's hard to explain why as most arguments for or against one of them more or less fit on the other as well, in the end I give it to Elrond for his life saver potential. Not only does he counter most formes of direct damage, but no matter what you lack (willpower, defense or a little attackpower) he can fill the gap (+all the Noldor tools that work on Arwen work on him too, admitted many are out of sphere for him until he has his Ring/song whatever). He also helps with ressources smoothing.

Of these four heroes, Aragorn is the only one that doesn't hit my table that often. I'm not sure why; he's fun to play and I really enjoy the Dunedain strategy, I guess I just end up using his other colors more often.

For the finals, my vote goes to Arwen. I like Elrond's ability to amplify healing, but it's hard to beat the versatility of a 9 cost hero with access to resource generation and card draw, the keys to consistency for any deck.

Elrond!

 

out of sphere allies? yes please.

free cards in play form your deck? hell yes.

amplified healing? I'm sold: Elrond ftw!

Elrond vs Arwen

 

Who needs resource acceleration when you can play cards for free? JRSRkLT.png [http://i.imgur.com/JRSRkLT.png]

(kinda simplistic, I know... tbh it's a really tough matchup. I'm fine with either of them winning. Elrond -and Vilya- is pretty unique though)

 

Sam vs Aragorn (T)

 

I never use Sam. I've used Tactics Aragorn in the past with success. I don't need further reasoning JRSRkLT.png [http://i.imgur.com/JRSRkLT.png]

Alright everyone. I think you know what time it is. Time to give Elrond the title he should have earned years ago!!
 

If he actually loses to Arwen it will be ridiculous. Yes she is shiny and new, yes she is amazing and yes she helps ramp resources and card draw big time but Elrond is just the ultimate hero and has been ever since his release. 

He boosts healing across the board just by being in play and you can massively take advantage of this with cards that allow healing across multiple characters or quests that have locations with beneficial effects such as across the ettenmoors (heal 1 from every character when you travel to one of the Safe locations) by healing an extra point across multiple characters at a time rather than just one. Something as simple as Galadrim Healer for example can heal a whopping 6 damage off your heroes instead of 3 just from Elrond's boost. 

He can pay for allies from ANY sphere. If that isn't one of the best resource smoothing abilities in the game I don't know what is. He can quest, defend and even attack so can fulfil a wide variety of roles. What does Arwen do? Quest quest and oh some more questing. Elrond with Vilya is insanely powerful and not only does it let you play cards for free but also gives Elrond the spirit sphere allowing him to pay for spirit events and attachments (he can already pay for spirit allies). He is a fantastic recipient for Burning Brand, Elven Mail, Gondorian Shield, Steward of Gondor considering he can pay for any allies) and countless other attachments and is even one of the best targets in the game for LoV.

Elrond has several powerful effects that are game changers in both solo and multiplayer. He goes the distance in almost every single aspect or regard and is an all round powerful hero that can be buffed with the vast majority of available attachments (Noble trait helps here). With Vilya he can even turn a mediocre deck into an extremely powerful one. A vote for Arwen in the finals is a vote for madness!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Voted for Arwen because I use her a lot more than Elrond, but I agree with PsychoRocka's assessment on relative strength. Either one are fantastic heroes.

Vilya is a gamble unless you are using Gandalf or Stargazer.  And I do agree it is powerful, but without one of those those two things, it is an unreliable mess - at least on paper.  I've not tried it out myself honestly.  

 

And sure, Elrond has a ton of other abilities and usefulness that makes him awesome.  He should, he's freaking Elrond!   But first turn Northern Trackers is one of my favorite things and you can't reliably get that anywhere else than Arwen (and pure Spirit).

Caldara gets you Northern tracker and another costly ally, reliably. Ideal situation: Put down Emery for free, discarding from your deck Glorfindel, Imrahil and Northern tracker. Sword-thain Emery, and sacrifice Caldara to put into play those three discarded allies. It gets easier with Cirdan / Arwen / Éowyn discarding. idk why Caldara didnt reach higher positions in this competition. The girl is gonna be crazy powerful as the card-pool grows

Caldara is already crazy powerful, but she basically only works in one deck.  For that reason I'd be surprised if she even makes it to the top 4.  Plus, just because something is powerful doesn't mean everyone will like it.

Oh Caldara can, but if you had terrible draw and all that was in your hand was 1 Northern Tracker, you aren't likely going to trigger Caldara for just the one. With Arwen, you just need any other card in your hand - which you'll have - and a Northern Tracker and you can get them down first turn.  I've actually let a friend use my Caldara deck before and for the fun of it I went through the experiment of what is the most optimal opening hand/next several cards, and it is indeed crazy powerful.

The thing about Arwen and Caldara is that the best sidekick for Caldara is... Arwen!

Arwen Elrond and a spirit hero can also play northern tracker first turn thanks to both Arwen and Elrond which means you don't have to go full spirit. just saying =)

You have 2 spirit heroes and Gríma. You attach Love of Tales to Gríma, then a Song of Travel, exhaust Love of Tales and gain a resource. Then use Gríma's ability to play the Northern Tracker for 3.

Hey guys, now that this competition is coming to an end, I'd like to do something similar: An Art-Appreciation contest. As it sounds, we'd vote for our favorite cards just based on illustration. I'd like to split it into several categories: Heroes, Allies, Attachments, Events, Side-Quests, Enemies, Locations, Treacheries, Quest cards. What do you think of this? Any ideas, suggestions, how to make it work, deadlines, configuration, seeding, etc?

You could field nominations for top 1, 2, or 3 choices in each category.  Then compile 10 choices per category based on those nominations, then run the tournament similar to how the hero championship is structured. You could field the nominations by posting a series of threads (1 for each category) in the Player Community subforum (so this one doesn't get flooded).  That's a lot of work for you, but that's the best I could come up with.

WOOOOOOOO! Finally Elrond wins a hero championship!!! 

Couldn't have hoped for a better outcome this year! 

Tactigorn deserved to go as far as he did as well (I actually think he deserves 2nd place more than Arwen).

Tactigorn is really, really good.  But Tactics didn't exactly have a shortage of ways to kill enemies, nor engage them.  Spirit lacked resource generation and card draw, something she fixes near single-handed (need Elven-Light).   Tactigorn is definitely more fun to use as a hero, but Arwen lets you do more with your deck.

I think Aragorn deserved the #1 spot.  I hadn't used Tactics since the Heirs of Numenor cycle because there was no reason to and I only used Tactics sparingly in the first two cycles for very specific quests.  Even without Arwen, Spirit was a perfectly fine sphere and it just got stronger because of her.

I guess it all depends on perspective and play-style - which is why the contest doesn't have any criteria for "best hero" in the first place.   I normally play 2-4 players, so typically at least 1 person includes a bunch of spirit for questing and someone else uses Tactics for combat.  In those scenarios, while Aragorn is never a bad option, he's somewhat unnecessary, and I find you are typically better off running an elf and gaining access to the best weapon suite available.
