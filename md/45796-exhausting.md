If a hero as an attachment that has an exhaust effect such as Steward of Gondor, does the item exhaust or does the character exhaust as well?  Also does this imply that attachments exhaust seperately than the heroes or characters they are attached too?

Steward of Gondor has text: Action: Exhaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to attached hero´s resource pool. So I don´t know what is the problem here.

Sorry I thought that since it is attached to a character that the character would also have to exhaust but I guess in this the item and the character are seperate things that you can exhaust.

It must to be written on that card, that you need exhaust attachment and hero. Otherwise you need to exhaust only the attachment. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]
