Hiya all :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I have one question about Eowyn action. Card says that if we discard one card we will get +1 willpower.

Can I discard 2 or 3 cards and get 2-3 willpower points or is it jus one point per discarded card per player ?

No you cannot. Eowyn says that you may discard 1 card from your hand. So you get 1 willpower. Her effect may trigger each player once each round. It means she gets max 2 willpower per round. Everything important is written on the card.

Or +4 willpower in a 4 player game.

Â Or + 7 billion in a global player game.
