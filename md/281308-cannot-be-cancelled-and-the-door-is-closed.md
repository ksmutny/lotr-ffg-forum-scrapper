I know that previous discussion exist on this topic.

I have read the seastan document where he said that the door is closed can cancel when revealed effect which contain cannot be cancelled. Is it official ?

I assume. It's only logical. TDiC cancels the entire card text (as the encounter card is revealed, so before it's in play and game text is active) and "cannot be cancelled" is part of that.
