I tend to get my APs from rpg shops on ebay, I have one or two who I buy from regularly. They nearly always get an AP a week after it is released in the US.

…but so far "The Drúadan Forest" has not appeared at all. Has anyone in the UK seen the current AP in a physical shop?

Thanks!

I can't say I have, though I haven't looked too hard.

I got my copy through the book depository on Friday for an excelent £8.01 (delivered), so it is here on our shores.

I ordered from the Book Depository via Amazon.co.uk, and it was delivered on Friday. I usually order from gameslore.com, but theres been no sign of Druadan Forest in upcoming releases there.

I did the same - not sure what has happened to gameslore.com. I also usually order from them, and hitherto they have always had TLOTR packs on sale very promptly.

I usually get mine from 13th floor, and there has been no sign yet either. I've looked at a few other online stores (no physical game shop for miles) and nothing there, either. Last I checked of amazon it was available for about £18 postage, plus the usual £12 for the pack. Hmph. I might check out book depository later, then...

 

Though I have yet to try The Steward's Fear, anyway...
