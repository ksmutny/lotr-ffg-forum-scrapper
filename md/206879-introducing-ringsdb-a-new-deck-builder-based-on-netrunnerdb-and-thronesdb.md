## 1 [Sydtrack on March 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206879-introducing-ringsdb-a-new-deck-builder-based-on-netrunnerdb-and-thronesdb/?do=findComment&comment=2126599)

I would like to introduce this amazing community to a new Deck Builder, based on NetrunnerDB and ThronesDB.

 

RingsDB - http://ringsdb.com [http://ringsdb.com]

 

It was released one week ago and community already shared 300 decklists.

 

Some of the features available:

 * Card Search, with multiple attributes (including card errata)
   
 * Fast and powerful deckbuilder
   
 * Pack selection (you select what packs you have and the deckbuilder will hint you about cards you have or not)
   
 * Private and Public decks (your choice)
   
 * Mobile friendly
   
 * Text import/export
   
 * OCTGN import/export
   
 * Card and Deck reviews and comments
   
 * Deck Sideboard (you can include cards you will swap depending on the quest)
   
 * Order cards by type or pack
   

There are other features available and others will follow. I'm open to all feedback and hope players like this new tool.

It looks promising. I need to give it some more time to really see its pros and cons. I want to do a video comparing each of the most common editors.

Love this new deck builder, already made and published my two handed decks on there.

Can't see where the sideboard feature is, I was looking for it for a little while but gave up, can you give me a hand locating it?

Thank you for using RingsDB. It really means a lot to me.

 

As for the Sideboard, since it is not very used, I tried to make it as unobtrusive as I could. The problem is that it is probably too hidden =(

When deckbuilding, just click in a card's name to open its popup window. From there you will be able to add them to sideboard.

I love it too. Very nice.

Just aquestion. After I publish a deck, isn't there a way I can edit it? I havetried but did not work

A published deck is a fixed version of a decklist. You can change the title or the description, but the decklist will be fixed. 

 

You can edit your private deck and republish it. It will get a new version number (2.0) after publishing again.

 

Although it is a bit weird this way, it was confusing to people when decklists were able to be changed (specially if they favorited or cloned it)

Is there a way to edit comments you make on a deck?  I don't see any option for that.

I want a way to "follow" deck authors. Then I can have a feed of all their activity (logged quest, new deck, updated deck, comment, like/favorite a deck, etc.)

I think it would be really cool. Of course, then we'd need privacy settings to be able to hide that activity if we want.

This is an upcoming feature, but it will take a while to get it working.

Ooh, that's the feature I've been waiting for. Once that's online, I'll probably move everything over to RingsDB.

Awesome. If I didn't already have too many side projects of my own, I would have loved to help out. Alas I'm barely keeping up with I already have on my plate, so I'll leave this all in your obviously-capable hands :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Edited March 31, 2016 by joezim007

I dunno if this is even doable, but I'd like to see something where you can either:

 

A) Build multiple decks at one time

or

B ) Have a setting where you can tell the deck builder to take into consideration cards in another decklist on your profile for purposes of them being used in your collection.

 

I think both of those sound confusing, so I'll try to give an example that makes a bit more sense of what Im hoping for.

 

My wife and I like to play 4 player (both of us using 2 decks). We've got all the packs and 3 Cores. So if I wanted to build a deck on ringsdb it would be nice to be able to have the site tell me Ive already got 3 copies of Daerun's Runes in another deck so I cant put it in this one cause I only have three or to say Ive already got 6 of 12 Core Gandalfs in decks.

 

Or just be able to build two lists at the same time in the same window. So I click into Deck 1 and add 3 Daerun's Runes. Im now using 3/3 of them. I click into Deck 2 and try to add Daerun's Runes, but I cant add more, cause its already at 3/3.

 

So like I said, I don't know if that's doable for programming, but does that at least make sense?

 

If this kind of thing is doable, then possible side-add: Some way to indicate to the joint-deck builder that you own 2+ copies of a single pack/box aside from a Core?

 

Thanks for all the hard work. This site is awesome!

Ok, lets round up some ideas to get some feedback:

 

In RingsDB there are private and public decks. They are different entities, the first is mutable and the second immutable.

I am developing the Fellowships feature. A Fellowship is a link between decks that work well together or are meant to be played together.

 

When creating a fellowship, you can select any of your own private or public decks. Also, to increase the social aspect of RingsDB, you will be able to select other people's private (if they enable "share my decks" in profile settings) or public decks.

 

If you select another player's private deck, a copy of their deck will be added to your own collection, allowing the deck owner to make changes to their version of the deck (or delete it) without affecting your Fellowship.

Public decks won't be copied because they are immutable.

 

A fellowship is private when first created. You can then publish it. When publishing a fellowship, every private deck in it will also be published.

This way, public Fellowships always contains public decks. Private Fellowships can contain both public and private decks.

 

When logging a quest, you can start by selecting a fellowship or individual decks. The quest log screen will show up to 4 selected decks.

Even if you started by selecting a fellowship, you will be able to add or remove decks, but since the group itself was changed, this log will not be linked to the selected fellowship.

 

For each selected deck you can do some card swapping, adding or removing cards that better suit the quest.  Red exclamation marks will warn you about repeated unique cards between multiple decks. Yellow exclamation marks will warn you if the total number of copies across all selected decks are over your card collection limit. This will allow some in place changes to fix it.

 

You will then log the quest, it's result, score and notes.

 

If you view any of the previously selected decks, you will see the quest result and what changes were made to the deck.

If you go to the fellowships page, you will see every quest result that was logged using exactly the fellowship decks (even with card modifications and even if you did not select the fellowship before questing).

 

-----------------------

 

When logging a quest you will be able to mark it as public, allowing other players to see your result when they view the deck or quest pages. 

 

Some problems I'm facing:

 * What to do with private decks used in a quest when the quest is marked as public?
   
 * What should I do to incentive players to select their decks and make card changes before playing the quest? The exclamation marks is a good feature to cross check the decks, but it is useless if players try to log a quest after they have played it.
   

 

I hope to get some feedback that will allow RingsDB to get even better.

The following part of my previous post is almost what you need. You won't be able to see these limitations while deckbuilding, but at least you will be warned if you select the decks before going to the quest and a in-place deck builder will aid you in fixing these cards.

Thanks thanks thanks thanks......

I'd like to add one thing:

How about something like 'personal valoration'? And it has 10 stars, you own press on the star you consider is your deck inside your deck list, valoration, etc.

For example, if i think this is one of the most best deck, i press on 10 starts. If i consider it is good, but not so much, 7, for example...

I think mndela means "Personal Valuation". So you can publish a deck that you think is pretty bad and rate it 2/10, that way people don't get mad at you when they try it out :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]. Interesting idea mndela!

A feature that would be cool is the ability to classify decks for solo or multiplayer, making a more specific search for decks.

I'm so happy this exists, and I like the feature set. I just can't make myself like cardgamedb, for multiple reasons. The generic deckbuilder that isn't suitable for any particular game is the least problem. ThronesDB, NetrunnerDB and RingsDB all make me smile when I poke around.

RingsDB now supports Fellowships. Feel free to test and send me some feedback!

Absolutely love the fellowship feature! So cool that you can link decks together especially for someone who plays two handed which means my two decks essentially ARE one deck. I really love that you included the various symbols for attack, defense, the spheres, hitpoints etc in the text editor!

 

Just created a fellowship for my decks along with a detailed explanation of the decks and how they work:

You know what one of my favorite things is about RingsDB? It's mobile-friendly! There are a few rough edges, but it's by far the easiest deck builder to use on a phone. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I was planning on doing a video that compared all of the main deck builders out there, but at this point, I don't see a good reason to. This has become the de facto deck builder and word is spreading quickly. You've done an amazing job and continue to do so. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

While creating a new deck I noticed a possible bug.  I originally created the deck with tactics-spirit-lore, then edited it and swapped out the spirit hero for a leadership hero (plus assorted card changes).  But the "My Decks" screen still shows tactics-spirit-lore under the title.

Hey Sydtrack,

 

 

I am new to your deckbuilder and I want to share some thoughts. First of all; I like that style of the pages and all the extra functions. It seems that your site is skyrocketing all other deckbuilders. Congratualtions! But I think (at least the deckbuilder itself) is not so intuitive to use as cardgamedb.com. I mean, for a quick research it is easier to click a few buttons than typing a line of text. Well, or I have to get used to it.. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Anyways, I do have some suggestions for (minor) improvements to make.

Do you mind adding a "do not include certain cards" in the search for decks? That would be very helpful when needing a deck for group play!

As I have to use the "Filter Help" quite often, it would be good if that popup yould not be hovering above the card list, so I had the option lo have it displayed all the time.

HavingHis is more an advanced thing: having a button to hide "impossible cards" - e.g. having no dwarf in the deck, then not showing the Dwarowdwelf Axe in the search results.

And last but not least "k:Noldor|Noble" works but "k:Ranger&Noble" does not. This would be also a nice feature.

 

Maybe that all is allready implemented and I just do not see these things... in that case ... my appologies.

 

Thank you in advance for considering my ideas.

There's an implicit '&' between each search term, so "k:Ranger k:Noble" seems to work fine.

That's exactly the opposite of what I think. I can't stomach the one on cardgamedb.com, and it's so much faster to use ThronesDB (plus being able to select so easily how many cores and expansions to use is a plus).

Yea. Card Game DB annoys me when you have to go back and forth between the card list and the filters. Getting used to RingsDB's filtering by text patterns can take some getting used to, but it's ultimately more powerful and for anyone who likes to use the keyboard more than the mouse, it's faster too.

I have been going into the Decklist section, then Search, then typing the name of a card to see what decks are using or even showcasing seldom-used cards.  I would also like to see an option to do a regular card search, then when you get to the card details you can click a button to pull up search results for decks that use that card.  (That is how I tried to find decks that used particular cards initially, took me some looking around to find what I was actually looking for)

Great idea! I just updated RingsDB to include it, please test and message me if any problem arises.

> I'm just curious, what is the criteria for the 4 decks that are shown on the front page?

 

The top deck by predominant sphere ranked by popularity.

 

The predominant sphere for a deck is selected by simple counting the number of cards from each sphere and taking the higher one.

 

Popularity is based on number of likes divided by the square of the time since publishing.

Another good idea for a feature would be having the option to list decks as solo, co-op questing, or co-op combat...and then make it searchable.

I'm constantly looking for decks designed specifically for those qualities (i.e. I have a good combat deck, would like to look at a list of questing decks to select a pair...that type of thing).

Can you maybe add another slot to choose a second trait in card search?

For example right now i can only select one trait, but if i wanted to find a card with Gondor and Ranger traits i can only search 1 trait. So if i wanted to build a thematic deck with Rangers of Ithilien and i use the Ranger option, then i would also get Dunedain Rangers as well. 

Not really necessary, just kind of annoying when theres a mix of cards that you want and dont want.

You can do this today [http://ringsdb.com/find?q=k%3Aranger+k%3Agondor], actually, just by including both traits seperately: "k:gondor k:ranger"

I wish we had a system of traits for decks. This could be an option that the builder selects like "monolore", "solo", "questing", etc.

To then be able to search decks with these criteria would be amazing. It would just require users to update their old decks already published.

The one thing I haven't seen anywhere yet is being able to search deck by function or archetype.

Can't wait to log quests on ringsdb.... 

I bet it will be way more intuitive and probably even have more options than the official quest log... (which still doesn't include Grey Havens.....)

 

From the preview we saw from Sydtrack, the very fact you can attach a fellowship instead of just one deck to a logged quest is absolutely amazing. For anyone except solo players the official quest log kind of completely sucks because of this so ringsdb will have this massive advantage right off the bat by the sound of things.

New player here. Are the enemy cards listed anywhere on the website? It would be cool to be able to see the scans of the enemy cards to. Also, does it show anywhere how many of each card are in the set? So far I only have 1 core set and it doesn't come with three of everything. Other than that it seems like a really cool website!

You can actually set it up so that your owned cards include only 1 copy of the Core set.  When you are building a deck, it would only give you the option to put 1 or 2 Steward of Gondor in your deck since it knows you only have 1 Core set.

There are still one or two cards per sphere that only appear once per Core set, so it'll still matter a little.

I recently started on it and discovered this last night.

 

"Man, why do I have to go through and click for which sets I want to filter each time. There's got to be an easier way."

 

*clicks around*

 

"Oh....there is."

 

"Well, that's really nice." 

 

Great site.

It would be interesting to have a way to tell if a deck is exactly the same as another. Just to add the "number of unique decks" number to the stats, and to urge people to think in new ways :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

It's easy, but resource-intensive to do. You may not want to go down that path :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

RingsDB will warn if you try to publish an exact copy of another published deck. Also, a link "duplicate of" will show at the top of the decklist page.

 

Example here: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/198/reaches-of-the-realm-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/198/reaches-of-the-realm-1.0]

Could be a tool that compares decks, and show the most similar decks. Not with the exact decks, could be much better by percentatge 90%, 80% of same cards, for example

It would be great if players could categorise their decks as thematic and non-thematic, maybe add a "funny" or "experimental" caregory as well.

I love ringsdb by the way, great work.

If you select edit for a fellowship, you can remove and add decks.

Mmm .. when i publish a fellowship it seems fixed.  No remove/add decks possible.

You're right -- editing a fellowship acts differently after a version is published, not allowing altering the decks (only the description).  How odd.  Perhaps it is a bug or oversight, I can't imagine why that would be desirable.  There's also no "clone" button.

 

While creating a fellowship from scratch would be very, very quick, it'd be nice to have the same options for a fellowship whether it's been published or not.

> You're right -- editing a fellowship acts differently after a version is published, not allowing altering the decks (only the description).

This is exactly the same as the fact you can't alter the cards in a deck once it's published (only the description). I don't see what's odd about it at all.

It's not exactly the same.  If I look at "Decks" under the "My collection" tab, the published decks have versions 1.1 through 1.19 (I haven't published any decks twice), and the unpublished decks run 0.1 through 0.11 -- and I can edit every last one of them to my heart's content.  Of course I can't change the contents of the *published version* of the deck (1.0), but I can certainly still edit the deck.

 

If I look at "Fellowships" under the "My collection" tab, the unpublished fellowships I can edit to my hearts contents -- adding decks, deleting decks.  But the published fellowships are all permanently fixed except for text, I don't have the option to change the fellowship to work with a different deck.  I can add Interrogation and Entangling Nets to my "Traps with Dunedain Support" deck and publish version 2.0, but I can't change my "Dori, Traps, and Rangers" fellowship to use the new traps deck with the old Dunedain deck, let alone republish it using the latest and greatest.

i agree. I wish there were some kind of "share" possibility which is only a link for my friends, so they can have a look at my current deck. And if i edit this deck .. my friends should be able to see this edits without generating a new link.

 

And what about published decks.. do they "grow" with my edits? must i publish a new version? can i delete my published decks without deleting the private one?

## 107 [dalestephenson on November 7, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206879-introducing-ringsdb-a-new-deck-builder-based-on-netrunnerdb-and-thronesdb/?do=findComment&comment=2492194)

If you have the "Share decks" enabled in your profile, you can give a link to your current deck.  Because I have that checked, I can provide a link to the latest (unpublished) version of my first deck and have others able to view it:

 

http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/5246 [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/5246]

 

But only the published version would show up in a decklist search, and the URL to it is different:

 

http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1022/descendant-of-beorn-s-path-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/1022/descendant-of-beorn-s-path-1.0]

 

I assume (but haven't tried it) that I could delete my published version without deleting my private version, and vice versa.  But my assumption could be wrong.  However, I certainly cannot edit the published deck, it is what it is.  I *can* publish my private deck again, creating a 2.0 version, at which point my private deck would become 2.1.

Might there be a way to shuffle drawn cards back into your deck when using the test feature?  I haven't figured out how to if there is a way.

When building a deck, I have always had trouble with the "cost" filter.  I will go in and type o:2 to see cost 2 cards, but nothing happens.  o<3 for cards under cost 3 works OK.  Seems to be just the o:<number> filter specifically. Does anyone else have problems with this filter?  Other filters like w for willpower, x for text, and k for trait work fine.
