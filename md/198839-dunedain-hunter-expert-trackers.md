Dunedain Hunter reveals an enemy and has you "put it into play engaged with you".

 

Does this effect fulfill the requirement for Expert Tracker's Response "After you engage an enemy..."

 

Using one immediately after the other, have you actually engaged the enemy or has the hunted enemy skipped the actual engagement action step? Should the card read "Engage that enemy"?

 

Similarly do enemy 'To engage...' effects occur when using the Hunter?

 

Thanks

I believe that "After you engage an enemy" triggers occur at any moment where a card moves from the state "not engaged with you" to "engaged with you". So, I think yes, it triggers those effects.

I red somewhere in the forum that an enemy has engaged you when it is physicaly moved in front of you.

This counts as engagement.  That's why the Dunedain Hunter is so nice in engagement decks -- if you play this guy you get to ready Sam, give Mablung a resource, and draw a card with Pippin!

 

The only type of engagement that does not trigger engagement effects is when a monster remains in the staging area but is "considered to be engaged" with you, like Thaurdir or the Watcher in the Water.

Thanks, needed reassurance that I wasn't cheating.
