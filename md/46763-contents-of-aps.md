I was hoping someone with LCG experience could give me a better idea of what is in an Adventure Pack. The product description says 60 cards, but I would imagine that it would be somewhere around 30 new cards in various multiples since heroes, quests, and some encounter cards would be onesies or twosies. I guess the question would be, do you think the player cards are all 3-ofs? Or will we have to buy multiples packs of certain APs? I have 2 Hunt For Gollum on preorder, but I don't know if that was shrewd or a waste.

I'm pretty sure these Adventure Packs have three copies each of 9 player cards, 1 Hero, and the Event and Quest cards for the scenario.  You don't need two copies of the Adventure Packs!

Good to know. I wasn't sure if there'd be a power "rare" with a single copy in an AP like in the Core set.

Thanks.

All of the packs for the other LCG's are 20 cards, 3 copies of each. I collect 3 out of 4 of them. But with LOTR looks like it will be a bit different as there will only be 1 copy of the new hero and 1 copy of the quest cards. 3 of everything else for the players, encounter cards will be a mix of 1,2,3 copies I would assume.

On the up-side, you never need more than 1 copy of a Hero or Quest-line.

I hope you are off on your numbers.  9 new cards, at x3 each, is only 27 cards of the 60 in the pack, add the hero and you're only up to 28 cards for "the player".  That would mean 32 cards of each set would be dedicated to the quest.  That's way too many for my taste and would be a major turn off.  I assumed they would be making extensive use of the existing encounter cards so that they don't have to print so many for each chapter pack.  If there are significant numbers of player cards in each set I would certainly buy mutlitple packs, just so I can build multiple decks without card swapping.  But I'm not buying multiple packs for only 9 different cards (27 in total). 

I'm already unhappy that I ended up with so many unuseable cards when I bought my three core sets (so many encounter cards I'll never use), if the same holds true for the adventure packs, it will limit the amount of money I am willing to spend on this game.  You would think that more player cards = more packs bought since there are probably a lot of people like me who want the extra cards so that they can build several decks. 

I guess we'll see, but I was hoping for more like 13-15 new player cards.  I would buy multiple copies of each adventure pack with that many new cards.

Unfortunately that is what they have said in their previews thus far, so it looks like more than half of the pack is going to be quest cards. I agree it is a turnoff...hopefully after this first wave of packs they change that format up a bit. They have said they want every adventure to be playable with just the core set + that pack, but that would really be missing an opportunity to combine different quest cards from different core packs. Anyways, with only 2 new cards for each sphere per pack, it's going to be quite some time before we see any real deck variety.

Ironically, I'd be happier if they didn't have 3x cards per pack at this point so that it would allow more variety, but it is what it is.

It is pretty possible that out of 28-30 encounter cards, some will enhance core encounter decks. I hope so.

Ditto to what Koz said. I'm a pretty serious gamer and I like to buy lots of core sets so I can build a dozen different decks without swapping cards. I have mixed feelings on only seeing 9 new free peoples cards per AP. It does seem to make for a slow development of the game. That's a little frustrating after waiting so long for it. On the other hand, I get to "savor the flavor" and enjoy knowing that Fantasy Flight won't burn the game out in 4 months because they released hundreds of new cards and ran out of ideas (or got victimized by inadequate playtesting and broke their own game).

It is what it is and I'll deal with it. So will we all, for the most part. I'm just glad the game is here. The solo aspect, co-op mechanics, and amazing art help make this game well worth its $168 (Miniature Market x6 core sets) cost. Definitely a modest price when compared to Decipher prices on LOTR: TCG. That would barely buy me 2 booster boxes online back in the day.

I do seem to be accumulating lots of extra encounter deck cards though....

Wow. You bought 6 core sets? Must be for 2 playsets of the onesies, but that's still a lot of extra cards. I agree with you on the investment value though. For $168, I could get roughly 3 booster boxes of my old CCG off ebay.

The German translator mentioned AP's contained up to five copies of one encounter card.

While the first AP 'only' contains 9x3 player cards, FFG may well decide to use a different ratio in their second AP cycle. For the moment I'm fine with this.

I think it would be interesting to have 2 AP's per cycle (or something) have just player cards, once there is a fairly large established base of quests. That way you could do something like:

1 - 2: 9 player cards per set, 1 quest

3: 18 player cards per set.

4: 9 player cards per set, 1 quest.

5: 18 player cards per set.

6: "Finale", 9 player cards per set, 1 quest.

Then, once per year as is normal, they have a 'deluxe set' that would have a lot more player cards and maybe a larger quest. That would give us around 50 new cards per sphere per year, depending on how the deluxe sets are laid out.

Anyways, we'll just have to see what they decide to do I suppose. Personally I think 7 quests a year is plenty, plus they will almost certainly come out with quests online combining the cards from different packs.
