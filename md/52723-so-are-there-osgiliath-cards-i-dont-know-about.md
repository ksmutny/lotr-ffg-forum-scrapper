 I keep seeing the name "Osgiliath" pop up in certain posts; I know nothing about this set, quest, cards or anything. Any help here guys?

Here's the spoiler list. There is one somewhere with card pictures but I seem to have misplaced the link.

I have the whole scenario up at LotrLCG.com [http://lotrlcg.com/searchBox.php?terms=&Type=1&Sphere=1&Expsn=1&Sort=1&Sort_AD=1&Then_Sort=1&Then_Sort_AD=1&radio=All&Scenario=11&Encounter_Set=1]. It was a given out to attendees at GenCon, and FFG will be releasing it as Print on Demand, meaning we will be able to order for around $5-$10.

 Dang, that looks challenging.

I use play this quest many times.Just print the proxy put in the sleeves and go on. But i wont to buy the set when is come out anyway.

For now for me is the best one!!!! Is really challenge!!! You start with 3 enemies on the staging area  from the first round. And more you progress more dangerous struggle you meet. And the last stage of the quest is Hell!!!!

I will probably pick it up when FFG decides to release it as POD. The cards look awesome and printing out on my inkjet just wouldn't do it justice.

I wonder why this scenario was released as a promo rather than another expansion pack? Too hard?

I doubt they wanted to come in from the off with uber hard quests. They gave this out to attendees of gen con because they knew the people there would likely be fairly hardcore and ready for the challenge.

What do you mean by "Print on Demand?"

FFG print them themselves, not a factory in china. That's the difference..

Man, I want this! Anyone else checking the Print on Demand section every hour every day? >_<

So, the quality will be much better. 

I was at Gen Con and FFG limited how many players could qualify for the Osgiliath Encounter Pile freebie. If you purchased a Generic ticket for a play session, you did not get the Osgiliath Encounter Pile.  It cost $2.00 to participate in any play session.  But, you needed a pre-paid session ticket for  a specific session to get the Osgiliath Encounter Pile freebie.  I don't know about Thursday, but Friday and Saturday when I tried to sign-up, I could only get Generic tickets.

When I asked the FFG representative at gen Con about buying a set. he said one month and it would be available. That's now.
