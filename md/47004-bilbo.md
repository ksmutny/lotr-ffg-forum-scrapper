# [Bilbo](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/)

## 1 [Mestrahd on May 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=470961)

I'm planning on using a house-rule that Bilbo costs 6 threat, in accordance with the other 13 heroes that have been released/previewed. I've read many arguments about him being a strictly worse Beravor, which is definitely true at a cost of 9, but I think that at a cost of 6, he compares favorably. With the new cost, your starting threat for Lore is below 30 which is awesome and you get his benefits. Once I get my hands on him, I'll try replacing Beravor with Bilbo at 6 in my Lore deck and see how it goes. Obviously, if I were in a tournament I'd have to play him as printed, but what do you think? Is anyone else going to try this?

 I bet his threat is lower when released actually

## 3 [BoundForGlory on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471018)

He should cost 6.  MAYBE you could convince me of a 7 in a 1-player game, since he effectively doubles your draw for no cost.  But anything above 7 doesn't make sense to me.

## 4 [sWhiteboy on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471037)

I have to be honest.  Bilbo is a great card, even for 9 threat (in a solo game).  The 3 threat isn't that huge of a deal considering the extra draw (and if you've played card games before, then you know that draw=win).

## 5 [gone questing on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471044)

I agree with sWhiteboy and Bryon's sentiments... wait and see, and card draw wins games!

My brother and I had a slight chuckle when we read (on other posts) that other players aren't using Lorien's Wealth, or didn't rate it highly.
FYI, the ST:CCG had virtually the same card as Lorien's Wealth (named Kivas Fajo - Collector) and we decided not to use it back in '95 because we could already draw cards at the end of the turn and it had a cost... we were kids :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
Once we started going to tournaments and seeing decks online, it was quite possibly the hottest card and was definately the most underestimated card by us!



I think 9 threat is too much for Bilbo.
It's 50% more than others have received... would you play Beravor with 15 threat?

## 6 [Narsil0420 on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471053)

 As has been said already, many times, there may be some other advantages (involving other cards, like a certain ring perhaps...) that Bilbo has that we don't know about yet. Don't jump the gun...

yeah, I agree... wait and see how Bilbo relates to the other cards in the set, etc.... looking forward to giving lore more options!!!

Totally agree. Well, I am not an expert yet but I have seen some of the game and although his ability is awesome it is not 3 Threat points more awesome than others - just take Legolas, for instance.

And I do hope it changes when it is released.

I like the formula for counting heroes' threat level and I'd like it to be kept.

## 9 [lleimmoen on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471100)

Reading the other posts, yes, there may (and probably will) be more to Bilbo than meets the eye (right now). However, for the sake of uniformity, I'd like him Threat 6 nonetheless - and I am by no means a fascist or necrophile (maybe just a fool).

## 10 [servant of the secret fire on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471103)

Bilbo is too good to have only 6 threat.Bilbo's abilitie is free.You don't need to exhauste him or to pay.You just draw an extra card for free.If you use Beravor you must exhauste her to draw 2 cards and if you don't use spirit in your deck(unexpected courage) then you have a less hero for quest/attack/defence.

If Bilbo's cost is 6 then you can have 28 starting threat with Beravor and  Glorfindel and a free extra card.Sorry but this is too good to be true.

## 11 [BoundForGlory on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471265)

Besides the free draw, what are you going to use Bilbo for?

He can't be used to defend, with only 2 hit points.

He can't be used to quest, since his 1 willpower is too little to risk the auto-wound Treachery cards (since he has such little hit points).

I suppose you could use him to add a tiny bit to another character's attack, but I'd rather drop a 2 cost ally with 2 attack strength for that.

So, he's mainly just there to draw a card.  I suppose if your deck is loaded with low-cost cards, that would be OK.  Or perhaps paired with Eowyn and/or other cards that allow a discard for effect.

But the way I build decks, I'd rather have someone with just a little more body for that much starting threat.

Besides attacking what else you are doing with Legolas now?His willpower is the same as Bilbo's.His defence is worst than Bilbo's and only his hit points are higher than Bilbo's but with protector of Lorien Bilbo can easy defend himself and you have your extra free card every round.

Also those extra things are only with Bilbo in the game.We don't know if Bilbo will have his sting or his Mithril coat and what abilities those possesions will have.We can only wait for the AP and then we can say if Bilbo is  good hero or not.

## 13 [Dam the Man on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471294)

I do kinda see Bryon's point. Having Bilbo in the game, having effectively 2 Heroes with third just sorta around for his ability does seem weak. Legolas, while he can't quest any better than Bilbo, has a huge upside in combat. Not only can he take an undefended attack damage from most enemies, when he attacks, he usually gives you progress tokens and with his Ranged, he can attack Enemies engaged to another player. I'm still twiddling with the starter decks but no way I'm even thinking of swapping out Beravor for Bilbo, let alone Denethor or Glorfindel.

If I can avoid it, I don't want my Heroes defending, Allies are there to die for that. Only exception I might make is Denethor with Protector of Lorien, 4 Defense kicks ass, but then, why would I want Bilbo when I could have Denethor and/or Beravor. Even if you have to exhaust Beravor, she can still contribute by taking undefended damage from some enemies, something Bilbo  categorically cannot do (at least not take and survive).

Also, Servant, you do think they would make Hero-specific Attachments? Meaning that unless you use Hero X, you can't use Attachment Y. I for one am not seeing FFG going that route. Attachment for a specific Sphere, maybe even a keyword (Dwarf), but not single Hero-specifics. Even if they give Sting/Mithril Coat extra bonus (like Dwarven Axe on a Dwarf), they should also apply to Frodo at least (Frodo's been spoiled).

I realy don't know mate but i hope so.I realy want to see in this game some unique artifacts/weapons like Anduril,Sting,Glamdring etc..We already have Celebrian's stone for Aragorn and maybe FFG will give us some more unique artifacts.

I do like the current approach, where Celebrian's Stone does its big thing (+2 WP) for anyone, but gives something extra for Aragorn (even if currently I don't have any use for Aragorn with Spirit icon). Even if Legolas with Blade of Gondolin making Ranged attacks does make me chuckle (Boomerang of Gondolin gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] ) everytime I use him.

What SOTSF said, heroes that have an ability that does not require exhausting that provides a significant advantage should cost more then the sum of the parts like the other heroes.  At 6, Bilbo would be seriously undercosted, 9 might be a little high, but really, gettting an extra card while still having an exhaust available is a tremendous advantage.  Obviously, Bilbo's value decreases with more players, so depending on where they landed with the actual value, 9 is probably still a very good value in solitaire mode, a very poor value in 3-4 players, and just ok in 2 player, if lower, it would be hard to pass up in solitaire (my opinion only).

In the other LCGs, with respect to the character specific attachments, there is a small bonus for everyone, but the specified character gets something better.  I'm assuming this game will follow that trend.

## 18 [BoundForGlory on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471425)

That is a good point about having the exhaust left on Bilbo, but what are you going to use Bilbo's exhaust to do?

Questing is too dangerous, since he has such little HP and the Treachery card that wounds all exhausted characters could be brutal against him.

Defending is too dangerous, since a +1 shadow card allows a 3 strength enemy to kill Bilbo.

Attacking is all there is left, and his attack value is only a 1.  Hardly worth it.

As I said before, he'd probably be balanced at a 7.  Actually, I think I am less concerned about his high cost as I am about his low HP.  If he were the same cost and strengths, but had even 1 more HP, that might be OK.  That way I could at least use him to defend.

There better be some really great stuff for Hobbits coming, or I'm afraid Bilbo's nickname is going to be Binder.

 

## 19 [sWhiteboy on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471428)

Well, if there is some Hobbit equipment coming, then it might take the entire cycle before you get everything that makes a hobbit good.  Since the 6 packs in each cycle are technically a "set," the cards aren't always useful until you have the entire set available.

With the cards we have now i can only imagine that you can use protecor of Lorien on Bilbo for an extra defence/wp if you play only lore and use him to defend weak monsters.If you use him in a dual sphere deck citadel plate from tacticks,Celebrian's stone from leadership and favor of the lady from spirit can boost Bilbo's stats and you can use him for some more things except the free card every round.

But honestly i must wait and see what other cards the AP will have to help Bilbo (if there will be any) and then i can say  if Bilbo deserves a spot in your deck.

Dam@

Yea it is kinda weird that Legolas can use the extra attack and progress wen he use his range abilitie with a melee weapon sorpresa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sorpresa.gif].Bow of the Galadrim or just a bow (cause Galadriel gave bow of the Galadrim to Legolas after Moria) fits better.

## 22 [Mestrahd on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471454)

If you think Bilbo should be a 9 because he doesn't exhaust then Eowyn and Gloin should be 12. They're both vastly better than Bilbo and don't need to be exhausted to use their ability. As others have pointed out, Bilbo is only good for 1 extra attack point, because any other exhaustion is too dangerous for his frame. Granted, there may be a Hobbit only attachment that is godly, but I still don't think that justifies the cost. Frodo follows the formula and he's arguably better than Bilbo. Yes, Bilbo rocks the solitaire, but even going to 2 players which is where I'd use him, he slides down the hotness scale.

But if you have to use all those cards to boost Bilbo, just how much better would another character be with those same attachments?

Neither ability comes near the power of drawing an extra card (with a one-time cost of 3 threat) EVERY TURN.

Eowyn's ability has the cost of discarding one card.  That's the exact opposite of drawing a card.  So, if drawing is "win", then discarding is "lose" (except in certain situations).

Gloin's ability is amazing, but it requires him to take damage.  The damage can be healed, but that uses up resources (which is counterproductive to the ability) and you have the opportunity cost of 1, or more, cards.  For example, Citadel Plate gives him 4 hit-points (which means 4 more resources), but it also costs 4 resources.  For every Lore of Imladris used on Gloin, you produce a gain of 1 Resource (only if you've already taken 3 damage).  Your best option for resource gain, when using Gloin, is either Daughter of the Nimrodel or Self Preservation.  Even still, it takes time to produce a gain in resources, and you have to draw the necessary card(s).

## 25 [BoundForGlory on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471474)

 I guess if enough GOOD lore cards with cheap costs get made, then the extra drawing will be really useful.  But right now, my Lore decks usually need resources more than they need cards.

Yes those attachments works better on other characters like Celebrian's stone on Aragorn and citadel plate on Gimli but you can sacrifice one of those attachments on Bilbo cause one free extra card every turn is a big plus especialy in decks which they don't use Beravor or lore sphere.

Before i got my box i thought that Bilbo is a bad hero but now after many games i can see that with the cards we have now and minimum 50 cards decks an extra free card every new round can save your game.Beravor with unexpected courage is ofcourse better but if you don't use spirit you will exhauste Beravor for her abilitie very few times especialy at the second scenario where you need as much wp as you can from your characters to pass the 2b quest card.

I can agree with you that Bilbo's stats force you to keep an eye on him and be careful all the time but i don't think that they will let Bilbo with out a card which can protect him or give him a boost.Somethink like sting or a hobbit sword or maybe a ring..? can do the jobgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

Dam already mentioned that the same attachments necessary to make Bilbo into a solid defender could instead be otherwise used to make certain other characters virtually indestructible, but I think it's important to remember too that since Bilbo's HP is so low, the likelihood of you having to rely on something like Protector of Lorien to save him from dying to an unexpected shadow effect or whatever is much greater than for heroes with more HP.  A more narrow margin of survivable damage (1, as opposed to 2-4 on other heroes), means that you are much more likely to find yourself in more "oh crap" moments where you have to discard more cards than you want to (or can!) just to keep the guy alive.  And, if you do use him as a defender, doesn't his greater likelihood of necessitating discarding cards to fuel Protector of Lorien largely negate the usefulness of his ability to draw extra cards?  I think it would be inifinitely preferable to simply invest a few resources in a different hero to pay for something like Self Preservation than to continually fuel your discard pile and deplete your hand for an entire game whenever an enemy just happens to draw "+1 attack strength" on a shadow card (or has a base attack strength of 3 or greater).  Still, I think that my biggest problem with Bilbo (or any Hobbit, thus far), as a defender is that with the exception of Glorfindel, every single healing card or ability in the entire game is less efficient when used on him; why waste a heal of 2 or "all" on someone that only has 1 point of damage?

Edit: To sum up the above, I think that unfortunately it's looking like Bilbo's only use at the moment may be as an attacker, with his unfortunate 1 attack strength.  A hobbit version of Dwarven Axe would do wonders for his attack capability, though.

I have to admit, I am a little puzzled by having him be Threat 9, but just like the rest of you I am dying to see what cards may be released that might make him more convincing to use.  I really think it's going to be up to card synergy to either make or break this hero.

## 28 [TrooperShark99 on May 19, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471532)

Card draw is that strong in card games, under costed card draw broke more games and cause more errata's in CCG's then any other game mechanic.  9 Might be on the high side, but I can understand FFG not wanting to under cost a free card draw engine out of the chute.  If he was cost at 6, this game would now be a Bilbo Lore + 2 heroes of your choice deck building game for mono and 2 player games.  It's simple, as long as he is alive, he DOUBLES your access to cards that help you win games.

 

With only the core set cards, without having seen the card, I would have guessed the threat cost to be 8, but in my opinion, 9 is better then 6 for this card.

## 29 [Carnivean on May 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471569)

We already have "Exhaust a Spirit character to do X" cards.

I can see more cards in this vein and when an "Exhaust a Lore character to do X" cards start appearing, in addition to the card draw, Bilbo will come into his own.  We are judging him on current card pool and about 3-4 spoiled cards, hardly fair on the little chap!

A  bit off topic but I think I might be playing Dol Guldur Orcs differently to you so wanted to clarify the above point.

When Dol Guldur Orcs is revealed, do you make the first player choose one of their characters committed to the quest to take the damage?

I read the card to mean the first player must simply choose a character committed to the quest to take the damage, so he could choose another players character if he wanted.

Therefore the chance of Bilbo being "the one" is relatively unlikel (in our games anyway).

Am I playing Dol Guldur Orcs wrongly?

## 31 [TheLightdarker on May 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471607)

Ya know, I had always just assumed the first player had to choose a character they control, but you're right, reading the card it does specifically say "The first player chooses 1 character currently committed to a quest. Deal 2 damage to that character."  So it looks like you've been playing it right, and Dol Guldur Orcs have a less painful "When Revealed" effect than I thought.  For example, Eowyn had died in a couple of my games because she was the first player's sole quester and I was interpreting the Orcs card incorrectly.  Amazing how many things one can just assume without giving it a second thought until someone else points out the obvious.  Thanks!

## 32 [BoundForGlory on May 20, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47004-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=471632)

I've been thinking about Bilbo's cost a bit more:

Berevor exhausts to draw 2.  One 2-cost attachment (Unexpected Courage), and she picks any player to draw 2 cards extra per turn, pretty much for "free."

Granted, Unexpected Courage is a second sphere required in the deck, but the cost is still pretty cheap.

Bilbo: costs 3 threat to draw 1 card per turn, and it must be the 1st player.

Berevor: costs 2 resource tokens to have an attachment that allows a draw 2 to the player of your choice.

If 2 resource tokens can get you 2 extra cards per turn to ANY player, then 1 resource token should be able to get you 1 card per turn to any player.  Bilbo gets you 1 card per turn to only the 1st player, but we'll let that slide for now.

3 recource tokens equates to about 6 threat, based on The Galadrim's Greeting.  That is a ratio of 1 resource token for 2 threat.

1 card to a player of your choice = 1 token = 2 threat

Bilbo could have cost 8 and let any player draw 1, not just the 1st player.  So, at cost 9 that forces the draw to the 1st player still seems a bit over-costed, but not as much as I first thought. 

I still think it is too risky to use Bilbo due to his shortage of HP, but hopefully Hobbits will get something to make Bilbo less risky to use.

 personally I'll just want to wait and see what else the adventure pack has to offer... in my experience the game is pretty balanced so far... I win often enough, but I'll lose just as much...

ok, it becomes proportionally easier with the amount of players, I agree, but would it be a good selling strategy to build a killer encounter deck nobody ever beats, especially for new players with no prior CCG/LCG experience? I think not... the learning curve has to be low at first...

I've been thinking about Bilbo's cost a bit more:

Berevor exhausts to draw 2.  One 2-cost attachment (Unexpected Courage), and she picks any player to draw 2 cards extra per turn, pretty much for "free."

 

 

There's more to it than just.  Start with Berevor, pay 2 resources, and draw 2 cards every turn.

First, you have to splash the Spirit Sphere into your deck.  This limits your options, because you can no longer reliably splash Tactics or Leadership.  Next, you have to draw Unexpected Courage.  If you're running 3 copies, then your chances are decent.  Now you pay the 2 resources.  These resources might have been better spent on something else that turn (but I doubt it).  What happens if Unexpected Courage is destroyed?  You have to draw another Unexpected Courage and pay 2 more resources.

In the long run, it is worth it to play Berevor+Unexpected Courage, but it is much more restricting to play this combo then it is to just play Bilbo.
