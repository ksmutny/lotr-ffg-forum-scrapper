Hi,

Another clearification because of translation issues in the german edition:

On "Glades of Cleansing" in the Druadan Forest it says

"Each Wose enemy gains archery 1."

Does this mean it adds up, so it is +1 on each Wose character?

Thanks!

Yes.Â  One who dont have arshery either will get arshery 1. Others will get +1
