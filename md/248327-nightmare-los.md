I can't wait until we can run through the whole saga on Nightmare Mode!

yeah, that will be quite the accomplishment for sure!  i need to get started on setting up for doing it on normal mode when the last box releases.  i've been putting my campaign run on hold for so long that i think i'll just start over from scratch

 

then we'll have to wait for the inevitable scouring of the shire POD quest

Yeah, I'm hoping that's going to be the GenCon release this year.

Finally had a chance to read the article and once again the writer demonstrates that he or she doesn't play the game.  (See Dense Fern Brake and Feint.)

Looking forward to it nonetheless.

 

My hunch is that the Shire Quest will be the Fellowship Night quest in November.  I don't have a good guess as to what the GenCon Quest will be though.

It isn't set in stone, that we get two different quests, is it? Last year it was Annúminas for both GenCon and Fellowship, if I am not mistaken. Sure it "introduced" epic-mode, but Shire would be the final end of the Saga...

Good point.  Hmm...

How do you mean?

"You won't be able to Feint [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/3b/f9/3bf945b0-b521-49d7-9246-06202b77fa6a/feint.png] (Core Set, 34) the Haradrim in a Dense Fern-brake..."

Dense Fern-brake only makes enemies *in the staging area* immune to player card effects, so Feint is entirely fair game.

Oh true, I was thinking they meant any attacks directly from the staging area would be immune to Feint, which should be true.

Except Feint specifies that you choose an enemy engaged with a player. It doesn't work on attacks from the staging area.

Ah. Yep.
