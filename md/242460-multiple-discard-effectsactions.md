Hi all,

I'm stuck with a burning question but haven't been able to find a strong answer yet.

Some event cards instruct you to discard a card from play (Ride to Ruin, Rear Guard, etc.). Some allies also offer a unique discard effect (Westfold Horse-Breaker, The Riddermark's Finest, etc.).

 

Can these be triggered simultaniously? For example, can I discard The Riddermark's Finest to place 2 progress tokens on a location, and then instantly play Ride to Ruin? Or do I need to choose between one of the two?

 

Thanks!

You have to choose between the two. Actions must fully resolve before the next one can be taken. You could, however, respond to such a discard with something like Valiant Sacrifice.

Just as a side note, Valiant Sacrifice works here because it says "when an ally leaves play." If it said "when an ally is destroyed" like horn of gondor (thanks errata) then it wouldn't work on The Riddermark's Finest, because it is discarded not destroyed.
