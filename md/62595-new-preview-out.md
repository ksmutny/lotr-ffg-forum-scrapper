 I've been wondering when this sort of card would come out. I don't think the fact that it's not unique makes it too powerful, considering all the encounter effects that remove attachments. It's a super exciting card! I wonder if I'll be able to utilize it well in a non-secrecy deck. As the article mentioned, Resourceful could be useful if you get it out soon enough, but it wouldn't start paying off till turn 5 after being played.

## 9 [valvorik on April 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612623)

It says:

Fortunately, The Watcher in the Water presents a solution for those players interested in testing the Secrecy mechanic and the two-hero fellowship. With its Secrecy discount, Resourceful (The Watcher in the Water, 62) costs only one to bring into play and brings you even for resources with a three-hero fellowship by your next turn.

But doesn't the card show a cost of 4 to play?

## 10 [Bomb on April 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612627)

Secrecy is an amount to discount the printed cost of the card to play it.  If you have a threat of 20 or lower, you can discount the cost of the card by the amount under Secrecy.

If you have a threat of over 20, then you can't take advantage of the discount provided by Secrecy and this specific card will cost 4 resources to play.

## 11 [monkeyrama on April 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612651)

Sure, but at the same time you don't have to play it. Ziggy/Gildor + Steward of Gondor + Resourceful + Horn of Gondor. They're could all conspire to give you some serious resource per turn, but you could be looking at a potential of 10 to 15 cards in your deck just for resource advantage overkill. That's a lot of allies having to sit on the substitute bench, IMO. Furthermore, if you're going to play Resourceful in a three-hero deck then it's going to cost 4; you better hope you get SoG and/or Ziggy/Gildor out early doors to help foot that bill.

That's not power creep.  The most powerful card you listed is Steward of Gondor, a card from the core set.  Resourceful is less powerful and more narrowly useful than Steward. 

## 16 [player585877 on April 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612702)

While it opens up the secrecy deck based on two heroes, Resourceful should be restricted, or at least limited to one sphere (Lore, for example).  It is potentially broken, I must say...  On the other hand, this will definitely signals what we are seeing so far:  treacheries are getting nastier and nastier, and for Shadow and Flame, it would be essential to hold on to the attachments.

Expect most treacheries and shadows hitting on heroes with attachments from now on.

Respectfully dissagree. the prospect of having 3 of these PER player, regardless of sphere, makes it much more powerful than the unique SoG... The price is not a problem, it will pay for itself in a few rounds, and it synergises with itself: the more Resourceful cards you have in play, the more likely you are to be able to play the next one.

 

 

## 19 [SiCK_Boy on April 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612713)

 A lot of games don't last too long... waiting 4 turns to get a card to simply pay for itself is a long time in this game. Those 4 resources could be better used playing a Northern Tracker or Haldir of Lorien and making progress on the quest.

Obviously, it does make a lot of sense for a secrecy deck to play the card (in multiple).

It looks balanced to me. Not overpowerful, but a great card to own as it opens up possibilities (just like getting the Songs attachment changed the dynamic of the game in the first cycle).

As for encounter cards attacking attachment, it's been a recurrent theme for KD and the Dwarrowdelf cycle. Road to Rivendell can be brutal in that respect. It'd be nice to see a hero with an ability preventing an attachment from being discarded later on.

I can't wait for that next preview, featuring not only the next hero, but also an actual decklist from the game's designers.

A 2 player deck that instantly springs to mind is Ziggy+Quest/Control deck and a Single hero (boromir or dunhere) secrecy deck. Put these new attachments on the secrecy deck (as Ziggy will be pulling 15 a turn anyway) + steward. Belt on Both. No songs needed. Run hammersmith for attachment fetching.... Also remember the card is neutral and 3 secrecy... so on a properly build low threat deck, it only costs 1 to cast.. not 4.

Ziggy can pull 15 resources a turn. On a perfect draw that will start happen on turn 2. Though in my experience it is normally running in turn 4. The point is that the resource phase is getting more and more trivial. You can already get a fairly reliable turn 1 northern tracker. Tragic posted that solo ziggy deck video on youtube that got 2 trackers and beon out in turn 3... the power of ziggy is well known. so 4/1 cost is not a problem for this new card.

The big problem with a ziggy deck (like any combo deck) is that if the combo dose not get set early the deck completely fails. Still with all the card draw in this game, that usually never happens, though running a dedicated "secrecy" deck would restrict card draw...

This card is more powerful than Steward. We had songs -> Belt. Steward -> Ziggy and now Ziggy + This... that is power creep.

In a single player game sure... though you would not need to run that much, as proven already a Ziggy deck can get out the power super fast already, with out the need for ANY of the other cards you just mentioned.

 

I think the argument "Oh you just do not need to play it" is stilly. We are talking about game design here.. not about play experience. Sure you can set any kind of rule to make the game harder. I know a guy that plays so you can only get spend 1 type of sphere resource a turn to make it harder.

 To me, power creep means that you'd never want to use the predecessor cards - if you say that Narvi's Belt is a power-creeped form of the Songs, then why are people still playing Songs?

I think it's just some more diversification; I don't really see it as a problem.  Let us know if you end up breaking the game with it (keeping in mind that your example doesn't work as stated, as Narvi's Belt is unique, and needs to be attached to a Dwarf hero.)

so? Who cares about power creep? Why is this even a bad thing...

Power creep in a dueling game can be a very bad thing.. not so much in a LCG.. it is more of a problem in collectable card games were the "completeness" of personal collections is much more patchy... so basically whom ever spend the most money wins. SO there are some arguments against power creep for dueling games.

This is co-op / solitaire... power creep means nothing... yes quest get easier as the card pool gets bigger.. so frick'n what? I would rather have great new cards come out, and also the current quest that come with those player cards will be of proportional difficulty. You can always just use the restricted card rules when making your decks to limit the card pool to make it more challenging when going back to old quest as well.

My point is .. yes there is power creep.. my other point is so ******* what?

 

Since when you care about power creep?

exactly, there is a big difference between playability and game design. The fact that the game is co-op and there is no torny system means that you can customize your own play experience how ever you like to make such problems other card games have meaningless. this dose NOT however suddenly mean that the designers should not be called out on bad decisions.

There is a lot of people holding out hope of a torny system, I for one think it will nvr happen.. and cards like this assure it will never happen,.

@radiskull

yeah that is a good definition of power creep. I'll start using that, I always thought it as meaning the slow continual increase of power of the cards as a whole.. as in each set ... so not individual cards.. but the entire game as a whole..

Boored: Narvi's Belt is unique, so it can't be part of 2 different decks (or at least, there can't be 2 copies in play at the same time). Your comment seemed to imply you could play two at a time.

Also, my comments were mostly from a 1 player perspective.

I don't see how Resourceful is going to combo much in a single hero deck paired with a Miner deck. The Miner deck needs his partner to run card draw (Bilbo or Beravor) as he can't just hope to always draw his combo. Getting 3 Miners in play by turn 2 without access to major draw is a fluke more than a reliable strategy. Also, the Miner deck needs some Spirit heroes to play the miner (idealy, 2 of them to ensure a first turn Miner). And he still needs to play the game. All that to say, I don't see this card making the Zigil Miner paired decks any stronger than they currently are. I'd much rather run two 3 heroes deck than try forcing secrecy for one of the two.

And I totally second Radiskull's take on power creep. I still believe this game will inevitably face the issue, but the rate at which we get player cards (as opposed to other card games where all cards are player cards) is playing for us in delaying the inevitable. We will see it. I still believe Zigil Miner was a mistake.

But Resourceful looks like a nice and balanced card to me.

For those who think they'd play it in a non-secrecy deck, what would you remove from your current build to play this new card?

## 26 [AngryMojo on April 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612752)

 While I think it'll see play in other decks, the fact that it takes four full turns to pay for itself outside of secrecy is the big limiting factor.  In four turns the game can be over, and I've seen more than enough situations where I've needed those resources for other cards.  4 is a hefty price, but worth it if the game is going to last a while.

How many rounds do your games last?  The card doesn't net you a profit until the fifth round.  In the overwhelming majority of decks you will rarely draw all three of the cards before the game is over,  much less have time to play all three and have the game take long enough to generate a profit.

Steward pays for itself in a single turn; its useful precisely because you only need one of them in play to have an amazing effect.  If you are relying on three of this card, its not a card that helps you win; its a "win more" card.  By the time you have already drawn three of any particular card you should already control the game.

For a secrecy, its amazing powerful and will be played 100% of the time.  But it's no steward.

## 28 [Bomb on April 3, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612797)

For the record, depending on how many heroes you have, you could afford this by turn 2 if you spend at most 2 resources with 3 heroes. 

## 29 [booored on April 3, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612801)

well, turn 1... everyone talks as if it is a 4 cost card.. it is a 1 cost card, that can cost 4 if the quest gets out of control. By the time you are out of secrecy you should be near the end of the game, plenty of time to get 1 or 2 these out at cost of 1. Dose it have a condition.. sure.. but like so dose support of the eagles.. your not going to run that unless someone is running eagles.. dose that make the card not ubr powerful.. of course not. Regardless of the talk of Steward vs the new attachment.. (I think it is more powerful and versatile than steward .. not unique, can spread the resource gain over multi heroes, is a neutral card, cheaper).... I do not think it can be argued that it is not powerful. So lets try not to get off topic about steward vs this new card.

This is funny. You claim this card shows power creep, but yet, when people are proving that you are wrong, you tell them do not go off topic.

Let's reiterate. In 3 heroes decks this card costs 4. Do not tell that you lower your threat so you can play it cheaper as this is not a strategy (you need multiple cards to pull it off, and usually the pressure from encounter deck means that you deal with current threat nows, so you don't have multiple turns to just lower threat). So when this card costs 4, let's compare it to Steward:

- Steward comes into play and your net resources are already 0. During the second turn, you gain 2 total, during sixth turn you gained 10 resources already.

- Resourceful comes into play and your net resources are already -4. During the second turn, you are at -3. During sixth turn , you are at +1 and this is the point when you start gaining something.

In this scenario ,Resourceful stands as a weak card , that probably will ruin your game. You are losing a lot of resources in the first  most crucial turns. Steward is great because you do not lose any resources and the gain is almost instant. Frankly, I am not that happy about having resource acceleration that starts working from the sixth turn... Still, we do not have many ways to accelerate resources, so we may try to use this card and see what happens. But this is not a game changer.

 

Now let's assume you play secrecy deck. This is where the card shines as it costs just 1. Still, lets compare it to steward.

- Steward works the same as before, but maybe it is little harder to have leadership hero inside

- Resourceful comes into play and you net resources are already -1. During the second turn, you are at 0. During third turn you are at +1 and this is the point when you start gaining something.

In this scenario, new card gives some more options to secrecy decks. It is not great because you are losing resources at the beginning of the game, but quite quickly it starts to pay off. With the limited amount of resources acceleration, every card like this can be used, especially if they are off color.

But tell me, where is power creep in such limited card that clearly is not better than previous cards? Where is a power creep, if the new card does NOT replace old cards? (but it just adds some diversity).

Ah, I get it now, you do not know what power creep means! Here is a definition for you , taken from MTG wiki:

"For example, compare Pearled Unicorn with Ronom Unicorn (create). Both have the same power, toughness, color, and creature type. The newer Ronom Unicorn, however, costs 1 less mana and has an effect, making it superior to Pearled Unicorn in almost every way."

Tell us that you see power creep, when they print non unique, or cheaper steward of gondor.

What I mean by going of topic is that these conclusion imo are completely backward.. I am not saying steward is not a good card.,. just that this one is better. Due to how versatile it is. Arguing back and forth and saying the exact thing 20 times isn't going to change yours or my opinion so why bother.. we have said our bits and other readers can make up their mind...

But as you started it up again....

Obviously you only use it in a secrecy deck or a ziggy deck, just as you do not use support of the eagles unless someone is running eagles.. you need to build your deck to utilise the card. This is a no brainier. Saying it doesn't work in a deck not designed to use it doesn't mean anything. That is like me saying if I put vassal of the wind lord in a 3 spirit hero deck it is suddenly a useless card.. it is not useless or bad, your deck building is. So yeah.. in your scenario is is a weak card.. but then so is steward if you have no songs and no leadership heroes.

Though as stated you can combo it with a ziggy deck, using ziggy to cast it on another players 3 hero deck... as ziggy sorts itself for resources. You can hard cast it for 4 on Turn1 at best. Though as I said in my tests with ziggy it usually starts to cook around T3. So Bilbo should be in the ziggy deck and Beravore should be on the table and ziggy should go first. Now ziggy has weaknesses, being a combo deck .. the combo might not trigger... in witch case the entire deck fails. Though this is SUPER rare due to card draw. I think it has happened to me twice.

Well, the card cost 1, and you get 1 back.. so it pays for itself in 1 turn. This synigises with the next time it is drawn. What makes this card better than steward is the vast variety of game situations it can be used for.. you can split your resource gain across heroes.. do not tell me you haven't played a steward and ended up with a billion resource on one hero and none on another meaning steward is in fact a 100% DEAD card... you do not need any allegiance to cast it as it is neutral, and unlike steward, its effect increases. So for 3 cost you get 3 resources, of your choice (by casting on different heroes) this to me is much more powerful. Also you can free slots in your deck to remove parting gifts witch is a lame way of handling the resource build up, though there is the belt now.

I am not saying steward isn't a strong strong card.. I am saying that this card is more versatile, fits in more decks, has a stronger effect in total and cheaper to cast.

That's just not true.  The attachment only generates cards during the resource phase, which means it generates no resources the turn you bring it out.  That's quite different from steward which, generates resources the moment it hits the table. 

In addition, I question your definition of' 'versatile'.  If a card only works with secrecy decks, its not a versatile card.  Yes, its great for secrecy, but Steward will see play in a much wider variety of decks.  That's versatility.

no versitility is how the card can be used once in a deck, as the versitility yo uare talking about is the deck construction itself. You build a deck, then the card is versatile if it can be used in many different situations. Steward only has one use. Though it is true you play it for free and is faster

Let’s take a look at how the Resourcefulness works if you don’t have a secrecy deck. Assuming you start with the card, you can play it in turn. Here is an evaluation of how you stand several turns down the road at the end of round 6.


- Resources: You have only now broken even with resource collection. You may have potentially gained a small advantage I resource distribution, but even in round six, you haven’t gained any resources. And if something destroyed the attachment, you put yourself in a huge hole.
- Cards: Remember, the card itself is a cost. You had to lose a card in hand for the privilege of not gaining any net resources. So, even six turns into the game, you have less overall assets than if you had never played the card.
- Opportunity Cost: This is the big one. You need to evaluate what you lost in not playing a different card on turn two. How many progress tokens have you lost because you didn’t play Faramir? Even a generic 2 willpower ally would probably net you 8-10 resources over this span. How many locations are still in play bogging you down because you didn’t play Northern Tracker? What could you have done with five additional actions (not to mention two resources) if you had played Unexpected Courage? You have dug a gigantic hole for yourself with no actual benefit.   Even in the next several turns when you start to net resources, you will not escape the cost of not having played a permanent asset earlier in the game.


Without secrecy, I don’t think Resourcefulness is a playable card.

I am struggling to see the consistency in your definition of versatility. You made the argument that Steward is less versatile because it requires you to use leadership. But Resourcefulness isn’t less versatile because it requires you to use secrecy? I am confused. Both are deck construction issues.

I agree with Bohemond. Without secrecy is not really cool but....... In 2 pr 3 player game 1 of the players can be resources provider with SOG with any kind of songs, Parting gifts to move resources around and with this new card as well(maybe also HOG). For example 2 player game 1 player play eagle deck and 1 players play *resources* deck  so first turn eagle player get Resourcesful, second turn Steward and 3 turn maybe Horn. Wow there is quickly build up big army of eagles in a couple of turns.Not bad at all! Really good coop combo.

I just hope with all this new cards game will be not more easy in coop game cose in my opinion game is already to easy in coop game anyway.

What makes this card better than steward is the vast variety of game situations it can be used for.. you can split your resource gain across heroes.. do not tell me you haven't played a steward and ended up with a billion resource on one hero and none on another meaning steward is in fact a 100% DEAD card... you do not need any allegiance to cast it as it is neutral, and unlike steward, its effect increases. So for 3 cost you get 3 resources, of your choice (by casting on different heroes) this to me is much more powerful. Also you can free slots in your deck to remove parting gifts witch is a lame way of handling the resource build up, though there is the belt now.

I am not saying steward isn't a strong strong card.. I am saying that this card is more versatile, fits in more decks, has a stronger effect in total and cheaper to cast.

 

 



 

That's what I am refering to when I say that this card looks better than the super awesome SoG.  In order to effectively get SoG into play, you need at least 3, or 2 if you only own one core set, in your deck.  So you get it in your hand, you play it and guess what?  the other two copies are dead weight from now on. And you better choose wisely in which hero you play it, since you run the risk of getting gazillion resources that you can't play.  Thats happened to everyone in this forum, I bet. 

Resourceful superiority is due to it's flexibility, in my opinion, not on its cost or how many resources it grants.

Multiple copies of Resourceful can be spread on different heroes, and can synergize for your next copy of it.  And you don't need Leadership resources to play it.  You can spread its cost over multiple heroes, so you don't really seriously deplete anyone when playing it.  SoG can't synergize with itself, since it is unique. 

That extra resource per turn,  means the difference between putting out a Northern Tracker vs a Lorien Guide.  And when the next copy appears in my hand, I will gladly slap it on another hero as soon as I can.  And lastly, I suspect that anyone playing Resourceful will also be playing SoG, if able, so I suspect resources arent going to be a problem from now on.

Im not too concerned about power creep, since the scenarios are also evolving, getting nastier and less generic.    What I suspect is that it's going to happen is that with each coming scenario, you will need to taylor your deck in order to win.  There would be only one type of strategy that could consistently beat them, while most decks will be crushed by the encounter deck.So it's less likely to have One deck to rule them all.

I have deck which one is beat all scenarios (except Dol-Guldor). So for now is not a problem. Maybe in the future yes but without tourny system who really cares what you play ,how you play. But tourney system delay so long....... I start to lose my hope too.

It's been a while since I've been in such disagreement over an entire post of more than 2 lines.

Resourcefulness is in no way superior to Steward of Gondor. The two cards are not even in the same league. A poster did the demonstration earlier of how long it takes for it to generate enough resources. Which part of it did you and Booored not get?

(Note: all these comments are based on playing Resourcefullness at its full 4 resource cost - nobody is arguing that the card is great with the secrecy discount).

The fact that resourcefullness can be spread over multiple heroes is not "flexibility". You need multiple copies of it in order to do that. It's not like the Dunedain attachment that can really move from one hero to another. Given the choice between playing a single Resourcefullness on a hero versus playing Steward of Gondor on that same hero, who would pick Resourcefulness?

Even that potential triple-play makes absolutely no sense. Let's do the maths and comparison with Steward of Gondor again, but stretching it for 3 copies of resourcefullness. I'll assume you play each copy as soon as possible from a 3 heroes deck.

Turn 1 - You play Steward of Gondor. You use it immediately. You are left with 2 "duplicate" Steward of Gondor in your hand and have 3 resources available. With Resourcefulness, you play nothing (3 Resourcefullness in hand), so you have the same 3 resources available (advantage SoG).

Turn 2 - The SoG guys generates 5 resources. Total count: 8 resources. Resourcefullness plays his first copies. He's down to 2 resources with 2 copies left in hand (at this point, both players have 1 attachment in play and 2 unused cards in hand, but one of them - guess which one - has 8 resources versus 2 resources for the other).

Turn 3 - SoG is now up to 13 resources. Resourcefulness plays his second copy. He's still down to 2 free resources (advantage SoG).

Turn 4 - SoG is up to 18 resources. Resourceful finaly manages to play his 3rd copy. He has 3 resources left.

Turn 5 - From this point on, each turn, the SoG player generates 5 resources while the Res player generates 6. It'll take the resource player 18 turns to catch up with the extra supply generated by Steward of Gondor.

Can it be any clearer that there's no way, at a cost of 4 resources, that this card is better or even close to being as good as Steward of Gondor? I'm not even going into the fact that the Steward guy would have had a huge army of allies in play from his 18 resources by Turn 4 while the other player is stuck with his heroes, 3 attachments and a Wandering Took at the same point in the game...

Seriously!

And as for extra SoG being useless because of its unique status, they can still be pitched for Eowyn or Protector of Lorien. That's still a better use of your cards than playing 2 additional copies of Resourcefulness...

As for this card being the difference between a Northern Tracker and a Lorien Guide, you are again so wrong... You could just play a Northern Tracker instead of Resourcefullness and still have the means to afford a Lorien Guide the next turn!

And as for scenario becoming impossible to beat with a single deck, again, I think you're way off... As player card pool increase, we'll keep getting access to more and more cards. A deck to beat them all will emerge; there are a number of great builds already efficient against "most" scenarios. The main thing we still miss is a cheap "tutor" to start playing Silver Bullets (that, or multi-use cards, such as a healing OR threat reduction on the same card, for example).

I guess just after playing it we'll know for sure how it'll work out.  If you are playing monosphere decks or dual or triple sphere without Leadership or Song of Kings, maybe SoG is all you need.    All I said is that Resourceful being neutral and non-restricted is more flexible than SoG,theres.  Being more flexible doesn't take merits off of SoG in that is cheaper, useful immediately and it gives you more resources.  That's all I said.  I can be proven wrong once I play and I will be the first one to admit it, and I'm not claiming to be the world expert on card games.  I just gave my opinion.

One more thing: I never implied that scenarios are going to be IMPOSSIBLE to beat with a single deck.  It's a matter of odds.   I just meant that with more powerful cards available, there are new mechanics introduced to the game that will make a "one size fits all decks" less likely to beat them consistently.  More ways to build a deck, but many more specific scenarios with many different mechanics.

 LOTR is a card game, with a luck component built-in.  I'm pretty sure that even with the starting decks, theres a certain order of dealts from encounter deck reveals and starting hands that can beat Dol Guldur, even if the odds are 1 in 1,000,000.  (I'm throwing out numbers here, no need to tell me that they are "so wrong on so many levels").    

Again, I'm just posting my opinion and not attacking anyone, and unless you are a playtester or Nate French, chill out and just respectfully express your opinion and let's learn to respect others'.

Saying Resourcefulness is worse than SoG isn't much of a condemnation. SoG is the best card in the game, after all (room for dispute here, but it's at LEAST in the top 5). There's something to be said for the "consistent utility" argument--Resourcefulness will never be a dead card, while multiple factors (loss of Leadership icons, another copy already in play) can make a drawn SoG useless--but that's precisely why its effect isn't as powerful as SoG's. Still, any resource acceleration has its uses, especially in the form of a neutral attachment that can slot into any deck without requiring any Songs or specific heroes.

Besides, you're all forgetting the REAL benefit offered by Steward of Gondor: the Gondor trait it gives to the attached character. Believe me, it'll become invaluable during the inevitable Minas Tirith cycle gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]
