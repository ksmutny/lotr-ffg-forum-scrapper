# [Help!!! The 3rd quest (hardest one) in Core Set](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53180-help-the-3rd-quest-hardest-one-in-core-set/)

## 1 [ktei2008 on September 15, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53180-help-the-3rd-quest-hardest-one-in-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=528370)

Me and my wife, we have 1 core set and The Hunt for Gollum expansion pack. OKay, I guess the 3rd quest (hardship level 7) is there for people to play, not playing people. So, how the hell can we complete this quest?

I'm kind of so pissed off tonight because we played so hard and we carefully built our deck and we carefully use every card and character ability. Still, we couldn't even get through State 1B! What the HELL? Is it really so so so hard?

Can anyone give some advice regarding how we should build our deck to beat this not-for-human quest?

Thank you kind people...

can you clarify what you mean here?  its a difficulty of 7, which should translate to the same difficulty no matter the number of players.  Of course, we know that this is not always the case.

Dol Guldur is definitely a terrible beast.

Some things to consider while building your decks and planning a strategy:

Keep in mind:

 * One of the heroes in play will be a prisoner until you get through that first stage.
 * You can only play one ally total each round.
 * The first stage requires 9 progress to get through it.

So you need to be able to successfully quest with enough willpower to get through that first quest stage even while being down one hero:

 * Use heroes with no less than 2 Willpower?
 * Use low cost allies with Willpower?

Potential Heroes:

 * Aragorn
 * Gloin
 * Gimli
 * Eowyn
 * Glorfindel
 * Beravor
 * Frodo (adv. pack)
 * Prince Imrahil (adv. pack)

Maybe try to consistently get through that first quest stage and determine what condition you want to be in heading into the 2nd stage.

Is low starting threat as big a factor in Dol Guldur as it was for Anduin (Hill Troll)?

Just an open question

Would playing 4 mono decks and going all out make this scenario easier?

 I don't know what you mean with going all out - but YES, I have almost never lost the 3rd scenario with four players! the "threat" of one prisoner just isn't relevant, when you have 11 other heroes... the scaling is thus not optimal - the emprisonment has its greatest effect in solo mode, as 33% of your capacity is down... as opposed to 8,3% with four players...

 

heck, I even introduced the game to a group of four people - who beat all 3 scenarios with 4 mono decks... ok, they WERE a bit lucky... but, you get me

Sorry guys, maybe I didn't describe my scenario clearly. Here's the thing: there are 3 quests in core set. The first quest has difficulty level 1 and the second one has difficulty level 4 and the last one, which I'm talking about has difficulty level 7.

There are only 2 players, which are me and my wife. We both built 2 decks which contain 50 cards for each (because the rule book says the minimum deck cards number is 50). We didn't have enough cards to build a mono deck of 50 cards, so each of us built a mixed deck (for example, I built a deck of 2 tactic hero + 1 leadership hero).

Then we played like this but we couldn't even finish stage 1... So I'm here to ask you guys: how did you deal with this quest under the condition that you have 2 players and you have to build decks of 50 cards?

Thank you for your advice. I'll look into this tonight.

What I said here is this: we have 2 players only, me and my wife and we just found the quest in cord set with difficulty level 7 is so so hard to play. So I thought it was more like that we were being played by this game, not we playing the game....

When building your decks for this quest, remember that the Spirit card Stand and Fight (and I think the Leadership card Sneak Attack) can bypass the one ally per round restriction. The FAQ mentions Stand and Fight in regards to this situation. There's a difference between "playing" a card and putting a card "in play." So while you are limited to "playing" only one ally total each round, you'd actually be playing Stand and Fight and "putting into play" another ally legally.

I've read alot about this game being extremely difficult.  I'm always down for a challenging experience as it's usually more rewarding, but is it brutal in an annoying way?

Sorry I should have prefaced it with the fact I've never played, but have been considering picking up the core set.

As far as I can tell, it's pretty much impossible solo. Tried it with almost all possible combinations of heroes and decks and nothing works. I recently got an insane string of Sneak Attacks into Gandalf multiple times in a row, very early in the game and still lost.

It's clearly not a solo quest as it scales miserably, much like Rhosgobel.

Rhosgobel works perfectly well as a solo quest. There may be some problems with the way it scales, but it does have actual scaling mechanics and the work FAR better than the non-existent scaling mechanics in Escape.
