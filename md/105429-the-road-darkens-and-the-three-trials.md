Spotted this morning that The Road Darkens and The Three Trials are both listed on amazon.co.uk as being released on the 28th of May.

And what it says about the Dunland Trap?

I generally find Amazon is always wrong when it comes to this game.

Didn't they also say Dunland trap would be released like 10 days ago? If anything the 28th sounds like the most likely date we'll receive our first AP

Yeah, another month (more or less) without previews gone, no news, more delays. It definitely does not seem like Q1 now, and it does not seem like Dunland Trap is at the stores either. A distant hope that the releases will chain together more closely afterwards.

Hopefully this week.

But if not, surely next week we'll get some news!

Got some news... sadly it has nothing to do with Dunland Trap being released.

But it is a great news nonetheless. It seems they usually have a long break before a huge spoiler, aka Glorfindel, Elrond, Galadriel...

I think they wait for people to complain and then release the next article :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

The staff should hire a full time Gollum to write as all ridiculously hard riddles. Then we could all actively break down some secrets. I'm still caught up with the spirit hero (in AP 3?) that can reinforce. I really should start a thread about that.

In the uk, amazon only lists the road darkens so far. It lists it as the 28th though. Going the be purchasing VoI expansion next week to get ready.
