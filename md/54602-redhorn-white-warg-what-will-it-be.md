seeing that all adventure pack box art is a card art too, what do you think the white warg will be?

 

Warg of the misty mountains

SURGE

engagement- 15

threat level- 1

attack-3

defense- 2

hit points 3

 

If warg of the misty mountains is dealt a shadow card with no effect return it to the staging area after it attacks

I predict that it'll be on a Treachery Card. And that card will do horrible, terrible things.

In line with the Treachery theory, it could be something like:

Pounce

When Revealed: Every player engaged with a creature must exhaust one character they control then deal one damage to that character.
