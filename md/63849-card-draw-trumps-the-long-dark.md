 So what do you all think of the new preview. It seems like any deck that is card-draw-heavy stands a better chance at beating this than other decks.

Well, this is nothing new.

Looks to me like this scenario is designed for multi player games. For multi player games in which you don't have to hit your partner's head to force him to discard Arwen (don't forget to wipe out his tears afterwards).

And now excuse me,  I have to start praying that they will include some kind of infallible Dwarven compass in this set.

Yeah, by the looks of it, we are gonna need that compass!  From what it sounds like and from what I see, this scenario is going to be tough and even tougher for solo players.  Still, I am looking forward to it no matter what.  I have yet to be let down with a single product for this game so far; the main reason for this I believe is the amazing artwork on every card.

I'm not so sure it'll be that bad to play solo. Card draw is much easier to orient toward the right player in solo and there'll be less "loss" effects in the staging area as a general rule.

I actually expect this one to be easier than the latest two quests, preparing us for a brutal back-to-back sequence culminating with the Balrog fight in the last AP of this cycle.

I hope you wrong. The RTR too easy and WITW i didn get yet but sounds also to easy. More easy? no way please….

Card draw is always good, but it also seems like one might devise a strategy centered around eliminating the enemies/locations with "Lost" effects. So, while having a large hand seems like a solid plan, negating the locate tests by removing problematic triggers could be a viable option for decks without lots of draw effects.

The introduction of new game mechanics like ambush/secrecy/lost is a double edged sword for me, I like the expansion of the game very much but I feel they are coming too quickly. I like new tactics more from special effects, like the Cave Torch.

For the Long Dark I propose hero’s or allies that is good with/helps with:

• card-draw (extra cards to sacrifice)
• eliminating locations (especially to handle "Lost" effects quickly)
• eliminating enemies (especially to handle "Lost" effects quickly)
• prediction power (ex. to help decided if is it worth to sacrifice a card?)

As always Dwarfs will help when facing Dark/Mountain locations.

Also keep in mind that lost effects may not always apply, for example, triggering all lost effects in play. When playing solo, there's is a better chance that there will be no lost effects in play. Or whatever comes, may come at a time when you can handle what it throws at you. We will almost certainly use one or more of the Khazad-Dum sets, as well, and those carry no lost effects. Denethor/Henamarth/Rumor From The Earth still looks good here to farther diminish the possibilities of drawing too many effects or to use the Pass cards.
