Hey everyone!

 

I am attending GenCon this year and was unable to get into any of the FFG events being held. So if anyone wants to just meetup and play then let me know! I'm usually in the ICC card hall till the wee hours of the morning :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] My email is andreball83@gmail.com

Do you listen to the Cardboard of the Rings podcast?  Not sure if there are any tickets left, but everyone is welcome to attend (even without a ticket - they won't tell if you won't), they are holding a LOTR event Friday at 10:00 AM.  There will be prizes, laughter, and plenty of playthroughs of the gencon quest.

Yes, you should definitely attend the CotR event - no need for a ticket. We of the Grey Company are also having a get together, at which all are welcome. It will be offsite (a bear needs his beer, after all) but we will meet at the FFG booth at 8 pm on Friday before heading out. In general, don't worry about not having tickets for specific GenCon events, there will be plenty of opportunities for fun and games. GenCon is gamer-geek Disneyland.

Sometimes I wish I lived west of the Atlantic. Hope you have fun!

Sounds like fun.  I will try to show up for that.
