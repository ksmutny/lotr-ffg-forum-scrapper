Is there another quest hero to replace her cause every time there are high threat cards in the encounter deck, i have to use her…

I used to play with Eowyn a lot as well, but I haven't played with her for quite some time now.

Here are some ways to get the Will Power you need without Eowyn

- Aragorn + Sword that was Broken + Faramir
Possible hero combination is Loragorn + Frodo + Leadership hero (usually Theodred),

- Dain + 2 Dwarf heroes
Usually gives you around 6 Will Power from the start and a defender. If you can get Erebor Recordkeepers early, Will Power won't be problem at all.

- Glorfindel + Light of Valinor
Spirit Glorfindel works better in my opinion. With Light of Valinor you can quest without exhausting him.

I certainly agree with the above.  That said, with some quests you really need the will power right off without having to use resources and play cards.

Honestly that depends how many expansions you have. If you're only just starting to collect, then she may be the best choice you have.

I have the dwarf large expansion, the hobbit large expansion, the Gondor large expansion ;

and 

Gorfindel, Aragon and Elrond small expansions :-) (Do you guys like these alt names?)

If you have a deck with a low starting threat, and/or threat reduction, it doesn't matter too much if your threat goes up a bit at the start of the game. Sometimes it is better to concentrate on killing enemies in play at the start rather than questing. Threat is just one of the "resources" you are managing. Also, Eowyn is vulnerable to nasty treacheries when questing alone. I'd generally rather rely on allies for supplying most of the questing power.

Very creative idea. I v never thought like that. You are right, i could always hire allies to do the questing jobs.

I do not use her more then 1 year already. She was only in my begining decks. She is good to get into the game but more you play less you use her.

I would also use buffed Aragorn, along with Faramir and a load of allies. Could become pretty nasty with that base set card that can untap Faramir.
