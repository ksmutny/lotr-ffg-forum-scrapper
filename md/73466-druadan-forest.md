NEW PACK….thoughts? i love the art for against the shadow

it would be great if the previews showed more of the cards- i mean i get covering them up leaves us guessing etc. but the encounter cards show absolutely nothing apart from a few stats

I really like the two card previews, it will surely allow mono-Tactics decks to beat some of the easiest quests; however, these mono decks still seem to favour cooperative play (which is not a bad thing per se).

I was expecting to see preview of HoN. I'd like to know when that's coming out, I mean more accurately than Q4. Hopefully we can expect it in November?

All in all, I am super-excited about the new cycle, HoN & AtS. The premise is very high.

I am VERY happy. We play in a group of 4 of us and always have. We also always use Mono-sphere decks…this is going to be fun.

## 4 [BoundForGlory on October 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=716313)

 Meh.  The art is great, and I'm happy for the players who use mono-sphere decks, but around here we always use mono-theme decks, which are always multi-sphere.

I doubt I'll ever use the spoiled cards.  Maybe after another year, if there gets to be 3 heroes of the same sphere in the same theme.  But FFG has a tendency to re-do existing heroes (Loragorn, Spirfindel) rather than make hero versions of allies (such as Faramir, Haldir, etc.), so I don't know if there will be enough different heroes to make this possible/worthwhile.

Still, I'm very happy that we got an article this week.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Note that these cards work with less than 3 heros. They may help building low-threat decks.

I see your concern. I am an optimist though, we are on some 28 heroes now but I see the game going well over 100 (not counting the doubles, or possible trebles). Then again, it will take a while.

 I dont see the revealed player cards as particularly useful; even if i was running a mono sphere deck i'd have a hard time justifying the card space for these 2 cost events that only help you on one turn for a phase of the game that happens every turn.  The player cards avaliable now are already so varied and useful its presently quite difficult keeping the deck at 50 cards…these just arent going to make it in for me

## 9 [Glaurung on October 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=716386)

Very very good. I love the new cycle idea and art is also amazing. I was not so happy with this hobbit boxes…… Now we comeback to real Lord of the rings thinks…… Cannot wait for HON and Against the shadow!

## 10 [lleimmoen on October 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=716391)

Of the two, I find Trained for War having much higher value (at the moment). As I said above, I still don't think I can win many quests with a mono-Tactics solo deck , and this card can hardly change that - although one can think of recycling it with Háma. However, in coop this can become a very powerful questing tool. I can imagine an Eagle deck becoming a questing machine - for a short run. And Vassal of the Windlord isn't going to be discarded (unless otherwise) after questing.

## 11 [Cunir on October 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=716396)

im loving the art too. all of the stuff thats been released for the next cycle so far looks really good. it makes a nice change of setting after being in moria for a load of quests.

 I find the newly spoilered cards awsome. They give another very amusing way of approaching this amazing game. I Think monosphere will be tons of fun to play due to the possibility to rush through a quest way faster than with bi or tri-sphere decks because one can focus all his resources on one sphere only. At the beginning they will not be as competitive as other decks (but I'm sure that will change when we get a few more cards) but certainly interesting and fun to play. That's my opinion.  Really looking forward to getting all the new packs and expansions !

Don't discount Beorn though!  

As for the cards, I think it's a cool idea.  These wouldn't work with Songs, right?  I suppose the text "printed XX icon" means that it must be on the card already, not added via other card effects.

It's really important to note the word "printed" on those two cards. That means that the resource icon has to be on the card and not through a card effect like a song.

Sadly no. As the cards state that the hero must have a "printed" resource icon you it MUST be a mono sphere deck. Not a bad thin as this opens up to other strategies.

No, karagh meant they would work in a two-hero mono-sphere deck. The cards say "all" your heroes, not "all three," so it opens but the possibility for a low-threat deck like karagh said.

 Ah okay. My bad. I'm still playing through the first cycle so didn't know of any rules about only using 2 heroes. How does that work? And from what expansion did we get that option?

You have that option from the Core Set rules. You are limited to a maximum of 3 heroes, but not to a minimum. Some cards appeared in Dwarrodelf cycle that cost less resources if player has a Threat Level less than 20. These cards have the Secrecy keyword printed.

## 22 [mr.thomasschmidt on October 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=716557)

 I see. But there has been other rules that has been interpreted in one way and then Nate has clearifyed against it. Do you know if this has been cleared with Nate? If it has it's a nice flavour to the game. Don't know if I'd sacrifice a hero just to get below 20 from the beginning. There's plenty of other ways to drop in threat than leave out a hero. I'd be interested to know if anyone plays with less than 3 heroes but I think I'll make a new thread about that.

this is pretty much the design of secrecy yes…glorfindel was just about made for this. overall secrecy is a poorly developed part of this game though i expect it shall get expanded as we go into this cycle

I hope we will see Secrecy get expanded with this cycle. However it may be that the "battlefield" type theme will take up all the card slots - meaning that secrecy might have to wait for an entire cycle to go past before being revisited.

It might fit the political intrigue angle of this cycle's story though so we may get some packs with secrecy and some without?

 

If we don't get any secrecy cards at all it might mean ffg have abandoned the idea (which would make most of the secrecy cards bad - since their biggest problem is lack of choice).

## 25 [Rapier1 on October 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=716601)

 Also does anyone think that Glade of clensing says 

"Wose enemy in play"

It would be interesting to have the Woses be an enemy that wasn't always hostile I think. (since they're neutral but suspicious of strangers) similar to how the bear was done in the road to Rivendell.

 

I hope they don't only make the Woses only enemies though, they're friendly to elves for instance.

i think is basically says increase archery  for the amount woses in play. i didnt really read the enemy part as there could be 'woses ally' but you make a good point

i also hope they arent all enemies

I am hoping if Woses are made enemies, it will only be a temporary feature, as I think there is nothing in Tolkien's canon to show they were enemies of either Rohan or Gondor. And the only mention of them in the Lord of the Rings would make one thing quite the opposite.

I too think secrecy will be put on hold in this upcoming cycle, battle and siege mechanice, together with the above mentioned mono-sphere allignement will surely take too much card spot to leave anything for secrecy. But I do hope we come back to it soon enough.

## 28 [Rapier1 on October 30, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=716683)

 Traditionally the Woses are enemies of Man (Gondor/Rohan) but only in the loosest sense.

 

They don't have a real society, and they're enemies because they do things like steal food. Which they mostly do because man is encroaching on their lands.

They don't really have an agenda beyond being left alone, but their is friction between them and humans.

Source? I don't remember reading this in any of Tolkien's work, or in the likes of Encyclopedia of Arda.

I also felt weird about the Woses being an enemy. However, perhaps the idea is that the Woses are hostile UNTIL Theoden makes peace with them during their march through the Druadan Forest during the Return of the King. In that way, since our game takes place before ROTK, they could justify the Woses attacking outsiders.

Or maybe we have some way to make "peace" with them during the events of the game and get their help against whoever we're tracking into the forest.

I love the art for the main Wose on the cover though!

My concern with all the new mechanics and keywords that are being introduced (siege, battle, archery, prowl?, etc), that some of the old ones that we've been waiting to get more developed (Secrecy, Silvan, etc.) may not see any more traction for a while….  Really hoping FFG proves my doubts unfounded!

Silvan is definitely not getting love this set, you'll be lucky if you get 1 card. (Possibly a hero?)

I think the same. As I'd said before, I feel the theme of the player cards is getting more in tune with the theme of the scenarios. Thus I feel this will be mostly Gondor, some Dúnedain or Rohan, and very little of everything else (and hopefully no Dwarves).

If we get a detour, I do hope it is Silvan. Not only that the faction is the least developed (of the big ones) but there is a hint of the Elven blood in Dol Amroth.

## 37 [ClydeCloggie on November 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=717647)

There was an Elf haven in southern Gondor called Edhellond, although in the Third Age it had been deserted by the Elves.

Nevertheless the king of all games, MECCG, used Edhellond as one of its four Havens where your fellowship would be safe from all hazards and could heal etc. 

So if we're looking for a little Silvan love  in this cycle, it may have to come from Edhellond.

 

## 38 [Rapier1 on November 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=718099)

 That could be an adventure detour. Although I think detours are less likely to occur with the new narrative focus.

## 39 [ClydeCloggie on November 2, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73466-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=718104)

Yes, I wouldn't expect a scenario to go there, but it might provide a nice excuse to include a few Silvan or Noldor characters in the packs.
