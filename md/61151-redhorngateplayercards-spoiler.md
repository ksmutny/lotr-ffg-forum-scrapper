thanks, just need to wait for pics now

holy cr*p, just read keeping count card text- talk about complicated- but awesome

dont like the look of renewed friendship- about the only card in the game that has ZERO use solo, its not even a ally that has a multiplayer effect that you can use solo, it better have good artwork so i can use it as a coaster

im trying to think of cards that have zero use 2 player so i dont feel so dissapointed.....im sure someone will shout it at me

seems some useful cards in general though

seems to be an aweful lot of 0 cost cards, i wonder why that is? got something to do with secrecy?

 Keeping Count would be awesome on Gimli and Legolas. I ususally end up questing with Gimli and Legolas does most of the killing to advance the quests. Meanwhile, Gimli takes some damage here and there until I have enough allies to quest without him, at which point he can do some major damage. Adding a copy of Keeping Count to Legolas early on and then attaching one to Gimli later would really advance this strategy while also maintaining the wonderful theme of the card.

I also like Good Meal, but I hope the art isn't as disgusting as Second Breakfast.

Most 0 Cost cards are either useless sometime in the game or have a condition to play (no immediate effect). 
Now... Unseen Strike on the other hand, seems to be a way to power tactics a little bit - still not enough, but it's definitively a start!

yes that is one of the few i dislike along with dunedain watcher (we dont need that to buy your cards ffg) and riversong (far too anime for my taste)

## 6 [Budgernaut on February 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=600035)

 I must be super dense or super satisfied with my life because I never noticed that about Dunedain Watcher until you mentioned it. But I place the blame on the artist, not FFG.

## 7 [richsabre on February 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=600036)

yeah its no biggy, im not really bothered about it, its just ive seen alot of other game art that relies on that far too much.....now no one appreciates beauty in art as much as me but i find it a tad distracting

## 8 [DurinIII on February 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=600042)

 You are so right Rich, Riversong is way too anime and clashes with the other art .

Indeed! Dúnhere was already a good addition in some tactics decks, now, he just begs to be the target of this card.
Well thought.

Hah! Thirded! I think I would run Second Breakfast far more if it weren't for that picture, lol. Easily my least favorite picture in the game which is surprising since it's a Magali Villeneuve one.

## 14 [cordeirooo on February 29, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=600278)

It looks like a Boromir/Glóin deck will be interesting to see with "Take the Initiative". 

## 15 [booored on March 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=600680)

Timely Aid - Event
Sphere: Leadership
Cost: 4
Secrecy: 3

Action: Reveal the top 5 cards of your deck and put 1 revealed ally into play, if able. Shuffle all other revealed cards back into your deck.

 

This card is insane. 3(4) cost card, that places an ally of any cost into play, + a deck scour + played ally ignores sphere colour.... this is made for the ziggy deck.... a really insane card.

With Secrecy, it's a 1 cost card. I believe the Secrecy number is subtracted from the whole, when it applies.

## 17 [cordeirooo on March 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=600765)

Yes, Grudunza is right.

Otherwise, the event with cost 2 and secrecy 2 wouldn't have any discount.

Henamarth is probably my favourite Art so far. And I like the art overall very much. But that one I often pick even though I know I might not use it.

ahh right... cool. Yeah I normally do not look at spoilers but the info is coming.. still that is even more crazy. With ziggy you can easily run a 1 hero deck, assuring secrecy, With Belt you can cast any sphere, so you can load up on all the good 4-6 costs cards... and this card just fits in perfectly. This card seams to be just crazy powerful to me...

spoiler alert (you are on a spoiler thread after all)

 

just been reading the bgg thread and for those who are wondering the quest is diff. 6 and is questing heavy- i like the sound of this,maybe it will be, and i may be wrong, a more refined, interesting version of emyn muil

## 22 [booored on March 1, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=600988)

yeah but like i said it has been a while so i couldn't resist.. normal though i like to wait till the packs are in my hands before i look at anything.. I do not even read the news ,. i think they are way to spoiler rich as well.

 

yeah that is good.. i much [prefer harder quests,, though I hope it is hard and not some lame luck thing like return. I do not like any of the quests were the difficulty is just because they have wacked some kind of clock on it.

Different folks, different strokes.

As for the male/female, I think that is what they go for in general, all Magali Villeneuve guys have very female-like facial features, I would say. But I really like it. And I think Elves should look different from men. And Henemarth goes with it.

The only art I so far quite dislike are some of the encounters. The cave troll for instance, or the hill troll for that matter (I got used to that one but he looks very cartoonish to me).

Locations are most stunning in general, I would say.

Yeah, have seen it. I like the look of the Ravenhill Scout. I love the theme too - more Dale, but boy does the card seem totally useless. Maybe it won't be in the future but so far it has very little use for the cost, I would say.

I really like Unseen Strike.

i thought you would like strike.....seems very riversongish, but less cartoonish, though i could be wrong, i could barely see them

yeah i really like the idea of ravenhill, though he seems useless, i assume he plays some role in the mountains

That wolf is evil. I'm at work so I don't have the cards with me atm, but I remember another line from the card. Forced: When attacking, Snow Wargs deal 1 damage to defending character if able.

So looks like all those wargs in this game quite nasty(same as a wolf of mordor from Osgiliath).

So if i get it right new Snow Warg ahve 2 ability  Allies cannot defend against him and when he attack he deal 1 damage to defended hero right?

If i get it right this card is really hasty! How many copies of this card there?

you may be interested in that

looks like we get mountain trolls,freezing cold condition attacthment which gives -2 hit points , and it also hints at arwen being a player/hero card saying  that it cant be played with the objective arwen

does anyone know when full spoilers usueally get uploaded to cardgamedb?

## 36 [RGun on March 4, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=601926)

 QUEST SPOILER:

The freezing condition attachment is especially nasty because during the 3rd quest phase any character with willpower that goes down to 0 gets immediately discarded from the game.  Oh, and there are treachery cards that send all of the discarded "snow" cards back into the encounter deck and (of course) the freezing condition is a snow card.

There are three copies of that enemy as well as three of every other enemy in that set  (mountain troll, mountain warg, and mountain goblin). Real nasty stuff.

Me too! It looks really impressive and foreboding - I hope they don't get rid of it altogether, though not sure if it would really fit in any of the other packs coming up...

## 43 [richsabre on March 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=602332)

Excellent! So it's not a lost cause just yet, then! I'd love to see that looming up at me in the staging area (sometimes I leave stuff there because it looks pretty, depending on my mood... explains why I lose so often, probably...)

## 45 [richsabre on March 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=602356)

haha i do the same, makes me loose so much .....as for gundabad that was pure speculation, and being in the northern reaches of the mountains would take us far from our paths in this cycle, though i think it would be great to have a quick journey there (elrohir to the group- 'someone tell my sister we're going for a bit of a detour......')

## 46 [Glaurung on March 6, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=602855)

Ok i already try it today with my friend. Play 2 games. 1 lose, 1 win. Quest is interesting but in my opinion they should to make Caradras Immune to player card effect. We didn get any snow storm and was really lucky with Dunhere to kill all Snow wargs in staging area before they even can come to us. New Uruk discard attachment ability is really nasty!

I wonna try it solo tomorrow and something tell me it will be not easy......

 

## 47 [Glaurung on March 7, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=603205)

I try it solo. Quite cool! Hard quest but there is some trick to make it more easy. Anyway enemies there really powerful beasts. Snow wargs is really nasty and Mountain wargs more powerful then other wargs from core set.

Some tips:

You must try explored Caradras on the staging area before you come to third quest card. Otherwise you will lose many characters and questing will be really difficult. Arwen really helps you a lot but on the last stage you can lose her easy cose Caradras make every questing characters -1 will power and quest card say: discard all characters with 0 will power. Every time thanks to frozen cold i lose 1 hero on the last stage.

Quest is really different to all other previous quests before, quite hard, interesting as well.

Congratulation FFG good job!!! Good begin of the new cycle!

There was some discussion on BGG as to whether this helps or not. There is no restriction on moving C out of your victory display to fulfil 2B's Forced, which doesn't say anything about moving C from the staging area to become the active location, just that C becomes the active location. Probably will get ruled that it won't come out of the victory display.

Hmmmm yes here is some unclear rule. Move Caradras from Victory display or not? Looks like we need some special rule about cards in Victory display.

I still not get it here in Bangkok. But i print some proxy and play. Sure when real one come i will buy.

I have 1 more question about 1 encounter card. Fallen stones or some.......

First player choose : 1: Remove all progress tokens from play or 2: Reveal 2 more cards from encounter deck and add it to staging area.

Question is : if i dont have any tokens in the game can i choose 1?  In setup for example there is no tokens at all! Looks like i can but im not sure......

 I think you can - consider yourself lucky.  It's like drawing an Evil Storm during setup.
