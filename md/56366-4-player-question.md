When playing with 3 or 4 players.  Do we mix together all the encounter cards from 2 core sets or just play with the exact same encounter deck as a 2 player game.  I'm wondering if FFG ever gave an official answer to that?

As far as I understand, you would use the exact same encounter deck -- I don't think the game was designed to mix multiple encounter decks together.  Imagine drawing 4 hill trolls on the first turn in Carrock =P.

 Do not mix them together.  Use just one set of encounter cards regardless of the number of players.
