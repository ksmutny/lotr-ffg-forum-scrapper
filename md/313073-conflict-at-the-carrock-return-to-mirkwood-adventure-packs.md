 * I purchased Conflict of the Carrock ,the box mentions 60 cards  enclosed but on counting I have 63 cards, the box mentions it contains card numbers: 25-49. Has anyone else found more cards in the pack?
 * The Return to Mirkwood Adventure pack only has 57 cards and I seem to have number 121 missing, does anyone know if card no. 121 should be a quantity of 3 cards?

I hope someone can help please?

Card #121 is West Road Traveler [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/West-Road-Traveller-RtM]. Is that the one that you're missing? There should be three of them. While rare, maybe it got placed in the Conflict at the Carrock pack by mistake.

I seem to recall that West Road Traveller was incorrectly numbered as #30 in some (early?) printings, though I think it was always in the correct pack - could that have caused some confusion?

You can find the exact cards contained in a pack/expansion and their quantities here (for scenario card quantities, click on the scenario title beneath "Scenario" in the right hand column, and scroll down):
