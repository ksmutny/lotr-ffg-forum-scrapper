# [When Revealed vs Peril/Hide/... TBK SPOILER ALERT!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/137526-when-revealed-vs-perilhide-tbk-spoiler-alert/)

There are often effects on encounter cards other than "When Revealed:...", which part do you do first?
Do you just read it from top left to bottom right?

For example there is this encounter card:

Crawling-Towards-Him.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Black-Riders/Crawling-Towards-Him.jpg]

 

Does the hide test happen BEFORE the "When Revealed:..." effect?

 

Also, when something is added to the stage area because of a quest effect, Setup, does the Black Rider does the Hide 2?

My understanding is that you read the card in order from top to bottom, left to right.  For this card in particular, I know you do the hide test first.

 

When revealed effects (which includes hide tests) only happen when a card is revealed, not when they are added to the staging area.  So there is no hide test during setup.  But you'll notice that the later quest cards say to reveal the black rider and add to the staging area, so in those instances you do have a hide test.

Yeah, I read it again. It says "Reveal..." on the quest card. Thanks :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Better read the keywords, 99% of the time, it's a shortend for "when revealed" but one (underground) is "after entering play" so they have a different timing.
