Quick query. If one were to play Good Meal on Frodo, and then use Stand and Fight to bring back an ally with a cost of 2 or more, would this reduce the cost by 2? I'm guessing it does, since Stand and Fight is an event, and if so, this seems to be quite a nice combo, since this would allow a cheaper way to get in some costly allies (of course, after they're dead/discarded). In any case, makes me think that Good Meal could see some very useful synergies in time. If only it could play on non-Hobbits!

I would play it that way.

 I think this is the only way to do it - what else would "reduce the cost by 2" in this situation mean?  I'm with you - I think you could pay 3 for Landroval if you wanted.

Excellent, thanks for the confirmation. I figured it did work that way, but I've found this game continually throws up unexpected misreads (or rather, I do...). This seems a far better combo in co-op, simply because it lets the hobbit deck steal some good allies from other discard piles. Still, one to tuck away.
