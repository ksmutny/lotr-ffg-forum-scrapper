One of the best characters in the movie, and one of the most useful (?) guides would love to see him in the fellowship since he was so integral and 5 years later we have no card to represent him?

He was the focus of my favourite deck in the decipher TCG for heroes as well. Any word on why they haven't used him or if they plan to?

Remember that the LCG Deluxe+Cycle are technically between The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings, so it makes little sense to have Smeagol as a player card. It has been used as objective-ally in the last Saga box.

A time ago I had an idea for Sméagol:

 

7

 

2

2

1

2

 

Gollum

Hobbit.Creature.Cursed.

Action: Raise your threat by 1 to give Gollum +1 W or +1 A (choose 1) until the end of the phase. Limit 3 times per phase.

 

Basically the threat Treebeard. It represents Gollum fighting with ferocity for "my preciousssssss...".

Response: If the first card drawn out of the encounter deck this round is an enemy, treat your threat  as -10 until the end of the round.

 

If the first card drawn out of the encounter deck this round is a treachery, treat your threat  as +10 until the end of the round.

Oh no, not the whole "treat your threat" thing again. What would happen if you combined that effect with Vanish from Sight?

He should be the first double-sided hero card tbqh fam.

VFS overwrites it for the phase.

He was wandering around looking for his Precious at that period, so you can't count him out just because of timeline issues. As for motivation, we know he's at least got the potential to do good; it's nowhere near as much of a stretch as having Grima Wormtoungue show up as a Hero.  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Grima was known at the time as a trusted counsellor of King Theoden and as such it's entirely believable that the heroes would work with him. Gollum on the other hand was known to be a vicious wretch of a thing and a couple of the heroes spent much of the time in which the game is set trying to capture him and as such there's no reason why the heroes would consider working with him.

He'd be useful in The Hunt for Gollum quest.

I don't care if he's unrealistic, it would still be fun to have him.

 

We've already got hobbit heroes that wouldn't have been involved in adventuring during this time period so that alone isn't a big showstopper for me.

 

And give us Lobelia too while you're at it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'd far rather we see the weird book characters get hero cards than more fanfiction ones.

So, it would be good if they gave us a Saruman hero. I need it (I am even trying to make some custom cards around him, and I´m really bad at that).

I made a whole set of neutral cards around the wizards. I need them too!

Sméagol didn't really exist at this time, though.  He became Gollum long ago, and didn't really resurface again until after Frodo had pity on him.
