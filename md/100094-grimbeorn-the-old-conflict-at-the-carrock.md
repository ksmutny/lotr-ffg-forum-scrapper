# [Grimbeorn the Old -- Conflict at the Carrock](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100094-grimbeorn-the-old-conflict-at-the-carrock/)

I'm wondering hard about Grimbeorn:

 

The ACTION allows 1 Leadership resource token to be placed on Grim.  Once he has 8 or more such tokens, he joins the first player as an ally.

 

Can anyone with Leadership tokens take the action?   And does that character exhaust after taking that action?

 

Or does Grim. take the action to load himself up?  Does he exhaust, even though  he seems to remain in the staging area until claimed?  If he doesn't exhaust, can he sponge up bunches of Leadershp tokens off some resource-rich  Leadership character (someone who has, sayyyyyyyy, Steward of Gondor) and get into play that much quicker?

 

Put another way, it seems to take 8 exhausting actions by some Leadership character to get him into action, unless there's some mechanic I'm missing.

No exhaust required.  If an "Action" of "Response" requires a character to exhaust, the card will explicitly state so.  Any player can trigger the action to spend one of their own Leadership resources and place that on Grimbeorn.  And of course, once those resources are on Grimbeorn, he cannot spend them... they just sit there and you get him once he has 8.  And if Oak-wood Grove is the active location, you can use any sphere's resource to pay for Grimbeorn.

Can multiple qualified characters trigger Grimbeorn's action at the same time?

not strictly "at the same time," but one after the other, yes.  It can be triggered by anyone with leadership resources whenever you have an action window.  So if you have 8 resources spread out across 3 characters, you can trigger the action 8 times back to back and get Grimbeorn all at once.

Thanks Spleen -- Grim becomes a lot more playable that way.

Hi. Just want to confirm something.

 

Can I place a leadership resource token on Grimbeorn at every action opportunity? So, if I have ample resource tokens, at each "action" I can place one token on him and get him very quickly.

 

I'm playing solo and my hero (Eowyn) has Steward of Gondor and Song of Kings. (duckshoot deck)

Not exactly. At every action window you can place as many resources as you like on Grimbeorn. The you phrased it here it sounds like you were thinking only one per action window, which is not the case. The number of times you can take an action in a given action window is only restricted if it says it is.

Just to add a little more:

 

If Oak-wood Grove [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/conflict-at-the-carrock/oak-wood-grove-catc] is the active location any resource tokens from any hero can be spent as leadership resource tokens....
