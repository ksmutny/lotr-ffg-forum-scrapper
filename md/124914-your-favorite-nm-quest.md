I'm curious.

So far what has been your favorite Nightmare mode quest? Explain why in a few sentences.

I have some,

The Hunt for Gollum probably wins it. Especially in 3/4p games because next to the regular questing and combat you need a certain amount of control to keep the Hunters from being immortally strong. I find it challenging with a lot of 'extras' the players want to perform to prevent entering a game that can't be won because the hunters are getting too strong.

We must Away Ere Break of Dawn is one I also like, but because of the mechanics I find it just a little bit harder as the normal version. There are some game mechanics that keep this quest to be relatively easy. Perhaps I should try it with another kind of deck, because now it is like Shadow and Flames. Choose the deck that kills it, and 3/4/5 rounds later you had an easy victory.

Next to those I think I like them all. Escape from Dol Guldur and Over the Misty Mountains are the hardest ones in my experience.

I like the Dead Marsher and Foundation of Stone for the otherworldy things they offer.

I beat nightmare over the misty mountains first go I'm pretty sure but have never beaten nightmare we must away. We must use very different deck types/strategies!

I like Anduin a lot. And i am very happy with the corrections in Emyn Muil.

Right now probably into the Pit. It was already a great scenario IMO and all the changes made it both more difficult yet also more thematic or perilous with the risk of cave touch running out. Despite owning all the NM Scenarioes I still truthfully haven't attempted the 6 darrowdelf cycle ones yet but currently into the pit gets the nod

Conflict at the Carrock is my favorite. I love how deciding which troll to kill first has repurcussions. The use of cards in the victory pile still affecting the game is a great idea.

My favorite is without a doubt Nightmare Journey to Rhosgobel. Granted, if you don't like building a deck or decks for the specific quest in regular mode, then you won't like nightmare because it just doubles down on what makes it unique, but if you enjoyed it then I think you would enjoy the nightmare version. 

 

Also, for my personal taste, it is just the right amount of difficulty. Not too easy so I don't feel challenged, but not too hard to the point of feeling cheap or frustrating based on how the cards are drawn. 

## 9 [PsychoRocka on October 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1301491)

Nightmare Seventh Level and then in a close second would be Nightmare Journey Down the Anduin and Nightmare Road to Rivendell.

## 10 [PsychoRocka on October 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1301496)

Actually yeah Into the Pit is really really good as well.

## 11 [Djenni on October 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1301763)

Very interesting! Any preferences? Say like Dwarrodelf over Mirkwood, or Core over either of the two cycles?

## 12 [PsychoRocka on October 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1301793)

After just playing the nightmare dwarrowdelf quests recently definitely dwarrowdelf. Then perhaps Mirkwood and then core set. They've really been improving alot lately!

## 13 [Kcall07 on October 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1301874)

Just played Road to Rivendell and had a blast.

I like quests without too many fiddly gimmicks. Where you mostly quest, attack and clear locations.

But I'm most looking forward to Foundations of Stone, so it will probably be that when I get it.

Nightmare Khazad-dum is amazing. I really enjoyed all three of the scenarios. That was the first deluxe expansion to be released, so it was a very exciting time in the game's history. It was really fun to play through those scenarios as nightmare versions.

I don't have a second cycle Nightmare cards, so i cannot say for sure but for sure  the second cycle quests is better then Mirkwood cycle. That why you probably  think Nightmare for second cycle is better?

Talking about Deluxe NM, it's hard to imagine what Into Ithilien & Cair Andros will be like in NM since they are already extremely tough in normal difficulty.

Really?  I find those quests so easy its not even fun.  If you play solo, Cair andros is top 3 easiest quest in the game.  I'm glad they are adding nightmare to those.

My experience is a bit different, multiplayer Cair Andros can be crazy difficult.

NM Hunt for Gollum is probably my favourite of those I've played so far (I've not really played the NM Dwarrowdelf yet, just some beta testing of Shadow & Flame). I'm not really interested in them making quests more difficult, I'm more interested in seeing a new experience with a familiar quest, and while all of those I've played have subtle things, Hunt for Gollum has probably the best new mechanic introduced by NM mode so far. 

 

Into the Pit is a close second, just because of the way the Cave Torch is handled.

NM Escape from Dol Goldur. No nightmare deck so far gave us such an epic feeling of victory when we were done.

Journey Down the Anduin so far. Haven't gotten a chance to play through the Heirs of Numenor Nightmare quests yet, but I don't see them knocking off Journey as my favorite. I liked the way that you could never really breathe easy during the quest, because even if you thought you were rolling, Gladden Marshlands could show up or a bunch of enemies could surge together, and all of a sudden you were in the middle of an ambush. It's one of the encounter decks that really never gives up.
