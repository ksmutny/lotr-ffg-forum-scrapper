Bombur is sad.

More importantly, I am sad, since I use Bombur in my one of my "The Hobbit" decks, but he's terribly expensive for what he is.  If the locations under the mountain were labeled "underground," he'd be nearly decent on a couple of those quests.  As it is, he's only there for theme.  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

yes bombur is an very dissapointing hero…..and i guess they dont have underground on for that very reason to make the quests harder- in addition to bombur ancestral knowledge also would have been useful

Ally you mean, don't you? Anyways, you're right. I use it very little.

 Yeah, I had Ancestral Knowledge in there, too, until I realized that all the "Cave" locations were not Underground.

It seems like they would have wanted Bombur to at least be useful in The Hobbit quests.  Maybe we'll get a more useful version of him later.  Or maybe there will be some Underground locations in the second Hobbit expansion.  Perhaps under Erebor?

Untroubled by Darkness (Underground or Dark) could've been useful as well…

And possibly Ever My Heart Rises (or whatever the name is)…  Mountain and one other keyword I believe?

ah yes ally i meant

and i think we shall get another version- the current one as stated is far too specific in his ability to be any use in the vast majority of quests…and while i understand the value of specific function cards, such a loveable character as bombur should spend his days in storage

this is one of the major problems in this game and a great consern.. we do nto get many player cards per pack as it is and 1.2 of them are situational to the cycle they were released in.. many may cards are not usable outside of the cycle.. I think this is a trend that will continue.. look at the hobbit for example.

using the hobbit set to support your claim is really an inappropriate comparison. the hobbit is sort of like a standalone expansion, meant to allow us to play through the story of the book. but even still, the vast majority of those cards are still useable in the other quests, with the exception of baggins sphere and the treasures (which is 5 cards total). 5 cards is hardly a trend or anything to be really concerned with and who knows what life bombur may see down the road.

but, outside of the 5 hobbit expansion cards and bombur, how many are cycle specific? i can't think of any (but my brain is also fried at the moment!)

yes i was impressed with the usefulness of the hobbit player cards- some great ones in there….some not so obvious like 'late adventurer' but are still very useful in my opinion and nice and themeatic

as for other useless ones, i cant think of any that top bombur, and am struggling to think of any others….untroubled by darkness and anecstral knowledge are less useful in ordinary situations, but still useable.

I don't want to upset anyone, but perhaps Bombur's uselessness in thematic. As I recall (haven't read The Hobbit in abt 2 years), Bombur was one of the more useless dwarves, at least at certain points in the book.

He was kind of useless… but he did have a good heart.

As for the  game, i imagine its an oversight by the developers. Bombor is very useful in the dwarrowdelf cycle.

 Actually I find him as useless in dwarrodelf as he is in shadows of mikwood…maybe he has a sense in khazad dum…while journeying into the pit…but one can easily do without…hope he'll have another card (like bofur) in the next saga expansion……I also think the cards in The Hobbit are great and not at all limited to the expansion…Tactics has now draw and heavy out of combat damage…and a 3 cost 2 willpower ally…the 2 cards for 1 bargain (fili and kili) though maybe limited to a dwarf deck is still great and the other cards too…cram, late adventurer and so on….
