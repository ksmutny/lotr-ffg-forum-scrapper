Hello everybody

I have questions about some cards :

1)Parting gifts says : "Move any number of resource tokens from a Leadership hero's " --> does that mean he must have a Leadership icon or a printed Leadership icon ? Can I use it on a Lore hero (for example) with Song of the king ?

2)The mountain warg has the following ability : "If Mountain Warg is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return Mountain Warg to the staging area after it attacks. ". If I cancel his attack, does his ability can trigger ? I think not, but I want confirmation. And if I defend its attack with a hero who has a burning brand equiped, does the ability trigger even if there was an effect on the shadow card (because the burning brand cancel the shadow effect) ?

1/ If "printed" is not precised it always can be a hero who gain the sphere by an effect. So you can move resources from a lore hero with song of kings!

2/ If there is no attack there is no shadow cards without effect. If the effect of the shadow is canceled that mean the shadow cards got an effect so he won't return. In all this case the enemy stay engaged with you.

1) Yes, since it says "Leadership" instead of "printed Leadership icon" you can use any leadership hero

2) If you prevent the warg's attack, his Forced ability never triggers.  If the warg is dealt a card with a shadow effect, but you subsequently cancel it with Burning Brand or some other card, his Forced ability still doesn't trigger -- he was dealt it, even though you cancelled it.  If the warg doesn't have a shadow card (because you ran out, or you used a card to *discard* the shadow before the forced effect triggers), then he doesn't have a shadow card with no effect and his Forced ability does not trigger.

Sorry to hijack the thread, but what happens if Fastred defends a Moutain Warg with a shadow effect? Can Fastred send him back to the staging area and you lower your threat by 2, or you can't because the warg returns before you trigger Fastred's response? Thanks in advance.

Fastred's Response is worded, "After Fastred defends an enemy attack, return that enemy to the staging area to reduce your threat by 2." If the Warg were in the staging area by then, then the cost—returning it to the staging area—couldn't be paid, and you thus could not reap the effect.

However, I don't think that If is true. Mountain Warg: "...return Mountain Warg to the staging area after it attacks." So what's the relationship of the timing of this trigger relative to Fastred's? Certainly, both triggers occur right after the action window of step 4 of resolving an enemy attack [Core rules, p. 18]. I think they can be considered simultaneous; thus, you should be able to choose to trigger Fastred first and get your threat reduction.

EDIT: GrandSpleen below is quite right.

You have to resolve Forced effects before player Response effects, if the trigger is simultaneous, so Fastred wouldn't work.

I think it's a delayed trigger but same principle.
