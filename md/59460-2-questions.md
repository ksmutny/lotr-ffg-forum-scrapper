1.  Can you use Born Aloft on Gandolf?

2.  When an ally from the encounter deck dies, does he go to your discard pile or to the encounter discard pile?

 Just to make sure, Born Aloft can not put ally cards that were killed back in that players hand right? Because  Born Aloft  is an Action and when a character dies it is immeditaly discarded.
