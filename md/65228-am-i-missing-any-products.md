I just surprised my wife with a nice dinner out and flowers.  So she's in a great mood.  So I need to take advantage of this fleeting opportunity and order any LOTR LCG product that I'm missing.  cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

I'm trying to figure out if I have all the currently available products.  Here's what I have:

 * Core Set (1)
 * Khazad Dum
 * Shadows of Mirkwood (all six AP's)
 * Dwarrowdelf (Redhorn Gate, Road to Rivendell, Watcher in the Water, and Long Dark)

Other than Massing at Osgiliath, am I missing anything?

Is the Hobbit available yet?  What about the last two AP's for Dwarrowdelf?

If Massing is the only thing I'm missing, then I may splurge and also buy a 2nd Core Set!  (Finally, two Unexepected Courages!)

Thanks

 You've got everything that's been published so far! (Except Osgiliath, but you knew that.)

Is Massing worth getting? 

Who is the hero in that pack?

I've heard it's very challenging solo.

No hero, just a mission! It is nice and difficult, I dont play solo so I dont know wether it is worth getting for you, personally I haver to have everything as I'm a collector!

i dont have it- bear in mind that it is just encounter cards -no hero OR player cards….as it is print on demand, im told that its incredibly hard solo

All things considered, I may skip Massing and instead invest in a 2nd Core Set. (or maybe a COC Core Set!!)

Any idea when The Hobbit will come out?

my store has august though it depends - khazad dum was about a month late on its release…..though undoubtably it will come out for the films (sigh..)
