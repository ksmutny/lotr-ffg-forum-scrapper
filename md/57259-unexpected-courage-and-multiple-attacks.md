I remember seeing this question a couple of weeks ago in the forum but can't find the thread, did we get any official answer on this?

For example, I can have Legolas with an Unexpected Courage attached, swing and kill 1 peep, then ready him and swing again to kill another...

Is that legal?

That is legal - what you can't do is attack the same enemy more than once with the same character.

I thought you cannot attack the same enemy more than once per turn. Am I correct?

i believe you are, you have the option to attack 1 enemy once per turn, so Uex.courage can let you attack multiple enemies but not the same one twice

Once per round, yes. From p. 20 of the rules:

"Each player can declare an attack (with any number of eligible attackers he controls) against each enemy with which he is engaged once each round" [emphasis mine].

The OP's play is perfectly legal. However, after Legolas attacks an enemy, neither Legolas nor any other characters controlled by the same player will be able to initiate a second attack against that same enemy until the next game round.
