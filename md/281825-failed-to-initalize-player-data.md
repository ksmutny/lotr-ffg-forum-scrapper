I can't get the digital game to work. I haven't even been able to play the tutorial. It gets to the title screen and it says failed to initalize player data please check your network connection and restart the game. I've done this several times, uninstalled and reinstalled. Is this happening to anyone else? Anybody know a fix for this?

No idea. Try the steam forums.

I got this. Restarting steam fixed it for me.

Yep. Hard to say. The game did say that there is Connection error, but in the third try it suddently just started working, so most likely some but or the server is just too full at this moment...

there has Also been some user spesific problems that only have been remedied by contacting the support... maybe Yours belong to that Group. The game is in early access at this moment so a full of bugs as anyone can Expect...
