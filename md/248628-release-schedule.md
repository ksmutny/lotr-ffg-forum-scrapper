Arkham Horror will have released 2 adventure packs in the time it took them to release 1 LOTR pack. In fact, it's still on the boat. At this rate I expect 3 Mythos Packs for every LOTR pack.  They clearly are emphasizing their new product.

LOTR is an established game and the fans/players are gonna stick around no matter how fast the APs are coming. AH is relatively new and there are still lots of players to convince and what could work better than pumping out stuff?

I don't bother to much about the frequenz of the APs. Sometimes they come faster sometimes slower. And we really can't complain there weren't any quests to play :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

The cynic in me says yeah, FFG is prioritizing AH:LCG to an absurd degree, and they even pushed out reprints in short order to meet demand (well, "attempted" to meet demand, they are still woefully behind). While AH:LCG is being pushed out at breakneck pace, LotR kind of seems to be twiddling its thumbs. I'm mean, what's the hold up? Is Cthulhu at play here stopping the boat??

But cynicism aside, there has to be some other factor in play other than FFG playing favorites. *sigh* Either way, we have to wait... >_>

It's pretty annoying! I can't recall when they were delayed this badly in the middle of a cycle. It seems like in the past they were pretty good about releasing them every month.

The optimist in me (such as it is) believes the schedule is being stretched out because the amount of content is dropping due to the saga expansions finishing up.  I.e.  They don't want huge gaps between releases.

The pessimist thinks something else.

I think FFG is having supply issues all-up. I've been meaning to get into the Arkham Horror LCG too, but none of my friendly local game stores can manage to keep any of it in stock. Coolstuffinc has the Core Set, but none of the expansions. Same problem with Mansions of Madness 2.0 (which I've been meaning to get into as well). If you spend any time on the LotR LCG Reddit, you'll see tons of people trying (to no avail) to get their hands on specific LotR packs as well.

I'm just guessing here, but my theory is that FFG/Asmodee way underestimated the demand for their cooperative games this year. It takes time to spool manufacturing lines up, so it will probably be a while before they can actually correct the problem.

Where do you live? I like in Ukraine (that's far, far away) and it takes ages for the stuff to get here, and I already got all existing Arkham Horror released expansions to the date, and that's telling something. Did you tried pre-ordering? You're saying they don't have any in stock, which leads me to the thought that you want to come into store and buy it off the shelf, but with such high-demanded game like AH LCG that might be a problem. I always pre-order my stuff, and recommend you to try doing the same.

I'm in the United States. I missed the boat for pre-ordering the early stuff like Dunwich Legacy, so now I have to wait for it to come back in stock again. It's only a mild interest, so I haven't been checking every day or anything--more like once a week. In the past, that has been sufficient for me to get my hands on games I'm interested in, but with this one I missed both the initial print run and the first reprint because I just wasn't fast enough.

I'll get it eventually. I'm on a restock alert now, so hopefully I'll be able to jump in soon.

Lots of stuff is delayed right now.  The news Runewars game had it's date pushed back and some of its expansions were just pushed a half-quarter later than originally planned.  

Personally, I'm way behind on the quests right now anyway, so I need the time to catch up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It's pretty frustrating to hear players thinking LotR is on its way out, especially for folks just getting into the game. It makes sense that they'd emphasize a new game over a more established game. After all, LotR just got a bunch of reprints from the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle landed from the boat, and CSI just sold out of them. Clearly there is demand. I'm guessing that they want to get AH buzz and a significant number of cards out so folks won't feel like they're limited in card choice.

@esplanades [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/309862-esplanades/] I totally agree with you BUT if you look at the Upcoming-page of FFG you see that we will only get The Black Serpant adventure pack before Mountain of Fire will be released (which most of us think will happen at GenCon). The other two remaining packs of the Harad-cycle are still "In Development" which is very sad especially considering the fact that the deluxe box came out in late 2016. Essentially that means we will "only" get one full cycle in a one year span which puts the LOTR LCG in the dead-last spot comparing it to the other LCG's of FFG. #feelsbad

Take the release schedule with a healthy dose of salt.  As an example, the last two packs certainly are NOT "in development".  The entire cycle and deluxe box are developed together.  This has been stated many times by FFG and the play testers.  The release schedule is simply a marketing tool.

Now that the saga boxes are likely done forever, we will probably be moving to a situation where we are only getting one deluxe and one cycle per year.  I agree this "feels bad", but it feels better than the game ending.  At least to me.  Also, FFG does have limited resources so with them clearly ramping up L5R and AH we can hope that it is only a temporary situation and we will get back to a more regular release schedule in the future.  (This is just a hope!)

AH lcg has a mini card pool, so it need to release faster.

 

LotR lcg already has a good size card pool, 1 pack for 2 months is better than none:ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]
