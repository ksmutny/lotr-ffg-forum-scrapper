So I redownloaded LackeyCCG last night to see what all has been changed for the LOTR plugin and I have to give mad props to Tragic for all the hard work he has put into the plugin. I remember downloading it when it was still in it's early stages and getting frustrated with different things like shadow cards and shuffling discard piles back into their respective decks. 

 

I have to say that I feel way more comfortable using this tool to play with friends on the other side of the country than I did when I first tried it. Also I like the Censored/Uncensored cards. That way we can use all the latest cards and quests just as long as you have the reference cards.

 

Overall I am excited about taking my board game hobby to the next frontier.  Space...err the interwebs.

I never heard of Lackey....I am currently using OCTGN and am also very happy whit it. Is there much difference between the two?

Lackey is not very confortable. OCTGN is very much better.

I respectfully disagree that OCTGN is better platform to play LotRLCG than LackeyCCG.

 

While OCTGN may be simpler to use, and therefore easier to get use to, and has (arguably) better plug-in due to various automation (refresh phase, resource phase, score calculations) that comes with it,

 

LackeyCCG is much better platform overall and has just as good plug-in and (arguably) better layout and functions once you get comfortable with it.

 

Much of features OCTGN promises after reaching certain amount of donners are already availble in LackeyCCG, including joining games in mid game, saving game in progress, sending a deck to your partner(opponent), moving cards from one deck to another, in-game chat sounds, and much more.

 

Currently OCTGN is the platform to play LotRLCG over the internet because OCTGN has more player-base due to the fact LackeyCCG hasn't been up to date for a while (although Tragic seems to have upgraded the plug-in recently now) and memetrix/GeckoTH/tydussin (sorry if I missed anyone else involved in making/maintaining the plug-in, but those 3 are only names I see in in-game credit) keeping OCTGN plug-in very up to date.

 

I've heard that OCTGN is 'better' in terms of room for future updates and so on, and I know(assume) developers of OCTGN are spending lot of their freetime into that project when they don't have to and therefore am thankful and I do use OCTGN frequently and agree it's wonderful program, but if for some reason LackeyCCG sees a comeback in LotRLCG player base I'm definitely switching back to Lackey in a heartbeat... being able to play solo game while waiting others to join in or being able to rejoin a room, reload save-pile and keep on playing after disconnecting/crashing is just too good of feature compared to what OCTGN has to offer at the moment.

Also, OCTGN is going against FFG's humble requests about not distributing cards that hasn't been on sale for at least 6 month. The maker of the LotR LCG plugin for Lackey does and has great respect for FFG.

Besides I was green with envy because I only have Mac. Finally I went through the trouble to install windows and finally getting to try octgn. My feelings compared with lackey? Meh. Greater layout maybe, but that's about it. Prefer a program that lets you play online AND solo if you want to without a lot of complications. Oh, and if the rumors are true Lackey is around the corner for appearing on iPad. I still want to see it before I believe it but it's way closer than octgn is. Also, the card scams for the lackey plugin is way better than the octgn are. I had to use some images for a third program, CardWarden for iPad, and took images from octgn at first. Seriously, I couldn't read the card text on some of the quest cards. It was just terrible.
