Part 2B of this adventure has me looking at 2 cards "at the beginning of the quest phase" and then adding one to the staging area. Am I right to assume that since this occurs "at the beginning of the quest phase", I will not have the opportunity to commit a hero or character to the quest?

Â 

The example I currently have in front of me is Thalin could commit to the quest and damage an enemy when revealed but I think he wont commit until after this card comes out so the opportunity for a "free" point of damage will be missed.

Yes, this happens before characters are committed to the quest.
