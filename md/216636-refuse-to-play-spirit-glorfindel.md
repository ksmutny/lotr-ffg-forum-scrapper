How many people refuse to play Spirit Glorfindel for balance reasons ? What other heroes would you also refuse to play and why ?

 

I myself avoid to add Glorfindel in my decks due to the high usage and knowing that having to sub out my hero frequently would be a pain. But that doesn't mean I think he or other heroes are junk, quite the other way around! I can see the power with this card having used it for a brief time.

I only don't bring him to game day, because I know a lot of other people might want to play with him.

It seems FFG thinks the one who was powerful in the novel should be powerful in the game, that's the FFG's balance principle.

I actually moved Spirit Glorfindel to the back of my binder. He has a way of being the best third hero for just about every deck and I was getting tired of seeing him.

He's the only one that falls into that category for me though.

Lately it's Arwen for me in the same "default Spirit hero" slot. The draw (with Elven-light) or resource boost is hugely beneficial, often more so than Glorfindel's +2 attack and -4 threat.

Lately for me it's been Arwen+Theodred+(Insert Lore hero here). Then with all the resource generation in combination with Elven Light and Protector of Lorien you can do some crazy stuff. So Glorfinedel has fallen by the wayside for now, until his ally version comes out.

Why is it always Spirit that gets most of the universal, splashable game-changing heroes? Glorfindel, Galadriel, Arwen, Círdan... Lore does too, to a point, with Erestor, but he's not really splashable as you have to build around him. The closest Leadership has got to that recently is Amarthiúl, but then again he requires a specific deck. And I'm not even gonna mention Tactics...

Honestly, Spirit Glorfindel is overrated. He's still obviously incredibly good, with his low threat and Asfaloth being his strongest assets imo. Nonetheless, I think resource generation and card draw is as important or even more important compared to what Glorfindel can offer. I have tried power decks with Glorfindel (Boromir-Loragorn-Glorfindel and Boromir-Galadriel-Glorfindel) and others like the Money Maker (Theodred-Grima-Arwen) and the super Bilbo deck (Bilbo-Beravor and the 3rd hero can be either Erestor, Loragorn or Galadriel - considering the errata on Love of Tales btw) and these last decks are much more consistent. Strong heroes right from the start (Boromir, Glorfindel, Gandalf, Elrond) are one way to build power decks, but a way I like even better is considering heroes who help you to setup incredibly well (Theodred, Beravor, Erestor, Galadriel, Arwen). Actually, it is my humble opinion that Galadriel is better than Glorfindel (I consider Galadriel the best Spirit hero and maybe the best hero in the game)

I'd say Arwen is by far better than Galadriel.  And the only heroes I refuse to play are the garbage ones, like Bombur.

I honestly think that Asfaloth is the main key to overuse of Glorfindel.

 

We have several great alternatives to him at this point in the game.

Spirit Merry is fantastic at lowering threat and in a deck that features hobbits and hobbit mechanics he will often be a better choice than Glorfindel.

Arwen can be a fantastic replacement and although she has a higher starting threat she has the same willpower and her ability can boost a deck by so much it isn't funny. She provides card draw as well as both resource acceleration and resource smoothing. 

Galadriel became some what of a replacement for Glorfindel in many decks upon release as well and with Nenya she actually contributes more willpower than Glorfindel. She also has a fantastic ability and not only allows allies to quest for free the turn they enter play but also provides card draw and threat reduction. 

Because both Arwen and Galadriel provide card draw they can help you draw into threat reduction faster which in a way helps combat the drawback of their higher starting threat. Galadriel lowers threat on her own and Arwen also provides resources which like the card draw will allow you to use threat reduction cards far faster and more efficiently. In the long run both of these heroes have the potential to benefit decks far more than Glorfindel will. 

Finally the upcoming Lanwyn hero is a fantastic replacement for Glorfindel. She has one less willpower but the same attack value and has ranged to boot. Her ability can boost her to 4 willpower if one surge card appears which already makes her willpower higher than Glorfindel and if two surge cards appear she can either have 6 willpower which is twice that of Glorfindel or she can have 4 willpower which is still higher and can ready and attack for 3 with ranged.

Somewhat situational but in two or more player you do see surge cards at least every second or third turn and for certain quests during most turns in fact! Yes she is a bit more niche but can quest for far more than Glorfy and can attack for just as much but with ranged as well. Her readying ability is fairly similar to LoV. During the right quest or with the right amount of players she will be far more useful than Glorfindel. 

 

LoV + Glorfindel isn't even THAT great. Yes it negates his threat gain and yes it means you can use both his 3 will and 3 attack in one turn HOWEVER if you are running both LoV and Glorfindel he is more or less 100% the target for it......

If you are NOT running Glorfindel you can place LoV on so many other heroes some of which are potentially even better recipients than he is.

In a victory display deck make sure Rossiel has both bonuses set up. With LoV she can quest for 4 then defend with 4!

Elrond can quest for 3 then use Vilya or defend for 3 and honestly having backup/extra defenders is usually more important than having backup/extra attackers. Cirdan is an AMAZING target for LoV with his ring in play as he can quest for 4 AND then ready two allies and give them both +1A/+1D. 

There are several other great targets for LoV and honestly I think it is not really a bonus anymore but is rather a setback because if you are running both LoV and Glorfindel you are more or less 100% going to need to attach it to him so he doesn't just raise your threat by several points over the course of a game. This means you can't place it on any of these better targets and are more or less restricted to putting it on him.

The last card to look at is Asfaloth, 1 progress is simply incomparable to 2 especially when it is something you can activate every turn. I honestly think Asfaloth is more or less useless if it isn't placed on Glorfindel and many other location control cards will serve you better. Without it however you are more or less forced to run other location control cards and many of them are extremely situational or subpar or the ones that are decent are usually one use and not repeatable effects. Location lock is an extremely unpleasant situation and it is far less fun or exciting to lose because of locations and location lock than it is to lose from threating out, losing heroes to nasty enemies/shadow effects etc.

His threat cost is obviously his main attraction but I think the main thing that this allows is secrecy decks and hero lineups that are powerful but don't have insane starting threat. He is used for his low starting threat in decks that feature two other high threat cost heroes, his low threat cost offsets the high ones and allows the deck to function properly without having to start on some extremely high threat level. He also serves as a very good strong hero in a lineup of low threat cost weaker heroes that rely on secrecy. Without LoV however he raises your threat over the course of a game which can in fact negate his low starting threat an be quite detrimental. 

 

So long story short I think there are definitely several alternative heroes you can use instead of him at this point and as long as you are clever in the way that you build your decks or replace him you can easily offset the lower starting threat. Yes he is extremely useful and yes he fills a slot for CERTAIN decks that no other hero can but LoV sort of sucks on him when you consider other things you could pull off with it and I honestly think Asfaloth is the best thing about him because of how subpar the vast majority of location control cards are....

 

All that being said I personally do still use him in my decks and will not be removing him any time soon and it is purely because he allows me to run Arwen Elrond and him in a deck but remain at 27 starting threat and because of Asfaloth.

If we ever see another spirit Silvan or Noldor hero at 9 or less threat cost with at least 2 willpower (ideally 3) and we also see some sort of repeatable location control that rivals Asfaloth I will definitely look at removing Glorfindel from my decks.

I only play FFG made up heroes, because it gives a lot of challenge and because there were probably many of other heroes who probably have done some things  in Middle-earth. It's like if you played for example " The One Ring " RPG you would create your own hero and wouldn't play as Glorfindel, Elrond etc. Since we can't create in Lotr LCG own heroes I prefer to use those made by FFG. I use famous or known characters as allies. But that's me because I used to be a Game Master for 18 years in many paper & pencil RPG so I see Lotr LCG as another great adventure  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  . The only drawback is that FFG made up Heroes aren't good enough to complete every quest from each cycle :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Bombur is not a garbage hero. He is a good defender and his ability actually matters in a dwarf deck. He is a hero that looks bad on paper but in an actual game he turn out to be pretty good.

There was a time Spiritfindel was the most broken hero to walk in middleearth (when he was released). Ever since HoN the encounter decks got nastier and the other spheres got better heroes too:

 

Need low threat but want to keep stats -> Glorfindel

Ever readiing fighting machine -> Boromir (actually released before Glorfindel but the attachments weren't really there to boost him)

Only defense, with ressource advantage -> Beregond

Questing, Defense, bring into play ability + 2 bonus effects -> Elrond

Carddraw -> Arwen, Galadriel

 

Let's end here, but I think it's clear what I want to show: There are many heroes with insane effects. Glorfindels effects is just really obvious and his downside easily worked around. That + the fact that he was overpowered for some time, seems to keep his "god-like image" alive. Even Asfaloth isn't that great anymore. It costs 2 for 2 Progress. How many Locations only have 2 Progress These days? So you have to use at least 2 rounds to get rid of 1 Location. Asfaloth strength is to explore a Location the Moment it gets added to the staging area, so the encounterdeck "looses" 1 Card this round. Working many rounds on one Location doesn't really help prevent Location locks or adds much Progress to the quest.

 

The carddraw and ressources other heroes offer are much stronger then the Little bit of threat Advantage Glorfindel offers.

If you play Glorfindel without Light of Valinor, it becomes a new experience.

 

And as overpowered heroes go, I think Boromir tactics is worst (in a good way).

I use him primarily for Asfaloth and thematic reasons.

The starting threat of 27 is nice but the deck would still function more or less just as well at 30 or 31 starting threat.

If we get another spirit Noldor or Silvan hero that has a similar threat level and decent willpower as well as a new repeatable location control card I will probably stop using him.

There's always the possibility of using Asfaloth with Lore Glorfi, which we rarely see.

Though nowdays I rarely use him (mostly because I like "learning" to use new heroes) I love Glorfindel -I love him in the books, thats the main reason- but I believe there are other heroes more overpowered than him. Arwen is one ... and for my part, Tactics Boromir is still the only hero with whom, while using only him and no other hero (yes, just one) I managed to beat two quests, the first from core set and Assault on Osgiliath ... Glorfindel could never do this  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Galadriel and Steed of Imladris. Not quite as good of location control, primarily because it only targets active location, but still 2 progress each round. Galadriel's Threat reduction counteracts her higher Threat and her card draw (especially if you also include the mirror and the harp) can negate the biggest downside of the steed. To bad that's a lot of cards dedicated to Galadriel. You'll also want to have unexpected courage for her, if it's not already in your deck, but at least LoV can go on someone else.

Everyone needs at least one hero with high willpower so they don't flop out of the gate. Éowyn was the first universal add on... then Spirit Glorfindel... and Arwen.. and to an extent Galadriel (Which you would need to build around a little more). Of course spirit is the Willpower boost at the start of games so they shouldn't give that power to other spheres though in the long game I feel leadership trumps questing over spirit. Of course in general spirit has limited options for their heroes.

 

They have these awesome, auto includes but then they have a lot of flops where they are even hard to build around. Other than Celeborn and Sam, other spheres really don't have that pop them into the deck for questing for a reasonable threat. Even with Celeborn, if you don't play a silvan you feel a little robbed. I personally think, outside of those mentioned Spirit heroes the only other fessable auto include for a good early game experience is Samwise and seeing the deck list I am sure I am not alone on that.

 

High willpower heroes are needed in early game to help with threat management until your army or attachments are out. The fact a lot of the high willpower spirit allies have under 10 threat makes them very playable which may bottleneck the meta slightly. I would like to see a 3 willpower a lore hero with under 10 threat. Perhaps I am just greedy. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

> There was a time Spiritfindel was the most broken hero to walk in middleearth (when he was released).

I would argue Dain was more powerful than him back then (and he still is).

 

This is interesting for me as I came into the game wanting not to use Glorfindel that much because he was so overused and I felt he was unblanced. That's kind of still true, but I've warmed to him a certain amount. On the other hand, there are also better options depending on circumstances. And while I decried those who threw Glorfindel into every single deck they built for years, I went through a similar phase myself with Galadriel. "This deck doesn't work how I want it to. Change one of the heroes to Galadriel, put in the Mirror, all fixed."

Also, since I've been playing through the quests Progression-style, I realise that when Glorfindel was released it's not just that he was a tremendously powerful option, it's that there were very few options full-stop. Even advancing to the end of Against the Shadow - Caldara needed mono-sphere, Nori and Oin needed Dwarves, Dwalin needed Orcs in the quest, Dunhere needed everyone to be low threat. Which left Eowyn, Eleanor, Frodo and Glorfindel as your options if you just wanted a Spirit hero to drop into a deck. A lot of people were less fond of Eleanor than me, and I imagine by Glorfindel's release people may have been tired of seeing Eowyn in every deck just as they were later tired of seeing Glorfindel in every deck. Add to that Glorfindel being the lowest threat hero and the only 3 attack option in Spirit at the time, with access to cheap action advantage, and it's no wonder he did so well. Now those things are less unique to him, so his only advantages are that he has all of them in one package, and Asfaloth.

i think it's still bizzare that in a game where people regularly include 3x steward of Gondor in every deck they make,  even going as far as to play 3x Good Harvest JUST so they can play Steward of Gondor... that people still complain about a hero with good stats and a low threat cost.  

I doesn't make any sense to me that people do things like that, and 3x unexpected courage, etc.   and then they say that it's Glorfindel that's unbalanced.   Please.

I love Glorfindel.  But he's seriously overpowered in the current game.  I say that because he's too easy to stuff into most Spirit decks.  Of course there may be more specialized heroes which perform better in specific circumstances, but he's just too versatile for his threat cost.  Especially when you consider the sheer power of his combined traits plus Asfaloth.

I actually think he is only remotely considered OP when playing solo due to his action advantage, combat stats, low threat to better manage the enemies and access to Asfaloth.  However, in multiplayer, his action advantage is often worthless and low threat isn't - and lets be honest - all that important.  Even starting with 30+ threat there are few (non-nightmare) quests where I worry about threating out.   In multiple player game, it's unlikely your spirit/questing player will need much combat.  So he often is ready for no reason.

That's true. I think, at least in terms of multiplayer spirit decks, Glorfindel's place will soon be taken by Lanwyn. But in solo he still offers a solid all-in-one package.

 

One thing that I notice doesn't come up much in conversations about Glorfindel is his hit points. It's been a matter of winning and losing in many of my solo games that I've been able to put an undefended attack on him or use him to soak up archery damage.

Maybe I approach deck building differently but I hardly ever come up with a deck idea that I just have a hero space open to throw someone in. I actually often have too many heroes I want in the same deck concept!  Since I don't play solo, our decks tend to focus on a particular area - questing or combat. Glorfindel becomes an odd hero choice since threat is honestly not often an issue and I don't plan on attacking if I'm focused on questing - so his stats often go to waste.  Granted, there are times when we'll play a deck that can accommodate both - like the Dunedain trap deck - but that deck is more combat oriented, so the deck that joins me should be more quest focused.  

 

I did make a really fun Beregond, Mablung, Glorfindel deck a long time ago so that I could get Light and the Silver Lamp on Glorfindel, but with so many pieces to deal with it just didn't feel as solid as a pure tactics deck or someone using Burning Brand .... ... Now I want to build a deck that uses Silver Lamp so I can pick and choose who defends which shadow cards with Burning Brand.

I do not know if this qualifies for a post in the thread but whilst I not only accept of playing Spirit Glorfindel, and indeed enjoy him probably more than any other characters (perhaps safe Beorn and Boromir), I do refuse to play some of the cards that I find ridiculous (from the design point of view): Unexpected Courage, Dain and Outlands, Dwarven Tomb being a close call.

Tactics Boomer is worse. I've only played him twice and was so bored, I've never played him since. He pretty much answers every problem once you get some attachments on him and threat reduction. He was slightly balanced in the early game when threat reduction was rarer....but now with easy threat reduction he's out of control.

He takes a fair amount of work to get set up and you also have to stack your deck with threat mitigation things.   I wouldn't say he's out of control.    but that's just my view.

Now I am tempted to build "the overpowered deck", with Dain, Nori and Boromir. Not as good as the Galadriel/Glorfindel one, but I think it will work well.

With a dwarves allies swarm deck, it should be a killer deck!

Boromir in combination with attachments that makes him powerful is in my opinion far more OP than Glorfindel with his low threat cost, Light of Valinor and Asfaloth.

But I'm not sure Boromir is too powerful by himself. It's the combination of Steward of Gondor, Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire that makes it ridiculously good. Or bad. And no, I don't consider it a fair amount of work to get him set up.

Threat reduction is not much of a problem these days. Team him up with Spirit Merry and you'll reduce your threat if an enemy is revealed (and defending/attacking enemies is the main thing that Boromirs first action is good for) and that threat reduction is usually 2-4 meaning you get to ready Boromir 2-4 times "for free" that round which usually is enough.

Steward of Gondor. The Hero that has it attached will get three resources per round. That's nice. And powerful. But don't seem too OP at first. The fact that the Hero also gets the Gondor trait which allows the Hero to attach Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire as well as get +2 defence from Gondorian Shield is what really makes Steward OP.

Speaking of Blood of Númenor and Gondorian Fire. I really don't like these two cards and never play them. It's far too easy to become a 10+ defender and 10+ attacker and they cost 0 to play!

It's ridiculous that people are complaining about Glorfindel being overpowered when Boromir exists in this game.

 

I don't know what they were thinking when they designed gondorian fire and blood of numenor. Those cards should at least cost 1 each. There's really no contest over what the most broken hero in this game is. It's Boromir. I realize it takes a little set up time, but that's easily mitigated with Gondorian Shield. The shield gives you almost as much time as you need. Seastan beating Carn Dum (a quest that very recently people on this forum had a 17 page long discussion about how it was TOO HARD), revealing an EXTRA CARD every turn to handicap himself, shows just how insane Boromir is. And he got super unlucky and didn't even get a Gondorian Shield. 

 

I've played a game with 4 players, where in one turn Boromir blocked all four players enemies, and then killed all of their enemies in one turn. No one else even had to do anything during that combat phase. One was a newish player and said that the experience ruined the game for him. He asked why he even had to bring a deck. I couldn't disagree with him. 

 

You shouldn't be able to get a hero to the point where you see 6 enemies on the board distributed amongst 4 players, all with multiple shadow cards, and say, "I raise my threat by 12, block and kill them all, and my hero takes no damage!" and you don't even have to look at the shadow cards.

 

I also agree that GF and BoN should be limit one per character, but even that is too much power for Boromir. He honestly needs to be limited to 3 or 5 times per round. Treebeard is limit 5 times. So should Boromir.

Please stop saying Boromir is broken or they might "fix" him.    Side note, I don't actually play with him at all, but I don't like the idea of errata to "fix" a card when it doesn't have to be played in the way you guys use to make it considered broken.

 

And sure, Gondorian fire and the other defense attachment are awesome if you are sitting on resources, but I tend to like playing cards, so I tend to use my resources up - even in a deck with Steward - so without just stalling around building resources, those two attachments aren't worth much.    

 

And yes, i get that is what makes Boromir powerful or OP, but to do that you need at least 3 different attachments, but you are also talking about the shield and maybe a signal, so 5 different attachments.   That is a lot of build up.  If anyone has 5 attachments on them they better be doing a lot of work anyways.

Maybe instead of nerfing Boromir there just needs to be more cards that target characters with the most attachments.  "When Revealed: Each character takes X damage where X is the number of attachments on that character.  "Something about gaining surge if the effect doesn't do too much" This effect cannot be canceled".  Peace out Boromir :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

Random stuff like that.

 

Although, I think it'd be easier to fix the source of the problem than to just hurt other decks while also hurting Boromir.  I just don't use him because he is boring, but it's definitely a bit crazy how powerful he is.

Yea. I've only tried Boromir once and didn't do too well getting him set up, so it didn't go so well, but I've seen enough videos where people get him set up. At that point, the really aren't any decisions during combat. Epic but boring.

I like winning, but I don't enjoy easy wins unless there are still a lot of fun and potentially game changing decisions to make. It's the decisions that make games fun.

Is Boromir more powerful than Glorfindel? Yes, absolutely. Is it fair to complain about Glorfindel without also complaining about Boromir? Of course.

 

The reason for this is that Glorfindel is really easy to slot into a deck. 3x light of valinor and 3x Asfaloth (if also running lore) and you are done. For Boromir to reach his potential, you need to build the entire deck around him - buff his attack/defense, maintain reliable threat reduction, be able to quest, etc. Glorfindel makes nearly every deck better, and is fairly ubiquitous. Boromir, in contrast, has a fairly limited range of very powerful deck types.

 

I would say that Glorfindel definitely has a larger impact on the game than Boromir does.

When you combo two very powerful, arguably broken, cards like Boromir and Steward of Gondor, and then add Blood and Fire (which are not powerful on their own, but have amazing combo potential as evident with Boromir) of course they seem OP. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] If anything, I would like to see Steward nerfed, but that's a topic for another day.

 

With Boromir, and while he takes some setup; he's just fun to use, combo or not. Spirit Glorfy on the other hand is ubiquitous, and he's just *yawn* boring, raw stats going for him. He's too easy to slot into a deck. Thankfully there are more heroes that have interesting abilities and synergies where you can ignore spirit Glorfy and not be penalized for doing so.

I'm amazed that in such a short time, Arwen has been included in over 10% of decks. Arwen plus Elven Light just plain solves a lot of problems and may soon kick Glorfindel out of his place. She not only gives good questing numbers like Glorfindel, she gives Spirit something it lacked: consistent card draw and/or resource generation. She has already unseated Galadriel, which is saying something.

Yup, Arwen is a really strong asset for Spirit.  My main problem with the hero is that I can't also use the ally :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]  The ally version is also very strong.

I would agree, but for the whole Noldor/Aragorn thing. She can't as easily be splashed into a non Noldor deck. Glorfindel just plays well with others.

His ability is only good either against encounters that have a lot of doom or threat raising, or if you include doom cards/Boromir yourself.  Otherwise I've only used him because his name is Aragorn (for his attachments) and I needed a Lore hero.

I had some time this weekend so I built seastan's two handed boromir decks and took them against 4 different nightmare decks....absolutely crushed them all. I'm very impressed. My gf made the comment that game is too easy with them. I get people saying he needs a lot of set up to be at his max potential, but you don't him to be at his max to be OP. Really for 90% of enemies you only need the arwen ally and gondorian shield and boromir is nearly unstoppable. 5 defense and can block any number of enemies. I won't deny that glorfindel is in more types of decks, but even if boromir only fits in one type of deck, that deck can crush nearly any quest. Ffg has errata'ed far less powerful cards, I wonder why this one hasn't been errata'ed yet.

I'm in no hurry for FFG to errata cards because they're overpowered in one of Seastan's decks.  Have we learned nothing from what happened to Horn of Gondor or Master of Lore?  Boromir might be more balanced with a (limit once per round) slapped on him, but he'd be far less interesting.

You have to be careful with that. New scenarios are designed and playtested with the current card pool in mind. I really don't want to get into a situation where you have to play finely-honed power decks to beat a quest.

 

Adding "(Limit once per round while your threat is under 40)" would be a vaguely thematic nerf.

New scenarios may be tested with the current card pool in mind, but they have not in the past been constructed to be defeated only with "finely-honed power decks" -- at least not all or even most of the quests in a cycle.

 

Based on past history, I'd rather take my chances with FFG's scenarios than FFG's erratas.

I think "once per phase" is a good limitation on Boromir. Still lets you defend twice or defend and attack, though you still get away with Peace And Thought nonsense.

That might be too extreme. I'd settle for three times a round. That still gives him 4 actions a turn. While he'd still be powerful, he couldn't block everyone on the board and then kill every enemy.

Hadn't thought of Glorfindel + To the Sea + Galdor......

 

First turn. Play To the Sea! and another 1 cost or even a 0 cost card.

Discard four cards to To the Sea! to reduce Glorfindel (or even Gildor for this matter.....) to 1 cost and play him with your last resource...

(Mega bonus if any of these discarded cards are Elven Light or Lords of the Eldar)

Then simply trigger Galdor's ability and get a new starting hand....

If you used this combo to play Gildor instead of Glorfindel you could discard Glorfindel as one of the 4 cards and then next turn you could play him for just 1 resource with To the Sea as well... you would have all new cards from Galdor...

(note that nowhere is there any connection to playing from your hand it just states "next noldor ally played this phase" which means you can use it when playing Glorfindel from the discard pile)

jesus.....

Might be time for round 300 on contemplating how to take the Glorfindel hero out of my decks and not have them just completely suck against certain quests without Asfaloth...

Man I wish that Asfaloth could be attached to the ally version.... it should have been attach to a noldor or silvan character rather than hero....

I hope we get a few other ways to deal with locations in this upcoming cycle... those recent spoilers were awesome and very promising but I really hope we get a few other location control cards..

another for noldor would be great but I have a sinking feeling that Imladris Steed was the Noldor location card and we won't get another.... same goes for Hithlain with Silvan...

You know, why can't we ever get a splash-in Leadership hero?

 

Aragorn- Needs a low cost curve deck or Theodred to work.

Theodred- Usually useless

Gloin- Useless

Thorin- Dwarves

Dain- Dwarves

Imrahil- Eagles

Elrohir- Elladen

Boromir- Gondor

Balin- Oh yes!

 

Those are the Leadership heroes that I have anyway.

You are super wrong.

 

Also Aragorn can work fine with just Steward funding his ability, but his high threat cost makes him not such a good candidate for splashing in. Looking further through the card pool thn I guess you have, we also have Sam Gamgee and the new Leadership Denethor who are great splashes.

Imrahil also works great with Silvan, in a Galadriel & Eomer deck. I've also seen him "splash" Leadership with Bifur/Mirlonde Lore deck that relied on chump blocking. It wasn't super effective but I'd paired it with a mono-Tactics Ranged and handled the encounter deck well enough.

I think those are the reasons he said we did still need Glorfindel.

 

Personally I have very mixed feelings about Glorfindel and agree 100% with PsychoRocka on this.  I don't actually like Glorfindel, but I need low threat and good location clearing.  Many turns Glorfindel being ready after the questing phase is a waste, but to have Asfaloth makes it worth it.  I think someone posted before suggesting that it would be better if Asfaloth gave everyone the same location clearing, but simply cost less to equip to Glorfindel and I think if that was how the card worked Glorfindel wouldn't be around nearly as much.

I've been struggling to work Glorfindel into decks recently because he doesn't really do anything. Even when I use him as a starting point I tend to put him to one side after deciding on a general strategy, where other heroes inevitably combine better.

I put this together before RingsDB so I've tried to piece together what I remember from the deck. It may be off by a couple of cards from my original decklist, and like the notes say, it needs some tweaking. I'm a slightly lazy deck-builder, and if something is good enough to win, I'm not inclined to look for "win-more" sideboards.
