i know theres going to be a few of the expansions that follow the mirkwood storyline, and given that the game is set (i think mainly based, correct me if im wrong) between the hobbit and TFOTR events, what do you think is going to come after? or what do you hope is released?

 

personally ive always thought that the hobbit was tolkeins best, so i hope something that revolves around Erebor, dale or the trollshaws

 

anyways theres obvs plenty of scope here, and im looking forward to, and will betting exited to see each new releases
