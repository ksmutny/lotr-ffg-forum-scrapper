 hello some quick questions

 

If I engage the enemy before i do the engagement checks is it correct that the enemy then loses it's engagement benefit?( if .... engages a player it get's....)

After buying the expansions I now have the attachement cards "song", they give you an extra resource icon, does it mean that every resource phase I get 2 resource tokens for that hero?  (because in my opinion if you can attach this to 2 or 3 heroes it does make the game in solo play a little bit less tough, not that i'm against that.......)

The attachment "dundedain mark, can it be attached twice to the same hero?

The rules clearly state that it makes no difference wether you engage an enemy or it engages you.  You are still engaged (Congratulations!) and take all the consequences.  The choice before proper engagement checks, just gives you a bit of leeway in multi-player games as to who takes on what.  Watch the goblin sniper!

Songs only give you the sphere mark, not extra resources.  They are only useful in mixed sphere decks, but be careful to remember that the Planning Phase is 1 player at a time.  You can't pay for other players cards, although you can put your attachments on other players cards.

There are no restrictions on any of the Dunedain cards.  Quest, Mark or Warning.  So no limits, but if that character dies, you lose the lot.  I believe some/all of these cards can be moved to other character by paying resources.

Cheers!

Sorry if this has been answered elsewhere, but I couldn't find it with a forum search:

 

For all of the Dunedain cards, if you play the attachment on another player's hero, who controls the action?  It seems odd that you would be able to spend their resources, but it also seems odd that you would lose control of the attachment.

Page 25 in the rulebook.

"When a player plays an attachment card, he has the option of giving control of that card to another player by attaching the card to one of that player’s characters. Players always assume control of attachments that have been played on their characters. If control of that character changes, so does the control of any attachments on that character."
