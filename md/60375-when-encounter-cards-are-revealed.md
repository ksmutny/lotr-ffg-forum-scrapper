## 1 [Nerdmeister on February 12, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60375-when-encounter-cards-are-revealed/?do=findComment&comment=593424)

Just played "The Seventh Level" quest in a 2-player game and an issue arose. At quest card 2B it says that "after the staging step discard X additional cards from the encounter deck and add any enemies to the staging area. X is the number of players in the game"

Now the question is: are those enemies technically revealed?

This is important both for effects like Thalins "deal 1 damage to enemies revealed while Thalin is commited to quest" ability but also the Orc Horn Blower enemy which has both surge and a when-revealed ability that says to "draw an aditional encounter card and add it to the staging area" (kinda like a double surge). The surge itself is redefined in the FAQ as being triggered whenever the card enters play so that one is straightforward enough.

Any and all thoughts on the matter will be appreciated

Are you using non-English cards? The English card text on Stage 2B says, "At the end of the staging step, reveal the top X cards of the encounter deck, adding all enemies to the staging area. Discard the other revealed cards without resolving them. X is the number of players." [emphasis mine]

So, the extra encounter cards are all "revealed." Enemies are revealed and added to the staging area (triggering any applicable effects), while any other encounter cards are revealed and immediately discarded. Hope that helps.

Actually I do have the english version of the game.

On the other hand I have just diagnosed myself with an aneurism because the card says excactly what you say it does sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]. I mixed it up with the cave torch which does say to discard the top card from the encounter deck and then add it to the staging area if it is an enemy.

I guess I´ll simply transfer my question to that card instead then lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

In the case of Cave Torch, the enemies are not "revealed" for gameplay purposes. They are simply added to the staging area. So, effects like Thalin's (should you activate the torch during the quest phase) and the "when revealed" ability on Goblin Follower will not trigger.

Thalins effect ONLY effects cards revealed during the questing phase when cards are revealed. That is it. So cave tourch.. no... no wound. Quest card you mentioned.. no wound...

Though you could still activate the torch in the questing phase.

A character is considered dedicated to the quest untill the end of the quest phase, not just the staging step. You could even wait till after the quest resolution before activating the torch and Thalin would still be considered dedicated to the quest (though it doesn´t matter that he is since they are not technically revealed anyway)

Also he wounds on cards revealed outside of the questing step since he is considered commited to the quest till the end of the phase.

Rulebook page 14 bottom: "characters commited to a quest are considered commited to that quest through the end of the quest phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect"

no.... activating the torch even in teh quest phase will NOT get a wound from thalin... only cards revealed during he staging step of the questing phase get the wounds.. so that is the "reveal 1 per player" and any surge effects...

Thalin says he deals 1 wound to "each enemy as it is revealed by the encounter deck."  Why wouldn't a revealed enemy take a wound if it was revealed while Thalin was questing?

Within the context of Cave Torch, however, Thalin doesn't work - Cave Torch doesn't reveal cards.  It discards them, and then maybe puts them into play.

Just wanted to concur here. Thalin will damage any enemies revealed by the forced effect on Stage 2B of The Seventh Level. That effect specifically instructs players to "reveal" the encounter cards, and Thalin damages enemies as they are revealed. The staging step is part of the quest phase, and Thalin remains committed to the quest until the end of the quest phase.
