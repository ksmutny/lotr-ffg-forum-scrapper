Huh, they didn't give an exhibit on Vanish from Sight... Maybe they're working on an FAQ as we speak?

Interesting. What is the initial experience with the Leadership Denethor hero round here?

I picked up mine yesterday. I thought I was going to be able to get in a game last night, but something came up. The quest is DL6 and has a new setup system. There are C & D quests cards in addition to A & B. Hope to get a game in later. I'll start a spoiler thread then if no one else has.
