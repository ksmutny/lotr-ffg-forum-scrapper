I know pack 6 is a while away; however I don't know how far ahead of releases the design work is.

 

My suggestion is that for the second half of the dwarrowdwelf cycle the dwarven treasure cards (random cards from the encounter deck) get turned into treasure cards. I always felt they should have been incorporated into the adventure in an ongoing way.

I believe they would have been if this set had come out after the hobbit saga.

 

 

I would like them to be kept as random reveal treasures although I would like subsequent adventures in the cycle to include a set-up rule saying you can start with those cards in play if you earned them in a previous adventure in the cycle. 
 

Obviously I would also like the difficulty of the nightmare modes to be made even harder to account for this bonus.

 

In a similar vein I hope to see "campaign mode" boons and burdens for each cycle to be made in future because I really do think campaign mode is the future of the game - they would really help to build up the story telling potential which seems to already be ramping up quite a lot with each new release.

Funny how that's such an obvious suggestion, but hadn't occurred to me before! Thanks for pointing it out, it would be good if we could keep the Dwarf stuff from adventure to adventure, perhaps in NM mode having enemies or treacheries that force the discard of objective cards, or interact in some way, giving cards surge or whatever. 

 

The idea of having an official campaign mode supplement for the existing cycles would be marvellous, and I'd definitely jump on that as soon as it was released! I think the most exciting thing about NM mode, for me, is that FFG have shown a willingness to go back and keep the old quests as current as they can, so on that basis something like a campaign pack of boons and burdens shouldn't be out of the question, further down the line. 

 

How would that be implemented, though? As much of a fan of POD I am for giving us "other" stuff that FFG think wouldn't fare quite as well in general release, it seems to me that so far, all of the POD stuff for this game has been stuff that would just as quickly have been snapped up in general release. Perhaps the lure of the bigger profit from essentially manufacturing in-house is really behind it. 

 

I've felt for a long time now that, because LotR is so different from the other LCGs, it doesn't really need to conform to the six-pack-cycle format, we could conceivably have one-off expansion packs, such as a campaign pack, that is intended for expanding the expansions, as it were. They could change the model of release so that we get an all-player-card pack, or an all-scenario pack. In actual fact, I would prefer more scenario cards in the adventure packs anyway, and I'm still waiting for these epic quests where your threat can go above 50 (as per the rulebook), which might be best implemented with longer scenarios. 

 

Okay, this has become a bit rambling and far removed from the main topic, so I'll stop. But yeah, more support for reverse-implementation of Campaign Mode!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]
