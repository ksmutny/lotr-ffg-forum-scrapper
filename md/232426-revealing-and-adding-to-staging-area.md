I believe I have this right, but if when an encounter card is revealed, it's not part of the staging area, correct?

 

First time playing "The Siege of Gondor" and the quest card says Ship locations in the staging area are immune to player card effects. I've revealed a Ship location, but I assume I can play Strider's Path on it to make it the active location because I don't believe it's part of the staging area yet.

I don't think that's correct. Contrast Strider's Path with Thalin. Strider's Path says "Response: After a location is revealed ..." but Thalin says "... as it is revealed by the encounter deck." FAQ entry 1.37 says to resolve "passive abilities first, Forced effects second, Response actions third. When determining the order of effect resolution among abilities within those categories, players should first resolve abilities that use the word “when” and then resolve abilities with the word “after”." And the rulebook, on page 14, says that "encounter cards are revealed one at a time, with any “when revealed” effects being resolved before the next card is revealed. Enemy and location cards revealed in this manner are placed in the staging area, treachery cards are resolved and (unless otherwise indicated by the card text) placed in the discard pile."

 

Let's put all those things together. You must resolve "When" effects before you resolve "After" effects. Therefore, by the time you can resolve "After a location is revealed", you must have resolved the "When Revealed" effect first. And since all revealed cards are placed in the staging area before the next card is revealed, I think it's fair to say that "add to the staging area" is considered part of the "reveal" effect. (The FAQ clarifies that "reveal" always means "reveal and add to the staging area"). I don't think the two are separable, which means that by the time you can play any "After X is revealed" effects, card X is already in the staging area. Thalin gets to interrupt the card (and, for example, kill 1-HP enemies that surge before their Surge keyword can trigger) because he's an "as" effect. But Strider's Path is an "After" effect, so the whole reveal-and-add process has to happen first.

 

Therefore, by the time you can play Strider's Path on a Ship location, it's already in the staging area and under the effect of the quest card, making it immune to Strider's Path.

Section 1.37 deals with "resolving multiple effects with a shared condition," which is not really the case here. Instead, I would say there's a sequence of events intended to play out. The question is, what's that sequence? In that regard, I started scanning the FAQ more, and found this on page 16...

 

Q: When an enemy makes an attack as part of its
“when revealed” effect, is that enemy in the staging
area?
 
A: No. Enemies are added to the staging after resolving
their “when revealed” effects. An enemy that makes an
attack as part of its “when revealed” effect, is not in
the staging area or engaged with the defending player
unless a card effect says it is.
 
This would seem to support what I suspect -- the location is not in the staging area "when revealed," which is when Strider's Path can be played.

Strider's Path tells you everything you need to know about when to play it: after a location is revealed, which implies that the entire process of revealing is complete (and in this case, the Ship is immune to player card effects).

That appears in complete contrast to the FAQ I quoted above. Why would this be different?

> That appears in complete contrast to the FAQ I quoted above. Why would this be different?

Again, because Responses occur after their triggering condition (in this case after a location is revealed), in contrast to When Revealed effects which occur immediately.

Ah, good, I'd been looking for an answer to "Is the card in the staging area during When Revealed effects?" Thanks for finding that. So if Strider's Path said "When a location is revealed", then I'd be 100% in agreement with you. But it says "After". And so the question is: is adding to the staging area considered part of the revealing process? Or is it more like there was a card effect that says "After a card is revealed, add it to the staging area"?

 

If it's the latter, then you have two effects that should trigger at once, so the player gets to pick the most advantageous order. But if it's the former, then the card has landed in the staging area before you can trigger "After a card is revealed" effects.

 

Since the core rulebook says that cards are revealed one at a time, with "When Revealed" effects resolving before the next card comes out, and "cards revealed in this manner are placed in the staging area", I believe that means that the "add to the staging area" is part of the reveal process, rather than something that happens as a separate step. But I'll grant that it's something that is not quite clear, hence your confusion.

Why the distinction here? Why use different text if these are the same trigger?

 

 

Predatory-Wolves.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Wastes-of-Eriador/Predatory-Wolves.jpg]

 

Maybe this line of thought will help: When do you trigger Merry's effect with Predatory Wolves? You must trigger it after the enemy was revealed, but before it was added to the staging area, because if you resolve the text that says "add it to the staging area", you've done something else and are unable to trigger Merry.

While I rather like this point, and am leaning towards the interpretation that allows Strider's Path to be played, I nevertheless want to point out one possible line of reasoning:

 

- FAQ 1.45: 'If a card effect uses the phase [sic] “Reveal and add to the staging area”, it means the same as simply using the word “reveal”...'

- Therefore, I am to read Predatory Wolves as '...search the encounter deck and discard pile for a Warg enemy, and reveal it. Shuffle the encounter deck.'

- Thus I can trigger Merry no matter when the actual adding of the enemy to the staging area occurs with respect to an "after revealed" trigger.

 

This is a bit tortured, but given such an interpretation, I am unsure if the last sentence of what you said actually clarifies the situation.

## 10 [JYoder on October 15, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2458583)

Kakita and rmunn -- I see what you mean now: That Strider's Path says "After revealed" rather than "When revealed" which is a good distinction, and you believe adding it to the staging area is part of the reveal.

 

However, I don't think adding to the staging area is part of "When revealed," but is the next step. Hence, an "After revealed" response like Strider's Path (which is before a location can even enter the staging area) seems legit to me. Seastan -- if I'm understanding you, that's what you're saying too? (Though regarding Merry, it does say revealed from the top of the encounter deck, which is not happening with Predatory Wolves.)

 

Here's a "for instance" -- say you reveal a location that has an effect that occurs when it gets added to the staging area (not sure there is one) and say the active location also has an effect that triggers when added to the staging area. In my mind, if I play Strider's Path, it doesn't make sense to trigger the new location's effect (saying it made it to the staging area), and then do the same with the active location. To me, Strider's Path prevents the new location from ever entering the staging area.

Whoops, I didn't see that, either! Excellent point.

 

One other thing: Merry and Anborn clearly have different triggers, as many effects will trigger Anborn but not Merry, e.g., A Light in the Dark. The question remains as to precisely when, in the context of revealing, an enemy is added to the staging area vis a vis an "after revealed" trigger.

 

I went ahead and submitted an official query about all this, so I will report back with the answer.

Good catch, but there are other responses that don't require the "top" card to be revealed (like Leadership Gimli ally), so the question still stands.

Kind of sad that revealing/staging have become so complicated.

It's not official. Just something made by myself and a couple other contributors. It aims to be consistent with every ruling we've had so far concerning revealing encounter cards.

Caleb's response to my email is Strider's Path doesn't work in this instant. He wrote...

 

After an enemy or location is revealed, it is added to the staging area. Since Strider’s Path triggers “After a location is revealed…” that means the location would be in the staging area when you play it. As a result, a Ship location would be immune to its effect, preventing you from targeting the Ship location with Strider’s Path.

 

 

Seems very off to me (and I've replied asking for more clarification with other instances) but unless he says different, you'll want to alter your doc.

 

As much as I love this game, I hate all the hoops  the FAQ and corner cases jump thru to prevent certain card combos. It gets discouraging and can drive newbies away. His response seems to imply that "The Door is Closed" shouldn't work in this case either, which seems doubly wrong to me. I thought that card could work on cards that are "Immune to player card effects" because the encounter card hasn't entered the game yet. Or am I wrong about that?

While I am of course sympathetic to frustrations with the rules complexity of this game, I find this particular case a curious one to get discouraged over. If your mental model of the game included adding encounter cards to the staging area as part of the revealing process, as rmunn alluded to above, then the ruling should make sense.

 

(I got the same official response as you to the question, of course, and I followed it up with a clarifying question of my own. I will report back here with the results.)

 

As far as The Door is Closed in this situation, Seastan's guide links to the rather more confusing discussion that surrounded his decision to place The Door is Closed where is is:

 

https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?p=1897121 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193016-the-battle-is-joined/?p=1897121]

 

Among other things, it seems to boil down to the misleading use of the phrase "after an encounter card is revealed" on The Door is Closed. Frustration with near-identical phrasing but different results? Now that I can get behind.

That's what I'm saying -- the phrasing between Strider's path and The Door is Closed is near-identical, hence my frustration. So why should they have a different result?

 

The Door is Closed: "After an encounter card is revealed from the encounter deck..."

 

Strider's Path: "After a location is revealed from the encounter deck..."

 

Barring a card type clarification for the latter, that is the same wording. The Door is Closed can be played on encounter cards that have the Immune label, right? That's because it occurs before the card has been put into play -- before it's been put into the staging area. If so, then Strider's Path should work the same -- before the card is placed into the staging area. Am I missing something?

I believe the general consensus is that The Door is Closed is poorly worded, so you should probably not be extrapolating too much from it. (Also, as a cancellation effect, it gets special treatment.)

 

As far as it working on Immune cards, did anyone ever actually get a ruling on that one? Seastan's guide implies a belief that it doesn't work.

If The Door is Closed gets special treatment, that's news to me. And if it doesn't work on normally Immune cards (even though the card isn't yet in play... yet its supposed to get special treatment... which seems especially true since it is indeed a cancellation effect)... well... then I'll just have to wave the white flag and call it a day.  :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

It's in the latest FAQ. Cancellation effects get priority before any other triggered effect.

I understand that. Hence why I assume it should cancel even cards that say Immune, as they aren't in play yet.

 

I guess I view cards like Strider's Path as a type of cancellation effect... but I suppose I shouldn't as it doesn't actually use the word "cancel".

Revealed cards are in play and text is active.  So, if immune, they are immune to cancellation effects.

 

For comparison: Thalin's damaged is cancelled by Toughness.  As the card is being revealed, it has come into play and the Toughness keyword is active (this has been officially ruled on).

## 24 [shosuko on October 18, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2462468)

Strider's Path should not allow you to travel to a location that is immune to player card effects.  When a card is revealed it immediately enters play without any break between them.

 

(1.37) Timing of effect resolution When resolving multiple effects with a shared condition, players should use this order of resolution: passive abilities first, Forced effects second, Response actions third. When determining the order of effect resolution among abilities within those categories, players should first resolve abilities that use the word “when” and then resolve abilities with the word “after”. A player card effect that cancels an encounter card effect interrupts this timing structure. A cancel effect must be triggered immediately after the encounter card effect that it cancels.

 

This is the reason The Door is Closed! works, and Strider's Path doesn't.  It's not because of the wording for what it responds to, but because TDiC is a canceling type event.

You must trigger it after the enemy was revealed, but before it was added to the staging area, because if you resolve the text that says "add it to the staging area", you've done something else and are unable to trigger Merry.

 

Isn't the difference between these that Merry would ONLY trigger when a card is revealed where Anborn encompasses cards being revealed as well as cards entering the staging area from other sources?

Isn't that part of the trick to trapping trolls?

I'm pretty sure there is no timing distinction between these two effects when it comes to questing.

His doc clearly says that The Door Is Closed is bad worded and get a different treatment, and it's perfectly logical too, so the doc is still good.

This card effect seems counter to the ruling we just received.

 

Goblin Patrol: Forced: After an enemy is revealed from the encounter deck, discard it instead of adding it to the staging area.

 

The trigger is "After an enemy is revealed", it is not cancellation (at least I don't think so, since it technically since doesn't say "cancel"), and "after it is revealed" according to this ruling will place it in the staging area.  So it will necessarily be in the staging area before the "instead of adding it to the staging area" clause can happen.

 

Obviously, this isn't how the card is supposed to work...and this card shows there is some sort of timing between "after something is revealed" and being "added to the staging area".

Didn't know Immune was in place during the reveal, but good to know. Don't know where I read that, or if I just assumed it. Thanks.

Sometimes I wonder if, when Caleb gets questions pertaining to older cards, he just wants to shout, "This was Nate's card! Blame him!!" ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

We do a lot of hermeneutical, forensic analysis of card text in this subforum, but we mostly seem to submit to designer intent when it comes down to it. I feel reasonably confident that if Caleb was pressed on this particular card, there would be some hand-waving about the word "instead", perhaps a reference to the Golden Rule, and in the end there would be no reversal of the recent ruling.

Not sure about Goblin Follower, heh.

Regarding the Goblin Patrol / Goblin Follower question - isn't it just a question of When before After again? Follower engages the last player, so doesn't go to staging area. So it doesn't trigger the later instead of effect. Of course, if you then played "A Light in the Dark" on the Follower, things could get messier...

My clarification query was re: the Merry-Ithilien Tracker interaction that has been brought up in the past...

> A follow-up on reveal timing, also germane to "after revealed" effects vs "enters staging area" effects... I earlier triggered Ithilien Tracker ("...lower the threat of the next enemy added to the staging area to 0"). An enemy was just revealed. If I now use Merry to reduce my threat ("After an enemy is revealed from the top of the encounter deck, exhaust Merry to reduce your threat by that enemy's threat"), will I get to lower my threat by the enemy's printed threat, or is that threat already lowered to 0?

Answer was consistent with the recent ruling:

> If you use Ithilien Tracker to reduce the threat of the next enemy added to the staging area to 0, then that enemy's threat will be 0 when you trigger Merry's response. Those two players cards simply do not combo together.

Regarding Goblin Follower (absent Goblin Patrol) "when" comes first, so Goblin Follower would engage the last player.  Then "After" he was revealed, he would go to the staging area anyway, and it would be just like his When Revealed effect never happened.  That is, if we go by this Strider's Path ruling.

 

It seems to me Caleb intended to say something to this effect, instead of what was posted by JYoder, but I can't be sure:

 

"After an enemy or location is revealed, it is added to the staging area [unless a card effect caused it to be placed somewhere else first]" (such as the When Revealed effect on Goblin Follower. or the Ambush keyword).

In my opinion this card is obviously a cancel card, it just doesn't say cancel.  That is one of the bad parts about this game, there are so many things that need to be brought in line with current rules.  What this card should read (and I'm certain Caleb would just give this errata if this was brought to his attention) is "Forced: When an enemy is revealed from the encounter deck, cancel it."

I don't think this games needs a LOTR 2.0, I think what this game needs is to admit it's currently LOTR 0.9 and go through the entire current game to proof-read, re-write, and decide consistent and clear rules and release it as a 1.0 patch.  This would be a big project but wouldn't need to tear down anything we already have - just review the wording for how certain effects happen, go back and correct them all.  It could even boost sales as people may want to get the new wording for some of these cards.  I would argue they should also take some of the worthless cards and possibly even re-design them to be less worthless.

 

I doubt they'd do this, but I really don't think we need LOTR 2.0 at this point, this game is still working and expanding.  I just think the errata machine needs to keep grinding, and a better rules doc needs to be designed which gives a clear technical read that brings consistency to the game.

Hey Sappidus, since you have open communication with Caleb regarding this matter, can you ask how you are supposed to resolve Goblin Follower and Ambush?  Considering this ruling, the process would seem to be the following:

 

Goblin Follower (Although, in this example, I don't think the current ruling matters):

1. Resolve Goblin Follower's When Revealed effect (engages last player)

2. After it is revealed, add Goblin Follower to the staging area as a part of the revelation process

 

Ambush keyword

1. Enemy with Ambush is in process of being revealed from the encounter deck

2. When an enemy enters play, it would make an engagement check.

3. Assume it engages a player

4. After it is revealed, add the enemy to the staging area as a part of the revelation process

In this case, an enemy that is revealed from the encounter deck and is about to be added to the staging area is replaced by placing that enemy in the discard pile instead.

That means it was not about to be added to the staging area, which means the replacement effect on stage 2B is not triggered.

If its ‘when revealed’ effect is canceled, then it would be added to the staging area and the forced effect on 2B would discard it instead.

But if effects that take place "after revealed" occur "after it enters the staging area", then there is no effect to replace. By the time Goblin Patrol triggers, the enemy was already in the staging area (just talking about a regular goblin here, not the follower).

Question: With the recent ruling on Strider's Path and ship locations, the card Goblin Patrol seemingly does not work as intended. Goblin Patrol: Forced: After an enemy is revealed from the encounter deck, discard it instead of adding it to the staging area. The Strider's Path ruling seems to indicate the enemy is placed in the staging area before anything can be triggered. If that is the case, the enemy will already be in the staging area before you can trigger the Forced effect on Goblin Patrol. Since it has the clause "instead of adding it to the staging area" there is nothing to replace, because it was already added to the staging area and as a result, the enemy won't get discarded.
 

>  
> 
> The difference between these two effects (Strider’s Path and Goblin Patrol) is subtle but significant. Goblin Patrol is a replacement effect whereas Strider’s Path is not. Because Goblin Patrol uses the language “discard it instead of adding it” that means the enemy never reaches the staging area because it is discarded instead. If Strider’s Path said: “After a location is revealed, immediately travel to it instead of adding it to the staging area” then it would work the same as Goblin Patrol. Sorry for the confusion. I hope that helps.

I don't see how this is so confusing...  but maybe it's because the last game I played seriously had a comprehensive rules write up which defined replacement modifiers, cancel effects, and how these effected timing.  The LoTR rules is a mash up of odd "lead you through a turn" rules which are a bit too light, and then an amalgamation of FAQ / ERRATA which have just collected over the ages.  I said it over a year ago when I first bought this game, and I still say it now - this game needs an official comprehensive rules write up.  If MLP cards has it, then FFG better pony up

Life would be so much easier if all the "After x happens, do something else instead" had been "When x would happen, do something else instead", but this unpleasantness has been with us since at least Frodo Baggins, so we just have to live with it.

Expanding on the thread rather than make new one...

If I play Mariner's Compass, can I select a location from the encounter deck with immune text? (Basically, is a card with immune text still considered immune in this case, when it's not in play or even considered revealed?)

## 42 [NathanH on October 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232426-revealing-and-adding-to-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=2477816)

I wouldn't consider "Immune to Player Card Effects" to be an active effect when a card is not in play, so I would say you can put such a location from the encounter deck into the staging area with Mariner's Compass.

I followed up a bit more regarding replacement effects for clarity.

 

Question: In the FAQ there is an entry "(1.37) Timing of effect resolution".  Recently, cancellation effects were added to that to add some clarity to the timing structure which is really helpful as a player.

Where do replacement effects fall in that timing structure?

 

>  
> 
> Replacement effects and cancellation effects are closely related because they both interrupt something that was about to happen and then change the outcome. In the case of cancellation effects, nothing happens. In the case of replacement effects, something else happens instead. So in that regard, replacement effects could be seen to interrupt the normal resolution of effects the same way that cancellation effects do.
