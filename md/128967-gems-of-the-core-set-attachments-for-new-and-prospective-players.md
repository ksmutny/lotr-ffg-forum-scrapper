In part one [http://www.outpostzero.net/2014/11/lotr-lcg-gems-of-core-set-pt-i-allies.html], I looked at allies from the core set that are awesome on their own, or have become awesome due to the expanded cardpool. I got a lot of great feedback regarding that, and as a result I am focusing this article on cards that only stand on their own two legs. These are cards that were great on day one, and are great now. In either case, the point of these articles is to let new players know that the core set provides many great cards, and isn't completely outmatched by the modern cardpool! Seeing the current catalog of LOTR LCG releases [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=2] can be very daunting, but you don't need to worry! You can contribute to the quest with just one purchase!

I would agree wholeheartedly! when I first purchased the core set these were the four attachments that caught my eye.  also some good descriptions of what the cards do and there potential.
