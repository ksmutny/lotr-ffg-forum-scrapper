GenCon goers get Boromir.  Fellowship event kit's include the Faramir and playmat!

As soon as I saw the artwork, I knew I wanted a play mat of it! Now to convince a store near me to do it.

The same quest for both Gen Con and Fellowship events? Definitely a sign that the game is dying  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Seriously though, time to start figuring out how I'm going to get my hands on a Gen Con copy!

So, I know it says we can have doubles of unique cards across teams, but I'm really tempted to try to build a hero list that keeps them unique across the board.   I'm not going as far as attachments/etc maintaining unique across teams - because I'm only kinda crazy - but keeping the heroes unique seems like a fun challenge.  Is anyone else interested in this discussion/hero building concept or am I the only crazy one here?

I was going to say something similar - this is the first year both the Gen Con and the Fellowship set is the same. Usually we get a different set for each.

It could be fun.  Maybe one table with all Dwarves, one table with all Gondor/Rohan, and one table with all Elves.

> It could be fun.  Maybe one table with all Dwarves, one table with all Gondor/Rohan, and one table with all Elves.

 

Exactly what I was thinking.  Splitting them up by traits makes it a lot more viable.  Each with their own global/trait boosts

 

Boromir (Leadership) + Visionary Leadership

Celeborn and Silvans

Dain and dwarves

 

The Silvans have the weakest stat boosts, so I think maybe one of those players does outlands.

Yea I agree, it's awesome! This box art for fellowship playmat 2016 please!

Anyway, my 2 cents: I really like tactics Eowyn. Opens up new tactics play!

True, I know. I'm not being fair. Everybody in the US can't just go. It's a massive country. Many will have to fly in too.

I meant it more like that at least residents have a fairer shot, not flying from the other ends of the earth and all.

Why don't they just add everything to both events? As it stands gencon players will also have to "buy" the quest twice to get all the goodies. They won't go bankrupt by doing so. And everybody happy.

A collector wants his collection complete. But not for 100+ for a piece of cardboard. =/

Well, you do have to have 3 copies of this quest to play in "epic" mode, so I guess the fact that you get two copies if you attend both GenCon and the Fellowship is not exactly a waste. You could pick up your third copy online through FFG's PoD store.

## 16 [Noccus on July 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225988-siege-of-annuminas-gencon-and-fellowship-event/?do=findComment&comment=2330130)

Yes, but if you play with 3+ players, your game group will most likely bring their own copies right?

Also, I always hear most people play solo only, so they won't need extra copies.

This would work if you play epic mode solo, or your buddies are scrubs ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Oh goodness Im going to buy three copies arent I.

 

I can see me playing solo, 1 handed across three tables having an epic-game weekend playing all three scenarios across the three tables, that will really stretch the available cards in the collection but sounds so epic!

 

Yup, Im going to buy 3 arent I... sheesh

 

 

 

 

Edit: Hmm, good point, if anyone is going to go to 2 events but only wants one pack of cards, Ill buy the other as Ill be getting 3 and giving money to another player is as good as direct to FFG. Im UK based though.

Goddamn I want that playmat..... way way more than either alternative art hero... 

well going to have to wait for overpriced copies from Fellowship events to show up on ebay....

Also can't wait to see this "Lieutentant of Angmar" and the rest of the encounter cards! sounds like a pretty epic quest.

So does everyone who attends any Fellowship event get the mat + Faramir alt, along with a copy of the quest?

Correct, assuming the 2016 Fellowship event is handled the in same manner as the previous two years.

 

All registered attendees for the Fellowship event will receive 1 copy of the alt art Faramir, the play-mat, and the Siege of Annuminas quest. All the products will be distributed by the event coordinator(s). The alt-art card will be enclosed with the quest, probably as the top card.

Wait...all the players at all the tables have to wait for everyone to finish the turn before moving to the next one? So if one person brings a Gandalf deck, EVERYONE THERE HAS TO WAIT FOR THEM?!

Ive occasionally thought that it was amazingly lucky Boromir didnt get a punctured lung with all those arrows sticking in him and was thus able to actualy blow the horn

Since there is a very good picture of alternate art Boromir in this article I wounder: Did they post a picture of alternate art Gimli last year as well? I found one article in the news section announcing the GenCon Quest from 2015 but there was no picture of Gimli in it. Does anyone know or can link an article / picture including alternate art Gimli?

> ...So what happens if you don't have a gameshop nearby that's willing to do this? Can it be purchased individually?

 

They will release the quest itself as POD eventually, but it will not include the alt art card or playmat.  In the past those have been exclusive to the event.

They didn't announce Gimli last year, that I know of.  It was a surprise.

Yes.  Each team is considered to be their own entirely separate game.  Though you do have to take turns at the same time, because of the global effects the encounter deck has during the end of the round.  You don't have to go through the phases at the same time though, so some teams may get done with their turn sooner and have to wait on the others to finish before they can move on.

Pittsburgh, Pa. area LOTR LCG players—I managed to pester Game Masters enough times that they agreed to host the event. It'll be on Nov. 12 at noon. I have NO idea how many kits Phil ordered, but once I find that out I'll follow up. I'm working on posting Facebook, Meetup, etc. event pages for it once I get more info.
