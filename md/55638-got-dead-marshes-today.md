 Very pleased with the card distribution this time around, and absolutely siked about Borimir!  This quest is also very unique in it's own right as it introduces a new escape ability that you must overcome.

More specifically, did you buy it from a local game store, or online, etc?

Yeah, my local gamestore called Gamer's Armory. They are online and they ship internationally. They are awesome and they have plenty Dead Marshes. Enjoy!

Just ordered mine along with the new Warhammer pack. I'm not sure if this was always the case, but it seems nowadays that new packs become available a day or two before FFG makes an official announcement about them.

I got mine tonight in Delaware at my local gaming store called Between Books.

Would you mind scanning a few pictures of the player cards? Just asking, I know not everyone has time for this kind of fun. I have mine ordered but it shall not arrive in at least two weeks.

Yeah... normally I get an email from my Ebay seller a day or two before the official release so that I can Paypal and they can pop my copy into the mail, but I haven't heard from them yet.  **** my impatience!

You play TWO LCGs? How can you even afford that?

Anyhow, someone please spoil me on the quest difficulty! I predict it is greater than five.

I only just got Hills of Emyn Muil yesterday!  I'd fallen behind due to the world shortage of FFG sleeves.  Will be back on track once my retailer gets Dead Marshes in.

Sorry, I won't be scanning any pics in...due to the fact that I don't have a way to do it.  The quest is difficulty 5.  The art is awesome as always in this pack guys.  Though, on one of the cards they managed to paint a bit of cleavage (which seems very un-Tolkien).  I have seen enough cleavage in MTG.

I play Call of Cthulhu, Warhammer Invasion, Lord of the Rings and dabble in Magic. Not that expensive when you consider that the LCG packs are one a month each.

Yeah, I play Warhammer: Invasion and Lord of the Rings and you're looking at $30/month or less typically. It's really not that bad at all. That's like going to see 3 movies a month.

Gave the new adventure a couple of plays last night, and it's very different than the usual game. Get used to at least one additional quest phase (i.e. the escape check), and usually it's better to let your questing remain stagnant than allow Gollum a chance to make a break for the encounter deck.

In our first game we didn't realize this and he escaped. He reappeared a few turns later, though - as a shadow card. He went to the discard pile, and we looked at him laying there, then at the size of our remaining encounter deck, and gave up. Not much fun, and really annoying.

In the second game we boned up on willpower and proxied in some Unexpected Courage. (Yes, proxied, because I'm not dropping $120 just to get four more.) The strategy this time was simply to keep threat as as level as possible and dedicating ourselves to keeping resources off of Gollum. Threat management was made a bit easier by the new Rohan ally - one of those in play kept everything pretty mellow. It was a long game, and we won  - but with four resource tokens on him (due mainly to treachery cards that force additional escape checks), and it was pure luck that the final check of the game passed at all. As luck-driven as this game typically feels, the escape mechanic really exacerbates it. And the new cards - the Worm and the Bog in particular - will not leave play for anything.

The player cards are generally very good. Boromir is an utter beast, trading 2-3 threat to block and destroy most enemies (in other words, "The Galadrhim's Greeting"  is now effective multi-creature removal). Enhanced with a few signal attachments, he makes you feel downright invincible. The leadership cards might be the weakest of the bunch, though they may benefit a mono deck.

I just got mine today, but I havn't tried it out just yet. I do love the new player cards though. Going to make a new deck or two and try it sometime later. Took forever to sleeve the cards, so I'm kind of pooped (I had 1 packet of 50 Mayday Predmium sleeves "too tight" that started to bend my cards, had to throw those sleeves out... Even though that was my replacement pack I got for free, I'm not happy with the quality, it's very inconsistent. OT: How are the FF sleeves?)

The FFG sleeves feel very high quality, but they aren't as "tight fitting" as they probably could be.  All the same, they feel snug and run no risk whatsoever of damaging the cards from being too tight - they also fit well in Ultra Pro deck boxes, although the sleeves are very thick, taking up considerable space when you sleeve a lot of cards for storage, etc.  In using 11 packages worth so far, I've only noticed one sleeve with a small imperfection, something that looked like a "scar" in the plastic on the front, but it isn't extremely noticeable and I haven't had any split.  I'll be picking up another 10 packs soon, I'm a fan.

I'll try them out then, I don't mind if they're not exactly tight fitting, it's much better than too tight. I think I bought 10 Mayday Premium packs and 3 of those were bad, the 3 replacements were even worse (I had to throw out over 50 of those sleeves for being too tight). So yeah, FF sleeves for me it seems. Thanks. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Because I'm a bored millionaire who has nothing to do but play cards in between my trips around the world, parties and dating of beautiful women. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

But seriously, it's less than $26 dollars a month and that includes expedited shipping. You don't have to be a big spender to be able to afford it, though I do understand that people have different obligations with their money. For me, it's more of an issue to have enough time to keep up with both properly. As it is, I think I play far fewer games than a lot of people here. This is probably one of the major reasons I won't play the Star Wars game. Just not enough time for it all.

What I like:

- quest is once again much different and some old strategies do not work anymore. You can't commit best questers, because they have to guard gollum and you will fail the quest quite a lot of times, so threat may become a problem (35+ cards start to work). It is quite hard to keep gollum on the board, but it is manageable. Still, I love the challenge and I like the quest so far

What I dislike:

- when gollum escapes, in my opinion player should lose the game. However, gollum is shuffled into the deck instead. And when it happens, it may take forever to see him again and you can ignore most quest mechanics / new cards. Stalling decks like Beravor + Courage can play for hours and will not lose against this quest (but the score will be ugly).

It's difficulty 5, but it feels more like a 4. If you have Protector of Lorien/Eowyn, card drawing engine/The Galadhrim's Greeting, you'll pretty much never have to worry about the Escape checks.

The new enemy Worm monster's ability to heal itself by 2 after every round isn't so bad if you have anything that can deal decent damage. It has 3 Attack, 2 Defense and 6 HP, so it's not that scary.

Basically, The Dead Marshes is too easy. I'm sure you will agree.

I dont understand........ They give us more and more better players cards to make better deck and after give us more easy quests.... Where the logic???

They give us lot of attachments and there is no any encounter card can discard attachments since core set......

I even dont know what to say......

Did you see the preview of the Orc Raiders? They're not in Dead Marshes, but forcing players to discard two attachments seems pretty nasty to me.

Oh really? So you have spare 6 will power to guard gollum every turn? Eowyn herself is not enough (4 is less than 6) and discarding a card every turn (5 may not be enough as some escape values = 5 and you have to beat the number) can be a real pain. And protector of lorien? Do you know that you can't make an action once the escape card is drawn? You have to activate abilities before you see the escape check value.

Of course, guarding gollum gets easier after a few turns, when you have bunch of allies or your favorite combos in play etc. But before it happens, gollum will probably have some resources.

Yeah, I knew that. We didn't use Protector of Lorien for Gollum. Just for that annoying Unpassable Bog or whatever it's called with Quest Points of 12. That's probably the most powerful card in the set. Gives you 7 Victory Points too if you explore it, which is nice.

Something did bother me though, because I wasn't entirely sure of the answer. Do you still need to perform escape tests if Gollum is not in play?

## 34 [guciomir on November 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=552060)

I think you need to perform escape checks when treachery cards tell you to do it (you can still suffer additional effect). But no more escape tests every turn as per gollum card.

About the player cards:

Small eagle is great, I like it as much as leadership scout

Observer is also nice, my deck was missing some good leadership allies and this one is versatile

Elfhelm rocks, he has same stats as tracker but serves different purpose. His ability will trigger quite often and the best time is when you have some constant effect that raises your threat. For example in carrock, when all trolls engage you do not get +12 threat, but just +8.

Yes yes you right new cards is good.

But situation more and more funny: we already can win Carrock and other quests quite easy so now we have more cards to win even  more effective. So according this logic soon we will have a player decks which ones can win all quests(exclude Osgiliath) without any problem cose 2 last new quest is more easy than previous. So we get less and less challenge right??? But game without challenge still fun??? I just didn understand where we going?!

You are repeating yourself all the time and just make people angry (not because of what you say, but because you write the same words 5 times per day).

You can't have 50% win rate against every quest with the same solo deck.  The one you shown here in forums (glorfindel) was good against SOME quests, but really sucked against the rest quests.

And just don't say that you are right because you are good player (like you did plenty of times), this sounds like a boasting of 5 year old kid.

Finally, Hills and Marshes are harder in my opinion solo if you compare them to Carrock or Hunt For Gollum. I do not remember losing against Carrock , well, I did once when 1st turn snake killed my hero and another time when just everything went wrong, but this was some weeks ago. Today I won a game with 1st turn hero being sacked. Hell, I did not lose against Gollum quest ever. While I did lose a couple of times against Hills (nasty treacheries) and against Marshes (I have a house rule - gollum escapes - player is defeated).

If you dont like what i say dont need to answer ok??? Just ignore me.

About win and lose. I didnt lose any game i mena coop game already 2 months or somethings. Yes some solo game still lose sometimes. Actually i dont care anymore cose i already dont spend to much time with this game than before and most of my friends too. Cose is boring to win all the time.

Is not easy to leave something what you do every day for last 6 months.  But its happen by the way. We dont gather every week anymore cose only 1 quest which is interesting is Osgiliaht(but you cannot play 1 quest all the time), nightmare mode is really shame fo designers and new quests is not worse to gather to play together(boring and easy). So my attempt to bulid up players community in my city fail cose other card games give more opportunity for players.Some players already switch to AGOT and other games.

So for now is not much things to do there is no events or somethings to bring new players. Just wait until tournaments system and see what happen then. And Khazad-dum also sure!!

One can always try to build nice thematic decks. You know, not always the best cards fitting into a deck from the winning potential view but those that shall flavour the deck best. I think that could result in some sound thrashings against some quests and perhaps more of a satisfactory feeling when things go well.

## 41 [gatharion on November 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=552736)

 Yeah, I've suggested that before.

I play with theme decks and only one core set and I find the game plenty challenging.

I guess the game can be "broken". I'm just as happy that it's not harder, I've no interest in buying three core sets and finding the maximumly efficient set of cards possible to pwn the game.

He also mentioned playing with friends, plural. If you're playing three/four player games then that's also going to go a long way towards making the game "too easy".

Or make your own quests, since you know better than Nate French. There's a card creator program somewhere on the internet (I'm sure the link's on these forums somewhere). With your God-like level of expertise about the Lord of the Rings the Card Game, I'm sure you could come up with something great.

In Glaurung's defense, not everyone wants to play with thematic decks. Ideally, the game should give you a challenge even if you prefer playing with the higher end decks. In all honesty, it hasn't been doing that, lately. This continues to be the toughest challenge the developers have, to make the game interesting and challenging for both top tier decks and more casual decks. It just isn't easy to do. Personally, I'm not convinced that this game will do well outside of a more casual environment.

You mean you suffer the same problem, winning easy all the time with your best decks? As self-confident as it may sound, I think I have made some very powerful decks but I have never come to a point that I would feel the game cannot surprise me (or beat me). Maybe it is just me, but I am rather glad when things go well, of course I like challenge, it is just I am getting it in fair share, I feel.

Bottom line, I was not trying to attack, I was genuinly trying to advice.

I never feel that the game cannot beat me, but outside of Rhosgobel, I don't find any of the other scenarios that difficult. I have all of one loss against Gollum and Emyn Muil combined. I didn't even play Emyn Muil that much because it simply wasn't very interesting. And once you've played  a scenario a few times and you've seen the quest cards and encounter deck, how much can it surprise you? You know everything that's in there already. Please do not think that I'm trying to sound like I'm better than anyone else, because I'll be the first to tell you I'm not. But I don't care too much for putting together a deck that will be less competitive against a scenario simply because it is thematic. I prefer to use the best tools I'm given.

Thanks Titan for you support and understand. Yes maybe you right this game will never come to the same level as AGOT or Magic OR LOTR TCG Decipher.

And this make me feel really sad. But ok hope is still there. Will see....

 About Designers:  They try to do nightmare mode for players who is already want more challenge. But nightmare mode is a joke in the end of the day  even after second rules changing. Who try it they know what  im talking about.

Any game in my opinion should go from easy to hard. This is logic right???

 But in this game is more cards we have with more Adv. packs release more better we can build up the players decks and this is right. If you remember the first decks build up only from core set and compare them to current decks, they are much more weaker. So our players decks now is much more stronger much more!!! And According by logic the quests and encounter decks should be also grow up.Cose we can deal with them even without the new players cards.

But what about with encounter decks and quests from Adv packs??Some of them even more easy then core set quests!!! Dol-Guldor is for sure more interesting and challenge then Carrock and Anduin is more hard then  then HFG and HOEM.  So I really  happy we have a brilliant Osgiliaht which ine is show : yes they know how to make a good quest. In my opinion the first quest since core set which is good. Can you image if we have all the quests in Cycle like this???Wow!!! And i didn talk only about hard level but also whole level of the quest is really example of good job on any aspect(including story and so on) . And only this still give me hope every think can be ok( in my opinion of course cose most if the players is happy already).

Cheers.

Also i happy to practice my Engilsh typing. Thanks a lot for that too!!!!

Game difficulty hasn't been much of an issue for me yet, as I am still learning and tweaking my decks (and waiting for my second core set =P), so I'm still enjoying my little struggle (Anduin is hard!).  But I can understand that with the most efficient or "minimaxed" decks, such as a Beravor draw deck, the game loses its flavor if it is never challenging.

I think part of the problem is the model of the using encounter sets from the core set in the scenarios for the APs.  Since the scenarios from the APs utilize the encounter sets from the core set, how could it be that much harder than the core set quests, such as Anduin, if half of the deck is constructed from the same subset of cards?  Sure, the designers can utilize new mechanics and nastier treacheries with the new encounter sets from the APs, but unless the encounter deck is self-contained (i.e. Massing at Osgiliath), they are still limited in what they are able to accomplish.  Meanwhile, the player decks become increasingly versatile... I think players like Massing at Osgiliath because of the synergy of the encounter deck (which also fits in thematically for the players more interested in the immersive aspect), which is harder to achieve when you are reusing encounter cards.

Hey Romance but this is a really good spot!!! I think you absolutely right about about core encounter decks. Yes this is the different with Osgiliath quest.

And you know what??? They will give us 9 Encounter sets in Khazad-dum box which ones we will use in next cycle. And that how they can make next cycle more challenge and different to each other to add to those 9 encounter sets one more by every new Adv. packs. Really really exiting!!!!  So it mean we will have much more challenge with another 9+6=15 encounter sets.Sounds cool!!!

Emyn Muil can be brutal sometimes. Sure, I got a sequence of flawless victories when the encounter deck was not really trying to beat me. But from time to time, the treacheries can hit really hard or if a few first cards are nasty, the game can change from easy to medium or even hard. Some people would just say "bad luck, my deck is still invincible and I just lost because of pure misfortune" . But statistically speaking, in most cases this is not a misfortune, but rather a trend. Which means , the deck can be improved , so the odds are better.

Gollum quest is way too easy for solo player (as most of us design decks targeted at quest/threat/location control). Carrock also seems easy, but sometimes, when you get him by 1st/2nd turn sacked or 1st turn deadly snake who kills your hero... All I can say that I really love those games, when the sacked is first or second card - I won 2 out of 3 of such games, but it was very close and the games were very fun.

I also disagree that the old quests are not changing. Think about Rhosgobel. My deck was absolutely hopeless against Rhosgobel, so I had to change Gimli to Legolas and I also added 3x Radagast to the deck. As a result, I have a chance against Rhosgobel (small, but much bigger than before). And, most importantly, some old quests got harder as Gimli was a better fighter in my deck and also Radagast is rather poor ally.

We have 1 adventure pack left. If it is fight oriented (and I really hope it will be) , most top tier decks who focus on quest/threat/location control will have to adjust so they can handle this new quest. As a result, they will lose some edge over old quests.

## 51 [Titan on November 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=553094)

I don't think any deck is invincible. And you are right, given the right combination of nasty cards, any quest can hammer you. Heck, I've lost against the introductory quest in a few turns, when all the big nasties came out one after the other. But I disagree that those type of occurences present a trend. If you draw 2 Signs of Gollum and 2 Hunters from Mordor in a row, for example, you are in big trouble, but how often will that happen? It is not a trend, it's an exception. 

As for Rhosgobel, the quest didn't change. What changed was your deck and thus, it's ability to handle the quest's obstacles. Things like this might make a quest easier or harder, but it has nothing to do with the quest itself. It's all about the player's deck.

## 52 [guciomir on November 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=553105)

Yeah, I could probably phrase it differently as "the quest does not change, but the experience/adventure feels different and the quest may change it's relative difficulty".

Obviously there is a line between a trend and an exception. I feel quite a lot of players don't really know if they spotted a trend or exception. They for example play 4 games, win 3 and lose 1. And during this one lost game, encounter deck pulled off something deadly. You can't really say "I won all normal games and lost once due to incredible bad luck", the sample is just too low to derive any statistics. In some games (like Emyn Muil), encounter deck does not make suprises in just 1% of the games like some people think, but the percentage is actually much higher and is noticable in my opinion.

 

## 53 [lleimmoen on November 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55638-got-dead-marshes-today/?do=findComment&comment=553160)

I really agree with the above. Unless I would specificaly deck-build for a quest, I think the element of surprise is quite substantial. It may sometimes seem as an incredibly bad luck but it tends to happen quite often, if that makes any sense.

Hear, hear.

A lot of the criticism I hear (though not Glaurung's, as he seems to play a lot) is from people who take a new quest, build a deck for it, beat it twice in a row and declare it to be 'too easy'.

Emyn Muil for example can be a walk in the park for a Rohan deck if there's a steady flow of locations. At the same time, such a deck receiving two Beastmasters in a row will be in big trouble. However, the general sentiment then is "That was really bad luck, we know the scenario is location heavy but the encounter deck only dealt me enemies, boo hoo". It's not bad luck, it's a feature of that quest that is not the most likely to be dominant, but that will inevitably pop up every now and then. If your deck fails against it, it undermines any claims of being able to win 'consistently' against the scenario and it by extension being too easy.

I completely disagree about restricting Gandalf because such a rule totally goes against his character and how often he shows up in Middle-Earth. Gandalf is supposed to just "show up" unexpectedly now and then, and having three copies makes sure this type of thing happens.  I agree he is EXTREMELY powerful, but he is supposed to be...he is one of Aluvitar's angels.

Don't have DM yet, so have to ask, is there anything negative/positive about failing or passing those escape tests IF Gollum is not in play? Do the escape test cards have other negative effects besides just adding tokens to Gollum?

I think they were just talking about Gandalf in terms of its gameplay balance, and not in terms of representing the character from the lore.  With regards to that issue of balance, I think there's a distinction between being a strong card and being a card that overwhelmingly breaks the mechanics of the game (perhaps because of its interaction with other cards).

I basically agree, but I also have to say that in combination with Born Aloft, Second Breakfast and Erebor Hammersmith I am able to play him eleven times. And Bilbo makes sure that I will draw my whole deck before I finished the game. Additionally one could call him three times with Sneak Attack.

That's a bit ridiculous, so I decided not to use Second Breakfast and Sneak Attack. So Gandalf himself might not be gamebreaking, but in combination with other cards he's just too powerful.

We know that they test the entire AP cycle before even the first one is released, but what about the number of core sets? Would it be safe to assume that they test the encounter decks with just one core set per player (or per 2 players?)? If that's the case, perhaps extra core sets tip the balance too much in the player's favor? I wonder if the restricted list (if it comes of course) is only one core set allowed in tournaments? *ponders*

We know that they test the entire AP cycle before even the first one is released, but what about the number of core sets? Would it be safe to assume that they test the encounter decks with just one core set per player (or per 2 players?)? If that's the case, perhaps extra core sets tip the balance too much in the player's favor? I wonder if the restricted list (if it comes of course) is only one core set allowed in tournaments? *ponders*



If you look of the results of they testing is not really good......... They already change the rules of the game 3 times for 6 months. And the first errata was done (Nazgul of Dol-Guldor)  was done after 1 month game release.+ scoring system  didn work and nightmare mode too.

So the best testers we are. Players. Now we are really testing the game!!!!

That people was smart who say 6 months ago : no no i will wait about 1 year and then will see what happen. For now is to fresh and need some update.

So actually we have a big testing for all period of Shadow of Mirkwood. Im ok with that. Just hope next cycle will be more balanced, quests and encounter cards more interesting and difficult and new mechanics make players decks more different to each other.

Just picked up my copy of Dead Marshes tonight. Silvan Tracker looks like a handy little tanking ally. Really like the artwork in this pack.

Now that all four Sphere songs have been released, I have some crazy deck building to do. Quad Sphere: Activate!



Yes, go for it. Quad sphere decks are just cool. They're not always hugely effective, but I've got some good solo wins with quad-sphere decks, including this monster of a win at the Carrock [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/720855/a-worthwhile-evening-of-soloing-the-new-scoring-sy]

I never feel that the game cannot beat me, but outside of Rhosgobel, I don't find any of the other scenarios that difficult. I have all of one loss against Gollum and Emyn Muil combined. I didn't even play Emyn Muil that much because it simply wasn't very interesting. And once you've played  a scenario a few times and you've seen the quest cards and encounter deck, how much can it surprise you? You know everything that's in there already. Please do not think that I'm trying to sound like I'm better than anyone else, because I'll be the first to tell you I'm not. But I don't care too much for putting together a deck that will be less competitive against a scenario simply because it is thematic. I prefer to use the best tools I'm given. 

 

 

I'm just curious, do you find Rhosgobel to be more challenging than Massing at Osgiliath? and if so, why?




 

I have not played against Osgiliath. From what I understand, it is far more difficult. My comment was made in reference to the cycle's quests. My apologies if that wasn't made clear.

@ClydeCloggie If I beat Emyn Muil most of the times, but end up with a bad draw "every now and then" which causes me to lose, I'm I not still beating it consistently? This is just once again the case of the extreme scenario, which can happen at any point, but very rarely will. This does not mean, however that the scenario is all that difficult, simply that it is capable of getting a tough draw that will overcome any deck. This is a reality for all scenarios, regardless of difficulty. Consistency does not mean that a deck is perfect and will handle every given scenario without breaking a sweat, only that it can win most of the time.

I see a difference of opinion between those that build different "thematic" decks to go against the same scenario and those who just play the best deck suitable. There is nothing wrong with either approach, you play the game as you see fit. But understand this: a quest cannot be judged against anything but the best decks that can go against it. Judge it against your best decks, not against all your decks. You cannot judge it against lesser decks and say "it's not that easy". That's like riding a bicycle, instead of a car, to work and saying that it takes a long time to get there.

Yeah, perhaps I don't play enough to notice it, but Gandalf is hardly ever the make or break of my games.  I still don't think he is "too good."    

I basically agree, but I also have to say that in combination with Born Aloft, Second Breakfast and Erebor Hammersmith I am able to play him eleven times. And Bilbo makes sure that I will draw my whole deck before I finished the game. Additionally one could call him three times with Sneak Attack.



This combo you described would cost 64 resources and spreads across three different spheres. Even with Steward of Gondor this would take you over 12 turns of playing nothing else. I wouldn't say this is broken.

Back to the original topic I have enjoyed this round of player cards. I just got my pack and haven't actually gone through the quest yet, but I already see a lot of utility for previous quests and hopefully future ones as well. I am a theme deck builder myself and having another Eagle with a strong attack ability will make my creature deck more viable, especially for cost of 1. I will also be using Song of Mocking on Frodo in my Tactics/Spirit deck.

Gandalf costs 5 resources each round, Steward of Gondor supplies you with 5 resources. Each Gandalf played helps you to reduce your threat, and thus gives you additional time to collect resources to play other stuff beside Gandalf. If you have Mistress of Rivendell and Song of Kings plus Bilbo you can play leadership resources very early in the game without havinga a leadership hero - usually. One reason why I'm happy about the new scoring system, is that a deck like this needs a lot of time to finish the game, so you might win the game, but get a bad result in the end. If you don't care abour scoring though, it still doesn't matter how long it takes before you defeat a scenario.

What I wanted to say is that Gandalf himself is not broken, especially because of his costs (like you pointed out), but that a game can get very dull if you're able to play Gandalf 10 times in a row.

 I'm still not convinced that it would work. Not reliably. It requires drawing some very specific cards in your opening hand and even with them you''ve got to be spending some time setting yourself up and hoping to draw those Gandalfs. I play with Bilbo a lot, he's great but there is no guarantee that you'll be getting the card you need (at least not in the right order). Plus while you're focused on being able to pull off multiple Gandalfs, you won't be playing other allies and the encounter deck will keep pouring on enemies and the like.

I assumed this was the case, but I just wanted to be sure.



We will house rule that if Gollum is not in the staging area and you are required to make an escape test (because of a treachery etc) we can search the encounter deck and the discard pile for Gollum and put him into the staging area. Otherwise the chance for him to get discarded as a shadow card or escape test card is too high and the game session degenerates into frustration. Else there is no sense to force players to take an escape test...

Additionally we will reset the quest to stage 1b if Gollum is not in the staging area during 2b

Somehow this quest feels that it has a couple of major game mechanic flaws...

Or, the easiest solution: If Gollum leaves the staging area at any point of the game, you lose.

First of all, if you have 3 Gandalfs in your deck, it's roughly a 60% chance that you draw him in your starting hand (assuming you mulligan if you don't draw him on the first draw).  Luckily, "Stand and Fight" is no longer an issue thanks to the errata, but I don't think it is that difficult to have both Gandalf and Sneak Attacks -- have you seen any of the draw decks (hello Beravor + UC)?  I'm not saying that in every situation and with every deck that you'll always be able to play multiple Gandalfs, and I'm not saying that you should or have to play a certain way in order to win.  Personally, I don't find playing Gandalf every turn that exciting (and it also ruins the thematic idea of Gandalf appearing, doing something great, then disappearing, which others have stated they liked =P).  Rather, my point is that if your deck is structured in a certain manner it is possible to greatly increase the likelihood of abuse, and if we're talking about balance then we have to consider the most extreme cases and the most efficient decks.  I am also not claiming that the Gandalf card in and of itself is the root of the cause of the problem, because it isn't -- but it is possible to consistently play him multiple times in a game.

Is sneak attack more a problem than Gandalf?How about banning sneak and releasing similar card with higher cost.. (or errata 2 cost sneak or 3 cost sneak would be much less likely to be include in the deck...) Even 3 cost sneak is better that 5 cost gandalf, but so little that it would newer be playd (one extra card, for 2 point price reduction...) Is cost 2 too little to make any difference... Maybe... One would be that Gandalf would be immune to player card effect so you can not use sneak or any other player cards to Gandalf... He is a Maia after all :-) (like nazgul is immune to conditions)

The idea of having steward costin 1 and producing 1 is actually guite good. It would still be very powerful, but not ultimately so.

Well, Sneak Attack has particularly good synergy with Gandalf because Gandalf normally costs 5 resources AND he has ridiculous after "entering play" options and benefits.  But yeah, UC, SoG... game breaking cards.

While I don't agree with the idea that the Gandalf/Sneak Attack combo is too powerful, banning either card would be overkill. This is precisely the kind of situation what a restricted list is for: Put both cards on a Restricted List and you cannot have both cards in a deck.

Having either card in a deck without the other isn't a problem or is it?

DurinIII said:

yes, that is true. it should have the same limitation as "Stand and Fight" regarding the sphere of influence.

Regarding the difficulty:

Recieved DM yesterday played round of that new pack. It was a piece of cake..honestly. Ok, we were lucky. I played with Eowen and all rohan cards, Gloin (who did not earn even one ressource due to lack of enemies) and Dunhere. I drew the Steward and protector at the beginning and got some good allies out as well. My partner got a ton of allies in her Lore (Bilbo, Elanor,) and tactics (Boromir) deck. We did not struggle one time and beat the quest without even resetting the quest stage or loosing Gollum.

A bit dissapointing, but good luck really on the the other hand. We also got a lot of cards out because of Bilbo and Elanor. I still like then new escape mechanic

We were  trying to beat Osigiath i guess 4 times or so until we finally manged  to!  It is horribly difficult and so far it was the one we struggled the most. You have to draw a Gandalf for instance to win and or other wise be extremely lucky with card draw and encouter deck. So far, Osgiliath and Carrock and maybe Dol Gundor are imo the most challenging quests and the ones that i feeled that my 13€ were worth paying for the quest. Ok, fair enough, you still get player cards with the super easy quests like Hills or DM now, but still. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] a bit dissapointing. I belong to the ones that really play for a the challenge and not just for "theme" or so. Sure, i love LotR and Tolkien, but if I want to have great story, i ready a book normally. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] So far, the "story" told in the adventure packs has really been very simple and not epic at all as well.

Now, lets just hope that from the next expansion on the game will really start to get more and more difficult.

I don't want to take side and divert this into a black and while discussion. For instance  what we do is to use only one Gandalf normally  and we play with one core, two players. In the future, if an adventure pack will have a difficulty less than 6 or 7, I will not use UC or Steward in my deck for sure from the first play on.

We were have enough easy quests and soon a complete easy adventure cycle (I speak about 1 core, 2 players, 1 Gandalf...) so please let the next ones be really tough! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'll agree with Shelfwear here... It's not that I don't like a challenge, and it IS a challenge to get Gollum out in Staging again, believe me. It's just that I don't like a BORING challenge.

Cycling through the Encouterdeck over and over again, dragging the game out for HOURS! is not my idea of fun.

So we have opted to use your last alternative here Shelfwear, i.e. If Gollum goes back into the Deck, we stop playing and count it as a loss, because no one in our group want to sit there waiting for the slim chance of him coming back up again.

I've played Dead Marshes three times (all solo). I had two wins and a loss. The loss was me just giving up after Gollum went back into the Encounter Deck; I had things to do and wasn't just going to hang around waiting for the little bugger to turn up again.

 So.

I was playing a three person game against the Dead Marshes last night. Between questing and escape tests, with three players we were going through the encounter deck pretty fast. We were close to completing the first stage of the quest and there were only three cards left in the encounter deck. Gollum had 4 resource tokens and we just drew the Treachery card that puts two more on him (reduced to 1 if a Lore character gets exhausted) and we hit upon the realization...if we let Gollum take the two tokens and then purposefully lose the escape test then he'll get put back into the scant encounter deck and then get drawn next turn and be devoid of resource tokens.

I couldn't see anything that prevented this from being a valid loophole.

I suppose there was some risk that on the next turn we could have drawn a Treachery card asking for an Escape test, but since I was using Elenore, even the risk of that occurring was mitigated.
