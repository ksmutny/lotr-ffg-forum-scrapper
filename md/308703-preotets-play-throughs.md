## 1 [Preotet on May 26, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3944633)

I found out I quite enjoy doing these little "battle reports", so I decided I'll send my 3 Hunters across the vast and rich land of adventures we've got available in this brilliant game. And maybe for some, it will be a fun and interesting read. I know many know these quests by heart, however, I have decided to attach stats and text to every card, except for player cards. Some folk might need to refresh their memory, some don't know the cards so well, or are completely new to the game. And there will be no unreleased material here. Which will be an obsolete statement in a few months. 😄

Well, on with the show.

These are nice.

Just in the beginning, Local Trouble goes on the highest threat cost hero, I believe, so it should not have been Glorfindel.

## 3 [Preotet on May 27, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3944871)

Oh, bummer. Gotta read the cards more thoroughly. Thanks for pointing that out. I would've ended up with 47 threat instead of 39, if I had put Local Trouble on Gandalf.

## 4 [lleimmoen on May 27, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3944872)

Well, you do an amazing job reporting with such clarity, no wonder a mistake might creep in whilst doing that.

## 5 [Adaepholn on May 27, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3944879)

This is great! Very clear and well formatted. I look forward to seeing more!

I tried something similar a couple of times, but I found it painfully slow to record while playing 2-handed. I did pick possibly one of the worst scenarios to try first, in terms of expected game length; Flight from Moria. (I also tried The Seventh Level which was faster, but probably took me around 2 and 1/2 hours instead of about 1 hour to play. I think Flight from Moria took me about 4 hours while recording it in detail, but it was a 13 round game that I played in 2 sessions)

 

How much longer do you think this took you than it would have done to play without recording it in detail?

(Perhaps you record all your scenarios to this level, in which case ignore the question)

I actually do record my plays. Then I go through the recording and just describe what is happening on the board. I haven't the equipment or the confidence to do YT or Twitch videos, so this kind of format suits me just fine. 😄

I too wondered about that, and guessed right. That seems like a good way, and it certainly is a good read. I did, a long time ago, enjoyed a video or two, but I have to say for every good one there were (are) many unwatchable (for me) ones. But I understand people have different tastes, of course.

## 9 [Preotet on May 27, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3944905)

I decided that after the fact approach is the best for me, otherwise I would be constantly interrupting the flow of the game and probably forgetting even more stuff.

I really enjoyed the report on Ithilien. It has been years since I played it (in 2013). It wasn’t a nightmare version then, of course, yet I still took great pride in beating it with the cardpool of then. And here you are still using Glorfindel as I did, and I really wonder why some seem to shy away from him because I find him to be among the best heroes in the game, probably my favourite, though I would also like to see another version (Tactics) with a great ability (would be even better now with Thorongil). The ally is also amazing but the Lore version...

## 12 [Preotet on May 31, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947156)

As I've gathered from reading the forums and listening to some podcasts, he was overplayed. He's powerful and cheap for his stats and was therefore in every deck. That's why players shied away from him. Then came new characters, new combos, new jank. Anyway, that's just the feeling I got, so I could be wrong. But I'm still new to the game so I don't find him boring yet. 😃

The funny thing about Into Ithilien, I always thought it was the easiest of the three and never had any real big problems with beating it. Well, at first I did, because of my limited cardpool. But at that time, the majority of the quests seemed difficult. I only played Escape from Dol Goldur for the first time a couple of months ago, for example. It gained such a reputation it was almost the last quest I played (not counting unreleased packs from the last cycle).

## 13 [Preotet on May 31, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947158)

And I agree, he's one of the best heroes in the game. Right there beside Eowyn and Gandalf. 😃😃

## 14 [lleimmoen on June 1, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947377)

I always found it hard but not as annoying as some. I think Pelargir is easier but can get some really nasty combos. Ithilien basically had the Wargs and the Watcher that could destroy the swarms of the time but I hardly ever swarmed. Then Wargs got the positive errata I believe, and it changed things a little bit.

## 15 [Preotet on June 1, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947393)

Oh the Wargs. Ruined plenty of promising games. What kind of errata did they get?

## 16 [Adaepholn on June 1, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947436)

I believe they used to have a conditional reshuffle: "If the current quest has the battle or siege keyword, shuffle this card back into the encounter deck", which was completely removed in the errata.

I've only ever played with the post-errata version which is punishing enough, so having to shuffle them back into the deck and potentially draw them again sounds awful. I also think this could create a loop, where if the only cards left in the deck were Blocking Wargs you would just endlessly reveal and reshuffle them, while also killing all non-immune questing characters.

## 17 [lleimmoen on June 1, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308703-preotets-play-throughs/?do=findComment&comment=3947437)

I believe originally you shuffled them back to the encounter deck right after reveal and now you don’t any longer but I am by no means certain by this.

Let us talk some of the heroes as I used to in the past but have not done so in years.

I really like the design of Gandalf but I have not built that many good decks with him as others seem to achieve. I do not always shy away from higher threat lineups but the only good decks I ever had with Gandalf ran either Spirit Beregond or Glorfindel.

I find it interesting that the original Eowyn and Beregond were both staple heroes already but received new versions (in opposite sphere) in the Flame of the West which are even much better I would say. Yes, perhaps not always that much better but in general definitely more versatile: low threat cost in Tactics with high willpower is amazing and keeping the threat level (as Beregond usually does) is great too.

I believe what people dislike about Spirit Glorfindel is the lack of positive ability. And I do agree that such a major character, or such an iconic character, and certainly one of the mightiest of the era, should have a card with a mighty ability (and stats... which seem fine as they are). But as I said earlier, I really enjoy the Spirit version, I just wish we would have another powerful version, and the Lore one is a total miss.

Hey, we seemed to have write it simultaneously, ok, so they probably shuffled when the stage was a battle or siege, makes sense. It indeed could leave a few of them at the bottom of the encounter deck and you were stuck.
