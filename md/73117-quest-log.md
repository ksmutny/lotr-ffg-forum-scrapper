 I use it.  I don't really find any of the statistics that it records useful -- I made my own excel spreadsheet to track win% and things I care about.  But I do use the FFG's quest log to record comments about the quest.  Sometimes it's a laugh to look back and see what I wrote about a particularly hard game.

I use the log, though i'm not quite sure why…

I really don't like it. In fact I've always hated it. Just the fact that you can only select one hero is retarded imo…

You can select up to 3 heroes.  You can only select heroes for one player, though.

I've never actually kept track of score in this game.  I almost always play co-op with the woman, so it never seemed to matter.  If we lose we just switch tactics or decks until we don't lose.  That might change if they ever do any kind of events.

 i wish one day they will add any achievments or so. Like beat whole cycle in nightmare mode or so. Would be awesome.

I used to use the Log but I gave up. Doesn't really matter in the end

My playing partners and I use the log for keeping track of all the won games. We have logged all of them. I also use the log to keep track of which heroes are underused and which we tend to use all the time.

For multiplayer games we just note in the comments field who we played with. When all the players do that, we can retrieve a total record of the played multiplayer games if we wish to by logging into all the accounts and find the game.

I think it is a great tool that could be made even better but probably won't.

When I tried it, the first weeks it came out, you could only select one. So I just stopped using it…
