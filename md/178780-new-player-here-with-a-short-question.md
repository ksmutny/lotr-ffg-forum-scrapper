I'm very new to the Lord of the Rings LCG, but so far, I love it. 

 

I've collected the first adventure cycle (the Mirkwood ones), but I see there are Saga Expansions available. Are these compatible with regular play, or are the Saga Expansions special, and only to be played by themselves? 

 

Cheers, 

 

Eirik

they are played the exact same way as the rest of the game, the only difference being that they are quests taken straight from tolkien. the two hobbit saga boxes cover the first and second half of the hobbit, and the three lord of the rings saga we have cover the fellowship and half the two towers.  you get player cards like you do in normal boxes.  The only other difference is that the sagas have things you can unlock.  the hobbits have treasures you find in the troll camp and in Erebor and the lord of the rings have boons (which are good) and burdens (which are bad) which you unlock as you go through.  when you unlock at treasure, boon or burden with a certain set of heroes, they are unlock forever, but if you play a quest after you would have unlock the treasures without unlocking them with your heroes before hand you just have to do without.

Ah, thanks for the info. I'm going to collect all of the expansions in due time.

 

Love the game. Only wish I knew someone to play it with (I live in Oslo, Norway, and they all play Android here :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )

As SauronTheGreat mentioned, the Saga Boxes cover material from the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit. The scenarios in these boxes can be played sequentially to take the player(s) through Tolkien's books. These scenarios are independent of the adventure cycles, but players are free to use almost all the cards they wish in the decks they play against these scenarios. The only cards that are not allowed are unique cards of the same name that are in the Saga boxes. For instance you cannot use the Lore Bilbo Baggins hero when playing The Hobbit Saga boxes as a separate Bilbo Baggins is used in that Saga box. Likewise, Frodo Baggins for the Lord of the Rings Saga boxes.

 

As I recently wrote in another thread, the Saga Boxes are very, very highly regarded by the LOTR:LCG community. Most players would encourage fellow players to pick them up. The Trilogy Saga boxes, in particular, are really well done IMHO. The currently available Saga boxes are:

 

1) The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill, 3 Scenarios (takes the players from Bag End through the Riddle Game with Gollum)

2) The Hobbit: On the Doorstep, 3 Scenarios (takes the players from Mirkwood to the Lonely Mountain)

3)  The Black Riders, 3 Scenarios (takes the players from Bag End to Rivendell)

4)  The Road Darkens, 3 Scenarios (takes the players from Rivendell to the Breaking of the Fellowship on the Anduin)

5)  The Treason of Saruman, 3 Scenarios(takes the players from rescuing the captured Heroes {Merry & Pippin in the books} to the defeat of Saruman at Orthanc)

6)  The Land of Shadow - to be released later this year, 3 Scenarios (will take the players from the banks of the Anduin after the Breaking to the passages of Cirith Ungol at Mordor)

 

Additionally, the following scenarios add to the Saga experience:

 

1) The Old Forest, 1 Scenario, no player cards. Originally released as a special scenario for GenCon 2014, now available as a FFG POD or at most FLGS. The Old Forest can be inserted into the Black Riders scenarios and obviously encompasses the Hobbits' journey through the Old Forest. It follows the first scenario in the Black Riders Saga Box, Shadow of the Past and preceeds the next scenario in that box, A Knife in the Dark.

2)  Fog on the Barrow Downs, 1 Scenario, no player cards. Originally released for a special FFG Fellowship Game Day in the fall of 2014, now available as a FFG POD or at most FLGS. Fog on the Barrow Downs can also be inserted into the Black Riders scenarios right after The Old Forrest. It encompasses the Hobbits' adventures on the Barrow Downs after they depart the Old Forest and preceeds the next scenario in the Black Riders box, A Knife in the Dark.

 

Coming soon:

 

Nightmare versions of The Black Riders. Nightmare scenarios are more difficult versions of the original scenarios and will require the original scenario cards for play.

 

With the precedent set by The Old Forest and Fog on the Barrow Downs scenarios, it is reasonable to assume, but not yet confirmed that FFG will release additional special scenarios for the Lord of the Rings Trilogy Saga Boxes.

As you might be able to tell, based upon my lengthy write-up, I think the Saga boxes are just fantastic and totally worth it if you are enjoying this game. I should caution newer players, however, that the Trilogy Saga scenarios get progressively more and more difficult and would be pretty challenging for players who own a relatively small card pool. If that doesn't worry you, then great! Even if it does worry you get them anyway, they are top-notch!

Help me find a job in Norway (I'm Canadian), and I'll gladly play with you! I had the privilege of visiting your beautiful country on two occasions in 2000-2001, and it's one of my favourite places on Earth. And for what it's worth, I love Vigeland Park! :-)

 

But since this is not likely to happen… enjoy playing the game solo or solo 2-handed! Still a great experience!

Cheers Oslo, Sweden reporting in! Glad you like the game. I play it with my fiancée and childhood friends, but some of us live apart and do not get together for 3- and 4-player games more than once a month or so. Definitely try to get someone else hooked - solo play and multiplayer are totally different experiences, I think. I envy those who live closer to GenCon, but I'll anxiously be waiting for Team Covenant's and The Grey Company's content from it.

TwiceBornh, that's very nice to hear. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] No place like home! 

 

I play Star Wars LCG with my 13 year old son, and my wife is interested in trying Lord of the Rings LCG. And of course, solo play is very much a possibility. But I have yet to find a community here in Norway for it. 

 

The Saga Expansions are going straight on my to-buy list. They sound great. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
