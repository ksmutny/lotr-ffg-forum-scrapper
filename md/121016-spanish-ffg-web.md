Looks decent, but the gray is not my style. Looks too much like a magazine or a news digest or something, but it's better than the previous version.

Is there a connection between FFG and Edge?

Well, aside from being Producer (FFG) and Distribution+Traduction to european languages (Edge) I think that Edge made the web design for FFG web page.
