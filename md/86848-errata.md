Where can I find the Errata's for LOTR LCG cards?  And does anybody even use them much?  

 

Thanks

Of course we use it. You can find it in FAQ doc on rules page or some. The last one is 1.3 i suppose

all the rules supplements are under the LOTR section and then go to "Support."

Yup, 1.4 is the latest version.

It makes a HUGE difference. While they have made some really bad calls now and then ruining some cards, changing some game effects to be much more lenient in general the errata is a big improvement.

 

De finally think you should learn the faq and play to it. Though I choose to ignore some of them.. like that retarded reversal the did on the ruling about surge doom and guarded.
