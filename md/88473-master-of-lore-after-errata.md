The new Master of Lore text after errata:

"Action: Exhaust Master of Lore to name a card type. Lower the cost for you to play the next [Lore] card of that type by 1 until the end of the phase (to a minimum of 1)."

 

Why it still has reference to "a named card type"? Now it works only on one card, the next played...

 

Shouldn't have been something like this?

"Action: Exhaust Master of Lore. Lower the cost for you to play the next [Lore] card by 1 until the end of the phase (to a minimum of 1)."

i suppose its practically the same difference, maybe they figured the more redundant the language the less chance of people not understanding or trying to create loop holes with it

By "...name a card type" I take that to mean that you name either Ally, Attachment or Event. Then the next Lore card of that type that you draw has its cost reduced by 1. Then the "...name a card type" is not redundant at all. Does this explanation make sense?

What's the purpose of naming a card type now? The discount works only for one card anyway, so naming its "type" before playing it is meaningless.

In the original version of "Master of Lore" the naming of the type was there to restrict the discount to some of the Lore cards.

Ridiculous errata. They should have just made him unique instead, so that someone actually uses him.
