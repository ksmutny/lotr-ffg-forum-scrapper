Long night here at work so I figure I'd show off some of my recent LOTR customs. Art is from Google and DeviantArt.

 I love it! Nice work!

what about steed attachments or cards for other Rohirrim we haven't seen yet, like Grimbold and Erkenbrand? Just curious to see if you had any ideas. I like the idea of a 'Helmingas' trait, maybe, with Grimbold providing buffs to those cards.

 Swiftest of Steeds needs the Creature trait. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Or it might make for a nice Mount attachment.

 

I know that'd like some new Rohan cards.

Nice job really like it. And cards is really good balanced not powerful not weak. Very good done.

Really good work !

I was wondering, shouldn't Spirit of Rohan be limited to heroes with the Rohan trait ?

At first I though about making it Unique because so far the all the other resource generators are limited however after giving it a thought "The Spirit of Rohan" is not about a single rider but more of the feeling of riding next to your comrades into the mist of battle.
