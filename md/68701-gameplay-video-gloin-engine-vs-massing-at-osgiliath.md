 Hello forum,

 

time for my 2nd gameplay video. I am showcasing my Gloin Engine deck and in order to not make it too easy, I have chosen Massing at Osgiliath instead of Passage Through Mirkwood from the first video. Hope you enjoy it:

 Thank you for that.  It's a totally different style of play than I use and I always like seeing different viewpoints.

Quite cool video and good playing with very interesting deck. Really enjoy it. See 1 mistake. Last quest phase you didn send scout to quest but after yu ply Grim resolve and refresh everyone you count his will power as well. Anyway is doesn matter on this point but still.

Cool game and cool deck! Really liked.

Thank you Glaurung, I really appreciate your opinion. If there is ever going to be a world tournament, I hope to meet you there ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

About the mistake: You are totally right, I completely forgot to exhaust that Scout (In my mind I wanted to, but my hands didn't follow *g*)

Thx for the video! I never thought about using Faramir twice with :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think you forgot to discard a card for the last dearon's runes (I guess it would have been just one of the sneak attacks)

As a cost efficient variant, you can use him with Ever Vigilant for multiple uses. There is probably no cheaper way to get heaps of willpower.

Yeah, I totally did that.
