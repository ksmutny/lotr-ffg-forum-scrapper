This is a bit surprising and honestly kind of scary for fans of the physical game.

I don't know...

Streamlining the game and implementing a cash shop with currency obtainable ingame or paying for it seems a lot like any other digital card game.

The thing here is that, right now, there are tons of those card games, for pc or portable device. Appealing to more players than, say, the ones that are used to play the tabletop version of LOTR, means that the product is different enough for them and has high quality stakes, because that's what the other digital card games try to achieve.

So, what does this game offer differently? Being coop/solo is a thing, but so are Hearthstone adventures/dungeon runs and Gwent in the near future.

Mechanics-wise we'll need to wait and see, but right now is just another beat the other minions in an exchange of stats. Things like questing or deciding where to travel are condensed and streamlined. Tactical decisions seem less relevant (recalling here how Seastan's Caldara 2.0 works) because, well, its just and exchange of stats (again we'll need to see how it plays).

Quality standards are OK. Background scenarios can be flavourful. Cards are so-so (they seem like in a lot of those card games, round-shaped). What about visual card effects? What about sounds? And voice-over? And music?

Playing in a digital landscape means that you can break the fourth wall, seeing how arrows are shot, or spells are casted, and sound is equally important.

And what about the campaign? Will they tie each quest in a way similar to boons/burdens? With decisions to make, paths to choose and permanent effects to obtain?

Since I'm intrigued and I play other digital card games, I'll test it in Early Access, but right now, for me, it seems another card game, with potential.

I'm glad this was the announcement, because it's a hard pass for me. 

If I want a physical game, I play it. If I want a digital game, I play it. I see no reason to use physical game mechanics in a digital format. Why not do something better adapted to the digital space than a digital card game? Do things digitally you can only do digitally.

I'm super happy about this!  I actually disagree with apparently all of you that it looks bad.  Paying a little for it is standard for card games that go digital (see Star Realms, Smash Up, Terra Mystica, really anything).  Usually they're quite cheap.  I would be less likely to buy it if it were the same exact same game, but it appears they are making a significantly different game which I think is good.  Honestly, I don't really see what everyone's worked up about.  That being said, I understand in advance that very few will agree with this view and that's fine.

I'm with @Willange [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/129561-willange/] I had LotR LCG, but all the upkeep and deck management got to be too much for me, so I sold it. I've been missing the game lately, so I'm actually interested in the digital version of this.

It looks like a completely different game so it's not really a digital version of it.  It might be enjoyable for you none-the-less.

I'm happy for anything Tolkien related that I can actually play.

Although I've bought all the LotR LCG cards, I haven't actually played it in a year or so.  Maybe when my kids get older we can play it together, but right now it's just too hard to break out those cards and re-learn the rules.  I love collecting them, but about 90% of my LotR LCG purchases are still unwrapped, and unplayed.

So, a computer version?  YESSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

 

(...and this means I can stop wasting time day dreaming of how I would implement it myself!)

Yeah, I get that there are changes, but there are also a lot of similarities. You'll still see the same heroes with the same 4 spheres of influence. You'll still gather resources each turn to pay for cards. I imagine it will be as different from the physical version as BattleLore: Command was from BattleLore: Second Edition.

To people saying "this is a completely different game": no. It's not. It has cards with same names, and hopefully similar effects. It has quests with same enemies as can be seen on screenshots. It's not a completely different game. It is a tweaked LotR LCG. Darkest Dungeon quote comes to my mind for some reason: "Nature herself, a victim to the spreading corruption, malformed with misintent".

If we must have a Lord of the Rings 2.0, I'm glad to see in digital format instead of obsoleting my cards.  I'll give it a try when it comes out.

Agreed.

I'm thinking of a game. It's a game where you build your own deck and play solo or co-op in a LOTR universe. You start with 3 heroes, and there's 4 spheres of influence that restrict your deckbuilding. There are enemies, treacheries, allies, attachments, and events. There are quests you play through that have varying stages and objectives.

Anyone to care to take a guess?

 

But yeah, shame on FFG for directing their marking of this tooootallly unrelated game toward people who play the card game. /s

## 18 [BigKahuna on December 10, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3119057)

For me its a hard pass regardless of anything they do with it.  The simple matter is that I have already spent hundreds of dollars on the physical version, I see no reason to pay for it again for the digital one.  If however I didn't own the physical version and was interested in the game, yeah.. I might consider the digital version, but that would most certainly come with the exclusion of buying the physical one.  Its one or the other but not both.

I'm glad to see FFG moving into the digital realm, but they have chosen poorly for their first outing.  I love LoTr the card game, but I already own it so I don't really see any attraction in buying a game I already own, especially one where their are DLC (packs) to buy to expand it.  I think they would have been better off giving digital support to some of their board games, in particular games like Twilight Imperium for example where I would happily buy a digital version of, even at the same price as the physical one since I know I only need to pay for it one time.  Board games are a much better direction than living card games in my humble opinion.

As an owner of the physical version, and having a group of friends with whom I play regularly, this announcment does not interest me at all. Unless it is the testing grounds of a future second edition of the LotR lcg.

I am excited about this. I stopped playing the game because I only played with my brother once or twice every Christmas when we would meet at home. Now we ll be playing it all the time. I just hope it is as challenging and interesting. Also I hope that FFG will not go full greed on this one. The "favor" cards for example are a red flag. I hope they are completlely unecessary. 

On the technical side I hope I see amazing visuals, music (although I am sure I ll be playing Howard Shire as I did with the physical one) and of course voice lines for all the characters. The one silly thing that I dont like is the logo. The original is so amazing? Why change it?

Depends a lot on how different the rules are, and it's hard to tell - but from what I can see/guess, there are no phases, no apparent staging area, no engagement area, a combined attack/defense, no threat on enemies...  It seems like the existence of willpower will likely be a choice between using a character to add quest points and attack with them, without any effective threat.  To the extent there is threat in the game, it seems likely to be a limitation on the cards the AI can play, with higher threat unlocking higher power cards.  Locations sound like they're now the equivalent of quest stages, so basically no locations at all.

I guess it may depend on your definition of "tweaked" - if you think hamburger is just tweaked steak, then yeah, it's a tweaked LOTR LCG.

Look at it another way - if they had announced this as a Star Wars game where the Empire AI played enemies for you to fight while your heroes built up Rebellion points to complete objectives, would you say "Hey, that sounds like LOTR!"?  I have a hard time seeing that.  The similarities would be vague outlines, at best.  You might say "That concept sounds like they brought it over from LOTR", but you certainly wouldn't be saying "They remade LOTR with Star Wars skins!"

Imagine some other studio had just made this exact press release instead of FFG. Would you not cry foul, claiming that they had ripped of LOTR:TCG too closely?  FFG's claim of violated copyright would be the easiest lawsuit ever filed.

I'm just hoping it still incorporates a story well.  Having a well-done voiceover narrating the story would be a rather nice touch.

I know there's not much to go off yet, but the favour cards have me concerned & strike me as pay-to-win.
 
If they're included, then I won't be playing the game.  Paying cash for a one use card is just plain corporate greed.

## 25 [Trialus on December 11, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3119479)

I've generally bounced off of the online card games I've tried (Hearthstone, Elder Scrolls).  Fun, but just not my cup of tea.  However, I think (hope) that this is a good indicator/predictor of the continued health of the LOTR LCG.  I'll definitely give it a try, but do not expect that I'll be super into it.  Hope it has a customer friendly model and does well though!

It'd be nice if it lead to a surge (see what I did there?) of new players of the physical game.

They come across to me more as "pay-for-easy-mode" than "pay-to-win". It's a co-op game after all.

Honestly?  No.  The design elements don't seem at all similar to LOTR to me outside the naming.

I really think you're getting hung up on the IP involved.  If they'd announced this as a Runewars game we might be commenting on some of the similar mechanics and ideas, but nobody would be calling it the same game.  Honestly, by your standard Arkham is the same game as LOTR - I think they have more in common than the new digital version does.

Well, this is the same game with the same name, same components, same environment, same but watered down rules. Yep, it's tweaked LotR LCG.

Pay to win is general term for selling power within the game, and selling power is rarely healthy. Let me put it that way, in the best-case scenario selling power is ineffective, in any other it is damaging.

 

Anyway, I will be buying the game as soon as it hits the Steam and digging deep into it. Cept for the case when they put an unreasonable price tag on it, which is not uncommon given the place I live. We tend to get a lot of euro prices here with the neglect to our paying ability.

I'm burnt-out on the micro-transaction / cash-shop model after playing Elder Scrolls Online since beta.  So the favour cards put me on the defensive.

I have no problems with paying for set expansions (same as the current LCG format), but I won't be paying for single-use cards or gamble crates etc.

Let's hope FFG pleasantly surprises me.

i don't know about the rest of you, but when i heard about the digital edition i thought great but then when i saw it was based like hearthstone i was under whelmed i was thinks of something a little more interesting and deserving of the LCG, i was hoping of something along the lines of an interactive game map where you select you quest and join others on an online-multi-player or local area network to beat the quest, similar to what octgn does with there table top only with more automation to make it easier for new players, for example when sending characters to the quest it does all the maths for you but it gives you a cut scene or something for your characters going to the quest either traveling through the location or battling enemies along the way that would be great. i did not really like hearthstone it seemed to little bang for the buck i played it cant say i enjoyed it that much but there is so much more they could have done with it, i love the LOTR LCG and will continue to buy and play it but i don't think i will look at this version of it, it doesn't seem to do the LOTR LCG justice.

See, I really don't know where people are getting this.

Name?  OK, sure, but irrelevant.

Components?  The cards are notably different, not even having the same stats (no defense, HP values so different they really aren't the same).  Sphere means something completely different.  We haven't seen game text yet, but I could name a dozen off the top of my head that can't be the same just with what we know of the new rules.

Same environment?  How?  Sure, there's a place where enemy cards goes, but that doesn't make it a staging area.  There are no engagement areas.  There are no locations.

Watered down rules?  Generally agree here, but there's a point where the rules stop being watered down and are just different.

The only way anything between these two games are the "same" is if you make the definitions so broad as to be meaningless.  "Components"?  OK, so you have cards with an attack value and a questing value, and hit points.  You have some form of progress token, and you have some form of damage token.  I'm describing a game here, can you tell which one?

Again - if they'd skinned this on Star Wars and called it a revival of the first-gen SWLCG, you'd never connect it to LOTR.

Why not?  Arkham was obviously built on and evolved from LOTR.  You can very clearly see the elements that Matt introduced to LOTR before moving to Arkham.  The broad outlines are the same.  That doesn't make them the same game.  What matters is the mechanics.  Again, I've asked repeatedly - looking at what we know of the games, if you were handed this to playtest - no art, no names, just "Character A", "Enemy B", "Objective Z", would you recognize it as LOTR?

AT BEST it's a completely new version of the game.  Which still makes it a different game.

Let's try the flip side - I've pointed out any number of things that make it different.  What makes it the same?  I don't mean silly broad stuff like "It has resources!" or "It still has spheres!", because FFG has factions in all their card games, whatever they happen to be called.  Looking at what we know, can you list a few rules that transfer identically?

I don't need to, because argument is about it being a completely different game, and to be completely different game it needs to absolutely deviate from the concept of the LotR of the Rings (I did that on purpose), which it doesn't.

You do realize that it's utterly impossible for any two games to be completely different by this definition, right?

Sorry, edited to be slightly more productive.

But it's a ludicrous standard that hides behind pedantic absolutism.

I guess we could call it "A game that's so different you'd never ever think it was the same game unless marketing helpfully pointed it out for you", but that's a bit more painful to type.

It's kinda lonely and I'm excited for this game! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I think an official discord server would help a lot, as well, to get this first Fantasy Flight digital game off the ground. See what I did there? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Luke (FFI CM) wondered if enough of the community would be interested in a server during the latest twitch stream. Speaking for myself, I say, "Do Hobbits like their ale?". What say ye folks?

Here's my post from reddit.

Yeah I saw all of it. There were around 100 viewers which is a bit disappointing considering the existing community. But then again many could be at work depending their timezone. 

The game looks ok at the moment. The UI and the card designs are far from finished. The community manager mentioned that this is a pre-alpha phase of the game and that things should look better upon release. FFG is known for its excellent production value in its boardgames. I hope FFI follows. Because at the moment the card desings are so ugly. The Hearthstone format, although it works, is kinda off with the LOTR LCG mechanics. The fonts on the cards (explaining the rules are also ugly). But again, he said that these things are subject to change. The mouse-pointer while he played was standard windows arrow head, which stood out to me. Other games I played like Gwent and Hearthstone usually change it to something that fits the lore. 

Anyway, he played a bit (for about 15 mins). The visuals again are meh. The good thing is that every character has voice lines. Not all the phases were there but the game felt very similar to the cardboard version. 

He showed the main menu but he didn't click anything other than play. The menu and its UI is also very raw and unappealing to the eye at the moment. He said that he didn't want to go to the deckbuilder because there are cards that they don't want to reveal yet. He also talked about the favor cards. These cards will be something like "draw two cards for 0 resources" for example. 

He said that he will stream every Tuesday and Thursday at 1pm CST revealing more features. And apparently the game goes to Early Access on Steam (only single player for the moment) at 2018 Q1. 

EDIT: I should add that this stream was not recorded on twitch but they twitted that the following ones will be.

Steam is free but he is only a plateform to access to games. Most games on steam are not free, but this one seem to be free. But you probably have to buy cards either with in-game money (earning doing what the game ask you to do) or with real money. This is an economic model named free to play (free but you may pay to avoid to spend times at doing things or to have bonus).

I'm probably not the right person to ask for impressions of the stream, as I was too busy frantically trying to type out a play-by-play for Discord. But in this short interregnum before the next stream, since people seem to be hungry for more info and the vid is apparently lost to the ether, here is what I said on Discord. While I was doing my best, the following should not be considered cold, hard fact as to what happened; indeed, I wonder whether it is even prudent for me to post this, but here it is regardless.

(Lightly edited for spelling and a couple of factual mistakes.)

sappidus: Sneak Attack time…
sappidus: didn't catch what exactly happened, lol

sappidus: There's a start of round card draw.
sappidus: Ithilien Lookout exhausts an enemy on arriving.
sappidus: Ending the quest now.

sappidus: PC/Mac are the only announced platforms, but definitely looking around.
sappidus: 'making things more digestible but still really challenging'

sappidus: Favor cards: 'to make sure the difficulty of the game stayed intact while still making the game accessible for new players'
sappidus: Most of the time you'll be earning them (as opposed to buying them, unless you want to.)
sappidus: Most of the time, you should be able finish a quest without using any favor cards.
sappidus: (subject to feedback during development)

sappidus: 'We're hearing the request for 3/4 player'

sappidus: 'I can't discuss pricing. We're still deciding on basic amounts.'
sappidus: Founders' Packs will be at 3 tiers of pricing, though.

sappidus: (referring to the LCG)

sappidus: 'We're definitely looking at other FFG games to see how campaign structures can be successful.'

sappidus: begging for early-access to get more feedback, ha
sappidus: sounds like they're serious about engaging the community
sappidus: in a more official capacity than FFG historically has been

sappidus: might do alt-arts at some points, but never mechanically specific cards earnable through $ only

sappidus: still haven't decided how Valor cards will actually, well, work

sappidus: New packs will be released on a 'seasonal schedule'. (not like 4 seasons/yr, though)
sappidus: 'Pretty big card pool available at launch.'

sappidus: They've talked about Sauron mode! But can't really comment.
sappidus: Easy/med/hard differences are mostly in what Sauron can play against you.
sappidus: Not quite like Nightmare (with its new cards).

sappidus: The AI is 'interesting and unique, and something we're really proud of'.
sappidus: Not just a copy of a human player. Will go into detail in a future blog post.

sappidus: Another stream on Thu 1pm. Expect biweekly streams.
sappidus: Other guests. You'll be excited, especially fans of the tabletop game.

sappidus: Seastan was name-checked during a question, heh.

sappidus: more verbiage about open communication

sappidus: And we're out.

Two things: 1) Will this have the same style of card acquisition as the physical LCGs (Core Set, Deluxe Expansions, and Fixed-content Boosters)? 2) Am I mad or does FFI's logo look like it should be attached to a Final Fantasy game?

No ansver to that yet... 

but if I have to ques, I would think that scenarios Are smaller versions of scenario packs. New scenario and some player cards, or only player cards... (see the next)

Not sure how new big adventures Are included... big expensive dls that give you core cards and some/all dls and some  smal expansions that give player cards (aka adventure packs to sink player money in) or core the adventure and player cards and the scenario packs like in real Lcg to give next scenario and some cards.

but not much is said about how cards Are distributed.

Besides being solo/co-op, one of the big selling points is that, yes, it will keep the same or similar model as the LCG - fixed packs.

The Core Set you receive for free after completing the tutorial, then there will be "hero packs" which contain a hero and then some cards that are built around that hero. You know what's in them, just like an AP. There will be other card packs as well.

As far as adventures, though, that's not been made clear.

Luke clarified this on yesterday's stream. There is no beta, there's just early access. To be a part of this we'll buy one of three Founder's Packs ($10/$20/$40*). This will include some exclusive goodies and valor points. He said they wanted there to be some buy-in so the players have skin in the game (paraphrasing); seems like a smart idea to keep out the riff raff when feedback is expected.

We expect early access to probably start in March.

No demo at PAX.

And what video? The've been showing several things: deck builder, 4 of the 5 adventures from the starter scenario (the last only half of it), they've shown favor cards, anatomy on cards (rarity, level and all the core cards, maybe subject to change), the 4 core heroes...

A bunch of things! Stil didnt show anything about shop, palantír feature and the "coming soon" feature.

More rarity = more expensive to  buy with valor (the currency used to buy cards) .

It also means that the card will be more powerful.

I thot they were all within the packs? Does this means you only buy packs with real money, and when you wanna buy stuff with valor - you buy individual cards?

Oh no, all player cards (being normal or favor) will be obtainable via valor. That includes hero packs and cards that can be bought separate. 

When they decide to show the shop we'll have a better understanding about "pack format". Right now we know that it'll be hero packs (one hero and a few player cards thematically linked to that hero/trait) and separate cards.

## 76 [John Constantine on January 13, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265046-digital-card-game-announced/?do=findComment&comment=3168002)

I did not meant that some player cards were exclusive via money, I mean this:

Rarity is irrelevant when you buy stuff via real money, you buy whole packs of cards.

But, if you want to buy cards with valor, you buy not packs, but individual cards separately, and that's when "rarity" comes in, making different cards cost different valor.

Nope. You buy hero packs with their sets of cards either way.  But there are some cards that are not available in packs, and must be purchased separately (with either valour or real currency).

The rarity thing is very confusing. Almost everyone gets the wrong idea when they see it. 

I think it just signifies different layers of cost, with "rarer" cards costing more Valour.

I kinda hope that they change the terms before launch.

Well, yes, rarity is kinda wrong term to use when the system you get it with is not random.

Agreed, I prefer no rarity layering and just adequate pricing (even if that means different values of valor depending on the card power).

In one of the streams, they said that the rarity was just an internal classification that had no bearing on gameplay or deck building

I don't quite understand what this early access means. I thought that i could be able to play it but couldn't find any download button or link. Am i missing something?

The Early Access version is still "Coming Soon", so not yet available. I assume that, likely over the next few days, the game's store page will change and you will see options to sign up for early access.

Steam today made it sound like March for early access.

1st quarter... March is the last month of 1st quarter, so a good ques :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

And projects like this are more likely be late, than early, because some nasty bugs are found all night long!
