Personally I'd like a revision of Lindir.  I know that he enables the Noldor mechanic and there's a place for him in that build.  But I'd have really liked to see him be a minstrel and have something to do with songs.  His name means "chant" or "sing" in sindarin, so it seems as though he should have done something with songs.  I think a lore version who was basically Damrod for songs would be fitting.  It'd really help out the whole song framework in the game.  Bringing love of tales and certain songs into greater viability.  

 

As has been noted, Radagast is about over due for a rehaul.  Changer of shapes and hues is a broad description of him, and in this game theres a lot of potential for that.  As Yavannnas Istari tied to both plants and animals I don't think it would be contrary to his character to have some sort of interaction with Ents.   After all, how can a disciple of Yavanna who existed since the beginning of time not know about the guardians of the trees?  Change of color and of hues could have implications for sphere changes... as Istari are non-sphere entities in the game I'm not sure how that could be  simulated but I don't believe it would be too much of a stretch.  Maybe more of an emphasis on his spell-work may be in order.  An asfaloth-esque benefit for Radagast but still viable with other Istari?

While, I agree that it would be cool to see a Lindir that works with songs, I'm not sure that the Song archetype needs any help. If anything, Love of Tales probably needs errata at this point.

 





 

As for Radagast, I wholeheartedly agree that it is time that he sees an update. Synergy with creatures, ents (perhaps) and some interaction with Spell events would all be nice to see.

I'd like to see some more allies with the Creature trait, taking us beyond eagles (as much as I love eagles). There are bears (to go with the Beornings), hounds, birds (like Roac the Raven), Gandalf's moth even... It could also be interesting, for example, to have allies that can transition to Mount attachments like Huan [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Huan-FA] from the First Age. On the whole, a creature-based synergy could go very well with the release of a Radagast hero!

Narya (though we can be pretty confident that's coming in The Grey Havens). A new Radagast would be good, yeah, and more creatures. A hero or ally of Gilraen would be cool (I was hoping she'd be the Dunedain hero in Battle of Carn Dum, but no such luck, though Amarthiul's neat too).

Bill the Pony hero!

I'd like if the designers really explored the artifact trait, with cool new artifacts and artifact related cards. I've said it a ton of times, I know, but it's still my top 1 thing I wanna see. Also, more support for the Gondor and Dunedai traits. I'd like to see an 8 or 9 threat Leadership hero with 2 or 3 willpower and a cool ability, and another way to draw cards in Leadership.

I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but I'd actually quite like to see a new Glorfindel hero. His Lore incarnation just doesn't seem to have a terribly worthwhile ability in the current meta, while his Spirit incarnation isn't much fun for me to play. Spirit Glorfindel doesn't even have an ability; given that Light of Valinor is essentially an auto-include for him, he might as well have a blank text box. A Tactics Glorfindel (Swordfindel?) would be great, I think, and might help to usher the Spirit version out of a few decks.

I too wanted Tactics Glorfindel, preferably in the Grey Havens, but it just doesn't seem to be the way with Glorfindel ally on the near horizon. And that is cool, too.

 

Well, I would like to see Thranduil and Elves of Mirkwood. A little problem there, with the allies, is that they will be Silvan, and thus work great with Celeborn.

 

I second Radagast, though I finally play the old version.

 

Above all, I would like to see player cards for Tom Bombadil and Goldberry. I have high hopes for the next cycle.

I would like to get Narya, which I believe will happen in the Grey Havens.

 

Radagast hero I would like too and offcourse Thranduil. Also a tactic version of Imrahil

Not necessarily looking for named cards, but a few mechanics I'd like to see:

 

A one cost Event that can cancel the Surge keyword on a card revealed from the encounter deck.

 

More cards like Renewed Friendship that give you bonuses for helping another player.

 

More cards that give love to Sentinel characters, like Ranged characters have.

 

A Noldor attachment that let's you discard the top card of your deck. If it's an ally you can add their will to the hero for the round (or it could be attack or defense).

 

More trait specific card support like what Ranger has (Healer, Warrior, Noble, etc..)

Actually on your first suggestion I'd go slightly further and say I wish Song of Staying [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Song-of-Staying-FA] could be an FFG card as well as a First Age one.

 

And yeah, more stuff for the 'job' traits like Warrior and Noble would be nice (mostly those two, Healer is still incredibly rare. Scout less so, though it's primarily allies of course).

I want a Spirit Faramir.  In fact, I was shocked to find that we weren't getting a Spirit Faramir hero in Land of Shadow.  Faramir is one of the few people who have successfully resisted the lure of the ring and has many characteristics that define the spirit sphere.

I second Thranduil. One of the biggest named characters that we don't have yet.

I'd like a deluxe box + cycle set in Dale. I wouldn't mind seeing one that focuses on Silvan as well, preferably with Thranduil as one of the heroes.

Oh, and the traits. I would like to see more traits given love, not just for heroes as they did with the title attachments but for characters, giving bonuses if warriors stick together, for instance. And other traits, even of attachments, like "titles" themselves. So many possibilities.

Beorning, Woodmen, Creatures!

Dunland allies!

I think Wose allies are not that far of a reach, unique ally Ghan-buri-Ghan.

Saruman hero. He is one of the biggest named characters who deserves a hero version.

New Frodo version seems in order.

I would like anot her secrecy hero in leadership, another version of Frodo fits nicely. I join the chorus of people who want tactics Eowyn. I want every hero to have a unique ally version. I go against the crowd in that I love attachments or other cards that are hero specific, so I can't wait to see the ring of power for Gandalf or Cirdan (same ring). I would love it if they made an Aragorn hero or ally that rewarded you for playing with the three hunters (Legolas, Gimli, and Ragorn) to make thematic fellowship decks stronger. I would love a new Bilbo hero. I think tactics needs a hero that truly access at questing but not because of high wp. I think a Gollum hero that reduces the threat of enemies and/or locations could do that.

I would also love to see more cards that interacted with playing together,eg giving someone a resource, letting someone draw, give someone an attachment. Renewed Friendship are not worth including, that room is better spend at other cards. Some ally, like a Hobbit or some other cool character that provides something like "Response: After you provide another player with a resource, exhaust Hothar to add one resource to a hero you control."

Things like that

You're in for a big treat with this new cycle coming out which utilizes on cross-sphere (and cross-player) resource spending.

A card, I'm sure we'd all want to see, would be a boss enemy card with high stats (50/8/8/12/42) and this text:
Cannot have attachments. Immune to player card effects. Indestructible. Cannot have more than 2 damages per round. Cannot be defended or attacked by allies.
Cannot leave the staging area and is engaged with each players. Makes an immediate attack when any player draws any number of cards, cancels a When revealed effect, plays an event, spends resources, exhausts, readies a character or triggers a character's ability.
At the end of the round, each player raises is threat by 3.

No, not that.  I mean, Unexpected Courage certainly makes Dori better, but he makes practically every other Hero better as well, and most other heroes have something better to exploit than 1/2/2 and an exhausting effect that only is useful in *very* rare circumstances.  I'm looking for something that would make *Dori* useful relative to other heroes, and an out-of-sphere two-cost attachment you'd play on one of your other heroes instead isn't it.

 

Complicating matters is that if it were *specifically* a Dori toy, it would've need to have been in Dori's pack.  So while this would make Dori more useful:

 

Tactics attachment cost 0 -- Dori's Courage.  Attach to Dori.  When Dori exhausts for a reason other than to quest, attack, or defend, ready him.

 

It's not an option.  That would finally make his lame ability useful, though, and help him in some other situations as well.  It'd even enhance his ally version who actually is already useful.  But too late for that.

 

Further, cards that are tied to one specific hero aren't terribly interesting, even though they're always useful for that specific hero.  What I want is something that helps out Dori a lot, but doesn't have to be used with Dori.  And that means synergy with his rarely-useful ability.

 

So his ability

1) Exhausts after defender is declared

2) Adds his defense to another hero's defense for one attack.

 

The edge case where this ability is useful is where you don't need Dori's attack or defense for anything, but you need to buff a hero defender to take some massive attack (or another player's hero when Dori's player has no enemies).  I see two angles:

 

1) Get rid of the exhaust cost somehow.  Without the exhaust, Dori can buff a defending hero and still attack (making him solo-friendly), or potential buff multiple hero defenders in a multiplayer context.

2) Give some extra benefit for adding defense.

 

For #1, something like this would really help Dori

Tactics 1 attachment -- Unexpected Valor.  When a Hero exhausts not to quest, defend, or attack, exhaust unexpected valor to ready him.

 

This makes Dori useful even in solo, and the attachment is in-sphere.  It's also extremely useful for other heroes with an exhaust ability (Beravor, Denethor, Elanor, Haldir, Galadriel, Merry), but most of the other heroes have once per round limitations and only Dori has the attachment in-sphere.  The attachment would also be handy for attachments that exhaust themselves and the hero, but again that's not repeatable and only in-sphere for Great Yew Bow.

 

For #2, something like this would be useful

Tactics event (cost 1?) -- Counter-stroke.  After a hero defends without taking damage, do damage to enemy equal to the hero's attack.

 

With that, Dori's loss of action advantage can be worth it, because by buffing the defense of a good *attacking* hero he can potentially enable substantial direct damage.  Suddenly Dori becomes useful in a Gimli deck, serving as a defender most of the time but enabling the occasional massive counter stroke.  But it's also a card that doesn't require Dori to be in play to be handy in a deck.  (Maybe it should be "after a character defends", though?)

 

The cards I like to see the most are the ones that are useful on their own, but also makes other cards not currently useful to be more generally useful.  And I see a binder hero as more tragic than a binder ally, event, or attachment.  Cards that synergize with binder cards expand the effective card pool by more than one card, and how cool is that?

I like this, but in the second case, wouldn't it be the hero he's adding defense to that gets the attack? I don't see how this is better than just sticking a Gondorian shield on Beregond. I do love the idea of a finding a way to make him more useful. The first one could also be used situationally, for things like Hide tests or other quest/travel effects that cause you to exhaust, and neuters some shadow cards.

The idea of a readying effect that works specifically when the character exhausts for a purpose other than quest/attack/defend is pretty cool and would have a decent range of applications.

For Dori though, I'd rather his ability just get errata'd to be more useful. Let it trigger after the shadow is revealed and/or let it work on allies as well as heroes. Either of those could make him way more usable.

Yes, in the second case, it would be based on the hero he's adding defense to get the attack.  The point would be to wall-up an attacking Hero with Dori so you could do a devastating counter stroke.

 

So if you plopped a Gondorian shield on Beregond, he defends for 6 without Dori's intervention and can easily fulfill the "without taking damage" part, but his counterstroke is only 1 damage.  Not much point.

 

Now suppose you have Dori & a damaged (4 damage) Gimli together.  Without enhancements, Dori can buff Gimli's defense to four, and then Gimli could do six *direct damage* with the event if nothing gets through.  If you buff Dori's defense with things like Ring Mail or Gondorian Shield, you can make this go more often, if you enhance Gimli's attack with one of the many other cards you can get some massive direct damage.  Could be a devastating combo for non-immune enemies.

I don't believe it does.  If someone wants to build a a two-handed Rube-Goldberg machine which  requires buying multiples of the same AP so they can draw tons of cards without playing any allies to beat journey to Rhosgobel then that's great. 

 

I think a good analogy would be a video game where some dude found a corner in a far off area of the map where if you crouch jump spin around and fire your PP7 for 45 minutes while exploiting another cheat for perpetual ammo but neccessitating that you have a second person on split screen to stand on top of... then you can go outside the board and shoot people. 

 

I think if people want to pursue that sort of experience they should.  As for myself, I like shooting and running from zombies.  I don't think the PP7 should be nerfed because someone likes to do those sorts of things in a corner for 45 minutes with their imaginary friend. 

 

But that's just my two cents.

The video is just an example. In a solo setting or in a multiplayer setting with "real" people you can still make a Love of Tales deck that trivializes most quests.

I'd like to see more options to play a 'rush' deck. One that has a very strong opening but runs out of air in the long run. Hero Beorn is one of those 'rush' type cards, but Escort from Edoras and Children of the Sea don't have enough support imo.

 

I think currently the strategy of most decks is to stabilize in the early game, then smash the encounter deck with your new advantage. It would be fun to see more exploration of different tempo decks.

I'd like to have a powerful Halbarad ally, as I've strived to no avail to make a solo deck that uses his hero version to beat Carn Dum and the Land of Shadow quests.

Cards that make a Dunedain deck (so without too much traps and Gondor Rangers) viable.

Good new Dwarf hero. Saruman hero. Grima ally. Creature allies.

Creature enemies. More cards that feature big risk/big reward, on locations that is. Making the travel phase more of a thing!

For me it's Thranduil without a doubt. Are there any characters as "big" as him that haven't been made yet? Have the designers given a reason why we haven't seen him, or he just hasn't fit into any of their plans thus far?

One more thing I thought about: Gimli.

 

That is to say, a version of him that does his book-version justice by being about his openness and interest in other cultures, friendship with Legolas/Galadriel, synergy with Elf-friend etc. To me that's what Gimli's character is all about, and the versions we have of him in the game now are pretty genereric dwarf-berseker.

I cannot agree more. While Gimli is certainly a fighter, he is also thoughtful and sensitive. He has some of my favorite lines in the books. I love that Aragorn chooses Gimli as the one to accompany himself, Frodo, and Sam to Mt. Doom. Oh what could have been... 

 

I actually happen to like tactics Gimli, but he just doesn't feel right to me, especially since he doesn't really work well with Legolas. Aragorn has 3 spheres covered, but a 3 hunters team will be T,T,X by necessity. A lore version of Gimli would be a wonderful addition to the game, mechanically and thematically. I'd also appreciate a Spirit version of Legolas, but that seems less important since his current iteration is still so great.

This.

 

We need a Gimli either Lore or Spirit, which would probably be more in-character than what we had so far, IMO. And of course Thranduil is way overdue, I think he may be the last main character that lacks it. Maybe also Saruman, would be great, in his hero form.

I hope the next cycle (after the upcoming Numenor cycle) is set around Mirkwood and the Lonely Mountain, and Rhovanion. It would be an excellent opportunity to introduce Thranduil and build up the Dale trait.

 

We know huge battles take place in that area during the time-frame of Return of the King - even resulting in the death of both Dain and Brand (or his son? Don't remember). There must be a good deal of interest that could be explored in that area.

Having been playing around with Zigil Miner, Ered-Nimrais Prospector, and Longbeard Sentry, I'd really like it if there was another card like Hidden Cache which granted a benefit when it was discarded from your deck. Or a card which granted benefits when cards were discarded from your deck (something like a dwarven mining equivalent of Galdor), or maybe another way of returning cards you discard like that (I guess maybe like a dwarven mining equivalent of Silver Harp, after a card is discarded from your deck, exhaust [Card] to shuffle it back into your deck).

I really like the Dwarven mining mechanic and definitely wish we had more cards to synergize with it. It can lead to larger deck sizes, too, if we routinely discard 15, 20 cards per game without a recycle mechanic.

I've actually been running a tactics/spirit dwarven miner deck using Longbeard Sentry and Zigil Miner to do most of the digging.  King Under the Mountain is good for that too (played on this deck by a second leadership/lore standard dwarven deck), and for actually getting cards into your hand.

 

Of course, at this time the only thing to hope for when discarding is Hidden Cache, but I feel sure we'll see more of this.  I put Stand and Fight in there to give the discard pile more meaning, and of course Ziggy gets resources by mining.  It's fun but very incomplete as a deck type, the act of discarding itself needs to be more dramatic.  Gems! We need gems!

Do you have Galadhrim Weavers to get the Hidden Caches back in your deck?

That would be smart, but it's also a thematic deck and limits itself to dwarf cards.  It does use Will of the West since the deck can exhaust itself quickly if you get the discard thing going early, and I've hit HIdden Cache 3-4 times in a single game before.

Timing it so the Hidden Cache is the top card of the discard pile can be problematic as well. Ered-Nimrais Prospector is better because it can target any card in your discard, but obviously it's the wrong sphere for Grandspleen's deck.

You can include Protector of Lorien, etc in order to get Caches from your hand to your discard pile for free, and then playing the Weaver.

I'd like to see some development of the Craftsman, Healer, Noble and Warrior traits.

Play only if all your heroes are x.

+x to all x heroes.

-1 cost if all heroes are x

Etc

Would be a whole new deck building dimension in the game which there is little reason to explore at the moment.

Hope not!

 

I would love to see an Eagle hero but if they're going to do it then it would have to be Meneldor. Yeah, it doesn't make sense thematically but mechanically losing ally Gwaihir would hit current Eagle decks pretty hard. He is a key way that deck has stayed as viable as it has since he can be used to very quickly pump Eagles of the Misty Mountain. 

 

If you're going to have a Hero Gwaihir you would need to built quite a bit more to the trait before making people cut clutch cards. Of the Eagles, the most replaceable is probably Landroval. 

 

If we do see a reemergence of Eagles, I am hoping for a Radagast Hero.

Non-campaign player cards with the the Setup keyword would be amazing. They could open up deck-building space for as-yet mostly unviable strategies like single hero decks (thinking of something like Solitary Outlaw from First Age). Another example might be a card that lowers your starting threat if all of your heroes are hobbits, or a card that boosts your hero's willpower by 1 but limits your hand size to 4, a card that generates additional resources if all your heroes are noble, etc. In a way, the ships in the new cycle will fulfill a similar role, but can only be used with a particular set of quests.
