I am having some trouble with the mechanics of Journey to Rhosgobel -- specifically, I realize that Wilyador starts the game in the staging area, but when does he leave the staging area and join you as an ally?  Grimbeorn's card, in Conflict at the Carrock, is very clear in stating that you must pay resources, but I am not sure how to get Wilydor out of the staging area and thus joining my allies.  I searched the forums for an answer but any help I can get on this topic is greatly appreciated...

"The first player gains control of Wilyador."

 

Whoever is first player automatically gains control of him. When the first player token is passed, so is control of Wilyador.

And since it's a passive effect, i.e. an always-on condition, it also applies at the beginning of the game. So Wilyador will come out of the staging area, and the first player will gain control of him, during Setup.
