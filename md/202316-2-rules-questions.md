Please, help remind me. The first question is about multiple defenders, it is so long since I had used them but I was thinking about the new Anchor Watch card. When you have multiple defenders of an attack, thanks to Stand Together, Dori or the above, and the attack strength is higher than the defense, how do you deal damage? Do you have to apply it all to one character? And can you overkill it?

 

The second is with Hands Upon the Bow and Quick Strike against immune to player cards enemies. If I remember correctly, the former is not allowed whilst the latter is, but I am not sure, and am not sure if I see why, the wording seems almost the exact same.

 

Thanks!

Damage is applied to a single character when using multiple defenders, you can't spread it around.

Ok, thanks, I thought so. And if there is more damage than remaining hit points, you still do not damage another character?

Hands upon the bow targets an enemy in the staging area, thus if it is immune to player cards you can't target that enemy.

 

Quick strike allows a character to make a normal attack against an enemy. Quick strike only ever targets one of your characters so in effect you aren't actually targeting the enemy, your character's attack is.

 

Hope that helps.

Ok, that was the thing, I remembered right. And thanks for the explanation, though Quick Strike also mentions an enemy, the wording is really, very very close, but I now see the nuance.

The key thing to remember about Immune to Player Card Effects is that it never makes any sense.

1. Yes, if youhave multiple defenders only one will take the damage even if it's Overkill 

 

2. I fear Davachido is wrong, both, "Hands upon the bow" and "Quick Strike" target your own character and allow them to make an attack against an enemie (and immune to Player Card effects doesn't prevent getting attacked):

This would also fit with the Report in the cardgamedb rules clarification threat (page 4, right at the top):

Caleb says, that you can attack Bolg, who is immune to Player Card effects, with "Hands upon the bow"

 

Edit: My 2nd point is wrong, the ruling I refer to is outdated (see next post by GrandSpleen)

That ruling about Bolg and Hands Upon the Bow was reversed soon after it was given, around the time when the FAQ was updated to include extra information about "immune" enemies.  

 

From that FAQ:

"For example: Hands Upon the Bow (D 131) cannot be used to attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects, because it clearly indicates that the player must pick an enemy in the staging area to attack. This is different from Quick Strike (Core 35), which targets a character and allows them to perform a normal attack, which is a framework effect."

 

You're right in that the wording for Hands Upon the Bow and Quick Strike is virtually identical.  The official ruling is that QS doesn't target an enemy while HUtB does.  I haven't ever seen that justified with respect to the card text, was which maddening to me at the time that the ruling was made.  Anyway, that is the official line.

Thanks a lot for the clarification.

Thanks Grand, that's the ruling I remembered, wasn't sure where I saw it but good that it's in the FAQ now.

 

I think there's an old thread on BGG where someone got a reply from Caleb about it. Basically something about QS makes an attack target an eligible enemy which means that the card is only targeting a character to allow them to attack out of the attack phase.

 

Whereas hand upon the bow allows you to circumvent normal attack rules for targeting, similar to Dunhere, by targeting that enemy with the ability on the card. At least that's what the officially ruling goes anyway.

So my Information was outdated, I'm sorry for any confusion i might have caused.
