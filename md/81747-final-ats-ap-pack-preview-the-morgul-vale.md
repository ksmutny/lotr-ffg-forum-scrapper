# [Final AtS AP pack Preview: The Morgul Vale!!!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/)

Finally some awesome news!

Looks like an epic scenario especially considering the Nazgul "boss" whom looks like he is pretty hard to kill

I'm also really excited at the reveal of one of my favorite characters, Theodan!!!

His stats and ability are just fantastic too, granted starting 12 threat is whatever but giving that universal boost to all tactics characters is clutch.  Especially with that "steed of the mark" card.  I already have visions of Theodan and Tactics Boromir just ripping through encounter decks with it…although one would have to include spirit which would actually work well to help lower the treat from boromir and their combined starting threat.

What other good combo's do you guys envision for him?

He looks great. Bear in mind he only boosts heroes though. Well suited to a mono sphere deck I think, which would work well in multiplayer with a spirit deck

First off, I am almost as excited about the Steed as I am about Théoden. Just the other day I remembered when Asfaloth came out, they mentioned he is the first mount, and then… there was a long break. Now I am thinking if there shall be a card that searches for Mounts?

I too first thought of Boromir when seeing Théoden, the two "tragic" heroes can really be powerful I feel. It also makes sense we are probably not going to see an overall Rohan boost (like Dain's) since there is Mutual Accord which makes Gondor Rohan (and vice versa). On the other hand, there is an overall Gondor boost already, though much less global and/or potent than for the Dwarves. I see this paragraph is not much good but I am excited about Rohan and Gondor synergies. Gondor seems to be the trait that binds things together quite a bit, Gondor and Outlands (given - Hunter of Lamedon, for now), Gondor and Dúnedain (Blood of Gondor, for now), Gondor and Rohan (Mutual Accord or the previewed Steed).

What I think shall be toughest in making a mono-sphere Tactics deck (for solo) is threat reduction now. With Théoden, Willpower can be managed but since there are now low-threat Tactics heroes, this may be an issue…

Theoden looks awesome. I've been waiting for a Theoden card. I'm a little bummed that he doesn't seem to synergize with other Rohan cards as well as I'd like, but with some tweaking, I'm sure it could work. You could have Theodred, Dunhere, and Eowyn in one deck and Theoden, Hama, and some other guy in the second deck. I'm liking the idea of Thalin for the third Tactics member. It could be pretty cool.

Yes, he affects himself. In the article it says he quests for three because of his ability. =D

Good hero. Sounds much more balanced now. He give a good boost but only to heroes not to every one……. And threat cost 12 for cool hero is ok.

Looks like they start to do more careful job. Hope we will not see some game braker like Dian anymore.

P.S. Nazgul is cool!!!!

Yeah, the Nazgul looks nasty.  Tough stats, takes at least 5 turns to kill,  and engagement threshold is only at 1.  Obviously, there will be something in the deck itself (on the quest or location cards) that will help deal with him, or he is simply too nasty.  And destroys what little attempt at Secrecy you could hope for.  But I like that they are making him super-hard to deal with.  Just waiting to see what twists the deck will throw at us for handling him!

 

I was underwhelmed at Theoden at first.  He just feels pretty limited.  With those stats, that seems odd to say, I know.  I don't mind the 12 threat to start with, and his great stats reflect the steep cost… no complaints there.  I would just rather have a hero I can be more versatile with… he is pretty much guaranteed to be assigned to an all-Tactics hero lineup.  But it's really a small complaint… not every hero can fit every deck.

A couple ideas of heroes to pair with him… (don't have access to my cards right now, so just pulling some out of my head):

Theoden - Gimli - Brand (33 threat):  For sheer bang for your buck in terms of Theoden's boost ability.  3 Tactics heroes that could quest for 3 willpower a piece… dang.  Not much synergy between them beyond that, although would be a decent multiplayer lineup (epecially if you could get sentinel on Gimli), particularly if you could get another player to do some serious threat reduction for you (that is going to be a theme for any deck with Theoden, I imagine).

Theoden - Boromir - Glorfindel (spirit) (28 threat) - Now THIS lineup I would be interested in trying myself!  The obvious detraction is that in adding a non-tactic hero, you lessen Theoden's effect.  But a constant boost to himself and Bormir is still pretty **** good, and Glorfindel adds in that synergy piece of bringing in the threat-reduction blue cards, as well as the readying cards (UC, new mount… not that impressed with mount) that will free Boromir and Theoden to just be three-hormed beasts- quest, defend, or attack!  Oh, and Glorfindel is alright at questing and defending as well…. lol.  And his lower starting threat really helps offset the higher cost of the other two.

Theoden - Thalin - Dain (33 threat) - I thought first pairing him with Thalin would help keep the starting threat down a little, but dropping Dain in with them kinda killed that idea.  I only threw this one together for the thought of finally making it worth questing Thalin every turn regardless.  With both Theoden and Dain's boosts in effect, Thalin quests for 3 (and wounds all the revealed enemies).  Having Dain in there allows for SoG, that will help pay for all the spendy red and purple cards this deck would surely have in it…  would still have to do some fancy footwork to deal with the higher threat, of course, but with Dain in, the "Sneak Attack+Gandalf" combo becomes an automatic…  And of course, there's all the nice dwarven cards to play off the two heroes…

Yes he does, this is also interesting because they obviously took it into account when deciding his threat cost of 12. His stats only sum up to 11 unless you add that extra 1 willpower, in which case his threat equals his stats.

Wow this guy looks very epic, i like Glaurung i agree that although his very good effect it´s not broken or ultra-powerful like Dain. I really like him and the new steed is a very amazing card. The Borormir, Theoden and Glorfindel combo that benhanses mentioned looks very epic and i´m really eager to try it out. By the way it seems that the last adventure in a cycle is introducing a big boss fight against a very strong enemy. This Nazgul looks very deadly (but we already battled a blood-thirsty balrog and a multi-attacking dragon so how worse could it be?) Okay joking aside i think this is going to introduce some effects that will make the Nazgul a very annoying (in a good way) enemy.

Tactics willpower boost…I'm crying…I love you Theoden…

I like Theoden but I wish his ability was more directed to Rohan than to the tactics sphere. Maybe because i feel that boosting traits should be done by those who are at the top of their herarchy:

- Dain (could have been THorin) after the Hobbit becomes the King of Dúrin's folk; so his ability (despite been too strong) isn't bad planned;

- Boromir (could have been Aragorn) was the Gondor great hope at the begining of the Lord of the Rings; so the Leadership Boromir ability is in one of the right Tolkien characters;

- to Rohan, who is left to give this kind of boosting?

 

 

As to the Steed of the Mark and the other Mount card, Asfaloth:

Whitout any other cards to give the traits or the sphere and the Against the Shadow cycle cards:

- we have only 3 heroes that can play the Steed on themselves (Dunhere, Eowyn and Eleanor);

- we have only 2 heroes that can play Asfaloth on themselves (Elrond and Lore Glorfindel);

 

Can be played yet on the following, but needs a spirit hero on the team or Song of Travel (for Steed) or Song of Wisdom (for Asfaloth) or Narvi's Belt: 

- Steed of the Mark can only be played on 7 other heroes (Beregond, both Boromir, Denethor, Prince Imrahil, Háma and Theodred);

- Asfaloth can only be played on 4 other heroes (Legolas, Elladan, Elrohir and Spirit Glorfindel);

 

The Steed ability is the same as the Core Aragorn's one.

But given the heroes where he can be played we have some of those heroes:

that are only designed to, on normal quests, do one thing (Eowyn - quest, Háma - attack, Beregond - defend). the last two are usually not worthy of having on quest because they have low (1) or no willpower and are not the prime candidates to give willpower boosts.

can do more than one thing. On these:

- Denethor usually uses his ability before questing, so doesn't have much benefict from the Steed ability;

- Theodred gives an simultaneous effect with the one from the Steed, so basically he would be questing and readying himself for 0 (it is better the UC);

- Tactics Boromir already have that ability with a different cost (threat rise)

- Leadership Boromir needs to have at least one resource to have his ability, so we could have a bit of problem with resources;

- Eleanor usefull but resource needed;

 

As to Asfaloth:

his ability is unique on heroes and has a boost if it rider is Glorfindel.

 

I love that they explore the traits… And that it integrates well with the other existing cards. But Steed of the Mark seems way too powerfull, in comparison to Asfaloth…

 

A bit like Dain in comparison with Leadership Boromir…

The Steed of the mark does not exhaust when it uses its ability. Could this allow the ability to be triggered multiple times and the questing power of the attached hero to count more than once?

Not technically true.

I think the way Dwarrowdelf Axe is worded, that it would do another damage to the Nazgul, if it was being used in the attack. Toss in a sneak attack Gandalf strike and that's three potential damage right there.

Plus there are cards that can put enemies into the staging area, which then opens him up to several other forms of additional attacks or direct damage. 

It wouldn't be all that hard to drop the Nazgul in a single turn. Provided you were prepared for such a thing.

Perhaps I'm misunderstanding you but there is a way to attach the new mount to other heroes…

Nor Am I A Stranger (Conflict at the Carrock): "Attach to a character. Attached character gains the Rohan trait."

Steward of Gondor (Core Set: "Attach to a hero. Attached hero gains the Gondor trait. Action: Exaust Steward of Gondor to add 2 resources to attached hero's resource pool."

Maybe you meant short of using either of these two cards, there are only 3 heroes?

No. A character can only commit to a quest once per round. This was firmly established with the core set Aragorn who has that exact same ability.

Likewise a character can only be used once to defend from a single attack and only used once when attacking a single enemy (until the next round of course).

I don't believe this would be possible. Even if the hero readied, it's still commited to the quest, so you'd not be able to commit and already commited character.

Thinking a great combo would actually be Theodan, Gimili, and Thalin then have a second deck with Dain…maybe even the famous/infamous Thorin and Co. deck to have tactics heroes that could all contribute 3 will power.

That said, its not really worth using Theodan in a solo tactics deck just for the sake of getting the most out of his ability because since most tactics heroes only have a 1 or 2 quest power its the same difference as including another hero from a different sphere whom already has a willpower of 2 or 3 while giving acess to a lot of other types of cards.  

Also while his effect will always be useful becasue it boosts himself, he really should be with at least 1 other hero who can take advantage of it otherwise unless u have a readying card (which are numerous these days) its better to have another character who can contribute 3 WP and have another effect or Legolas/Hama who can have 3 atk and another effect.

kind of just rambling but i'm still really excited by theodan. art is great too

still surprised he wasnt leadership

For solo, Théoden, Boromir (Tactics), Glorfindel (Spirit) seems best to me. But then again, Glorfindel makes any deck look good, basically, right now (except Dwarves perhaps). Questing for 8 and having enormous fighting prowess, that is some potential at the start of the game. And all that with Théoden certainly a better Dain in terms of balanced design, bravo ffg!

I do have second thoughts about the Steed, however, it does pale in comparison to Unexpected Courage (same sphere). Should have been cost 0 to rival that (and hardly still). Still hoping for Mount synergies however, that could sway things around.

As for the Nazgul, Gondorian Spearman is a great card to have, if I read the card well. How about the Scroll and Leader? Can anyone read (or guess) the whole thing? Will the Leader boost willpower to all Gondor characters?

Not sure if I like that new hero. However, the artwork is fantastic and probably one of the best we saw so far. I like the idea of making mono tactics decks workable, but solo players will still have to deal with the high threat cost and the fact that the only tactics hero who can be used more than once is Boromir. There aren't too many Rohan cards in the tactics sphere either.

Ok, one big plus is that you can use Theodenas a quester regardless of the keyword. This is one thing I really like about the keywords, as characters like Beravor or Imrahil become much more useful, as all of their good stats come into play instead of only one.

## 25 [Style75 on April 3, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/81747-final-ats-ap-pack-preview-the-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=780831)

Thanks for clarifying how you can't multi-commit to a quest with one character.

I still think, however, that the lack of exhaustion on this horse's ability is very significant. I'm making a prediction: there will be a card coming that will only work if you are able to exhaust a mount attachment similar to how we are seeing cards that exhaust weapon attachments. This would explain why the Steed is cost 1 instead of cost 0 and make it a bit more useful compared to unexpected courage.

I guess im missing why he is that great. I understand that tactics is despirate for will power, but a +1 is not THAT amazing. People keep saying he works really well for mono-sphere decks, but it what format? In a solo game, +1 will to each hero isn't that useful, when you really need your heroes available to do all sorts of tasks. At most, if you have allies available to do your combat, he's granting a +3 will power. I think you're still going to need to bring legolas along to make quest progress, and that means really, thats only a +2 since legolas wont be questing. Thats assuming you don't need one of your heroes to play attacker/defender.

In a multiplayer game, he's slightly more useful, assuming people are splashing tactics into their decks, but even then, how much tactics do you really need before you can say he's worth his 12 cost? If it was all tactics characters, or tactics characters + rohan characters…

 

as it stands, i can't see that he's the god send people say he is. But i'll reserve my true judgement for when i get to see what other cards combo with him.

Yeah, the Nazgul looks nasty.  Tough stats, takes at least 5 turns to kill,  and engagement threshold is only at 1.  

 

Not technically true.

I think the way Dwarrowdelf Axe is worded, that it would do another damage to the Nazgul, if it was being used in the attack. Toss in a sneak attack Gandalf strike and that's three potential damage right there.

Plus there are cards that can put enemies into the staging area, which then opens him up to several other forms of additional attacks or direct damage. 

It wouldn't be all that hard to drop the Nazgul in a single turn. Provided you were prepared for such a thing.



 

I'd have to look at all those scenarios to see what is actually allowable (I'm sure that there will be some ruling by FFG on them), but you are correct.  There are probably multiple ways to reduce the number of orunds to get rid of the Nazgul.  I intentionally wasn't figuring for any of those alternatives, just keeping it simple for the sake of the discussion, and for the point that not everyone will necessarily play those schemes.  To be more correct, I should have stated that he takes 5 turns to kill using a standard attack without manipulation.

Thanks for mentioning those possibilities… I'm sure they will become pretty handy (an be included in a few more decks) in playing that scenario later this year!

I think I’m in the minority here, but I have to agree w/ @Captain Poe—don’t see why Theoden is so great. I mean, his artwork is tied w/ Spirit Glorfindel for the BEST EVER and his stats are solid but…he’s too all over the place for me. I guess my problem w/ this guy is I can’t see where I would want to use him over another hero.
 
 
 
His ability, while in theory more flexible than Dain, is WAY less powerful as it only effects HEROES. I mean, I’m not saying it had to be another Dain w/ a straight +1/+1 for all tactics characters (or Rohan, or whatever), but the limit to heroes means that in a 4-player game you will almost never get more than +5 or 6 willpower (and remember—PRINTED tactics icon means that Song of Battle won’t allow you to spread this out over other heroes). And good luck EVER having that many tactics heroes that can afford to commit to the quest unless every player is also running some Spirit w/ UCs attaching all over the table.
 
 
 
As for his stats, they’re great—but he pays for them. A threat of 12 isn’t insurmountable but w/ an ability that lends him to being used in mono-tactics decks your threat will start to skyrocket quickly. A problem as if all the enemies are engaging your high-threat tactics team then they aren’t making good use of their boosted willpower (unless you’re playing Redhorn Gate, I suppose). I’m also not a big fan of “good at everything” heroes as generally anything greater than two good stats is wasted stat points (though this probably says more about my personal play-style).
 
 
 
It’s also worth noting that his ability works AGAINST the two lowest threat tactics heroes you could pair him with—Hama and Legolas. If they are both questing to take advantage of Theoden’s buff then unless you are using readying effects—which could probably be put to better use on Theoden himself due to his high stats—then they won’t be making use of their abilities as enemies will be revealed AFTER they commit. Maybe Brand can help smooth that out, but then you aren’t questing w/ HIM. Heck, I’m not even in love w/ the oft mentioned Boromir synergy as the threat cost to readying Boromir lowers the value of the +1 willpower.
 
 
 
For the record, I CAN see some interesting combos w/ him. He works great w/ Thalin and Gimli if another player has Dain and Spirit on the table. UC (and maybe Celebrian Stone) Gimli and keep Dain upright and he can quest for Eowyn levels, stand up, and then defend (in early game—once he has some damage he can start swinging back), all while Thalin is questing for 3 and picking away at every enemy that comes out. He also could become really powerful in 4-player games where 6-8 of the 12 heroes are tactics heroes, but that’s going to limit your option in a lot of quests.
 
 
 
I don’t know—that amazing art makes me want to love him but…I just don’t see it.

i tend to - tentaively - agree. but - it's hard to judge the final hero of a cycle in isolation, especialy when the theme of the cycle is building up mono-sphere decks.

Right. If Theoden gets his Asfaloth/Vilya equivalent the oppinion could change… but based on current card pool, i'd classify him as "just ok".

I know this is a "gondor" themed cycle, but it would still be nice to see something weave together all the Rohan cards we currently have to make them a decent archetype in their own right.  We're getting Theodan so maybe we'll get a suprise with Eomer too.

FFG has actually done a lot more with the Rohan trait than they have with either the noldor or silvan traits (remember, we got a lot of Rohan allies in Shadows of Mirkwood), but the game has moved away from that decks strengths. 

 
I think we are going to continue to see Rohan cards mostly connected to Gondor until we see a full Rohan deluxe expansion (which we likely won't see until after an elf themed expansion cycle, as they are currently the most underdeveloped race outside of hobbits).
 
But hey--that new steed of the mark makes me kind of want to go back and revisit my old Spirit/Leadership Rohan deck. It's a shame though that with the difficulty level of the current quests that deck is pretty much confined to Shadow of Mirkwood and the Core Set. Especially as I'm only rocking a single core set.

I think I'm less charitable than you. The more I think about him the less I like him. 

 
I can handle his threat cost and his wasted stat points--what gets me about him is that he ACTIVLEY synergies AGAINST almost ever other tactics hero (Thalin and MAYBE Gimli not withstanding). In almost all cases, if those other heroes are questing then you AREN'T using them to their best effect--especially as questing is before combat. 
 
I've got to say he would be WAY better if his ability was tactics "character" rather than hero. Or for that matter, if it was just "hero". 
 
Or if that's too OP, then just Rohan Heroes. That would at least buff Theodred and Eowyn and synergies with their abilities--and it would be a lot more thematic. 
 
I think the designers were trying a little too hard here to shoehorn in the mono-sphere theme of the cycle into this characters ability. I mean, they could have AT LEAST worded it like Burning Brand so we could use Song of Battle.
 
Now watch as they release "Theoden's Pony" and give him Dunhere's ability or "Theoden's Banner" that extends his buff to Rohan allies. At which point I will have to eat a lot of humble pie but as is I can't see why I would ever use him over other heroes.

Going back to the killing the Nazgul subject, couldn't you just use a bunch of Gondorian Spearmen and Spears of the Citadel + Stand Together to kill him, or at least seriously damage him, in one turn? It would be a little hard to get all of them out in time, but it might work.

Lol--you know something has gone terribly wrong when Landroval is being used as a readying effect (also, terribly AWESOME if you can pull it off to major affect).

 
Seriously though, that's awesome. I was pretty much ready to write him off as effectively unplayable (in the current card pool, of course--every card is a star waiting for the card pool to catch up to it).

Congrats, but yeah, that is pretty bad anyways, as one can make a core set deck to win Anduin at a very high rate. Mono-Tactics is far from playable still, and cards like Trained for War (a future event giving the battle keyword) are not going to change that, I feel. There needs to be a threat reduction (Gandalf just seems too expensive, and there is little card draw and resource acceleration) to stand a better chance.

As for the line-up, I'd guess Théoden, Thalin, Boromir be the best line-up right now as these are best fit for repeated questing. Starting 32, and having Boromir, you are in trouble, however.

As for the Nazgul, Gondorian Spearman is great, again! Initially I had thought his defense with Spear of the Citadel would have been reduced to 1 damage but now I see it is probably not true. So yes, that can be great help. I had also previously tried to incorporate Stand Together for this strategy but it has always seemed a card-slot(s) wasted. Maybe this will have me reconsider. Has anyone ever had succss with Stand Together?

Solo. Line-up was Theoden, Thalin and (after long evaluation) Beorn. The latter because you have to take the troll out quickly. I had two Eagles of the Misty Mountains and Radagast as additional questers, giving me 11 WP each round. Beorn, Landroval and Gondorian Spearman were my fighting crew.

I had to use Landroval during the last phase. The two cards I revealed were Dol Guldur Beast Master and the other Hill Troll.  My threat was at 48. And I couldn't prevent the troll from attacking. Fortunatly I had one of the eagles ready, backed up with two attachments. Unfortunatly it had already 3 damage and Beorn had seven. After almost giving up I found a way to solve the situation: I let the DG Beastmaster attack first, undefended. The damage was placed on Theoden, who was brought back by Landroval. I used Landroval as another attachment for the eagle instead of adding him to my hand and let the eagle defend against the hill troll. Fortunatly there was no bad shadow effect, so the eagle died, but I didn't have to raise my threat. Then Theoden, Beorn and a Veteran of Nanduhiron killed the troll while I cared for the DG Beastmaster during the next turn.

 

I agree that mono tactics is still very tough to play, but then we don't know which other tactics cards are in this cycle. I still felt like I had a lack of resources, cards and, of course, using characters more than once. Some tactics ally that readies another tactics character if he dies or something like that would be helpful.

 

Btw the other three games were two immediate losses and one game in which I almost made it through stage 2.

I still find it wierd that they would preview a spirit sphere card (the Steed) in an article about tactics monosphere decks. I think this is a hint that we're going to see a way to get those mounts out without requiring songs. I'm predicting that Theoden is going to get his own version of a Vilya type uber-card that will allow him to purchase (perhaps for free) mount cards from any sphere. It would be extremely thematic seeing as how the King of Rohan was always considered to be the Horse Lord. This would certainly boost Theoden's value, especially in a monosphere deck.

Thats possible, but I feel if they were going to do that they would need to release a lot more mount cards (remembering that the only other mount we have can only be equipped on a noldor or silvan hero), something I think they will save for a Rohan themed deluxe expansion/adventure cycle. Though maybe if it included a fetch effect it could still be used with the current card pool.

 

I think if a Theoden-specific attachment comes out it will likely be one that spreads his effect out to other Rohan characters and/or heroes (after all, it works SO well with Theodred and Eowyn). That would also give a pretty solid boost to the old mono-spirit Rohan deck if Theoden was across the table, and allow them to get the most out of their Steeds of the Mark.

I see him working really well in some kind of battle where you have multiple players playing with tactics and at a certain point you need a lot of willpower (like Peril in Pelargir or Into Ithilien). I think we're looking in the wrong place when we're trying to put him in a mono-tactics deck. He could also be great in a tactics minor spirit major Rohan deck that then pairs with a tactics deck

I think you might be onto something. I hope ffg is reading if they haven't thought about it yet. I think there must be something to justify the cost of Steed of the Mark. And if there isn't, I hope ffg is reading all the same and change the cost to 0 before printing it… haha.

Even if not specific to Theoden, we could surely see other cards interacting with mounts.  An ally like Master of the Forge or Bofur (tactics) pulling Mount cards out of your deck, or like Master of Lore reducing their cost.  Or even an event card with a play restriction akin to Elrond's Counsel, but reading "If you control at least 1 unique Rohan character, resources from any sphere may be spent to play Mount cards until the end of the phase."

I get the feeling that these previews are for multiplayer gamers. I remember that they once made a preview for TwitW in which they announced that finally secrecy decks would work. And then they added low threat tentacle enemies in this scenario! Perhaps not such a big problem if you played multiplayer, but for solo mode - really? Still like your idea. That's even better than my  1 cost "free beer" event in which Theoden would grant any character without any willpower + 1 WP.

You know, it’s weird. I agree 100% that Theoden needs some attachment love along the same lines as some of our Dwarrodelf heroes (Vilea, Light of Valinor, Asfaloth, Sword that Was Broken, Celabrian Stone) but disagree completely with your reasoning.

 

I think Steed of the Mark is GREAT. For a cost of 1 Spirit Resource you are essentially giving any Rohan or Gondor character (and remember, SoG grants the Gondor trait) Aragorn’s ability. Suddenly any resource-gain related ability (Gloin, Bifur, Theodred) becomes even more powerful. Wealth of Gondor? Now a readying effect. Hell, in a 4-player game I would even consider running Nor am I a Stranger w/ this. Is it as bat-crap amazing as UC? No. Nor is it as useful as the dirt cheap Cram—but it’s a reliable, predictable effect that can be used to great affect once you get some resource generation on the table.

 

Theoden, on the other hand, REALLY needs something to boost his value. I’ve gone over that already in this thread so I won’t repeat myself too much but he needs SOMETHING to make him worth his 1 greater threat cost vs stats (and yes, I know that his ability bounces him up to 12 but Bard has an effective stat cost of 13 most of the time, Elladan and Elrohir both have effective stat cost of 11, Dunhere, Eowyn—they all have slightly more situational abilities but in practice you are using them for their strengths).

 

All in all, I have to say I am not SUPER excited for this cycle. Think that’s just because I play most of my games 2-player, though. The focus on mono-sphere construction (and the liberal use of the “printed” modifier) means I would be locked out of 2 spheres for most of my games. Still, you never know—this could become my favorite cycle! I certainly love the narrative.

So, this isn't related to Theoden at all, but it looks like we're going to get more reliable event recycling cards in this cycle. If you look at the "Blood of Gondor" preview and at the "Morgul Vale" preview, it introduces the "Tome of Atanator" in the first one and "The Scroll of Isildur" in the second one.  If you piece these cards together, it looks like they say almost the exact same thing.  One says: "Reduce the cost of this card by 1 for each hero you control with the printed Lore resource icon.  Action: Discard Tome of Atanator to play a Lore event card in your discard pile as if it were in your hand. Then, put that event on the bottom of your deck."  The other says almost the exact same thing from the looks of it, except it's for Leadership instead.  Maybe we'll get one for each sphere?

Now THOSE are some cards I can get excited about. Hama's great but I have a hard time fitting him into multi-sphere decks with some of the other great tactics heroes we've been given.

 

Could definitly have some interesting uses paired w/ Stand and Fight, Horn of Gondor, Imrahil, and any cheap ally. Snowborn Scout comes to mind as an amazing defender to recycle.

And I disagree completely with yours. Of course you can find use for the card but that does not make it any better actually - that is if there are no further combos coming with it. As it is, it is just a bad card. I think it has been said over and over but if you cannot see it I will say it again, compare Steed of the Mark to Unexpected Courage. Steed costs 1, Courage 2. To get the readying effect out of it, you pay one extra, so there you already are equal in cost (true, the only slight advantage is that the second resource can be paid from another sphere; but that is really small advantage). Then, every other round, Steed costs 1 extra resource to get the effect Courage gets for free. Also, Courage can be used for any two actions, not just questing. Finally, Steed is restricted to Rohan and Gondor. Are you still to tell me the Steed is GREAT? I do not think that a card that is SO MUCH WORSE than another card which does the same thing and comes from the same sphere can be called good, let alone great.


 


[i tried to "quote" your message about the Steed being great but the software got me once more, so hope you know what I was talking about]

Yes, I wasn't sure what exactly they say but I think you're right. And it looks like a very exciting design. Good catch for piecing them together.

What do you think about Visionary Leader? What bonus does it grant, willpower?

And Legolas, aren't you turning a bit Beorning?

I still find it wierd that they would preview a spirit sphere card (the Steed) in an article about tactics monosphere decks. I think this is a hint that we're going to see a way to get those mounts out without requiring songs. I'm predicting that Theoden is going to get his own version of a Vilya type uber-card that will allow him to purchase (perhaps for free) mount cards from any sphere. It would be extremely thematic seeing as how the King of Rohan was always considered to be the Horse Lord. This would certainly boost Theoden's value, especially in a monosphere deck.

 

 

I think you might be onto something. I hope ffg is reading if they haven't thought about it yet. I think there must be something to justify the cost of Steed of the Mark. And if there isn't, I hope ffg is reading all the same and change the cost to 0 before printing it… haha.

I'm with you here. The 12 cost is way too much for his ability (especially as I lost two games because of 1 point threat too much). I don't think it has anything to do with readying him (why mentioning Steed of the Mark if that's the case?), but I hope for some card related to him that improves the tactics sphere. Perhaps some resource generating attachment?

Lol—yeah the software on this forum is truly, unbelievably bad. I figured out what you meant. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] As for Steed of the Mark—I think we may have to agree to disagree on that one but I will lay out my reasoning and some of the factors behind it.

 

First of all, and maybe most importantly, I only have one Core set (and all the adventure packs/deluxe expansions, plus 2 single SoGs that I was able to find on ebay). That means that while UC is an auto-include in every Spirit deck I make, I only have ONE of them. So I may have a somewhat healthier appreciation for ANY readying effect than most.

 

Secondly, I almost always include some kind of resource acceleration in my decks. This card gives those cards (like Horn of Gondor, Steward of Gondor, Wealth of Gondor) more flexibility. I can decide based on what’s on the table and in my hand if I would rather have a free quester that turn or the resource. To be clear, I don’t see this as Light of Valinor—I’m not using it every turn. But it’s a RELIABLE readying engine on the table that I can make use of when I don’t have a Cram or a Miruvor in hand. Hell—worst case scenario I use it a couple times and then it can become a shield for “discard attachment” treacheries.

 

And remember—it doesn’t have to go on my heroes. In a multiplayer game if another player is doing well on resources or has SoG out then I might throw it over to his side to power through the Quest deck. You’re probably looking at 6-12 progress for 3 resources over 3 rounds—not that much w/ Steward (which is the natural pairing here as it also grants the Gondor trait). Not that I would want to do that in EVERY quest (a lot of times there are better uses for the resources), but again—flexibility.

 

So yeah—reasoning. I can totally see where you’re coming from and it’s true that compared to UC this card is crap—but you aren’t running it INSTEAD of UC. I will say though that as much as I do still like the card a lot I will have to downgrade my “GREAT” to a “great” as I forgot about Miruvor (which if I had to choose, I like more for its different flavor of flexibility). Still, we WILL get a fetch card for the “mount” keyword (either in this cycle or in a future Rohan Deluxe Expansion) so I may bump it back up to “GREAT” yet. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I think we'll see some Spirit resource acceleration before we see another tactics generator.

 

I am hoping that if he does get some kind of specific attachment it revolves around Rohan (either extending his buff to them, providing a different buff, or fetching). He needs something thematically to tie him with other Rohan characters. I honestly don't really understand why he only buffs tactics heroes, thematically.

Well, I had to find a way to include both cards… Though now that I think about it, my name and my picture could be a bit confusing. reir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/reir.gif]  

But about Visionary Leader… I'm not sure. I think it will definitely be an attachment to put on Leadership Boromir, as you can make out that it says "While attached hero has at least one resource in it's resource pool." A good guess would be Willpower, but I don't know. It could just as easily be attack or defense, since this cycle is sure to have Battles and Sieges.

Hmm, not really sure about Theoden. He's interesting, yes, but I think that the measure they're taking to help Tactics may be a bit of a mistake. You see, as we may all know, one of this game's most important characteristics/problems (at least in solo) is that of the three "winning conditions" it has (questing, defending, attacking) you need the three of them to win actually a game (unlike magic in which you can win by pure aggro, pure control, etc). So you can't really give Tactics what really should be mostly exclusive to Spirit. I they want to help Tactics put Progress tokens on the quest/locations why not basing this measure on Legolas? It's just so obvious. He's been there since the beggining, and he is in my opinion the best way to do this. Why not make a hero with, say, an ability like "Whenever this hero defends and recieves no damage, put one progress token on target location/quest"? Or an event that is Legolas' ability, like "Choose a hero. If that hero attacked and detroyed an enemy this turn, place two progress token on the current quest". That would help Tactics a LOT in becoming a viable sphere for mono-sphere decks, and it would still make Tactics stay Tactics.

The Legolas/Blade of Gondolin ability seems like a good way for Tactics to make quest progress while still feeling like Tactics, but in practice it has a fatal flaw.  If you draw few or no enemies from the encounter deck - which can easily happen in a solo game when you're only drawing 1 new card per turn - the ability is useless.  This is one of the main reasons that the core set Tactics deck is noticeably worse than the others and struggles to defeat even Passage through Mirkwood.  100% agree that each sphere should have its strengths and weaknesses, but in the case of Tactics it has a much harder time making up for its weaknesses than the other spheres.

The more I think about it, the more I think that the way they created Theoden is smart. His ability is a major help at the start of the game where tactics suffers the most questwise. Later you can add enough allies to pimp your WP to 10 points and more. Which is more than enough for most of the scenarios.

Example:

Theoden - 3 WP

Thalin - 2 WP

Bofur - 2WP

Eagles of the MM - 2 WP

Envoy of Pelargir - 1 WP

 

You could play these allies in 3-4 rounds. There's also Radagast, Landroval and Gandalf to help you boost your WP.

 

I think balancing tactics is going to be brutal. This sphere has the potential to become too powerful. Right now it mainly lacks threat managment and healing. If you can handle these two, you can take your time to build yourself an unbeatable army of allies, weapons and fighting events. Right now that's not the case which sets a tight countdown for each tactics deck. That is good IMO, but tactics is still lacking some strength. FFG has to walk a fine line between strenghtening the tactics sphere just a bit more without making it overpowered.

Jonof, I get your point. I hope I did not sound too harsh the last time around. Though my little playing group owns multiple core sets I am mostly inclined to use one copy of UC anyways. And it is also that I mostly use heroes that do not need it as much - Glorfindel gets Light of Valinor, Frodo gets Fast Hitch, Boromir has his own readying effect, Beravor no longer applies that much, Beregond can take Behind Strong Walls, Dain and Thorin could use Cram (their sphere) and recycle it with the Hammersmith; guys like Théodred don't really need it or are of different spheres… It is mostly Denethor or Elrond who are made for Courages, it seems, and will hardly do without. But Théoden now is certainly another candidate.

I guess you're right. I immediately thought of the possibility of there being few enemies in the quest after I posted my comment, but I would still support a Tactics sub-strategy of placing tokens during/after the combat phase. That may not be the whole solution, but that and also having more willpower allies and heroes and lower threat heroes would be the way to go in my opinion. I also believe Trained for War will become a very important card in future Tactics decks.

Yes.

 

Look, even I am getting sick of me talking about Theoden at this point but I will say that his design kind of worries me for the direction the cycle will go.

 

It’s like they had a list of characters that they wanted to use for heroes, thematically, and designed some really cool abilities for them. And then they had this great idea that this cycle should address one of the legitimate shortcomings of the game (the difficulty of playing mono-sphere). And then they just slammed the two together.

 

I don’t know, I could be completely wrong but when I look at Theoden it feels like he was supposed to be the Rohan Dain Ironfoot, but was ruined by committee. Like his ability was originally conceived as “Rohan characters get +1 willpower while Theoden is in play (or maybe commited to the quest)”. Still not as powerful as Dain without the attack boost (and more expensive in threat cost) but more personally versatile as he didn’t have to be ready and a thematic home run. And then someone decided that they wanted to support mono-sphere, so it became “tactics characters get +1 willpower”. And then somebody (rightly) pointed out that that was insanely OP so it was changed to “heroes with a printed tactics icon”.

 

And you know, Theoden is one card so it’s not a huge deal but I really hope that isn’t indicative of how the mono-sphere theme will be applies to other cards in the cycle.

Lol--no worries. Not harsh. It really does all come down to play style. I play a lot of high threat/high stat heroes so any time I can stand one up after questing is a good thing.

You see, as we may all know, one of this game's most important characteristics/problems (at least in solo) is that of the three "winning conditions" it has (questing, defending, attacking) you need the three of them to win actually a game (unlike magic in which you can win by pure aggro, pure control, etc). So you can't really give Tactics what really should be mostly exclusive to Spirit. I they want to help Tactics put Progress tokens on the quest/locations why not basing this measure on Legolas? It's just so obvious. He's been there since the beggining, and he is in my opinion the best way to do this. Why not make a hero with, say, an ability like "Whenever this hero defends and recieves no damage, put one progress token on target location/quest"? Or an event that is Legolas' ability, like "Choose a hero. If that hero attacked and detroyed an enemy this turn, place two progress token on the current quest". That would help Tactics a LOT in becoming a viable sphere for mono-sphere decks, and it would still make Tactics stay Tactics.

 



Great point!

I like the progress token bonus path for tactics.

Yeah, I too hugely value the great differences between the spheres. It is one aspect that makes this game special for me. I hope (and believe) ffg is on the right track still. It is very difficult. And Tactics have had the shaft from the start, as well as Spirit had the vanilla. I am intrigued by the idea of mono-sphere. I do not think Théoden will make Tactics a willpower sphere, it is just a slight boost, heroes are few. And he strengthens the fact Tactics get better the more players are in the game.

As for ideas, I really like the progress bonus for defending. It'd be great to have such attachment - a weapon - for Beregond.

As for the shortcomings, threat reductions seems to me to be by far the biggest trouble of the mono-Tactics deck (moreso solo, of course). It is strange that Dwalin (Spirit hero) got the ability he did, for if ever Tactics could get threat reduction, it would probably be most fit to be connected (though again) with destroying enemies, right?

The more I think about it, the more I begin to believe Visionary Leader will boost willpower. I know it might be strange in a cycle concentrating on battle and siege mechanic, but if one is to make a Leadership mono-sphere, willpower is going to be needed too. It has not been discussed much but Leadership heroes so far do not run high willpower either (aside from Dwarves). Of course, there is Faramir ally, and Gandalf can be accessed well in mono-Leadership but the heroes will need their boost, I feel, and so will Gondorians. I also expect Faramir hero to be Leadership (staying in the sphere as Bifur, Dwalin, Gloin, or Beorn did) so that may cancel out having him as an ally willpower booster.

Or hey, how about an Event that reads "Response: After a <tactics> hero attacks and destroys an enemy, place progress tokens on the current quest equal to the <willpower> of that hero."

Why not have your cake and eat it too?  Synergizes with Theoden.

Yes. I think the willpower is definitely a possible one.  But possibly hit points??? After all, "Hardy Leadership" with the dwarves gives them +1 Hit Point. But Gondor is most likely a different boost, and I don't think "Visionary" would be a hint to getting more hit points. Oh well. Guess we'll see whenever it comes out!

"Visionary", if ti is an hint, i would say willpower. Because, as far as i know, only Faramir and Imrahil have 2 willpower (which are the higher in Gondor characters(

Agreed—the forums are kind of dead.

 

For the record, I don’t think we need more spoilers. We get plenty enough of those and FFG has an unfortunate habit of spoiling the best cards in there Adventure Packs before release (which, I guess, makes sense from a marketing standpoint but I like being surprised when I open my packs).

 

What I think we need more of is articles IN GENERAL. Way back in the day we used to get a lot of deck building articles, flavor articles, even just “feature” articles (like the “what kind of player are you” from way back in Mirkwood). Just something to get discussion moving. I would love more of that. Or even just community interaction stuff—“Hey guys, we’re having a Core set weekend. Revisit the first few quests and test yourself against the Nazgul one more time! Here’s a Youtube video of us running the first three quests in “campaign mode” and a list of the deck we used. Come join us, comment, or post your own games as video responses.”

 

I mean, I know the guys at FFG are busy but the longevity of their games could really be helped by a little more effort on the forums/website (after all, most of us don’t live close enough to go to one of their events).

 

Just my 2 cents, anyway.

And 2 cents well spent. Agreee 100% with you.

 

They need to give us more attention but not on articles giving inside of the packs;

i agree we need more input from ffg….no surprise there though right?

but i also would love to see more tolkien directed articles…i mean thats what this is all about afterall….the lore. you can make articles on how to build decks, card spoilers, tournament rules, faqs and so on, but at the end of it, we are all here because of the amazing world tolkien created….and i think that is what keeps this game above the other lcgs (well i think that, i know some will disagree here haha)

This is what I thought immediatly as well: boosting another +1 ATK would be way too good because of Leadership Boromir, +1 DEF would make sense, but why would this be called "Visionary XXX", and finally +1 HP already exists and is for Dwarves. By elimination, there's only Willpower left.

Yes. I don't think it would or could do anything else.  But if it is willpower, a Gondor deck built around that card plus a Rohan deck would be devastating during the quest phase, since Rohan's willpower is already amazing.

Yes, and mind Mutual Accord, now both Gondor and Rohan forces get the boost for a phase (plus they could use Astonishing Speed); however, quests are still not won just like that, but boosting willpower is certainly what Gondor needs; and I really can't wait for this cycle as I want to make more thematic dekcs, and Gondor is hardly an option right now…
