## 1 [General_Grievous on October 3, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300759-premium-packs/?do=findComment&comment=3798926)

So with today's announcement of the premium pack for GoT LCG and that game's similar release model, it made me wonder if this is the new model that has been hinted for us as well? Take a read through the preview and there are many things that could be implemented here:

-Re-releasing cards in their post errata form for those that want that.

-Updating old cards to modern standards (looking at you To the Eyrie!), similar to the Ancient Mathoms community project that is seeking to rebalance and by extension revitalize old cards.

-On a similar vein weaker heroes could be looked at and adjusted accordingly, there are some hobbits in general that I know would love some toning up.

-Adding missing traits on cards, such as Eagle on the Eagle Attachment cards, and things like Healer on the first cycle cards that are missing it.

-What could also be done is upgrading old Quests in a sort of thematic campaign style even using the same encounter cards but different rules and quest cards/boons/burdens and player card locations to up the difficulty and flesh out some more story, especially for the early cycle stuff that was fairly weak on story.

 

So could this be a preview for what's to come?

I quite like the idea of the premium packs. I'm not sure what it would entail for the game (possibly all the cards needed for a quest and so many new player cards).

This is what I was most expecting. How do we expect this will be done? Will the packs correspond to the Saga and its APs or will it probably just be one pack and that's it? I'm guessing we could get an indication from the AGoT LCG. Do we know from the preview how great the range of updated cards is from?

Apparently 88 cards so sounds like all of the weak cards in one cycle? I imagine that there will be one per cycle because then they can keep it going, but they could just do one and be done. It's mostly for the first two cycles that really need it. And maybe the Hobbit saga haha

Neat! 

But the article also goes on to note that FFGOP will no longer be supporting Game of Thrones The Card Game with events... does this likely bode for LotR LCG no longer having Fellowships or other events either?

I sure hope not, plus I feel like LOTR is much more active and popular but that's just my experience

I’m still concerned about the ‘break’ and why a ‘break’ is needed?  My guess is that there is no plan, just that they do ‘plan’ to come back, and know when/if they do, it’ll be ‘different ‘

That's not what AGoT is doing. The new chapters are all new cards for the 2.0 version. They are not rereleasing errata'd cards or revisiting existing cycles for the 2.0 version. The "update" means they are transitioning cards from the 1.0 version to 2.0. They are just reusing old stuff so the game has something to look forward to, while devs do something else (unclear if that something else is what LotR is going to do too, or it's another game).

LotR can't implement something like that, so that's why we are having a break.

A break until they have info from the Amazon TV show perhaps?
