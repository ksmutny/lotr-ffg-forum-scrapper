After reading Master of Lore's most recent article [http://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/03/09/fight-at-the-fords/], I was inspired to take his advice and read a bit from the Unfinished Tales about the battles at the Fords of Isen [http://www.ae-lib.org.ua/texts-c/tolkien__unfinished_tales__en.htm#3-5].
 
I had always thought Dunhere to be a creation of FFG-- I remember hearing somewhere that Dunhere, Beravor, and Eleanor were FFG creations and used in a previous Middle-earth themed game.  But there in the print was his name, and even a footnote that gave him a bit of substance:
 
13 A valiant captain, nephew of Erkenbrand. By courage and skill in arms he survived the disaster of the Fords, but fell in the Battle of the Pelennor, to the great grief of Westfold. [Author's note.] - Dúnhere was Lord of Harrowdale (The Return of the King V 3).

 

Just thought I would share this with others who are curious about the lore, but haven't come across this bit.  Now I wonder, are Eleanor and Beravor purely FFG creations, or is there a footnote out there for them, too?

 

EDIT: I guess it is Thalin that was an FFG creation, that's what I was forgetting.  Unless I am mistaken about that as well!

I always thought Eleanor was Sam and Rosie's daughter.

Eleanor, Beravor, and Thalin are 100% FFG creations, and they all come from the Middle Earth quest board game, where all of the heroes you could choose were made up by FFG (there was also a Rohan character, which I can't remember the name of at the moment).

 

Mirlonde and Caldara are also FFG creations.

I actually meant to say in my post "I always assumed...until Ian from TFtC pointedly out to me." You're a wealth of knowledge!

Eometh. There was also Argalad, an Elf of the Woodland Realm.

That's right, I forgot about the Elf. I think Mirlonde replaced Argolad in some senses, while Eleanor and Beravor were included to make up for the lack of female characters (not sure why Thalin made the Core Set, but I've got a soft spot for him!)

 

Edit: I should say, I think that's why they were included, don't know for sure!
