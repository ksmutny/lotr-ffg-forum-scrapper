Well, the big dance is only a week away.  I am surprised that we do not have any news on Shadow by now.  My best guess now is that it will be available at GenCon. I have to admit I was hoping to hear that the Hobbit Saga was to be available next week as well, but I have my doubts.

I don't mean to complain to loudly…..I sure wish that we could have a little more information up front to be able to budget the money expeditures.

There's almost no way (except that it will be at GenCon). How long will it take to get out to stores, another week or two? Still that's earlier than I thought.

 So this year at GenCon there will be a Battle of Laketown contest.  Last year they had Massing, but even before GenCon there was talk about Massing being available PoD.  Has there been anything about Laketown being available PoD?

to the best of my knowledge, they have not officially declared this (in fact, the only info available re: the quest is on the GenCon website), but there is no reason to suspect they wouldn't offer this as POD.

Wow, it did not take long to find out your wrong.  Rick, I checked my usual online store and they told me next week on Shadow.  Good news, I will pick up both next week at GenCon.  Thanks for the response.

He's not wrong, per se.  It's already in physical stores.  Your ONLINE store is getting it late.   As is mine, but I'm saving $$$ that way, so….
