 Hey guys, I haven't gotten to play past the Mirkwood cycle.  My question is this: are expansions like the Hobbit one and the Heirs of Numernor playable without the original core set?  Thanks!

nothing is playable without the original core set

well….i mean you could if your card pool is large enough with later packs, you have the threat trackers and icons for damage etc….but to answer in short- no
