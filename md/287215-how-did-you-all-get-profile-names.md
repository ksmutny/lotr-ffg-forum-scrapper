Getting tired of being player-string of numbers.  Tried on a number of occasions to change it.  Is it something I just pushed past when I first set up my account and now I'm doomed to stay like this? Thanks in advance

There is a way to change your name:

Click on the dropdown menu on the upper right and choose profile. Then click on asmodee.net account in the left column, go to profile again and change your username.

Did that a long time ago and again recently. I have an actual name on asmodee just not on FFG. Thanks though!

Googeling I have found the following:

“1,683,311 is an odd composite number composed of two prime numbers multiplied together.”

We can call you Prime, short for Optimus Prime if you want.

Well, Optimus Composite, really.

It worked for me though. Some weeks ago I also had a player####### name.
