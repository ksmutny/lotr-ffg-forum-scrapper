nice boxes! having all those empty red spots on the game mat would drive me nuts, haha. I have the FFG 4 player mat that has outlines for the encounter deck which I like. The 4 player mat seems just the right size for me playing solo.

All right, I'll bite.Â  Where did you get the boxes?

Broken token makes inserts for an existing box made by hobby lobby, I had themÂ screen printed!

AFAIK, Hobby Lobby has discontinued that line of boxes. I fortunately found returned and lightly damaged copy (that location's last), but from now on I think Broken Token's more expensive box is the only one available. Hobby Lobby told me they had stopped producing that line of wooden products. ðŸ˜•

Nice.Â  I was afraid you were trying to sell something for a minute there.
