As a new player to the game I am looking at getting past the core set now - any idea when/if Dwarrowdelf cycle is due for a reprint and restock, I've not been able to find it anywhere!

I've been waiti g for it for a long time as well. I don't know when Asmodee NA will reprint it, but they should in the near future.

I've been waiting around two years for it. (It was reprinted in that time, but during a point where I wasn't paying close attention and I missed it.)

 

I would recommend skipping it for now. Once it's in print pick it up, but skip ahead to a more recent cycle that is currently in stock.

I asked this also recently, and sounds like it could be soon, or six months or longer (not soon in my estimation).  I found a Khazzad-Dum box at a local store a few weeks back, so it is out there, and stuff comes up on ebay from that cycle, often at pretty low prices (above MSRP, however), but gets snatched up FAST.  It's too bad it's not in stock because some of the strongest player cards are from that cycle--though they aren't mandatory for even hard quests because the card pool has grown so much.

I just skipped it.  There’s so much out there to get.  Once it’s available in my area I’ll pick it up
