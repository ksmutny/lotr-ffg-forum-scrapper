Hiya !

I know that would be a dum question for some but what are winning conditions ?

Example : I have enough progress tokens on quest card after Journey phase and I have met all the requirements that are on last scenario card. Do I end the game in that moment or I need to go through all phases till end of the round ? What about enemies/locations in staging area and those I fight with ?

You advance to the next stage as soon an you have enough progress tokens on the current stage of the quest. (Page 22, Quest Advancement) If you manage to complete the final stage of the quest then you win. So you would win immediately when you place the last progress token on the quest. Generally you win during the Travel phase but occasionally during the Combat phase when you need to kill some Enemy.Â

So I don't care about any enemies/locations that are in staging area and enemies that are engaged with me when all requirements to win are met right ?

I also don't need to go through all seven phases of one round to win correct ?
