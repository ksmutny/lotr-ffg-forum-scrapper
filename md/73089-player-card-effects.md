 This is something I've been pondering for a while, and can't seem to find a definitive answer for

 

Are heroes player cards?

 

for example, can Legolas put progress tokens on the Carrock, can Core Set Glorfindel heal Beorn or Bilbo when he's in the riddling area (with Elrond boosting the power of that healing)

 Yeah, heroes' abilities count as "player card effects."

 shame.

 

Is there an official source for that?

 You know, I can't find anything that explicitly defines hero cards as a type of player card.  I can see how one would think they might not be (the game manual lists the game contents as being "120 player cards" and "12 hero cards").  But I think it is commonly held that Legolas can't place tokens on the Carrock, Glorfindel can't heal Beorn, and so on.  You'd have a lot of jaws dropping if that turned out to be false, but I'm with you-- would like to see official confirmation.  It probably exists, I just don't know where to find it.
