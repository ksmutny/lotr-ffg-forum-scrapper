And the Grey Havens just passed 6.

Elves are better navigators the Italians.

Any day now?

Obviously a thematic gesture on FFG's part.  It's status will remain "on the boat" even after it hits store shelves.

 

Instead of the Upcoming page update, T-Pain will announce the imminent arrival of the cargo ship.

But that would imply FFG's products are actually on time. Might as well say unicorns are real.

Seven weeks now.  Maybe FFG could get those British female rowers to ferry the product back and forth across the Pacific.

Or they could buy some printers...

It is taking a while isn't it? Was there a traffic jam on the ocean or something? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

In the meantime, let's create a "Is this game dying?" thread. :-)

Man, the real question is: are the marketing services of FFG dying? Or striking? Or whatever? Cos we're like 2 months after the 4-5-6 APs have been released and still no rule insert in the support section. And thus, not on the quest companion.

Life is good if you like Star Wars though.

> "Shipping now."

So in FFG-Speak that means next two weeks?
