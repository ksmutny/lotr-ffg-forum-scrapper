If I have three Mirkwood Runners in play, can I attack a monster three separate times with each Mirkwood Runner so I can use their ability to cancel the armour of the monster?

 

Thank you,

You're only allowed to declare one attack against an enemy, per player.  So you could only use 1 Mirkwood Runner (or use 2 or 3 at once).  

 

There are card effects that allow you to declare additional attacks, however.  You can use the Quick Strike tactics event to declare an attack which does not consume your "once per round" limit.

Thank you for the clarification GrandSpleen.
