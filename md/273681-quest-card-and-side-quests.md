If the Quest card has a the Battle or Siege keyword, but the players choose a side quest without keywords as the main quest, do still abilities such as that of the Southron Company [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Heirs-of-Numenor/Southron-Company.jpg] (Southron Company gets +2 threat-small.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/threat-small.png] and +2 attack-small.png [http://hallofbeorn.com/Images/attack-small.png]while the current quest card has the battle [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Search?Keyword=Battle.] or siege [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Search?Keyword=Siege.] keyword.) still apply?

In the case of Southron Company, the ability does not apply while the side quest is current.

But remember: side quests can generally only be "current" during the quest phase, as the rules revert the current quest to the main quest during other phases. So you can't use a side quest to debuff the Southron Company's attack during the combat phase.
