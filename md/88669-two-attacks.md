So when an enemy attacks, you declare a defender, and he gets a shadow card that says "Attacking enemy attacks again after this attack. (deal it a new shadow card)", does he

 

1. Attack the same defender again undefended since you exhausted the defending character for the first attack

 

2. Attack the same defender again, but the defender counts his defense because he did not exhaust from the first attack yet.   

 

3. Attack any other available character that you have under your control.  The defender from the first attack is now exhausted.  

 

 

Thanks

The answer is nomber 3. And he never attacks a character. The enemies attack the player who then deside to defend or not. If he defends he choses a chracter to defend. So in the given example the first attack will resolve around the defending character and then you choose again if you wanna defend or not with a new character.

And remember you've got to exhaust your defender before looking at the shadow card!
