I just need to know when the New FAQ will come out?????  There is some info about it somewhere????

I think we already have a lot of questions since the last FAQ was release 3 months ago......

There doesn't seem to be any official information about it, but I am sort of guessing that it will come out shortly after the release of Return to Mirkwood, just so all the AP questions can be bundled together.

That's absolutely true, but I don't have any clue.
I used the FAQ a lot, and am looking weekly in the slot,
which FFG reserved on their page for the support,
hopefully it's not delayed again by the efforts of the Dark Lord!

How about using the unofficial FAQ? I have used that even more than the official :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] you can find it here:

Agreed, this is a very nice resource, and the author is pretty swift to respond to errors or clarifications.
