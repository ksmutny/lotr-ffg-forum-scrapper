# [Reference Sheet with Player Actions](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279143-reference-sheet-with-player-actions/)

Sorry, I'm sure this has been asked before but the search function just keeps erroring out for me when I try to search for anything.

 

Is there an updated, printable round reference sheet out there with the player actions all shown?  All I can seem to find are really old sheets, and I'm not sure what has changed with FAQ's and stuff and want to make sure I have the latest/greatest.

 

Thanks!

AFAIK no simple reference sheet has been updated since the release of the Rules Reference—https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/90/19/90191e4e-a341-4379-b398-5963b7a87ebf/mec01_online_only_rules_reference_for_website.pdf [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/90/19/90191e4e-a341-4379-b398-5963b7a87ebf/mec01_online_only_rules_reference_for_website.pdf]—but p. 20–22 of that document has a graphical summary that's quite a bit clearer than the one in the original Core rulebook.

(Note that the RR changed some very subtle things about the round framework, e.g., the action window labeled "6.4" in the oft-mentioned kaybee quick reference no longer exists. While the changes are usually inconsequential, if you're interested in a letter-perfect separate reference sheet, it does not yet exist.)

I was working on an aide-memoire - a series of "phase cards", which I had included all the steps for each phase, including the player action windows.

Then I saw that someone on the LOTR LCG Players Facebook group has been doing exactly the same thing - a series of printable cards which show the phases of the game, and when you can make player actions.  Freaky coincidence, but he's done a very nice job.  It's in early stages, but I would hope they'll be released (on BGG for example) once complete.

I think he explicitly cited ryno's player aid as inspiration, which remains to me the best-looking, most functional version of this sort of thing:

I see the appeal of a playing-card-size set of aids, but in the end I think the larger size just makes more sense.
