I have compiled a list of fan-made quests and game modes that you might want to try out. With so much official content still on the boat, we might as well turn towards fan-made variants. The list can be found here: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/05/11/fan-made-content-game-modes-and-quests/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/05/11/fan-made-content-game-modes-and-quests/]

If you have any additions to this list, feel free to post them in the comments and I will update the list as soon as possible.

Thanks for the support and have fun with exploring these new corners of Middle Earth!
