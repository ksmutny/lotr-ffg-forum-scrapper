Is it 'standard' for ALL adventure packs to have 3 quests (1a/1b, 2a/2b, 3a/3b) respectively?

Or, do some APs have less or even some can have more than 3 ?

 

Thanks

Some adventure packs have 3 quest cards, but within even the first cycle (Shadows of Mirkwood), there are quests with 1, 2, 3, and as many as 4 quest cards. Another possibility seen already in the core set is for there to be multiple potential "b-sides" of quest cards depending on the theme of the scenario.

Ah yes, "alternate" endings to quests, I so do welcome. Keeps the game "living" even more!  Thank you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
