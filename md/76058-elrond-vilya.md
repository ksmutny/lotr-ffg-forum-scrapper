Can be Vilya used to play an ally of any sphere ?

May be it is obvious or it has been already answered somewhere else but because I think it's too powerful I've got some doubts.

Ally, event, attachment, yep.  Any sphere, even no-sphere cards (neutral).

Sorry about thread necromancy, but is this correct? My understanding is that Elrond can summon allies of any sphere, with or without Vilya, and that Vilya gives him access to the Spirit sphere. But Tactics and Leadership events and attachments?

 

EDIT: Ah, clarification: Vilya's special ability does not require a resource match. So with this, you can play Leadership and Tactics cards from the deck if you know they are coming.

Yea, playing His Royal Brokenness, Lord Elrond, the best strategy I've found is to get Vilya on the board ASAP.  He becomes a quest-crusher at that point.  It's pretty sweet.
