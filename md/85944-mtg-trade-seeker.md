Hopefully this is not inapprorpiate to post here, I will delete if so.  I am trying to find a trade partner for my MTG collection (many older rares like Demonic Tutor, Enlightened Tutor, etc. across many early expansions) in order to get a large/complete LOTR LCG collection.  Please let me know if anyone is interested.  I am in TX.
