i mean are the news previews will still be coming up at the top of the page?

the reason i ask is that i have the forum directly bookmarked so i always arrive on that page, rather than navigate to here from the main page, hence i never see the news page

no worries.. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]  though im confused as to whether my question seems serious or not. it is meant to be serious. what i mean is whether the news previews will still be coming up at the top of the page

the reason i ask is that i have the forum directly bookmarked so i always arrive on that page, rather than navigate to here from the main page, hence i never see the news page

 

of course, you can go to check the news page, but its quicker to have a banner at the top right? that way more people see it.

I guess it's better, I access this page just by typing an "l" in my chrome bar that autocompletes into lordoftheringslcg.com, that way I check for preview first, then I go to the forums.

ahh I'm with rich.  i press "f" on my google chrome bar and go straight to the LOTR LDG main topics forum place.  Yeah to me it seems like this new forum change is an old looking one and the one we had before would be the new one.  This new forum thing looks alot more like a message board were people say short things and many, more than a forum if you know what i mean
