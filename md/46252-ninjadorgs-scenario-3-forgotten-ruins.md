Cool quest NinjaDorg. Looks interesting to play - also looks nasty with players having to defeat both US and the Nazgul, plus the other critters that could be found in the encounter deck.

Yeah, I was aiming for something a bit harder than the Anduin quest but not as hard as Escape from Dol Guldur.

Hey there,

 

Sorry for the thread resurrection but its taken me a while to get some free time to try this scenario out.  Tried this scenario out a couple of games over the last few days with a Leadership/Lore deck and a Spirit/Tactics deck.  Both did pretty darn well against the scenario and it got me thinking about why that was and how you could up the difficulty a little.  Please take the following as constructive criticism.

 

First - I like the flavor a lot and will try to make my comment continue to hold to that flavor.

 

1B - The main issue I felt here was that there is nothing on in the staging area at the start allowing the player an easy start.  Unlike "Passage Though Mirkwood" where you start with The Old Forest Road and a Forest Spider in Play or "Journey Down the Anduin" where you have the Hill Troll and 1 card per player, this scenario starts with nothing on the board which I think is meant to make up for the fact that you have to deal with Ungoliant's Spawn at the end of it but really gives the players an easy start.

Since this section of the scenario stresses the spiders and forest maybe it begins with a Great Forest Web in play to put some threat on the board.  The other option is a King Spider but that's a pretty powerful creature with 3 damage and a low engagement cost which is sure the engage the players on turn 1.

 

2B - Here I discovered an issue with the Shadow Key.  While the players cannot avoid the threat increase for taking the Shadow Key... the can avoid its damage every round effect.  If the players simply get 8 progress tokens on the quest then wait till the planning phase of the next turn they can take the action to gain the shadow key which automatically completes the 2B quest moving them to the 3A quest where the Shadow Key is discarded.

While there is a small chance that the Dungeon Jailor could show up and remove the Shadow Key... this outcome is fairly minimal.  They players can play the waiting game and if the Dungeon Jailor shows up in the Quest phase they get an action window to grab the Shadow Key before the Quest phase is resolved.

I would suggest making picking the shadow key up early a greater priority.  Perhaps for every progress token added to the quest, add a progress token to the Shadow Key.  For every progress token on the Shadow Key increase the players threat by an additional +1 when they acquire the Shadow Key.  Alternately a less brutal version might simply to put a progress token on the Shadow Key at the end of each turn.

Also of the four times I played this scenario three times the Shadow Key was unguarded (i.e. I drew a treachery).  From a flavor point of view I'd love for the Shadow Key to be guarded by a creature.  I wonder is having it guarded by a Cavern Guardian rather than a random card draw might not be the way to go.  Cavern Guardians are pretty easy to deal with though so for a slightly harder option I might give the Cavern Guardian a bonus to its defense while the Shadow Key is attached... maybe a +2 defense to make it something to deal with.

 

3B - Didn't really have any problems here except that the players have had a good chance to build up by this point and generally I had most of the staging area clear by the time I got to the Nazgul so I could generally afford to sacrifice an ally to it and all out attack it, knocking it down in a round or two.  It would pose much more of a threat if it had some henchmen to force the players to spread their wealth a bit such as a Cavern Guardian or two (sticking with the undead theme.)  You could take of leave this.

 

Anyways fun scenario and concept.  These are just some thoughts.  Hope to try them out in the next few days and will report back.

 

All the best,

Considering that you can't place any progress tokens on the quest unless a Hero controls the Shadow Key this shouldn't be an issue.

 Another cool scenario! 

Where do you get the artwork from?

Thanks for all your detailed feedback, Wraith and I hope you enjoyed it.  The following is a pretty crucial point though:

As Apophenia says you need the Shadow Key to get anywhere on Stage 2B.  You might like to try it again with this rule in effect as 2B should be difficult enough to make the Nazgul a significant threat later on.  Failing that, feel free to tweak the quest how you like to make it more or less difficult.  We only play with one core set and usually two players, so this is a pretty tough quest for us!
