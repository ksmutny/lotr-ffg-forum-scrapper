Hi guys,

if the encounter card is a treachery, I know that I need to discard cards until a valid enemy or location comes up but do the treachery cards resolve?

I found an old thread but I still have the doubt about the treachery cards.

Regards

If you discard it, you don't have to resolve any effect of the card.

Since the cards are discarded and not revealed they don't have effect, no matter their type. That's also one of the nice uses of the Guarded cards, if you now in the remaining encounter deck there are quite a lot of treacheries that's one way to get rid of them.

Thank you guys,

I have another doubt, I would think that the cards are revealed before they are discarded, following this idea shouldn't the treachery cards be resolved before discarded?

Regards

"Revealed" has a very specific meaning in this game, separate from the standard use of the word. That is, you might think that any action that involves picking up the top card of the encounter deck and turning it over and showing it to everyone is "revealing" it, because that's what the word means in ordinary usage. But for the purposes of the rules, this is not so (in game terms, the card has been "looked at" but not "revealed"), and so a card is only "revealed" if you're specifically told it has been. Discarding a card and looking at what's on it isn't "revealing" the card for the purposes of game rules.

As @Alonewolf87 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/329691-alonewolf87/] stated, they are not revealed. See the rules on Guarded (X), e.g., here: http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#the-wilds-of-rhovanion-deluxe-expansion-quest-lost-in-mirkwood [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#the-wilds-of-rhovanion-deluxe-expansion-quest-lost-in-mirkwood]

Note that the word "reveal" is nowhere above. So don't overthink it—instead, accept the gift of not having to reveal, heh.

Just to add to this, if a card is “added to the staging area” it is not revealed (sometimes they will instead say “reveal and add to the staging area”). If it is just added but not revealed, you also avoid the “when revealed” effects.

 

This can be important as some quests have you search the deck for an enemy and add it, so it can be good to choose one with a nasty “when revealed” effect.

You are right, I sometimes forget that rule and when a location indicates that an enemy needs to be added I resolve the when revealed effect.
