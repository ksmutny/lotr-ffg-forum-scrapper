 Hi,

If I attache a "song" to a hero, will the hero get the songs resourcesymbol IN ADDITION to his own symbol, or will tje heros symbol be REPLACED by the songs resourcesymbol?

Thanks in advance!

 It says the hero "gains" a resource symbol.  They do not lose any other symbols.  So their resources will be usable for both spheres.

 Thanks for the fast reply!

 I think songs would be crappy if they replaced the resource symbol. :-(

 If they did replace a resource symbol, what would you do if you stacked songs on a hero? There's no mechanic for discarding the song when another is played. Fortunately, we don't have to worry about that because they do stack. Good thing!

songs aren't restricted.. that mechanic is only when casting restricted attachments isn't it?

yes thats correct

 That sounds like that Songs are a powerful attachment, actually.

yes they are one of the key card types in the game, and an excellent addition to decks that open up a tonne of options

 I think they make Narvis Belt almost absolete.

this is a issue that has been talked about b4. The songs are strong cards, there is no doubt... but the belt is a key card for a number of decks that simply do not function as well with out it.

For example most of the ziggy fuelled decks that people have in the labs waiting for Darowdelf to start that run 2 and in some cases 1 hero decks require this card. This is a HUGE chuck of deck types. One that most players have really only started to experiment with. The validity of the 2 and 1 hero decks is yet to be seen as secrecy is yet to really kick into gear, though there is already a few extremely powerful 2 and 1 hero decks floating about.

The way I see it is that a song is a mana source. You can run a ton of songs, and this will in itself act like a resource engine. Though the Belt is normally a key card in a deck for a specific purpose as part of a combo (so far) this is the main difference i see, in utility. Many decks will run 4+ songs.. now you can run 3 belts and put other function cards in those slots..

narvi's belt isnt obsolete.....i use it as a go to card for whenever i want to add various splashes without nessecarily wanting to rely on one sphere

so one turn you could have a hero be lore to get burning brand on them, next turn they could help out another spirit hero in paying for a 5 cost card, next turn they can be tactics and so on..you dont have this flexibilty with songs, unless you want to wait to bang 3 on them

 Good point! 

The belt actually let you choose a tait whatever you want.

I have another question about Songs and adding a resources symbol.

I'm wondering what you all think about putting attachments that are sphere specific on a hero with a song attached. Burning Brand and Support of the Eagles, for instance, say you have to put them on a [Lore or Tactics] character (or hero). If I have a Song of Battle on Aragorn can he have Support of Eagles attached to him?

I'm not sure because the song cards say they "gain a Lore symbol" which doesn't seem like exactly the same thing as them being Lore character.

It´s legal!

 The presence of the Tactics icon is the ONLY thing that makes them a Tactics hero.  If they have the icon, they're in that sphere.
