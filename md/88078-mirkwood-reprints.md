# [Mirkwood Reprints](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88078-mirkwood-reprints/)

## 1 [Khamul The Easterling on August 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88078-mirkwood-reprints/?do=findComment&comment=834355)

Should I have to worry about the Mirkwood going out of stock again fairly soon since many many people have been waiting to get them?  Or will they be available for a long time now?  What do you think?

 

Thanks

Wouldn't worry too much about that. It was a long time befor they got sold out the first time. About a year or so. But if you are nervous you could either just buy all of the, as quick as possible (miniaturemarket has them for just under $10) or maybe just buy an old and a new together every time a new is released. Or just wait until AtS cycle is over and then continue to but one a month after that. I'm pretty sure it won't be sold out too quickly.

Also, I managed to find a little online store that had them at a good price about 2 month ago in Germany. And I'm from Denmark so there's always hope :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] (just NEVER go for the heartless people on ebey that charges an arm and a leg pr pack.)

I only need Marshes and Hunt.  I have been looking on Amazon but they still dont really seem to have them with a fair price yet. I never do ebay for lotr lcg.  Whats the shipping for marshes and hunt on MM? I dont have an account on there yet so I was wondering how much it would be with shipping. its $19.44  without shipping.

i know for individual APs, MM's price + shipping is less than the $14.95 retail price. you don't have to have an account to put things in your cart to get an estimate on the shipping price. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It can't be 29.16. I by them for $9.72 each. So if we say $20 for two and then it looked like it was between $6.25 and $10 in shipping depending on what kind of shipping. So you should look at a price around top $30 inclusive everything. Just checked 2 min ago :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

!!?!?!?! Dude each point is 1 cent and it takes 1 dollar to get 1 point.  So To get 1 free AP it would take $1000.  How much have you spent??

it changed at the beginning of the year - i don't remember what it used to be - it just seemed like i racked up points faster before.

In case anyone cares, the Mirkwood reprints do not have the "Easy Mode" ring.

Do you think the "difficult" encounter cards will have the gold border?

Hi.

It's http://www.planetharry.at/index2.htm [http://www.planetharry.at/index2.htm]

Great guy to deal with. First you email him about what to want and when you agree you get two options of payment with VISA. 1. Email him the card info. I didn't feel too comfortable with that. So I went for option number 2. To call him with the details. He speaks good English and was very nice.

Good luck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Even the most non-German-speaking should be able to find the ENGLISH link...like me. I don't speak/read German and it wasn't an issue.

Wasn´t meant to sound harsh.

 

Just came back from the store and it appears he got Dead Marshes and Rhosgobel left.

 

But he sometimes has some left in the back.
