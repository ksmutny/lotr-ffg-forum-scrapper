Called it! Legolas, Haldir, Mirlonde! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Not that it was hard to call.

 

They can't do math, though: they think the deck starts with 23 threat, but it's 24. I'm also disappointed there were no spoilers. Supposedly only a few days left to wait, though.

 

Anyway, I like this deck a lot better, but I don't think the resource balance leans enough toward lore. With all those 1-cost tactics cards, you could play one every rounds and I see it being very difficult to save up enough to put Rumil in play. I see this in my own decks as well, and I think this deck is even worse. I really like the Rain of Arrows + Pursuing the Enemy combo. 1 damage always feels so useless, but 2 on everyone could be pretty game changing and should allow you to only use 1 attacker per character against the enemies that survive. I was confused why they would bother with Rivendell Bow, but then I looked more closely and finally realized it isn't restricted. That's pretty cool, but it's still pretty weak at 1 resource for a conditional 1 damage. Adding ranged to a couple more allies seems like a solid option, but I like the idea of Haldir and/or Legolas being even more powerful :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].

hahahaaha I was going to post exactly this.

Its a much better deck than the first one that pairs with it but still not as good as many of the ones on the forums or even my Noldor/Silvan mixed decks. PLUS WE WANT ACTUAL GODDAMN NEWS PLEASE  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Tell us more about the first AP in Angmar Awakened or The Lost Realm OR Treason of Isenguard or even just new nightmare decks for the first half of Against the Shadow cycle!!

To be honest all those ffg strategy articles a not good. I dont even bother myself to read it most of the time…..

I sometimes like to read them because I enjoy themed decks much more than power decks. But I think that we're all dying for just any tidbit of new stuff that these articles come across as disappointing. Just one card! They could even put in in the deck list and not even mention it in the article, to see how attentive people are being! But I have hope that the wait will be worth it. I REALLY want the Rohan hero to be Erkenbrand. PLEASE just be somebody awesome.

As far as I remember, none of yet spoiled final AP cards has anything to do with Silvan. So, maybe, this is applicible to the whole pack and therefore there are nothing to put into elven decks from it.

Good point, I think this very well may be the case as all four events and allies in the two cycles (2 cost allies and 0 cost events) have come out so unless we get some random unique ally or something.

So...I just started reading these articles because I'm looking at whether or not I'd like to try the game. But is it just me, or would this be a really expensive deck to make? They list a lot of different sources for cards. How much would this deck cost? Or is that a faux pas to ask here? I'm already buying xwing stuff here and there, so I don't want to end up perpetually broke. Star Wars is my space opera fix whereas LOTR hits the fantasy.

That's a tricky question because it would cost around $200 if you dove straight into this deck from not owning anything.  But then you would also get a boatload of other cards to make many other decks and play many many quests.  So, you can't really compare the cost of a deck to a game like X-wing or Magic.  You could also swap out a few of the cards in these decks to reduce the number of expansions you need.  You could probably make comparable decks with just the core set, Voice of Isengard, and Ringmaker Cycle.  Although that is still going to be $100+.

 

Either way, if you are thinking about getting into the game, I wouldn't recommend starting off trying to make a deck like this.  Start with the core set, then probably the mirkwood cycle.

The blog Tales from the Cards has some excellent buyers guides that you could check out as well before purchasing.

Yeah it is a good point :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

 I would still like a unique Spirit Silvan ally - one that would also be worth including in a Caldara deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Spoilers that I'm aware of:

Hero: Rohan, Leadership

Allies: Tree beard & Booming Ent

Attachment: Captain of Gondor

Event: unnamed Rohan trample one 

(and a promise to make Rohan & mounts/charging etc awesome)

 

Have I missed any?

 

I would happily see more Ents allies (one for spirit and one for leadership even), haven't played enough Rohan to know what I wish they had.

 

I WANT MORE SPOILERS!!

There won't be any more ent allies, sadly. In the spoiler for The Antlered Crown, it said this when talking about the Booming Ent:

 



> Because you’ll be able to command as many as seven Ent allies once The Antlered Crown releases, it’s entirely possible to get this two-cost character up to a massive Attack Strength of nine.

 

7 Ents = 3x Wandering Ent, 3x Booming Ent, 1x Treebeard.

 



> (and a promise to make Rohan & mounts/charging etc awesome)

What are you referring to? I don't remember that promise in relation to The Antlered Crown.

There is certain amount of assumption from the news article "you’ll find allies and events that further depict the ability of Rohan’s finest warriors to charge headlong into battle" plus some of the implied comments regarding mounts and there future awesomeness from Team Covenant's "Celebrimbor's Secret" boxing interview... (which could be further down the track... but that would be cruel!)

If we are indeed getting Leadership Erkenbrand, hopefully we'll get some other Leadership cards to go with him, some Rohan warriors mayb, "Edoras Bodyguard" or maybe an attachment, so that Leadership rohan becomes a thing. The thing is, the hero itself should be pretty good, since he'll most of the times have to replace Imrahil.

Because we are pretty sure who the heroes will be in The Treason of Isengard, I'm pretty sure it will be Erkenbrand.

## 20 [chuckles on December 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129300-the-woodland-realms-unite-part-two/?do=findComment&comment=1371640)

Yeah the hero really will need to be good to avoid becoming a coaster!! 

 

Leadership Erkenbrand plus some riders would be cool.

 

More combat originated Rohan allies in general would be great... i'm hoping that the abundance of combat ready allies relate to Rohan (if there isn't any more Silvan allies)... Silvan didn't get much in the way of leadership allies but it was more than enough, plus Celeborn, to make them useful!  Hopefully so too 'Erkenbrand/new hero' for Rohan.

You're right. This whole paragraph throws hints out at you, but uses a language that may be more abstract and not actually mean a whole lot for the cards:

 

> Naturally, The Antlered Crown delivers heroics and combat-ready allies in abundance; you’ll find allies and events that further depict the ability of Rohan’s finest warriors to charge headlong into battle, as well as a handful of cards that wrap up the cycle’s introduction of the Ent trait to The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game.



"combat-ready allies" may mean a slightly different theme for Rohan than before because it sounds like we may have some guys that want to stay and fight, but it should suit chuckles' wish for more "combat [oriented] Rohan allies". The use of the word "charge", may or may not actually mean they'll have more mechanics that represent a charge... it could just be talking about guys that don't shy from combat, but with Charge of the Rohirrim released in Celebrimbor's Secret, I wouldn't be surprised to see more awesome charge-related mechanics.

 

I'm sad that it only mentions "allies and events", so we don't know for sure that we'll get more mounts, but I still expect one, hopefully Leadership so we have on in every sphere.

Hmm... leadership mounts would work for me... but what type of ability? A defensive bonus would be cool.

I find it strange how little appreciative the people on this board are to the Second Breakfast articles. I think the two decks together are actually very good considering how thematic they stay. I find them much better in that way that the vast majority of decks I have seen here posted from veteran players.

I would just concentrate more allies with Celeborn and Galadriel (all copies of Minstrel and Tree People) and attachments with Haldir (together with Master of the Forge to bring them in). 

 

The view is not very informative though, and the "appreciation" not representative, as the population of the boards have dwindled into handful of regulars. Which is something I actually think is FFG's fault, providing the community with far fewer preview articles (and spoilers) than before.

## 24 [lleimmoen on December 19, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129300-the-woodland-realms-unite-part-two/?do=findComment&comment=1372026)

"you’ll find allies and events that further depict the ability of Rohan’s finest warriors to charge headlong into battle"

 

The quote most likely refers to the event Ride Them Down, partly spoiled in the preview article, which will probably allow you to hit a non-unique enemy in the staging with direct damage. As for the allies, expect a Leadership defender, and Erkebrand as another Rohan Leadership defender, though a hero.
