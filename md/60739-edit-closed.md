If there are FFG mods perusing the site, this would be a great post to sticky. Essential stuff that will answer 90% of common rules questions.

Huh, I didn't realize there was a time limit on post edits. Never encountered that problem, not that I've ever tried to change an older submission.

Even so, I think most of the links will still work fine. Most of them just redirect to home pages that are unlikely to move in the near future. The one you mentioned is actually to the LotR mini-site, not directly to the FAQ itself. Presumably, that URL will remain the same as FFG updates the mini-site, so that shouldn't be a problem. Perhaps the BGG link might become obsolete, though. 

If you are correct about post editing, the main problem will be an inability to add new resources. Still, I think these are valuable enough to warrant some kind of preservation.
