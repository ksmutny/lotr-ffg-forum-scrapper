Should this card be unique?  Are their other examples of 'named' allies that are not unique?

She is not a ´named´ character…..

She has a name like our old friend the Erebor Recordkeeper.

Yes, I think it's the rule with allies, once they have a name, they're unique. If not then not. It sometimes leads to funny card names like Daughter of the Nimrodel.
