So i read FAQ and there was conflict about these things.

 

(1.00) The Golden Rule 
The Golden Rule reads: “If the game text of a card 
contradicts the text of the rulebook, the text on the card 
takes precedence.” 
The Golden Rule applies when there is a direct 
contradiction between card text and rules text. If it is 
possible to observe both card text and the text of the 
rulebook, both are observed.
Example: The rulebook (p. 15) reads: “Any progress 
tokens that would be placed on a quest card are instead 
placed on the active location.” Legolas (CORE 5) has 
an effect that reads, “...place 2 progress tokens on the 
current quest.” Legolas’ effect would place 2 progress 
tokens on the quest; the core rule from page 15 instead 
places those tokens on the active location. Thus, the 
Legolas ability can successfully resolve, and the core 
rule can be observed, without creating a golden rule 
situation. 
 
Q: Does the effect on Legolas (CORE 5) place progress 
tokens on an active location, if there is one? 
A: Yes. Always place progress tokens on an active 
location instead of the quest, unless the ability 
specifically states to bypass any active location.
 
So what is rigth answer can legolas place progress tokens on active location or not?

Hmmmm, as a follow up question now that I think of it:

If the location says "immune to player card effects" do they go on the quest instead?

My guess is no, and they are lost...but does anyone know for certain?

Yes, Legolas's effect places progress tokens on the active location before the current quest.  If that location is "Immune to card effects" the progress tokens are simply lost.

Pretty good question. I agree with the 2 above me that the travel tokens are placed on the active location. Here are a couple topics(1 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/81443-quest-and-location-same-thing-for-legolas-and-lorien-guide/?hl=legolas] 2 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/70433-legolas/?hl=legolas]) about the same question.

@Grandspleen: yeah I kind of figured, just wanted to make sure. Thanks!

@dwarfkingbronzebeard: you should give legolas some game time indeed! He's awesome.

I really enjoy playing him. He's a schoolbook example of a well designed hero from the start.
