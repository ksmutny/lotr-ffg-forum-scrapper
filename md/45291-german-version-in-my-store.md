It arrived today - but they are still waiting for an English version, which I will wait for. I am really looking forward to ts arrival and Deutsch is my second language, but this is Tolkien and "Kankra" doesnt do it for me like "Shelob" does, even though it is a pretty creepy word.

Don't just stand there, get one and see how many Player cards come one to a core deck! I need to know how many one copy cards there are in each sphere! For the math!

Yes, that would be a great idea. And you'd be a temporary celebrity!

The only reason I said alas, is just because there is not one in a store I can buy today.  But that's okay, envy is a sin.

Tthe german version is about 10-15€ cheaper (english.v: 40€, german 25€ @ amazon.de) so I ordered german. I also found on the homepage of the german publisher, Heidelberger Spieleverlag, that they plan on selling every chapter pack for 10€ instead of the 15€ the english would cost. I'd love to have it in english, but I with that big price difference they leave me no choice...
