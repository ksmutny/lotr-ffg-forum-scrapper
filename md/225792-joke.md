What is the greatest evidence one of the game designers was a Targaryen fan during Against the Shadow?

Outlanders?

## 3 [Calvadur on July 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2326433)

Fire & Blood being Targaryen's "Motto" I assume the release of BLOOD of Numenor and Gondorian FIRE.

## 4 [Gizlivadi on July 25, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2326442)

Beat me to it, was going to post the exact same thing.

That's not a joke.

This thread is a joke.

Maybe "they" just want you to think it´s a joke...

Confirmed?

@John - The color of that picture uses the same green pantone as a portion of the Arkham Horror LCG photo that JsBingley posted back in may.   Confirmed!

Yep.

The enemy The Hand of Castamir card in LOTR.

An agenda card called The Rains of Castamere in AGOT.

## 12 [Gizlivadi on July 26, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2328220)

Lol, if anything that shows Tolkien's influence on Martin, not the opposite.

## 13 [Bullroarer Took on July 26, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2328245)

Oh for sure.

## 14 [Gizlivadi on July 26, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2328283)

You are aware Castamir of Umbar is a character from Tolkien, right? Just making sure.

## 15 [Bullroarer Took on July 26, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2328402)

Yes.

## 16 [Nerdmeister on July 27, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2329170)

There are six major houses of GoT: Stark, Lannister, Martell, Greyjoy, Tyrell and Baratheon

 

LotR is intended for 2 players each playing 3 characters giving 6 characters in all... just like the number of houses from GoT

Also 6 is a number thus proving beyond doubt that the two franchises are intertwined in a FFG-web we cannot begin to fathom

But 6 is the square root of 36 and 6+36=42, the ultimate answer to everything! Coincidence?!

My god now it makes sense.

A guy named Toenail threatens suicide... if you convert that name into numbers and ad the consonants together you get 46, leaving just the 4 vowels: 46-4 = 42.... we have it again

A guy named Toenail threatens suicide. There is a boss named Nine Toes in a game called Borderlands. There is eleven letters in Borderlands. 9/11. Illuminati confirmed.

The picture didn't load up. Happens a lot to me.

## 25 [Authraw on August 1, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2336664)

It's been like that for a while now.

## 26 [Gizlivadi on August 1, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2336936)

I can't even remember the last time I saw the actual image. Is it the FFG logo?

## 27 [Slothgodfather on August 1, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225792-joke/?do=findComment&comment=2337044)

I'm using a different "theme" I guess because the site has a light grey/white background, but the logo loads just fine for me.

Yeah normally this shows up for me but now that I have checked it has also disappeared for me.
