Running though are 1st game now of a freshly open box... and found a weird thing.... the Passage of Mirkwood scenario has to different cards marked 3A... they are both called "a chosen path" but they have a different text on the 3B part of the card.... one of the 3B's has a win condition on it.... is this a type and it is meant to be 4a/b ? So mirkwood is a 4 card scenario?

What should i do with this extra card?

 If you check 2b for Mirkwood, you'll discover that once you reach a Fork in the Road, you randomly choose between the two 3a/b cards to see which path you take - so you never quite know what your victory condition is until you reach the final challenge.

Cheers,
