Had a great gaming session earlier today, but the question of how this quest works came up.

 

The text reads:

 

>  
> 
>  
> 
> X is the threat of the player with the highest threat. 

With X being the quest points.

 

Does this stay static at the point the card is revealed, or constantly recalculate?

 

We played it as the latter and it made it quite a long and involving questing stage!

 

 

Thanks in advance!

I see it as a moving number as well.  Similar to how your fellowship allies always change control with the first player.   I don't see any reason why it would be a static number.

X's in the game always recalculate.  X would only be constant if it said something like "When Revealed: Set X equal to the threat of the player with the highest threat" but I don't think I've ever seen wording like that.

Thanks for the replies. 

 

We assumed this would be the case, but I wanted to check in on... Need to get some treat reduction prioritised (or play alongside a Secrecy deck!).
