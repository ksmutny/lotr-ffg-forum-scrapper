Full spoilers on cardgame db which FFG purchased apparently. Pretty awesome of them to put them up the second its out so I can see them before my two week wait over here in Australia =)

Just looked at each enouncter and quest card as well as the two encounter sets used from Voice of Isengard and the quest looks pretty hard! Looks fun and very unique, the last stage especially and its win condition as well!

From first scrutiny it looks like FFG have done a really really good job with this quest, can't wait to get my hands on it and hopefully get proven correct!

Yes this one looks really difficult and i love it! Sounds like this quest give you some new cool options and looks amazing in 3 4 players game.

I think, this quest is "either defeat all enemies before advancing to the second stage or lose".

First, the leaked spoilers from so long ago that were found on Beorn's site were only partially correct.  Some changes have been made.

 

Second, While I understand the idea of resetting the player's board so that it's not so easy to steamroll through stages 2 & 3, this might be a bit too extreme.  A lot of decks will simply flat out fail here.  This is without playing it though, there could be some subtleties I am missing.

 

Third... My pack is in.  I'll be playing it tonight.  Woot!

I already played this quest a couple times and it is definitely very difficult. You want to play all your cards because the time counter is only 2 and makes you discard your hand, but you do not want to play all your allies and attachments because the second quest card destroys all of those. Lots of strategy has to go into this when you play, and timing is everything. I only won once but it was very close. This is going to be a quest that sees a lot of play throughs. Hope you all enjoy it soon!

Won my first time through. Did I get lucky? Maybe. We've been waiting so long that I read all the spoilers and had a really good idea of what end quest was doing when so it wasn't like a blind play through at all. And I was playing a deck that was tuned to handle Isengard and the Dunlanders. So I was able to make my own luck by knowing which cards were important and which weren't. Note that I didn't change a single card in my deck, I just knew what was important. If I were to tune my deck going forward I would hope for more success.

Some simple solutions to own this quest....

 

Hammersmith / fat gross hobbit eating leadership event

Hold till you discard your attachments. As with all effects that trigger at the same time you choose the order, so place attachments in order.. Cast your attachment retrival.. and bang you back in power. 

 

Use Calandra for mass ally recursion. 

 

Stand and Fight - Ally recursion

Wholeheartedly agree on the location art; it's gorgeous.  The Old South Road is the most evocative road art yet, in my opinion.  I love it.

 

For more on the lore of these locations and the Dunlending enemies, please check out my latest post at Master of Lore about The Dunland Trap encounter cards [http://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/06/28/the-dunland-trap-encounter-cards/].

Played the quest 3 times now, twice single player once two player and have lost each time.  It is quite tricky and I do appreciate the unique challenges of the quest stages.   

## 20 [Gizlivadi on June 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109452-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1136626)

This was an extremely good article, Kerstoid. As I've stated before, Dunland and the Dunlendings is one of my favorte factions in Middle Earth and possibly my favorite of the enemy ones. I certainly agree that a 21st century perspective can offer interesting possibilities regarding Dunland. They have an interesting culture and lots of room for creativity and for the mind to "wander freely". Something that I would also have mentioned that, as MECCG did in the past, they have given the Dunlendings a fairly "Pictish [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picts]" visual style, albeit a bit more primitive. The Boar and Raven clans, guardian spirits and Standing Stone cirlces as we'll see in the Three Trials point to an explicit celtic inspiration for the Dunlendings, which I absolutely love. I also expect FFG to develop the dunlending's morality, as you said, in a more mature and sympathetic way so they're portrayed as more than mere "wild people". Also hopefully we will see the Dunlending's dwellings, their duns [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dun], from which I think Dunland takes its name. In fact, seeing as the Dunland Trap ends in sort of a cliffhanger and that we start the Three Trials under the protection of the Raven clan, I speculate that at the end of this first adventure we will be rescued by a Raven clan ambush on our assailants, and as payment for their help we will accept these "three trials" to recover the crown.

 

So as I said, I have great expectations for Dunland in this cycle. My only hope is that it won't fall into the cliched, tired "who's the savage" storyline a la Pocahontas or Avatar.

Lost again solo, need to tweak it more but my silvan combination of Celeborn, Elrond, and Glorfindel may not be the ideal matchup for this quest.  Needs a bit of setup and with this quest you really need to be good to go from the onset.  Pleased with the challenge thus far.  This past time I made it all the way to the end but lost when all the engaged enemies attack a second time after the last time counter is removed.  Just didnt have an answer for a second assault from Chief Turch

Thank you, Master of Lore, for an amazing article.

 

Gizlivadi, stage 1A of The Three Trials (from the preview) reads: "At the edge of a cursed forest, the Boar Shaman explains that you must undertake three trials in order to recover the Antlered Crown, or face death." So I expect we're now either prisoners or semi-allies of the Boar Clan. If the Boar Clan controls the Antlered Crown after this scenario, that might explain why war has broken out in Dunland by the sixth adventure pack. Perhaps the Raven clan, who we're fighting in that scenario, is trying to claim the Antlered Crown from the Boar Clan. As Master of Lore points out, perhaps we end up inadvertently uniting the Dunlendings under Sauruman's influence.

Ah you're right Estel Edain. It was the Boar clan who gives us this mission. I guess that we're taken as prisoners by Chief Turch after the Trap.

> Take Tactics Boromir.

 

I thought of using him as well, equipped with a gondorian shield and maybe even a juiced gondorian fire he would do wonders against this quest.  Just finished up a 2 player attempt where we finally won.  Gave my friend the silvan deck and I used a mono tactics deck of Eomer, Beregond, and Legolas (thought about using Boromir instead of Eomer but I really wanted to try out Firefoot)

To those that have played the quest a few times now, I have a question on Chief Turch. When he appears and is engaged

with the first player does that take one of the time counters off and does he become engaged with the first player on each turn or just as he's revealed?

he engages - so you remove one token due to the end of round, and one because of his engaging the new first player.

ok thank you, thats what I figured but wasnt sure just because i normally figure if theres a rule that could go either way it normally makes it harder for the player ha

Enjoyed learning more about the Picts and duns, thanks!  I agree that a simple, they're actually good and we're actually bad twist wouldn't be satisfying.  I rather hope that learn more about FFG's interpretation of their culture (what are the keys? what is the Antlered Crown?) and understand why they fight as they do, both against us and (apparently) against each other.

 

As I haven't received my pack yet, I'm still speculating about the narrative text following the scenario.  If anyone wants to spoil what happens with Chief Turch's Boar Clan and our heroes after defeating the scenario, I'd welcome the change to find out!

It does seem that if we're taking sides in this Dunlending war, we're going with the Boar Clan against the Raven Clan.  I'm looking forward to understanding why.  Is the Antlered Crown somehow the rightful artifact of their tribe?

 

On a gameplay note, has anyone had success with a Celeborn / Silvan deck yet or does it still need more cards (or a different scenario) to function?

Yes, but if you are playing solo the second one doesn't happen.

When playing solo, First and Last Player commands target you. Only Next Player fails to resolve.

I know that. So if I'm always the first player then he doesn't re-engage me and an additional token isn't removed.

Seriously just had the most insane/improbable victory on this quest ever.  Was play 4 player, we were outclassed by the quest essentially by turn two and should have just scooped but kept on chugging, barely made it to the last stage all heroes were 1 damage away from death. so we're at the last stage that has 16 time tokens remaining on it. 3 copies of dunlending ambush appear and we pass the current location so 12 enemies total engage the players, one of our two tactics players use the hammer stroke which causes all enemies to engage him dropping our time tokens to well below zero with Chief Turch's effect then our other tactics player uses thicket of spears so none of them attack for the phase securing our victory.  Not 100% sure on the ruling between the effect on stage 3 and how that works with thicket but it was probably the most rewarding game i've played in quite some time

No... for the 3rd time... You are BOTH the 1st and Last player at the same time.. ALL the time.. you are both. If anything targets 1st or last.. it targets you.

Boored : what Bullroarer Took is asking is wether the first player token is lost and regain when playing solo.

If you have to say something three times, maybe you should ask yourself why the other person insist.

sigh.. Lets try this a 4th time....

YES IT IS LOST AND REGAINED. You are both the first and last player at the same time. So imagine you are two players. You are first and last. When the turn ended you pass the 1st player token AND receive it.

Wow... wait a second, you are saying, when playing solo, you lost the status of first player then regain it, wich in this case, (Chief Turch) will proc another instance of engaging you ? (so Lore Pippin, Sam, Quest effect, and all that...) Because there was not any first player, he was not engage with you, and when regaining it, it will engage you anew.

 

I think not, and I will even go as to assume this is not what you wanted to say.

I know you mean good because you take time to reply and try to explain a lot of thing to some newer people here and you they sometimes don't express what they want clearly. Try to understand what they say when they obviously fail to see your point.

 

If you really meant it, then ignore previous paragraph. Just go with : How did you manage to affirm this ? The rules say to pass it to the NEXT, wich, as you said three times, doesn't exist, so you shouldn't passes it.

Ok...

 

 

...

 

 

so...

 

 

please care to be more accurate on what you refere to as "This" in your last post ?

I'm quite lost and don't know if you are standing on your ground that "the first player is lost and regain" without any logical explanation and after I point out the rules say the opposite ?

Rules says (Refresh phase): "...and the first player passes the first player token to the next player clockwise on his left."

And FAQ: (1.46) “Next” player. If there is only one player in the game, there is no next player.

 

So in solo games you can't pass (and receive) the 1st player token yourself.

In solo, you always are the first and last player since the beginning of the game, but there is no trigger to engages the 1st player once already engaged.

That is the most retarded ruling I have seen in this game for a while. People just love making the game easy and forcing it to not have effects resolve as they haven't the skill to play correctly. You guys can make it the game retarded if you like.. but this ruling is wrong and for fools. It makes NO thematic sense in any way for cards that trigger on the change of the player token to not hit a solo player.

The funniest thing is that the ruling makes this particular stage harder not easier as less time counters are removed each turn which means you have to survive longer against their trap before winning.

Now that most of us have overcome the Chief Turch issue let's talk about the quest I general. As a solo player I feel there is a formula to it, but that's not too unusual really. The thing that worries me is that the quest is SO complex that it earned a Player's Tip to play slow and make sure you check all the triggers. Is this a trend we need to be worried about?

Simple and hard versus complex and easier?

The game has always had many moving parts. Whoops I forgot that at the moment it is +attack or oh all locations had +threat or w/e. This is why everyone plays wrong all the . Trust me if you think you played a perfect game, you probably didn't. This is even more so for solo players as they have no one to check. The quests will only get more complex as time hose by, not less

Wow it really does look like you are a captive (or have come to an understanding) with Chief Turch/the boar clan in general as the text on the first stage of The Three Trials reads: "At the edge of a cursed forest, the Boar Shaman explains that you must undertake three trials in order to recover the antlered crown, or face death. Each trial will test your worthiness. Guardian spirits watch over three sacred swords, protecting them from the undeserving."

We might also see these three swords mentioned in some way or another (they may even just be the keys in this quest) as well as the antlered crown itself.

 

Also just realised that in the art for "The Guardian's Fury" which is top right in the image I posted; it looks like a wolf skin on that guardian's head. Pretty sure this means the three guardians are gonna be Raven, Boar and Wolf.

Yup, this is exactly what I think as well Psychorocka. It seems that Raven, Boar and Wolf are going to be the spirit guardians as well as the three conflicting clans of the Dunlendings. The swords are going to be the key objectives as well, that somehow unlock the Antlered Crown itself. I think this is a pretty interesting story and it is clear that the design team has decided to give Dunland a much deeper and detailed culture, which I think is amazing. I like how they have kept the mystery about the Crown itself. What is it really? My guess is that it's a magical artifact capable of uniting the clans, sort of like a powerful authority symbol that all clans must bow to, and to the one who bears it. Can't wait to see where this cycle goes!

The quest is pretty cool. There are plenty of forced effect to keep track of, but I don't find it any more complex as some others. The more complex quests like this usually see less repeated plays because when I want to have a quick causal game that I like to test new decks on i'll choose something else. There is definitely a formula that has to be figured out to win. Alot of the formula comes down to the transition between stages in this one. Once you know what these transitions are you build a deck accordingly. The transitions between quest cards in this scenario are quite dramatic, and are going to effect your early choices, and the 1st stage messes with a turtle strategy, since you are having to discard your hand every couple turns, but if you speed things up and blast into the 2nd stage you might be unprepared for what you face, and stage 2 intentionally messes up any early preparations any way. All this creates a tense balance of how to proceed.

I decided after losing with eomer/eowyn/imrahil twice to go with my other deck that came out of VoI Grima/ Aragorn/Mirlonde Kamikaze draw deck, and to my surprise it's won 2 out of 3. It's quite funny to play, since my opening strategy is to select the Boar enemy that gets a shadow card when cards are drawn, so before the first quest phase I'll draw like crazy until i get song of kings, Gandalf, and sneak attack, drop a ranger spikes into the staging area while I'm at it and then sneak Gandalf in for quest phase and deal 4 damage to the guy and remove a heap of shadow cards. It's actually not to hard to do with this deck. This deck can get to the 2nd stage pretty easily and does not suffer from the transition all that bad, it actually benefits a bit since my discard pile gets reshuffled into my deck. Dealing with the bear clan chief relies on some chump blockers, and Gandalf a bunch of times. Playing Gandalf for full cost in the last round when the last time counter is removed is a good strategy, since he can defend the chief in combat, then Gandalf will ready in refresh, time counter will be removed, chief attacks again, and Gandalf defends again for the win. I guess the chief never hast to be attacked and defeated to win, not to hard to do, but would add a bit more to the win condition other then just having to defend with all your heroes remaining.

I kind of stalled out there for awhile, was mostly making decks with spoiled cards, but I'm working on a new deck mostly designed for dunland trap, but probably will be good on other quests too. The heroes for the deck are Eowyn, Eomer, and Beregond. Eomer, in my opinion has become the best attacker in the game. With one Rohan Warhorse and Firefoot he can do some serious damage. Firefoot puts him at 5 attack, which is great, because then he does not need to rely on allies leaving play regularly, when I need to bump him up to 7 I'll use spirit bofur. Pairing him up with the best defender and quester in the game makes for an interesting deck that can handle most things without relying on a ton of allies.

I was almost going to hold off building decks until I had the whole cycle in hand, since I find it kind of pointless to build a silvan deck with Celeborn right now when we are only scratching the surface of silvan synergy. Secrecy, is also intriguing, but i don't necessarly see how it would help on a quest like Dunland Trap. It's probably the worst quest to try it out on since an enemy is engaged in set up, and turtle strategy seems to suffer. I would love to get all player cards right away, but Then it would be very clear which cards were headed to the box, at least I might try some of the cards that seem a bit lack luster and may even find a use for a card that I thought was worthless, so I guess I'm okay with it. Also scenarios that are earlier in the cycle become easier with all the player cards for the cycle, so I did not want to miss out on that challenge.

Tracker - you've mentioned twice that you can't durdle on this quest, but I beg to differ.  It is true that you will probably be throwing away a lot of cards every other turn, but if you are digging for specific cards that can really help you.  Remember that the quest lets you draw a lot of cards too.  Here's my example:  I took my super-hero attachment deck and added a bunch of non-item attachments, especially Dunedain Warning.  To play these I need some Songs so I added extra copies of those.  It's important when using this strategy to really lower the cost of the cards in your deck so that you can play these cards when you draw them and not keep pitching them away of course, but the Songs and Warnings cost 1.  After drawing all of my attachments, and hopefully a Warden of Healing I'm ready to progress to the end step with out much to fear.

 

I'm 4 & 1 with this strategy and the one loss was really bad luck.  Even poor drawing is pretty much a win.

Your absolutly right, after playing a few decks against it, i've found the card draw the scenario provides let's you dig for those cards you need. I dont even have any card draw in my deck since the scenario is so generous. It makes a lot more sense to go with a non item attachment deck then trying to build up an ally army. Once all this is figured out it's pretty simple. Funny thing is that i took some of these deck that work for this scenario against some easier scenarios and they really struggle. That's why this is not a good scenario to test new decks on, since so many of the normal mechanics are altered. It does make for a good challenge though.

I have a feeling that this quest really opens up in multi-player.  It seems like we are saying that a lot lately and I might have to bite the bullet and build a pair of complimentary decks and try things that way.  I think I've been reluctant to do so because I tried that in the early days and things got so easy that it really put me off.  And second, there is already so much going on that trying to play two handed will lead to more mistakes for sure.

 

Oh well... I just got my Khazad-Dum Nightmare pack so I'll try that first.

As someone who generally plays two-handed solo I can honestly say that some of the recent quests are not easier because of the encounter decks ability to string surges and combine effects against the player. 

 

One thing I would like to ask for some people who have played the Dunland Trap quest (SPOILER ALERT): Do you ever see the lose condition of 1 hero dying as kind of random? For instance, I played a game where I pretty much crushed the encounter deck and had a handle on it throughout the entire game - only to go back and realize I actually lost because Chief Turch got one of those dunland beserker shadowcards that allows for an additional attack (and then he got +1 attack in a new shadow card and that took out my Glorfindel).  How do other people feel about the "lose 1 hero, lose the game" approach? 

 

In general, I like the difficulty of this quest but that particular part (where you lose all but one ally) can make it pretty impossible depending on the encounter cards that come out (especially if some of your heroes are already exhausted from questing. Besides Frodo/Beorn absorbing damage is there any way people have found to combat this?

I get laughed at for trying to play this way, but to me the whole "chump blocker" and playing for score don't feel very Tolkien at all. So I design my decks and play style so that I can beat the quest (or at least try to) without losing anybody. In the game I played yesterday the only time I lost allies were at 2A and I can easily rationalize that as those allies escaping from the trap because the heroes stayed back to cover them. (This style can make for some long games however and it also limits the card pool.) So I don't have a problem with lose a hero lose the game.

I like the different win condition, all heroes having to survive the last stage is something we have not seen yet, and it make the story seem more realistic. There are plenty of other scenarios I have won with only 1 or 2 heroes left, sure I won but if I were continuing on a real adventure those heroes had been lost. When you play and you don't care if your heroes make it or not, it's more about winning and a bit less about the theme of the game, or something like that.

Anyway, for soloOne-hand I've played a few decks on this scenario, but there are 2 decks that I'm having fun with. that are nearly identical except for a hero change and a few different cards. I have eomer, eowyn , and either Beregond or Eleanor. In either case Eleanor and Beregond become super defenders. I'll put as many copies of UC on them as I can draw, Miruvor comes in handy to, and so does Behind Strong Walls. I also have a few copies of Gondorian discipline and Close Call, in case damage sneaks through. The key card is Blood of Gondor and letting resources pile up on the hero, because when the Gondorian shield is lost in stage 2 you want to make sure you have at least 2 UC, BoG, and at least 5+ resources to spare, especially if your playing with Eleanor. I plan on facing at least 2 -3 attacks in the final stage each round, until time is up, when time is up at end of the resource phase UC and hero refreshes before the final attacks so the hero can defend again.

In 2 player mode I think I would try to turn Beregond into a super defender and load both decks with readying effects that allow him to defend the entire board if possible as sentinel. In 2 player I would probably include cards that negate attacks, and can imagine thicket of spears being quite useful if your lucky to have it in had at the end of the game.

I find the treachery condition cards that deal damage to be the toughest to deal with, they can turn a smooth ride into a loss quickly. Since I have been playing Spirit Tactics I've found the Power of Orthanc to be key on this quest, early on in my first few decks I was even Including The Seeing Stone to fetch it if I was in trouble. I also discovered a good use for The seeing Stone and Close Call on shadow cards that chain into a number of +x attack. It's pretty nifty to take advantage of the action window before damage is calculated and use The Seeing Stone to fetch Close Call and then turn the excess damage into threat, it saved a hero a few times. Cool trick, but I have abandoned the strategy in the deck since it took up to much deck space.

Anyway it is cool scenario, but the decks I designed for this are pretty pitiful on some of the older scenarios I like to play, since I have put les emphasis on allies in the deck, I'm even playing cards like Favor of the Lady to give Eowyn just a bit more willpower. The scenario does not take a ton of willpower to be successful. Defending multiple attacks and dealing with damage is the challenge.

One last note, as I said before, Eomer, Firefoot and Rohan Warhorse is a force to be reckoned, and with if an ally leaves play he'll clear 2 - 3 beefy Dunlandings a round. Pretty cool really to bad this only lasts for stage 1.

Thanks Tracker, I will try some of those suggestions. I only have 1 core set so unfortunately I cannot "put as many UC on them as possible" but I do try to utilize Miruvor, Cram, and other readying affects as well. And perhaps I made an ambiguous statement with my earlier comment. I do actually like the win and lose condition (from a thematic point especially).  What I meant with random was the idea that without as many allies and with being stripped of many items, it can make it hard depending on certain conditions which attach to locations or treacheries that require each player to look for a dunland enemy, etc. - and then on top of that putting the Chief into play (followed by 'enemy makes additional' attacks). I suppose that is what makes it challenging and trying to combat that is the fun part. It just stinks sometimes having the game "handled", and then the game ends really shortly after 3A even when you still have a pretty good hand or game going.

The more I play this quest the more I like it. It can be a real nail biter in the last stage. With a few enemies engaged, and trying to do everything to defend the attacks. Attacking back becomes less the priority, it's all about how to survive the onslaught. Most games when I win I often don't feel feel like It was a triumphant victory. I might still have three Dunlandings facing me, and I'm wondering how I would deal with them next round. It's a very well laid Trap, and this is exactly what the designers intended, and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing the feel of being on the edge of defeat. Love it! and it fit in perfectly with the story line, they nailed it. In my opinion they perfectly matched, theme, storyline, and game play mechanics in this one.

In a few of my post earlier, I was saying it's not a great deck tester. We'll that's coming from the perspective of trying to create one deck to rule them all. Interesting thing is that some of my rule them all decks do not do so well on this quest, and the decks I tailor to this quest do not do so well on other scenarios. I like this, and I hope more scenarios will have this type of unique feel to them, as much as it can be a pain building or altering decks for specific scenarios, I do enjoy how it lets me search for solutions in the pool of cards I seldom use. I'd rather use most if not all of all the player cards I have, rather than paying hundreds of dollars and only using a 50 cards that can beat all scenarios.

I hope future scenarios continue down this road. Two thumbs up!

I don't actually have the quest yet, but plan to use Elrohir with Steward, Dunedain Warning and (hopefully!) Gondorian Shield attached, Arwen buffing him and his natural ability to block as many attacks as possible.

Focusing on non-item attachments (titles rule!) and one or two key allies and then just hoping for good draws on stage 3 where your items, mounts and allies are safe seems to be the key with this quest.

For instance, I played a game where I pretty much crushed the encounter deck and had a handle on it throughout the entire game - only to go back and realize I actually lost because Chief Turch got one of those dunland beserker shadowcards that allows for an additional attack (and then he got +1 attack in a new shadow card and that took out my Glorfindel).  How do other people feel about the "lose 1 hero, lose the game" approach?

Get to keep two when playing two handed =) Hoping for Arwen and Treebeard.......

Multiple uses out of Treebeard plus he can help play other Ents in stage 3!

I have played this. My first time. I have played it without seeing any encounter card spoiler...

 

It was funny because i felt into the trap! aaaaagh lol. I had to discard 8 allies from play (when i past to 2a). Omg! I didnt know it. Pffffffffff.... :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png] .

I had a very powerful army in play, and my hand was empty. But... into the trap... i was alone!!!

Still waiting for The Dunland Trap. Can't wait to build around Celeborn. It's estimated to arrive this week, starting today. The agony!

I suggest to you start to play it without knowing the text of the encounter cards. You will get a very 'funny' surprise. ^^ Glups! And no read my last post.... :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

Thanks for the heads up - sorry to say, I've already had some of it spoiled. Will run Cubicle7's The One Ring RPG with some friends this coming week and try to forget the card specifics!

IF YOU DONT HAVE DUNLAND TRAP YET AND DON'T TO READ SPOILERS OR DETAILED INFO/OPINIONS ABOUT THE QUEST DO NOT READ THIS POST!!!!!

Finally got my hands on Dunland Trap yesterday and had a few plays. Lost my first attempt and won on the second try. Got pretty lucky on the second go though and didn't have nearly as bad encounter draws. I breezed through the first stage on my first attempt however but spent quite a while on stage 1 the second attempt. On the second try the only two enemies I had to defend against when the last time counter was removed on stage 3 was Chief Turch and a Boar Clan Warrior. Easily defended both and had about triple the attack power needed to kill them both, captured my ass!!!!!! I guess the theme and feel of the last stage is that you are utterly surrounded though and the enemies in play/engaged are simply those rushing in to actually attack you so even if the board is clear you are still surrounded by their horde.

It works well building up your strength (has to be non-item attachments however and minimal allies as most will be discarded) on stage 1 before progressing through to stage 2 and the trap so that you are ready as stage 2 becomes stage 3 right after combat and then the struggle for survival truly begins. As much as stage 1 really pushes you to rush I find taking it slow is far better as the worst part about the discard your hand effect is how many draw triggers it sets off when it makes you redraw 2 new cards right before the resource phase in which you draw again (obviously these draw triggers are only worse than the discarding itself if there are encounter cards in play that trigger effects off card draw).

I found the following encounter cards especially nasty and the worst cards to see revealed during staging: 

-Hills of Dunland: if you can't get this out of the staging area you're in for a world of hurt as it constantly brings enemies out and may even do so just when you travel there, also sets off all other draw effects making boar clan enemies nastier.

-In Need of Rest: this pretty much killed any chance I had my first attempt, diabolical on the last stage and can pretty much kill a hero on full health in a round if enough enemies engage players and enough time counters are removed..

-Hithlaeglir Foothills: The threat of this location skyrockets if you have draw effects occuring, even if not it gains 2 threat a turn just from drawing during the resource phase, very nasty... also has surge.... (because it can potentially have 0 threat the whole first turn it is revealed so long as no one draws cards for any reason)

-Wild Men of Dunland: Just like in need of rest this can be scarily powerful especially if there are multiple draw triggers in play, this and Hills of Dunland combine to make life truly miserable every time you draw a card.

-Dunland Berseker: while not especially powerful I've noticed this enemy makes a lot more additional attacks due to card draw in this quest than in The Fords of Isen where there is alot less card draw hate but more hand size hate instead.

 

I found the following encounter cards however, either strangely beneficial or not very powerful at all:

-Off track: this card is awful if it comes out during stage 1, effectively making you discard your hand every turn rather than every second turn if you cant clear the location but if it comes out during stage 3 it helps you speed through the time counters much faster bringing you closer to the final defense and victory. One worrying thing however is how well this card combos with In Need of Rest, dealing damage to the attached hero even faster.

-Dunlending Ambush: As nasty as this card can be (and it has surge!) of the 4 or 5 times I've had it come out during staging it has been discarded and did nothing 4 of those 5 times as it is attached to the ACTIVE location and if you do not have an active location it does not do anything at all and simply surges. The one time it did attach to a location I thankfully did not have many enemies already engaged so its effect was not too brutal.

-Hithlaeglir Stream: This location makes you draw 2 cards instead of 1 during the resource phase. No cards in this quest punish you for drawing more than 1 card at a time, only for drawing cards in general so this effect doesn't combo with ANY other encounter card and if you're going to be punished for drawing cards ANYWAY why not draw 2 instead of 1 which is only beneficial for the player. Weird encounter card but I've always really enjoyed the occasional slightly beneficial encounter card in harder quests which provide unexpected or surprise help when you're struggling.

-Plains of Enedwaith: This location stops you from drawing a card during the resource phase when it is the active location. So long as you already have a decent amount of cards in your hands I've found this card purely beneficial as it essentially stops all those card draw triggers that go off at the start of each turn during the resource phase. This location can stop Hills of Dunland triggering at the start of each turn, stops Dunland Berserker making an early additional attack, stops Boar Clan Warrior from getting a shadow card and stops Boar Clan stalker growing in size. It also stops the trigger from Wild Men of Dunland and Foothills of Hithlaeglir as well. It also only has 2 threat and 2 quest points so can be instantly cleared by Asfaloth and provides very little threat. Pretty much the least harmful and best possible card to be revealed during staging.

 

I honestly found that the encounter cards and the way they all combo together is so much worse than the forced effects of the various quest stages. So long as you plan for the trap you can just lose an item or two. Similarly with stage 1 so long as you use the most important/helpful cards in your hand over the first two turns you shouldn't lose too much and actually get to draw new cards (even if it's only 2 (plus the one from the resource phase so really you end up with 3, this also however triggers card draw encounter effects twice like I said above...) which could potentially be better than those you had to discard.

Really impressed by the quest and from my experience so far think it is very fun and thematic as well. The only issue is how complex and finicky it can become if four or five draw triggers are in play. Time counters on the last stage can be slightly tricky as well if Off Track is in play and many enemies are engaging each turn, I found on my first attempt I made a couple of small mistakes (mainly Off track being attached to a location and me forgetting to remove an additional time counter from its effect once or twice) so made sure on the second attempt that any time any player drew any amount of cards OR any time a time counter was going to be removed I checked every engaged enemy, every card in staging, the current location and any condition attachments on players. I don't believe I made any mistakes (or at least hope not!) the second time but it took ALOT longer, probably around an hour long game (two handed) as I was constantly checking and double checking everything. I think the quest is really awesome and well designed but can have far too many moving parts during certain play throughs of it. I certainly hope that all future quests will not involve this level of complexity and this many triggers/moving parts every turn of game play. Don't get me wrong I do want quests with new mechanics and a certain level of complexity but I hope that is not just done in similar ways to this quest too often. I also really hope that time counters will appear on a handful of quests in the future but not all of or most of them, as great as they are I really don't want to see them used in every quest.

You mention you had enought attack power to Kill the chief,

You know he can't be killed right? He sticks around till the end of the game. Good report!

Thanks man!
Yeah, I just meant that if you could attack and defeat him I would have utterly annihilated him :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
 

I noticed early on in spoilers that his text read cannot leave play and speculated that there would maybe be text on the last stage allowing him to only be defeated at the very end or when no other enemies are in play or something specific:

 

>  
> 
> > I haven't yet played the scenario, but it's listed as difficulty 7 and it uses the Dunlending Warriors and Weary Travelers encounter sets. Since there are no locations in those encounter sets, The Dunland Trap has several locations, and they interact with card draw. A unique (mini-boss) enemy and a unique location are set aside at the beginning of the quest, time counters remain important, and there's a 20 engagement cost enemy to make life interesting for low threat decks.
> 
> Can't wait to smash some Dunland face! Looks like you can't kill Chief Turch till the last quest stage or something, he reads "cannot leave play". Removing a time counter every time an enemy engages seems pretty **** nasty too, especially when combined with cards like In Need of Rest from weary travelers!

According to the rules, "The enemy leaves play, Either by being defeated or as the result of a card effect."

This could suggest that Chief Turch can be destroyed but this does not imply that he leaves play, making his Forced action active until the end of the game, but preventing him to attack again because que is destroyed... 

This could explain why he has a relative low defense and hit points and not the trait "indestructible".

What do you think about this?

Even if you allow to destroyed him, why would he stop attacking ?

According to the rules again "An enemy remains engaged with a player until it is defeated or until a card effect returns it to the staging area, engages it to another player, or removes it from play."

He is not removed from play but he is defeated and then he stop being engaged...

Well, if I follow your logic : he is defeated => is not engaged with a player.

But his passive is "engage the first player" so he will remain engaged...

but every indestructible enemy has had defense and HPs - i think they are just there for flavor.

You're right.

And the infinite loop continue...

Anyway with the trait indestructible and inmune, it would be easier, if this is the real way to play the chief turch.

It is rare if it has defense and hpoints.

 

One good idea that it would make sense is something like: when the players win the game, damages tokens become victory points.

Coming back on Blue Mountain Trader : I realy dislike the card. It is so not in line with the spirit of the game. I would love to have a quick errata with "once per turn, only".

Until the errata is out, the card is banned at my table.

...or you could play it as if it had "Limit once per turn." already. It's a good card regardless of it's ability.

I still don't see what is so powerful about being able to move your resources around however you want. You still have a limited number of resources. Just because it would make Gondorian Fire and Blood of Numenor powerful? Just putting Steward of Gondor on a character is much more efficient.

Just to make sure I get this right ... in stage 1B , even if I explore the active location at once, at the end of teh refresh phase, one time counter is removed, and next turn the second, thus I lose the cards on my hand, am I right?

Yes, it is true. But is not so bad. You have 2 turns to play the cards you want. After, you 'recycle' your hand. The bad thing is if there are encounter cards that increase his power when one player draws.

I have not posted in a long time, but I just have to.

I am not used to loosing again and  again....but this quest seems too hard for me. 

I don´t play as much as I used to, maybe that´s the problem. I made 5 different decks so far and have not won in 12 games.

 

It don´t seem to get the right mix of hereos. Brutal. If I manage to get to stage 2B, I have nothing to fight with against most of the time 2 enemies. And then I get to 3B and here comes the Chief. And what the hell is up with surge in this quest. One time I surged 4 cards.

 

I hobe I win soon so I can get to The Three Trials.
