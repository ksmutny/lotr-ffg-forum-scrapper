Some shadow effects say "the defending player discards an attachment he controls."  Even if you do a Sentinel defense and defend for another player, the "defending player" is still the player that the enemy is engaged with.

 

But how about cards like this:

"Discard a non-objective attachment you control."

 

Is "you" shorthand for "the defending player," or would this hit the player with the Sentinel defender?

I think it means the character defending, not the player, as the wording is different from the "normal" sentence.

And the shadow effect plainly says "you" to the defending character I think.

this is just my reasoning, and there is only one way to know for certain. Ask caleb....

I'm leaning toward the "defending player" interpretation.  The more I think about it, the more that seems right.  If a shadow effect said 'assign 3 damage among characters you control,' I would have the defending player do that, not the player with the Sentinel.

 

I don't think 'you' ever refers to a character.  At the very least, characters don't 'control' attachments -- players do.

I agree with "you" = the defending player for the very reasons you mentioned, GrandSpleen. At least, that's how I've been playing the game since day 1. I'm going to be pretty annoyed if it turns out that's incorrect.

Oops!  This is in the most recent version of the FAQ.  "You" does indeed mean "the defending player."

 

(1.52) “The defending player” When an enemy makes an attack against a player, or a character controlled by a player, that player is “the defending player” regardless of whose character is declared as a defender. Card effects, including shadow card effects, that target “the defending player” or “you” still target the player who the enemy is attacking even if another player declares one of his characters as a defender for that attack.

yeah you are right, it always refers to the defending player.

 

Edit: didn't see posts further down already confirming this

Thought it had been covered in the FAQ, but didn't have time to check when I made my previous post. Thanks for confirming, GS.
