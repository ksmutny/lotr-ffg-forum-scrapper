After you have have already traveled to a location in the staging area and completed it, what do you do if the same location appears from the encounter deck into the staging again later.  Do you need to visit and complete it again?  I have also had several cards with the same location in the staging area at the same time.  This does not seem to be reasonable.  Do you need to visit each location more than once and should the same location contribute to the threat level multiple times (if the same card appears more than once)?

yep- they arent unique- so you treat them all seperatly, and if a location card IS ever unique, then theres only 1 copy anyways

think of it if there are two copies of a location in play at once then they are extra threatening, and so contribute more threat to the staging area and take twice as long to get over

"Okay, guys, I REALLY think we need to go check out that Necromancer's Pass."

we have an house rule that put all the same locations together.

You also drop threat level quicker when you travel, but it raises quicker as you take longer to explore (you add all the progeress tokens requisites of all cards, but apply once all their tratis and abilities).

 

I hope I was clear enough - I'm Italian and my English is not perfect at all.
