Is there any type of game board that has been able to purchase online or custom made that is sold for the card game? I'd love to have a set-up board and places to set my allies

If you go over to boardgamegeek (bgg) and look up the game, in their "files" section for the game are quite a few fan designed playmats which are very very good. You can then use a store such as inkedplaymats.com to get them printed.

I have the two player one from bgg its awesome.

If printing as a playmat (similar to a large soft mousemat, VERY nice as a card surface) isnt good for you, im sure the same designs will print onto card or similar.

Any inkedplaymats.com altenrative solution for europe? The plus 20$ shipping is a bit too much.

Patriot Games in UK do a printing service but the only do the standard size mat whereas the double size mat I wanted for LotR I had to go to inkedplaymats for. Patriot Games might be cheaper for you :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
