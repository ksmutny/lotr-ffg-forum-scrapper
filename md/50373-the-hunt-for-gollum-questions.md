So I just played through The Hunt for Gollum, and had a blast beating it with two players.  However, a couple questions came up:

#1) Lets say that Signs of Gollum is attached to your active location.  If you successfully quest, resulting in the active location being fully explored and discarded, do you 1) immediately attach Signs of Gollum to a hero OR 2) put Signs of Gollum in the staging area to be snagged the next time that you successfully quest? (i.e., the next round or later)

#2) Quest card 1B reads something like (paraphrased): "Forced: Whenever the players quest successfully, the first player must draw 3 cards, and select 1 of them to put in the staging area.  Discard the other 2 cards." If you are currently on quest card 1B and successfully quest, adding enough progress tokens to complete the current quest card to move to quest card 2A, do you trigger the Forced effect on 1B?

Some other players' thoughts would be very appreciated.

I've played it that when you complete the location signs of Golum goes into the staging area to be picked up the next time you quest successfully.

I also play like this. there is the force effect. And the force effect resolve first any other responses. Looks like is right but still..... Put tokens on the quest cards is response effect???? There is some doubts. Anyway need to wait for the FAQ.

 Oh jeez, looks like I had completely missed the other thread.   Thanks for the link, wlk, and thanks for everyone else's input.

 So another interesting question just came up:

My teammate and I were setting up a game, and while we were revealing encounter cards for quest phase 1A, we turned over Old Wives' Tales, which reads: discard 1 resource token from every hero, for any hero that cannot discard a resource token, exhaust that hero."

Of course, since we hadn't gotten to the first resource phase yet, do all our heroes spend the first round exhausted?  I would imagine so, but ****, harsh.

It's times like that I wish I had Eleanor on the quest with me.

Yes this happen with me couple of times in setup. But is not really bad until you draw clue card with Hunter and some big threat location......

Yes, I play it that way: if you can resolve a card from the encounter deck at the start, you'll resolve it. In the same notion, if you draw Necromancers Reach you're lucky - a treachery card that doesnt do harm at that point and you're lucky not to have a location or enemy in the staging area from the start.

 I just finished playing The Hunt for Gollum quest, and the Mordor Hunter I was engaged with got Signs of Gollum as its shadow card.  Does that mean the Hunter's attack is increased by an extra 2 because another clue is in play?  I played it that way, but it got me wondering.

## 11 [Shelfwear on July 27, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50373-the-hunt-for-gollum-questions/?do=findComment&comment=505130)

You did right, in play means everywhere except discard pile, hand, encounter deck or your card deck. For the Hunter from Mordor it doesnt matter if the clue cards are in the staging area (unclaimed or still guarded) or claimed by any hero or even guarded by the active location. When a hunter comes into play while there are no clue cards it is a good idea to engage him and kill him off before he gets stronger when the first clue card comes into play. He doesnt become weaker, only stronger as time passes...

From the rulebook (p. 25):

"In play" refers to cards that have been played or put into play (in a player's play area), to cards that are waiting in the staging area, to the currently revealed quest card, and to encounter cards that are engaged with that player.

So, I would say that the shadow card is not "in play" and thus a shadow card clue won't boost the Hunter.

However, having reread that definition, I find it weird that the active location is not specifically mentionned as being "in play".

oops, right, I obviously misread the question. Of course clue cards revealed as shadow cards are not treated as "clue" cards bc only the effect below the line (if any) is used and the rest of the card is void. Sorry again, should read forum posts slower... :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]
