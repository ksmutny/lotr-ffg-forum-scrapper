Hi,

The card 'swarming insects' from Journey to Rhosgobel has a shadow effect that reads: if a character has more damage than each other character deal three additional damage to that character. Does this mean more damage than the number of other characters in play? Or more damage than the collected damage of other characters? Thanks, Dave.

Look at all your characters: does one of them have more damage than any other?  If so that character gets three additional damage. It doesn't matter how many characters in play or the collected damage.

 

Example: There are five characters in play. One character has two damage, three characters have one damage each, and one character has no damage. Result: the character with two damage gets three additional damage.

 

Example: There are four characters in play each of which has one damage. Result: no one takes any additional damage (since "1" is not more than "1").

 

Thematically, the insects are swarming whoever has been wounded the most and feast on that character. If there is an all way tie, the insects cannot decide.
