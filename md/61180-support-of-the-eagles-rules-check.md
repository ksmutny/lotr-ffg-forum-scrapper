Hi there, im in the middle of my first all dwarf quest through Mirkwood and really loving it. Just come across a query, ive turned Gimli into a killing machine as he has 3 wounds and a dwarven axe on him(giving him 7 attacks). Ive just pulled Support of the Eagles out and have attached that to Gimli too. My query is that this card will give Gimli the 2 attacks from my eagle ally that is in play(giving him 9 attacks) ...BUT can i now use that eagle ally card in a normal way, i.e can he still attack or defend,  OR (seeming as he is now supporting Gimli) are his stats ignored?  Sorry i may not have explained this well but looking at it from a battle point of view, i cant see how an eagle can support Gimli AND fight on its own, thats two attacks or defends per round.

 Yes, the Eagle is still free to do whatever you want.  Support of the Eagles is excellent!

Wow! Cheers Scott for clearing that one up. I thought it was too good to be true! Thats a hell of a card. I can now proceed and pummel Ungoliant Spawn into the ground.

For even more fun, I like putting 2 Support of the Eagles cards on a hero with Unexpected Courage. Now that one hero can defend AND attack with the bonus. It works best when you have a few 'attachments' on Eagles of the Misty Mountains. Great for when you need to take on a real big bad guy and Gandalf isn't around to help. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Ok thanks for the advice. Bring on the big guys! Theyve been pumping me for months.

Yeah, support of the eagles can be pretty fantastic under the right circumstances.

Also, this thread would be great in the rules sub-forum. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
