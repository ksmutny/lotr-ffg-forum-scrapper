Hello,

This card will be part of the Adventure Pack "The battle of Carn Dûm", but I want to try it out.

Would it be possible to attach it to a Side Quest? Or only to normal quest cards?

Side quests are still "quest cards," so you can attach it to a side quest.

I actually proxied two copies and threw them in my deck a while ago. I think it is probably a really really good sideboard card but not that great a card overall. In certain quests it was amazing (any with 3 or more quest stages as opposed to only one or two or anything with lots of archery) but then in others (only one or two quest stages and next to no archery) it was either unusable or only the card draw could be chosen. Also while 2 cards for every player is pretty **** nice if you are only playing one or two player those couple of cards could have been drawn more easily and far faster with other drawing effects. I think ultimately it will be a great card for decks that feature many side quests, otherwise it can be a fantastic sideboard card for certain quests but there are definitely quests and times when it is next to useless or at least very unreliable.

question about "The Long Defeat" .. e.g. Elrond-hero is in play an a player heals 5 characters by one point each .. does he get a maximum of 10 points healed?

Can´t see why not seeing as Elrond´s ability triggers off healing damage with a card effect; The Long Defeat heals damage and it is a card effect.

Though to get the maximum of 10 damage healed you would have to divide the healing onto 5 different characters.

Yeah I agree with Nerdmeister, and assume this is like archery damage -- you assign it point by point, then resolve all simultaneously.  So Elrond would have a chance to use his response once for each character healed, as each character would represent one instance of healing as a target for Elrond.
