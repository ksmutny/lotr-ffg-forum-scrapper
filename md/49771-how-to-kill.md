 I think the main problem that I am having in my ongoing quest to defeat Quests 2 and 3 is that I have difficulty killing the Nazgul and the Troll. Is there a card or a combination of cards or some reliable way that you have found to defeat those two big bads? 

Thanks in advance.

 Sneak Attack with Gandalf (or Bjorn)!

1) Play with Gimli

2) attach the Citadel Plate on Gimli

3) let him take a big hit

4) destroy things

Obviously, Sneaky Gandalf and Beorn are good ideas but in case of the Troll who (likely) comes early in the game, it is sort of a tricky tactics. Gimli can be risky, I played him from the start, then stopped and never missed him since. The card that really helps is For Gondor! in the Leadership-oriented deck. The last time we played, Daughter of the Nimrodel actually contributed on killing Nazgul (he must have been really pissed after that whilst sneaking back to some new sort of shape).

If you play some 15 or 18 allies in your deck (or more, obviously), For Gondor! is a wonderful card. You don't even need to have Gondorians about to use it. But in the example I have given above, Denethor blocked the Nazgul without being damaged. It is some card.

Then there are more combat boosting cards, of course. Blade Mastery doesn't seem very strong but can help give the decisive blow (it did many time for me). Blade of Gondolin is great for progress and against Orcs (which is not what you were asking, I know) and the new Dúnedain Mark is a great card for Dúnhere to kill enemies. To kill the biggies though, I'd say mostly Beorn, Gandalf, For Gondor! and ranged characters (especially Legolas) as they can hit it from the other side of the field.

Both the Hill Troll and the Nazgul of Dol Guldur are hard nuts to crack and you need additional events/attachments and couple of turns of preparation to kill them.

For the Hill Troll you can try a blocking hero with a shield increasing attachment then trying to kill him fast enough with everything you have. Forest Snare works wonders as this makes him a lame duck. Of course Gandal is great, direct damage + defend or attack the Troll

The Nazgul is even harder bc he is immune to attachments and kills your Allies. In a two player game it makes sense to engage him before you enter quest stage three but after you have cleared the staging area from other serious dangers. Fighting him in quest phase 3 is harder. Against the Nazgul Tactics and Leadership cards shine with their boosting attack/defense and untapping abilities.

Protector of Lorien and forest snare is the best combo for the troll.Ofcourse you can kill the troll faster with other ways but with forest snare you can slow down things prepare your fellowship and wen you are ready you kill the troll and with all the cards you want in play you can win the game easy.

For the Nazgul Gandalf +sneak attack or beorn is the best way to go.
