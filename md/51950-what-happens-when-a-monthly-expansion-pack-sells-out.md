Hi,

 

Hunt for Gollum is now extremely difficult to find in the UK, and although I thought I had one ordered, this may now turn out not to be the case enfadado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/enfadado.gif]

Anyone know what normally happens with reprints? Presumably FFG must reprint at some point to accomodate new players joining the game in the months to come, but potentially, if HfG (or any other pack for that matter) isn't purchased when it is initially released, how long might we be waiting for a reprint?

Not sure, but I preordered from Barnes & Nolbe (in the US) and got an email last week saying that they had to extend my shipping date.  I dont see how you can preorder something and then they dont have enough to ship?  They had to add 30 days to my expected deliver date so I would say that FFG probably anticipates an initial surge or orders and follows up with the second print.  I am still pissed, at B&N not FFG, because whats the use of a preorder if I dont get it?  I could have gotten it from other sites if I had waited until release...

 

EDIT: i already have Hunt for Gollum, my rant is in regards to CaC.

Hmm...not sure. I got both expansions off Amazon and had no trouble.

Check eBay as well if all Amazon vendors are out.

 CCG Armory, Sci-fi Genre. Just ordered the first two packs from CCG Armory, and their shipping to Europe is very friendly for all the smaller items.

 I got both mine from Amazon as well.  I also saw 4 of each at Wizard's Chest in Denver, though that doesn't help you in the U.K.

It obviously depends on the game and the demand for the expansion. When the LotR Core Set sold out it was reprinted extremely fast. For other games reprinting might take from half a year to a year (or more). If FFG takes the opportunity to update/correct cards when reprinting it might cause further delay.

 The core game and both the first two adventure packs are still in stock at CCG Armory right now. I recommend you UK players grab them while they're hot. Received mine today - took about a week. All sleeved up and ready to build decks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Amazingly, I'm in Nottingham - which shop?

I mostly buy on line, as I like to support  Gamesknight.org.uk (who weren't the ones that let me down on the HfG purchase, incidentally..)

Since this thread was resurrected, a HFG-Reprint is already on it's way (as you can see on the upcoming page). So all who had bad luck in summer will get their chance now ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
