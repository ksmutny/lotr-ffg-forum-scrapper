Nice... very nice. I'm seriously considering dropping Lore for Tactics in my 3-sphere Silvan deck.

Nice art and great in multiplayer. Seems like it requires a specific deck for solo play so you can keep enemies not engaged with you and benefit from its ability, which is intriguing.

Wow with Celeborn plus Galadriel this 2 cost ally can quest and attack for 3 and deal 1 damage to an enemy, great cost benefit ratio. Yeah Tactics needed another Silvan ally, and she pairs awesome with Rumil. Does anyone know the release date of this AP?

Instainclude in any tactics deck regardless of silvan synergy being present in the game or not.

> Instainclude in any tactics deck regardless of silvan synergy being present in the game or not.

I'd say "almost" insta-include, but you certainly want her in a direct damage deck.

certainly for multi-player guys, like us.

for solo it is still good, but not a auto include imo.

 

great card, great art. 1 happy camel here!

Yeah, I forgot to add "multiplayer". It's just natural to me, because I rarely play solo.

By the way, with this thing coming out, such archaic card as Horseback archer ceases to exist technically.

This card is dooooope! I have no idea what I'm going to drop from my deck to use this card.

Well, if they increase the synergies for Tactics Rohan, then the Horseback Archer might be useful again, but he hasn't really been all that useful for a while, and certainly Galadhon Archer doesn't help him.

I was hoping this and the Road Darkens would come out the same day, but it doesn't look like that's happening. Hopefully we get Nin-in-Eilph soon.

****...  I really like that ally!

 

Great to have another non unique, non Lore, Silvan ally - especially being Tactics and ranged! Really like the Silvan play style and synergies. I hope that the next non unique Silvan ally is has more than 1 hit point.

Their fragility seems to be a running theme. Odds are we'll see one more non-unique spirit ally. Interested to what the ability will b

Not likely. The next one should be Spirit and it seems like they're only giving the 2-cost allies 2 or 3 stat points. I'm betting we'll see the Spirit one with 2 willpower, 1 hit point, and no other stats. They kinda have to keep the stats low to keep Celeborn's ability from being too awesome. The Silvans are mostly designed to specifically be weak, which is sorta why (thematically) they pop in and out: they don't like being attacked. They like to pop out and deal some damage with their bows and arrows and then run away.

 

If the 2-cost Spirit Silvan ally has 2 willpower, he'll probably replace Silvan Refugee in just about every Silvan deck. He'll have the same willpower, can potentially cost the same amount, will have no downside (leaving play when someone else does), and will have an enters play ability. Why would you want the Silvan Refugee, unless you're doing a mostly Spirit deck and need some extra Spirit allies.

This ally I personally knew about so it doesn't surprise me really, except in the art which is very good, but I think the ally is great and it really does seem that Tactics is essential to the Silvan deck... what do you think? I think Lore and Leadership are essential to it, Leadership because of Celeborn (one of the best balanced "permanent" stat boost in a card game IMO) and O Lorien! for affecting all spheres, and Lore for The Tree People.

Yeah - but one can hope...

Ability wise... I'm assuming that since; Island Among Perils & Galadriel have reductions and Free to Choose cancels that its either none (as joezim007 suggests) or it will interact with locations in some way.

I didnt suggest that it would have no ability. In fact I would be very surprised if it did not havean enters play ability.

Cool - that would work for me too... currently trying balance out two handed Silvan decks (with splashes of Noldor) and could happily include another low cost spirit Silvan :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yea, i just built 2 Silvan decks that have proven pretty decent together in 2 player games. I wouldnt hesitate to replace Silvan Refugee in those decks. Im always surprised how well 3 sphere decks work for Silvan because so many cheap cards.

Even better, with tri-sphere being the standard and Oh!Lorien, I find myself not using Steward of Gondor at all, even solo! I wonder if I am the only one.

It's a long time since i stopped using it outside of Gondor decks. I only use it thematically, plus it's a bit OP for most decks.
