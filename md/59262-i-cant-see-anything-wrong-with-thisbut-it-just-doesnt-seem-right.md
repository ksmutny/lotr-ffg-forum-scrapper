it was the combat phase, only had goblin archer in staging area....had haldir with 1 point of damage on him and ready.....i also had silvan tracker....

now what i wanted to do was exhaust haldir so when he readied next turn tracker would heal him, so i attack the archer with haldir being ranged, but the point is i knew he couldnt damage the archers 3 defence but did it just so he was exhasuted and thus could ready and be healed....

i cant see anything wrong with any of that, i declared a legal attack, but something just doesnt seem right with it....

You cannot attack creatures in the staging area.

Ranged only allows you to attack enemies engaged with other players.

(Unless goblin Archer has some text on it saying otherwise - I don't have KD yet sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif] )

 From a thematic standpoint, don't we often take on challenges that we know we can't win, but we try anyway? Obviously the logic of the card game makes this a bit different, as far less variables can apply as they do in real life, but we still go for that hit, even if we know it won't do anything.

Again, thinking thematically, perhaps Haldir attacked merely to test the enemy's resolve and see if an alternate strategy could be generated.

yes, good one, or perhaps he shot and merely missed?

Several enemies engage people like denethor and Dain and end up giving them no damage, but they still attack and sometimes get the benefit of shadow card effects, why can't we benefit too?

And again if you want to explain it thematically, a character who merely sits on the sidelines and doesn't help with questing, defending, or attacking is not someone who he elvish folk would want to really help out, so Haldir taking an action, though ultimately futile, proves that he wants to contribute, and therefore is deserving of some elvish medicine.

THIS is why I love this game!

yeah the themes great, though probably why i lose so much as im not really concentrating on strategy and instead going whooo isnt that a nice scenario.....or thats great artwork....i think ill keep that in the staging area to look at (im joking...i dont really do that)

Or maybe Haldir cant read the armour value printed on the goblins card?

this is a legal move. Attacking a legal target taps it... untapping will heal... just cause the monster has the defense to not get damaged dosn't make teh attack illegal.

Agreed.  With this game, sometimes you need to use every possible advantage you can in order to succeed.

No. As stated above a ranged character cannot attack an enemy in the Staging Area.
