Dear friends,

 

short question: got my CatC today :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] AJtR is also on its way :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] lucky me ;-)

anyway - catc has only 2 stage cards right? Am I right in assuming that if I just clear the 2 cards, that I've won the game? Just because there is now XXXXX players win the game, as was in every core set quest and HfG...

 

thanks a lot, see you guys around

Correct. Get rid of every Troll, place 1 progress on the quest and you've won.

Anybody had to kill off one (or more) of the four unique Trolls for the second time before winning the quest? We got the Hill Trolls during stage 1 and ground them down (being VP cards, shouldn't see them again), then killed the four uniques during stage 2 in two turns, but there were only a few cards left in the Encounter deck, with a bit more dragging of those combats, we might've had to reshuffle the entire Encounter deck, possible drawing those uniques during staging on the following turn.

Haven't yet had that, but getting the Nazgul for the second time trying to (finally) win Dol Guldur solo was so demoralising all my heroes committed harakiri.

Ouch.

I came close to seeing the Carrock encounter deck reset but finished before that happened. I did have to deal with the Sacked cards getting shuffled back into a depleted encounter deck which had them back in my face the next round.

In 2 players game quite possible reset and reshuffle Encounter deck once.  I had another situation. I kill all the trolls but have 1 Brown land as active location and another on the staging area. Zero tokens on quest. And cards is coming and comings all locations. My threat level was really high!!! I cwnnot get trough locations and start ti give up tnen tracker come and change everything. I finish with 2 cards left in Encounter deck: 2 sucked cards. Lucky!!!

Carrock actually is really tricky specially when you play Coop games. You feel like everything is under control then boom and your threat level is go up and 4 nasty trolls engage you. If they coming all 4 most of the time is the end. When you start to get 3 threat after each troll attack you doomed.

But if you can manage trolls  1 by 1 is can be really boring sometimes........

 Finally got Conflict at the Carrock yesterday.  Great scenario.  Managed to see off those Trolls with my Lore/Spirit deck.  I had Dunhere with three Marks of the Dunedain, plus Berevor with Steward of Gondor and 2 Unexpected Courage, Denethor with a Burning Brand.  With Grimbeorn added to my many allies those Trolls had no chance!

We actually had to wait a turn for both of us to reach threat 34, so both of us took on two trolls, instead of me taking on 3 and my friend taking on 1. He killed both of his trolls that same turn they engaged (angry Gimli, angry Beorn and Grimbeorn among his characters), while I threw two Snowborn Scout to mine, Forest Snared one, then grind them out over the following turn. All we had in terms of threat reduction was 2x Gandalf for me and he used 1x Gandalf, 1x Greeting.
