Is this task possible? I have not yet started mixing and matching decks yet. I just got my butt handed to me in a 2 player match, and was thinking it would be impossible to beat the quest solo.  I have checked a few threads and forums, and everything i see suggests that you beat the quest with a custom deck, and most seem to place it as the harded or 2nd hardest solo quest available.

Is beating it with a premade deck out of the question? Is success so dependent on luck that its not even worth attempting?

i just do not understand why anyone even wants to use pre-made decks... also the answer is no.. probably not.

agreed, however pre-made is the only way to go for the first few games, until you get enough experience,  however captain poe, my advice to you would be to start deck building if you want to go for the hard ones, otherwise things get pretty difficult, yes there are some on here who refuse to deck build, but the vast majority prefer to do so, and this starts to open up many options

as for guldur, i have not beaten it solo, it is the hardest, worse than the shadows of mirkwood finale- return to mirkwood, so i do not think it would be possible

 

have you tried anduin yet? couldnt remember if you had or not....

Don't bother trying. Beating Dol Guldur solo is a very hard task that requires a lot of luck if you use a good custom deck. With the pre-builts, I suppose it's close to impossible.

I beat anduin with the spirit deck... it was actually easy once you figure out the strategy (lower your threat as far as possible, get allies out asap, and then gang up on the trolls with gandalfs help).

 

Should i just skip quest three until I have more cards? or is it feesable with a little luck to beat it solo with a custom deck built from just the box set?

wel theres nothing tpo stop you trying and trying, but you may sicken yourself to the point where its no fun anymore, and there are way better quests out there for solo

 I have gotten close. I enjoy trying, even though it is quite difficult. Having one hero MIA, and then being hit with the treachery that makes another stay exhausted unless you pay two resources is brutal. 

I am confident that it can be done, should the right cards be pulled. And, as I say, I have tried it 5-7 times, and came pretty close once. So, it is not inconceivable, just very difficult. 

That said, I enjoy the difficulty of this game. I think that for the developers, it is far better to err on the side of too difficult than risk making the game too easy.
