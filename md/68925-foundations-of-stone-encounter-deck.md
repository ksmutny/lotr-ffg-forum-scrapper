Which encounter sets are used to build the encounter deck for Foundations of Stone?  Dumb question, I know, but I am confused and want to make sure I am playing with the correct deck.  Thanks very much in advance!

 To my recollection, there was an online article that said we should use the icons on the Quest card and not the decks named on the rules sheet.  There was a weekly article about this some time back.

when you look at the 1a quest card it shows all the icons for the sets needed.

 Here is the article: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3297 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3297] 

Note that there is the same issue with The Long Dark as well.

Thank you for all your kind replies.  I am familiar with the article, but one thing that confused me is that the deck assembled for OCTGN did not follow the quest card.  But after reading your posts, I will follow the quest card.  And thanks for the heads up about The Long Dark.  As in Foundations of Stone, are the sets listed on The Long Dark quest cards also the correct sets?  Thank you very much!

I have it all figured out now.  My Foundations of Stone Quest Card 5A also has an incorrect encounter set icon.  But thanks to the help of you all, careful reading of the article, and careful study of my khazad dum rules insert,  I am all clear now.  I just bought Shadow and Flame, but I haven't had a chance to play Foundations of Stone yet, and I want to do that first.  Thank you!

 Go by the Quest card.

OCTGN is indeed correct with what my actual cards have on them
