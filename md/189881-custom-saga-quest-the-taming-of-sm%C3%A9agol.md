THE TAMING OF SMÃ‰AGOL [https://sites.google.com/view/where-the-stars-are-strange/the-lord-of-the-rings-lcg/the-taming-of-sm%C3%A9agol?authuser=0]

The Land of Shadow Saga Expansion starts with "The Passage of the Marshes" (and technically the first quest card is entitled The Taming of SmÃ©agol [http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fhallofbeorn.com%2FLotR%2FDetails%2FThe-Taming-of-Smeagol-TLoS&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNFHF-BzWzMY5-_lw9aEco4gb8aTJQ]), but it's missing the Emyn Muil part of Frodo & Same travel to Mount Doom.

Thankfully, the Emyn Muil region was explored early in the game [http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fhallofbeorn.com%2FCards%2FScenarios%2FThe-Hills-of-Emyn-Muil&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNGEbawVkr-Fq_8zJD7nl7MEnJL05A], during the first cycle, Shadow of Mirkwood. So I figured I would simply use The Hills of Emyn Muil encounter set to propose a Saga Quest covering the events of the first chapter of The Two Towers (part 2).

To play this quest you need The Hills of Emyn Muil encounter set, the Sauron's Reach encounter set (from the Core Set) and both Gollum and NazgÃ»l encounter sets from The Land of Shadow and The Ring from The Black Riders. I chose to exclude the Orcs of Dol Guldur encounter set for thematic purposes and the added Gollum enemy as well as the NazgÃ»ls gives a bit of tension, on the enemy side.

Of course, I've included Campaign Mode (a campaign card with instructions and a new Boon).

Cool idea, thanks for doing this!

> Cool idea, thanks for doing this!

Seconded... I think the idea comes up every so often, recycling old encounter sets with new quest cards, but you went ahead and actually did it! Bravo.

One thing I noticed is since Bilbo's Pity is not added to the Campaign Pool until after the quest, you can use it once in this quest and still have it to use again one more time. Is this intentional?

Â 

Nope. This should be added to the Campaign Pool from the beginning of the quest.

I'll do the modification.

EDIT: done

Just a thread necromancy to say that the custom scenario has been updated and an OCTGN set is now available.

Neat!Â  I don't use OCTGN but do play physically.Â  I'm currently in the midst of a SAGA game now, and would love to try this with physical cards and proxies.Â  Is it possible to see the card jpegs for the Campaign Reference Card, Quest Cards, and new Boon outside ofÂ OCTGN?

Â 

Thanks!

Since you brought it up, any possibility you or someone could do something for the scouring of the shire?Â

@Nickpes [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/205969-nickpes/]Â I didn't exactly brought it up. It's somewhere in the back of my mind but 1) I want to see if it's not the GenCon quest 2020 2) if it's not, I want to see if @Seastan [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240509-seastan/]'s A Long-Extended Party team will tackle this.

@EBerling [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/304352-eberling/]Â yes, it is absolutely possible, here:

Actually there is a scouring of the shire - for campaign mode too!

Here it is!

Couple of questions:

First, are Poisened Counsels and Saruman's Voice removed for this? I didn't see any burden sets on the campaign card.

Second, is the effect on Bilbo's Pity contingent on removing at least one damage, or can you essentially feint an undamaged Gollum by exhausting the Ring?

Yes they should be removed, it's just that I forgot to place the icons on the card, it has been corrected.

Yes, you should remove at least 1 damage.

Changes are being made to the website, pdf, image and OCTGN file to reflect that.

Alright, just played through this quest in my thematic saga campaign. Here is the deck I used:Â https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/212177 [https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/212177]. (I decided since Gandalf didn't die in Moria, he went with Frodo...)Â 

The first thing I noticed is how thematic and fun the quest is, and how newly relevant it made the Hills of Emyn Muil encounter cards. Cards like Impassable Chasm and Slick Footing felt so much more thematic now, especially the art on Slick Footing.

I do have one small question.

Amon-Lhaw.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/The-Hills-of-Emyn-Muil/Amon-Lhaw.jpg]Â 

What are the effects of Amon Lhaw on the One Ring? Does Frodo no longer change players during Refresh? What about if he leaves play?
