Hello,

A friend of mine is looking for Gimli promo. He has an  Aragorn promo and he could offer some money for the change.

If someone is interested, please mail me.

Thank you

I have an extra Gimli. I'm looking for the "Game Of Thrones" alt-art plot card, yes that's the name of the card, for AGOT 2.0 from Gencon if that's possible.
