Glamdring andÂ Orcrist both have a response "Response: After attached hero destroys an enemy" that happens only when the hero by himself destroys an enemy or also when it destroys an enemy participating to an attack with other characters?

With other chars is also fine. If ever alone, the card would say so, such as on the attachment Firefoot.

JYoder is correct. The character does not have to attack and destroy the enemy alone, he just needs to participate in the attack.
