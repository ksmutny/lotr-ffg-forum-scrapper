Yes, I saw a video of last years GenCon and saw the game in action or I should say the prototype. So maybe in a couple of days we will seeÂ  a video tutorial with offiacial rules for the game? That would be nice. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Considering FFG has done one for every LCG they have I would say this is already guaranteed.
