Those are some quality photos! were those take with a potato? Seriously tho, thanks for the spoilers

Hirgon looks great as far as my French goes:

When Hirgon quests successfully play a tactics ally from your hand, reducing it's cost by 1. Then, you my increase your threat level by 1 to give this ally  +1att & +1def until the end of the round.

I like him!

No neutral card? And only one (non-hero) Tactics?

Edit: Oh yeah, those were The Free Peoples and Keep Watch, which were already spoiled. But the Rider of Rohan and Dunedain Lookout were also already spoiled so since they were posted here I assumed this would be everything.

 

Also, between rusty French and familiarity with the game I think I can follow what all these cards do. They all look pretty cool.

I think the song attachment gives +1 willpower per attached song, but that's as far as my high school French will take me.

## 9 [PocketWraith on May 3, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248747-beneath-sand-french-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=2765642)

Approximate translations:

Leadership attachment, Haradrim Spear (or something like that):
Attach to a Hard character. Restricted.
Attached character gets +1 attack.
Response: After attached character is declared as an attacker, it gets +3 attack for this attack. Then discard Haradrim Spear.

Leadership event, no idea of title:
Play only if you control a unique character with the Warrior trait and another unique character with the Scout trait.
Response: After the players commit characters to the quest, discard a non-unique enemy in the staging area. Then, reveal an encounter card.

The Red Arrow:
Artifact. Item.
Limit 1 per deck. Attach to a Gondor hero.
Attached hero gets +1 willpower.
Valour Response: After attached hero quests successfully, add The Red Arrow to the victory display to search the top 5 cards of your deck for an ally and put it into play.

 
Spirit attachment (not sure of title):
Song.
Attach to a Hobbit hero. Limit one per hero.
Attached hero gets +1 willpower for each Song attached.
 
Lore attachment is Valiant Warrior for Rangers, Spirit and Lore allies were spoiled already.

Yes! Hirgon and the Red Arrow finally! And they seem very cool. Resource acceleration, slight willpower boost and card fetch in Tactics? Count me in for sure. Not only that, but Hirgon is one of my favorite tertiary characters from Lotr. Can't wait to build around him.

Forgot to mention the Spear gives a passive +1 attack. As for the names, the Leadership event was spoiled as Hunting Party, whereas the Spirit event would mean something like "Songs at the Fireplace".

Hirgon's boost is until the end of the round (or phase) surely?

"fin de tour" has got to be end of round.  An attack/defense boost until the end of phase in questing would very very rarely be worth a threat increase.

## 15 [Estel Edain on May 3, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248747-beneath-sand-french-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=2765939)

The flavour text for the song is from Bilbo's song in Rivendell the evening before the Fellowship set out, after giving Frodo Sting and the mithril coat:

I sit beside the fire and think
of how the world will be
when winter comes without a spring
that I shall ever see.

Its title could be Fireside Song. I'm delighted with it for my thematic campaign, especially for the Land of Shadow/Mountain of Fire Frodo and Sam quests where I want minimal allies. The Black Serpent contains Song of Hope, a 0 cost Leadership song that can combo with Fireside Song, as well as Burst into Song, which readies all heroes with a Song attachment. A non-degenerate song deck with Love of Tales (although you'd want Song of Wisdom relatively early if you're not mono-Lore, to allow you to play more copies of Love of Tales), Fireside Song,  and Burst into Song looks like a fun and perhaps decently strong possibility.

True, it's end of the round. My bad. I somehow read "fin du jeu". I'll edit it in too.

Edit: ah, I see what I did there; I messed up while also reading Red Arrow. <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]

Red Arrow is my favorite, 1 resource for 1 willpower, discard for free (if in top cards) ally.  With Steward of Gondor there's no shortage of Gondor heroes, but even without that there's three native Gondorians in tactics who can easily be part of successful questing (for the ally effect) -- Mablung, Imrahil, the brand-new Hirgon, and Boromir.  With Red Arrow and TaTheoden, TaBoromir could quest for 3 and ready if necessary for combat.

I've gone partway through the saga pairing a Dori deck with a Caldara deck, with this card I could hypothetically discard Caldara in turn one (after successfully questing) for four spirit allies.  (Emery & Sword-Thain in Caldara's opening hand, Imrahil in top 5 cards of the deck, Red Arrow in Dori deck's opening hand).

I am weirdly stoked about a +1 willpower attachment in Tactics. Looks like another great pack for player cards! 

## 20 [Gizlivadi on May 4, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248747-beneath-sand-french-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=2767151)

It's been a while for me since I was so excited for a new Tactics hero. I mean, Imrahil is probably the most interesting one to come as of late, but I haven't really thought about building with him until I saw this hero. I don't know why, but I really want to build a deck with those two.

## 21 [donkler on May 4, 2017](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248747-beneath-sand-french-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=2767350)

Ally Arwen with Sword-thain, that new Ranger attachment, 2 Ranger Bows, and 2 Unexpected Courage. Every round 2 wp on quest, 2 direct damage, and +3 defense/+3 sentinel characters. Probably not worth the setup, but she will do so much!

Imrahil is so much fun and so good. You really need to give him a try.

No noeed of the ranger bows you can block directly with Arwen and always give to her the +1 boost. It seem more powerful to me this way ;).

Like 13nrv says it work well with Eleanor and Merry. At least with 4 players table, because with only one or two players this won't work a lot. But it seem cool but not overpowered to replace every treachery you want with a 3-cards combo. When you play Eleanor there is numerous time when you don't want to use her ability. It is clearly powerful enough to build around but not too much so we don't we need an errata.

don't forget the Spare Hook and Cloaks!  just keep swapping them around and readying/exhausting Arwen to keep applying her boost (since it only requires that she exhausts)

 

i really like the song attachment, and i'm glad songs are getting more support.  the Love of Tales errata was desperately needed, but thankfully songs aren't going anywhere.

 

i also love the Haradrim Spear.  it's a more expensive Vassal of the Windlord that gives you a consistent +1 atk until you need a big hit for that turn to close out a kill.  2 for 1 attack isn't great, and 2 for a one-time attack of +3 isn't great either, but it's really versatile.  plus more weapon attachments outside of Tactics is always welcome.

Spare Hood and Cloak exhausts when you use it.

i did not say it was an infinite combo, but it's worth several more uses over the course of a couple turns since it's not limit 1 per character, and it's a bit easier to use than some other things since the cloak itself will exhaust Arwen instead of needing to be able to quest, have a target to defend/attack, etc.

Yeah Arwen ally is one of the few ways to make Spare Hood actually good. If you have two in play you can just swap them back and forth between Awren and some other character every round. You get an extra defense from Arwen without the loss of any actions. Doesn't seem like much, but it can enable some pretty bonkers stuff with the Vigilant Dunadan.

yeah exactly, and like i said, the really cool thing is it forces an exhaust on Arwen, so if you have all those other readying effects for her, the cloak is a good way to exhaust her again and ping her ability

I hadn't realized this combo before - no surprise - but by a strict reading of the cards it doesn't appear that there is a limit to the number of times that Arwen can trigger or target a character per turn.  In other words, using SH&C with Arwen (ally) and Tactics Boromir you can essentially trade threat for defense if you wanted to.  Is that right?

Sure. You can also use it to trade cards for defense with Watcher on the Brunien, but that's much less ideal.

There is indeed no limit to Ally Arwen's ability if you can find multiple ways to exhaust and ready her every round. You can give Sentinel to several characters with her and play Hold Your Ground! to ready everyone if you are in Valour threat. Also, if you find a way to exhaust her in the Planning phase, you can sneak a Raven-winged Helm or The Day's Rising on someone that isn't normally Sentinel. It's a shame her hero version is so good too.

No you can't. Spare hood and cloack can only be used once per turn because it exhaust when use.

But I guess the question is when you pass it to the new hero does it get re-readied?  If not, and there is no reason to believe is does ready, then you are right.

Spare Hook and Cloak readies during the refresh phase with everything else, and that's currently the only way it can ready.

but it still does ready/exhaust Arwen several times per turn as you swap your copies around, up to 3 times per turn (which is actually a lot, considering you only really get on guaranteed exhaust before the combat phase when you quest with her).  you can defend with her in the combat phase and have to exhaust her through some quest effects that may pop up, but those aren't in every quest or indeed, even every round of those quests where they will pop up.
