If I mariners compass (switch) a location with an enemy grappled to it, what happens to the enemy. Do I discard it or does it attach to the new location in play?

I would send that question to Caleb as I don't think that anyone will have a definitive answer. I don't believe that there is any ruling on that at the moment.

Mariner's Compass:: Response: At the beginning of the travel phase, exhaust Mariner’s Compass and attached character to search the top 5 cards of the encounter deck for a location. Switch that location with a location in the staging area. Shuffle the encounter deck.

The location from the staging area leaves play, but hasn't been explored or made active. As written, that means it doesn't trigger the grapple effect of being flipped. Since the grapple card is actingas an attachment it should thus be discarded when the thing it's attached to is gone.

A rules lawyer looking for a soft game experience would thus discard the card.

Fairer responses would be to do a real switch and attach the grapple to new location. Or to have the Grapple keyword trigger when the location leaves play - regardless of why.

I think the second one is the most likely result of an FAQ adjustment.

Thanks for the reply's thankfully the scenario in question never came up as Mariners compass was discarded due to a shadow effect prior to stage 3b. Nevertheless we were able to save the storm caller. I hope this specific question is addressed in a new FAQ. I will also email Caleb in regards to it to find out for sure. thanks again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
