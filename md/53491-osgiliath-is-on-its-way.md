There are some pages starting to go up connected to the forums that suggest that Osgiliath is about to be made available :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  The links are there in the catalog, but the page is "not available for public viewing".  Happy birthday, Bilbo!  Here's some Nazgul to eat your face!

Hahah, I was just about to post something saying where to find the "product not yet available for view" page, and then I noticed that it was available.  Obviously I had to drop everything I was doing and order it. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

For those of you that have any trouble finding it, go to the FFG bar at the top of your screen, mouse over "catalogue," click on "print on demand," and there it shall be.

Would have thought this would be newsworthy on the LOTR LCG main page.

When I mentioned it to the guy at FLGS a while back, he said it should be - he'd managed to get other FFG print on demand stuff before. That said, the company who supply FFG stuff to the uk are notoriously useless, so we'll have to wait and see.

 

Yes, a subforum seems ridiculous if that's the ONLY subforum - if this is the start of them organising this place, then good - although i'd have gone more AGoT style personally - generl, rules, deck building, organised play etc.

Ordered my copy.  I'm so glad I didn't pay $60 or more for a copy from eBay.  And I was beginning to wonder if FFG was going to release it at all.

For those wanting a CHALLENGE then order this scenario, it's the most difficult of all the current expansions, and I believe it will remain the most difficult for at least a year.  This will be the type of scenario that they'll use in tournaments because of it's unpredictability and almost impossible creature (Witch-King); yet it is also very realistic to LOTR and simply compliments the Return to Mirkwood theme.  BUY IT!!

Having played both ICE Middle-Earth and Decipher LOTR (for more hours than I care to admit) I'm now the most fond of this product, if they keep this impressive product developing for a couple of years combined with the release of both Hobbit movies it will be the second largest game in the world and may even give that OTHER card game a run at number ONE!!

 

Thank you FF!

 K guys, most of my play is solo...this isn't even possible to beat with a 50 card solo deck is it? I don't have a ton of use for this if I can't beat it (besides awesome card art to add to the already awesome collection).

You should find out. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I expect that eventually we'll see "I beat Osgiliath solo!" posts showing up... but that might be after we get a lot more player cards for better deck building.

Shipping to Germany for $4, that's cheaper than ordering from a shop located in Germany... ;-)

Sweet! I shall be ordering mine this weekend.

As for those of us in the UK, I recently ordered the POD for Death Angel and it came safe and sound less than a week later, so I wouldn't worry.

From the product page:

"The Massing at Osgiliath is a challenging scenario that originally ran as a special event at Gen Con Indy 2011 and which we have now made available via Print on Demand. The 45 cards of The Massing at Osgiliath immerse you in the thrills and perils of Middle-earth as your heroes undertake a four-part quest, travel through vital locations on both sides of the Anduin, and confront hordes of new enemies."

Oh, I mostly play solo, so you can believe I'll be trying like hell.  I have no idea what to expect other than its hard as hell, though.

LotR LCG Database has a list of all the cards if you want to take a look.

Good grief!  Ok, definately need some Spirit cards for this one.  Test of Will, Hasty Stroke and Northern Trackers are certainly in order.  As is Frodo, I think, and thus so is Galadrhim's Greeting.  Stand and fight not working on Gandalf anymore kinda sucks.  Being able to Feint the Witch King could be good, but I suck with tactics for some reason.

Anyway, just reading those cards kinda give me a nervous feeling. I like it.  Bring it on Osgiliath!

Hard but possible. I win solo against Osgiliath 2 times from 6 sessions. Yesterday we play 2 games 2 players against Massing. 1 win , 1 lose.

Very cool quest!!! I love it!!!

What are the payment options for POD? I'm not fond of giving my credit card number out on the internet, even if it is a reputable company. I don't suppose they take Paypal?

They do not, I'm afraid.  However, there may be some online retailers who will order a few sets and also take Paypal.  FFG is also small enough that you may be able to contact them directly and give either a credit card number over the phone or simply mail a payment in.

 You cannot order via the website without a credit card.  However, there may be some online retailers who will order a few sets and also take Paypal. FFG is also small enough that you may be able to contact them directly and make some other arrangement.

Paypal used to let you create a virtual credit card number that just pulled from your paypal account. They gave you a 1 time use number that was accepted as a credit card. I'm not 100% sure but I imagine they still do this, poke around on their site.

It says that it will take up to 4 days to actually ship since these are Print on Demand. They have to actually print all the cards, package, and ship them rather than just grab a box from a warehouse and send it out the door.

I ordered within seconds to minutes of it going up and mine still says "Pending Shipping" if that makes you feel any better. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Osgiliath very interesting and difficult quest. There is 4 stages and deeper you go more dangers you meet. Really brutal solo is going  more easy in 2 players game.About 3 and more players  i dont know  (never try). But this quest is not just difficult is really interesting and different. Every stage have different game condition and you must act really different on them. +Enemies have big strengh power , treachery card have nasty effect and on the last stage they effect going even more nasty. Is good example of the good quest in my opinion. There is also some shadow effect which one play for you not against you. Burning brand can make bad job sometimes cose you can lose powerful and really important ally.

## 55 [radiskull on October 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53491-osgiliath-is-on-its-way/?do=findComment&comment=536107)

 It's actually fairly close to the actual cards.  I'm pretty impressed.  The color on the backs of the PoD encounter cards is slightly lighter.  On their own, they look great, but they are distinguishable from the standard encounter cards.  No discernable difference in thickness and shufflability.

## 56 [Tozar on October 3, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53491-osgiliath-is-on-its-way/?do=findComment&comment=536342)

My order still says pending shipping but I have the cards in my hands right now. Go figure. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] I actually like the quality of the POD cards better than the others, mainly because it has a glossy feel to them instead of the normal "you know this is cardboard feel" of the original cards. The gloss finish does make the cards slightly lighter than the others, but you only use this encounter deck for this quest, so that's a non-issue (unless you use them for a custom scenario in conjunction for other encounter cards). I'm actually very pleased with this. This is my first experience with POD and I like a lot so far. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

As for the quality, I think I prefer this set over the standard cards. They are darker and not so shiny, but also I find the typeface looks better. But that may just be a personal preference.

Same here. I recieved my cards when it said my shipping was still pending. Later that day I get an e-mail saying my order has shipped. partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif]
