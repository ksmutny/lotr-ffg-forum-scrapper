Does the Outland trait also count as Gondor? Because in the announcment of the circle they said that Outlands are part of Gonder and only represent the divrent countrys around Minas Tirith. The Hunters of Lamedon got the Gondor Traitâ€¦

nope they dont have the Gondor Trait. No trait is ever implied in another trait. The Hunter is Lamedon is an exception for now
