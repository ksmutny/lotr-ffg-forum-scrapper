Seastan's great joke from yesterday (https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216000-my-best-deck-yet/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/216000-my-best-deck-yet/]) brought to mind a question I thought was interesting: in the name of being able to play easily with others, how strong a deck can you make without any uniques (except the heroes, of course)?

 

I already made a deck designed to minimize conflict, http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/75/have-at-me-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/75/have-at-me-1.0]; it still has a couple copies of Heir of Valandil but could survive without it.

 

I suppose the answer involves Outlands, but what other deck types could do well under this restriction?

Eagles decks would be fine, all they'd lose is access to Radagast, Gwaihir, and Landroval.

 

I don't think there's any essential unique cards for a Hobbit secrecy deck.

 

An Ent deck with hero treebeard could be quite tough without uniques.

You could easily build an effective Mirlonde/Pippin/Rossiel deck under such a restriction.

Yep, I posted a similar deck [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203364-mono-lore-secrecy-support-deck/] and the only unique is Scroll of Isildur, if you even want to count that.
