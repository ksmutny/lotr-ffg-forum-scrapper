When Revealed: Remove the Ring-bearer, and each card attached to it, from the game (treat The One Ring's text as blank while resolving this effect). Reduce each enemy's engagement cost to 0 until the end of the encounter phase. Skip the travel phase this round.

Forced: At the end of the refresh phase, shuffle Seat of Seeing and Forod's Choice into the encounter discard pile. Then, place the encounter discard pile on the bottom of the encounter deck. Starting with the first player, each player creates his own staging area and advances to a different stage 3A of his choice. In player order, each player moves 1 encounter card from this staging area to his. When there are no encounter

 

ok so my question is how exactly does this work? are we moving the creatures in staging around and the encounter cards in deck?

 

also mablung ended up as an enemy in staging with ranger spikes on him cuz of a treachery which read

When Revealed: Attach to a non-Fellowship hero and move it to the first player's staging area. (Counts as a Condition attachment with the text: "Attached hero loses the hero card type and gains the enemy card type with Threat equal to its Willpower and engagement cost equal to its threat cost. If Fallen into Evil is discarded, return attached hero to its owner's control")

 

so first of all do they attach and second will this cause any issues further on with condition removaly stuff?

Ranger spikes: Yes, should attach.  I don't see any reason not to, since the hero who gets Fallen Into Evil becomes an 'enemy' card type.  You can still remove Fallen Into Evil with the usual Condition removal cards, and at that point Ranger Spikes will remain attached to the hero and just do nothing.  

 

About resolution of the quest card effect... the first part is straightforward (remove Frodo, treat enemy engagement as 0, skip the travel phase).  For the next part, just follow these steps:

 

At the end of the refresh phase:

 

1) Shuffle Frodo's Choice and Seat of Seeing into the encounter deck discard pile.  

2) Now put the whole encounter deck discard pile on the bottom of the existing encounter deck (no additional shuffling).

3) In turn order, each player chooses a stage 3 and goes to their own staging area with that card.  This staging area is empty at present.

4) In turn order, each player chooses one card from the existing stage 2 staging area, and moves it to his new stage 3 staging area.

5) Repeat step 4 until there are no cards left in the stage 2 staging area.  Then, discard stage 2.  

6) If any player had less than 4 threat in their staging area when stage 2 was discarded, reveal 1 additional card at that stage (per the stage 3A instructions).

 

The bit about repeating step 4 is not actually written on the stage 2B quest card, but that is an error.  You should not leave any cards in stage 2b.
