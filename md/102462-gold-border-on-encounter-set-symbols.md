Hullo.

 

Quick question - just received The Dead Marshes today and some of its encounter cards have a gold border around their encounter set symbol. What does this indicate?

 

Thanks!

It is meant for easy modo where you replace them if you draw them, or remove them before setup... don't know which one it is.

I wondered if it might have been that or to do with scaling - I haven't read the corebook rules for easy mode for ages, ever since we played a few games of the core sets in Easy Mode and then "graduated".

 

Thanks!

didn't know they make it for older version either... it first appears in black ridders but I have not heard of this before... until now... and I don't have visual to confirm it's the same gold circle...
