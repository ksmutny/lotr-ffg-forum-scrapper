"The first player gains control of Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo Baggins cannot gain resources from player card effects.

If Bilbo Baggins leaves play, the players lose the game. "

What does mean..."the first player gains control of Bilbo"? Shouldn't be that card already set as a hero for a certain player? Or is it added to the deck and when revealed, the first player gains control of it?

If you are referring to saga Bilbo, then he starts in play as a hero. The first player always controls Bilbo and his resources, so as the first player token passes (usually through the standard event at the end of the round, but there are a couple of cards that can pass the first player token), Bilbo is also passed to whoever has the first player token.

But Bilbo is added as a 4th hero for the player in the beginning of the game ?

Yes, whoever is the first player at the start of the game gets Bilbo as a fourth hero at no threat cost. Whenever the first player changes, Bilbo moves to the new first player.
