 Can you play actions/events mid Escape Test? Specifically in between revealing the test cards and the test resolution to pump willpower with Eowyn?

It does not appear so based on the rules. The rules do say that you may take actions or play event cards after you commit character to the escape test and before cards are revealed. So you can pump Eowyn's willpower prior to revealing the escape cards only.
