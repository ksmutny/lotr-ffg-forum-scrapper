# [Buying extra encounter sets?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75763-buying-extra-encounter-sets/)

I know this has come up in the past but I'm looking for a way to get extra encounter sets so that I can build full quests and never have to swap cards around. I've seen one place that sells the encounter sets individually, ToyWiz, but they only have some of the core set ones and I've never heard of them before (and the fact that they still list Hills of Emyn Muil as "Pre-order" kind of frightens me).

Does anyone know a good way to go about this without spending a ton of money buying multiple core (I actually already have 2 core sets, but I'm not buying any more)/deluxe sets? ToyWiz had them priced at about $1 each, and I'd totally be willing to buy several copies of each at that price.

I can't seem to even find any individual stuff on ebay, just the full packs. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

i would keep checking, they may come up. also try posting on the forum (though youve already done that of course) asking to buy

some people will have extras somewhere

I second Svenn's request. It's a pain having to separate and reshuffle encounter decks around and having to keep them apart and all that. I really wish there was a place to buy encounter sets on their own.

I've seen some individual cards (no encounter, just player cards) on some of the foreign ebay sites.

Hey! I'm sorry about the pre-order thing. We've been so busy over the holidays I don't think anyone has looked into what happened there! I let my Â manager know so he can hopefully track it down.
