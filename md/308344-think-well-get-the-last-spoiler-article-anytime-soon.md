We wants it...

Obviously things have changed from the way they had been being released, but the articles were usually coming out a little before or after the expansion two before it came out. At that rate, we should expect it within a week radius of the official release of Under Ash Mountains. If that still holds, we could see it anywhere between late May and early July.

If nothing else, they'll save it for the restart to the industry getting back on its feet. I'm sure the articles will already be written but if it was me I'd hold it so that I have something to release as they pick up work from where it left off. At the start of Lockdown. 

 

Even though this is a kind of Hiatus... we still have the proper LOTR LCG planned hiatus comming?

Oddly; somehow I don't know if I want to see that article anytime soon. That would mark the end of an era for me - after that there wont be no more cards or expansions for this game. Everything (allmost) spoiled.

(Not taking any nightmare packs into account - if there will be any)

I'm happy to wait especially if it won't be released for awhile now. It's going to be a sad day when it comss, especially at the moment as well with having extra time to play and seeing lots of new people finding it and getting involved and knowing there is at best a break and at worst the end of all things.

I would be shocked if they don't release some kind of products consistently coinciding with the amazon LOTR series tbh. Just such a massive waste, look at how immense of a boost The Witcher 3 got to sales from the Netflix show.

I actually expect the article to either be dropped this week or be delayed for a while longer. There are several shops worldwide that are already selling the final AP, and some community members on Discord have the pack in their hands already. If we don't get the announcement article, then we will at least have the spoiled player cards within a day or two.

Really? Can you provide some links? Or at least the title of the AP?

All spoilers are in the #unofficial-spoilers channel in the COTR Discord server. 
The title of the pack was already known a few days ago, it will be the Fortress of Nurn. 

I expect other platforms will quickly adopt the spoilers, but I will not share any images out of respect for how the designers and FFG would want to community to experience the final AP.

Is it a public server or do you need an invitation? Cause I tried to look for it in the public section but no luck (perhaps I had the wrong name)

There is a link to a Discord server. The last one where the links are.

You have to go up quite a bit, a day and a half or so, but I see that one user there has opened a topic here where he posted all the player cards spoiler.
