All in all, the cycle is still kind of a mixed bag for me. While Seastan's ranger deck IS amazing, I'm still bummed that Leadership-Tactics Dunedain aggro (aka Secret Defenders) never became a thing in solo, as opposed to the amazing stuff the Noldor got. With that said, my faves are

Arwen

Veteran of Osgiliath

Silver Harp

Descendants of Kings

Send for Aid

Hero: Arwen. Would have liked to be able to say Dori.... Was hoping for a new spirit or tactics Dwarf but sadly...

Ally: Longbeard Sentry

Attachment: Silver Harp

Event: Reinforcements

Side Quest: Gather Information

Here's hoping the next cycle will make an all Dunedain deck real deal. A new Dwarf hero that can replace Gimli so I can run the ally.

Noldor became topnotch in one cycle! As did victory display.

So excited what next cycle wi bring!

Ally: Wellinghall preserver

Event: Fair and perilous

Side Quest: Send for Aid

Favourite quest, difficult to answer. Most of them had interesting stories and mechanisms, i can say that apart from Carn Dum -mainly because being so difficult was more like a puzzle after all- I liked all of them. Still do not own the last one though

I hope next cycle will bring some Noldor allies that can be used as combat characters, and some Dunedain attachments to make them top tier

I liked this cycle very much, there really was not a dud of a quest.  If anything it was Ettenmoors, it sounds like a quest that should be very challenging, but then it ended up being kind of a walk in the park.  Carn Dum was too hard for me to be very replayable, but I definitely appreciated the challenge.  But about favorites:

 

Hero: Arwen

Ally: Derndingle Warrior

Event: The Door is Closed

Attachment: Secret Vigil
Side quest: Scout Ahead, but definitely have used and will use Gather Information more frequently

 

Quest: Wastes of Eriador

Hero: Aragorn

Ally: Honor Guard

Event: Doom Hangs Still

Attachment: Favor of the Valar

Side-Quest: Send For Aid

 

Quest: Wastes of Eriador

 

I loved the player cards in general throughout this cycle, but found a few of the quest only slightly interesting. I still haven't played the Dread Realm, but I really enjoyed the Wastes of Eriador and Battle of Carn Dum, both those quests were difficult and intriguing. Escape from mount gram is incredibly simple and dull, I understand what they were trying to accomplish and appreciate the attempt, but it did not work out very well, hopefully NM mode will fix it. The Ettenmoors really excited me as I love conflict at the carrock, but it was way too simple. Those safe locations were not necessary for such an easy quest. Most disappointing.  Treachery of Rhuadur was fine but slightly forgettable. 

## 9 [leptokurt on December 25, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1955660)

My thoughts? This has probably the worst cycle so far.

 

Noldor has been good, but not as good as Silvan.

 

Dunedain has been unsatisfying.

 

Player cards in general were not as good as I expected. Mostly because they often didn't help againts the new quests. And has there been any good tactics card instead of Ents?

 

3 quests have been good, 2 not so good (Mount Gram, Dread Realm), 1 crap (Carn Dum).

 

Heroes have been ok, but also not as good as usual. Again, tactics got the short end here.

 

Plenty of new ideas, a lot of which didn't work. I'm thinking of Honor Cards, Mount Gram scenario, Northern Ranger and Dunedain in general. Side quests have been a good idea, but IMO there have been too many encounter side quests. Another good idea was the addition of Amarthiul as anobjective ally, but why in hell did the took him away for the two hardest quests?

 

All in all my disappointment weighs more than my excitement about this cycle. I wasn't too happy about the story/theme either (way too many ghosts and fighting Thaurdir all the time). And as the next cycle looks even worse themewise, I am not sure if I am going to continue to buy the next AP's.

Hero:  Aragorn
Ally: Honor Guard
Event:  Fair and Perilous probably just slightly beats out Horn's Cry
Attachment:  Silver Harp
Side Quest:  Gather Information

Really, really liked this cycle.  I agree that Ettenmoors and Escape from Mt Gram were both underwhelming.   Carn Dum is so hard it's difficult to like,  but even so, there are some really solid quests in this cycle.  I like all 3 quests a lot in the main box (Chetwood, Weather Hills, Deadman's Dike),  Wastes of Eriador is great,  so is Treachery at Rhudaur.  

Side-quest mechanic was hands down the best thing introduced in this cycle,   it's not even close.   Side quests are a great part of the game from both a player SQ and an encounter SQ perspective.   I love everything about side-quests.... except that Delay the Enemy doesn't really have a place.   But that is a miss on one specific card,  the idea of side-quests as a whole I think is really fun and good.

If you think tactics got the short end on heros...  I don't know what to tell you.   Aragorn(T) is so amazing it's crazy.   He's a top notch hero, and considerably stronger than any other hero in the cycle except maybe Arwen (but probably including Arwen).  He's good in a low threat Scorpion style deck, he's good in multiplayer to take threatening targets away from your allies,  he's just all around good.

There have been some great player cards and some not so great ones.   I really love Honor Guard, he helps out so much.  The idea of Horns Cry is great, I was trying to make a deck out of it, it didn't quite work.  Fair and Perilous is great though.  Victory Display is a little wonky,  and I wish Valor actually worked.   It's almost there.  Almost.  

Still,  quests are fun,  there are a lot of good cards, a great new mechanic introduced,  really good effort, about the best we can reasonably expect.

While I have enjoyed this cycle, I admittedly have spent less time with it than probably any of the previous ones.  Through no fault of the game itself, infact I cant think of the state of the game being in a better place especially where its at now and where its going, but have just been enjoying some other hobbies and life of course always getting in the way.  Infact despite owning all the APs I have yet to even attempt the last two quests and those I have played have probably only been just a few attempts each. Maybe once things slow down after the holiday season and we go into a small lull before the next deluxe I'll be able to put in some more time and greater appreciate all the great things we've received this cycle and this year

The main problem is that Loragorn is so much better than him, and that tactics itself offers better alternatives. I guess that Tactigorn works better in multiplayer decks, but in solo mode I only once used him successfully in my last deck (so he is not that bad) against Dread Realm.

 

Just for interest, could you tell me the other heroes of your Scorpio deck? The idea of it sounds great! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Good topic. All my picks, except wellinghall preserver, are from a mutiplayer view.

 

Hero:   Aragorn (aka scorpagorn, great fun to play in multiplayer and say: "get over here!" when you nick a foe from the other end of the table)

Ally:     Wellinghall Preserver (3wp self healing lore ally is just too good to not take this spot)

Att:       Secret Vigil (awesome in multiplayer on 3-4 threat foes)

Event:  Keen as Lances (also great in multi player, when all the players put it in their deck)

SideQ: Gather information (everyone pick a card. nuff said)

 

 

@Leptokurt:

The Scorpagorn deck is built with Aragorn (T) Merry (T) & Pippin (L)

It's mainly a multiplayer deck I think.

The idea is to buff up Merry as much as you can with readying effects like fast hitch & rohan war horse.

Then whenever you kill a foe with merry & aragorn (+any allies needed) you get to ready Aragorn, and pull a foe across the board your way.

Now with all those readying effects you get to ready Merry and you rinse & repeat.

Good stuff.

Oh, and I too like this cycle. More and more so even.

Haven't played all the quests yet, but player card wise it has been a good batch. 

Not every cycle should be like dwarrowdelf in power, and even in there there were a number of coasters.

The ringmaker cycle was great too. This game has become better since Caleb & Matt took over.

IMO the AtS cycle was the worst. The Heirs of Numenor box had some good cards, sure.

But then in AtS the good cards are few and far between packs if you don't use outlands. 

Caleb & Matt's team really have to go and try to beat that cycle for the "worst cycle yet" crown.

another thing I like to do with Aragorn (T) is in multiplayer, having player 1 run Aragorn (T) with whatever, and having player 2 run Haldir of Lorien.  -1 def on enemies makes killing them with haldir's sniper shot easier, and player 2 packing Lore also means you can play Noiseless Movement, further improving Aragorn's Scorpion ability!

## 17 [Noccus on December 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1956386)

Heh, we've played that way. And it works great.

Tip: Legolas & Haldir make a great pair. Access to Rivendell blade, Bow of the Galadhrim & Hands on the bow to name a few.

 

Also, I literally just posted on the deck forum in a deck o mine how good a add Noiseless movement to that deck was.

Funny that you mentioned it just now here too.

I see what you mean, but I'm not sure I agree. I've come to appreciate the less shiny cards, so I quite like the cardpool of AtS. Dwarrowdelf is for me the worst cycle, as it really started power creep in the form of spirit Glorfindel of course, who I never play, as well as Elrond and maybe Aragorn which allows some very powerful combo decks.

Just to help memories back, AtS enabled the Gondor archetype (some good allies, and Visonary Leadership, Strength of Arms), it also marked the start of the Ranger-Trap archetype (two third of the lore cards of this cycle), the Record attachmentd, Caldara, and of course Outlands.

I would not argue though that AtS got the short hand hero-wise: Hirluin and Caldara enable a very particular deck, Faramir his not really good, Mirlonde Pippin and Theoden are niched

## 19 [Noccus on December 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/196739-lost-realmangmar-wrap-up/?do=findComment&comment=1956409)

Less shiny card using is fun, no doubt. 

But if you want to beat the majority of the quests you just can't use a half baked deck.

This means these cards are mostly for a theme or certain quest niche deck.

Which is fine by the way.

 

I understand you defending the AtS cycle, and I'm not saying it just sucks or anything.

To me it is just the worst cycle on player cards to date.

IMO the cycle's Leadership got no interesting cards almost. Just too many outlands to get the gondor trait going.

Spirit really got the shot end of the stick, with maybe 5 widely usable cards.

The lore trap theme got it's cards sure, but it didn't work until Damrod showed up to fix it, as Faramir just plainly went againt it's theme. (what were they thinking!?)

In hindsight tactics got off with the most usable cards over all.

Jumping back to Scorpigorn for a hot second, him and the leadership Faramir hero work really well together.  I feel as though leadership Faramir has gone under the radar a little bit but I've had a lot of success with him especially in a Dunedain-esque build with the handful of options to engage enemies outside the normal engagement step.  So especially once Aragorn drags someone over, Faramir can pop a strong ally back up to attack it.  Simple enough but effective.  (this obviously is best in multi-player when theres enough enemies on the table to justify the combos)

Firstly, I would debate your second point on terminology. A 'half baked deck' to me would mean that the deck is not especially well built rather than making any comment on the quality of the cards used in it. I have a Dwarf deck which I built when I was still very new to the game, thus it's not that well built and I could do much better if I built it now. But I keep it around and use it to play each new quest blind as they hit OCTGN to get a feel for the quest before trying it with other decks. It still beats a lot of quests on the first attempt just because of Dwarves, but it would be one of the first things I'd think of as a 'haf baked deck'.

Secondly, I would also argue that 'less shiny' doesn't necessarily mean worse. Just less in your face "Look how awesome a card I am and acknowledge my greatness!" The vast majority of cards in the game I would say are less shiny than Glorfindel, Light of Valinor and Asfaloth, but that doesn't mean they're inherently worse for beating a given quest. That's actually something I felt when trying to come up with my picks for favourite stuff from this cycle - very few cards really stood out to me as being truly amazing so that I'd immediately throw them on my list, but at the same time I feel like this cycle had a lot of very good cards, they're just mostly less flashy, and/or some of them are only really good in the right kind of deck rather than just being able to just drag and drop into anything you feel like.

(Also, unless you're counting Nightmare, the majority of quests are not so hard that you can't get away with using some less well-favoured cards in your decks in any case)

I'd love to see a multiplayer aragorn/Faramir deck, Pharm, I tried to make Faramir work myself with Veteran of Osgiliath, but it just barely fell flat.

By the way, my opinion on this wrap-up:

 

Hero- Amarthiul: really good hero overall, thematic win and overall great idea to finally get a hero out of an objective ally? How amazing would be a Lord Alcaron Gondor herwo with some kind of doomed ability like Grima? Or a Celador reducing your threat depending on Rangers you control? Or a Nalir?

Ally- Guardian of Arnor, enabling mono-leadership Dunedain.

Attachment- Weather-stain... just kidding. How much I wished this cloak was some kind of defensive capabilities for Rangers of Ithilien. I would go for The Long Defeat, quite a multiplayer card but really powerful. Overall, the cycle was full of good attachments: the helm, the hobbit pony, the silver harp, elf-friend, favor of the valar, etc.

Event- The Door is Closed, the level of power of this card, man

Side Quest- Send for Aid, just for theme

 

Leadership- Guardian of Arnor

Lore- The Door is Closed

Tactics- Horn's Cry

Spirit- Arwen

Neutral- Keen as Lances

 

Quest- The Weather Hills

> I'd love to see a multiplayer aragorn/Faramir deck, Pharm, I tried to make Faramir work myself with Veteran of Osgiliath, but it just barely fell flat.   

Aragorn (tactics) - Faramir (leadership) - Amarthiul

 

Allies:

Dunedain Hunter x3

Weather Hills Watchman x3

Gandalf (core) x3

Defender of Rammas x3

Veteran of Osgiliath x3

Guardian of Arnor x3

Ranger of Cardolan x2

Gimli x2

 

Events:

Valiant Sacrifice x2

Descendants of Kings x3

Sneak Attack x2

Feint x2

 

Attachements:

Secret Vigil x3

Sword that was Broken x2

Dunedain Mark x3

Dunedain Warning x3

Celebrian's Stone x1

Horn of Gondor x1

Captain of Gondor x2

Rohan Warhorse x2

Steward of Gondor x2

 

Everything pretty straightforward here. Havent added anything from Dread Realm yet, Fornost Bowman would prob be the one card from that I'd try to add.  Would be nice to add Treebeard ally to have a huge guy for Faramir to ready too.  Defintely some cuttable items here for other cards.  Horn of Gondor isnt super necessary, Secret Vigil never feel super super useful, Celebrian's stone can probably get cut as well.  Obviously pairs well with a lore/spirit deck for question and healing

This is the first cycle I experienced as an active player and collector and it's been a blast! Lot's of interesting cards that make you rething how to play/build decks (like the Dúnedain and Erestor). Few real coasters. Fun quests, although the story could have been a bit better. Plot wise, the story could have jumped from Dead man's dike to Carn Dum and it would have been ok. Having a recurring boss was fun though.

 

 

Still waiting on the last two quests.

 

Mount Gram was the most dissapointing quest for me. With only 1 hero and no allies, you're left with very few choices as a player. This quest would have benefitted a lot from side-quests at the start, to give players more agency.

 

Weathered Hills was the worst for me, because it felt more like a puzzle than a quest. With the right deck, it's easy, with the wrong deck it's brutal in solo.

 

Wastes of Eriador is probably my favorite because it always feels so relentless, yet beatable. I've never won unsatisfied, which is unusual for this type of game where you can get a 'lucky' draw.

 

 

 

Favorite hero is difficult because I like almost all of them (sorry Dori).

 

Dúnedain hunter is the ally card of the cycle for me, due to it's fun deck-possibilities. 

 

 

> I'm still bummed that Leadership-Tactics Dunedain aggro (aka Secret Defenders) never became a thing in solo

Well, let's make it a deck challenge! Dúnedain in general have been called worthless untill proven otherwise, so tell us what the deckbuilding constraints are for a Leadership-Tactics Dúnedain aggro deck and we'll see who can build a satisfying deck.

I can pinpoint the exact 2 problems that stop the Leadership-Tactics (or Mono Leadership with Amarthiul) Dúnedain deck from being top tier:

 

1: Shadow cancelation. No matter how many defenders you can ready with Descendants of Kings or Strength of Arms, no matter how big you can make your Guardians of Arnor, shadow effects will bite you in the a**. And no, Dúnedain Watcher is not even close to enough. Sacrificing your precious Dúnedain for a 1-shot shadow cancel? Most of the cases it's not worth it.

 

2: Card advantage. After the 4th or 5th round, your hand WILL eventually run out of steam. You'll have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on. You will depend entirely on the topdeck and if you draw a useless Steward or any other unique, it will be hugely detrimental. Dúnedain -hell, Leadership in general- NEEDS some way to draw cards other than King Under the Mountain, or else the deck will depend entirely on the 12 or so cards you get withing the first 5 rounds. And yes, Balin is great for both card draw and shadow cancelation, but I'm sick of running him in all of my Leadership decks.

 

I was eagerly expecting for the Leadership weapon in The Dread Realm to solve one of these problems, but sadly what we got was a totally unnecessary attack boost and an even more useless resource acceleration (and very conditional at that). So, you can make the challenge all you want, but now I'm convinced the designers didn't want to make the deck viable in solo.

D you mean 'top tier' or 'viable' when you say 'became a thing in solo'? Because yeah, Dúnedain is on the level of Gandalf-Vilya, Outlands, Dain dwarf decks etc. It 'top tier' is you meant than I cannot help you. If you want a 'viable' deck, which to me means being able to beat most/all quests in a recent cycle with a good win-rate, than that should be possible and it could be very powerful.

 

But you seem to want to give up before really trying. Which seems to be the prevalent attitude to the Dúnedain on these boards. Before Seastans video's showing him win against Into Ithilien Nightmare, everyone was convinced Dúnedain couldn't work, period. So if Seastan already showed that a trap-Dúnedian deck is very good and that a non-trap Dúnedain deck is very good, why not see if he or anyone else can make a non-lore Dúnedain deck very good?

Without even really trying, you say? Did you see my mono Leadership Dunedain deck? It was also one of the first posted. Also, i am totally aware of Seastan's deck, and it's really good, but it's not what I personally wanted the Dunedain to be the most. It's a combo deck and runs Lore (which I'm not against thematically or anything like that.) I just really wanted the Leadership-Tactics (or mono with Amarthiul) deck to be really good, as aggro and L-T is my favorite deck style and fave sphere combo. Ad it just feels great for the Dunedain in flavor. That's the thing though, it's just my personal expectation and the designers are not bound to it. Same happened for me with HoN.

I didn't want to sound so negative, you could maybe build a deck and prove me wrong, but I have actually tried and it' nigh impossible to make such a deck and make it effective against the current meta without Balin, not only Angmar Awakened but current saga as well. In fact, that's precisely why the deck I posted as my vision of the definitive most powerful Leadership-Tactics aggro deck runs Balin, as he gives you access to the best shadow cancelation and card draw in Leadership and Tactics. And I still believe it's probably the best deck you could make with those spheres without relying on very specific card combos, as Seastan's decks often do. (It's just not my playstyle and don't particularly enjoy it, plus it's much harder to pull off without Lore).

 

I also want to add, there are other Leadership Tacctics decks that are really good in solo (albeit not as good) such as Core Aragorn Imrahil and Eomer, and of course Elladan and Elrohir (which will be even better with Arwen and Elvish Light.) But sadly, Aragorn (either version except for Lore), Amarthiul and Halbarad are not one of them.

 

 

Total divergence incoming:

 

Actually, now that I think of it, Lore Aragorn, Halbarad and Amarhiul can be a very strong aggro deck in general, with card draw, and access to Burning Brand. You give Steward to Aragorn so you can play Snares and Sentries, Brand, etc. You then get the Sword that was Broken so he can pay for Leadership cards. But since you're still running 2 Leadership heroes and with Good Harvest, you can still play for the other Leadership stuff easily. So then Aragorn gets Brand and Shield while Amarthiul can have Dunedain Warning x3 (easy to get with card draw and Weather Hills Watchman). So then you have two pretty powerful defenders (thought not the best), or you could attach  Song of Wisdom on Amarthiul to give him Brand. I'll definately have to try it.

I was kind of expecting one of those points to be willpower. I seem to recall someone, possibly you, being annoyed that Amarthiul was only 1 willpower because it continued to pigeonhole this kind of Dunedain deck into a combat focus rather than being more generalised and thus solo-viable. On the other hand of course, having Leadership and Aragorn means Sword that was Broken and Faramir, so long as the deck can survive long enough to get them out.

Shadow cancellation is an issue to be sure, but Leadership has card draw other then KUtM. Sneak Attack Gandalf and Valiant Sacrifice have been around since the Core Set and their still good. I recall for a mono-Leadership Dunedain deck Seastan suggested Lord of Morthond with Tactics allies as a possibility. For Dunedain more generally, if you have Tactics you can use Legolas and Foe-hammer. The card draw is fine.

 

Personally, I imagine a lack of shadow cancellation may make such a deck inconsistent, but the shortage of starting willpower is what I would expect to be the biggest obstacle to making it work at all (though if one is willing to stretch the theme a bit that could help, with e.g. Sam).

Lack of willpower was one of my main problems with it, but after plating it extensively it's not really that much of a problem. With the cards you mentioned and Galadriel as well as Celebrían's Stone, which is actually an excellent card, you can get very decent willpower without much trouble. I still agree with that getting a Gondor or Dúnedain Leadership hero with lowish threat and 2 or 3 willpower would be extremely nice, but that's more for Gondor than Dúnedain, as Halbarad fills the role nicely. With Gondor you need to either run Balin or Sam, or go full Valour with Imrahil. However, I still think card draw in those spheres is lacking. While Foe-Hammer and Sneak Attack are both good (they're both 2 card combos that draw you 3 cards) even 2 card combos are a bit hard to use in these sphere, and they're not nearly as reliable as repeatable card draw like KUTM or single-card-card-draw like Daeron's Runes or Deep Knowledge.

Why is it a combo deck? If Damrod+Forest snare counts as a combo, you should see my other decks...  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Mono-leadership Aragorn Halbarad and Amarthiul can absolutely be made into a top tier deck, but you might declare one of the cards I use to be a combo and invalidate  it. But regardless, picking three specific heroes and demanding that they be made into a top tier deck, and then being heavily critical of the entire trait when it doesn't work out comes across as a little whiny to me.

As I said, it's just my personal expectation, and it absolutely doens't have to be what the designers intended. So I have no problem admitting it's a bit whiny.

 

To me there's something different between an aggro deck that makes most use of the resource curve to play whatever it can to advance its board state, and a combo deck that heavily relies on one card to make all the difference. I guess you can say every deck is a combo dekc in that they need one or two cards to ge going, such as Steward of Gondor to play all your weenies, but that's the case with all spheres, and once you get Steward anything you play will advance more or less equally your board state. On the other hand with your deck if you never get Forest Snare you are in big trouble. A good comparison is that in your deck you run 5 Spirit allies, which in an aggro deck it probably wouldn't happen.

While I agree a generic name would have been better, they could create additional "Ranger in the North" cards.  They don't effect our 3x limit since they aren't included in our deck build and the event could be used to grab whatever version you want.

Delayed answer, but I was traveling and hate posting on my phone...

 

Favorites:

Hero - Aragorn with honorable mention to Erestor.  Both of these guys open up totally new deck styles. 

Ally - Dunedain Hunter with honorable mention to Ranger of the North for breaking the mold.

Attachment - Secret Vigil

Event - Ranger Summons

Side Quest - Send for Aid

 

Looking back, I find myself a little disappointed by this cycle.  I would rank it my 3rd favorite behind Dwarrowdelf and Ringmaker.  So many of the player cards from this cycle feel underdeveloped.  Valour and Dunedain are awesome concepts, but there aren't enough tools to make them hum yet.  I feel like the Valour cards are generally overcosted.  They are mostly bad outside of Valour and only decent with Valour.  The Dunedain mechanic requires you to be engaged with many enemies, but they don't have repeatable ways to avoid nasty shadow cards that will inevitably hurt you as much as the attackers themselves.  They mostly have to rely on Forest Snare to make it work.  I'm also not too excited about the new Noldor discard mechanic.  It relies too heavily on Erestor for the card draw.  I suspect Erestor will be the most played hero of 2016 and everyone will be fighting over who gets to use him.

 

I do like the victory display mechanic, although it seems to take too long to get going.  I wish there was one more threat reduction card in lore that would make a mono-lore secrecy deck sustainable since Out of the Wild it one of the few victory display cards that is useful from turn 1.  Also, Rossiel's interaction with the victory display is a little weak. 

 

I'm not into player side quests.  Maybe it's just that I've been playing the new cycle and it seems like there are always encounter side quests flooding the board, but spending a turn (or more) on a player side quest rarely seems worth it.  The only times I've seen much benefit from the side quests are when we are trying to avoid a keyword like battle or siege, but that just feels like cheesing the quests.  However, I think encounter side quests are great.  They add another crucial decision point that is often more interesting than traveling.

 

Looking at the quests, I don't see many that I expect I will come back to often.  Wastes of Eriador and Carn Dum have awesome mechanics, but they are near impossible to beat, especially in multiplayer.  The Thaudir/undead theme is really cool, but they went back to that well one or two too many times.  I love the idea of Mount Gram, but it's just too easy of a quest.  I was also excited about Across the Ettenmoors, but it just fell a bit flat.  IMO, the only top tier quest of the cycle was Treachery of Rhudaur.  I really like the 5 turn timer to the boss fight and how the three side quests work.  The choice of side quests can dramatically change the game.

 

All in all, I think the quality of the game is still trending upward.  Most of my comments were negative, but it was by no means a bad cycle.  Dwarrowdelf is still the high water mark, but Ringmaker was great and Angmar Awakens was still very good.  Against the Shadow remains by far my least favorite.  The next cycle looks amazing and I can't wait to dive into it!

Good points, Teamjimby. I agree with many of your assessments that some of the new player card concepts introduced in this cycle are really cool, but need another card or two to feel fully developed.

A few of your points don't match my personal experience, though, so I came through this cycle with a much more positive outlook on the player cards:

 

> The Dunedain mechanic requires you to be engaged with many enemies, but they don't have repeatable ways to avoid nasty shadow cards that will inevitably hurt you as much as the attackers themselves.  They mostly have to rely on Forest Snare to make it work.

I have heard this criticism of Dunedain before, but I haven't run into it in practice. I've typically been perfectly happy to discard the Dunedain Watcher for any attack that would kill a hero--and that has usually been enough. Granted, I haven't played a Dunedain deck through the entire Angmar Awakened cycle (I ran them through Land of Shadow, the first five quests of Lost Realm + Angmar Awakened, and a few random nightmare decks from Mirkwood and Dwarrodelf) so maybe Angmar Awakened has overall worse shadows than other quests.

 

That being said, if you want more shadow control, there are options other than Dunedain Watcher. Loragorn, Beravor, Ring of Barahir, or Song of Wisdom all grant access to Burning Brand. Idraen or Celebrian's Stone grant access to Hasty Stroke. Tireless Hunters is pretty much made for Dunedain. You could even try sticking Dark Knowledge on Amarthiul to help you know when you can risk a weaker defender.

 

I'd love to see a Dunedain hero that has some repeatable way to discard shadow cards, but I'm not sure it's required before we can declare Dunedain to be viable.
 

> I'm also not too excited about the new Noldor discard mechanic.  It relies too heavily on Erestor for the card draw.  I suspect Erestor will be the most played hero of 2016 and everyone will be fighting over who gets to use him.

My wife and I have built quite a few Noldor discard decks lately, and only one of them has had Erestor in it. Galadriel, Arwen + Elven Light, or a Lore hero can all provide the card draw needed to power the discard stuff, so Erestor is not always required!

 

I've been really enjoying Noldor decks recently--I can't wait to see what new toys we get in the Grey Havens box.
 

> I'm not into player side quests. Maybe it's just that I've been playing the new cycle and it seems like there are always encounter side quests flooding the board, but spending a turn (or more) on a player side quest rarely seems worth it. The only times I've seen much benefit from the side quests are when we are trying to avoid a keyword like battle or siege, but that just feels like cheesing the quests.

It's super weird that they introduced player side quests in the same cycle that typically punishes having multiple quests in play. As I play through Angmar Awakened, I keep including side quests in my deck and then cutting them on the second playthrough because I don't want to get punished for putting them down.

 

I've really enjoyed using them in other quests, though--especially using Gather Information in place of a third copy of a unique card.

 

So anyway, that's my two cents!

Those are some good points about Dunedain.  I just feel like they generally need to be engaged with 3+ enemies during combat (and 2+ during planning) to make their allies, Amarthiul, and Heir of Valandil worthwhile.  Maybe Burning Brand or shadow cancellation can stop 1 or 2, but to get the full effect you need serious shenanigans like Forest Snare, Thicket of Spears, or multiple Unexpected Courages to go with Burning Brand.

 

I think the problem with Dunedain, Valour, and Noldor (at least for now) is the size of the card pool.  It's impossible to flesh out a whole new deck archtype in one cycle and have it compete with the existing archtypes unless they make the new cards very powerful.  But that would then lead to power creep and have other issues.  So, I'm not sure what else they could do.  Maybe if they made the whole cycle focused on a single archtype they could do it, but that's unhealthy for the game as well.

I mostly agree with you Teamjimby, however, there are tons of ways to make new cards "compete" without being overpowered. My favorite example is Deep Knowledge, a completely valid alternative for Daeron's Runes in any deck that won't mind the threat increase. There are many potential alternatives like these for the Dúnedain, Noldor or any archetype they want to develop. It may be not as straightforward as a Rivendell Blade, but they should have a minor drawback to balance it out.

> I didn't want to sound so negative, you could maybe build a deck and prove me wrong, but I have actually tried and it' nigh impossible to make such a deck and make it effective against the current meta without Balin, not only Angmar Awakened but current saga as well. In fact, that's precisely why the deck I posted as my vision of the definitive most powerful Leadership-Tactics aggro deck runs Balin, as he gives you access to the best shadow cancelation and card draw in Leadership and Tactics. And I still believe it's probably the best deck you could make with those spheres without relying on very specific card combos, as Seastan's decks often do. (It's just not my playstyle and don't particularly enjoy it, plus it's much harder to pull off without Lore).

 

You did sound a bit defeatist, even though you made a really cool Leadership Dúnedain deck! I don't agree you 'need' shadow cancellation in solo except for a few specific quests (probably Carn Dum in this cycle). The Dúnedain deck I ran against this cycle doesn't include Burning Brand or Dúnedain Watcher and in my last run of consecutive quests I won IoC, TWH, DD, EfMG and AtE all in my first try. Went 3-3 against Wastes of Eriador. To me, that's what I call 'viable'. 

 

Maybe you've grown a little too dependant on Balin for your playstyle? And while you are free to want to stick with a Balinesque playstyle and hope for more leadership alternatives, it might be an idea to try to learn to play around shadow cards against.

 

My Denethor-Palantir-Rossiel deck, now that's 'Not Viable'! I spend 10 turns manipulating the encounterdeck to my exact liking, didn't have anything to actually WIN the game once I got setup.

 

Now that I have all packs I'll definately want to try an Aragorn(T) Halbarad Amarthiúl deck out.

 

> I'm also not too excited about the new Noldor discard mechanic.  It relies too heavily on Erestor for the card draw. 
> 
>  

 

Have you tried Elven Light? Suddenly all Noldor powerups require half a resource instead of discarding. I haven't tried a Noldor deck before, but I assume it would work really well with all the support it's gotten now.

 

 

 

All in all, I'm really glad that looking back at the cycle, we get all these discussions about wether Dúnedain decks or Noldor decks can work and how they should work. For me, the Silvan deck was a little bit too 'designed' by the creators as was Outlands in the cycle before that. IMO Seastan build the 'best' Dúnedain deck, while FFG build the 'best' Silvan deck. Here's hoping the next cycle will challenge our solution finding skills even more.

I agree that the Silvan deck felt railroaded and I like the Dunedain open-endedness better.  Although I'm glad they are continuing to add more Silvan cards, so we will have more room to deckbuild with Silvans.

I really liked The Weathered Hills quest

Amarthiul hero.

Overall I think this cycle was OK had a lot of steam from the start. I really liked the deluxe box quests. The last two quests from this cycle were just so brutal. I really enjoy a challenge but I feel you really really need to hone your decks to be able to beat the quests on regular mode. I kind of wish they saved it more for NM mode. But I still really enjoyed the quests and trying to figure them out.

My only real complaint is I feel like the quests are becoming very long. Many times I have to reset after a few rounds. Sometimes I make it to mid game and have to reset. But I can't string play as many games cuz the quests feel like slog fests. So many cards surge which makes staging take longer, the enemies are difficult to one round so combat takes longer and now the side quests that come from the encounter deck are almost always must-do or youll get nasty effects

Still loving the game though and will continue to buy everything that comes out! Lol I'm a slave to this game

Edit: I guess I should say that I play 2handed solo with physical cards not on OCTGN so the setup and tear down takes a bit longer when you have to reset often

If only the Galadrim Minstrel wasn't so superior to most other Silvan's 'come into play' effect, they might also have been more fun to play. But improving the options for Silvan is going to be difficult as we're unlikely to get heroes superior to Galadriel+Celeborn or allies superior to the Minstrel. Not impossible, but I don't think Silvan's are going to be my favorite trait any time soon.

I dunno,  I sort of disagree.  I don't use Celeborn in my silvan deck.   I use Galadriel/Haldir/Glorfindel (but I'm switching in Arwen when I get  her -probably tomorrow!), I don't use the minstrel.  My deck seems to do pretty ok, so I don't think it's railroaded as you suggest.   It's one way to build a deck, sure, but there are others.  I don't rely on silvan "comes into play" effects,  I just run good cards.

I enjoy deckbuilding and do plenty of it, but I don't mind going in with a ready-made deck either.  Sentinels of the Multiverse is a great game, very similar to LotR but no deckbuilding aspect.  Still fun.

 

The Silvan deck really does build itself (even if you go crazy and omit Celeborn, you still follow the same formula: Silvan allies, Silvan-theme events).  It's fun to play, and that counts for a lot!  I have never tried Outlands, which is another deck that builds itself.... doesn't really seem like a fun archetype. Silvans on the other hand bring rich gameplay to the table and are one of my favorites.

Trying to steer the conversation away from Silvan back to the wrapup. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I liked the story part they where going for. Iarion's inclusion in two quests made me care more for him. Every storytelling fibre of my being knew that Amarthiul's mentor would not survive so I wasn't motivated to rescue him. I liked Amarthiul too. He started out pretty bland, but after saving you in the various quests, I grew fond of him. His stats tell us his personality (it's risky to block with him but you do so anyway). Having him as a hero made me happy, so we can have him travel with us in new adventures.

 

Thaurdir was a great enemy. Starts out story wise with an ambush, and as an enemy card, he is pretty relentless. Having him return in three quests also made me look foreward to finally beating him. Winning Carn Dum was therefore one of my favorite moments in the game, because it's such a well deserved victory over an enemy I was looking foreward to defeating for a long time! Daechanar on the other hand was a bit anti-climactic after dealing with Thaurdir. We get little buildup for his character so he just shows up and we kill him. Didn't help that I got really lucky in my first try and easily beat the quest.

 

I would like to see more emphasis on 'new' characters with continuation. Wouldn't it have been cool if Muglash was an enemy in the battle of Helms deep? I hope we get more characters heroes and villains both, we get emotionally invested in who play a role in the FFG LotR canon.

No matter how many defenders you can ready with Descendants of Kings or Strength of Arms, no matter how big you can make your Guardians of Arnor, shadow effects will bite you in the a**. And no, Dúnedain Watcher is not even close to enough. Sacrificing your precious Dúnedain for a 1-shot shadow cancel? Most of the cases it's not worth it.
> 
>  
> 
> 2: Card advantage. After the 4th or 5th round, your hand WILL eventually run out of steam. You'll have tons of resources and nothing to spend them on. You will depend entirely on the topdeck and if you draw a useless Steward or any other unique, it will be hugely detrimental. Dúnedain -hell, Leadership in general- NEEDS some way to draw cards other than King Under the Mountain, or else the deck will depend entirely on the 12 or so cards you get withing the first 5 rounds. And yes, Balin is great for both card draw and shadow cancelation, but I'm sick of running him in all of my Leadership decks.

 

I've been experimenting with a Halbarad, Aragorn(T) Amarthiúl deck. It's not where I want it to be yet, but I remembered your comments and found them very relatable. My first version ran out of steam quick and got smashed by some nasty shadows. But I've been having some succes in dealing with this.

 

For card draw I use Sneak-Attack-Gandalf-on-steroids

3 x Sneak Attack

3 x Reinforcements

3 x Gandalf (core)

3 x Sarn Ford Sentry

 

Since the point of the Dúnedain deck is to keep several weaker enemies around, Sarn Ford Sentry often works just as well as Gandalf for card draw. This makes the combo much more reliable than just with Gandalf. I also use Erestor (for the uniques and if desperate for combo pieces) and Rallying Cry. The last one let's you use Gandalf again for tons of resources, but it also let's you sneak attack Sarn Ford Sentry AND let her die to blocking whithout losing your combo piece. I've also used it to keep Dúnedain Watcher around after using her ability. Once you hit Valour, Rallying Cry adds a lot of value for a single card, helping you keep up with the encounter deck without losing the card-advantage game. (Between Steward of Gondor and Amarthiúl I feel confident enough in my resouce gathering to replay lost allies that get returned to hand.)

 

Landrovel (another good Reinfocements candidate) and Honor guard also help deal with unexpected shadow cards that kill heroes. Should I get my deck where I want it to be, I'll post it in the strategy section. I do feel some of these cards can help your mono-leadership Dúnedain deck as well get more where you want it to be.

I am looking at the above top 10 of sorts and nodding with agreement. Well, I don't really like side quests but then there is one choice I totally do not get. I find Steed of Imladris very subpar actually. Please, tell me, is it just a thematic/art choice, or does it actually work well in some quests?

It works great with the whole Erestor thing going. By discarding a card, you can either help yourself get out of location lock or just place two more progress on the current quest than you usually would.

I know the theory behind it, yes, but how does it actually work in practice? I have never used it, which is why I am asking. And I haven't used it because I always use Protector of Lórien in an Erestor deck, and this card just seems so inferior to it: the need for a location, being restricted, not versatile. Is the potential one extra progress worth its inclusion?

Why is that an either/or situation? With the right support (Galdor, Silver Harp etc.) you can easily utilise both Protector of Lorien and Steed(s) of Imladris.

Honestly I picked Steed of Imladris not because I find it super good, but instead because I think is the least "meh" attachment of the cycle (I found the attachments to be somewhat lacking). Anyways, note that the ability of Steed of Imladris isn't limited to once per phase/round.

 

I'm wondering now if you can use the ability beyond the "HP" of a location and put the remaining tokens on the current quest; for example, let's say the active location has only 1 "HP" remaining, and you discard five cards... would that mean that 9 tokens would go onto the current quest?

First, please do not think I am a trouble-maker here, I like to hear arguments. Still, my experience with an Erestor deck is not exactly one of having too many cards on my hand (except round 1, and even that not always). But I will believe you if your experience is otherwise.

 

As for using the effect more than once, I am not sure but I think you are not allowed to discard more than 1 card since it is not an action, rather a response. I even seem to remember this being discussed when the card appeared but I am not entirely sure. I also do not think if there is just 1 progress on the location left that the other token would spill over to the quest.

Yeah, Steed of Imladris would be limited to once per instance that the attached hero commits to the quest.  So, once per round in all but a few unusual situations.  You can only activate the Response once per trigger (otherwise you could, say, use one copy of Mighty Prowess to kill all enemies on the table in a single go).

Compared to Protector you're sacrificing a card for 2 progress instead of only 1 and can potentially remove active location effects before the quest phase resolves. And you'll still make progress even if you don't win the phase.
