I mean: what is the 'object?' in the back of the guy? it seems a cross, or a barret..., anyone knows what is it?

I always assumed it is a bird, but having looked a bit closer now it does not seem like it is. And it would be rather silly.

Yea, its a little hard to see but the part going down is a shield. That confused me for a while too.

I always saw the picture as a whole as Aragorn or someone standing atop Amon Hen, before the Uruk Hai slay Boromir.

I think it's two items: he's holding a shield and then there's some cape blowing off of his shoulder...

I can't see it as a cape no matter how hard I look. To me its a dark cloud.
