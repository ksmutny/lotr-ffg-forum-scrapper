 Hi im new to the game and when playing 2 questions arose:

1) if you use sneak attack with gandalf, does his effect still take place? (and i know he only stays in play for 1 phase)

2) can an attachment be attached to a character of a different sphere of influence even though i paid for it with the correct sphere of influence (for example if I used gimli's pool to pay for dwarven axe, can i attach it to aragorn?
 

thanks

 Yes to both questions.

 An attachment or event card will say in its text if it has any restrictions on whom it can be played eg hero only or sphere X only. So the general rule is unless it says a restriction on the card then there aren't any.

An example of this would be "A Burning Brand" which can only be attached to a Lore character. The workaround for this is to play Song of Wisdom (only on heroes though) which gives the attached hero a Lore resource icon, thus making the hero belong to the Lore sphere and therefore elligible to have A burning Brand attached.

 Oh ok thanks for the clarification. When playing 2 player, can you attach one of your attachment cards to your teammate's character?

Yes, you can attach to any eligible character, regardless of owner.
