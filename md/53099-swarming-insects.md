I not sure to understand this card :

If a character (including Wilyador) has more damage than each other character, deal 3 additional damage to that character.

Must I deal 3 damage if :

a) Wilyador have damages more than the total of others characters

b) Wilyador have more damages than other characters

 Find which character has the most damage.  Deal 3 damage to that character.  If two characters are tied for most damage, then no one takes damage.

I believe radiskull is indeed correct. If two players are tied for damange, the cards "if" clause would not be satisfied since no one character has more damage than any other character.

Indeed, this was exactly my reasoning.  Why phrase it as an if-then if it's always going to damage someone?
