Hi guys, 

If I travel to the Tower Gate location and Iron Shackes is on top of my deck do I put Iron Shackles face down as the Orc Guard? or is that card discarded and a new card is placed as the Orc guard?

Regards

If i recall right, iron shackles never actually goes on top of your deck.  It 'Attaches to the top of your deck', which means that, regardless of anything else that happens to the top card of your deck, it stays there.  Discard the top card?  Iron shackles is still attached to the top of your deck.

It’s important to note that Iron Shackles is attached to the top of your deck, not the top card of your deck.
