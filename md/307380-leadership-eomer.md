Can leadership Eomer's ability (and other cards like it, like Battle Fury) be used to attack immune to player card effects enemies? I can't figure out whether this counts as a normal attack or a "player card effect"

No, Eomer (and other cards) still target the enemy so they can't choose immune enemies in the staging area.

Also from FAQ 1.9

Q: Are there any player cards that allow me to attack an enemy in the staging area if it is immune to player card effects?
A: No. None.
