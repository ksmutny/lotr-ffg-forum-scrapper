This is my all time favorite quest so I had to join in. Played Gandalf, Treebeard and Glorfindel.

Final score 95.

Did the other one as well: Sam, Pippin and Merry Final score 85.

I'm about to perform dat challenge myself, but I'm writing for some other reason:

 

Just had an idea of a "big roller" challenge. Win with a 100-card deck :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

## 5 [Seastan on August 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1744374)

Why stop at 100? Win any quest with a deck made of every card in your collection.

## 6 [Teamjimby on August 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1744381)

This would be hard to track, but I'd love to do something like win with a deck made only of cards you haven't used in the last 6 months.

That really wouldn't work for me, because I'm pretty sure at any given moment I've probably used every single hero at some point in the last 6 months except for newly released ones. So I guess if we did it right now I could try to build a deck with Faramir/Damrod/Rossiel, but they probably won't remain unused for too long...

Really?  You've used Brand, Bard, Fatty, Dwalin, Oin, Spirit Pippin, and Bombur in the last 6 months?  In that case maybe you would have to use your bottom 1/2 or 1/3 of most played heroes. 

## 9 [PocketWraith on August 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1744582)

6 months is a long time in which many different decks can be played.

## 10 [John Constantine on August 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1744605)

Brand, Fatty, Oin and Bombur are decent heroes that can be utilized well.

## 11 [Dwarf king Bronze beard on August 19, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1744629)

Here is how my challenge went:


 


Heroes: Idraen, Glorfindel, Haldir of Lorien


Threat: 29


Rounds: 6


Victory points: 0


Score: 89


 


Game shortly: Again Zigil Miner deck with some ranger spikes and other lore stuff spiced with some doomed cards. So nothing really interesting happened. I trapped two enemies with ranger spikes. Killed one Southorn Company and quested hard. I might try to do lower score but it will be difficult...


 


I also would love that next challenge would be that "Big roller" thing what Constantine suggested. What about Journey Along the Anduin for the quest? It would be pretty nice choice i think.

The "big roller" challenge sounds fun. One of my favorite formats in Magic: The Gathering is Highlander where you have 100 cards and can have no more than 1 copy of each card. We might not have enough player cards to pull that off (~400 based on a recent post's count), though.

 

I should get to this week's challenge tomorrow. Just finished a big exam today.

## 15 [John Constantine on August 20, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1745430)

By the way, reporting from the fields, I'm facing 5th defeat in a row and keep counting :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I decided to do something unorthodox and my hero setup is: Faramir, Glorfindel, and Denethor - all lore. I'm simply getting swarmed every time by drawing enemies exclusively.

## 16 [John Constantine on August 20, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1745473)

Lost one more time and decided to re-make my deck. This time I used Elrond(no ring in the deck!), Glorfindel and Haldir, and won on my second try with final score of 146 :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

## 17 [entMoot on August 21, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1746861)

I went for a tried and true trio of Gandalf, Glorfindel (Spirit) and Elrond against Into Ithilien. I tried to avoid combat for the most part, though eventually one Company and one Mercs each slipped by my Saruman and Ranger Spikes.

 

After landing Vilya early on I was able to set up with Unexpected Courage, Snowmane and Light of Valinor so that my heroes were always at the ready. Treebeard and a few ents rounded out my questing prowess while I ditched some spare uniques to Flame of Anor and Elvish Jeweler.

 

Rounds completed: 5

Threat: 43

Damage: 7

VP: 1 (Flame of Anor)

Score: 99

 

I'd also like to say it was nice to have the Cloak of Loriens on Glorfindel and Elrond help with the final Siege push on 4B, though most of the characters I had in play were 2+ defense without any help.

 

Thanks for the excuse to revisit this quest!

I decided to try a thematic mono-Lore Ranger Trap deck for this one: Faramir (L) / Damrod / Pippin (L). It worked really well! I was blown away by how awesome Lore Faramir is for Battle quests--every time an enemy comes out of the encounter deck, he quests for more! Throw in Wingfoot, and then he can make use of that massive attack value for attacking too.

 

Henamarth turned out to be really clutch too--knowing exactly what's coming helps to prepare for Blocking Wargs and make sure I'm questing with enough characters.

 

9 Rounds

40 threat

0 Damage

0 Victory Points

Score 130

I hope I can write  more challenges:

 

Shadow of the Past:Win without failing any Hide test.

 

A Knife in the Dark:Win either with all Ringwraiths shuffled in the encounter deck before stage 3 or with no Ringwraith in the encounter deck.

 

Flight to the Ford:Win with  Ring-bearer having  at least 5 life reamaining.

August 2015 Challenge #2 - 

Glorfindel (Spirit), Idraen, Damrod

Normal mode-victory, score = 109

Nightmare mode - victory score = 154

 

Was a fun challenge, made use out of Damrod for the 1st time who was great.  My resources were a little unbalanced when comparing how many lore cards i was running with only one Lore hero, but his ability helped smooth things out a little bit by lowering the cost of the traps i ran which were ranger spikes, ithilien pit (fantastic card for stage 3 to keep things from piling up), and ranger spikes.  Had a lot of action advantage as well between light of valinor, Idraen's ability, and wingfoot on Damrod.  Getting past stage 1 was really the hardest part as I could generally camp on stage 3 until I was set up enough to pass stage 4 in one turn or two and there was enough location and enemy manipulation to keep things smooth.

Thanks for all the responses! 

Sorry I haven't been responding to all of you guys, I've just been swamped with work.  Anyway, my plan was to have two every month.  This is the second one for the month, so the next one would be at the beginning of September.  Would you guys like me to change that? I'm just going off of what others said they wanted.

I first played this with Elrond, Gandalf, and Glorfindel.  It was the first and last time I will ever use that deck.  Beat it on the first try with a score around 120.

 

Then I played with Glorfindel, Idraen, and Haldir.  Haldir plus Idraen with Ranger Bow were able to snipe all of the enemies without ever engaging.  I got doomed 3 twice, which meant stage 4 was siege, so it took me a couple rounds to get through that.  Final score was 112.

## 29 [Authraw on August 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1756026)

Sorta funny that the All-Stars didn't do as well as the other deck. High starting threat, I guess?

Played Faramir, Damrod and Mirlonde in NM mode. Score was 114.

Damrod and the traps are great now.

Could you please provide a decklist?

It probably would have averaged a better score, but anything can happen in one game depending on how the encounter deck goes.

I was trying to decide if I should post my attempt or not as many might consider it a little cheap. But now that the challenge is over I'll provide a link to the video for those who are curious.

 

Heroes: Aragorn/Mirlonde/Beravor and Pippin/Bilbo/Haldir

Sorry about that. I'm still trying to figure out the optimal way to record 2-handed.

 

Did you try waiting a few seconds for the HD to kick in? Sometimes it takes a minute. And every time I mouse over a card you can see the zoomed in version.

## 38 [John Constantine on August 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1757288)

With HD on I can only make out your hand, sorry, the table is obscure. Maybe its just my sight, though.

## 39 [Seastan on August 26, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1757350)

Don't worry about it, it wasn't that exciting to watch anyway. Next time I make a two-handed video I will try to make it clearer.

 

I'll give a short summary:

The two decks play a bunch of doomed cards to draw and build up resources.

Each deck plays 3 copies of Ravens of the Mountains and 3 copies of Scroll of Isildur to recycle them.

Using Ravens of the Mountains I progress through stage 1 during the planning phase and advance to stage 3. There are 6 fast hitches in play to provide the necessary readying for this.

Then during the quest phase I use Gildor's counsel and my knowledge of the top card to just barely fall short of completing stage 3. The reason for this is that stage 3 says enemies do not make engagement checks, so I won't have to worry about defending and possibly taking damage.

Then during the refresh phase, after everyone is readied, I cycle through more Ravens of the Mountains to complete stage 3 and 4.

I also reset threat for both players using Aragorn+Desperate Alliance, and lower both players threat to 0 using multiple copies of Galadhrim's Greetings to finish with 0 score.

## 40 [narubianHorror293 on August 29, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185361-bi-monthly-challenge-2/?do=findComment&comment=1761565)

Hey. I hope this isn't considered thread resurrection, given that challenge #3 is already up.

 

I felt like building a mono-Lore Gondor ranger trap deck, with the new Damrod hero and some new related cards. Lost twice very early, and won on my third try in a long and very controlled game.

 

Heroes:  Damrod, Faramir, Denethor

I think I got Henamarth Riversong in my opening hand or the first/second turn, and since then he scried the top card of the encounter deck each turn, helping me plan my turn and prepare for dealing with that single card. If I saw Blocking Wargs, Denethor immediately exhausted to send them to the bottom of the deck.

 

I got two Mithrandir's Advice pretty quickly, one in my opening hand, which helped me with some cards; Burning Brand and a first Protector of Lorien came up pretty quickly and landed on Denethor, and Wingfoot went on Faramir after 5-7 turns, which with Henemarth meant he both quested for 4 (in the first, Battle, quest phase, which took all but the last 4 or 5 turns of the game) and then readied to be available for attacking. A first Master of the Forge also came up in the first few turns, and I think then died to a Haradrim Elite - my only character casualty - after two great uses; a second one immediately followed, so that alone gave me an extra card each turn (26 attachments means I never misfired with this).

 

I tricked one Ithilien Archer and one Ithilien Lookout with my Elfstones, which was cool. And I kept landing Ranger Spikes on the 25 (or 27?) threat spiders, which was important, and on one Soutron Company. So I basically took a single enemy each time I could afford not sending Damrod to quest, and then he and Wingfooted-Faramir killed that single dude. Got one use of Ambush, which was good.

 

Expert Treasure Hunter came around about 10 turns before game end or so, and saying "attachment" each time I only misfired once or twice. Together with Damrod netting me a card each time a trap attached, and the aforementioned Mithrandir's Advice X 2 and Master of the Forge, I had a lot of cards in my hand at all times. I'm glad I went with 56 cards, as I got down to at least 15, if not less, by the end of the game. And they were put to good use too - the first Protector of Lorien on Denethor allowed me to discard a card or two to defend precisely, and the second one went on Faramir a short time before finishing quest stage one, which helped me quest quickly in the following stage 3 (Celador lived) and than in the siege-ish stage 4 (discard the full 3 for each of Denethor and Faramir to power quest through it).

 

Other cards that played their part:

 * Anborn was only there for the last quarter of the game, perhaps, but he got me the crucial Ranger Spikes back again and again to keep everything in the staging area, and with a low threat.
 * Ithilien Tracker canceled the Mumak, and a couple other things. Also, he had a...
 * Ranger Bow, with was used more than a few times together with...
 * Forest Patrol to get one Southron Company and either one or two spiders, while at the staging area.
 * Ambush. Only used it once, to kill Haradrim Elite before their second, non-forced attack, but I liked it.

Cards that I ended up not using, and I might take out in future versions of this deck:

 * Deep Knowledge - Usually I couldn't risk the threat. When I could, I had more than enough cards.
 * Expert Trackers  - Used once, I think to get two progress on a location (not sure). Could be nice with the Mumak, but generally most locations were discarded as shadows in this play-through.
 * Mablung (ally) - Actually played him and didn't use his ability.
 * Ithilien Pit & Forest Snare & Poisoned Spikes - Didn't use the first two, the third only once, maybe. I'd say Ranger Spikes and Ambush are more important to this deck. But their synergy with numerous cards in this deck should keep some of those in there. 

I didn't get to use Warden of Healing, White Tower Watchman, Quickbeam and Envoy of Pelargir, which were there for resource smoothing (as the other allies are quite expensive), but it ended up OK. Not sure about them. The ally rangers are a little more important here, but Quickbeam will stay because he's so good, and WTW for defending when Denethor uses his ability before questing. The others may go.

 

Absolute stars: All heroes. Ranger Spikes X 100. Wingfoot. Protector of Lorien. Burning Brand. Advice. Master of the Forge. Henamarth.

Also nice: Ranger Bow. Ambush. Forest Patrol. Ithilien Tracker 

 

All in all, I really enjoyed playing with this deck. I wanna try taking on some other quests with it.

How about a "lesser self" challenge, where you have to use alternate versions of commonly played heroes? Specifically, I'm thinking the requirement would be Lore Glorfindel, Spirit Pippin, and Tactics Theoden. Would be fun to try against something like The Massing at Osgiliath.

Have anybody here played digital versions of MtG? Each intallment featured so called "challenges" where player was faced with a certain situation in game and was forced to solve it within 1-2 turns. I wonder if something like this is possible with LotR LCG.
