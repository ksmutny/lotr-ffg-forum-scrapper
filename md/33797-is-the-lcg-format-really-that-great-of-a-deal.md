Seriously, I always thought on paper it sounded like such a great deal but in reality it is just as bad and possibly worse on the ol pocket-book as the typical CCG model.

Going by Warhammer Invasion, the 1st year of this game's existence there will be $280 worth of product.

$40 core game

$30x2 "big expansions"

$15x12 "small expansions"

That is 5 years of Descent products crushed into one year.

Card games are still INSANELY EXPENSIVE!!!

And let's see, what was black lotus or time walk worth for magic?  A single card that if you wanted to play with it cost you maybe $300?  And you're comparing $280 to have a playset of almost every card in the entire core set plus 14 expansions?  Not even close.  Knowing that everyone has access to a play set of every card and there is no rarity, booster packs, online singles being sold, etc. Oh yes... it is by far a great deal to answer your question.

If you think $1500 over 5 years is even close to what a top contender or someone who 'keeps up' on magic spent in 5 years... your'e insane lol.  Not even close.  So to answer your question, absolutely, if I really like the game and was looking to keep up on every single race, and newest card, that's well within reason and way way WAY cheaper than a ccg.

1st. Gaming is a hobby. Invest as much or as little as you like. 2nd If you are going to start comparing why don't you compare to other hobbies and see how it stands up. For example how about golfing. What does a good set of clubs and equipment cost? Country club dues or play fees? Regular expense for golf balls?  I mean, people will fork out a ton of money on other hobbies or on junk like 3 bucks for energy drink then complain because a pack of cards that expands the game they love to play cost them 10 bucks. I'm not trying to be rude here or sound harsh. It's just that I don't see the point of these kinds of posts when people bring them up.

I'm talking as a boardgamer...$300/yr for one game is a lot of cash.  It's not just some little purchase.  It's like saying you are going to buy all the core rule books for 2 RPGs...EVERY YEAR.

Whereas most boardgames might get one expansion a year clocking at at 1/6th price.

Speaking as someone who has played and collected alot of CCG's, LCG is very much superior and cheaper than any ccg. I see this becoming a more common thing.

I might add also that the new format you are getting 3 of every card in the expansions! How much would you spend trying get multiples of a lot of good uncommons or rares in other ccg's? I have all 3 games so far (and 3 sets of everything for Thrones) and most likely will get LOTR if it plays well. LCG model is awesome.

Yeah, it's more expensive than keeping up with a boardgame.  Nobody ever denied that.  But your original question was whether it was as expensive as a CCG, and most players say No.

All questions of cost need to be balanced by the question "Is it worth it?"  And that's a personal question.  Your answer can't possibly be the same as someone else's.

I just helped a guy move who had ten shelves full of boxes of baseball cards.  I thought to myself, "Hey, at least I get to play with my cards."  But at the end of the day, if that's how he wanted to spend his money and it made him happy, more power to him.

It was pointed out in another thread that to keep up with the 3 of everycard that is in the small expansions you would need 3 of the core set as well.

Using Warhammer Invasion as an example, are the large expansions that way as well?  Mostly singles and not 3x everything like the small expansion model FFG is currently implementing with Cthulhu?

So we are talking too much a commitment I think.

I might try the core game, but it is looking like I'll just keep playing MECCG.  It has been my fave game for 15 years and even though it is a "dead" CCG, it is still alive at my place!  And the #1 reason for that is solo rules from day 1.

That alone makes this new game by FFG, a better value than any of the other current CCGs/LCGs on the market.  Cause it wont' matter 15 years from now if it is still hip...cause you can still play it.

Good.  It's too bad they did not do that in the core set.  But it the only time you will have to do that though...just assume if you like the game you will be buying 3x core sets.

Is that confirmed?  They already screwed themselves IMO by not including 3 of EVERY card in the base set.  What's the point of making it a LCG if you cannot get it all in one box instead of six boxes for 2 people???

 

I do have to laugh at the guy talking about Magic cards that cost thousands of dollars.  That is a total fluke and a 1 time thing in Card Game history that will be hard to ever repeat.  Those cards are so rare and so few exist from such small print runs.  Todays basement designed games have print runs much larger than MTG in the beginning ever did.  LCG format is a whole lot more affordable for anyone that wants to play CG's.  FFG took a great step moving CCG's from that horrid booster pack crap format to this one.

 

I agree with you Frog on MECCG as the top LoTR CG.  I still have all mine from back in the day and nothing in the CG market has yet to really give you that lotr feel like it does.  Hell until WOTR came out there wasn't really a BG that gave you that feel IMO.  No way i will ever part with my MECCG collection either.

 There's still so little information about on this game, in terms of how it'll be packaged and deck construction, that it There's still so little information about on this game, in terms of how it'll be packaged and deck construction, that it's not even clear to me if we've had official word that there's a 3 card limit in decks, other than some people saying they were old during their demos that the expansions would follow the current LCG trend of 20x3.

If the shadow decks are going to be fixed, surely they'll just be whatever they are. Of cause people can make up their own missions and so shadow decks themed together, also I'm sure the rules will have something to cover tweaking shadow decks for greater and lesser challenge, but I'm still not taking anything as read in terms of what is or isn't a must buy.

I assume all 3 of the other LCGs work in that each expansion contains cards for all of the playable factions. The cycle then covers a bigger story, at least in WH:I, but has equal stuff for everyone. LotR, isn't using the basic 1v1 faction vs faction mechanic, so working on that assumption, in terms of having to keep buying to keep up could be a mistake.

From what I've read it seems as they expand it will be to introduce different geographic area of Middle Earth. Which seems to me to be easier to just skip a whole release or cycle of release without it being such an issue.

Also depending on quite how they release the stuff, you could always just buy the expansions that have the new quests and shadow decks and ignore the ones that focus on free peoples cards if you so choose.

Still having played CCGs since Magic beta, I can say with some certainty that LCGs are cheaper. Boardgames are cheaper still, but as others have said how much real worth is there in these comparisons

For one year, I'm collecting WH:I. I stop playing it some months ago, when the gameplay shifted into a game of "sniping opponent's cards as fast as possible", but I'm still collecting the cards, just in case FFG rewrites the game rules, or in case I come up with my own set of rules, ... or just to avoid considering I put so many money in a game that doesn't fit my taste enfadado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/enfadado.gif], and thus lost that money . And this latter reason is why I'm thinking LCG format isn't that unexpensive, even compared to CCGs.

Let's compare the 3 most expensive hobbies :

 * Non-collectible miniature games : you need to build an army. You exactly know what you buy, and you don't buy stuff you won't use unless you specificaly want to.
 * Collectible cards/miniatures games : you need to build a deck/army. You don't know what you'll get. You'll often get stuff you don't need, but you'll have chances to trade/sell it away. You'll also be able to buy single cards/minis in dedicated shops.
 * Living card games : you need to build a deck. You know exactly what you buy, but the packaging forces you to buy stuff you don't need, and you'll have pretty much no chances to trade/sell it away. You won't be able to buy singles.

So all in all, each game type as its own pros and cons. And for the casual player, each will be as expesnive as the others ($100 to get an army, or a box of boosters, or a core set and some chapters).

Things change when it comes to completists. To me, there are no completists in miniature games (let's imagine how much money a WH40K completists would need to build at least one army of every faction preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]), a "completist" will limits himself to 1-3 factions and get all minis of those factions. Being a completist in CCG (or even worst, in collectible minis, like I am for Monsteproclaypse) is the most expensive game hobby you'll found. But here again, you can limit yourself to all cards of one side (like in Star Wars), or color (MTG). It is here that the LCG is cheaper : for completists. But are we all completists ? (I admit I am).

One has to admit that the way FFG designed its chapters/battlepacks, if you want to collect one side/color/faction/whatever, you end up collecting the whole game (and thus buy cards you don't want). And this isn't saving money for the players. I'm OK with FFG being a company that needs to make money (as all companies do), I'm not OK with defending the LCG format as being so much cheaper than CCG : you simply don't end up with the same stuff (complete sets vs partial collection geared toward deckbuilding).

hey, Frog, never played magic seriously?

let's say some numbers (in Europe):

a 15 card booster pack costs 3,90 € and you can find 1 rare card, or if you are very lucky 2 rare cards. A set is composed by 250 cards, so if you want that 40 cards to build a deck you have to buy if you are the luckiest guy in the world 4 packs (never heard for that xD) and you have, if you are lucky, 8 rare cards, that is riddicolous, my white deck has 20 rare cards and i still need other cards. This "operation" costs 16€ (okok that can't happen in real life) and if you want the 20 lands you still need you have to buy a starter set that costs another 10€. ok, til now we spent 26€ and we have -60 useful cards and 60 unuseful cards for a total of 10 competitive cards (rare cards)  = 120 cards (and some of then are not unique)

if you are not lucky and you want to buy single cards you have to spend mhhh 10 € for 20 commonc cards, 20€ for 20 uncommon cards, 40€ for 20 rare cards and you have 60 cards for 70€

then every 3 months there is a new expansion of 250 cards with new rares that you need and another money to spend.

In LCG you can buy the core set : 35€ and you have 216 unique cards, you are competitive and you can build different decks with only 1 core set

every month a new 60 cards expansion will be available for about 10-12€ and you know what there is in the expansion so if you don't want it you don't buy it

in magic if you want a card you have to buy as many packs until you find it.

> Living card games : you need to build a deck. You know exactly what you buy, but the packaging forces you to buy stuff you don't need, and you'll have pretty much no chances to trade/sell it away. You won't be able to buy singles.

that's not true, you can buy singles from other players like ALL of the other card games ^^

Hobbies are expensive yes. Check out some other card gamer's habits. At Gencon, I saw some guy 60 bucks a few times just to get some rares and uncommons he needed for Universal Fighting System. Some guy offered someone else 10 dollars for a card.

In Vampire the Eternal Struggle, every release of 200 some cards I would buy 3 booster boxes. (240 dollars). Yes I would hit the secondary market and sell some of those off, but I wasn't selling extras. I was deciding between cards I wanted to keep, vs. cards I wanted to sell. I had to evalualte on an individual basis if a card was worth keeping in my collection vs how much money I could get for it. Even if I wasn't to sell them, I would still be having significant gaps in my collection.

Magic the Gathering, people buy 2-3 boxes every release and have big gaps (thanks to the fourth rarity), and we're talking GAPS gaps, not "i need my fourth copy of BLAH still" gaps (well those too)... That's close to 300 dollars.

For your 280 dollars how many cards are you getting? (actually I don't know...). but that's 20 seperate cards per expansion. That's already 240 cards which is the size of some of the aforementioned games expansions.

 If they were to include 3x of each in the core set, they would have to either make it a lot more expensive or have a lot less diversity of cards. The LCG core sets come with about 200 cards divided into four different decks.

## 20 [Karazax on August 10, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/33797-is-the-lcg-format-really-that-great-of-a-deal/?do=findComment&comment=340974)

It's not just the old Magic cards that are extremely expensive as singles .  Some of the top level standard format current decks retail in at ~$700 for a single deck if you were to buy every single at card shop prices with the introduction of Mythical rarity.  In comparison you could get 3 x of every single card printed for a Game of Thrones for less than that and provide yourself and several friends with tournament caliber decks.   You can get all of the game of thrones chapter packs that have been released to this point for just over $6 each online.  Yes you can buy singles in magic, but there are tons of singles that run more than the price of a chapter pack or even a core set or deluxe expansion. Cards like the new Jace the Mind Sculptor, baneslayer angel, ect, and Magic has the 4 copy per deck limit instead of 3.

Trading isn't completely ruled out as an option in LCG either if you are willing to limit yourself to one or two factions and have friends who play different factions that you can trade with or split the purchase of packs with.  Being an absolute completionist is more of a collector issue than a gaming one anyway as far as getting 3 x of EVERY chapter pack.  Some packs just don't have any singles that your faction may need duplicates of, and if you choose to play EVERY faction with 3 copies of every card, well then you can hardly be considered a casual player.

And no, you don't NEED 3 x core set just because the new chapter packs will have 3 copies of everything.  The core set cards obviously will make up less and less of your total play deck as more 3 x packs are released, but as long as your opponents are playing with similar limitations it will still stay balanced.  You only NEED 3 x of everything if you are trying to compete with opponents who are playing with 3 x of everything.  And if you do buy multiple chapter packs and end up with cards you don't need, it's no different than buying a ccg booster box and getting duplicates you don't need that are commons and have zero trade or resale value.  Except the LCG player knew what rares were in his packs before he bought them. 

Whether you play casually or competitively, you will get more unique cards for your money with the LCG set up.  But you can't compare the price of playing a CCG casually with a starter deck to playing an LCG with 3 x of every card every printed and expect the LCG to be cheap.  But if you want a card game that does not require any collecting you might want to check out Dominion or Thunderstone or the upcoming Ascension: Chronicles of the Godslayer.

What is all this talking about 'keeping up'? It's a friggin' cooperative game!

There's no need to keep up with anything or anyone. Buy the game, play it till you get bored, then buy expansions as you see fit or play something else entirely.

Jhaelen is right. LCG is the perfect format for a coop game. After all, isn't "Arkham Horror" a coop "living boardgame" with its many expansions ?

And here, the ability to build multiple decks from a single collection is definately golden : you'll be able to play mutliplayers just with one player collection. And if you end up with a "weaker" deck, it is not your problem, it is the problem of your teammates cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

If you want to travel and explore the cool regions of Middle Earth, you will have to buy tons of expansions to get there.

It sounds like they are doing one region at a time.  It seems that many of you have no idea just how big Middle Earth really is and that you will never get to those really cool locations without buying a gazillion expansions. 

With MECCG, the very first set had around 500 cards, all the main characters from all the books, factions, enemies, and locations.  You could travel from one side of Middle-Earth to the other rather than being stuck in Mirkwood for 6 "mini expansions".

Sure, you can buy just the core set...but you might be stuck in Farmer Maggot's field fighting rats and crows!  lol

If it is really set up this way, then I'll pass.  Otherwise, of course I'd like to try the game out.

It will be setup like the other LCG's in that the packs(adventure packs I think for this game) will add content to the game. But you by no means have to get that stuff. Trust me I have the AgoT and W:I games and you can play forever on just a core set. I'd say just get the core set and play with that, if you get bored and want more get the packs, otherwise you will have a complete game with just the core set and low investment.

Frog said:

That's definately right. But here, I'll use other people's argument : you can't have as many cards as in MECCG cardset for a fraction of its price. To explore the land in MECCG, you needed at least 5 starters (to get all the fixed cards, including some heroes, locations and reasons to get there like the corresponding factions cards). That alone is worthing the price of 2 core sets (roughly).

But here again, the coop aspect of the game may save it, for you : as a MECCG player (from what I understand) you have access to its amazing artwork. Thus, nothing prevents you from designing your own cards, and quest decks. Moreover, since the game is coop, it'll be quite easy to get the other players' agreement for using your custom cards and deck. So, if you adhere to the game system (resolving quests and killing monsters, as it was abstracted from GenCon report) you may expand the game the way you want, and explore the regions you like. Personnaly, I just can't wait for a "King Under The Mountain" quest deck gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]).

I too miss MECCG much sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

If the game is fun will having the option to buy more locations to explore be a problem?  Besides you don't have to buy ALL of them even if you like it.  Think of it more as options than requirements.  It's kind of like saying you shouldn't bother to read Fellowship of the Ring, because you won't get the whole story without buying Two Towers and Return of the King too. 

I haven't played the MECCG, but I suspect this FFG version will be taking a much more detailed, up close and personal look at each location.  Besides, how much did it cost to get a full play set of all 500 cards in MECCG?  None of the chapter packs have been announced for the FFG version, nor even card lists for the core set.  So it is premature to say how long each location will be focused on.  I think it is safe to say the core set will not be focused on exploring Farmer Maggot's field though.  The core set is what sells the game and it has to be successful for FFG to get any sales on future chapter packs, so expect it to be a self contained game designed to be fun on it's own.  FFG will post the rules online before the game goes on sale, and there will be multiple reviews to read here and over on BGG after release to help you decide if it is right for you.  If it is like the current LCG core sets, you should be able to buy it online for ~$25 so it won't be nearly the investment it would take to the same variety of cards in a typical ccg.

Don't get me wrong, I am in no way bashing this game or FFG.  I love their games and the quality of their products.  If I did not think this game had serious potential I would not even be posting in this sub-forum.  Middle-Earth Quest was not the type of game I was wanting (flexible questing adventure game...it is really a strategy game).  This on the other hand looks somewhat like MECCG. 

The art does look really good.  The solo/co-op aspects are the only reason I am even considering it.

I am just being cautious so I don't fail a corruption-check and turn into ol Gollum himself!

(besides, like I said I have all the MECCG cards I'll ever need.  7 booster boxes(Wizards, Dragons, Dark Minions) and 1 box of starters, all the books, maps, dice etc.)

There's no need to keep up with anything or anyone. Buy the game, play it till you get bored, then buy expansions as you see fit or play something else entirely.

This was well put.

But let's be honest: most of us are collectors, and collectors are obsessive completists. And since FFG has made it so easy to be a completist with the LCG format, it's almost compulsory.

With Magic the Gathering, building a full playset is insanely outside of most people's price range. A full playset for the 2011 core set is around $1000 on the secondary market, if you can find it. But since that's out of the question, there exists a lot of "casual" collectors who don't have full playsets, but have a lot of cards and build interesting and fun decks out of those limited cards.

I think there are fewer of these "casual" collectors in the LCG format. And while I don't have any numbers to back this up, I suspect that a "casual" collector of magic might spend less per year than a completist buying an LCG. Of course, the LCG player will have a lot more cards, and a lot more variety, but he or she will have spent more money, too.

I think this is how FFG is turning a healthy profit from these LCGs. By lowering the price-point for completism, they induce a casual gamer to spend more than he probably would have on a blind purchase game in order to get a full playset of the LCG.

He spends more, but he gets more. It's like super-sizing your hobby.

I think I will buy the core set of the Lord of the Rings LCG. But since it is cooperative, I think I will do as efidm suggests: play the core set until I get bored, and then buy expansions, probably only the big box expansions. I already collect A Game of Thrones, and I don't think I can afford to buy every product for another LCG. And, since it's not competitive, there's not that additional inducement to have as many deck options as possible.

I don't think that it's a great deal for people who want to play multiple LCGs.  happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] I do kinda wish that expansions came out bi-monthly so I could have more time to explore the cards and fiddle around with decks.  Even though there is no real official support for, say, Warhammer: Invasion, competitive play is definitely out there, and while the arms race is significantly less expensive than M:TG, it still exists. Can't have everything, I guess.  If LotR LCG offers enough game variety like MECCG did, I'd be ok with keeping up.  I think the real issue here is that we, the consumers, decided we would pay a little more than we should for these products AND buy 3x copies of core sets, and now we're hooked!

At most, FFG version can be as detailed as MECCG, but not more. MECCG is a game that allows you to build your whole strategy around Mirkwood : go raise the Elves at Thranduil's Hall, visit Beorn's House, get Gwaihir at its eyrie, and rescue some prisoners in Dol Guldur, just to name the major possibilities in this small area. corazon.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/corazon.gif]

Frog said:

To make a deck you need Heroes and Quests. So if they are in such limited numbers, and some only in big expansions then buying up all the small expansions is a waste because you still don't have new quests(possibly heroes as well) to construct decks with your old cards. Instead, you have to keep ripping apart your 4 core decks to play with the new cards.

From what I understood about the game, Quests form the "deck to beat". So it is just the challenge that is quite limited (in term of variety). You have 12 unique heroes to base your decks upon (let's assume you start with them in play), but we may have a lot of variety here (if you break the precons). You could base them upon a sphere of influence (or more likely 2), or a common trait (dwarf, ranged attack, and so on, according to what the game will provide). I guess that permutating heroes between decks will have important effects in the resulting decklist.

In WH:I, the Core Set comes with 4 preconstructed decks. You can mix them to try to build a "better" deck, but the result is quite limited... with 1 Core Set. With a second Core Set, you can base your strategy on cards that were only once or twice in the Core Set, and thus create totally new decks. (BTW, adding in a third Core Set doesn't improve much your decks). I guess LotR will be the same : with 1 core set, your custom decks will be quite identical to the precons, but with a second Core Set, you may try new strategies that might be competitive (against the quest deck). Plus the second Core Set allows you to play with 2 more peoples, so it is not "just for the cards" buy.

I guess the "battlepacks" will allows you to fine tune your heroes' decks. But perhaps they will introduce new creatures and locations to be placed in the quest deck (like the character packs of "WoW : the Adventure Game" add new encounters to the game).

Last, since the game was demoed at GenCon, * crosses his fingers *, FFG will likely released an noline version of the rulebook soon. With this document, it'll be easier to know if the game will please you or not.

Just as FYI MECCG is one of THE most expensive CCG's to get cards for from a game that has long been out of print today.  At the time of the printing of the game though most stores were discount selling it because it never caught on due to the complexity of the game.  I bought or traded for at least 5-6 boxes of the base set and each expansion along with numerous starter deck boxes and got them for about 1/10th of what they go for in today's secondary market.  Hell the map pack booklet sells for $200-300 a shot and it sat on shelves back in the day collecting dust.   I would still hope that as a LCG this version of the game is much simpler and has a price tag of far less than all previous CG's in the ME genre.

Toqtamish- If you still have your cards there are many player aids out there now and many detailed guides to learning how to play the game.  If you like the ME lore go dig around some online and you'll be playing the game in no time at all.  In many respects it plays more like a BG with cards as player aids than it does as a pure CG.

I just looked in an old box of card games I had from the 90's and found 4 boxes with the rules and another batch of cards not in the box of Middle Earth the Wizards card game. I had never played it and just bought it for the art work. I was playing Magic at the time but bought some other card games, Spellfire, Wyvern.

I am looking forward to this new card game however to play. Quite frankly I think I will like the co-op format. I'm sure I will more use of these cards than the ones in the boxes.

Going off of the "friggin' cooperative" bark (gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] to Jhaelen), couldn't a team of players make multiple decks out of the same single set?  With each expansion adding more cards to each?  What I'm asking is, not every player needs to buy their own set, right?  Not like Call of Cthulhu or Game of Thrones, which by being competitive LCGs, requires everyone to buy their own sets.  So If I bought one of everything (the aforeestimated $300/yr), that would be enough to supply 3-4 players worth of decks?  I suppose if you really wanted to go the "skinflint" route, you could charge everyone a few bucks to use one of your new expansions... demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

On the other hand...I loved Decipher's Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.  Both defunct.  Player pools will continue to dwindle until snuffed out.  In my area/circle of friends, I have no opponents.  Thousands of dollars...barely worth the paper they're printed on.  In fact, I have quite a few CCGs I invested in back in the day, most of them I am truly embarrassed to have ever been involved with.  All of these are even more worthless.  For the sake of argument, let's assume that this new LOTR LCG came out during the same time as all those embarrassing CCGs and I invested in it as well.  If I were to wander into my closet, which card game could I play right now?  More than a decade later?  While stranded on a deserted island?

THAT seems to be worth the investment.  Go on, get bored with it.  Bury it in your attic for several years.  And when you dig it out again, maybe it won't be just pretty-looking kindling for the fireplace.

Based on most CCGs value per dollar, I have to say that the LCG format is king. I use to be an avid MtG fan, but over time I gave up it's system. In order to be competitive I was spending upwards to 60-75 dollars a month on a WHOLE box of booster packs to try and get the cards I needed for deck strategies and muling through comic store displays and E-bay to buy overpriced singles. It finally burned me out as I saw how much waste was created by this system. How much card-stock was basically thrown into my paper recycling bin at work to at least make some of it seem to have 're-purpose' for the hundreds upon hundreds of useless doubles. 

I stopped playing card games for a while because of the waste of money and resources that went with it. When I saw that FFG was creating card games that had a specified card list and that the expansion packs also had set cards in them, I was immediately drawn back in, Practically no doubles because of no randomization and very fair pricing compared to other card game models. It was still a little expensive before they changed the format of the expansions to include triples, but still no where near what I paid a month for MtG. The only disappointment I have had with LotR:LCG is the starting set not completely following the same setup and some useful cards only coming in doubles and singles. However, since I pretty much only play this for personal enjoyment and not professionally, it doesn't bother me to make a few paper pen proxies to make up for them. Now that I am only paying 15 dollars a month and every time it's brand new content that adds to the game, I am very happy with the cost effectiveness of this hobby. 

I know people who are willing to pay that much a month just for a online video game that only gets expanded every year or two! So I think I am getting a very nice deal on LCGs from a content and price perspective.

If you think this is expensive it isn't compared to most ccgs. Lets take magic as an example, you buy 1 pack for 4$ you get 15 maybe 16 cards (possible to get a foil chase). The breakdown only includes 1 rare, lets assume you stick to one or two colors you really love. Based on the newest expansion innistrad you will need 42 cards for each color 13 of which are rare or mythic (only one per pack) This doesn't include artifacts or rare lands. Now if we want a playset and assume we are super lucky and can pack or trade for what we need we are looking at roughly 208$ every 3 months or so for 1 color, 416$ for 2. Over a year this adds up to over 1600$ probably closer to 2000$. Do you want to be a tier 1 player who can regularly win tournaments? double that number maybe more. LCGs are an incredible value even if you can't trade away the extras. This is a fun game at a reasonable price in a format that most adults can afford if they chose to.

Hey guys, this thread was resurrected from over a year ago. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I would like to point out though, that I picked up Warhammer: Invasion, all three big box sets, and about 15 of the battle packs for less than $200. Retail price is one thing, and actual price is another. I also only spend about $10-12 on the adventure packs for LotR typically.

Either way, this game is far cheaper than a CCG but more expensive than your typical board game. I don't mind at all, it's about $10-15/month on average. That's not much at all really. I've been paying that for MMOs for over a decade (sometimes 2 at a time), and when I stop paying for that I don't get to keep playing.

This isn't boardgame, is a collectible card game.

People are throwing out comparisions for Magic: The Gathering, here is one for the Decipher CCG: the ultra rare Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and Emperor Palpaltine from the Death Star II expansion were worth more then $300 apiece. That is a years worth of an FFG LCG for one card. Darth Vaders were worth over $100. When playing Star Wars, you play a light side deck, and then a dark side deck against the same player. To have a deck worth playing, you needed many rare, powerful cards, and would be looking at about $500 decks if you bought the cards individully. Want to build a space deck? Now you are going to need multiple copies of the more powerful space ships, which run about $20 apiece (my favorite was Artoo-Detoo In Red 5).

 

I love playing CCGs, but the cost was just too much. Paying hunderds for boxes of booster packs every time a new set come out (3x a year for a normal CCG) in order to keep up is not fun (and then have hunderes of copies of common cards that are worthless). I got back into playing only because Game of Thrones is an LCG. $500 later I have all the cards for the game, and can build the same deck as any world champ.

I've got a similar opinion like mason or Avery Frost. I stopped playing CCGs some years ago. In LCGs, especially cooperative ones, you get much more for your money. For 15 $ / 10 € FFG / the publisher in my country creates 2 new player cards for every sphere, a new hero, and 3 new neutral cards. In just the amount you need, not more and not less. And FFG invents a new, hopefully interesting quest with its own story, thematically fitting locations, objectives and treachery cards etc. I think this is a really good deal. And if I ever want to stop buying new APs, the disadvantages are not as severe as in competitive games with a high power creep - you can still grab a friend or 2 or 3 and play the quests you already have with the cards you already have. If I'd use a constructed deck consisting of my old MtG cards from Mirage and Visions and so on, I just don't have a chance nowadays...

And with traits, it's preferable for players too, to create thematically fitting decks (e.g Rohan, or creatures+eagles) to get synergies. This is much more interesting than the "uhm, card X has a little better use-to-cost ratio than card Y, so I've got to use it to win the game. Flavour is for losers!"

So in a nutshell, in my opinion, this cooperative LCG is much more cheaper than CCGs, is thematically fitting for LotR (also the encounterd eck is usually fitting well), and it doesn't force players to buy new packs, but instead gives them positive incentives (the new quests) to keep buying it. Until now, I bought all products available in my language for LotR (all the APs, but only 1 core set though), and I think I will stick to it, as long as none of the mentioned points gets worsened. I really like the LCG format.

i'm also a completist and a collector. big fan of the artwork. also a strategist. chess is played by people who have the same 16 pieces on the same board with 64 squares. if you get beaten it's because of your own mistakes or the other is that much better than you. but just like in real life there are factors beyond your control, things you can't predict. that's why i like lcg much better. it provides an even playing field for all players. learn how to build a good deck. learn how to beat the other decks.  in thrones for example, there are plots and events that bring bring element of life into a game. it's not always the smartest guy who wins. in ccg getting beaten by  an opponent because he has a bigger pocketbook or has been collecting for 10 years longer does not sit well with me . total bollocks. i'm not a gambler. i like to know what i'm getting when i give my money  way. if i want to play lottery i'll play 6-49. some people get a high playing the lottery. then ccg is for you. i've done ccg and by the end feel used by marketers. i wish all games went lcg. but that's me. . . i do admit i get that aweome feeling when you take your new expansion pack out of the shrink wrap, open the box and start drooling over the amazing artwork, gears a spinning, you're slowly going over every card, every detail, every word. for some it's like christmas morning every time they open one. on the flip side when a ccg player opens his pack a finds that super super rare card that know one in the world has that's a pretty special feeling too.

 Pulling a rare card can be fun, but it's a fleeting joy. Having a solidly fun game to play and replay is what I'm after.
