 What is the official difficulty of this quest? I can't seem to find it listed anywhere.

 8 or 9 was sometimes stated from FFG.

But all this difficult levels are very subjective.

It is a ver hard quest but gets easier the more cards you get and the more you play. Boromir often shines in this quest.
