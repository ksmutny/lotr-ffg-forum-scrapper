 I was curious about picking this up, but are there any other San Antonio players?

There are a couple of us that meet at a boardgame meetup Thursday nights at Gamelot.

 Do you meet up regularly?

Every thursday night, starting around 7.  We don't always play LOTR, game selection is more of a free-for-all, but if someone really wants to play something, they can usually be accommodated.

Which heroes do you use for your deck?  I can try to make something that will work with whats left over, since we can't all use the same heroes.
