## 1 [Stenun on October 28, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73401-the-battle-of-lake-town-question-spoilers-for-one-of-the-cards-text/?do=findComment&comment=715750)

My copy of the PoD expansion The Battle Of Lake-Town has finally arrived and I had a quick read through of the cards and have immediate questions about one card:  Fisherman's Dock.

"Travel:  If there is 1 active location, exhast a hero to travel here.  (There are now 2 active locations.)"

 

Once you have those two active locations, do they both get Progress Tokens simultaneously or do you have to choose one to put the progress tokens on?  If I quest succesfully by 3, do both locations get 3 tokens each or do I have to choose one of them to get 2 and the other to get 1, for example.

What if I play Ancestral Knowledge ("Exhaust a dwarf to place 2 progress tokens on the active location" or use Lorien Guide ("After Lorien Guide commits to a quest, place 1 progress token on the active location")?  Will these cards place the same number of progress tokens on both active locations?  Meaning that Ancestral Knowledge will put two on Fisherman's Dock and two on the other active location?

 

What about West Road Traveller?

"Response:  After you play West Road Traveller from your hand, switch the active location with any other location in your staging area."

If I have previously used the text of Fisherman's Dock to end up with 2 active locations and then I play West Road Traveller, can I switch Fisherman's Dock for a different location that doesn't talk about having 2 simultaneous active locations?  Could I theoretically end up with North Pier and West Pier as simultaneous active locations?

 

If I have two active locations thanks to Fisherman's Dock but then play, for example, Strider's Path which says: "If another location is currently active, return it to the staging area", do both locations get returned to the staging area?

 

I would have thought that something as mechanics-altering as possibly having two active locations would have been covered in the rules, to be honest, it's only going to lead to many more questions down the road …

As nobody here seems to know the answers, I emailed FFG and asked them directly *g*.

Got a reply within moments so I thought I'd post the answers here for all to see.

Each active location is treated separately. The players may choose how to distribute the 3 progress among the 2 active locations.

Again, treated separately: the player who controls Lorien Guide will have to choose which active location to place the 1 progress on.

When you play West Road Traveller you may choose 1 active location to switch.

If you were to switch the Fisherman's Dock with another location, that would create an illegal play state for the new active location. You would then have to return 1 of the active locations to the staging area because the rules only allow you to have 1 at a time. It is only the ability on the Fisherman's Dock that allows you to break that rule.

You would have to choose one, but keep in mind the illegal game state created by having two active locations if one of them is not Fisherman's Dock.
