As per title. The "immune to player cards effect" clause makes me wonder if there are any means to heal him.

 

Thanks for help

Yes, he is unhealable.

 

You can however use cards like Landroval to resurrect him after he dies.

Thanks a million! I imagined so, but it's nice to know there's no card around able to bypass the effect (so I can stop digging into tons of APs searching for it)

Other good cards for Beorn are Close Call [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Close-Call-TDT] (cancel damage but raise threat) and Dori [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Dori-THOHaUH] (put damage on Dori instead of Beorn).

Yea, the cards that GrandSpleen mentioned target the damage, not the hero, so they can be used on Beorn.

(anyhoo, testing Tactics + Leadership with Beorn, Elladan and Elrohir, and testing Spirit + Lore with Elrond, Eowyn and Bilbo. Spectacular heroes! This game is simply incredible)
