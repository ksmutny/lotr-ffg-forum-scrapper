 On the Caught In A Web card, it mentions to pay 2 resources from that hero's pool.  Does that mean that both points have to come from the attached hero's pool or can you pay with the party pool like you can when playing allies and attachments? I am guessing it is the first one, but wanted to get opinions.

I'm with option A. Makes for a nasty "debuff", but seems to be the clearest reading of the card. Thematically, it specifically slows that hero down.

If that's what the card says, then that's how you play it: both resource tokens must come from the hero it's attached to.

It specifies hero so it has to come from their personal pool. If it wasn't specific it would just say *pay 2 from the hero's sphere of influence.*

 That's what I figured.  Thanks, guys.
