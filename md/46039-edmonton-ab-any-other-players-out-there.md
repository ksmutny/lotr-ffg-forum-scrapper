Hey, just looking for any other Edmonton players.  Both my wife and I play, and I will be talking to the guy at Warp 1 who runs all the CCG/TCG/LCG stuff about maybe getting some game time or tournament stuff going.

 

Let me know!

I am from Edmonton originally but now leave out east on the Atlantic coast. That being said I have some friends in Calgary who play card games and will be playing this game.

Received my game boxes today, 2 core sets.

 

Hoping a fellow Edmontonian is reading this!

I live in Edmonton, and I just bought the game today, but I move to Stony Plain at the end of the month.  If you're looking for other people to play this with, you could try checking out Mission Fun and Games in St. Albert.  I'll probably start dropping by there every now and then.  They have game nights every second Friday.  I believe that's where the Edmonton Board Game League often plays as well, and you can look them up online.  They've got a pretty cool setup on their site that even includes badges kinda like XBox achievements for all sorts of cool and funny stuff.

I also noticed today that Mission will be doin a Hunt For Gollum preview/demo coming up sometime fairly soon.  I didn't see a date, and I forgot to ask, so I don't know when though.
