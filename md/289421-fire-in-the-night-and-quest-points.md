Perhaps a stupid question, but when playing Fire in The Night to win is it still necessary to have 50 quest points on the main quest in addition to having dealt >20 damage to Dagnir or is it enough to simply have dealt >20 damage to the dragon to win automatically? That is to say the 50 quest points printed on the main quest are still a necessary objective to achieve to be able to win or are simply a reminder of how much damage Hrogar's Hill can take before losing?

Since the quest card says "If Dragnir has no hit points, the players win", that suffices.  The effective purpose of the 50 is to supply a damage comparison for the loss condition.

@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/] has certainly got it, but just to mention, as the same question has arisen on Discord several times… Shadow and Flame similarly has a win condition printed on a quest card, and a quest point requirement that nevertheless does not have to be met to win:

Another parallel example is winning by destroying the Stormcaller in Flight of the Stormcaller. (This win condition is printed on the Stormcaller itself, not the quest card, but it makes little material difference.)

Ok, then it was easier then we expected, we ended it in 6 turns, with only 29 damage on Hrogar's Hill and low threats. We were probably lucky with the side quests deck (we completed 5 of them, basically one each round) and a 4-defenses-per-turn Beregond (Unexpected Courage, Armored Destrier and Magic Ring) really pulled its weight.

Did you use tactics or spirit? And did you heal beregond or boost his defense?

We use four mono-sphere decks (I should perhaps have specified this), TaBeregond had a Gondorian Shield and an Hauberk of Mail to boost his defense and for healing we had in play (with Elrond) a Warden of Healing and an Imladris Caregiver, plus a Lembas that was cycled by an Erebor Hammersmith.
