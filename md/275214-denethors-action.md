Greetings

I am in my second game and it's going very easy compared to my first try with Tactics Deck.  I am exploring the Lore deck this time out. 

 

My question deals with Denethor Action.  If I want to use him for questing for 1 point will that trigger his action? This guy seems very useful and powerful...Or do I have to exhaust him in the phase and forgo the one point of willpower?

 

Thank you in advance

Both Denethor's action and questing require exhaustion, which means you can exhaust Denethor to commit him to the quest, or you can exhaust him to perform his action, but one exhaustion will NOT pay for both choices.  You have to choose.

My favorite role for Denethor was not to commit him to the quest (he's only got one point of willpower anyways), but reserve him for defense.  If he's not needed for defense, I then use his action to see what the next card revealed will be, and decide whether to toss it.

Thanks for your answer!

This explains why I was making such good progress. I'll scratch this game and restart. I like how you play Denethor. I will give your plan a test run. 

 

again, thank you.
