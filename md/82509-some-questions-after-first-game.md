## 1 [Kopos on April 17, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82509-some-questions-after-first-game/?do=findComment&comment=786043)

hello

we played our first game last night (easiest scenario without shadow cards) and we had some issues i would like to clarify

- Ungoliant - Ungoliant came out before the final phase (on phase 1) of the scenario and we were able to kill it / her in 2 turns. How does it work afterwards? Does the game end automatically when we arrive at phase 3? does it "come back to life" in the final phase of the scenario? we're really puzzled with this since the rulebook states that "all the cards" with the arachnid logo must be included in the deck

- Eowyn - can both players discard any number of cards per turn or only 1 each in order to activate her ability?

- Deck - how many cards can one player have in his / her deck? is there a limit?

- Hand limit - how many cards can one player have at any given moment in his / her hand?

One final question…do you recommend mixing icons (Spirit, Ledership, etc) in one deck for beginners? im asking this because i dont know if playing with just one icon is strong enough to defeat, lets say, the final scenario of the core set. What do you think?

Thanks in advance

bruno

1. you must refind and re kill her in 3b. you draw her out of the discard pile when you flip the 3b card (unless its beorns path)

2. each player may discard only 1 card each per round

3.no upper limit….technically no lower limit though tournament rules state a deck needs at least 50 cards. only 3 copies of each card allowed per deck unless otherwise stated (only 2 of these in later packs)

4.as many as you can get. you could have your whole deck in your hand. once it runs out though it runs out

5.you will need to mix icons to have success at this game beyond the start scenario….the game basically expects mixed deck building and most players get alot of enjoyment  (not to mention replayability) out of this aspect. for instance a spirit deck will quest well but get killed by enemies, a tactics deck will fight well but get threat to 50 and lose the game fairly quickly due to poor questing

its all about mixing. are you mainly a solo player or above? the advice on decks will depends on that. i have some advice in either way

take a look at the strategy sub section and the 'suggested decks' thread….i have wrote a post in there that may be of help

hope this helps

When you say "draw her out" do you mean:

a) pick it from the discard pile and reshuffle it on the deck or

b) wait until the deck is over and shuffle the discard pile as the new deck?

Another questions that  arose during today's match

- lets say that that Treachery that deals 1 dmg to every character that commited to a quest and i have, lets say, Daughter of the Nimrodel committed. Can i save her, ie, since a action can be taken right afterwards can i save her with her ability?

- A hero is a character? i understand that an ally is everything but  a character but im not sure if a hero is also a character

- Engaging - what's the difference between Forest Spider and Hummerhorns? the spider says "after spider engages a player" and the hummerhorns says "after hummerhorns engages you"…does this mean that if i decide to engage the hummerhorns they dont deal 5 additional damage but it doesnt matter if im the one to engage the spider or the other way around? 

Thanks!

For Ungoliant:

When you get to 3B, you will have to search the encounter deck and/or encounter deck discard pile for Ungoliant's Spawn and put it into play, regardless of whether or not you have defeated it once already.  It must be defeated while you are on 3B in order to count.  For this reason, if the card comes out before you reach 3B, it's best to keep her in play (i.e., don't kill her) until you get to the last quest card.

Treachery: I think you mean The Necromancer's Reach.  This deals 1 damage to every exhausted character.  It doesn't matter if they are committed to the quest-- if they are exhausted but not committed to the quest they will get damage (e.g., if you used Beregond's ability she'll be exhausted but not questing).  Also, if they are committed to the quest but not exhausted, they will not be damaged (e.g., if you used Aragorn's self-readying ability after committing to the quest).  

As for Daughter of the Nimrodel, you can't use her ability to save herself because: 1) she can only target heroes, not allies, and 2) the damage from the treachery card is immediate, and you are not allowed to use any abilities that say "Action" until you have finished revealing cards from the encounter deck and have resolved all of their effects.  Also, if she is exhausted, you can't use her ability.  She needs to be ready in order to use it (the card says: "Exhaust Daughter of the Nimrodel to…."  This means you have to exhaust her at the time that you want to use her ability).

"Character" means hero or ally.  

And for engaging enemies, there is no difference between engaging an enemy and being engaged by an enemy.  Optional engagement of enemies and forced engagement of enemies due to engagement checks have the same effect.  Both will trigger any "Forced" text on a card that triggers off of engagement.

Hope that helps,

GS

Hey there

Considering Ungoliath, now i get it and fortunatelly, i've played it correctly, since i 've done that: i took it from the discard pile and placed it in play. i thought that i had to shuffle it again in the deck

Now that i see my second question, i realize that that wasnt my real question, since there are some aspects of it that are easy to understand, but since you gave me an amazing answer, ie that covered every aspect, i know now the answer to my real question:)

Considering engaging i still dont get it when i compare Forest Spiders and Hummerhorns: the rulebook states everything you mentioned. The thing is, i consider Hummerhorns  to have a significantly different text from everybody else but, from your answer, i suspect that im doing it wrong. In this case how can one defeat Hummerhorn without losing a hero (5 points of damage usually kills a hero)?

thanks

You can deal with Hummerhorns in 4 ways…

1, let it kill a hero!  Not nice.  

2, give somebody more HP to anticipate the damage.  Citadel Plate will do this in the Core Set.  There are other cards too, but not in the Core Set, I think.  There is only one hero currently available who starts the game with more than 5 HP (Beorn, from the first Hobbit box set).

3, kill it/discard it while it is still in the staging area.  Dunhere can do this, as can Gandalf using his 'enter play' ability.

4, finish the game before you have to engage it.  It has a 40 engagement cost, so if you play a quick game you can beat the clock.
