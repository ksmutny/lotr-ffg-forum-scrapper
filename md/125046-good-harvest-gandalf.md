Can Gandalf use the event Good Harvest? Or he can't cause of he is neutral?

To play cards from hand using Gandalf's resources?

 

Wouldn't work.  Good Harvest allows you to spend resources from "any sphere," but Neutral is "no sphere" (per the core set).

And, if he has attached a song card? Like Combat Song, Travel Song, King Song, etc?

Then his resources take on that sphere, so he can play for cards of that color from your hand (or any color if you then play Good Harvest while a song is attached).

I disagree. I think the correct answer is: depends.

 

Played from your hand? Wouldn't do anything if all you have is Gandalf, since he is neutral. So my answer is the same.

 

Played from the top of your deck? Gandalf just gained all four resource icons when the card was played, thus activating its ability and making all four resources available for the duration of that phase.

 

Edit: Available as one of the options to be named, that is. You still have to pick just one.

No, Gandalf is only considered to have those resources icons while he is paying for the card.  Once you have paid for Good Harvest (or any other card) and finished playing it from your deck, he is no longer considered to have any resource icons.

 

If those icons lasted until the end of the phase, Gandalf would be super duper broken.

Alright, I just conceded the point on BBG and will here as well.

 

But I also thought of another creative use. It's convoluted and ridiculous to waste the set up on this combo, but here it is:

 

Longbeard Map-Maker. There are many simpler (and more recommended) ways to get Lore resources, but say you have him in play already, play A Good Harvest from the top of your deck, and shout "Lore!" Now you can use any of Gandalf's resources to boost the Map-Maker up. While you don't have a Lore icon in play to play additional cards, A Good Harvest has said all those neutral resources you've stockpiled (right?) can be used a Lore for this phase.

 

Edit: Looks like the good old Stand and Fight ruling is going to invalidate this as well. No harvest is a good harvest for Gandalf.

His ressource icon is just for playing cards on top of your deck... I don't understand how you could use good harvest with him at all, longbeard map maker cannot be boost this way. You'll have your lore icon only when playing good harvest, and when you'll do longbear map maker action, you'll already lost it.

By the same way, if you are playing a solo Gandalf deck..., White Tower Watchman can trigger his ability?

I was thinking about that when we first heard about the Gandalf hero and I'm going to go with: no.

Actually it says he gains the icons when you play a card from the top of your deck. Doesn´t actually say that Gandalf has to pay anything; it is the act of playing the card that is enough to trigger his ability.

Though, as you say, he looses the icons immediately so the difference in this instance is minuscule.
