Hi, ive played the

## 2 [monk on October 12, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91975-questions-and-queries/?do=findComment&comment=887445)

Sorry for the above.

ive played twice using same deck on first scenario and have some questions

1. Am i correct when using arragon in that i can commit him to quest, resolve quest then pay resource to ready him? Cant remember other hero name, but after resolving quest he also commited to, can u then use ability to give arragon 1 resource that can be used to ready arragon.

2. Can you play cards at any time. Eg. Can i play Sneak Attack to put ally card in play area after enemies attack but before i attack? If i do this am i also right in thinking that i dont pay the resource cost for ally card but just Sneak Attack card.

3.Snowbourn scout - can i put resource token on any location card, not just the one thats been travelled to?

4. Why would you voluntarily engage enemy before engagement check in solo play?

5. When exhausting Steward of Gondor card to gain 2 resources do you exhaust hero too? Also, if exhausted, can you still use traits on the card (Gondor).

6. Can you play event cards at ANY time (unless stated by card) during the game.

7. At one point in game 2 of my heroes each had Steward of Gondor card that meant i was racking up loads of resources, is this normal?

8. Can you only play ally/attachments during planning phase unless card says otherwise.

9. Lastly, at one point during 1st scenario i had all three heroes, 4 allies in play plus Faramir. During stage 3b of quest card i exhausted Faramir to give all other heroes +1 wisdom for quest phase, plus Arragon had celebrians stone for +2 wisdom. After resolution i placed 10 progress tokens on quest card, exhausted steward of gondor on 2 heroes for 4 resources, then played grim resolve to ready all characters to defeat the enemy (the one mentioned quest card 3b). Is scenario 1 that easy just so you get used to game or was i lucky?

Oh, that's a lot of questions. Let's see:

 

1) No and yes. Aragorn's power is a response which has to be triggered immediatly after he committed to a quest. However, you can use Theodred's reaction to give Aragorn the additional resource, because you can choose in which order you want to resolve Aragorn's and Theodred's reaction. Theodred's response also triggers right after you commit him to the quest.

 

2) Basically yes. You can play event cards that have an action everytime an action window is open. Check the rulebook to see when that is possible (almost all of the time). And yes, you only pay the resource for Sneak Attack to bring that ally into the game.

 

3) Yes, except when the card text says that the location is immune to player card effects.

 

4) To reduce the amount of threat in the staging area. Some enemies have a high threat value but can be easily defeated. When you play with the tactics sphere you basically have to do that, if you want to have a chance to win (don't play with  tactics btw, the sphere doesn't have enough WP to make enough progress in most quests). Also, Legolas gives you additional progress by killing enemies.

 

5) No, you only exhaust Steward of Gondor.

 

6) Like I said before, it depends on the keyword. Actions can be played almost everytime, reactions are triggered by events that are explained on the event card, and they have to be resolved immediatly after the event takes place. Some cards have actions that are limited to certain phases of the game (travel action, combat action etc).

 

7) Lol, no. Steward of Gondor has the unique symbol, so you can only have one of them in play (but you can have multiple copies in your hand).

 

8) Yes.

 

9) You cheated by using two Stewards of Gondor. That's like having two popes. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] However, Steward of Gondor and Grim Resolve are a great combo. The further helps you to spare enough resources to play the latter. And yes, the first quest is meant to be easier than the rest. Be warned that th third quest Escape from dol Guldur is (almost) impossible to win solo. Better play that one two handed.

 

10) i just wanted to add a tenth point to make me feel like Moses. :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

You can't have 2 Stewards of Gondor in play, or in Middle Earth in general :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Yeah, that's what I was thinking about.

 

2x Steward  = not a very happy time for Gondor ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

That was a fun read, and made more fun by being bombarded with the word "pope."  It gets more amusing to say the more you say it.

 

Also, I just really like the line "but he did not die while being pope."
