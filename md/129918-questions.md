## 1 [flipperlord on December 26, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129918-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1381568)

The quests "Conflict at the Carrock" and "The Hills of Emyn Muil" don't have the victory conditions on the quest card (like all the rest of the quests do). So how do I win the quests? I'm not missing a card or two am I?

 

Thanks! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I think they missed the sentence "If the players defeat this stag, they have won the game", but I just assume it's there.

Just an oversight they made in a couple of the earlier adventure packs... they addressed Conflict at he Carrock in the official FAQ, but I never really noticed that the victory text was lacking in HoEM before.  Anyway, for Conflict, just defeat all trolls in play and have 1 progress token on the 2nd quest stage.  For Hills, have 1 progress token on the quest and collect 20 victory points.

Also no Emyn Muil traited locations in play with the HoEM quest before you can be victorious.

yah, so I got a large lot of lotr lcg including mirkwood cycle, both hobbits, KD, a few dwarrowdelf, massing and laketown and I really thought the guy had left out the second card on HoEM because it didn't say "if you defeat this stage, the players have won the game" but then I went and checked my trusty lotr lcg database and figured it out.

Fancy all this time I thought I'd beaten these quests years ago... but having never applied the errata I haven't until now!

Wait which errata are you referring to Rapier, just that no Emyn Muil locations can be in play to win Hills or what?

That confused me too. The Emyn Muil thing wasn't even an errata, it's on the original card.  The FAQ simply clarified that stage 2 is indeed the final stage of Conflict at the Carrock (it was a FAQ entry, and not under 'errata'). So the victory conditions haven't changed or anything... did you play something differently?
