# [Resource phase actions](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86447-resource-phase-actions/)

## 1 [Phil43 on July 16, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86447-resource-phase-actions/?do=findComment&comment=815278)

Can I use Beravor's ability during the resource phase to draw two extra cards? 

 

If I draw Gandalf's Search can I then also use that during the resource phase so that I can play the card chosen during the planning phase.

 

Likewise, can I use Gandalf's search at any time (eg in the combat phase, just after the shadow card has been allocated) and then use the card in the same action phase.

 

I am guessing that I can.

 

Sorry for all of the questions, but as a solo player it is hard when you can't talk things through.

I do try and search the FAQ's and forums.

 

The forum is very helpful and much appreciated.

 

Phil

they are both action type abilities, so you can use them in any green window in the timesheet in the back of the rule book.

in answer to your question- yes you can in the resource phase as there is a green window before planning phase, so you can draw, then play attatchments etc in the next phase.

 

you can also after the shadow cards as there is also a green window there. given you are still in a green window you can also play any event actions you draw...assuming you can pay for them etc.

There also is an action window right after refreshing just before the round ends, which i have not noticed for a long time. This window is very useful, for example to play "word of command" with an unexhausted Gandalf.

yes- this is the phase where you use peace and thought (and amazing card by the way) and strider

All tap effects should be played in this window if you have the choice. Glowine, Beravor, Denathor, Gildor etc etc etc the list goes on.  It is a basic rule of card game, right up there with "do not show your opponent your hand" for obviousness.

Nah they should be played in the last action window in the combat phase, if still available.

Why would you have Denethor exhausted all through the next game-round if there are plenty of enemies on the board? He makes a decent enough defender and with Burning Brand even moreso.

Gildor has a pretty decent quest-power. Especially if you´ve just been using him to exchange cards anyway.

Gleowine could be used as a chump blocker if the stakes where high enough.

Beravor is pretty good all-rounder (though granted I´d probably use her for card draw primarily).

The list of exceptions goes on.

Sure you also have a small risk it will bite you in the ass but in the end, I´d rather have a few options open to me rather than set them on auto-use asap.

Yeah, I always use effects that require exhausting right before I refresh... That way, I get the ability, and get to use them next round. I'm not quite understanding what everyone is talking about with using effects in the Refresh Phase... (Other than Peace, and Thought, which of course can only be used in that phase...)

um... that is the phase we're was talking about... the last action before the end of the turn.

the last action before the end of the entire round is after the refresh phase, so anyone exhausted in this round would remain exhuasted throughout the next round

## 10 [booored on July 20, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86447-resource-phase-actions/?do=findComment&comment=818069)

Before the refresh is the one everyone is talking about. After the refresh is useless. You want to tape the cards at the last possible point so they then untap for the entire next turn, giving you the opportunity to tap them a 2nd time quickly if you need.

Nyck's first post and Rich's second post were both talking about AFTER the refresh phase. Even though this whole thread was originally about resource phase actions. HAHA.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I always get it mixed up as refresh is at the end of the turn. Not that it makes any difference as long as you get your action windows correct. You could call any phase the 1st. But I do tend to forget that technically refresh is the last phase

## 13 [Glaurung on July 21, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86447-resource-phase-actions/?do=findComment&comment=818411)

Different phases have a bit different action window. And refresh phase here really unique.

 

For exampe: most of the time you have a action window before the main action of the phase procure.

Quest phase steps:

1 trigger all begin of the quest phase effect.

2 Action window and so on

But i refresh is different:

1 Refresh all the cards in play raise each player threat by 1 past first player token.

2 Action window.

so if you tap some one, he is out for the next round unless you cannot untap him somehow by the other cards effect.

 

And if your threat is 49 and you waiting for Aragorn Refesh action to reduce your threat you cannot do it cose you add your round threat before you have a chance to use his refresh action.

No - they were talking about the correct phase.  Several other posts were possibly talking about the incorrect phase. 

 

https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/d0/de/d0de4155-2d2a-40dd-820d-f19f7bd75700/lotr_lcg_core_rules_eng_lo-res.pdf [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/d0/de/d0de4155-2d2a-40dd-820d-f19f7bd75700/lotr_lcg_core_rules_eng_lo-res.pdf]

 

If you go to the end of the rule book you will see where it is Red and Green.  Red = no actions, Green = actions allowed.  Each phase has different windows.

7. Refresh Phase

Red - Each player refreshes all cards he controls.

Red - Each player raises his threat by 1.

Red - First player token passes to the next player on the left

Green - Player Actions.

 

Peace and Thought is a Refresh Action - this means you can ONLY use it AFTER cards have refreshed, meaning they will be exhausted all throughout the next phase, unless you have another way to ready them.  Likewise what Nyck was saying

Is that you can play either ally Gandalf, and use him to quest / attack / defend or whatever, and he would then ready before the end of the turn letting you exhaust him again to use Word of Command before he leaves play at the end of turn.

 

What other people are talking about - things like using Beravor and such before the end of the turn are actually talking about using these actions at the end of the 6. Combat phase, as this is the last action window before the character's would ready again.

Holy mackerel shosuko.  Thread's more than 3 years old.  Most of the people involved in the discussion are not even active in the community anymore.
