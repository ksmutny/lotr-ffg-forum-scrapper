As the title says: don't we have any playmats for our game?

Not as a retail product, but as part of promotions and events.

And that really is the only way to get them. It's almost impossible to find them on Ebay. I wish FFG/Asmodee would produce art deck boxes, playmats, etc. for retail.

Yep, it is somewhat strange considering how popular this game is. But maybe LOTR players are not so keen on bling, bling as other card game players???

Here are some unofficial

Which one is the precious?

In my opinion, the one with Eowyn and the Which-King from Seige of Annuminas. (yay, I spelled it correctly!)

I really wish they'd have a few "basic" playmats for sale for us unlucky that are unable to attend any fellowship events.

I think that I have all of the promo playmats that have been released for the game, aside from anything that was Gen-Con specific. I think that my favorite is the Eowyn and Witch King one.

I ask my local gameshop to order me a fellowship event kit, if I’m unable to attend the event.

They even found some Murder at the Prancing Pony kits from 2015 in their storage a few weeks back.

No. Way.

That’s pretty cool (about MatPP).
