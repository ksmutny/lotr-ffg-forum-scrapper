Will FFG offer a list of stores hosting the fellowship night event? 

Or does anyone know of another source with this info?

I don't think any local stores are hosting near me, so was curious to find what the next closest location would be.

Where are you from? It would be cool to see a list of locations that are hosting it for all those who want to attend so I second your question: is there a source for that? All I know is I'm going to the Portland, OR one!!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I emailed the event coordinator at Card Kingdom in Seattle, but never heard back.  Maybe if you email him too we can get an event set up.  The email address is: events [at] cardkingdom [dot] com.

 

Edit: Looks like the deadline for retailers to apply has passed.  Hopefully someone in the area hosts an event.  Let me know if you hear anything.
