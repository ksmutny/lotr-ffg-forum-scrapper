I think I'm doing this correctly but wanted to check -- when you exhaust Faramir to use his action for the Quest phase, he cannot also be counted as part of this quest can he?  I'd like to sneak in two (three if he gets to use his own bonus) more WIllpower points but don't think its legal....

You're right, if you exhaust him for his ability, he won't be able to exhaust to commit to the quest.  However, if you use a card like Ever Vigilant to ready him, you can commit him, or what's better: you can exhaust him again and use his ability a second time, giving everyone +2 willpower instead!

Wow -- that would be a great way to get thru Anduin quickly -- thanks for the tip!
