I actually really like this picture of Legolas, I think I like it even better than Orlando Bloom's look. I'm all about a dark haired Legolas. In a way this picture looks less effeminate than a blonde Legolas. This Legolas looks like he's been hunting for weeks in the forests of Mirkwood. Bad ass. Just because he's got clear skin doesn't make him a woman!

## 11 [Toqtamish on March 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442261)

Anything is an improvement over those movies and Orlando Bloom.

Woah, you DIDN'T like the movies!?! I'm just shocked, I don't think I've ever met someone who didn't like them. You are definitely entitled to your opinion though sir. no disrespect.

## 13 [Toqtamish on March 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442270)

A number of things about the movies really bothered me. I still own them and have seen them several times and even saw the 1st one in theatre 3 times and the 3rd one twice. I even watched all 3 extended versions in one day. But they still really bother me. I would love to see someone do them right.

## 14 [SuperKalelJorson7 on March 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442351)

I was kind of on the fence with this one. Not that I thought it looked bad, just that where would it fit in my game budget when there is SOOOO much I want to get. The video makes me want the game badly, so it did it's job.

I am continually impressed by how first class FFG has become. Their website is the best in the business.

 

## 15 [Toqtamish on March 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442362)

For sure, all the game videos are top notch high quality stuff. I learned the Warhammer game just from the videos. I love whoever they get to do the voice overs. I also like how they are all very consistent between the LCG's. I almost got into Call of Cthulhu too after watching that video and I had no interest in it lol.

I'm shocked someone is surprised about that gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

One of the members in my Earthdawn RPG group is such a 'hardcore' Tolkien fan who cannot find a single thing he liked about the movies. If you start mentioning the movies he'll start a tirade and won't stop ranting for hours - if you let him. He ******* and moans endlesslessly about minute details that 'haven't been done right' or represent 'changes from the novels'.

It's a good thing to remember that 'fan' is an abbreviation of 'fanatic'. Sometimes, it is impossible to reason with a fan, like pointing out that different media require a different treatment of the source material. I'm dreading the thought of having to watch a movie made by such a hardcore fan ... serio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/serio.gif]

I've seen the very same behaviour on this forum. Didn't you notice the posts of people being worried about the introduction of characters from a different timeline or even worse of characters that have no mention in the novels? Some are even worried about using heroes in a game that never met in the novels or carrying items they never had in the novels, etc.

My advice in such cases would be: Listen to these fans and then either ignore them or do the opposite of what they propose if you want your licensed product to succeed. Because, much to the chagrin of the hardcore fans, they're a small minority. It's the masses of people not totally opposed to anything related to fantasy in the widest sense you'll want your product to appeal to.

Luckily Peter Jackson understood this, and I'm sure FFG understands this too.

This is a subject wich needs many hours to discuss and my English are very poor to explain.The only think i can say and one reason i am happy about the movies is that kids now know that the father of fantasy elves ,dwarfs,orcs, trolls etc is not Blizzard but Tolkien.

And i forgot to say that they left Thorin out of this game and they changed Legolas card.The old card had Legolas with blond hair and the new one with dark.That means FFG wants Tolkien fans happy and they try to be as accurate as they can.

That's good - becouse the game is specialy made for Tolkien fans not movie. I rather stick to the books and to the movie (those were good but the book are a lot better). Can't wait for the release of this game.

Actually it could also be a licensing issue: FFG would require a different license to publish a game based on material from the movies, i.e. they're not allowed to base the art on the movie characters. I think they'll strife for a different look just to be on the safe side.

## 26 [cootewards on March 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442619)

I'm with Toqtamish. I thought the movies got worse as they went along.

And while the films where clearly successful, that has nothing to do with their artistic quality. I mean look at Avatar and Titanic.

 

Edit: Still the first two video tutorials have been good, and I'm really looking forward to the game.

although the font for this card game is suspiciously similar to the movie font...interesting that.

Or Aragorn falling off the rock, being presumed dead and then found by a horse who wasn't in the books either...

 

Seriously though, I'm glad they changed some bits- I think Return of the King had about 5 or 6 endings as it was, imagine if we'd had another 20 minutes for the Scouring of the Shire

I thought having no scouring was one of the worst ommisions. I mean after 9-12 hours of films not bothering with one of the main themes/points to story seemed a bit silly. To me at least.  Also most of the issue with the 5-6 endings was the stupid fade outs kacjson kept using.

## 30 [Allavandrel on March 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442743)

The 'Under the Shadow' card in the video has a card text, which is different from the 'Under the Shadow' card text in the English version of the rules, but similar to the card text in the French version of the rules. This seems a bit weird!

## 31 [Eryx_UK on March 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442747)

I was pleased they cut the Scouring of the Shire from the films. That part of the story is just naff and boring.

## 32 [Kzer-za on March 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442766)

I don't think the Scouring would have worked in movie form. The RotK movie already has the Grey Havens, which is a rather lengthy and unusual denouement for a blockbuster movie. Adding a whole new conflict that late in the movie with the Scouring would take at least 20 more minutes to do properly and would have just broken the patience of the audience besides the really serious book fans. When it comes to pacing, a movie isn't as flexible as a book, for a variety of reasons.

The movies aren't perfect, but I really enjoy them and I think many (though not all) of the changes were understandable. Of course, I'd rather play a game licensed on the books because the movies are just one incomplete interpretation of Tolkien's work. Well, this is still an incomplete one because it excludes The Silmarillion and Unfinished Tales, but you know.

I'm pretty sure Thorin was never officially confirmed for the base set, and I'm certain FFG did not change their minds about including him because someone didn't like it on their forums.

I'm very sure he will show up in an expansion.  They are only adding 1 new hero per small expansions.  (Not sure how many in the deluxe quest packs)

I was lucky and i saw the third part.Dont worry is a short one and just explains how many cards each player draws how you shuffle the decks  and were you put your heroes and tokens.

## 47 [Toqtamish on March 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442969)

Just watched part 3 and what stuck out to me is the black screen at the end which says what the license is.  It looks exactly the same as the license that Cubicle7 has for the One Ring RPG.

This means this game can feature any character, place, item from...

-Hobbit and its appendixes

-LOTR Trilogy and its appendixes

One Ring RPG is also set between the Hobbit and LOTR and will release this fall!

## 49 [Toqtamish on March 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442971)

finally got it to load but had to use my IE instead of firefox to get it.

## 50 [Bohemond2 on March 23, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=442973)

Chrome works as well.  I think it just hates firefox.

PART 4 IS UP NOW AND LOADING.

 

Well after watching that I really like Thalins card and I see Tactics being the most popular sphere at least out of the gates. Its very direct and people like that. Kinda like Stark in Game of Thrones, they are by far the most popular house out of the core set, direct and to the point. Easy to grasp. Tactics reminds me of them.

Kinda like Stark in Game of Thrones, they are by far the most popular house out of the core set, directto the point. Easy to grasp. Tactics reminds me of them.



 I think I'm leaning more towards Lore/Spirit, but I can see the appeal of Tactics.

Remove Denethor and place Galadriel in his place and lore sphere will be my one and only choisegui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif].

 LoreLeadership are lagging behind for me, because of my love of the friendship between GimliLegolas in the books. Plus there's Eowyn, the greatest female in Middle Earth. The other spheres don't have a chance. 

Although I do see the appeal of Glorfindel-Bilbo.

Its a matter of  personal taste.I always play card games, video games etc with characters i like and not characters with the best abilities.If i dont like a character i will not play him even if he /she has the most broken abilities or even if you can have an easy win with him/her.

Gandalf and Galadriel are my 2 favorite characters from Lotr.Gandalf is a neutral ally and we dont know yet about Galadriel.I am ok with any of the 4 spheres from the core set (i can use Gandalf 3 times with any of them ) but spirit sphere will be my first choise.Ofcourse i will try  tactik sphere deck cause sword of Gondolin has an awesome art.

As for what you said about Eowyn i think you mean the greatest female of the race of men cause Eowyn cant match Galadriel's power.

If no characters commit to a quest, your threat total takes the full brunt of the enemy threat strength with no wisdom to mitigate it.  You also make no quest progress.

Unless I have serious problems keeping my deck down to 50 cards, which I don't anticipate happening, I'm definitely running three Gandalf cards every time. He's too strongtoo versatile not to play every chance I get.

I think Luthien would like to have a word with you lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] . Even if we're limiting it to the Third Age, Galadriel can take Eowyn in a catfight. And then there is always Legolas...

part 5 is now up, final video.

## 63 [DrNate on March 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=444086)

 During the engagement part of the fifth tutorial, when the player is engaging Dol Guldor Orcs, a Gimli  card appears to be attached to a Gimli card! In fact, this seems to be the case for the whole video. What is the strategy here?

## 64 [Bohemond2 on March 25, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=444090)

 I can only assume that the second Gimli is some kind of mistakeoversight.  The rules don't seem to allow for anything remotely like attaching a second copy of a hero to himself. 

## 65 [Dam the Man on March 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=444157)

Exhausting Legolas the other way freaked me out. Or maybe there's something to be read between the lines about dwarves going one way, elves going another way gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] .

## 66 [Bohemond2 on March 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=444197)

After rewatching video 4, the card attachedto Gimli sholdbe dwarven Axe.  The second copy of Gimli is most certainly a mistake.

I do have to say, I love that every thread seems to have at least one joke at Legolas' (or Legolarz', as per the video) expense.

## 68 [Dam the Man on March 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=444243)

Art is just asking for it. Though I wasn't kidding about the counterclockwise exhaust freaking me out. You do it one waythe other, but do it consistently that way, you don't go mixing them enfadado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/enfadado.gif] !

## 69 [DrNate on March 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=444330)

In all seriousness, when Legolas exhausts in that video, his attached card stays straight. Is that a rule of the game, that attachments exhaust independantly of the character that they are attached to? I don't know if it makes a difference one way o-r the other, but it might.

## 70 [ClydeCloggie on March 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=444349)

Yes, attachments will exhaust separately. I believe one of the previews had an attachment card on show which said 'exhaust this card to do something good', eh, Steward of Gondor?

 

 

## 71 [DrNate on March 26, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=444406)

Now that you mention it, I do see that. "Exhaust Self Preservation to heal 2 points of damage from attached character." Good thing I still have time to master the subtlties of this game before release.

Maybe someone confused the rules with the AgOT LCG? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

IIRC, in the AgoT LCG you can attach duplicates of a unique character card to the character to provide him with 'extra hit points' or something.

## 73 [Ziemniak9970 on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=445036)

In AGoT if You have unique character with another copy of him/her under when you are force to kill a character from any reson you can drop copy to save him/her from being killed.

## 74 [Bohemond2 on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=445046)

However, since Heroes are not part of your deck in LotR, there is no way you should have two of them

## 75 [Toqtamish on March 28, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44129-video-tutorial/?do=findComment&comment=445050)

Right, it was probably just an error during filming.

The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game fans,

Thank you for your enthusiastic responses to our recent tutorial video!

Our inclusion of a Gimli card attached to another Gimli card was indeed an error, and we are working to correct it. After that, the corrected video will be uploaded.

Thanks again,

Mark Pollard
