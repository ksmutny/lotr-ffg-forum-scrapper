Just noticed something that stired my curiousity. I bought everything up until the first saga pack. Then sold everything. Then I realised I was an idiot and bought everything again. (Didn't loose too much money actually ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ) The new core set had a blue dot on the folio the cards where packed in. As was the case with the Amon Din pack. I thought that since my first core set was a 2010/11 model and my new was a 2012 it might had something to do with the errata. Either that or nothing at all.

But when I look at the eratta I can see some inconsistency. Example. Protector of Lorien still hasn't the "limited to 3 times" text. But when you look at the Nazgûl of Dol Guldur it has the "No attachment can be placed" text.

Anyone remember if Protector was errata'ed later than the Nazgûl? Or has the no attachment text always been there and they just made it clearer in the FAQ?

Nazgul got errata straight away afer core set was release. I think 1 week time.

 

 POL get errata after one year. So you got core set which one was issued after first wave. 

Next wave of core set should also have errata for Beravur and POl

the feb 2013 edition of the core set didn't update any of the errata'd cards, sadly. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

@Glaurung Okay. That's what I suspected. Thanks for clarifying it.

@Dain Now that is really strange. How can the 2012 have errata fixed cards and then the 2013 didn't? Strange indeed. And very confusing.

I've seen the blue dot in every pack I've bought so far. Don't know what it means, but it's been there for long.

Oh, okay. Strange actually when you think about it. All new errata is from non core set cards. They should have gotten all corrected for that edition you mention. Maybe they changed their minds ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] hehe

yeah, i dunno why they haven't fixed the others - but perhaps they were saving it for the newest reprint which seems like it will have the easy mode rings on the cards. we'll just have to wait and see!
