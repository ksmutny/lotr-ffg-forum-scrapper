If I have a trap in the staging area and a guarded card is added to the staging area from either a player or the quest/encounter deck and an enemy is revealed for the guarded cardÂ does the enemy still go on the trap or just the guarded card? Thanks!

It still gets the trap, that's one of the common strategies to deal with Guarded (X) effects actually I would say.
