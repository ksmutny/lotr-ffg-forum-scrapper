# [Horn of Gondor and eliminated players](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59833-horn-of-gondor-and-eliminated-players/)

Would a character with Horn of Gondor attached get a resource point for every character belonging to a newly eliminated player (eliminated by threat or quest  effect fx) or does it not count as the characters leaving play per se but more that the player fades from the equation and nothing he has can be used for such an effect?

Had a 2-player game today where my partner might have gotten 6 or 7 resources if allowed but we didn´t want to cheat.

Any and all thoughts are welcome

Can this lack of replies be caused by... players taking undue advantage of Horn of Gondor by opting to eliminate a co-player? preocupado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/preocupado.gif]

Perhaps being a bit timid on the matter to avoid finding out it can´t be used in such a fashion? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Come on and share your thoughts.

 I believe that it would be triggerable.  I haven't replied because I recently sent the question off to Nate and was hoping to hear back from him so I could tell you all about it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Sadly, that has not yet happened.

I would say that this is not a simple matter of wording, because in the rulebook it says a player 'places' all his cards in his discard pile. 
While this is the exact thing you do when your character dies (i.e. one of the ways of 'leave play'), I cannot say for certain if this game makes uses of such syllogism.

 

If it happened in one of my games, I would say you gain a resource for each character card that leaves play. (yeah, call me powerplayer, I don't care).

 

 

Cheers!

Until we get the official ruling from Nate or FFG, I would have to agree with your play. Don't do it. My thought would be because the eliminated player and all cards in their entirety go into a removed from play state.

"Horn of Gondor" does not in fact say that characters must go to the discard pile in order to add a token, but it does state that they must leave play, not be removed from play. Therefore, I would think about it like in "Journey to Rhosgobel". If you healed "Wilyador" with "Glorfindel" during quest stage two therefore putting "Glorfindel" into a removed from play state due to stage two text, would you add a token for "Horn of Gondor" because of "Glorfindel" being removed from play? And is being removed from play the same as leaving play?

I would be incled to say that yes, remove is leaving play (not THE SAME; one being the specific while the other a general), although I'm not sure this is relevant since the rulebook doesn't say that 'all cards in their entirety go into a remove from play state'. As I said earlier, the rulebook specifies the eliminated player cards are 'place(d) in his discard pile'.

 

Hence the reason why someone asked what would happen if you return a Hero whose player was eliminated via Fortune or Fate.

Then I am kind of feeling like it is a chicken before the egg argument. Which happens first, is the player (and all his cards) eliminated from the game, or do the cards get placed into the discard pile first? I think that with the rules saying that the eliminated players cards go into his discard pile, would imply that in fact the player is already  eliminated from the game before the cards are discarded. This is why I leave it question marked, because this all depends on the opinion of whether eliminated players cards are in fact leaving play, which is why I made the Glorfindel comparison in the first place. I might be inclined to think that in the Glorfindel case you would actually place a token. But on the safe side until the FAQ comes out with an update, I always play as though the answer is no.

The answer is yes.. the card reads

med_horn-of-gondor-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_horn-of-gondor-core.jpg]

"Response: After a character leaves play, add 1 resource to attached hero's pool."

There are allies and heroes.. but they are both CHARACTERS. When a card is talking about BOTH Heroes and Allies then it uses the word character... so ANY affect that triggers on characters, or dose dmg to characters or anything that says characters, is talking about BOTH heroes and allies.

"Leaving Play" means leaving the table.. in play is ON the table... so the discard piles, player hands, victory pile, completed quest piles.. etc etc are ALL leaving play. No matter how they get there, Born Aloft will make a character card leave play, so will it getting killed by a troll or a hazard card.. when a hero leaves the table and goes into the discard pile it is leaving play .. just liek any other card.

I sent a message to the rules team, but I'm still pretty confident in my answer.

I did not bother to read your reply (as you didn't with mine), but I'm waiting for Nate's answer so that we can make it official.
