also interesting to see a lifetracker use of the threat tracker!

 

finally for those who want interesting choices, flight to the ford has them! you can use cards which end the quest easier, but given burdens later on....genius!

From these three adventures it appears that Tom & Goldberry have not found a home in the game.

Here's hoping Bill the Pony will be an ally!  (Or an attachment for Samwise)

## 4 [CaffeineAddict on August 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=832669)

the previews of this set so far look great. Can't wait.

Frodo has an interesting ability. And It'll be interesting to see what morgul attachments there are.

## 5 [player1761766 on August 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=832671)

That idea of using the threat tracker as Frodo's life track is really interesting. Glad to see them mixing up the mechanics again, now give us these epic quests that allow us to go beyond 50, dammit!

 

But seriously, I'm very much looking forward to this. I hope amazon's release date of August 29th holds true for the UK...

## 6 [Pharmboys2013 on August 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=832676)

Really great preview, the quests look like a ton of fun and really emphasize the danger, secrecy, and haste that these chapters in the book had. Having Bill Ferney as an enemy is both appropriate and hilarious. Plus the craziest news is that it'll be avaliable at Gen Con next week!!!!! As if I wasn't disappointed already that I'm not going that's just salt on the wound. If it is released thru their online store at the same time that would be awesome. Getting assault on osgiliath and black riders in the span of like a week would almost be too much excitement for me

## 7 [Cricco on August 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=832690)

just wondering how the Hide mechanics really work, also: can sombody explain me the "an evil wound" card? i cant understand it very well

## 8 [Karlson on August 6, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=832695)

My hunch is that the "Hide" mechanic works similar to the "Locate" test in The Long Dark, in which the players discard their cards until they pass it.

Gildor Inglorion was met in the Old Forrest and he still made it into the game. Maybe there's still a chance for Tom and Goldberry.

Very good preview!! The first quest seems that can get out of control pretty quickly. I like the mechanics of the 2nd quests and it seems that we could see the witck-king with his name not some random "Black RIder" (any thoughts of Khamul will be named properly?). Now the 3rd quest seems a race against the clock and suddenly facing the 9 riders with few rounds seems excellent.

## 15 [DurinIII on August 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=832958)

So excited! Alas, no Goldberry or Tom it seems, but, this still looks great! These cards keep getting more and more beautiful to look at!

I think this preview pretty much confirmed we will not see the Old forest nor Bombadil in this pack, as many had already guessed since the announcement. But I think the real problem with saga expansions and campaign mode is their incompability with the other scenarios. If we had the old forest/barrow downs as a POD or as a regular pack AND we could also make them compatible with the saga expansions and play them as part of the campaign it would be awesome, but I don't think this will be possible.

 

I have a question regarding An Evil Wound. In the preview they say that we will face the same pressure as Frodo did to put on the Ring at Weathertop, but that we're not bound to make the same mistakes if we can. However An Evil Wound is put on the ringbearer on setup to represent the Witch king's stab. So, it appears that in the end it doesn't matter if we're amazing players and play perfectly to avoid the risks of the Ring if Frodo still has to get stabbed no matter what? That kinda sucks. It should have been a burden card so we actually have the option of saving him from the stab.

## 17 [Pharmboys2013 on August 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=833001)

If he doesnt get stabbed than what would you have made the 3rd and final quest?  the whole thing kind of loses its point otherwise.  If the ring is used at weather top we probably will get a burden or some other harmful effect but having him avoid the stab altogether removes the context and importance of that final quest

No way. Gildor is met at the very beggining of The Lord of the Ring, in the woods of the Shire, before the hobbits reach The Old Forest as a way out of the Shire.

There's no logic in that we shouldn't see Tom and Goldberry if the story doesn't move through the Old Forest. We've seen many player cards that have nothing to do with the story within the pack. And this includes the saga expansion; the Carrock, for instance, doesn't feature in the Hobbit quests, yet we get Beorn as a hero there.

## 21 [Cunir on August 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=833383)

its a shame they couldn't do four quests in this box, rather than 3, because then we could have had the old forest and barrow downs as another quest. it would have been quite a good one too, because isn't that where they picked up their weapons, in the barrow downs? they would have made some nice boon cards. and having old trees and spirits as enemies would have made a nice change, because we haven't seen either of those yet

i believe what ana is saying is that just because we arent going through the old forest it doesnt mean we wont see bombadil. i.e. we dont go to the carrock in the hobbit saga packs but we still get beorn as a hero

 

i hope you are correct on that ana :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Ah, now I get it. Thanks rich. Um, I guess it's true, we could certainly (and hopefully) get a Bombadil ally card in the pack, which would be awesome. What I think I want to see the most though is that if we're not gonna explore the Old Forest and the Barrow Downs as scenarios in this pack, we could have those scenarios in deluxe expansions or whatever and a way to make them compatible with the Campaign, so it doesn't feel like there's a hole in the story (since we cannot use the ringbearer version of frodo and the One Ring in regular scenarios).

i don't (really) want to derail the thread, but i'm really surprised by all the Bombadil love. it's a totally tangential part of the story, kind odd with naked hobbits running around, and really (to me!) doesn't add much to the main story (but, of course, i suppose it adds color to the history of ME).

 

i think FFG really picked the best 3 parts of the first book to create via quests.

 

Bombadil is such a powerful being in ME that I don't really think any card would do him justice - and I'd just as soon not see him in card form - just like I'd prefer to never see a Gandalf hero.

 

i'm the reverse - i'd not have been pleased if we had a bombadil quest as i think that would have been at expense of the true story/heart of the story of LOTR.

 

with that said, if he is an objective ally for a quest, i suppose that could be okay. but i'm quite fine not seeing him appear in the game. a barrowdowns gencon quest could be cool, though.

Well, to me at least is not really about the Bombadil character itself. It's more about that whole part of the story, with the four hobbits travelling in forests, encountering Old Man Willow, then the foggy plains of the barrow downs and the barrow wights, etc. It's more about the feel of those passages and their adventures which I really enjoyed.

I mean no offense at all, but I always thought this was just a lazy excuse. Iron Crown made a wonderful Bombadil card as well as Decipher, and both captured the flavor within Bombadil's realm (the Old Forest area). It's not like we know what Bombadil is anyway, so the card does not need to be extremely powerful. He can be powerful, sure, but only in certain scenarios or when certain conditions are had, just like in the book.

 

I guess it's understandable they wanted to keep the focus on the Black Riders, but I will be really dissapointed if we don't get a way to play that part of the story in the campaign through a compatible scenario.

 

BTW, I jut finished watching the Druadan Forest playthrough. You guys got really lucky this time!

1) yeah, i've played both the Iron Crown and Decipher games - and I did actually think of that character's cards in those games - but I don't see him fitting in as well in *this* game. either way, it's a rather dull part of the book - for me - so i don't mind it getting chopped. tolkien was a little wordy (and by a little i mean a lot!)  and so, there are going to be lots of things that simply have to be cut for the "highlights."

 

2) yes, we got really lucky. i've never had a game of TDF go quite so smoothly. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Well getting back to the preview, the big thing I noticed was that this Saga Expansion covers only the first half of the Fellowship of the Ring.  That means we are likely going to get five more!  I like that thought, 'cause I like expansions.  But with three new heroes in each expansion, who the heck are we going to get in the later ones?  Gildor Inglorion?  Arwen?  and where the heck is Éomer?  Fatty Bolger would be fun.  I'd love to see Gildor or Haldir as heroes.  What about Allator and Polando as allies or events?

> Well getting back to the preview, the big thing I noticed was that this Saga Expansion covers only the first half of the Fellowship of the Ring.  That means we are likely going to get five more!  I like that thought, 'cause I like expansions.  But with three new heroes in each expansion, who the heck are we going to get in the later ones?  Gildor Inglorion?  Arwen?  and where the heck is Éomer?  Fatty Bolger would be fun.  I'd love to see Gildor or Haldir as heroes.  What about Allator and Polando as allies or events?

 

there are 4 new heroes per saga. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] we just don't know the 4th hobbit yet.

I would think it's safe to say we'll get Rohan heroes (Eowyn, Eomer, etc) in the Two Towers Sagas.

 

Not sure who we'd get in the second half of Fellowship - perhaps new versions of Gimli or Legolas (though, I can't really imagine Gimli in another sphere - but Legolas could maybe be Lore).

 

I'd not doubt a Tactics version of Aragorn at some point, or a Spirit version - he seems the most likely hero to be in all 4 spheres.

 

With all of the Fellowship currently being represented in the game - many of them doubles - I'd think most of the Saga heroes will have to be "minor" characters.

 

I doubt we'll see the other Istari, as they aren't really talked about in the story proper and aren't relevant to the War of the Ring - also not sure if FFG would have the rights to use their names (can't remember if they are named in the Appendix, the main text, or elsewhere - d'oh! - i just remember Peter Jackson not having the legal rights to use the Istari's names in The Hobbit - which is why Gandalf "forgets" their names in the movie. haha.)

 

On Edit: I love the non-humanoid characters - so I'm still hoping for Gwaihir and maybe even an Ent hero! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I wouldn't mind seeing more Beornings, Dalelanders, and lesser known guys.  I doubt we'll see Ent heroes, but I'm pretty sure we'll see Ent allies.  A new version of Radagast would be cool as well.  I'm still holding out for a Gildor Inglorion hero--the ally is practically a hero anyway!  But I'm just saying, if there's five more saga expansions to go, that's 20 more heroes, not to mention the heroes from Against the Shadow.  Are we going to run out of ideas pretty soon?

I also feel as though I am in the minority in not really minding missing out on Bombadil and the barrow downs. Maybe because I was never a fan of that part in the book. I think it was Bombadil'a singing that rubbed me the wrong way cause there was so much of it but I never knew the tune so it was really just lyrics, not music in my imagination.

i have skipped every song/poem in LOTR and The Hobbit. I've also never read the Appendices. I'm a bad fanboy! hahaha.

You should! Its the my favorite part out of the Hobbit and Lord of the Rings books.  I find all that stuff quite interesting.  I also thought it interesting that somewhat around the time of Minis Tirith besieged, King Thuranduil was attacked by Dol Guldur but fought them off after a long hard battle.  And Lorien was besieged 3 times by Dol Guldur but was not taken.  Good stuff.....

## 39 [Rapier1 on August 7, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=833772)

Personally I'm disappointed by them skipping anything. (I felt that each book could have supported 3 saga expansions to make a total of 9, instead of only 2).

It's not because I don't like what they've done, it's because with only limited core content (relative to the length of time I hope this game goes on for) leaving bits out seems bad.

of course they could always release extra saga expansions in the future that fills in missing quests. (by making it an additional saga expansion it can still be designed to work with Frodo). So not getting it now doesn't mean never getting it - I hope they do the same thing with the missing Hobbit quest sections. (Thandril's realm for instance).

 

I do hope we don't get 6 versions of Frodo as a saga hero (I felt like getting 2 copies of saga bilbo was a bit wasteful - although the second one fixed one of my issues with the treasure system). It depends if FFG try to claim that the saga expansions are all stand alone (When obviously they should design them instead to be sequential and expect people to play them in order). The hobbit boxes were designed to be stand alone - but it isn't really. I doubt that anyone bought the second saga box without owning or intending to own the first as well.

With the boons and burdens I feel like they really need to just flat out state that the sagas are designed to work in order, and that the experience of later saga expansions without the early parts won't be as good. (Thereby allowing them to balance on the assumption you've played the previous quests, instead of having to make it work on the assumption you haven't).

bombadil is one of tolkien's finest creations. i urge anyone who hasnt to look at the bombadil enigma (i wrote about it in my tolkienology articles, though it was pretty much the same as everyone else had already written)...an extremely interesting character who has a larger part than what you would initially think in the lord of the rings

I think for the second fellowship box we will see hero versions of the rest of the fellowship, Aragorn, Boromir, Legolas and Gimli, with a new ally (or objective ally/hero) version of Gandalf.

 

I think looking at the saga expansions we have to forget for a moment the history of the game and think of new players, think of the saga expansion as it's own thing. If a new player picks up the next saga expansion only to find obscure heroes instead of the actual heroes from the game I think they'd be very disappointed. Experienced players want to see every character covered, of course, and we will, but for the saga expansions we should be concerned with getting the most accurate LOTR experience we can. That mean's up-to-date heroes who synergise perfectly with the new quests. At the moment it's not even possible to play a tri sphere three hunters deck.

 

And remember the second hobbit box? We all expected gwahir, thuranduil etc, and we got instead the main characters of the story, all tied together in a unified theme (the controlling five dwarves thing.) And like that box, throughout the saga we will also see ally versions of the fellowship members, so in a one or two player game you can get all nine in play.

 

I would also like the cycles that fit in around these releases to mirror the theme of the saga expansions. i.e a shire based one, a lothlorien based one, to fill in any locations or characters we might miss.

 

And Anduril Please. Soon.

That is a very good point sir :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] couldn't agree more. Of cause if you get more than just 3 heroes there would be space for some "obscure" heroes without discourage new players I think. I wouldn't have minded that at all if I was a new player, but I guess it against comes down to what you expect of the game. If you dig the lore I think it would be okay. If you only have seen the movies and just want a strategy game maybe not so much

Exactly this!

 

There’s a lot that can be guessed as we know they’ll follow the books closely.

They’ll also want to add heroes from the parts of the books the saga expansion is based on, as they did in the hobbit and black rider sagas now already.

That said, here’s my wild guess:

 

1st book = Black riders: Sam, Merry, Pippin, Fatty (+Frodo)

+3 quests spoiled.

 

 2nd book = Fellowship: Aragorn(T), Legolas(Lo), Gimli(Le), Boromir(S) (+Frodo) (no Galadriel)

+3 quests from Rivendell to Rauros falls: Ring goes south, Moria, Breaking fellowship.

 

3rd book = Treason of Isengard: Eomer(T), Erkenbrand(Le), Theoden(S), Treebeard(Lo)

+3 quests in Rohan: Fangorn, 3 hunters, Helm’s deep.

 

4rd book = The two towers: Sam(T), Gollum(Lo), Faramir(Le), Mablung/Anborn?(S) (+Frodo)

+3 quests journey to Mordor: Muil/Marshes/Ithilien, Passing Morgul/stairs, Tunnel/Shelob/Tower.

 

5th book = War o/t ring: Eowyn(T), Merry(S), Theoden(Le), Eomer?(Lo)

+3 siege & battle quests: defending M.tirith, battle of P.fields, black gate/last stand.

 

6th book = Return o/t king: Frodo(Le), Sam(S), Maggot(T), & no clue. (+Frodo for 1st 2 scenario’s)

+3 quests: Land of shadow, Mount. Doom, Scouring shire.

Doesn't sound too far off :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] but then again, I'm no lore expert :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] only thing I would rethink would be the Treebead and Gollum heroes.

well, we got beorn in his bear form as a hero...that's sorta non-people-like. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

but i disagree that we will see the same heroes over and over in these sets. that creates too many problems for deck building, pickup games, etc. and it's just not fun to design (i'd think) and doesn't provide much variety. i think we'll probably see hero/ally versions of all 9 between the Core Set and the 6 Sagas (don't forget some are in the Core Set - which is required for play - so they may not feel the need to update those) of the Fellowship but that's it.

 

i'd be awfully disappointed/unhappy if we got 3-4 versions of the same heroes over the course of 6 sagas.

Once the rest of the main characters get their hero card debut, I could see many of the current allies also get their own hero version (just like Faramir has after being only an ally since the core set.)  This, in turn, could add a lot of options for brand new heroes instead of new sphere versions of currently existing ones.  Some options just off the top of my head include Erestor, Gildor, Haldir, Arwen, Elfhelm, Eomund, Damrod, and Forlong.    

 

As much as I'd like to see all nine fellowship members on the board at the same time, I also don't think a hero version of Gandalf would be a hot idea - he would undoubtedly have to be quite powerful (and bear a large threat level,) similar to Elrond, and I would rather just keep having him turn up to 'turn the tide' in my player decks.  On that note, however, I would love to see a Gandalf the White ally in the future!

Oh, that's right. Forgot about him :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I stand corrected.

Hm, that wasn't how I read it the first time but now you mention it and after re-reading it I have to agree with you. There's just no way we'll see more than one version pr. hero in the lotr saga packs. That would be a big waste.

This is why I'm hoping we DON'T get another version of Aragorn (specifically) in the second FoTR saga.  That would make three.  And I think it would be much better to save him for an epic version in the RoTK sagas.

## 53 [Ellareth on August 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=834446)

I know I'm late to the party and people are trying to move on,

but to go back to whole Bombadil/Barrow-Down thing.

 

The most problematic thing about skipping Old Forest bit of story is that it leaves plothole in the story; why didin't Nazguls just overpowered Aragorn and 4 Hobbits and just took the Ring at Weathertop?

 

Not all nine Nazguls were present, and Aragorn did put up a hell of a fight, but without the Burrow-Blades, that scene becomes a huge plot-hole, for Burrow-Blades can be as devastating to Nazguls as Morgul-Blades can be to the mortals.

 

Frodo crying out name of Elbereth and swinging that Arnorian Blade (on top of being a race he never heard of, being an Elf Friend, guided by man of higher race, and the fact Frodo had One Ring in his possession) gave Witch-King doubts and mis-givings and second-gussed himself started thinking what-if these so called 'hobbits' are as mighty as the High Elves or Man of Numenor? That's why he retreated after marking Frodo with Morgul-Blade, take a small victory and retreat before something bad happens to him.

 

However, without Burrow-Blades there is nothing that could harm Nazguls present on Weathertop and no reason for Nazguls to not press on even further after Frodo gets stabbed on the shoulder even with Aragorn putting up a fight.

 

Tom Bombadil and Goldenberry would've made a great Objective Ally, powerful yet costly that could had fun interactions with various song cards we already had,

Old Man Willow and other evil trees would introduce 'evil' trees to the fans of movie, and fighting them could've been an interesting mechanic,

But most of all, Burrow-Blades would've been perfect for the upcoming Campaign Mode and Boon attachments.

Should the Hobbits have nice lunch and sit down for nap or keep riding on to Bree?

How many of your heroes could rally to Frodo before the evil wights of Carn Dum take them?

Will Frodo be able to succesfully rescue his captured friends? Or will he use the One Ring and abandon them, saying there was nothing to do?

 

I mean there were so many choices Frodo had to make in the book, the burrow-down quest would virtually write itself into a campaign scenario.

 

So I would like to respectfully disagree that FFG have picked the 3 of the best events from the first book to be their quests.

Yes the expansion is called the Black Riders, and Old Foreset seems like anomoly, but the blades hobbits aquired at the burrow were essential part of successful defence at Weathertop, fits right into the new boon mechanic, Bombadil would've been no trouble with game's objective ally mechanic, and fan's been hinting they wanted something arcaic for a while; fighting wights from Carn Dum in the old, abandoned tombs of Cardolan sounds very arcaic to me.

i just re-read this chapter this week (going through the books again) and unless i'm a complete fool (which is totally possible!)...this kinda mischaracterizes that chapter.

 

when aragorn knows that the black riders are near he has everyone get near the fire says and has them  hold flaming brands (not burning brands as the card is named!).

 

when frodo puts on the ring, he does stab at the foot of the nazgul but no contact is made.

 

so, the nazgul didn't expect any resistance (aragorn: "there seem to only have been 5 of the enemy. why they were not all here, i don't know;  but i don't think they expected to be resisted") - they thought they would surprise them at weathertop - and were afraid of the fire brands that aragorn was wielding. two of the nazgul halted when frodo took out his sword but the 3rd kept moving forward and stabbed frodo.

 

while it's true the weapons are what merry uses at the end - the weathertop encoutner wasn't really revolving around the weapons the hobbits got at the barrowdowns.

While I agree that it would be better to stick to main characters for these sagas, let's also keep in mind they are supposed to be able to be played in conjunction with the core set. We already have version of Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas from the core.  I do think we will see some newer versions of them in the sagas, of course.  But I would rather see them in the first saga from The Two Towers (in the form of the Three Hunters, with some appropriate hunting synergies), than just another random version just to fill the FoTR saga out.  I think that Gimli and Legolas probably have a better chance of being included at this point than Aragorn, if any of them do get included.

 

However, I DO think that Boromir is a good candidate, even though we've had two version of him now.... simply because both of his versions were added in AP's and not in the core, which falls outside of FFG's intention to make these playable without any AP's.  So I see him as definitely being included in the FoTR saga as a hero prior to the "breaking".  Unless he gets snuck into the Black Riders somehow (which would have us all completely off-guard... hint, hint, FFG!), he pretty much "has to" be in the second saga.  Or we won't have him at all for these.  Which would be heretical.

As for other candidates?  I know based off the Hobbit sagas, we would expect "main" characters, but not many of us expected Beorn.  So I would have no problem seeing FFG include Galadriel/Celeborn in the second saga as a hero.  They did play a pretty important role for a good portion of that book, and in setting the fellowship up for success down the road.  Haldir could even be an outside possibility. 

## 56 [Mr Coffee on August 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=834470)

With all that being said, I guess it's not too early  to speculate on the 2nd saga line-up.  Here's my very unofficial odds-on betting handicaps to be included as heros:

 

Boromir - 1:3

Gimli - 1:8

Legolas - 1:8

Galadriel - 1:15

Celeborn - 1:20

Aragorn - 1:25

Haldir - 1:30

Bombadil is as special as it gets. It hard to argue that. You might not like him (as any character) but he is certainly one of Tolkien's most beloved, or most often mentioned, characters. To not include him, and at the same time have the likes of Elfhelm or Dúnhere (as much as I like them), not to mention Eleanor, Beravor, Mirlonde, is bordering folly.

## 58 [ana4 on August 8, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=834487)

As for the heroes in this saga, the fact remains it is meant to be played with only a core, so Boromir is a given, even though we've seen him twice in expansions. But because we've seen him twice as a hero, I guess next time he will be an ally (probably Tactics), also because he doesn't fit Lore and Spirt that much.

 

Legolas, Gimli, Aragorn, on other hand, already feature in the core set. But there must be some heroes, and it will likely be those that play a big part in the Fellowship, not the likes of Galdor or Círdan.

i'm obviously in the minority on these boards but i simply don't agree. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] there's a reason he's not been included in any LOTR movies (either the cartoon or the live action) - it's largely a pointless chapter written when tolkien wasn't sure what he wanted out of a hobbit sequel (and based on his kid's doll!).

 

on the other hand, for game purposes, characters like elfhelm and dunhere are needed to flesh out the different races of middle earth and to provide variety of characters available from which to build a theme deck - bombadil is not needed to flesh out any race/trait.

 

i'm not arguing that bombadil's not mysterious and opens up a lot of questions as to what he is (it seems like even tolkien didn't really even think that through) but it makes so much more sense to me to have a dunhere than a bombadil, from a pure game design standpoint.

 

edit: with all that said, we still don't know that we won't see him in this saga; we know we don't get a full quest in the barrowdowns but perhaps the locations will pop up, he'll be an ally or an objective ally. all of which i'd be okay with! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I agree with you here.  Each race and faction should be fleshed out in earnest so players can choose a theme and have lots of options.  Gondor is getting all the love right now with the "Against the Shadow" cycle, which is awesome, but through the course of the game the Eagles, Elves, Rohan, Dunedain, and most notably of all - the Dwarves have all been developed to varying degrees.  

When Tom Bombadil enters the picture, however, he is a loner and has no race or faction affiliation to build upon.  Someone in an earlier post also said that no ally card could do him justice since he is considered one of the most powerful characters in Tolkien canon; therefor, I am totally fine with his absence.

 

With that said, I really like the idea of making "The Black Riders" expansion totally Hobbit based in theme to build upon that particular faction.

Just to clarify, I don't think we will or should see multiple versions of the same hero within the saga. I just was concerned that we wouldn't see them at all - in favour of Galadriel, Haldir etc - because we already have existing versions.I just want to see the rest of the fellowship in the next box.

 

I agree the core set versions of these heroes are great, but like I said, I would like to see up to date heroes that synergise together, and with the theme of the quests (as the previewed Hobbits seem to do so well.) As I mentioned earlier it's not even possible to play a tri sphere three hunters deck. I'm sure it's possible to assemble an effective one with the current versions, but it would hardly be one of the best in the game.

 

Having said that, I concur that a Tactics Aragorn would be perfect for ROTK.

to the comments on weathertop plotline: the  reason the nazgul didnt attack further is stated that they knew the company had about a fortnight's hard travelling between them and the ford. they knew the ford was the obvious direction hence an ambush was a good plan which would have worked were it not for glorfindel...who most certainly is powerful enough to take on the nazgul

i dont see any plot mistakes there, apart from some poor leadership choices on behalf of the witchking, who should have realised help would be near so close to rivendell

 

as for bombadil: tolkien's very early draft included bombadil much more actively....theres even a part where the riders are following the hobbits and bombadil turns round and raises a hand- they stop and cannot follow as he has complete power over them. whilst this obvious is completely different, i think bombadil is a perfect choice for a character in this game, as unlike films, plays, computer games etc. this is much more narrative driven

As is notes in an earlier post Bombadil is his own faction. That might not be enough to base a hero on. BUT reading Rich's post I find it natural if he could have his own sphere maybe? Like Bilbo from the Hobbit saga expansion sets. We'd get a really cool character to be a hero, and really go with the lore. Or what do you think?

## 65 [richsabre on August 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=834637)

thats an interesting thought, and one i would love to see happen. unfortunatly though i do not think ffg will want to dedicate so much emphasis on him, if he appears at all, to give him his own sphere

although......it could be a trade off situation. he has his own sphere, his own powers, but by putting in a dedicated 'bombadil' sphere you are essentially watering down your deck with a hero who has little or no player cards he can play. that could make very interesting deck building choices.

 

or another choice, as you say with the bilbo idea, is that he could be a 4th hero, that again allows you to play 4 heroes but at a cost. another problem with this is that we already have a 4th hero with frodo, so you would have 5 heroes in play

I really doubt they will create a separate faction for him, since we already have a separate ring-sphere for the Black Riders, and I anticipate that they will keep that faction going throughout the entire Ring-cycle sagas (FoTR, TTT, and RoTK). To create a 2nd separate sphere for Bombadil would simply be ponderous for the game.

I could definitely see him as an ally, and it would seem to be a fitting spot for him based on his roles in the book. I agree that it would be hard to accurately recreate him and his "power" (undefined as Tolkein left that) in the game, but since he never directly engaged in combat in the books (and seemed to actively avoid it), my thoughts is that he should have a very potent non-combat ability, with no actual ability to directly engage or contribute to combat. Much like The Lord of the Rings Strategy Battle Game, he should be invincible, but with no ability to be damaged or contribute damage. That part is easy enough to do, but what about will-power? He should have a high amount of willpower as well, but not so much that he instantly lets you beat every quest site by himself.... THAT's the hard part of how to convey him to me. Perhaps they could convey his strengths and abilities by either giving him an amazing attack/defense but with a text line that prevents him from attacking/defending, like so:

Tom Bombadil (unique neutral ally), cost - 6

Willpower - 20

Attack - 20

Defense - 20

Health - 1,000,000,000

Limit 1 copy of Tom Bombadil per deck.

Tom Bombadil cannot attack or defend. While he is in play, no enemies may engage any player, and his willpower is reduced by X for every enemy in play, where X is the number of players in the game (X can never be lower than 2). If Tom Bombadil's willpower is ever reduced to 0, remove him from the game. Whenever Tom Bombadil quests, reveal 1 additional card from the enocunter deck.

I wasn't sure how much of a cost to put on a card like that, but really, that ability is good enough that he probably be the first 10-cost ally in the game. I had to add that last "add encounter" line to keep him from being a giant permanent escape card. Especially for a solo player, and any sort of sniper deck (aka Legolas/ranged/Yeow Bow/HOTB/etc/Dunhere), that could just keep enough enemies offf the board to keep Tom's ability indefinitely.

Looking at it again, I'm not sure I really like that build. I had to add that last "add encounter" line to keep him from being a giant permanent escape card. His stat points are useless, and they just sit there as an acknowledgment of their usefulness. So now I'm trying to find a way to represent his powerful stats and NOT have them be useless (and in the process, not have him be a giant escape card that just sits there), as well as represent some of his power in the form of options to the players:

Tom Bombadil (unique nuetral ally), cost - 6

Willpower - X

Attack - X

Defense - X

Health - ∞

Tom Bombadil cannot attack or defend. X is the number of players in the game.

Action: Any player may pay 1 resource to raise X +1 (X may never be lower than 2) for the remainder of this round.

Action: Discard Tom Bombadil to return X number of enemies engaged with any number of players back to the staging area.

Action: Exahaust then Discard Tom Bombadil to deal X amount of damage divided among any number of enemies in play.

 

 

 

I think I like this version of him much better.  Very powerful, but VERY costly in terms of playing him, and also in terms of then using him.

As much as it pains me to refer to anything of Tolkien's as "unimportant", Tom Bombadil is about as close as it gets for me. I tend to agree with Dain on this one. Tolkien had a way of drawing out dialogue, dicriptions, and was just plain.... wordy... at times. Usually, i relish the extra detail (one of the reasons I also love Tom Clancy novels for military/espionage thrills), but I will openly admit to rushing through a lot of the stuff with Tom Bombadil in it. (Sorry, Rich... I know you love ALL things Tolkien lore).... (and don't tell Brownmantle about my admission.... he may disown me as a RL friend... he LOVES Bombadil). I guess I should say that my opinion about the CHARACTER of Bombadil is one of interest, but the actual reading about him gets to be a bit laborious.... and really isn't important to the main story. I think he plays an important role as an unexplained mystical being, and THAT is important in the overall history of Middle Earth to me.

 

Before anyone cries "foul" at Dain and I, keep in mind that Tolkien himself said much the same about Bombadil. In response to a letter from one of his readers, Tolkien described Tom's role in The Lord of the Rings:

 

 

"Tom Bombadil is not an important person — to the narrative. I suppose he has some importance as a 'comment.' I mean, I do not really write like that: he is just an invention (who first appeared in The Oxford Magazine [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oxford_Magazine] about 1933), and he represents something that I feel important, though I would not be prepared to analyse the feeling precisely. I would not, however, have left him in, if he did not have some kind of function."

I think that all this discussion about Bombadil being relevant as a character is quite useless. I'm pretty sure without any doubt that we'll eventually see him in the game, the question is when, and how. After all, he's part of the story, and a very interesting one at that, whether people like him or not. Not seeing him would be like cutting any other character from the game because he/she is unpopular. And considering Caleb Grace and the design team are clearly fans of the books and know every little detail and name from the world of Middle Earth and want to expand on them (that's why I do believe we'll see the Ithryn Luin at some point (copyrights permit), as well as the cultures from Harad and the far east) I think it's a given we'll see Bombadil in the game. Now, whether he'll be an objective, an ally or whatever (I think he'll be both by the time this game is done) is subject to pure baseless speculation. But to me, the (possible) fact that we won't see him in the Black Riders means only that he will be in a future cycle.

@benhanses- i think bombadil to me at least, represents the full stop in the sentence. most of the time you go by and never notice it, and its completely insignificant, but remove it and you lose so much of the story's structure (i rather like that comparison.....).

despite tolkien never really giving the full story on him, i think that remains the one question i would ask....though im pretty sure the answer would be 'i dont know who is is either.'

either way, those two chapters that he features in are two of my favourite, there is something special there that i cant quite describe, that goes beyond the silly poems and nonsense that he sings

i don't think having a discussion on tolkien and the books in a forum about a game based on tolkien's books is usless at all. it's part of the fun and draw of the game, after all.

@Dain: I love talking about Tolkien and the books and lore, but this is a thread about the new Black Riders preview, or rather, about the Black Riders expansion in general. And considering that and the fact that this whole discussion started because we were not really sure whether or not we were going to see Bombadil and the Barrow downs and the Old forest and all that, it makes you feel that posts should be about that. That said, while reading these posts I wasn't sure whether people here were just having byzantine discussions about Bombadil that didn't really matter in the context of the game, or if people just didn't care about the topic and were just derailing the thread further by having interesting conversation about Bombadil. It now seems like it was the latter, contrary to what I believed when I wrote that post. 

 

So yeah, I'm sorry if I sounded rude or anything, and I'm not going to deny I do sometimes comment off-topic, but is it really rude or "holier than thou" to want to stay on topic and expecting people to do the same?

If a new player picks up the next saga expansion only to find obscure heroes instead of the actual heroes from the game I think they'd be very disappointed. Experienced players want to see every character covered, of course, and we will, but for the saga expansions we should be concerned with getting the most accurate LOTR experience we can. That mean's up-to-date heroes who synergise perfectly with the new quests. At the moment it's not even possible to play a tri sphere three hunters deck.

We all expected gwahir, thuranduil etc, and we got instead the main characters of the story, all tied together in a unified theme (the controlling five dwarves thing.)

Who are you callin' non-people? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

In all seriousness, I'm glad that they printed Beorn-in-bear-form as a hero. It makes sense because he single-handedly slew Bolg in the Battle of Five Armies so definitely plays a major part in the story. I'm not so sure about seeing Gollum as a hero, that kinda blurs the lines of what it would mean to be a hero. In terms of the story, Gollum is always an antagonist. Even when he is ingratiating himself to Frodo, it is only to gain his trust so that he can lead Frodo and Sam to Shelob's Lair in Cirith Ungol. He makes a lot more sense to me as an objective, or possibly an ally (with some rather severe limitations).

 

Whether or not they ever print characters like Treebeard or Gwaihir/Landroval as heroes is a very important design question for this game. While these characters definitely had a large impact on the stories, they exist somewhat on the periphery. They are more like agents of power that members of the fellowship (Merry and Pippin for Treebeard, Gandalf in the case of the Eagles) ask for aid. While this seems thematically to place them squarely in the ally category, one of the great things about this game is providing the means to transcend the story. In both cases, these powerful entities are voluntarily bound to a certain region (Fangorn, and the Eyrie), but they both are persuaded, by members of the fellowship, to step outside of these self-imposed boundaries, to help in the War of the Ring. What if they had chosen to do so on other occasions?

 

While I can see the designers choosing to only represent "major" characters as heroes, I would personally really enjoy having hero cards for the more peripheral characters. Being able to create alternate narratives is one the aspects of this game (along with the deep strategy) that really appeals to me.

I also think it's worth noting that in the art for Merry, he is depicted with what is clearly a Barrow-blade, so that shows at least that FFG is aware of them and their relevance in the story. I still think we won't be visiting the Barrow-downs but FFG has been suspiciously silent about the issue, so I guess there's still some hope, at least for having Barrow-blade attachments.

## 77 [Raven1015 on August 9, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87955-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=834779)

Haven't checked in here in a bit and I missed out on some good discussion! So sorry if I retread some ground.

 

I tend to fall on the "Bombadil fan" end of the scale. I actually enjoy those chapters quite a bit. On the other hand, I fully back the decision to cut that content out of the Saga Expansion. This expansion is all about the Black Riders, and I think it's important to maintain the tension of being constantly hounded by Nazgul. Suddenly cutting away to have us deal with Old Man Willow or Barrow-wights would be fun, but would interrupt the thematic flow. In book form it works (in my opinion, I know others disagree!), but in game form with only a few scenarios, I think sticking to the Black Riders theme makes total sense.

 

Bombadil will surely come into the game. I think we'll get an Old Forest or Barrow-downs themed scenario as part of a cycle or expansion at some point. It's nearly a certainty. This is where Bombadil can show up. He'll need to be very powerful but limited in scope or duration. 

 

As far as Tolkien being wordy, it's kind of interesting, but compared to some modern, epic fantasy writers, I actually find Tolkien kind of concise in comparison! In my most recent re-read of LOTR, I was struck by the relative fast pace of the story, again compared to some modern works, and that's including the chapters that can be viewed as extraneous. 

 

(Of course, I have said that the long dialogue of the Council of Elrond is one of my favorite parts of the whole work, so that should give you an idea of my taste.)

i am a bit on the side of not wanting pod packs. they are good for getting content that wouldnt be able to be released normally, but something like this should be in the main packs. i can understand bombadil isnt for everyone, but anyone who has ever interacted with the tolkien fan base should know he is a fan favourite, and i hope the designers recognise that (i will be surprised if they dont as its obvious caleb and the other designers are knowledgeable about tolkien)

Hmm, I know both Dain and Rich are huge Tolkien fans, but I swear I've read it somewhere that burrow-blades did play an important factor when Witch-King decided to delay the chase for the Hobbits.

 

I went back to the source materials and the materials publisehd by Christopher Tolkien, but found nothing to back me up.

After wondering if I was delusional, I went to internet as my last resource and found where I must've gotten the idea Burrow-Blades were important:

 

---------------------------------------------------

"'Escaping a wound that would have been as deadly to him as the Mordor-knife [sic] to Frodo (as was proved in the end), he withdrew and hid for a while, out of doubt and fear both of Aragorn and especially of Frodo.'

 

The excerpt says that his fear of Frodo was a combination of several factors, including Frodo's ability to resist attack at all, his use of an "enchanted sword" (presumably gained after overcoming a Barrow-wight), and his use of the name Elbereth, "a name of terror to the Nazgul" that connected Frodo to the High Elves. Realizing for the first time that this mission to find the Ring "was one of great peril to himself", the Witch-king fled, until "fear of Sauron, and the forces of Sauron's will" drove him back to the hunt. (Unfinished Tales indicates that all versions of "The Hunt for the Ring" were written between the publication of FotR and the completion of RotK, so this passage does reflect Tolkien's belief while writing the story.)"

-------------------------------------------------

 

This is from a random website I found on a google so it does not have much credibility,

but their source seems to be the The Lord of the Rings: Reader's Companion, which is still not very credible as they get some stuff wrong, but the Reader's Companion is using unpublished portion of The Hunt for the Ring as its source, so the ultimate source is the man himself.

 

So yeah.... that's all I have to back myself up about the burrow-blades-are-essential-part-of-plot argument I started.

I guess I just really wanted to see this card game staying as close to the book as possible.

Maybe if Peter Jackson's movie didin't skip The Old forest, I wouldn't be as much outspoken about LotRLCG skipping The Old Forest, feels like part of that part of the book is somehow being forgotten almost.

 

On the sidenote, I do suppose we could always visit Old Forest as part of Adventure Pack Cycle or Print on Demand challenge.

Yes, I have realized that my belifs are not-well founded after I checked my source as they are based on readers companion... I, too, am on the side that generally reader's companions (and atlas) assumes too much.

 

The companion in question is by Hammond and Scull. The first part of (about The Black Rider being afraid of Frodo) seems quote from Tolkien's unpublished essay, but I do not have the book myself so I cannot tell, it might not be
