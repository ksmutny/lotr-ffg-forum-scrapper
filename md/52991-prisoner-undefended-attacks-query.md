If I have only one hero in play, and that hero is captured due to The Necromancer's Tower, that says "... cannot be damaged", what happens with my undefended attacks' damage?


FYI, for the above, I was playing multi-player, so questing and the general flow of the game was still progressing also.

Also ran into a similar thing where I was playing multiplayer and the player with the prisoner lost all his other heroes. The play isn't eliminated from the game right?

No, the player's not eliminated, since he still has a hero in play (captured, but still in play). If you have an undefended attack, the damage has to go to a hero and not to an ally. In this case, you would have to put the damage onto your imprisoned hero, but since he can't take damage, your are very lucky, and nothing happens :-) at least that's how I'd handle this situation.

 The player isn't eliminated.  I think that the undefended attacks just get ignored, in one of the few instances where that's possible.

sounds like a good loophole to take advantage of - you can engage all the particularly nasty enemies, taking them out of the staging area, and your friends ranged characters can take them out at will.

Beware though that the moment you get your hero back you'll gave to deal with everything you've engaged.
