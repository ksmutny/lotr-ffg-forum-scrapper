Recently my small group of gaming friends and I have played through all the arkham horror LCG Arcs (except the one that just finished) and they are really interested in the Lord of the Rings LCG , We played each ark with the pre arranged decks for the investigators on FFG site. Has anyone  made deck lists for each Arc for the lcg  like that? Not looking for amazing decks just ones that use cards from that arc and the core (or all cards through that arc) that when played with 4 players has like a 40-50% chance of beating the scenarios?

The road less travelled (https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/ [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/]) explores each cycle using only core+ that cycle. Those decks are for 1 player, if I understand well you are looking for 3-4 decks to use together.

 

For groups of 3-4 decks that work together, you can check the fellowships on ringsdb (https://ringsdb.com/fellowships [https://ringsdb.com/fellowships]). I don't know if anyone ever posted a fellowship with your restrictions. But nevertheless there is a huge numbe rof decks there. You can also restrict the search to only include packs you want to use.

Hope this helps.
