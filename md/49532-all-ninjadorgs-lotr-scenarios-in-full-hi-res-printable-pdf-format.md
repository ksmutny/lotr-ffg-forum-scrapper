Man! I will print all of them on hi quality laser paper in the next few days at work. Just played the  4th sceanrio yesteday and nearly got killed! Ended it tough with a thread of me 48 and my wife 44. Wow, really close.

We got a Nazgul out in the thrid or fourth round and I could only  beat them by having a hand FULL of allies at the beginning and sacrificing some of them.... :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

We had not Gandalf for him...

Also, I started with a thread of 33 having Aragorn, Glorfindel and Gloin, madness, but fun.

Great challenge!

Thaks again for the effort, I hope more will come!

33??   That's a ballsy opening threat!

Now that the FAQ has clarified Nightmare mode, we gave it a shot tonight and just got our arses repeatedly handed to us.  We ended up going back to the Mirkwood scenario just so we could feel good about ourselves again!

That's some really nice quality stuff there.

Out of interest, is quest 6 supposed to only have 1 side to each card? (Not that I'll be playing it any time soon as I STILL can't get my hands on a hunt for Golum)

## 7 [GeckoTH on July 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49532-all-ninjadorgs-lotr-scenarios-in-full-hi-res-printable-pdf-format/?do=findComment&comment=496639)

 Yeah, Ninjadorg decided to leave out the sepia sides of the cards for Scenario 6. I was thinking about still putting them back to back when I print them up for myself... but seeing as there's an odd number of cards, that'll still leave one with a blank side on the back (not that this matters of course). Still, I was wondering what might make a good card back for Quest Cards... I could do a scan of the Encounter Card back, or perhaps it calls for a new piece of art entirely. Any ideas?

I hate the fact that in the official nightmare mode you are supposed to shuffle back all non-hero card in play and in your hand. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

Doesn't  make sense to me really...but there are some nice variants i saw on the bgg forums regaring "campaign" or "nightmare" mode and I will try some of them soon an report back.

Btw Ninja: We played Ungoliath's Spawn yesterday, the 5th scenario, and I have to say we hated it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

No offence, it made things hard not to be able to play allies and later even attachments, but for us its really a core fun element to play those and in the end we had like 10 allies and attachments each and 100 resources (with steward of condor and Elanor ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ). So, I guess its the late time we played it, but anyway, I hope you don't take it personal. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Sorry you hated the quest mate, hope you at least enjoyed some of the others!

How did you rack up 10 allies (and 100 resources) if you can't play allies?  Did you just stall on stage 1?  And how did you control your threat if you did that?

Also - any suggestions on how to improve when I'm making new scenarios?

Cheers!

Hey Ninja!

Well, we had allies from drawing cards and tons of ressources from Gloin and steward ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The allies were in our hand but we could not play them. We were drawing allies after stage 1, but we had to keep them in our hand. Did we do something wrong?

I would say for this quest, include something like: If you draw an ally or attachment, draw another card or the possiblitlity to swap let says 2 or 3 allies later for the option to draw one card from your deck or so.... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

And maybe make it a bit hard because of that at some other point.

 Gotcha, thanks for the tips mate.  

For what it's worth, we didn't have any of those problems that you seemed to have because so many effects allow you to discard cards to power them.  Guess our decks must look quite different, eh!

## 12 [Iver2 on July 12, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49532-all-ninjadorgs-lotr-scenarios-in-full-hi-res-printable-pdf-format/?do=findComment&comment=498556)

Well, we just have on core, but as we did not look up your quest cards be fore playing and did not think about the thing with discarding ally cards, we neither had Eowen or this lore attachment which would allow you to power up will

Anyway, thanks for taking the "hard" feed back ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Already saw it! Sound really great.

Acctually, I am ordering the Fire and Ice books from Martin now to get into this world be cause I heard the LCG "Game of Thrones" is great. the only "bad" thing is, that its not cooperative, but I still hope to get my wife to play it ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Are there any other good coop LGC's out there? They are more marriage-compatible. I would also take a board game that won't last longer than 2-3 hours max.

One good thing about GoT is also there are tons of expansions out already compared to LOTR ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Not read Martin's books but I'm a sucker for the HBO Game of Thrones series.  And yes, the AGOT LCG looks great - not played it yet but lots of people reckon it's better than LOTR (only not coop) - luckily my mate is on the case and has already ordered his copy so we'll get to try it in due course.

Don't know about coop LCGs, but if you want a great coop boardgame that doesn't take forever try Defenders of the Realm.  It might be heresy mentioning it on the FFG boards since it's from Eagle games but it rocks, and it is from one of the best designers to work with FFG - Richard Launius.

More thoughts on it here if you're interested:

great man, thanks for your reply! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

The game looks great really, will think about it defenitely. The fact that is take only 2 hours or so, would also  make up for the "big" game board, which is just not storable in a kid-safe place at my current small cottage.

 

I am also thinking about the expansions for the the "Lord of the Rings" board coop game. i have the base game but it became quite boring once we managed to beat it quite fast. Expansions seem to expand it greatly from reading comments.

 

Btw: If your are planning your next sceanrio, please make it a really hard one! Harder than Dol Gundor please! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] will loads of progress tokens but please not ally or attachment restrictions ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

cool would be also to adapt the idea from the "helping your friends" scenario to make it a bit easier at the beginning (like drawing more card, getting more ressources or playing allies for free...) and much harder at the end. So far, this is the only scenario which was a clear 2-player defeat for us. Will try it again asap.

Tell me about it – my 18 month old has started wreaking havoc with my gaming plans, no more leaving the board out and all setup overnight!

I love that game, even if it is a ‘Euro’. My friends don’t like it though so I only really get to play it solo. Also, the expansions are increasingly difficult and costly to track down in the UK and I only have the base game (old version).

Yeah, I’m finally catching up with all the cool kids now: little bit of deck building and we started to walk some of the scenarios. Even Dol Guldur became beatable. So we’ll see about the next one because I’ve had quite a few requests for much harder scenarios. I think I saw that ‘Helping Your Friends’ scenario somewhere – do you have the link?

G'day Ninjadorg,

Love your scenarios, awesome work, have managed to beat all up to scenario 5. Which has sliced and diced me considerable.  Is this one possible to beat Solo and with one core deck only?  I am currently using a spirit / leadership combo but each time I'm totally destroyed.

I have managed to get through stage one but from that point on it's all down hill. The latest game yielded me one ally to continue into stage 2 with a couple of lower threat monsters hit the staging area and then engaged and it was good night.

Despite the killing fields still find it enjoyable so thanks for your work.

Thanks for your comments mate.

Scenario 5 is tricky - deliberately so - you have to try and control the situation very early on because things only get harder the further you go.  Some people love it, others hate it.  I only have one core set but have beaten it solo.  Keep at it though - players like Oleg will tell you it's far too easy!

More on their way at my blog soon...

Thanks for your reply ninjadorg, nice to know that it is  beatable solo and with a single core set. I have every intention of keeping at it. As with any of the scenarios it often comes down with the way the cards come out. My last attempt had me with one Ally and too many monsters engaged. The fact Gandalf's map inhibits one attacker/defender  is a real slap in armour.

Again thanks for the great work, hope you keep it up, it has made the game one terrific purchase offering a lot of variety. 

Regards

edmil

 Thanks man, that means a lot.

If you pick up - or have already got - Hunt for Gollum you might want to try my Branching Paths Scenario as it adds more choice to how the scenario progresses depending on how well you're faring or how risky you feel on the way.  Like a mini choose your own adventure!
