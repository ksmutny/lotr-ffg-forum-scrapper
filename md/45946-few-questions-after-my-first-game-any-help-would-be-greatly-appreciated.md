 im not gonna lie to you, i havent scoured the rules from start to finish, i was too eager to get stuck in so i just did a brief run through them as i played. my questions are fairly simple ones,

1/ can you block an attack being made on another player with one of your characters?

2/ when an event says "all characters receive......". is that, all characters you control, all characters from both players or all characters in play that are of the same affinity/colour as the event card played?

3/  can you spend your tokens to use an attachment, but place it on another players character that is a different colour to the attachment itself?
 

thanks for that, other than that....what an AWESOME game!

 oh and one other thing. when doing engagement checks. what is a card has a higher threat level than either player? does it remain in the staging area?

1: If your character has Sentinel. See page 24.

 

2: I assume you are talking about For Gondor! All characters means all characters. It means all Heroes and Allies that every player controls.

 

3: Yes

 

Bonus: It remains in the staging area. You can choose to engage Enemies if you want however. See Player Engagement on page 16.

 thank you so much for that. the one thing i really wasnt sure on was the attachment. i didnt think you would be able to attach a purple sphere to a blue character. but its great that you can. again.....thank you.i officially love this game :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] gonna get my head into deck building now ^^
