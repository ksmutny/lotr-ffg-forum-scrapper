Yeah, me too. They sent me an email on Tuesday telling me that they had it in stock. I ordered it that night and they shipped it on Wednesday. USPS Priority 2-3 days. I'm hoping to get it Friday or Saturday. I expect Redhorn Gate to follow 2-3 weeks later.

My preorder from maelstrom games is still "processing", and I can't find it listed on any of the other usual suspects, either. The UK will have to hang on a while longer yet, methinks

The cards are pretty good. And I hope the artwork is going to awesome as other cards. But mostly I'm looking forward to the quests which look great and can't wait to play them solo and in a pair. 3rd quest looks great and shuffling quest cards is going to be interesting. Other quest are also cool. Probably I will have to wait for a while for this expansion, because I'm from Croatia.

I read over some of your spoilers. I can't find a reference to "Victory Display" in the core rule book, and only a minor reference to it under "nightmare" play on the FAQ. What is the victory display?

is that not just the collection of cards you have beaten that have victory points on them?

The "display" part is a new one on me too, but yes, that's my understanding.

My copy just arrived today and the first thing I noticed was the change in the feel of the cards. It doesn't have that "cardboard, rigged feeling" of the base set + Mirkwood AP cards. It's similar to Osgiliath quality, but not as glossy and washed out (the colors are the same, so no worries there). To me, it feels strudier too and I'm glad for that. The previous card quality was too frail for my tastes, forcing me to sleeve. Keep in mind, the change is subtle; you can't tell which set the card comes from just by looking at it unless you scrutinize it under a light. I'm 100% happy for the change.

I won't go in detail of each of the cards, someone over on BGG has a spoiler thread up, but I do like what I see. The quests are ratings for 3, 5 and 7, so a nice spread there. Nearly every player card is dwarf centric, so being a fan of dwarves I'm ecstatic. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] One thing to note is that one encounter deck is not used at all in any of the new quests, it will be used for future quests in the upcoming AP. So, I'm wondering, why? They could've use that space for more player cards after all. Or is the next AP going to have more player cards to make up for it? Or the is AP's encounter deck really going to be that big? I wonder...

I'm happy with it overall. It's renewed my interest in playing (I've only played Dead Marshes once and haven't even touched Return to Mirkwood... I got some catching up to do).

i might be reading this wrong, but im a bit confused, are you saying the cards are better or worse made? you say sturdier, but then similar to osgiliath which is POD quality.....

This is the best quality right now. Osgiliath was nice, but thinner and glossier as well as the colors being pale, good thing there were no player cards and it was self contained. Khazad feels slighty sturdier (to me at least) than the base game stock, but it's maybe the new coating that's making think that (I'm not about to bend a card to test that theory :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] ).  But that coating does make the card feel smoother and not rough as before. But, as I said before, it's a subtle change. But for the best IMO.
