I was blind-playing The Old Forest today and was hit with a Condition Treachery, quite a nasty business. Later that game, I had a Shadow effect that asked me to discard an attachment I controlled. Clearly, I don't own the Condition, but do I control it?

No, there's a bit about this in the FAQ:

 

 

"(1.06) Control of Non-objective Encounter Cards

Players do not gain control of encounter cards unless
control of the card is explicitly granted by a card
effect. When an encounter card (such as Caught in a
Web, CORE 86) becomes an attachment and attaches
to a character, that character’s controller does not gain
control of the attachment."

To control those would be so cool and easy!  :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

That's what I thought I remembered.
