Apologies in advance, as this is not directly connected to the game, but since I know that the artwork of LOTR is important to many of us, I thought I'd share this link to some great stain-glass LOTR artwork in the general forum:

the moria one is great

its worth checking deviantart often for new ffg pictures as sometimes artists put them up early (and take them back down again gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif])
