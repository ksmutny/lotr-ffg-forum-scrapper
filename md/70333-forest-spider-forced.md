Hello all!

I’ve just bought lord of the ring the card game, read the rules and watched some YouTube episodes of watch it played. My first question on the game is the “Forced” rule on the Forest Spider. Yeah I know, I did not get very far before I ran in to troubles =P

Anyhow the card reads “Forced: After Forest Spider engages a player, it gets +1 attack” so my question is if I decide to engage him first (I think it’s in the 5ed phase) before we do the threat check to see if it engages, do he still get the +1 attack?

yes thats correct- when a card says 'when engages' it also means 'when engaged'

 This is usually followed by "If I engage Hummerhorns, does their Forced effect still trigger?" And yes, yes it does. They are very very evil

Hummerhorns are quite nasty. Last night I successfully beat Escape from Dol Guldur but I had to draw the game out for a few rounds until I could find Gandalf in my deck to deal with the Hummberhorns who were sitting on an objective card. Needless to say, I was pretty pumped to beat that quest solo.

 Hands upon the Bow makes Hummerhorn a piece of cake now !

I haven’t encountered Hummerhorns yet. Though not so strange sense I just recently completed the introduction scenario and haven’t found a way to kill that dame troll in the next scenario yet. And nu you are telling me that it’s some thing ells more evil out there lurking in the shadows! :S

 Well, Hummerhorns only pop up in the first and third core scenarios, and while creative plays can get you out of them they hit hard. I had a very hard time with the troll when I first started, but now (while I still take a beating) I can usually pass  him. Good luck!

Ah that bee thingy, I had only had him as a shadow effect so far. As we in Sweden says “peppar peppar ta i trä!”

PS:
If any one like to try this Swedish ritual of luck bringing you just throw some pepper with your right hand over your left shoulder (or just pretend that you do) wile saying “pepper pepper” and then grab some thing of wood saying “ta i trä”. “Ta i trä” literally means grab some wood, so I guess you cud say that instead. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
