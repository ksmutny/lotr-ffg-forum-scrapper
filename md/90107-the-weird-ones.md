We all love the art of LotR LCG and praise it much, but let's face it.  You look at this many cards, some of them are bound to strike you in an odd way.  Let's celebrate the weird ones.  Here are some of the cards that made me go "Uh?"

 

Dwarven Axe - awesome art, truth be told, but admit it... first time you realized there was a face peering back at you, you about fell out of your seat..

 

Gollum (Dead Marshes - From the alternate-Middle-Earth version in which Gollum was a fish!

 

Resourceful - A Dwarf preparing to skin a.... three-toed sloth?!

 

Dori - I just couldn't figure this one out... is he hunched over? A hunchback? Tied up?  Or just wearing a nice ropey bracelet?

 

 

Which cards made you stop and blink?

Funny topic! There truly are some cards that make you wonder, although the overall art of the game is truly marvelous.

 

As for Dori, I think he is carrying (probably a wounded) somebody on his back. That would make sense in reference to his ability, too. But I admit it is not easy to spot ;-)

 

One of the cards bothering most (since even before the game as released!) is the Core Set Aragorn...he looks like Snape from the Harry Potter movies!

Another one that bothers me: The new Sarumon from the upcoming Voice of Isengard expansion looks (to me) exactly like Gandalf the White in the lotr movies!!

the master of lore blog has covered all of Dori and the art just now!

I didn't even notice until I read his article.

Here's the topic, I won't spoil it:

http://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/dori/ [http://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2013/09/08/dori/]

 

 

As for myself, I really raised an eyebrow at Straight Shot from the 2nd Hobbit expansion.

Arrow right in the eye. Weird art, and I don't like it.

 

The other that comes to mind right away is Forlong from Druadan Forest.

Way more horse then man on that picture. (and it's ugly as well)

Awesome topic!

 

I think the weirdest card art is Pickpocket.

It's not bad art, it's just that Pickpocket looks like a really weird dude...

Dori is carrying (spoiler; see latest Master of Lore post, I think it was 9/8/2013)

 

I always thought that Aragorn (core set) looked like Jay Leno (it's the chin). I don't see the Snape angle.

The flavor text on Dori's card refers to the spoiler that I guess you all are talking about...? (Are we taking spoiler precautions with plotline details from LotR and The Hobbit now?? I'd better be careful what I write...)   Even with that knowledge though it's hard for me to get that image from Mr. "Extreme Closeup" Dori! (edit: I just took a look at the  Master of Lore blog and saw the uncropped artwork --- NOW I get it!)

 

Good call on the pickpocket, Kerstoid, I almost put him in my own list.  He has a very "Igor" vibe.

 

And I think if any of the current hero cards look like their film versions, it's Tactics Boromir!

Things you might not have noticed: Gandalf is standing behind Thorin Oakenshield

 

Ranging Goblin bugs me.  Does he work-out 8 hours a day at the Moria gym and have a zero-fat diet?  And, from the look on his face, I question his ability to use that bow effectively.

 

The Cross-Roads from Blood of Gondor.  I can't decide if I like how the eye is drawn or not.  It's almost like a three-year-old stole the card and drew on it. I guess that's the point? just not sure.  The eye on Evil Crow is depicted much better.

I think tactics Boromir forgot to put his contact lenses in that morning...

 

And it seems like his hair is receding a bit.

Regarding heroes I've always been bothered by tactics Boromir's eyes and Brand son of Bain's facial expression (he looks like he's holding back a fart).  Somewhat unsuprisingly they were done by the same artist...tho his work on Berevor and Thorin were pretty good.

 

Also i've always been critical of lore Bilbo's art.  That hair man...reminds me of a hobbit version of Richard Simmons or Art Garfunkel.

Totally agree with Samwise Gamgee about Tactics Boromir's artwork.  In fact, I think that's the main reason it took me so long to realize what an awesome hero card he was!

 

Strange that the art came from an artist who's also painted some of my favorite cards (like Hand of Castamir).

Haha poor Bilbo. But truely some of my biggest wtf moments come with his and bards art.

But one of my biggest irritations is the just...awful Balin artwork. Would not have cared one whit if it was on an ally but a Hero?

Scraggly far off shot with no detail? Compare to the intricate piece on Gloin which tells a story all on its own! ugh so irritating. Esp since Balin is awesome.

I'm surprised no one has mentioned this one yet, but Erebor Battle Master - what's up with that guy?  That's one of the few allies that I feel totally misses the mark.  He looks more like an angry garden gnome to me!

Just one more thought on Boromir. I think they could release an alternate art card sometime and include it in a Game Night Kit.

Coincidentally, I just happen to think that it's most of the other dwarves that miss the mark. The Erebor Battle-master is, to me, one of the few dwarves that actually look like they could be from a Norse saga or kenning, which were one of the main inspirations for Middle Earth, and not just a guy with a long beard.

Yes! I don't know how to edit existing cards, but please do that with this image: 038_boromir.jpg [http://www.justinsweet.com/GALLERY/DETAIL/038_boromir.jpg]

 

I don't think they would actually make an alternate art version in a special product though, it would be too obvious they did it because people don0t like the art, and that could be a little offensive to the artist, or at least ungrateful.

It's a rather old concept piece by Justin Sweet. I always come across it. You can tell it's a rough version by the rather lazy execution, but even without some finishing touches it would look just fine with the other cards. I think it's an amazing illustration too  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hmm, I like both of these enemy cards.  The Gundabad Archer looks cool to me and kinda cartoony (to match the feel of the Hobbit, perhaps?)  The Fat Spider reminds me of a blood-filled tick who has clung on to its host for far too long!  If they're going for a nasty, gnarly foe, I think they achieved it.

I must say I'm not a supporter of this mentality. One of the few but somewhat big problems I have with this game is how ridiculously seriously it takes itself, and this statement is an example of that. I may not be a big fan of the archer in terms of style, execution and whatnot, but just because its not as melodramatic as most pieces of art in this game is not enough reason to say it's bad. Plus, as Karlson said, it matches the style of the Hobbit.

i dont find the archer bad. my favourite depictions of tolkiens work has always been 'The Hobbit' style pieces. my favourite enemy is probably mountain goblin in the redhorn gate. to me that piece is pretty much exactly what i imagine a goblin to look like.

 

on the general note of 'wierdness' i think it comes about from the fact that this game has varied art and thus varied artists. not every artist can do magali's realism....and that to me is a great thing. i find both types good

 

one type that has never appealed to me though is riversong's style.

This is something I can strongly agree with.  I forgot about Riversong until you mentioned him, Rich; definitely one of the bottom cards for me (he reminds me of someone from Final Fantasy - something I've never cared for.)

I think they are talking about Henamarth Riversong (Core, 60). Karlson I hadn't thought of the Final Fantasy connection, but you are pretty much dead on (to my mind), although I'm not not a fan of FF (I played a few, rather neutral toward the series in general). Is this guy still really popular in deckbuilding or has he been passed over by the AtS cycle?

Riversong is pretty much a no-brainer for inclusion in any solo deck with Lore. 1-cost allies are always playable and this one has a pretty amazing scrying ability, plus potential for contribution to attacks or quests. 

 

As for weirdness: The Battlemaster has already been mentioned, but for me his weirdness is in how he holds his axe. Looks like he's in a rowing boat or something.

 

But the weirdest thing for me is having Eagles in Moria. In fact it's the only thing the game allows me to do that I simply can't go along with. Denethor running through Mirkwood? Aye, why not. Beorn and Eowyn together, sure. But Eagles in Moria, no thanks.

One that popped up the other day:

 

http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1598 [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1598]

 

These guys just look plain weird. Did the artist even check the main discription of an Orc/Goblin before drawing this?

They seem to me something like a crossbreed between a Gizmo-Gremlin and a Gremlin-Gremlin.

Or a mutant alien-ratlike humanoid on steroids maybe? It misses the seriousness of all other art completely imo.

To me this is the weirdest artwork. Not ugly, but weird. No clue how FFG gave this picture green light to be printed.

I just finished a fun bout of deck building and ran into a couple more cards to add to this topic.   

 

First of all - Timely Aid.  I had never really noticed just how BIG that horse was until looking at it closer!  (I've also never ran this card in a deck before so perhaps that's another reason I am just now critiquing it.)

And second - Imladris Stargazer.  Not really a weird card per se, but I've always thought this ally looks just like Scarlett Johansson (with brown hair obviously instead of her normal blonde.)

That's all for now!

Yeah, I can see that.  Although the Stargazer somehow looks more.. stately, I guess.

Woah, I will forever see stargazer as ScarJo now. Not a bad thing... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
