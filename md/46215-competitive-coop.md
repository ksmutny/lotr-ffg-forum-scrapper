This morning one of my friends bought  Warhammer the card game.Me and other six friends we went to his home to play this game and see if it is any good.One ward from my friend's mouth was enough to still  all of our friends from Lotr to Warhammer.COMPETITIVE.The exact wards to were:it's a nice game mate with  maybe a little more interesting game play but Lotr is a coop and Warhammer is a competitive game.So they decided to invest their money on Warhammer and leave Lotr in history.

As for me i thank God that Lotr can be played solo.I know that playing alone is not so fun than with all your friends but what can you do?

Anyone had an experience like this with his friends?

ps:one more time sorry for my English.

Not really.  We have Warhammer and AGOT and we specifically picked this up because it is competitive.  I wouldn't worry too much though.  All three games offer vastly different experiences and are unique in their own right.

I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually play both.

I hope so but i know them 20 years now.They stick on one game until they bored and then they move on.I think i must learn to my girlfriend how she can play Lotr and play with her this gamelengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

All fun is that LOTR LCG is something fresh , that bring new way of fun from this type of card game. For some people cooperative style of playing can be boring but for some dont, can't do anything with that. . Im sure that with expansions LOTR will be just more and more interesting .

Warhammer is a bit looking like a CCG already, especialy part of building perfect decks, playing factions that are know as most effective, some cards are never in decks and stay forever in box becouse compared to others they are useless etc . Typical problems of CCG. Dont get me wrong Warhammer is amazing game.

LOTR just must be something else, and it is. I can play with friends or solo in lonely days having adventures in middleearth without board and throwing dicescorazon.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/corazon.gif]

Warhammer becomes boring fast. And the game is quite broken card wise. I started collecting it when it came out but after the first cycle of packs dumped it for just AGoT. AGoT is a better game for competitive. But I picked up LotR becuz its lord of the rings, and cooperative and I can play it solo when no one else is around like I did 6 times yesterday.

Neither Warhammer or Cthulhu have much of a following here. I enjoy both games a lot. My friend and I played the second Quest today. And barely beat it. We were mentally exhausted afterwards. (We just started yesterday). And then followed it up with aGoT. It's nice playing with someone I'm always playing against. I hope we can sign up as teams in Organized play

I hope this is true Toq.If this is true they will quit from Warhammer and they will come back to me like wet cats partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif].

I must say that what huppend today was an unplesent surprise for me.One game won by far just because it is competitive.

You could explain to them that it would be fairly cheap to play both games. Hell I play all 4 LCGs and generally it only runs me around $50 a month.

## 9 [Carnivean on May 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46215-competitive-coop/?do=findComment&comment=463121)

I also think that people will get a lot out of making a killer co-op deck, one that no matter who you are paired with can drag the poor players out of the mire and on to glory.

If in a tournament you reverse swiss seed, then the best will play with the worst player and to continuing winning the good player will have to be on his game.  That is the part I am looking forward to . . .

Yes this is true but i think the promblem here is not the money.I think they found a gentle way to tell me that they hate coop games and they prefer to play a  competitive game even if it is not so good than a very good coop game.

I can't do anythink about this cause its a matter of personal taste but as i said before that was an unpleasant surprise for me thats why i gave the title competitive>coop to my thread sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

I've got quite a bit of Warhammer and Cthulhu. If you ever want to play, let me know. I'd love to have some opponents. I know Darryl wants to check out Cthulhu pretty badly, though I just taught him LotR tonight. We thought we were doing so good until we hit the second leg of the second quest scenario. We hit on 4 events in a row and wiped out all of my dozen or so characters and all of my heroes, plus I think all but one of his heroes. It was absolutely brutal.

## 12 [Fotonurth on May 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46215-competitive-coop/?do=findComment&comment=463142)

 Brutal. Jayke and I got to the last card in quest 2 tonight, and I had nothing but Aragorn who had 4 wounds on him. We barely got through it thanks to some smart plays. 

I'm interested in Cthluhu, I would have picked it up a long time ago if it weren't for the fact that Meta hasn't had copies in ages. So if you wanna bring it up early one saturday (and warhammer for that matter) I'd love to sit and learn.

If your friends just prefer competitive games, then there isn't much else to say about it.  They aren't going to like LotR as much as just about any other CCG/LCG.  I enjoy Warhammer quite a bit, more than any other CCG I've played, but LotR is an ok change of pace.  I still prefer a competitive game, but LotR is something I can play with my wife, which is a big plus.  I also enjoy deckbuilding, and there just aren't enough options yet in LotR to hold my interest. 

The solo play of LotR should have been a big plus, but I feel like most solo games are just driven by the luck of the encounter deck draw.  Its not like I can just "play better" and beat the scenarios, or tweak my decks until they are good enough.  Even the best decks currently constructed aren't going to beat the 3rd scenario solo without a ton of luck.  This will change with a larger card pool of course, and I can see getting more into solo at that point.

Yes they all told me the same thing.They told me that if in the future FFG will give the option to play LOTR competitive(we know that this will never huppen) we will come back.They love Lotr's lore more than the Warhammer's lore but a coop game can't keep their interest.

## 15 [Entropy42 on May 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46215-competitive-coop/?do=findComment&comment=464133)

There is an existing LOTR CCG that is competitive, if they really love the lore that much.  Its discontinued now, but I think the cards are pretty cheap.  Its not made by FFG though, I think its Decipher?  I take it you just like co-op games though, so this doesn't actually help you.

Yes we know Desipher's Lotr.We play this game since the first day and we still play it but after 10 years of play and as you said  its discontinued now  we all wanted somethink new.

As for me  it's not that i like coop games more than competitive but i like Lotr more than anythinggran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].So the only thing i can do now is to buy Warhammer and  play with my friends wen we meet and wen i am home alone i can play my precious Lotrgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].One good thing is that i like and i know Warhammer lore years before them and i used to play Warhammer miniatures and Warhammer online so its not something new to me.

The bad news are that i must pay for 2 card games nowsad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif].

Just because it's cooperative doesn't mean it couldn't be competitive.  The easiest way I see is to have 2 encounter decks for a 2v2 competition.  1 is shuffled and the other would be mirrored to that deck by a 3rd party so each encounter would basically be the same with the exception of how each team handles their encounter with their deck-dependent play and overall strategy.  You would need to play out of ear-shot of the other team and the 3rd party could officiate.

Just saying.

## 18 [Toqtamish on May 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46215-competitive-coop/?do=findComment&comment=464251)

Could easily compete against each other to see who either solo or in teams can get the better score on the scenarios.

## 19 [Fotonurth on May 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46215-competitive-coop/?do=findComment&comment=464360)

 I still have Decks of Decipher's LOTR somewhere. Such a great game. Their new game "Fight Klub" isn't bad either.

Yes the game mechanics were great.I think is the best  card game i 've ever played.

ps:only thing i did't like was Boromir,Aragorn,Gandalf,Faramir and Galadriel as ringbearers.

 Hey Servant,

 

I got this game specifically because it IS Cooperative.

 

In that way I can lure many people to play. I design decks hand them out and we play!

 

If it was a competitive game, no one wants to play with the the guy who collects it you know? Who wants to be the victim of the Shark.

Not necessarily true, I am the one that collects AGoT and I give out the extra cards I won't use to my friends who also play. LCG's make it a bit easier to get others into games and even multiple ones at the same time as cost is quite a bit better than the traditional ccg/tcg model.

## 23 [Ahzrab on May 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46215-competitive-coop/?do=findComment&comment=464579)

I think Warhammer is the least interesting of the 3 competitive LCG's, though that's just my personal opinion.

The coop modus from Lotr is a fresh idea. Give it a little bit of  time to expand. It can easily co-exist with the other lcg's and can be somewhat successful.
