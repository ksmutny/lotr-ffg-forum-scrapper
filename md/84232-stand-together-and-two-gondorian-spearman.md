Situation: Chieftain of the Pit has engaged the first player and is dealt at shadow card. The first player plays Stand Together and declares that his two Gondorian Spearman shall defend against, Chieftain of the Pit.

Questions:

 1. Can the Response "…deal 1 damage" be made twice (once for each spearman)?
 2. If the two Gondorian Spearman also had Spear of the Citadel, is the Chieftain of the Pit is instantly killed?

1. yes, each response can be triggered once (and only once) for each triggering condition being fulfilled (in this case, the spearman is declared as defender)

2. yes, because totally four damages are dealt to the Chieftain as responses to being declared as defenders)

3. yes, their defense values are added together; however, the damage from the attacker must be assigned to a single defender (as clarified in the FAQ)
