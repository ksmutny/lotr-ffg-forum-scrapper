Has to be played on a Tactics Character but can I play a song of Battle on any charcater to give them the tactics resource or does it have to be a charchter with the printed tactics resource?

Thanks

The card text doesn't say a printed. So a Song of Battle can be used before playing Spear of the Citadel. A the action of Narvi's Belt can be used to give the dwarf hero the tactics resource icon to be able to receive the Spear of the Citadel.

 

That is also the same situation with A Burning Brand and a Song of Wisdom.

Would the character then lose the Spear after the phase ends with Navi belt?

No.

 

Has been rulled in FAQ 1.3 (bold is mine)

 I was going to use this in a dwarf deck and use songs but never thought about Navis Belt. Cheers for help CJM.

Thanks
