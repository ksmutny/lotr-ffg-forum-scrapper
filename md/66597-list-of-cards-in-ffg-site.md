My question is:  Is there any possibility to see the Lord of the Ring: LGC cards in the FFG site?

 

I ask this because we can use the link to cards when they post a news and link them. But do we have a way to see the cards like there is on cardgamedb [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/index.html]?
