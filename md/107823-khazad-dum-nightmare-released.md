In the midst of the criticisms regarding when this cycle will be released this is a very pleasant surprise. The fact that it was released without having to wait months after having a game kit released and that they condensed the quests is really cool. Thumbs up on this one FFG

Oh wow, they are actually out now.... that is really impressive and makes me alot less frustrated about the insane delay for the ring maker cycle.. gonna have to order these today. The art just looks insanely insanely good and the new borders and whatnot on the quest cards looks amazing.

Agreed, the quests are at their best when the encounter set develops it's own combos, something that's harder to generally do outside of nightmare mode since all but one set are normally more straightforward since they end up being used in multiple quests across the cycle

Nightmare decks for my favourite expansion of the whole game? Ordered!

This came out of nowhere and looks awesome!! This is everything Khazad-dum was meant to be: limited use of a torch, high chance of death, swarms of goblins, Balrog attacks! And all 3 are sold together which I think is definitely a good choice for Deluxe boxes. Woohoo! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don't understand; as far as I an tell my local retailer hasn't managed to get in any of the nightmare decks besides the core set.

So are there now 9 others (Khazad + the entire mirkwood cycle) that are out that I can't get locally? Is there a delay on these arriving in the UK or is my local supplier not stocking them?

## 11 [Glaurung on June 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107823-khazad-dum-nightmare-released/?do=findComment&comment=1107283)

Cannot wait to make some videos with that!

These are all print on demand, so generally retailers don't stock them. That doesn't mean that some stores can't if they want, but I think these are generally viewed as "extras", not main retail items for the game. Most of the time, customers have to order them from FFG directly

I got three of the Mirkwood nightmare packs from gameslore, and massing from Amazon, but all the other PODs I've had to order direct from FFG. I did see some of them in Forbidden Planet in Birmingham last week, though.

my FLGS has all of them - maybe you can ask yours to order them?

They definitely are cool! I love the goblin resource thing, but the amount of cave torch hate in Into the Pit is probably my favourite aspect of all three  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

This is where to buy them!  Coolstuff has them for $5.50.  Amazon sells them for about $10 each.....ebay is worse.....In the stores its like $8.... 

 

KD and Long Dark are my most anticipated nightmare decks right now.  Can't wait!  Looks like Into the Pit isn't quite as improved as the others.....we'll see.

Order from Pbay for 27usd. Should get in 2 weeks. Sure will make a Review video + long session with 1 journey for all 3 quests!

Nice! Mine should be arriving in the next few days. Also ordered lake town and nightmare hills, (last packs I don't have) very excited!

If you could take pics of just a couple of the cooler cards and show us that'd be awesome =)

Nw if you can't or don't want to obviously

Sorry for the crappy images but it was the best i could muster (even though my crotch is in two of them), tried not to recycle cards that were already shown in the release post. After looking through I think "into the pit" is going to receive the biggest bump in difficulty, all the new enemies in there are just terrible and that shadow dweller is just insane

This is really exciting. My group has been playing since the beginning, and the release of KD was a really big deal. I am excited to play these!

This was waiting in my mailbox when i got home from work today. After a quick glance through, this looks awesome. I'll be trying it out later, If I have time.

Played Nightmare Into the Pit the other day and I loved it! Khazad-dum are some of my favorite quests, but they are now a bit too easy with the current card pool. It's nice to rumble with all those orcs once more.

Just played my first game against Nightmare Into the Pit....very tense, last second victory at 49 threat (after one threat reset from Aragorn), and with a dead Boromir, who sacrificed himself to kill enough enemies to defeat the new Stage 2B, and with 1 willpower to spare defeating the final stage in an all-out quest.

The last reveal from the encounter deck was a 5-point "dark" location, so I was able to cave-torch & asfaloth double-team it to remove it from staging. Luckily the encounter reveal from exhausting the cave torch wasn't an enemy, as 2 more threat in staging would have turned victory into a loss.

Great game, looking forward to the next two.

Beat into the pit AND seventh level nightmare first go. Both were insanely insanely fun and hard though. Thought nightmare hills would be a walk in the park; lost 3 times and beat it on the 4th.

Have only attempted Lake town and Nightmare Flight from Moria once each, conceded/lost on both..... just couldn't overcome the threat in staging and the nasty encounter cards coming out for Flight.

For the attempt on lake town.... Smaug got multiple SUPER NASTY shadow effects on his first attack of the game during the first round and ate a Gondorian Spearman, Elrohir and Aragorn from one attack...... brutal......

## 34 [Pharmboys2013 on June 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107823-khazad-dum-nightmare-released/?do=findComment&comment=1118632)

I used the classic Thorin, Dain, Ori deck for my playthrough's

 

My first attempt at into the pit was unsuccessful.  An early encounter of patrol sentry harassed me for a few turns before i had no hope of coming back and had to restart.  Having one of them come out early can really mess with your plans to set up especially when cave torch can be necessary early in the game to help with progress before you can build up will power.  I won on my second attempt although my threat was quite high at the end; kept things manageable but a bad encounter draw at any point could have taken me out of it

 

Beat 7th level on the first attempt.  If the staging area is kept under control the orc resource mechanic can stay in check and things dont get too hairy.  I can definitely see this being a lot more difficult the more players that are added although.  The boss is a cool addition but i thought the new quest stage actually made it a bit easier to pass than the one it replaces

 

I've had the hardest time with flight from moria, have tried it 3 times and havent won yet.  The new nightmare cards work surprisingly well (against you) in regards to the finding the right quest stage mechanic.  Will have to try some more, the nature of the quest makes it a little more luck based than others but they difficulty has obviously and appropriately been notched up for this

## 35 [booored on June 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107823-khazad-dum-nightmare-released/?do=findComment&comment=1118675)

the trick to Flight is stability. You want to run a deck that can last for long a long time. Mass resurrections or threat reduction cards and questing power. You want a deck that doesn't care if you do it in 13 turns or 25 turns, in fact to get high win ratio you want to go a little slower to achieve the board presence you need.

I got through Into the Pit and Seventh Level on first attempt - i've played each of these three times, and haven't lost to either yet, though it has been very close, and highly entertaining,

Flight from moria, on the other hand, i've tried three times, and haven't won yet. I'd say this is definitley the hardest of the three nightmare scenarios. One loss was a ridiculous setup - revealed the new surge orc, which then surged into two of the add to victory display/surge treachery cards, followed by the 4-threat/6 quest point location that adds a threat cost to bypassing stages.

Glad to have a quest that i'm struggling with at last. Might be time to try a different deck against it.

Ok i put  my Hands on KD nightmare and i like it. I play all three quest, win all  but is not easy and very exiting! Solo play is one story, I'm pretty sure real power of those quests is coop game. Art is amazing, new mechanics is really cool. Good balanced job. Is not crazy hard but is not easy as well. Really like it!  Will do some videos soon!

## 41 [divinityofnumber on August 2, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107823-khazad-dum-nightmare-released/?do=findComment&comment=1180844)

Finally got to play the Khazad Dum nightmare decks last night. With 3-players, it took us two tries to beat Into the Pit (we had an insanely unlucky series of draws from the encounter deck the first game), but we beat The Seventh Level and Flight from Moria on the first attempt. 

 

I will say that these were the most fun of any Nightmare Decks that we have played. I was a little bit let down that they weren't more difficult. Granted, we did have three players who have all been playing since the very day LoTR LCG was released, have every card ever printed, and play regularly. So, we all know all of the rules exactly, and brought the very best decks that we could think of. 

 

I think that the Khazad Dum nightmare decks are a lot of fun, well worth the money, and are indeed difficult, but I am not sure that they live up to the title "Nightmare."

Yes KD Nmode is really cool! About FFM probably you was lucky first time. Very difficult and interesting quest. Try it one more timr you will see.

Agree here: the best Nightmare pack for now

## 43 [divinityofnumber on August 3, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107823-khazad-dum-nightmare-released/?do=findComment&comment=1181658)

Yes, we were a bit lucky on Flight from Moria, but we also had some good strategy. We flipped the quest card "Pursued by Shadow", while the Nameless Fear had only 1-3 victory points to pump it up. Then, we made sure to hold onto Test of Will until New Devilry popped up. I was running 3x Test of Will and 3x Dwarven Tomb. So, we flipped Pursued by Shadow right after stage 1, and then managed to stay there and stay alive until we won.
