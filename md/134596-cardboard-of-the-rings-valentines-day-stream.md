For our fellow (solo) questers,

If you're alone or otherwise unoccupied on this Valentine's Day eve, come join the magical romp at the CotR twitch stream! 

The usual crew will be joined by special guests Steven (of the WWPD Fellowship), Scott (of First Planet Podcast), and Tom (GeckoTH and general BGG hero). Complete with Valentines-themed decks, chat participation games, a Middle Earth pickup line contest, and a splash of adult beverages, it's sure to be the most romantic thing you do all day related to a card game set in Middle Earth.

The show starts at 8:30pm ET, so be sure to bring your best ME pickup lines to win some LotR swag. As always, come drink alone, together!
