I can't figure this out, the only website I've been to that does it, but any time I try to go to RingsDB I get blue screened on my desktop. It works on my laptop, phone and ipad, but any time I try with the desktop it crashes the computer. I've never seen a webpage do this before. Anyone have a similar idea or have any idea how I can fix it?

 

Hrmm interesting, I downloaded Firefox and it works there, but no in my Google browser, so weird.

It doesn't crash my computer, but it does crash my Chrome brower tab. But only on one computer -- my laptop and my desktop at work load it just fine, it's only my desktop at home that crashes. So I just load the site in Firefox.

It doesn't crash on my phone, but it never loads the deck. I can see the description, but I have to hop on a proper PC to see the actual deck contents.

Ok so sounds like it is a finicky website at best and you need to just figure out what works for you and go with that. Weird, but I am not complaining, great resource to have.
