If I'm honest a little something called Arkham Horror LCG has been getting a lot of my hobby love recently and I want to get back into playing Lord of the Rings again. I was wondering if anyone could give me any advice for strong two-deck hero combos (I was planning to try them against all the scenarios after Heirs of Numenor and most of the POD scenarios so a pair which can work against a variety of scenarios would be preferable).

Try my decks, if you like

All my published fellowships use Dori, so they're probably not what you're looking for.  However, I think there's some nice tribal two-deck synergies out there.

Gondor & Rohan work well together, IMO.  Rohan is spirit heavy, Gondor leadership heady, so they don't compete for cards.  Gondor has some permanent wp/attack buffs with LeBoromir and Visionary Leadership, while SpTheoden can make Rohan cheap and can be a monster with the right attachments.  Mutual Support + a global Rohan buff can be terrifying.  Something like this would work well, I think:

LeBoromir/LeDenethor/LeImrahil && SpMerry/SpTheoden/Eomer.

The classic synergy is between Dunedain and Traps -- nothing powers up Dunedain like Forest Snare does.  Something like this would work well:

Damrod/Beravor/SpBeregond  && Amarthiul/Mablung/TaAragorn

What kind of deck complements a three rings deck?  I think ranged/sentinel combat deck with Brand can work wonders:

Elrond/Gandalf/Galadriel && TaBeregond/TaLegolas/Brand

Gandald combined with Elrond/Vilya is abusively powerful, and Brand's ability to stand up a hero in the other deck means readying Galadriel (for her power) or Elrond (for Vilya) or Gandalf (for Word of Command).

Don't forget the dwarven swarm, or better yet, combine it with mono-tactics.  I'll even combine it with Dori here:

Dain/Bifur/Oin && TaTheoden/Thalin/Dori

Once Dain's deck has five dwarves out, the five remaining heroes can quest for 16 willpower.

For some reason I've never tried a Traps-based Grey COmpany combo (I tended to go with a combo with Elladan and Elrohir) but that definitely has potential.

Hero Arwen & Loragorn is amazing. Make it a Strider deck and only include 3 or 4 big allies - OHaUH Gandalf, Galdor of the Havens, Glorfindel.

I'd like to try that.  Got a list?

Not handy, but it's something like

3x Lords of the Eldar

3x Elven Light

3x Elrond's Counsel

3x Silver Harp

3x Galadhrim's Greeting

3x Gandalf (OHaUH)

3x Galdor of the Havens

3x Glorfindel

3x Strider

3x Unexpected Courage

3x Test of Will

3x Tale of Tinuviel

3x Light of Valinor

3x Wingfoot

3x Elwing's Flight

3x Fair and Periloud

Can't remember what else I put in to fill it to 50. Maybe 1-of Justice Shall Be Done, just for kicks. I don't know how well it'll do solo. I ran it in a 3 player game paired with a Tactics Silvan and a Hobbit/Dunedain deck. It quested well enough for all 3 decks, pulling about 18 per round. With plenty of readying, you'll have Aragorn for defense, Arwen & Gandalf (who doesn't exhaust to quest) for attack (With Fair and Perilous).

I built one of those too:

You'd need to tune it to be more general purpose, but I can attest to the Arwen + Loragorn + OHaUH Gandalf deck being fun.
