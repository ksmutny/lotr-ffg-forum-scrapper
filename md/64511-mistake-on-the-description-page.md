 Gamndalf was previewed with a cost of 6 and was finally printed with a cost of 5 (thankfully).  Greetings :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

if you search google you can find many of these- some actually have cards printed landscape, some with different art/ abilites- very cool

Yes, you're using Unity.

heres some more- note the difference in order of icons, blighted earth, the icon for progress points, thorin who im guessing were going to see soon and the rather orlando bloomish legolas- also note his action- add the top card…….wonder what that was?

That 6-cost Gandalf would've been much less über, especially given his "play G from your hand" trigger on his Response, no more Sneak Attack Gandy bonus. Although discard 1 enemy > 4 dmg.

It mentions the staging area, so my guess is that you had to add the top card of the encounter deck to it. Wonder what that allowed him to do, then. Interesting that the attributes were different too, with willpower at the bottom. One also wonders if Thorin will be much different from this version? At the very least, his threat is low compared to his stats. As for Gandalf, they probably realized that the discard an enemy ability would really detract from the spirit of the game. You could get rid of a Troll, The Watcher or even a Nazgul without having to find ways to really defeat them or keep them at bay. It would have necessitated that they be given the "immune from player card effects" ability to stick around. Gandalf's expensiveness and the inability to use his effect when played with Sneak Attack would have somewhat curbed that, but obviously players would still have saved up for that one big shot.

"spend wound tokens as if they were [resource] tokens" powerful stuff

That does seem really powerful. It's just like Gloin, only spending the resources heals Thorin at the same time.

 Yeah, if they really made a Thorin that good, I would play him in every deck! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, I read the same into his ability. But I'm sure that it was because I've heard about it somewhere before. It's interesting to see the crossover between LCGs. Warhammer has an orc hero with this same ability.
