I did some digging around to see if this topic was posted elsewhere, but I couldn't find anything. Not in the face! ~Cower~

I was wondering how a co-op LCG would/could work in organized play. Any news on this?

And then sure enough, I found it right after I made the above post.

Now, if you'll excuse me.... ~Collects remaining dignity and stubs his toe on the way out~

Â There ARE rules in the rulebook floating around at gencon that explained how tournaments work. Basically it comes down to figuring out who, amongst your players at that game, won the best. Or... who lost the least.
