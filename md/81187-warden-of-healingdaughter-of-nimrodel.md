Well… daughter has worse stats, can only heal heroes and (if I remember) costs 1 more as well. Also more cards work with the Gondor trait. Also she can't pay to un-exhaust.

She's basically awful in comparison.

When the Silvan theme is developed more she may have a use, she has a slim use if you focus on 3 buffed heroes and not many allies, and only one of them is taking hits.
