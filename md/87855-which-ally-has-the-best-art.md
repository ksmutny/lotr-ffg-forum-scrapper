FFG usually pulls out all the stops for their hero portraits, but what about the allies?

 

Thus the question to be answered is which ally has the best art?

taking my male urges aside for a moment, i would say that my favourite ally art has to be the white tower watchman...an amazing and atmospheric piece. of course there are many others who will probably share his top place, i just have that in mind

leadership Faramir? really? not a fan myself.

 

if we're going my sphere than:

 

Tactics: Eagles of the Misty Mountains

 

Leadership: not a lot of obvious choices here suprisingly gonna go with Longbeard Orc Slayer

 

Lore: Ithilien Archer as stated (Gildor in second place)

 

Spirit: Elfhelm (just to be different ha, Arwen is obviously great)

Lore: Gleowine (have u ever seen such a sexy girl? I allways thought he/she was a girl haha)

 

Spirit: Lórien-Guide (Kristina Gehrmanns art is great, you should see her new lore event)

 

Leadership: Denethor (incredible)

 

Tactics: Knight from Minas Tirith (i have to admit, tactic allys are the ugliest in LOTR)

 

 

btw: worst ally-art Forlong

Leadership:  Longbeard Orc Slayer

Lore:  (tie)  Haldir; Erebor Record Keeper

Tactics:  Descendant of Thorondor

Spirit:  Damrod

Nuetral:  Gandalf (core)

 

Erestor is a nice looking card, and it's hard to overlook the contribution to this game that Magali has had, but that card is just too... pretty.  LOS has the perfect look to a dwarven card to me... just a nice, gritty look that doesn't sacrifice a hazy, detailed quality.  Some of the other dwarven cards just come off looking too "cartoonish".  This one is perfect.

 

Perhaps I just like the look of a dwarf done right, but Erebor RK is great for me for a different reason than LOS.  Contrary to the stripped down, hazy, gritty look... ERK has a very dtailed look about it, while still retaining a very dwarven look and feel to me (stone arches, finely crafted clothes and articles).  But it was hard to choose him over Haldir.  Whereas Magali seems to paint the uber-lush portraits of characters with great detail in the faces and "wind-swept" hair a lot, I love that Haldir is heavily-cloaked and that his face is partially covered and obscured.  And instead of filling the card with vibrant colors, Magali limits it to a heavy use of orange and brown, and instead gets great contrast by using a beam of light breaking through the leaves.  This is probably one of my favorites by Magali.

 

Tactics are just the ugliest group of allies out there.  Period.  I do like the DoT becuase it's simple, and shows the overwhelming size of the Eagles 9in comparison to Gandalf standing next to him).  EoTMM is probably better artwork, but I like DoT just for how large it makes the eagles look (same with Vassal... ).

 

Spirit seems to be the opposite for me... so many good-looking allies!!  Arwen, Elfhelm, Ethir Swordsman, stargazer, etc...  Putting aside how "hot" Arwen is, I really wanted to go with Elfhelm, for many of the same reasons I chose Haldir (muted colors, great use of light, etc), but in the end I had to stick with Damrod.  Odd, because he's definitely not as "pretty" as the rest of Magali's work, but there is still a great use of light and subdued colors.  I think I like it because the pic has more "action" than the other choices.  Magali is great at the "epic pose", characters standing there looking beautiful, gazing wisely off into the distance as if they are reading signs from the heavens... lol.  Damrod has a more brutish feel.  He is definitely not as pretty in the face as the others, and he's get his arms around an orc's head, and about to cut its throat with a blade.  Love the promise of violence that is about to happen!

I do believe the new "Knight of Minas Tirith" ally in the upcoming Assault on Osgiliath might be my favorite.

 

I saw him spoiled in this article posted on another thread: http://deckbauer.telfador.net/cards.html&gameid=1&productid=95 [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/cards.html&gameid=1&productid=95]
