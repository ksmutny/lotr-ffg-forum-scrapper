"When Revealed:Â Remove 4 progress tokens from the current quest card. (If there are fewer than 4 progress tokens on the quest, remove all progress tokens from that quest.)"

What does it mean? For example if you have 5 progress tokens on a quest and 3 progress tokens on the active location, than you should remove al 8 tokens? From the active location and the ones from the quest ?

You only remove from the quest, not the active location. There is no rules about remove progress on active location instead of quest.
