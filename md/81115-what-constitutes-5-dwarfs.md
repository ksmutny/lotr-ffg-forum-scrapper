apologies if this has been asked already but I'm sure I read somewhere that your heroes dont count towards any 5 dwarf triggers is this true or have I dreamt it.

I've checked the new FAQ and I can'ty see it mentioned in there.

cheers

A "character" is a hero or an ally.  Either one count.  If a card says you must have 5 Dwarf characters, then any combination of 5 ally or hero cards with the Dwarf trait will count (and the Bombur hero card counts as 2).  Right now, I think all cards that make you count have got text specifying "characters."  But feasibly in the future there could be a card that requires a certain number of Dwarf allies or Dwarf heroes specifically.  Probably not for a long while though, we're all dwarf-ed out!
