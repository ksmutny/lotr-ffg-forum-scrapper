# [Reshuffle encounter deck question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46436-reshuffle-encounter-deck-question/)

This came up in a game today, and I'm not sure if we played it correctly.

2nd quest down the Anduin.  Finished part 2, and moved onto part 3.  One of the rules of part 3 is do not place any new cards into the staging area during subsequent Quest phases.

So, we ended up using the remaining cards in the encounter deck as Shadow cards during the Combat phase.

Question is even though there is no staging of cards, do we still shuffle the encounter deck during the Quest phase, or leave it depleted (and therefore no Shadow cards available for any future Combat phases)?

We played it as no Shadow cards, which let me tell you is such a reflief when deciding on defending or not.  Combat is a lot easier without Shadow cards.

Thanks,

Don

I would think you do reshuffle.  The rulebook just says if the deck is ever empty in the quest phase, then reshuffle it.  The quest card only eleminates the Staging part of the Quest Phase and not the Quest Phase itself.

Yes you would still reshuffle it when you need more encounter deck cards.
