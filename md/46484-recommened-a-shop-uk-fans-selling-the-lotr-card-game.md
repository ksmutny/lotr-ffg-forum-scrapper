May be a helpful resource to UK people, please recommend a shop you know sells Fantasy Flight stuff - especially the LOTR game and the supplies used with it. If the forum lets me, I'll add in posted entries into this first post of the thread, saves people trawling through replies later on.

Whatever details you can get for me to add to the first post would be most useful. 
Looks like I can edit as I need to. Not seen if that is removed after the post has been there a length of time mind.

Hey all,

I used IGUK.CO.UK to order my set.  With P & P it came to about £32 if memory serves. 

The only very minor issue I have was I ordered about 11.46pm on the saturday night for business post which was next day, the site said that any order placed before 12pm would be sent that day so I expected it Tuesday and it arrived on Wed.  I checked the order status and it wasnt depatched until Tuesday.

Good site thou so will use them again.

GamesLore have it for £24.99 plus P&P excellent service.

Cost me £25.17 with Maelstrom, but that was with 2nd class post which took 7 days to arrive (including royal wedding and May Day, admittedly). Nevertheless, very happy with that purchase.

Thanks guys, keep them coming!

I can't re-edit the first post after it has been up a day, so I guess every so often I'll collate what we have into one bigger post on here and then wait for more.

I got my 2nd core set from Green Corridor from ebay.

They are a charity, where the profits on sale go to the charity which seems to me to be really comendable.

Their prices are comparable with the other web stores (Maelstrom being the exception, which do seem to be cheaper generally, but I always find Maelstrom are a little late with getting their products through, which is frustrasting if you want them on the day of release)

They also have a small web site www.gamesknight.org.uk [http://www.gamesknight.org.uk]

I think they are worth a look and I've had good email contact with their staff too

Not heard of Green Corridor before.... Checked out the website - was £28.  Good that the profits are going to charity, but its a bit more expensive.  Gameslore still seem to be the cheapest slightly, and customer service is good.

they also have an online store if you can't make it to the physical shop. but if you are in london it's well worth the visit.

cheers

OGGames.co.uk has the core set available, cheap and free postage and also has the expansion packs on pre-order but with no confirmed release date
