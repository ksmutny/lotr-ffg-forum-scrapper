Ya, the search on these forums is pretty bad as there has been a new thread on this topic every week since it came out :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

There are only two cards for the quest and it is indeed over once you defeat all trolls in play and gain 1 progress token. They forgot to put the bold wording on that set of quest cards.
