I feel really stupid asking this actually, but does Gamling's ability work when a character is killed?  Like if I block with a horse-breeder and she gets owned can I exhaust Gamling to return her to my hand?  Or is he only for stuff like Ride to Ruin and such?

No, he does not work when a character is destroyed. Destroyed characters are not discarded, but "placed in the discard pile", according to the FAQ.

Sure? I ever have thought a character discarded from play is by any way, destroyed or not.

(1.48) Discarding cards vs placing cards in the

discard pile

When a character is destroyed, or an event card is played,

it is placed in the discard pile. This is not the same as

being “discarded.” Cards are only discarded when a card

effect instructs a player to discard a card.

Wow, that's really confusing wording.
