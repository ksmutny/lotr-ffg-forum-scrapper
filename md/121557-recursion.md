Occasionally I find myself thinking of a certain card type, like "encounter deck manipulation" and want to build a deck with cards that have that function.  Then it's pretty much left to me to remember which cards can accomplish that effect-- existing card databases have lots of options, but 'card archetype,' or 'function,' or whatever you want to call it, isn't one that I've seen (many cards would need multiple tags if you tried to make them searchable for this, anyway).

 

Having said that, I was thinking about cards that let you get multiple uses out of other cards, which people often call card 'recursion,' and I'm just trying to come up with a list here.  Started doing this for my own information, but figured I might as well post it for anyone interested.

 

So here I go, please add some if I miss any.  I’m loosely using “pull out of the discard pile” as a definition for “recurring,” even though you may not have actually *used* the card that is being recurred.  I’m listing the recursion function here but not the cost of the card, for the sake of space (this is long enough already!).  I tried not to list cards twice, even though some fit into multiple categories:

 

EVENT Recursion:

Book of Eldacar, Tactics Attachment (play Tactics Event from discard pile)

Hama, Tactics Hero (return a Tactics Event from your discard pile to your hand)

Map of Earnil, Spirit Attachment (play Spirit Event from discard pile)

Scroll of Isildur, Lore Attachment (play Lore Event from discard pile)

Tome of Atanatar, Leadership Attachment (play Leadership Event from discard pile)

 

ATTACHMENT Recursion:

Anborn, Lore Ally (return one Trap Attachment from discard pile to your hand)

Erebor Hammersmith, Lore Ally (return any one player’s top Attachment from discard pile to hand)

Second Breakfast, Leadership Event (each player returns their top Attachment from discard pile to hand)

 

ALLY Recursion:

Caldara, Spirit Hero (put Allies from discard pile into play)

Gwaihir, Tactics Ally (put Eagle Ally into play from discard pile)

Men of the West, Leadership Allies (return X Outland Allies from your discard pile to your hand)

Stand and Fight, Spirit Event (put any player’s non-Neutral Ally into play from discard pile, your control)

To Me! O My Kinsfolk!, Leadership Event (put a Dwarf ally from your discard pile into play)

To the Eyrie, Tactics Event (return a just-destroyed Ally to your hand)

 

HERO Recursion:
Fortune or Fate, Spirit Event (put any discarded hero into play)

Landroval, Tactics Ally (put a destroyed hero immediately back into play)

 

GENERAL Recursion (recurs multiple card types):

Dwarven Tomb, Spirit Event (take any Spirit card from your discard pile into your hand)

Ered Nimrais Prospector, Lore Ally (shuffle one card from your discard pile into your hand)

The White Council, Neutral Event (one player shuffles any card from their discard pile into their deck)

Will of the West, Spirit Event (shuffle entire discard pile into your deck)

 

SELF-Recurring cards (function of card is not “recursion,” but card can recur itself):

Courage Awakened, Spirit Event (willpower boost)

Miruvor, Spirit Attachment (willpower boost, 1 resource, or ready attached hero)

Noiseless Movement, Lore Event (prevent enemy engagement check)

Rumour of the Earth, Lore Event (one card encounter scry)

Swift and Silent, Leadership Event (ready a hero)

 

ENCOUNTER Recursion:

A Watchful Peace, Spirit Event (put just-explored Location on top of Encounter deck)

The End Comes, Neutral Event (shuffle entire discard pile into Encounter deck)

Shadow of the Past, Neutral Event (put top card of discard pile on top of Encounter deck)

 

HONORABLE Mention (card causes you to discard, then play the same card):

A Very Good Tale, Leadership Event (put up to 2 just-discarded Allies into play)

Taking Initiative, Leadership Event (put one just-discarded Ally into play and deal damage, maybe)

Well-Equipped, Neutral Event (put one just-discarded Attachment into play on an eligible Dwarf)

 

ABILITY Recursion (move from play into hand [not discard pile], allowing multiple use of card ability):

Born Aloft, Tactics Attachment (return attached Ally to hand)

Children of the Sea, Spirit Event (willpower boost, then shuffle target Silvan/Noldor Ally into your deck)

Feigned Voices, Leadership Event (prevent enemy attack, return in-play Silvan Ally to your hand)

Meneldor's Flight, Tactics Event (return an in-play Eagle Ally to your hand)

Pursuing the Enemy, Tactics Event (deal damage to enemies, return in-play Silvan Ally to your hand)

Sneak Attack, Leadership Event (put Ally into play and return to hand at end of phase)

The Tree People, Lore Event (return in-play Silvan Ally to your hand, put a searched Silvan Ally into play)

The cool thing about the mono-sphere books (ie, most of the first group) is that they allow you to potentially use the event twice more. The first time when you use the book, and the second once it comes up in your deck again.

 

Add in cards that shuffle, like The White Council (or Timely Aid, or others), and you can play a card a lot more times than you might think. I may or may not have used Sneak Attack a dozen times with Gandalf in a single game this way last week...

It's Will of the West instead of Test. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Nice list, would come in handy sometime.

Whoops, corrected the typo and also added Meneldor's Flight to the 'honorable mention' section.

Gwahir puts an eagle ally, not any ally

Great Post!!

 

A Watchful Peace misses I think, but still very nice to see.

Updated! Thanks for the feedback.  Hard to catch all the details on your own.

Yes, this list is very useful. Incidentally, I plan on adding categories to Hall of Beorn Card Search, I have just been super busy with work lately. If the community doesn't mind compiling lists like these, it will certainly make my life easier when it comes time to categorize the cards. The plan is to allow a card to exist in multiple categories so that Háma would be have the "Recursion" and "Offensive" categories (since his ability relies on him attacking) whereas Elrohir would have "Readying" and "Defensive" and Faramir (Core) would have "Questing" and "Global". The aim is to help with just the kind of deck-building challenges that GrandSpleen is describing, so I would very much like to hear from others what Categories they would like to see (not too many, otherwise they become less useful - they should probably be capped around 30 or so).
