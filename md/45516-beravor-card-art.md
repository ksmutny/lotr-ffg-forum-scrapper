Hello!

Given that now the core set is officially out, I am allowed to show the pieces I've in it that weren't already spoilered.

Here comes Beravor, possibly my personal favorite among the card I painted (what can I say? I love painting good-looking girls). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Beautiful! I really like the setting she's in. Bring on more of the beautiful forest settings!

 Is your deviantART page the one you want me to link to on lotrlcg.com [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=Beravor]? I will be adding links to artists homepages next to their names.

Is Beravor one of the characters from the other FFG game (can't think what it's called)

For some reason, I'd assumed Beravor was a man, and was a bit puzzled when I first saw the card- good to know it's meant to be a woman.

I really like this card, yesterday when I browsed through the characters it catched my eye instantly! Great job, hope to see more of your works in the adventure packs!

Gorgeous art! I love how the softness of the painting gives a kind of storybook feel to the game - wholly appropriate I would say given the subject matter!

Mighty Jim, yes, she is in Middle Earth Quest. At first just reading the name I believed she was a man too.

Faith_Star83, thank you very much, you will.

pwvogt, thank you very much, that's what I hoped, I'm really happy it works.
