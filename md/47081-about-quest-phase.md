Perhaps it's already clear for you, but I have a question for the Quest phase (especially in Solo Mode):

If a player decide not to commit characters in the quest phase, the other two steps (Staging and Quest Resolution) are done or not? If yes, the willpower result equal to zero? So all the threat strength will raise the threat dial?

Thanks in advance.

Yes if you don't commit any of your characters to quest all threat from locations and enemys goes to your threat dial.

and the staging step is still done even if you don't commit anybody.

 esp. in the second scenario.. when you commit nobody... because of upcoming fights... and then the stupid encounter deck presents you with the brown lands.... + 5 threat, jipeeee :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I'm embarassed to say that I'd been playing this wrong!  I didn't realise you still resolved questing regardless.  There goes my Scenario 3 wins! sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]

Playing through again I can still beat Mirkwood and Anduin, but now Escape for Dol Guldor is just ridiculous.
