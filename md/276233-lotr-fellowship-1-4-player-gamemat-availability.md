This playmat looks AWESOME!  And the size is perfect for my table.

Unfortunately, every place I look (including FFG) lists it as "out of stock".

Does anyone know where we can buy it?  Or when FFG is likely to restock it?

I don't know, but I expect it to be awhile; knowing FFG.

It does indeed look nice. Slightly too large for my table, tho', which is 23" x 23".  I think perhaps a table upgrade is in order - it's the reason I've not bought Eldritch Horror yet.

And sorry to piggy-back on your question, but does anyone know the size of the other playmats?  They don't appear to have dimensions listed on the FFG page.

They're about 13'' by 24''.
