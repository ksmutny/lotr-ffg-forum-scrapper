# [Forth Eolingas elaborated](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/)

I got an official response about "Forth Eolingas," which I'll post below for any interested.  Because the card is worded that heroes can "declare attacks," I was curious if that meant they could participate in each other's attacks, how other characters could interact (if at all), etc.  Here's the reply I got:

 

Caleb's response follows:

 

Forth Eorlingas only allows Rohan heroes to attack enemies in the staging area. Non-Rohan characters cannot participate in these attacks, but you may declare any number of Rohan heroes you control as attackers against a single enemy in the staging area. Your friends cannot commit their Rohan heroes to your attack because it's not their attack window. The Ranged keyword does not work during these attacks because the rules for Ranged only apply to enemies engaged with a player.
Hope you enjoy riding down your enemies with the new Rohan player cards!
Cheers,
Caleb

Well that sucks.

Kind of thought it was the other way around.

Greatly diminishes the utility of the card IMO.

Anyway, thanks for pointing it out Danny.

Hama and Theoden are the only one that are great with this event, Theodred and Eowyn should quest and are not that great in combat, Dunhere is better left alone than using this card... so the card suffer from very limited card pool for now.

You can always put Nor I Am a Stranger on Boromir or Aragorn or Glorfindel or Elladan but guys with ranged might be better with great yew bow.

 

Sad news is, it must also be the same ruling for ithilien pit.

The point with Nor Am I a Stranger is fine but what does Great Yew Bow ad to Forth Eorlingas?

 

You can also ad even more characters to the mix with

Seems to me there are ways to take advantage of Forth Eorlingas already

That can't be right....

@noccus : same reason to me... but Caleb might answer something different ?

 

@nerdmeister : I said that great yew bow is better than forth eorlingas if you are playing with ranged character and want to deckbuild to attack the staging area.

Ah ok, that was not entirely clear.

Well yes if you want to deckbuild for attacking the staging area.

If you want to deckbuild for Rohan/Gondor synergy then it is another matter.

Can I read in this that you asked for a ruling?

If not, my take on the pit is that it does work; as the wording is quite different.

It says ANY character. Which I read as "in their own combat turn"

> Can be declared as an attacker against enemies in the staging area this phase.

> Any character may choose attached enemy as the target of an attack.

choosing a target for an attack is part of declaring an attack. Participating in an attack is not mentionned.

Here is the rule :



> 1. Declare target of attack, and declare attackers.
> 
> A player does this by choosing 1 enemy with whom

So if one player declare an attack, he can choose the enemy with ithilien pit and exhaust any number of his characters as attackers, same as Forth Eorlingas.



> Can I read in this that you asked for a ruling?

Well, if my argument fails, then yes.

The difference is that the pit is a attachment, meaning its ability is always active, as it is a passive ability.

Like I said before, any player's characters should be able to attack it in their own attack phase.

I'm confused.  Or maybe foncused.  I think you guys are agreeing with each other.

 

The Forth Eolingas ruling suggests this: if you are able to legally DECLARE an attack with a given character, that character is also able to PARTICIPATE in a declared attack with the same conditions. 

 

(Rohan heroes can participate in staging area attacks with other Rohan heroes via Forth Eolingas, but not non-Rohan heroes).

 

Ithilien Pit says that anyone can attack the enemy with it attached.  So any character can participate in that attack as well.  And it sounds like you both agree on that point--- am I wrong??

## 12 [Noccus on February 28, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100245-forth-eolingas-elaborated/?do=findComment&comment=999154)

After rereading the whole thing, I think you are correct.

Bad communication I assume.

Now I see we both mean that the pit does not allow heroes across the board to pile up on a single attack.

For clarity, here is the point I'm saying should also apply to ithilien pit. Should have focused it...
