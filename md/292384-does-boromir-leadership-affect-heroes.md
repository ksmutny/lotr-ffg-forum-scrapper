Does his ability only give +1 to Gondor ally cards? Or does this affect Heroes with the Gondor trait too?

The text of LeBoromir is quite explicit and says "Gondor allies..." so it only affects allies and not heroes. Contrast it with Visionary Leadership which says "Gondor characters..." which means it affects both allies and heroes with the Gondor trait.

Crazy, that's good to hear about Visionary, but it means you probably don't have to build around the Gondor hero theme, just the allies. Thank you!
