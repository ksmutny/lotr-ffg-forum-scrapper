Is there a way to enlarge images? It's kinda hard to read them from this far, plus sometimes navigation interface obscures card text.

Thank you for the pictures! I swear everytime I see nightmare spoilers I am like: Ok not really nice, but it could be worse and when I get to play one the new card are pure horror :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I don't remeber Chetwood as a very hard quest once you understood what you are up against, so increased difficulty seems reasonable, but I am unsure if I like to forced Recycling of the sidequest just Imaging everytime you finished saving Iaron he gets captured again! Seems unthematic (he's aveteran ranger after all) and annoying. I guess only playing will tell.

 

I have no real memories about the weather hills as it didn't have an outstanding mechanic or seem (except weather...) and I don't really see NM Change that. Yes Cards Focus around damage and healing, but will this make the quest memorable?

 

Really have to say I love the Location artworks <3

 

 

Are you planning on reviewing NM Treason of Saruman, too? Couldn't find any Spoilers for this one, so I would appreciate that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

My pleasure! yeah the location artwork is just ridiculously good, can't get enough of it!
Hmmmmmm I might one day do reviews for Nightmare Saga quests but for the time being it won't be in the near future. I do in fact own nightmare black riders and ring goes south though so I will probably buy NM Treason of Saruman soon and will at least post spoilers if we still don't have them by the time I get my hands on it.

Too few new enemies for my taste :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Dat horde, though.
