Hi all
I would like to ask a question, that maybe silly: at the end of the mission, if won, points are for … what? Increase the scores, you get items?
Thanks!

The final score is just for fun really.  You can use it to compare your player group's performance against the scores of other players.  You could use it to track your own performance on a particular quest over time.  Or you could use it as a way to evaluate the performance of a particular deck.

In tournament play, the final score is how you'll determine the winner of a tournament.
