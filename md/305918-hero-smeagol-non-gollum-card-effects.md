The Gollum side of hero Smeagol says he's immune to "non-Gollum card effects." Since it doesn't say "player card effects," I assume that means no shadow cards (other than Stinker) can affect him, such as increasing his attack? And treacheries that may affect enemies, such as pulling them into staging, cannot move him? Etc?

That is the community consensus, yes.
