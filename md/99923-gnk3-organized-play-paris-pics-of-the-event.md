On Staurday February, 22nd, 14 players came to Troll2Jeux, our hosting shop in Paris to defy Game Night Kit 3.

2 teams out of 4 made it throught the Hills of Emyn Muil. 
All 4 teams made it through the Dead Marshes. 
2 teams out of 4 survived their return to Mirkwood. 

Teams were changing every game so that everybody could have the opportunity to play with the others. 
Ghortagg finished 1rst (On the  background, third from the left, with a ray of light over is face), so he won a playmat, a scenario of his choice and a set of customed tokens. Congrats Ghortagg. 

Hopefully, everyone will be there on June, 1st for our National Event.

Indeed ! Guys in paris succeeded in gathering enough players downtwon and in the suburbs to organize interesting events. 

France is midway between Texas and California in surface area but hosts twice as more inhabitants than California. 
Maybe we'll see between 20 and 30 players at our national event  this year . 

I read you are from Thailand. Does anybody try some organized play where you are ?

Post on Edge Ent [http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_temas.asp?efid=180&efcid=11] and/or SdaJce [http://sdajce.forumactif.org]forum if you want to. Don't know if there is any other lotr lcg community.

You'll have to speak french or make sure to come with a translater though.

Yep, the great thing with this game is that it can be played solo.
The downside of it is that it makes organized play kinda difficult to organize outside large cities. 

 Hey Glaurung ! no problem, Alogos is right, come post on this forum before you come to Paris : http://sdajce.forumactif.org/ [http://sdajce.forumactif.org/].

Many people on this forum read and write English well enough to arrange a meet up.
Let's make it happen and  I'll try my best to be there. 

If your French is a bit rusty, i could even create an account for you if you're ok to share your email with me.
What about creating an  "LOTR LCG : International" thread to make it easy for you guys to come and say Hi ?

This looks awesome! When you said all 4 teams made it through Dead Marshes and on did you guys start with Passage through Mirkwood and keep questing through the cycle? Or did you play scenario by scenario separately? I am interested in stringing multiple quests together but not sure how to set up after one scenario is beat....heal heroes or leave damage...leave allies in play or start all over? Just my random thoughts :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Each table of 3 or 4 was different for each scenario. We had different people in GNK1, 2 and 3 and we brought different deck each GNK (with lastest cards). There was no continuity.

For GNK 1 and 2, as far as I remember (and I do badly), we were forced to have at least 2 hero of one sphere and 3 optional side hero so the table mixing could go smoothly.

For this one, each player anounced in advanced all 3 heroes, so we could deckbuild with 3 different sphere and fixed heroes.

Actually what I would like to know...... Can you tell more about a quests? How is change compare to normal mode?

What do you mean ? Are you looking for more information about the way we oarganize tournaments our would you like precisions about GNKs ?

## 21 [alogos on February 27, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99923-gnk3-organized-play-paris-pics-of-the-event/?do=findComment&comment=997541)

I think he means how is nightmare mode different from normal mode.

 

Well, for some, it balanced them, having less difficulty to get Athelas or Gollum, having less overpowered treacheries. But it mostly add thematic challenge, and sometimes it bring more imbalanced cards... but adding more cards in the deck make them less likely to get them. It is harder, sometimes too much, you have no place for thematic or fun deckbuild if you want a chance.

.yes I mean how is change the difficulty and theme of the quest compare normal mode. I really love Dead marches but since is to easy I never play it... hope now is ok. And Emyn Muil same story. Originally is really easy and boring quest.....

I mostly remember the GNK transforming the scenario into a horror movie. 
The 3 scenarios in the core set become real challenges (I mean, Dol Guldur has always been a challenge anyway). 
The quiet walk through mirkwwod is now haunted by blood thirsty spiders and most illustrations make me think
of irom maiden CD covers.
The Carrock even has its own two headed troll and it's pretty violent. 
It's like Bilbo just moved to Elm Street.

That's odd. I've stayed in Thailand for quite a while. Not much in Krung Thep really, but in Chaing Mai I've found the people very friendly and outgoing with a Farang. And along the coast in the south, and on the islands, it was even common to play games in a bar. Had loads of fun playing Jenga and drinking with locals. So why not try lotr lcg outdoors? The weather is usually fine outside rainy season :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
