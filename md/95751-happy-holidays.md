Merry Christmas to all and may all your shadow cards be blanks! (Unless the attacker is a Warg in which case I hope you have a Burning Brand on the defender.)

I am excited to see where this game goes in the coming year. The design and mechanics are excellent, and I think that it has a long life ahead of it!

Merry Christmas everyone. Hope this year will be very good for LOTR LCG. VOI +saga expansion should bring us amazing experience. Cheers!

Glad to be back in 2014! Have a great New Year everyone. Good to see some old faces and names from when I was last here too including Richsabre, Glaurung, Narsil0420 and Bulroarer!

Yep, us old-timers are still here! I can't believe that this will be three years of playing The Card Game in April!

For myself, it's been three years of waiting for Elves and they're finally showing up! It's going to be a good year!

## 12 [legolas18 on January 10, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95751-happy-holidays/?do=findComment&comment=950517)

Wow! Three years. Wish I had known about it sooner.

i know! i began playing shortly after april '11, myself!

 

three years seems like a long time but when you think about it, we really only get 1 cycle a year which only adds about ~15-18 cards per sphere (not counting sagas) - so not too much!

 

but i think we're finally at a place where we can build a variety of interesting decks - and it's only going to get better with VoI/RM!

I think that is the reason why I love this game so much. I have been around since even before the game was released (although not always active in these forums), but truly, deck-building starts to take off just now. I remember the core set phase, when we just didn't have much options in terms of deckbuilding. I think the Saga Expansions helped boost the player cardpool considerably, and next to the deck-building we also have an abundance of quests to experience. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

 

I wonder though, the competitive LCGs basically consist only of player cards, it seems so overwhelming coming from the lotr lcg now :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Yeah, games like Warhammer Invasion or Star Wars are just overflowing with cards - and I believe Star Wars is the newest one.

By the way, happy 200th post, faith_star83!!!

i would add though, that they have a lot of factions in those games - and if you don't play (or don't like) any particular faction(s) a lot of those cards are "dead" to you - even if they are player cards.
