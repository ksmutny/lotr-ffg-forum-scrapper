Don't know if we already have one of these yet but i saw the Characters you would like to see heroes of thread by CaptainAce so i thought why not make on about scenarios

For me i would like to see

 

Battle of the Fords of Isen(i would reaaaaaaaaaaly like this)

Battle under the trees(that what its called?)

Destruction of Dol Guldor

And  as many have suggested Siege of Erebor

more ithilien would be nice but i don't think were really any other scenarios other than when Frodo and Sam arrive to Ithilien

Sieges of Lothlorien

Taming of Smeagol in Ered Luin, using an Island Map mechanic like we have in the new Temple of the Deceived scenario!

My number one is the Siege of Erebor/Battle of Dale. I'd also like to see the Battle of Bywater and really anything else in the Shire. I'd also like to see a cycle (or more) where they explore the far east like Umbar, Harad, and Rhun.

Cool thread. I'd love to see a scenario where you battle a cold Drake or two. Hopefully as part of a normal cycle, and not a print on demand.

I've been predicting a Northern Rhovanion cycle for a while, it seems ripe for exploration. The Withered Heath, drakes and a final big dragon boss would be so cool.

Yeah I'm really hoping for this. Also, as stated already, a cycle based around the far East would be fantastic.

Rhun would be Fantastic!!:D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Easterlings!

 

 

btw Harad and Umbar are south not East

East and South is my personal favorite setting actually. The Blue Wizards would be so cool, but sadly they're off-limits for FFG. A cycle in the East revolving around them searching for artifacts would be my perfect LOTR cycle, as it deals with both of my favorite themes still not explored in the game.

Do you think they could use the other Dwarf clans in the east? Ironfists, Blacklocks, etc.?

Unless maybe their heroes discard themselves from play for some reason.

As by trait? No, I don't. As by the material for new heroes/allies? Sure, why not.

That's actually not a bad idea. Like a Dwarven Caldara.

Forodwaith. Jouneying through the snow and ice to discover an ancient weapon of Morgoth would be good.

 

How about a final journey where the heroes sail to the undying lands.

 

How about meeting one of the Valar

Not all adventures have to be about journeys or combat either. A couple of other (probably eccentric) ideas:

- Domestic comedy. i.e. A hero is getting married in the Shire and the heroes must overcomes various obstacles such as Bride and Grooms mother disagreeing over the dress. Stupid stuff  but done well might be quite funny

- Learning wisdom. The Victorian writers saw Elfland as somewhere where you gained self-knowledge and Tolkien was influenced to some degree by this (Boromir). You could easily setup an adventure in Lorien where the objective is to gain wisdom.

 

There's bout a billion RPG scenarios out there you could mine for ideas.

The domestic comedy idea would be a great fan scenario!

I like the idea of non-combat:
-search for the Ent-wives?

Other ideas:
- The many wars between Gondor-Umbar could give akind of desert theme.
- Invasion of Gondor (don't remeber when) which ended in the arrival of the Rohirrim

First age stuff:
-The kinslaying by the Noldor
-The journey through the icy north and burning of ship
-The rescue of Maedhros from Thangorpdhrim

"You are a hobbit and you participe in the ACBSC (Anual Cake-Baking Shire Competition), but need some ingredients. Like grain from Maggot's grove (without him noticing!), apples from {introduce forest in the Shire}, milk from a cow in the Green Hill Country (are there cows in the GHC?), cookies from Fatty Bolger(could attack him with willpower like 'convincing' him to lend you some cookies), Elvish Food from Gildor's group, beer from The Prancing Pony(in cakes? why not?)...

And other participants may hinder you. And you lose the game if they're destroyed because you're disquallificed from killing an opponent:)

How about quests to find the three surviving dwarven rings before Sauron gets his mitts on them (unsure if this fits timeline wise).

You could have journeys through forests, mines, caverns etc with all kinds of monsters, traps, hazards (all the usualy fantasy adventure stuff) culminating in managing to find the ring (if you succeed), but after you win it slips out of your hand again for some reason (to fit back into continuity story-wise) or maybe its given to a courier to take somewhere, only to be intercepted on its way.

 

Or

 

You could have Gandalfs search through the lore and history books when he is trying to identify if Bilbo's ring is THE ring. New mechanics to cover research and maybe some spell-trapped tomes and some of the books kept in abandoned areas of cities to allow a monster or two. Gandalf would be a quest-ally while your group assists him.

 

Or

 

How about assisting a high-born, yet novice adventurer (quest ally) achieve some specific goal such as passing tests to become a Ranger, or Roharrim (spelling?) or Gondorian Soldier, or spy?

 

Or

 

Id like another snow-based quest with nice new snow-based monsters.. so how about a quest up Carradrahs (spelling?) or similar location to find a lost adventurer/artifact?

Some stages outside in the snow followed by stages internally through Ice caves

 

I wonder if the Eastern areas could have less forests, more Jungles to create some new fancyness?

Maybe some of the signal fires between Gondor and Rohan need repair?

I'm just hoping the final Saga expansion includes the Scouring of the Shire!  It always seems to get left out of adaptations, despite being the best part of the entire series!

I think it's unlikely we'll see The Scouring of the Shire in the last box, just like we didn't see Fog on the Barrow-downs and Old Forest in Black Riders. I think, however, that we'll most likely see it as a Fellowship or Gen Con quest that you can insert into campaign mode, much like the aforementioned quests.

Aw, come on!  It could fit, easily!

 

1.  Saving Frodo

2.  Sneaking through Mordor/Destroying the Ring (SPOILER ALERT:  The Ring gets destroyed, just in case you haven't read the books or seen the movies)

3.  Scouring of the Shire

I would imagine they'd want to stretch out saga content as much as possible in mass market product, now that the end looms near.

I'm certain they will want to use events that are most familiar to those who have only watched the movie, which excludes the Scouring.

 

If I were a betting man, I would say the quests are Saving Frodo, Battle at the Black Gate, and Ascending Mount Doom (which uses a similar mechanic to the one introduced in Flame of the West).

Is Battle at the Black Gate not going to be included in Flame of the West?  So far they've done a pretty good job of matching the Saga expansions up to the individual books (Book 1:  Shire-Rivendell.  Book 2:  Rivendell-Breaking of Fellowship.  Etc.)  Seems odd that they would deviate from that now.

Battle at the Black Gate is definitely not in Flame of the West. The three segments of Return of the King in FotW are The Passing of the Grey Company, The Siege of Gondor, and The Battle of the Pelennor Fields, as stated in the announcement.

Huh.  I guess I figured the siege and battle would be one quest.  There's a disappointment.

The siege and battle are one quest [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2016/6/29/the-battle-of-the-pelennor-fields/]. The second quest, while called The Siege of Gondor, actually focuses around Aragorn and company seizing the Corsair fleet:

Ok, ok, we can still make this work!  Just combine saving Frodo and destroying the Ring into one quest, add in the Black Gate, and we still have room for Scouring the Shire!
