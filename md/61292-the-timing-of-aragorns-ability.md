 Am I right in thinking that with Aragorn's ability to ready after he commits to a quest must be triggered immediately after he does commits?  i.e. Before any cards are dealt from the encounter deck.

yes, its a response action, in response to him commiting.

 so it cant be like eowyns action where you can trigger it after the staging step and before quest resolving

 thanks, that's what I thought, but wanted to double check.

 just a small clarification but it might be important to someone new reading. you do not need to do it IMMEDIATELY after committing him. by this i mean you commit him, then others can commit, then once you have determined everyone that is committing you can use his response. its not like if someone commits after he does you lose the opportunity.

 

like i said small point, but might be important :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 I also always position the physical card diagonally in this case to show that Aragorn is commited to the Quest but readied.

This is incorrect.  The First Player commits all their characters at once, then may trigger responses to those characters committing.  Then the next player commits all their characters, then triggers responses, etc.

 

Page 6 of the FAQ clears this up.

What are you saying is incorrect? Who said anything differently?

 I may have misinterpreted you, dh.

What I thought you were saying (and may have been mistaken about) is this:
Player A commits characters.
Player B commits characters.
Trigger responses to characters committing.

If that's not what you meant, I apologize.

The correct sequence is this:

Player A commits characters.
All players may respond (with Responses, not Actions) to player A's characters committing
Player B commits characters.
All players may respond to player B's characters committing (but NOT player A's characters committing).

This detailed sequence is also important for a character like Theodred. If, in the above example,  Player A controls Theodred, the extra resource from Theodred's ability can only be added to a hero controlled by Player A (as only Player A will have characters committed to the quest when the time comes to trigger Theodred's response). 

If Player B controls Theodred, the additional resource can be given to ANY hero committed to the quest.

This is very important to know for Theodred.  What's funny is that the Responses section in the Core Rules tells us that Responses are immediate and I didn't realize that when it comes to Framework steps where order may be important.  Good to know for future cards.
