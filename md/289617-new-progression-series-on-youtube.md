Hello Folks,

Â 

Jason here from Rolling Intentions. I have been doing a progression series on my youtube channel for just over a month and just wanted people to know about it in case they were interested. I have been using cards which were available when the packs came out which adds an extra challenge to the game! Just a little info, the saga boxes will be skipped for another progression series that will happen later on.

The first episode is the flies and spiders is below -

I hope you all enjoy!

Jason

Thank you for providing another source of content for our beloved game! I hope it goes well moving forward.

One minor thing, though. The first quest it Passage through Mirkwood. Flies and Spiders is in the Hobbit saga. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
