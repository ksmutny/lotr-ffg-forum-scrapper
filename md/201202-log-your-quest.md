# [Log your quest!](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201202-log-your-quest/)

## 1 [Rajam on February 2, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201202-log-your-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2028362)

With the goal of finding the best decks and hardest quests in mind, the purpose of this thread is to gather information regarding how do people fare against the several quests around. If you want to log your quest, please use the next format:

 

Deck: [Link to the deck used]

Quest: [Name of the quest]

Mode: [Easy/Normal/Nightmare]

Players: [N° of players]

Result: [Fail/Success & Score]

 

Example:

 

Deck: goo.gl/1UYvnB [http://goo.gl/1UYvnB] [seastan's The Moneymaker]

Quest: Into Ithilien

Mode: Normal

Players: 1

Result: Success! [106]

 

Feel free to put any commentaries you want to add! (Details, strategy used, etc.)

 

IMPORTANT:

 * LOG YOUR FAILURES! If everyone logs only their successes it will be impossible to find out the hardest quests and the best decks, which is one of the main purposes of this thread. If you failed a quest 20 or more times without being able to finish it, don't be ashamed of it and just go ahead and report those results in here!
 * FOLLOW THE GAME RULES. This seems obvious, but if you realize you made a mistake during your gameplay, it's preferable you don't log that quest; let's try to keep this as "clean" as possible. Also, consider the erratas that have been made (Check here the Official FAQ [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/64/ee/64ee44ca-825d-4c14-b77b-b0ad7581ee31/lotr_faq_18.pdf] with all the Erratas, version 1.8)

It's fully inspired on this deck [http://goo.gl/X2dVm6] created by seastan to beat NM Shadow & Flame with cards released up to that point

 

Outlands are really powerful, and with the help of Vilya, Galadriel's draw and Elrond's ability to pay for multisphere allies they come down faster

 

Elrond+Vilya, Galadriel and a bunch of allies combine really well too. I'm usually putting into play 2, 3 and sometimes even up to 4 allies per round, all of them with the benefit of not needing to exhaust to commit to the quest the round they enter

 

I had a previous version of this deck without outlands and with Theodred instead of Hirluin. Outlands perform better, and they're cheap so once you get that Steward of Gondor out you're pretty much set for the rest of the game in terms of resources. In the previous version of this deck I usually had over 8 cards in hand all the time, so I didn't need the harp that much; now with cheaper cards I'm usually being able to put into play much more allies, which in exchange means less cards in hand, so I'll consider the harp to combine with the mirror.

 

Finally, I'm considering taking out the Defender of Rammas and Legolas. I'm thinking of replacing the Defender of Rammas for something that comes down faster, so I'm between Snowbourn Scout, Minas Tirith Lampwright or Vassal of the Windlord. Legolas is either too expensive if he appears soon, or appears too late when I'm already fully set up, and card-draw is not an issue for this deck.

I can't pull up your deck right now, but do you have Henamarth Riversong in your deck?  If you're playing solo, it seems like knowing that such a treachery card coming up would be invaluable.

## 9 [Rajam on February 3, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201202-log-your-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2030845)

I had Henamarth in play but he died earlier because he saw The Necromancer's Reach coming and there was nothing I could do to save him
 

Now I'm thinking in replacing the 2 Vassal of the Windlord for 2 Honour Guard to prevent those situations and to aid myself against direct damage overall

You can make sure Henamarth is not exhausted for the quest phase.  The first turn you play Henamarth (don't quest with him and don't use his ability before enemies have attacked).  Then, after all enemies have attacked (if any), exhaust Henamarth to use his ability showing you what card will come up for your staging step next turn!  Then when you go to the Refresh Phase, Henamarth will ready and be safe from Necromancer's Reach. 

 

Granted, this doesn't protect him from other treacheries that just deal damage to all characters/allies regardless of whether they are exhausted or not.  But it certainly increases his survivability.

Wow I don't even want to imagine how is this in Nightmare... in normal your threat raises like foam, I'm guessing in NM your threat rises like 10 per turn lol

uff 1st time ever I beat this thing in solo... I got super close on one of those fails, managing to reach 3B, with everything ready to win the next turn, but a shadow card (the **** insect that deals direct damage) swapped my whole outland team (no Anfalas :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] ) and ruined everything

To this day I still think of this as the hardest Quest in the game by a good margin (though I haven't played the last two Quests of the last Cycle so they might overtake it for me...

Don't take anything difficulty-wise for granted until you've played Battle of Carn Dum.

This is up there on the short list of top 3 most difficult solo quests in the game  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]. You need to get super lucky with the Boromir deck. Maybe try my Moneymaker deck but swap out Hobbit Gandalf and Miruvor for Sneak-Attack and Core Gandalf.
