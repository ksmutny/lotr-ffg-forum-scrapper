# [When revealed effect at beginning of Dol Guldur quest](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52060-when-revealed-effect-at-beginning-of-dol-guldur-quest/)

Hi, I have a question about the effect "When revealed" in this quest. When I draw a card to attach to a Objective card, and I draw in this example King Spider lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=King%20Spider], does it make its effect or doesn't?

In the quest card 1A, it doesn't mentioned the word "revealed" and neither a form of it. The quest card says:

Setup: Search the encounter deck for the 3 objective cards, and place them in the staging area. Also, place the Nazgul of Dol Guldur face up but out of play, alongside the quest deck. Then, shuffle the encounter deck, and attach 1 encounter to each objective card.

In the FAQ says:

(1.19) Card Effects during Setup
"When Revealed" effects are resolved if the cards are
revealed during setup. A player can trigger responses
during setup, following the normal game rules. Players
cannot take Actions during setup.

(1.22) "When Revealed" Effects
A card is only considered to be revealed if the card or
game effect causing the card to enter play specifically
uses a form of the word "reveal".

I think this example is equal than the example mentioned in the point 1.22 of the FAQ. This situation may be a example of The Golden Rule, the cards take precedence over the rules.

I think too the same situation resolves equal if the card has Doomed and/or Surge. It's not been revealed.

I find it crystal clear that "when revealed" are not resolved here. There are many that disagree. There is one argument about objectives but I find that totally out of place as it, in my opinion, refers to objectives that enter the game from the encounter deck - like in Hunt for Gollum. Hopefully we will get a confirmation, until then I play it as the rules read (to me).

 Doomed and Surge specifically state that their effects only happen if revealed during the staging step of the quest phase.  Since you're bypassing the normal "guarded" execution, you don't do the "when revealed" on the attached cards.  However, if you somehow discarded the objectives and they worked their way through the encounter deck again, you'd have to do the When Revealed effects on the attachments since the rules for "Guarded" do use the word "reveal".

The FAQ 1.01 says "Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play, including during setup."

 Whoops!  I missed that one.  Good catch.  So the use of the word "reveal" is irrelevant to those keywords, and in that case the text on the quest card is just a reminder to do it.  Since the text for the Guarded rule DOES use "reveal", I think perhaps the When Revealed effects would have to be resolved in this case.

Why the text of the quest card is a reminder and not a rule to apply specifically in this mission? I think the 1.01 of the FAQ works to solve the cases when the text of the quest card says "Reveal X cards" and you draw a Doom or Surge card, and the rules of the Core set says:

Doomed X
If an encounter card with the doomed keyword is
revealed during the staging step of the quest phase,...

Surge
When an encounter card with the surge keyword is
revealed during the staging step of the quest phase,...

The rules says "quest phase", and the FAQ appeared to clarify their effects may be activated during the setup of the game. But the issue I asked is completely different.

Then is a problem about what has more preference, the FAQ or the card (supported by the Golden Rule).

 The FAQ specifically supersedes the rulebook - doomed and surge and guarded apply during setup, and "any time the card on which they occur enters play", which seems to suggest that you don't even need to "reveal" them for them to trigger.

 

We've got two conflicting instructions, though - one from the FAQ and one from the card.  I agree that the issue needs to be clarified; I can't solve this one on my own.  Hopefully we'll see an updated FAQ this week or next (I know they're working on it).

We play it the way that all encounter cards take full effect whether they are revealed or placed during set-up or just drawn/played during normal game play. Maybe thats not how it's supposed to be but its consistent and simple. Every card that comes off the encounter deck has an effect and we'll have to face it. Actually thats the game, if you nullify some of the cards during set-up why is there a set-up in the first place? Sometimes you draw a treachery card that has no effect during set-up - you're lucky, sometimes you draw a doomed/surge card - bad luck.

I think it is there for a reason. Especially when Dol Guldur is played solo, it makes total sense to me that the "when revealed" are not applied - thus giving at least some chance to the solo player. Of course, one can house rule it but I like to go with the design here.

Actually its not a house rule, we just stick to the FAQ and the argument that Dol Guldur is else too difficult for solo play is tarnished by the fact that Dol Guldur is too difficult for solo play anyway regardless how you rule the set up.

I guess we agree to disagree, so everyone should play the game as he/she enjoys it most.

 Unless you're in a tournament situation, then everyone should play the game the same way gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

I think the 1.01 of the FAQ resolves the quests only says "Reveal X cards" and you draw a Objective, Surged or Doomed card.

I'm expecting the next FAQ too to resolve this situationserio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/serio.gif].

The newest FAQ specificaly mentions this though. And it says no form of the word "reveal" in the text means no "when revealed" effects resolve. Otherwise, I have no problem with disagreement although it is nice to agree upon certain things.
