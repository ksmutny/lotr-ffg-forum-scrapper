Hello all,

I had some questions about my new FoS AP.

Mostly about separate staging areas:

If player A has Dain and the players are separated, player B doesn't get the bonus right?

The rulesheet says somewhere: During the encounter phase players only reveal 1 card per player that shares their staging area.

Should it read: Duribg the quest phase/During the staging step of the quest phase or am I supposed to reveal cards twice per round?

If Watchful Eyes is attached to a hero of Player A and the new encounter deck gets shuffled in the rulesheet reads: remove all other encounter cards from the game. So that does include these sorts of cards?

Thanks in advance!

Dain: correct, no player cards can affect cards at other staging areas, so while you are separated Dain will have no effect on the dwarves who are separated from him.

 

If it says "encounter phase" it's an error.  It should say "quest phase."  Just resolve the quest phase for each player individually, as if there were only 1 player in the game.

 

Watchful Eyes will get discarded when you get separated.  The cards aren't "removed" from the game though; they all get discarded, then shuffled together with the new Foundations of Stone deck.  All of the locations from the original deck get "removed" (per the quest card instructions, they are not shuffled into the new deck, and get removed from the game afterward).  

 

Hope you're enjoying the scenario, it's a good one!

Thanks GrandSpleen!

It says encounter phase, so maybe I should sent Caleb an email..

I will have my go at it this evening! Happy Holidays!
