I'm curious as to which characters from the universe have yet to see a hero version that deserves one. Either characters that have never been in the game or as exclusively allies  not new versions of existing heroes. My top 5 are as follows.

 

1. Thorin III Stonehelm

 

2. Gamling

 

3. Grimbold

 

4. Ghan-buri-Ghan

 

5. Gildor Inglorian

1. Gollum (yeah I know, controversial)

 

2. Farmer Maggot

 

3. 

 

..that's all I can think of.  I guess I don't get excited about a character simply because they are named, I need some kind of character development.  Gildor and Ghan-buri-Ghan make very good sense based on their minor but important roles in the narrative, but I'm not pining for either.

Saruman

Radagast

Alatar 

Pallando

 

Yeah, I'd love to have the 5 istari as heroes, even though it's pretty much impossible that we'll ever see the Blue Wizards, at least with those names.

Thranduil
Gildor
Rumil and Orophin

Radagast 

(Yes I like my elves!) 

Also would LOVE to see an Ally version of Aragorn that is high cost but has a powerful effect.

I forgot all about Thranduil. I hope that we see him in the next deluxe expansion as that is where they typically introduce the more important characters. I would also be interested to see if they try to make him work with the Silvan trait or do something more unique.

1. Thranduil

2. Grimbold

Thranduil has got to be right around the corner. He's the only one on this list who feels truly... missing.

Well, I cannot quite understand we still haven't seen Thranduil in any form. Him being one of the few great Leaders of the Free People at the time frame, we are bound to get him soon. But when? The next cycle, surely it is not going to be centered around Silvan since we have had so many? Perhaps he could be in the first pack just like Celeborn was.

 

Then Gildor Inglorion, certainly due a hero version, having had the ally released in cycle 1. Lore please, same stats as the ally, 11 threat, a cool Noldor ability. One more Noldor hero, no more needed, I feel.

 

Grimbeorn, even more than the above, an objective-ally is not enough. Ally might be but a hero is preferable. Leadership, again, working with Beorn, hopefully.

 

Tom Bombadil & Goldberry. I have to name them once more though I would of course prefer them as allies. If I do not get player cards of those (at least an event) after collecting the game for so many years, I won't be happy about that.

It's Fredegar, not "Fatty". Try not to be so insensitive. It's not 1954 any more.

1) Grimbold Spirit

2) Meneldor or Gwaihir

3) At least a silvan Spirit Hero. (FFG created or not)

5) Farmer Maggot

4) Radagast

 

I wish at least 1 neutral Rohan ally.

 

Noldor, Silvan,Dwarf, and even Ents  have 1 neutral ally.

Dunedain and Gondor have 2 neutral allies.

Does Ranger of the North really count, though, since you need a Leadership card to get him?  Or am I missing a Dunedain somewhere?

I forgot about the eagles! I'd love to see Meneldor or Gwaihir as heroes.

Ranger of Cardolan ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I'd like to see hero versions of all the dwarves in the company that don't have a hero version yet, i.e. Fili and Kili.

Also, definitely would like to see Rumil and Orophin as heroes, possibly with one of them as the missing spirit Silvan we need.

I know they're making their way through the list, but they should make at least allies of all the people mentioned in the song after the Battle of Pelennor Fields.

And lastly, I'd LOVE to see another version of Erkenbrand that was a little more Rohan focused, or if not that at least a little more powerful than he currently is. He's one of my favorite characters and one of my least popular heroes. And maybe a Spirit/Leadership version of Eomer.

Alright, I'm done.

1. Thranduil

2. Grimbold

3. Hurin the Tall, Warden of the Keys

4. Bard II, son of Brand

5. Rosie Cotton

 

I'm also interested in seeing Gamling, Angbor the Fearless, Grimbeorn the Old, Thorin III Stonehelm, Gwaihir, and Farmer Cotton as heroes. I want to see new hero versions of Legolas and Gimli (and I'm confident we'll get them). I'd also like to see ally versions of Aragorn, Merry, Pippin, Elladan, Elrohir, and Meneldor.

I got that one, but he said, "2 neutral allies," and the only other one I could find was Ranger of the North.

I wanna see Saruman too, but his stats must be nerfed, as it happened to Gandalf (-1 to attack, defense and willpower when compared to his Ally versions). Also, we could get his staff and maybe Glamdring (a regular attachment, this time). Besides, let us not forget that Saruman crafted a ring of his own, in “The Council of Elrond” Gandalf explains his absence to Frodo and others by relating how he was deceived and trapped by Saruman in Isengard in the Third Age year 3018. As part of his story Gandalf says:

>  
> 
>  
> 
> ‘Late one evening I came to the gate, like a great arch in the wall of rock; and it was strongly guarded. But the keepers of the gate were on the watch for me and told me that Saruman awaited me. I rode under the arch, and the gate closed silently behind me, and suddenly I was afraid, though I knew no reason for it.
> 
>  
> 
> ‘But I rode to the foot of Orthanc, and came to the stair of Saruman and there he met me and led me up to his high chamber. He wore a ring on his finger.

Soon after Saruman says:

>  
> 
>  
> 
> ‘ “The Nine have come forth again,” I answered. “They have crossed the River. So Radagast said to me.”
> 
>  
> 
> `”Radagast the Brown! ” laughed Saruman, and he no longer concealed his scorn.
> 
> “Radagast the Bird-tamer! Radagast the Simple! Radagast the Fool! Yet he had just the wit to play the part that I set him. For you have come, and that was all the purpose of my message. And here you will stay, Gandalf the Grey, and rest from jourjourneys. For I am Saruman the Wise, Saruman Ring-maker, Saruman of Many Colours! “

I would love to have a mini Saga pack with Bandobras Took, more hobbit cards and a Battle of Greenfields quest. Maybe just a whole 3 quest saga box about hobbits.

This would be an excellent idea!  I know the fan-made First Age stuff is off the table because it's from the Silmarillion and not LotR (licenses are weird like that), but this is straight from the books!

 

Maybe include adventure packs for other famous events mentioned, like the Battle of Fornost with a non-unique Hobbit Archer ally (Tactics)!

For me pretty much every Rohan and Silvan hero

I would like most to see a new Sam. I always felt leadership didn't make sense. He told some tales and sang some songs, he was the motivator that kept Frodo moving when all hope was lost, and he kicked an ass or two. Except for Bill the pony, he was never anybody's leader. I would like to see him be the next neutral hero. Give him the same stats and one of these abilities. 1; if you control only hobbit heroes (characters?) he gains the tactic, lore, and spirit, resource types. 2; spend one resource from this heroes resource pool to use his spirit in place of his defence or attack until the end of the phase.

Gwahir 
Alternate Gimli  
Alternate Legolas

I'd like to see Gwahir becasue we havent had him yet, but Gimli and Legolas because they are iconic characters that havent had a hero variant since the core set.  Legolas still sees a lot of play whether it is his ally form or his hero form,  but Gimli is usually on the sidelines.  I'd love to see Legolas and Gimli "bro" cards, giving them each a buff if the other is in play (just like Elrohir and Elladan).

For what it's worth,  I'd love an Eomer ally card as well.

Ability raise your threat by an additional  3 at the end of each round. I think this reflect the fact that Gollum sneaks around but also will ultimately draw the enemy to you. It would almost gurantee starting in secrecy but after 4 turns you would have paid the normal sum of stats in threat.
Could be overpowered so some tweaks may be needed.
-The hobbit mayor don't remeber his English name
-Lobelia Sack-Baggins: another treacherous hero
-Celebrian

I'd love to see Alatar and Pallando at least as neutral allies, that way we would have all five Istari in the game in some form.

Currently working with some people from my local group to make a custom set inspired mostly by MECCG, the Wizards, and we're planning to write an article on it and create a custom quest to go with it. You might be interested in that, I'll share my project here soon.

Radagast as a Lore Hero, whit an ability that work whit creatures enemy...

1. Thranduil - Leadership or Tactics

2. Tactics elf (right now we only have Legolas and Elladan and Elladan is not worth playing in a tactics only deck). Perhaps Rumil or Glorfindel?

3. Radagast - Neutral with Creature ability or Lore

4. Allatar and Pallando, Spirit or Neutral? Would be nice with something similar to the Elladan/Ellrohir combo

5. Gollum - low threat perfect match for secrecy deck, perhaps interaction with encounter deck ability, but with a +X threat per turn penalty.

Would love to see Rumil and Orophin...maybe set up to sync well with Haldir.

interesting looking back to see all of the predictions that have come through since then, like the new Legolas and Gimli heroes, and a Spirit Silvan hero (Legolas coincidentally filling both of those)

 

i wonder which one is next

I hope to see Thranduil (perhaps in the next Harad Deluxe)

Also Allatar and Pallando, as objective-allies or enemies in the Harad deluxe, why not?

Legolas and Gimli are heroes in the Harad deluxe.
