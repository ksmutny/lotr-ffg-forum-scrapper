I just played The Long Dark this morning and noticed as I was putting the cards away that there is a discrepancy between the encounter sets listed in the rules and the encounter sets indicated by the logo. The logos used in the rules and on Journey in the Black Pit and Continuing Eastward are for The Long Dark, Twists and Turns, and Deeps of Moria. However, the rules state that we should use The Long Dark, Twists and Turns, and Hazards of the Pit. Which are the correct encounter sets for The Long Dark?
