Looks pretty **** exciting, more excited for this than Old Forest! Can't wait till both are out and you can play them with the 3 black riders quests all in a row.

Neither compare to ring maker unfortunately.... (new player cards!!!! wooooooo!!)

all PoD expansions are exciting.. but I'm a bit bummed Tom is a n on player card that we can not build into our own decks.

I may be in the minority, but I think it would be kind of silly to have Tom Bombadil helping fight goblins in Kazaad-Dum, or fighting for Osgiliath. I know this game takes some liberties when it comes to characters being in places they normally aren't, but I am perfectly ok with having Tom stay in the woods.

Totally with you. The most childish, whimsical, comedic character (who is great don't get me wrong) should just be in his own setting and quest and shouldn't appear elsewhere

Is it any more silly than eagles flying around in a mine, or Bilbo hanging out with Aragorn or any of the other millions of thematic inconsistencies?, recently there talk of putting more than 1 horse attachment on a hero, just one of many problesm. You just need to let that all go... there is a abstract nature to how they make these LCGs... the choose to put the theme into the individual card design.. not the game design mechanisms.

Actually I agree with booored. I guess I'm just not really angry about not being able to use Bombadil in other quests since the quest looks so good and works in campaign mode. However, I'm a firm believer in compatibility, and I HATE it when they make "unique" characters and objects as objectives or other quest-specific cards. I hate it. Treasures were already a big disappointment, I want a Sting attachment I can give Frodo or Bilbo in whatever quest I want, not just the Hobbit! The same goes for stuff like Anduril, which will most definately be a Boon card in the next saga. I think these cards really kill freedom of deckbuilding and compatibility since they're quest specific and cannot use them in our decks, and when we finally get an actual player card of that specific character/object, it creates even more trouble when playing it in the Saga. I wish we got all this stuff as PLAYER CARDS, not objectives, treasures, boons, whatever. 

 

I'm still really excited for this Barrow downs quest, and Bombadil at least has some justification to be a quest-specific card. The best of all, I think, is that we can play these quests in the Saga, which is great.

I don't know why, but yes, to me it IS more silly. To each their own, but for me, I think I found where the line is in terms of how much bending of theme and logic I am able to do for this game. Probably just has to do with how silly and whimsical Bombadil is compared to the serious nature of just about every other character and card.

Very ok. I like the idea it can be include to BR compaign. 2 more quest in BR is sound really ok. Bombandil as a objective also ok.

This has to be a error in the production shot. Alt+Art cards are just art.. not changes... he should be 11 or 12 or w/e he normally us for the leadership 1 resource to untap.

I very much doubt that it will be 8 threat.

I'm never really excited about new quests. I like having a lot of good choices for quests, but I don't get excited unless I see awesome new player cards.

I really enjoy seeing the fellowship campaign unfold and just like mentioned earlier it seems that the desires of another thread are coming true about linking multiple quests together. Can't wait to try this one out, and old forrest.

I'm completely the opposite, and am all about the new quests. In fact, a whiles back I advocated all-quest packs, so that we get 60 cards of questing goodness unencumbered by player cards. Not that I have anything against player cards, of course, but I just prefer the quests - they are what makes each expansion a completely new game, after all. This announcement totally threw me, because I thought it was talking about the GenCon event, which I'd forgotten wasn't called anything to do with the Barrow-Downs. So yeah, I am absolutely crazy over the moon that we're seeing not one but two POD quests this year, though I won't get to play in either of the events. 

 

I really, really love the way the designers are supporting this game. Maybe we'll see more standalone scenarios outside of GenCon in the future?

yeah i agree (unsuprisinginly haha) - quest packs are cool...its nice to get varied content in this game

 

as for Bombadil...well, (surprisingly this time :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) im with Booored... no matter how much of a lore snob i may be, if i had bombadil sitting in my card pool - by god he would get used! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

LoTR has the slowest card pool growth of any of the LCGs, and not a little slower.. it is amazingly slow.

Lets look the other LCGs.

each pack has 20 cards in a set of 3... so a single cycle == 120 cards.

Each Deluxe has has around 50-60 cards in sets of 3. Lets say 55

LoTR on the other hand gets.. 9 cards + a hero. each pack. So in a cycle we get 54 + 6 heroes.. 1/2 as much... and the LoTR Deluxe expansions get 10-13 cards... + 4 heroes... so lets say 15..

So... We have had 3 cycles and 3 deluxe + 3 Deluxe expansions... this is roughly 270 . Any other LCG would have roughly 690.

270 vs 690.

So I am calling the exact opposite. I want mass player card expansions.. nothing but player cards.. more cards, more cards, MORE CARDS.

I'm happy that they're tying some of the POD stuff into the campaigns. I'll have to look into getting these when they come out, should be fun! Plus, anything that links the scenarios and gives some continuity to different quests (more narrative FTW) is good in my book.

In theory I love that they are making all these quests linked and expanding on one campaign, but I never have the time to play more than 2 games at once, so this has no real effect on me. If I played the game a lot more, then I'd have more chance to try all the quests, so I think I'd be more excited for new quests, but I have yet to play more than 2/3 of the quests so far.

 

In all honesty, I'd be ok with not getting ANY more cards for a while because there are still so many decks and quests I want to try but will never get around to. The biggest reason I get excited about new cards is simply because they spoil them.

 

I understand that comparitively I'm a casual gamer and FFG can't cater to people like me if they want to stay in business, and Caleb and co. would be sitting around doing nothing if they didn't keep releasing new content.

 

Anyway, I guess I don't have a real good point to this post... just throwing out my thoughts. Continue with your discussions. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm also mildly excited about it, and if the other players in the region show themselves it can be a lot of fun. Hopefully the retailer here has the contact data to reach them.

 

As for the full art Aragorn: I'm not really excited about that. Looks nice, but the movies have pretty much fixed "Aragorn" for me, and he looks nothing like the movie character, but instead some generic human.

 

@booored:

 

Yeah, I also want the chapter packs to alternate between player cards and challenges. I base my purchases on the content of the player cards anyway. The game just progresses slow this way (though it's equally expensive).
