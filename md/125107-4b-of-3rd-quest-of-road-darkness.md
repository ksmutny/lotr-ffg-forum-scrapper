The card is this one:

The text says: 1 additional encounter card for each player... does it include himselve, the same player in 4b? For example, if you are playing with one more friend, does you reveal 3!!! cards? Crazy

 

Am i ok?

The Grey Company did a playthrough of the Breaking of thr Fellowship and after they went to stagr 4 thry first discarded all cards in their staging area and then they revealed 6 cards (for 3 player game). They did not know if this was rifht but they thought it being realllyyy unfair otherwise!

So on stage 4 during staging playing two handed I revealed 3 cards for the player on stage 4. Being able to discard locations and enemies from questing succesfully on the stage 3 cards helps somewhat in countering this. Also engaging enemies during staging with the stages special effect also helps offset this. It is hard but I was able to overcome it just.

Mmmmh, another question about this scenario:

Each player must resolve first his quest phase before passing the starting of quest phase of next player?

In Foundations, each player reveals his cards, and just after, each player resolve their quests.

Now, it seams, each player must do his starting of quest pahse and resolving step before the next player starts his quest phase, maybe i'm wrong?

Nope, not wrong. In player order, do the commiting step, staging step and quest resolution in one go. So first the first player does the whole quest phase and then the second and so on.

Ok thanks, i thought it, but it is rare, so i needed some confirmation.

 

I like a lot the idea: Frodo is trying to keep the ring far alone. And other friends, separately, try to help him. Each stage helping the first player. Very good idea.

Yeah, the idea is cool, but this stage 4 is menacing a lot!

Oh no, if one friend is discarding locations, and other discarding enemies, and other readying or giving you cards... It is not so hard as it seems.

And it is very temathic, all the other friends helping you but from far, like the book.
