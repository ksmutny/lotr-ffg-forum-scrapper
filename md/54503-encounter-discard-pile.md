During the game can players look and check encounter discard pile???? There is nothing in the rules prevent from this. Sometimes you need count how many Evil storm still there or something............

In lotr tcg Decipher you cannot look your opponent discard pile. In Magic can.  I play as a can look but what about you guys???

 The rules don't address this at all, but I would think that looking through either discard pile is ok. (I'm only basing this on what I know about other LCGs - in CoC and AGoT, discard piles are public info.)

Can't see anything against it either. But since The game is so easy for you (meant in a good way :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ) how about stop doing that? That way it might get harder :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
