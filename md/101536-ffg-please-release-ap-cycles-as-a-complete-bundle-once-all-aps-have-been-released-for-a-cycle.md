I would absolutely love it FFG if you released completed AP cycles as a bundle, even at zero discount, just for the ease of picking everything up at once.

 

Trying to find that one, out of stock AP has grown tiresome.

 

Thank you in advance FFG!  BFFs for life!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Yes yes yes!!!!

 

I've thought dozens of times, If FFG would release a "Deluxe" version of the "core" game that included the original core + all 6 Mirkwood packs, I'd buy it in a heartbeat. I'm guessing the MSRP for something like that would be around $100, but it would be absolutely WORTH IT to me, plus it would give new players coming into the game a new entry point that didn't require hunting the Interwebz to find expansions when they go out of print.
