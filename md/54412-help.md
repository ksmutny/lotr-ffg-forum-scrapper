Â Kay guys I am stuck in this mindset that I must use spirit in every deck in order for it to be a good solo deck. I need to break this habit but the more i look and try to build a deck the more I cannot see a way around it. Help me out gimme decklists or a site to go to or something. I have a killer Rohan Deck built and I love it but need something else.
