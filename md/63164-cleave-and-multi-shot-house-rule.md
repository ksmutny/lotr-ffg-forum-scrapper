 So I've been rolling around the idea of implementing cleave and Multi-shot into the game to make it seem more theatrical and this is what I've come up with.  First off both of these actions can only be done while the enemies are adjacent to one another.  "Adjacent" simply means engaged with the same player.  With Cleave you designate your primary target and then secondary.  The left over damage from the primary goes into the second enemy.  With Multi-Shot you divide the damage among the enemies you're choosing to shoot equally and round down.  So if you have a 5 attack and attacking two enemies, then both would be attacked for 2.  With the ranged Multi-Shot you can of course attack enemies of another player but with Cleave it's only those you're engaged with.  This really is only relevant to the weaker enemies since most of them you'll need every bit of attack to get through their defense and do decent damage.  Of course Gimli if properly geared and injured could really use the Cleave.  Thought?

hi

these are interesting ideas- personally i think they are both far to over powered, and may end up upsetting the game balance

 I have to agree wholeheartedly with Rich here; great ideas for house rules. Extremely overpowered (especially in solo play where any enemy engaged with you over 1 would be 'adjacent' and therefore eligible for a royal smack down!) ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I guess we'll see the things you described as player cards in the future gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

My thoughts, too. I think these are great ideas for player cards, especially since they'll be limited to 3-per-deck. That will decrease the power they have, but still make them really useful. I imagine most decks running Gimili would include Cleave.

Those do sound like some pretty sweet ideas for future cards.

You Cleave idea sounds pretty much like my "Inner FIre" custom made Event: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/769703/cordeirooos-custom-made-lotr-stuff [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/769703/cordeirooos-custom-made-lotr-stuff]
