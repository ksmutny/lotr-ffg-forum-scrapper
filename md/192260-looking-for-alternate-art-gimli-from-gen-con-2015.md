Hello, if anyone is willing to sell their alternate art Gimli promotional card from Gen Con 2015, I would appreciate if they would send me a message as I am willing to purchase it. Thanks!

 

(Also, if anyone has any of the playmats and is willing to sell, PM me as well :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

Same here, I don't know if this kind of topics are good or bad

 

Anyways, I'm also interested. I can even exchange for an alternate Aragorn art.

Sorry for the off-topic question, but I'm curious:

 

What is quality of alt-art heroes? I mean, are they like regular cards, or like the PoD cards?

The one I have for Gimli is the same quality as nightmare cards and PoD cards
