Hey all,

I just started a blog about LOTR LCG. I'd appreciate it if you gave it a look, first article is up, and I look to write about 2-3 posts a week. If you are interested in submitting any articles for inclusion on the site, send them my way! Thanks

Hey, I liked it a lot. I liked how you proposed the why's and how's for each possible new location and setting for the next cycle, and overall your writing is good and compelling enough to keep me interested. I'll keep an eye on your new articles, congrats!

A very interesting read, I particularly like your idea of building a ranger deck!
