 Hi All,  I'm trying to get through the Shadows of Mirkwood with with the same deck, I finished The Hunt For Gollum fairly easily, but have failed at Conflict at the Carrock about 10 times.  I know it's supposed to be a harder quest.

 Basically what's happening is either the Trolls come out and I have no hope of beating them, or I do ok against them but due to Louis' ability my threat level shoots right up to 50.  I can't get a decent army up while still keeping my threat in the 30s.

Any advice?

 I've had some success using Spirit - Galadhrim's Greeting and Gandalf to lower your threat and keep it below 34.  Then, once you have your allies in play, optionally engage the trolls one at a time and beat em up.

There is also a larger thread on this.
I put my deck in there yesterday which I used to beat it. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
