what was interesting is that this idea was first seen at BGG in a free custom quest, it had 10 or 11 quest cards were you had to work your way though a maze with left and right turns... very cool.

Haven't had the chance to play the Moria quests yet, but this looks like a very good quest system. I wholeheartedly agree that FFG should do a few more of these.Â
