The FORCED effect on the second stage of the HFG Quest says "at the beginning of the quest phase"....If 1B was accomplished during the quest phase...(after the Resolve Questing step) does the Forced effect happen at the beginning of the Quest Phase of the NEXT TURN? or do i resolve the Forced effect at the end of the Quest phase which 2b was revealed?

forced effect of 1b happens after you defeat it as it says 'after players quest succesfully- so you still draw 3 enoucnter cards before moving onto 2b= the forced effect of 2b happens next quest phase

OK. Got it! Thank you both.

I have a question on 3A now..."If there are ever no heroes with Clue Objectives attached in play, reset the quest deck to stage 2B"....the Cards and FAQ v5.1 pdf i found says "If you successfully quested on 2B then you may have a chance to claim a Clue before this card takes effect".

I don't understand that last sentence.

If I defeated Quest 2B during the resolve quest phase.....I progress to 3b immediately (right?)....if at that point i don't have any players with a clue card attached to a hero, then i go back to 2B right?

What "chance" do i have to claim the clue before the 3b's forced effect if i don't have any hero's with a clue?

The text on a clue card reads: 

Response: After the players quest successfully, the players may claim Signs of Gollum if it has no attached encounter.

So if you quest successfully on stage 2B and would advance to stage 3B, you could claim the objective right after you quested successfully and then advance to 3B and would not have to go back to stage 2B.

but isn't the signs of gollum card a "guarded" card? I drew it when i had to draw an encounter in the quest phase....then, cause it is a guarded card, i drew another card (eastern crows)...so, I cannot claim it even if i did quest succesfully cause i still have to defeat the crows card ("the objective cannot be claimed as long as any encounter card is attached")

## 8 [hendersondayton on January 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58929-hfg-2b-question/?do=findComment&comment=579489)

Stage 2B has 9 progress tokens on it (need 10)...quest phase, I drew Gollum....i then drew the crows to satisfy the guarded criteria of the gollum objective.

My quest is successful and would take me to stage 3B right now....but because of the crows attached to gollum...I cannot claim the clue until the combat phase.....however, Stage 3B says "if there are EVER NO HEROES with the clue objectives, reset to 2b"....

You see my dilemma? If I accept the final progress token, progress to stage 3B (while still at the end of the quest phase), I would have to reset to 2B because i have not claimed the clue card.

Perhaps i just ignore the fact that I earned the 10th progress token...(can i do that?)...move on to the combat, kill the crows, claim the clue, and then defeat stage 2b in the next turn with the clue card in hand.

 No you cannot ignore the progress.

If you can kill the crows with some kind of direct damage, than you could claim the objective. 

You could also try to not complete stage 2b if you still have no clue and wait for one.

Otherwise you must reset stage 2B.

unfortunately, i am past the chance to not complete the stage....i committed enough characters to get past it....then drew the two encounter cards....didn't think about the potential for drawing gollum...

oh well...lesson learned.

In that situation, with an Enemy guarding the Clue, there probably wasn't anything you could do, but there are situations where you could snag that Clue before progressing. The objective's guarded by a location, and you explore it, or it's a treachery that resolves.

This topic is old, but I had a similar question, and it's about what is in quotes above here.

Active location has a clue attached to it.  My questing for this round was successful.  The location is explored (clue becomes unguarded), and the leftover progress tokens complete stage 2B -- time to flip to stage 3. 

The question is, can I claim the now unguarded Clue before flipping to stage 3?  It seems to depend on what the meaning of "after questing successfully" means.  Does "quest successfully" mean

a) have more willpower than enemy threat in staging area, or

b)  same as (a), but I also need to put down all earned progress tokens before I am considered to have "quested successfully."

If it is (a), I cannot claim the clue, because once I have "quested successfully" the location is still guarding it. 

If it is (b), a different question emerges.  Can I place ALL progress tokens (on location and quest) and then claim the clue before flipping the quest card?  I think not (flipping to the next stage must be immediate, right?).  OR, can I place progress tokens on the location, then INTERRUPT the token-placing process to claim the clue, then continue placing progress tokens on the quest card?

It seems like the answer to all these questions would be no -- in other words, if a clue is attached to the active location, you're S.O.L. unless you can explore it via Lorien Guide or something...

"Questing successfully and the physical placement of
progress tokens are two separate game occurrences
that happen in sequence during the Quest Resolution
step. As soon as the players determine that the total
committed Willpower is greater than the total Threat in
the staging area, they are considered to have quested
successfully." (FAQ, p. 5)

Ah, thanks. That answers my question.  So if a clue is on the active location, you cannot claim it after questing sucessfully even if that location will subsequently be explored.

i thought dam was saying the opposite? ie you have time before progress tokens are placed?

edit: getting in my delorean i found this from a few months back http://new.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=574485 [http://new.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=574485]

For an unguarded Clue, yes, you would have time. But in this example, the Clue was still guarded and by the active location, so no time to grab it here.

sorry i seem to be getting confused here

grandspleen asked if the location guarding it is explored and the left overs finish 2b off, can the clue be claimed

so i thought that in grandspleens scenario the clue would become unguarded and then ready for claiming

sorry if im missing something

## 18 [GrandSpleen on March 5, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58929-hfg-2b-question/?do=findComment&comment=602509)

The active location has a clue attached to it.  And here is how I am understanding the sequence of events now.

1) Players compare their collective willpower against threat in the staging area.  Players win -- the players are now considered to have "quested successfully."  This is the ONLY time when a clue can be claimed.  The active location is still in play, so the clue is guarded and not claimable.

2) Players now place progress tokens.  The active location is explored and removed.  The clue now becomes unguarded, but it is TOO LATE to claim it.  Leftover progress tokens are placed on the quest card.

3) If the quest card is finished, flip immediately to stage 3.  If you don't have any clues at present, tough luck! Go back to 2B.  Agonizing because there is an unclaimed clue just waiting to be snatched, but the rules prevent you from taking it...
