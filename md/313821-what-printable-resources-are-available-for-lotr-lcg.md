Now that the game is "paused" it seems like a good time to print out any up to date player resources.

Does anyone know of any unofficial printable resources for this game?

I'll plug my own 1-page reference on the framework (including action windows). The layout isn't as pretty as some others, but it does have the advantage of being up-to-date.
