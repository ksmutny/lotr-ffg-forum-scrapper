 If during an attack against the Muck Adder in Conflict at the Carrock, and I draw a Sacked! card, if I put it on the defending character, is the attack undefended? Or since he's been declared as the defender already does it just continue as usual?

Sacked as Shadow card for the MA does nothing, unless your MAs are Trolls too.
