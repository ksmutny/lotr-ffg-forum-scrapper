Very clearly he never leaves play, but what is the point of his Defence and Hit Points?  Surely you can attack him, but if you kill him, he is still 'In Play'.  Does killing him stop him attacking and/or stop his engageing?  We would like to stop his attacks, but not his engageing.  What can a 'dead' enemy still 'In Play', still do?  Not clear!!  Cheers!

i think it doesnt stop anything, but there are cards such as infighting that allow you to move damange from enemies to other enemies

Hadn't ever thought of that.... if no other dunlendings are in play, heap on damage to chief turch, wait for other dunlendings to arrive, use Infighting to move all the damage to one of them killing them instantly!

Oh and yeah it doesn't stop him from attacking etc, if he is still in play he's not dead.

Thanks for the quick reply.  Not what I wanted to hear, but not your fault.  If 'Infighting' is the only reason to attack Turch, it seems awfully tough.  In practice, there are plenty of other Dunlendings you need to remove.  Any other reasons to attack Turch?  So many effects have you drawing cards, and that has a lot of nasty side effects!!!  Tough scenario, which I havn't beaten yet.  Cheers!

hmm, off the top of my head, hama if you need to recycle feint/thicket or similar...you can attack him if you have no other options more useful

 

or something like vassal of the winglord if you need an ally to leave play for resource gain or something

 

sometimes i think these enemies are given stats they hardly need just for any future cards so they dont need to be errated

You certainly need to stop him attacking.  Anything that keeps him 'engaging' different players, will run the Time down more quickly.  'Mighty Prowess' will keep him damaged, without actually attacking him, but I can only think of 'Infighting' to make use of that damage.  Must think of other combos to stop the slow death.  I will experiment with 'Elrond' to double all healing, but he is costly.  The harder the Quest, the greater the pleasure when (if), I finally succeed.  Cheers!

i just use hama to recycle feint/thicket of spears :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] will keep him engaged and makes he pretty much useless

Or an uber Boromir who can take the hit each round. I've enjoyed the recent trend of quests that cares little less about how high you threat goes, since enemies often arrive engaged. This gives higher threat heroes a new lease of life.

or ...you could use gloin with a few HP / defence boosts and get him damage to get resources and do the old self preservation/gloin combo

Finally beat this brute!  Thanks for all the advice which helped me hone my decks.  It ended quite suddenly at the end of a Round.  The last Time counter was removed and I sacrificed all my healing allies to survive that last onslaught.  One team was at 49 Threat and all Heroes were badly damaged, but alive.  Very close and very exciting.  On to the next!  Cheers!
