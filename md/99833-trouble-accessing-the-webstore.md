Anyone else not able to load the FFG's webstore?  Any other part of the site seems to be running fine, but when trying to shop the page wont load for me.  Anyone else having this issue?

any suggestions for alternative sites to buy then? ideally looking for somewhere with quick shipping options, i dont mind paying more for it.  No hobby stores near me so I ideally would like a fast online option

I usually go to eBay and find a seller in or neighboring my state for a relatively quick delivery time; you may check into that.  Miniature Market and Cool Stuff Inc have great prices but the shipping can be slower.  The fastest shipping I've found is through the free two day shipping that Amazon Prime offers on many of the expansions.
