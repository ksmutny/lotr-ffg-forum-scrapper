It annoys me that the Watcher in the Water encounter deck doesn't include any cards starting with a E. It's like they intentionally wanted to prevent Elven discard decks from being able to enter Moria easily.

It was their riddle!

Celebrimbor may have helped with those doors, but it looks like the Dwarves got the last laugh.
