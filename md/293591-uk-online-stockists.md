Getting hold of old cards is a real struggle. As someone has (almost) managed to get all sagas/expansions/adventure packs over the last 6-12 months, I thought this might be a useful resource for any other UK based players out there.

In no particular order:

Thanks Matt and Icabod.

Just to add that if things get really desperate, there are always the US online retailers (stock tends to be better there). I've just bought Dead Marshes and Grey Havens from CSI, and I previously bought the Khazad Dum Nightmares from there. The pack prices were pretty good, but postage was $30. Needs must unfortunately!

There are a number of uk stockings listed , albeit none have very much stock in them.

I do not know what happened to the last 2019 re-print run as nothing i was after have ever showed up in the UK despite them coming up as shipped on FFG website etc- i am not sure if they are still coming or if there was never enough stock printed to actually reach the uk - this is especially true of the saga expansions.

It is as tough a task hunting down specific older packs as actually beating them in play :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] - slowly getting there, added Old Forest and Stone of Erech this year (albeit the forest was a relatively expensive place to visit in the end !).

I would hate to be just starting out, it is slightly less daunting when you already have a lot of packs to narrow down the searches. 

Wizard's Quest and Woodland Realm look imminent now which is exciting - has been a long wait for those as well !

Grey Havens deluxe has come into stock at Board Game Extras and Chaos Cards 👍

The Road Darkens at Game Worlds & Games Lore too

Khazad Dum is available @ Board Game Extras, for those who are hunting for the early packs and a bunch of dwarves.

## 8 [JonG on May 10, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293591-uk-online-stockists/?do=findComment&comment=3699262)

Gameslore do a top 12 list of best sellers on their home page. I don't know how seriously it can be taken but:

Mt Gundabad is no. 6

The 2 new custom scenarios are at no. 11 and no. 12

To be fair, most games stores in the UK no longer stock much LotR LCG, but it still seems to sell well. 

As an aside LoTR JiME is no.1 Three Arkham Horror LCG AP are at no's 2-4.

As a new uk based player entering into the game that is very helpful thank you !

Nice! Didn't notice the designated page.

On a side note, it looks like the Dwarrowdelf APs are in stock there (finally).

The Steward's Fear too. Kind of regret shelling out £40 for it on ebay last week now :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]

An absolute miracle if the site is correct. I don't think I've seen Dwarrowdelf in the UK for about 2 years!

When I checked, their stock levels seem a bit screwy... the main page suggests it's in stock, but when you go to the individual page - out of stock. It's a little inconsistent, so maybe a direct search is a better option, if you can filter the results.

That was certainly the case with On The Doorstep.

I've been trying to get an answer out of FFG about the poor EU support from the last print runs, but all they say is to check the upcoming page. I kindly replied saying I did that, but no stock was ever sent to the EU let alone UK, and no FLGS was even able to order the dwarrowdelf reprint, seems like it only ever went to the USA - FFG just dodge this question, I did state that now th eUK enforces the import tax, then it would be great to see some actual stock support for the EU.

I am not hopeful we will ever see a restock in the EU from FFG/Asmodee going forwards, from what I can tell their distribution arm is a mess and really hard to deal with. 

Still IF anyone finds dwarrowdelf anywhere then let the community know lol.

I just got a whole load of stock notifications for Chaos Cards. 

## 16 [icabod on June 27, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293591-uk-online-stockists/?do=findComment&comment=3729704)

Chaos cards tend to send stock notifications when they haven't had stock for a long time. Certainly in my case none of the notifications were for anything they had in stock.

That said... Black Riders would sell out quickly, so who knows.

Update - just seen that a bunch of stuff has changed state to On The Boat, including Black Riders, so that may explain the notifications.

Chaos Cards stock notification is at least partially genuine - by the time I got there, I managed to snag the very last Watcher In The Water they had back in stock!

Perhaps there is still hope of some more Dwarrowdelf reprints making it across the pond.

Has anyone seen stock anywhere of the Dreamchaser Cycle in the UK stores? Ive looked but nothing seems to have made its way over the pond.

It was in stores on FFG website but no one seems to have stock.....even in the US the reprints have sold out on FFG's website on a few packs.

Its seriously frustrating for a completionist  :p

 

I see that the Darrowdelf and Against The Shadows Cycle is on the boat but not holding out for any hope on these making it to UK stores either  :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

It sometimes takes several months or even more for items to arrive in the UK after the US gets them, so don't give up hope! I'm waiting on the Dreamchaser stuff too.

This shop from Germany has three adventure packs in stock. I do not know whether they would ship to the UK though and for how much.

Just checked the site, at the bottom is a link to "shipping and costs": They do ship to the UK, but for at least 12,99€ (18,99 if the package is above 2kg), so essentially the cost of 1 AP.

 

Also another german store (located in cologne) ships to any country of the european union (Sadly shipping is 15€ outside of germany): https://www.hiveworld.de/living-card-games/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/ [https://www.hiveworld.de/living-card-games/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/]
Their online store isn't that great to be honest as they usually have more products in store than they list online, but you might find something you need/want. At the moment they mainly offer stuff from the last three cycles...

https://www.midlamminiatures.co.uk/ [https://www.midlamminiatures.co.uk/] - Bricks and mortar store with a delivery service that sells LOTR in store. Don't know about what's in stock but I send them a message on their site and they go and check if they have it in. Good shop and customer service. Also sells Arkham Horror and large amounts of other FFG stuff.

Hi chaps. Sorry in the delay in replying. Thanks all for your help.

 

I have managed to complete my collection with various Ebay purchases, Chaos Cards recent restock and Amazon.com

Got there in the end  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Just for anyone looking, Chaos Cards has stock of some of Darrowdelf Cycle again and well as some of the Harad Cycle.

Shadow and Flame and Mumakil I know are really difficult to come by and they have both of those in stock.

They also have some Dreamchaser Cycle items as well

 

Hope this helps someone here

At last a copy of The Black Riders!  Had a notification from Chaos Cards.  It’s only took a year... can’t wait to get a campaign going 😊
