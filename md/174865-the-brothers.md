Just a tought. As many of heroes experienced a release of a nice copy as a ally, like legolas, gimli, faramir, boromir to name a few I got strong hope that elrohir and elladan will have their chance. It would be great especially for solo players like me, as a skill limitation prevent me from playing elrohir especially to often, and it's a hero with a lot potential . Anyway hope somewhere in hq someone working on it .

Agreed! They are great characters.

They are friends of the Rangers of the North, and helped a lot to defend Arnor, so maybe they're coming up!

## 4 [szuler on May 2, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1602802)

That would be great, because as much as I appreciate the thematic meaning of the dependency of those two, having them in ally version could give us some cool mix opportunities with other heroes.

Something like Kili and Fili.

## 6 [OlorinCZ on May 2, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1602846)

Wow. That would actually be cool.

But sometimes a bit stressfull.

Imagine if you run Elrohir as you primary deffender and ally Elladan will not show up (with all three copies lurking in the last 10 cards of player deck after shufelling at the beginning of the game). ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

But I think it is an axcellent idea and the whole cycle focuses on Dunedain AND Noldor no? 

So there is a big possibility they can come.

We'll yeah, it's like hidden power of Glorfindell ( spirit) and Elrond hanging on those 3 cards they need to be amazing in your deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] . Cause at the moment in solo game you are very restricted and especially Elrohir is in a bit of a corner waiting to shine.

## 8 [Olorin93 on May 2, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1602895)

Elladan and Elrohir would  be great to see as allies, or maybe new heroes in Lore and Spirit to allow for new sphere combinations.

 

I'm also really hoping for Elrond in a new sphere, but as his lore version can already pay for allies of any sphere they might not deem that necessary.

I'm not that advanced in the game as I'm dealing with dwarrofdelf atm, but Elrond seem to be the most powerfull hero so far. But that's just a tought of the subject :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 10 [OlorinCZ on May 2, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1602919)

Hehe, "Heros of one attachement". :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] (but recently I build decks with Elrond without Vylia a he is fricking amazing as well without it)

 

And I personally hope for Arwen hero (although the ally version is one of the best cards in this game). 

And of course Cirdan is must have for this cycle. Or I hope so.

Love this thread as I love the brothers! Amongst my favorite heroes and all stars in the two decks I use.
I too would love to see new versions even if I do not end up using them. Some new hero versions that can still be used with the current ones or even ally versions would be great and present many new interchangeable options when building or playing a deck/decks that use the brothers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 12 [Gizlivadi on May 2, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1603184)

Hopefully ally versions. I want ally versions of every unique character actually.

## 13 [PsychoRocka on May 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1603574)

Considering the brothers are members of the Grey Company perhaps they will be allies in the Saga box after Land of Shadow as they too take the paths of the dead alongside Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli. We could also get them in the current cycle too though....

would be great if we got new hero versions in one and ally versions in the other :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

## 14 [GrandSpleen on May 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1603580)

Seems like a very real possibility.  Every saga box to date has brought us unique allies that were supporting characters in that segment of the books.

## 15 [OlorinCZ on May 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1603629)

Yes. Excellent Idea. 
But I think the "main event" of the next saga box will be siege of Minas Tirrith and oportunity to include some of the Gondor Captains that arrived to support Minas Tirrith.

And of course attachement "Arwens Banner" for Aragorn.

Quote for backup! I hope so!

 

Heroes in the Spirit & Lore sphere plz. Making mix & match possible with the Tactics & Leadership versions :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Indeed a very good notion. But not too probable I think.

There are way to many named characters in this part of the book to give them all a card.

That, and I think the box will focus on strengthening Gondor, so I'd expect some Gondor allies. (and not outlands!)

And finally, in the box they might skip out on the quest with the grey company, as we already have the quest, sort of, in PoD form.

So while possible, I think not probable.

Yes, it's good ovecourse that certain cards are realised to match certain notion of the story in campaign , but I thing it's Importend that main personas in lotr world deserve a hero and ally version , order not importend ( like haldir - after a great ally card , got a hero with cool thematic skill and great artwork). Another thing that is an issue sometimes it's an artwork ( no offence to artists , taste is a subjective thing). But first boromir or dain are terrible, never played them as I can't stand the look of them ( a bit shallow but hey). Anyway good debate :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

## 18 [szuler on May 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1603735)

I was realny excited in past, actualy it was before i got game, when I saw tactic Eowyn. Great looking card plus cool skills. But it turned out to by fan art...

It'll be interesting to see how they handle the Outlands trait, if at all.

## 20 [OlorinCZ on May 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1603754)

No...please...no more Outlands...

More Gondor in that box.

Who have you all paired their hero versions with? I've been playing an aggro deck with Gandalf as the third hero that's done pretty well.

I've always liked the idea of the brothers, just never got around making a deck with them. If anyone has any tips for a solo deck that would be great. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

I do hope we get either different hero versions or ally versions in the future. It's cool to see two heroes key off each other.

The brothers with Sam Gamgee are very effective, in my experience. For the stats, you have a relatively low starting threat, and you have two Leadership resources ready to play Steward of Gondor on Elrohir from the first turn. Not the most thematic, I'll grant, but this card is essential for turning him into a super-defender. Ally Faramir also works well in this deck, so that it becomes powerful at questing in the mid to late game. This is also important so that you don't have to quest with Elladan and can use him as your attacker. As long as you don't care as much about theme Errand-rider and Tactics Bofur are very helpful as well. It might be a fun experience to include Weather Hills Watchman, Signals and Gather Information in this deck. That is a variant that I have been meaning to try at some point. So many new cards... not nearly enough time to try them in old archetypes. It's a wonderful problem to have.

I made a deck with Leadership Aragorn and it worked very smootly (although samowhat depending on steward, which I try not to use that much anymore ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] ). First round Steward, Sword that was Broken and half of the deck of allies, threat reduction via Secret Vigil, Rivendell blade, Signals, Arod and Blade of gondolin for Locations, Heir of Mardil + SoG or Errand ridder for another readying,....
Nevertheless I think Brothers are ment for multplayer and they really shine there especially if you give them sentinel or ranged.
Later I paired this deck with "The wielders of the three" (Gandalf-Galadriel-Elrond) and modified them to be more thematic and they worked like charm. 

## 25 [szuler on May 5, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174865-the-brothers/?do=findComment&comment=1606317)

I was trying to make elrohir work on his own with certain set of cards, like arwen, signs but it's only for the early easy quests. Aragorn (core), and trusty Glorfindel (spirit). But it's to random, had playing but it for the cards I posses I doesn't make him a def he ment to be. That's why I need a nice elladan ally :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
