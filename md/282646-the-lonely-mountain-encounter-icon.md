I can't for the life of me deduce what the encounter set icon for the Lonely Mountain is depicting.

It's honestly not a big deal, just my borderline OCD kicking in. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It kinda looks like a phoenix, to be honest. Not sure why that would be the icon, though.

Looks like a stylized dragon to me, maybe curled up around itself?

Could be a thrush maybe? certainly fits lore wise

Looks like a dragon to me. Not the best icon they've done....

Dragon, with its wings folded up, depicted from over its shoulder. They just screwed up its snout, so it looks more like a bird (phoenix) than what we think of as a dragon.

So those black ridges are back spikes and we're looking at it from behind while it turns its head around to meet us? In that case it almost seems like its back fell off! :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

And what is that black space under the head for? Is that just shading between the legs?

It's hard to describe exactly what I see, but it's something along those lines. In any case, I think we can all agree that it's not their best icon!

For that matter, what's the Ring Goes South depecting?

This is an evil icon. ?

A Warg. We're looking at his left side.

I get my names confused. I meant Journey in the Dark.

It's the Balrog. He's facing right, hunched over so that's his head on the far right (and horn), with the wing taking up most of the center. You can even see his whip of flames curling around behind on the right side.

Oh! Man I could never see that until just now. I didn't imagine they'd stylize the Balrog as a winged iguana.....

This may help put it in perspective.
