Can you use hobbit sense after you see the shadow cards by Silver Lamp?

 

Of course: you control all hobbit heroes, one of them is spirit and he is ready, etc. The question is: when game deals shadow cards, the attack has started? Can you use HobbitSense if you see it is good after watching the shadow effects?

You can use Hobbit-sense after shadow cards have been dealt.  In fact, you have to.  It's a Combat Action, so you can't use it during other phases.  When the Combat Phase begins, you deal out the shadow cards before you have any action window.  After the shadow cards are dealt, you have an action window and can play Hobbit-sense.
