My question is this:

1) I am running a deck with no tatics hero

2) I include tatics allies in my deck

does sneak attack allow me to put a tatics ally into play?

Yes. Sneak attack works with all aliies except neutral allies.

The answer the original poster's question is yes.

But to clarify, Sneak Attack also works with neutral allies (Gandalf + Sneak Attack being a staple combo in this game).

p_toler is probably thinking of a similar card which puts allies into play: Stand and Fight, which has been ruled not to work with neutral allies.

Yes I was obviously too quick with my answer there :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]. I was definitively thinking of Stand and Fight. Maybe some wishful thinking also; the ever-sneaking Gandalf can get a little tiresome sometimes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

Basically any card that lets you put allies into play (and there are quite a lot of them in the card pool now) works the same way (i.e. you don't need to have a hero of the same sphere as the ally that is being put into play). Resource matching is only needed when the ally is being "played from hand" (which is not the same as being "put into play").

Well, then you can play Curious Brandybuck, also without a Spirit hero. Always feels weird to me.

That because you can't play it, but you can put it into play, that is the whole difference ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]
