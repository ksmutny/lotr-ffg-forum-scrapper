Hello All,

When the Lorien Guide is commited to the quest and there are no active locations, can the progress token be placed on the quest?

Thanks.

 I wouldn't think so, no.

 No, if the Lorien Guide could put progress tokens on the quest card it's ability would say to put progress on the quest like Legolas's ability does.

 I played it as literally read. I was just making sure it didn't have the reverse effect like Legolas when an active location exists, the tokens go to it rather than the quest. We still lost the quest either way. Thanks.
