Hey everyone, second post is up, and this time we are talking about Complexity! Take a look and let me know what your thoughts are!

Another interesting read.  Being still quite new to the game (Core set, and 3 x AP that I've only had for 3 days), my inclination is to go for simpler cards.  It seems almost as if the more complex cards are a little closer to gambling.  I mean - you make a conscious decision that some additional cost (removing a character from play, potentially discarding two really nice cards) is worth the risk for the benefits you may get.  The less complex cards come with less risk - it's played, you get the benefit with no other cost.  I guess as I get more familiar with the cards (reading blogs, and I've been going through some of the old Grey Company podcasts) I will take riskier approaches.

The one time I consciously tried adding complexity (and hence risk) was with a Aragorn/Celebrian's Stone combination.  It resulted in the one win I've had due to the luck of the card draw, but I guess relying on specific combinations of cards is risk in itself.

Or maybe I have the wrong idea of equating risk with complexity of the cards.

I do think you are right that more complex cards tend to have more risk built in to them! My next entry for the series that I will probably is focusing on variance which may be a little more connected to Celebrian’s stone since you would only have the single copy in your deck with one core set. (Those single core set blues man, I’m in the same boat)

I think your overall assessment is probably right on though, higher complexity will often go hand in hand with higher risk! I will have to tie that in when I get to the next article!
