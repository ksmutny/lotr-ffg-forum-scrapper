There is no answer in rules reference to this: if an encounter card orders me to put an enemy from encounter deck into play, do i trigger its "when revealed" effects?

Unless the encounter card says to "reveal" the enemy you put into play, you don't do its "When revealed" effects.  When it says to "add" an enemy to the staging area, I specifically look for enemies with Surge or obnoxious "When revealed" effects because they don't trigger.

Nice, so surge doesn't trigger as well? That's great, i've been having trouble with breaking of the fellowship, this will make parth galen less of a trouble. Thanks for the answer
