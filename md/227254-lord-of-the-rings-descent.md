So I'm not fluent in all of the legalities involved in FFG's rights to produce LOTR product. From what I remember, I think they have just card game, (Curse you GW!) and this has probably already been mentioned in the forums. In any case, what do you think the chances of getting a LOTR game in the style of Descent or IA? I'd say little to none but wouldn't that be so fun!? I understand there is little at times to differentiate between the two aside from setting and I don't think there is a huge market for the setting at the moment to produce miniatures and everything, but I still think it would be cool!

Well wizkidz released Lord of the Rings Heroclix but I suspect that the dreaded Games Workshop still has a big hold over rights to Lord of the Rings miniatures due to their wargames they have for it. Could be wrong though.

They've recently started re-releasing their LotR line so it's safe to assume they still have the rights.

A LoTR dungeon crawler? I think it's pretty safe to assume that the Tolkien estate would block that. And I'd have no problem with them blocking it.

Yeah just imagine a group of racially diverse companions wandering through an underground mine filled with treasure, goblins, and an evil demon. Tolkien would be rolling over in his grave.

Descent into Moria? I'd play that.

Touché.

 

I'm honestly not sure if you disagree with me though.

I'm most curious about the statement that "the Tolkien estate" would block a LOTR dungeoncrawler.  My understanding is that all of the licensed LOTR stuff has been through Middle Earth Enterprises, the current holder of film/merchandise rights to the Hobbit/LOTR that Tolkien sold off a very long time ago.  The Tolkien Estate has rights to all the stuff *not* in those two works (i.e. stuff that Tolkien himself never sold), and I've not heard that they've ever licensed anything to anybody.

 

I don't get the impression that Middle Earth Enterprises would reject a LOTR themed dungeoncrawler on principle.

That's all true. Not sure why I forgot about MEE - as you were everybody!

The proposal is not that bad. You could make a ME game with the classic DC mechanics, but not in dungeons. You could set them in the Hornburg(what everybody calls Helm's Deep) with the players controlling a Hero of their choice(in that situation they would be Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Théoden, Háma, Éomer or Gamling) and the Dungeon Master controlling Uruk-Hai and Dunlendings.

I for one would love to see an IA-style skirmish game in this setting... but that's probably wishful thinking.
