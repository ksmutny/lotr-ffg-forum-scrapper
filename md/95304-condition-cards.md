Following a more careful reading of a shadow effect on Forest Spider the other night, it prompted the question: Am I considered to control condition attachments played on my characters by the encounter deck the way I control attachments other players put on them?

 

In other words, can I remove Caught in a Web with the Forest Spider's shadow effect?

From the FAQ:

 

(1.06) Control of Non-objective Encounter Cards
Players do not gain control of encounter cards unless
control of the card is explicitly granted by a card
effect. When an encounter card (such as Caught in a
Web, CORE 86) becomes an attachment and attaches
to a character, that character’s controller does not gain
control of the attachment.

 

You cannot remove Caught in a Web with the Shadow effect.

I would really like to see more cards that counteract conditions or more conditions like Shadow of Fear that have a built in removal action. They're not all of a sudden like a sleeping sentry but the number of times Local Trouble or especially Watchful Eyes has caused me grief!
