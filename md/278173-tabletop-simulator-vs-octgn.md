I'm new to Tabletop Simulator and recently noticed that it supports a couple of LotR LCG mods/games.  I took a quick look at one, and while I liked the graphics, I felt like it was quite a bit more "work" to play than OCGTN.

What I'm wondering is:

1) Once someone gets familiar with Tabletop Simulator, is it possible for LotR LCG to get just as fast/easy on it as on OCTGN?  Or will OCTGN always have an edge in terms of gameplay efficiency?

2) Does Tabletop Simulator allow you to save the state of an LotR LCG game in progress?  Or is it like OCGTN in that once it's turned off, all game state is lost?

3) What is the "best" (in terms of user-friendliness and efficiency) LotR LCG mod/game for Tabletop Simulator?  Maybe I tried the wrong one...

I have never used Tabletop Simulator, so my opinion will be biased.  I probably never will; because quite I’m satisfied with octgn. That said, most people use octgn, so if you play multiplayer, that would be the better choice.

OCTGN does allow you to save the game state. Try right-clicking the table.

My personal preference is for OCTGN over TTS. It's just way faster for me to play. I can go from having a deck built in ringsdb to playing said deck in seconds. And once you learn all the OCTGN hotkeys for stuff there's no comparison.
