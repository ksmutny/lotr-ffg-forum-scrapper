Some of these cards seem very interesting. I cannot make out much from the Leadership and Tactics card, the latter seem to draw 3 cards which is great for the sphere, the former looks quite complicated, cannot wait to have all these.

 That's been up for a couple of weeks.

 

I want that tactics event now though.  I mean like right now… before I head into The Long Dark.

The tactics card looks like it might say that you can exhaust a weapon card to draw 3 cards? Looks like theres more too it ( obviously, or that would be a very powerful card)… but i think thats part of the mechanic.

It looks like you can exhaust dori to take damage in place of a hero who is taking wounds.

I think thror's map lets you exhaust it to swap an active location with a staging area location.

Cant really figure out what the leadership card does.
