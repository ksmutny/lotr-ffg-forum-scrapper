There's no need to be sad about not attending a Fellowship event this weekend. The Hall of Beorn is giving you a chance to win your own copy - including the play mat and alternate art Legolas hero. Head on over and check it out!

Very nice of you Dan.  I'm not going to enter mostly because I don't use playmats and the alt-art card is nothing more than eBay fodder to me and I know that's not what you want.  I look forward to seeing the card concepts though!
