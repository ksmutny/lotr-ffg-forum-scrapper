# [Effective storage for booklets/rules inserts?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247304-effective-storage-for-bookletsrules-inserts/)

We've seen countless threads for storing our cards but I rarely see anything on storing the rule booklets and the folded inserts. My current setup is very inefficient, I throw all the folded pieces of paper in a large bag and call it a day. Same with the booklets. Throw them in a stack and slide them in.  Normally I would use PDF files for setup instructions, but with some PDFs marked at "403 Forbidden" and it not being up to date, I'm left to good 'ol paper. Not only that, the PDFs don't have the story bits. But with the way I store them, it's very hard to quickly find what I need haha.

Anyone have any good ideas for an effective storage? Mine is clearly not up to the task. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Side note: It would be awesome to see FFG print a book that has every booklet/rules insert in one handy little tome.

I put everything in a binder. It works out pretty nice although the deluxe rule books don't look as good as the AP rulesheets.

Ooh, now that's awesome! Much more effective that having tons of folded up pieces of paper lying about. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I noticed that all 9 quests (quest + encounter cards) fit perfectly into the expansion boxes, if you stack 2 APs ontop of each other (this uses up half the box) and use the other half for the box's quests and encounter cards. There's exactly enough room to put the rule inserts of the stacked APs ontop of the stacks. To not have everything fly through the box I use some cardboard slices (before the AP packaging changed to plastic there always were 2 cardboard pieces, which I still haven't used up :D, but any cardboard should work) to seperate the stacks. Put the box's booklet ontop and you have a very thight package with everything you need to play the cycle (and you can store everything in a shelf nice and easy).

That said I have the german versions and I think I read here that FFG changed to deluxe boxes design and they no longer come with a lid, but are opened sideways, what would destroy this way of storrage :S

I also store the quest & encounter cards from one series in its corresponding deluxe boxes; it's the best method I've found yet.

I have all the deluxe boxes up through Grey Havens (haven't gotten my hands on The Sands of Harad yet), and I can't confirm what you said about the deluxe box design changing, at least not in the US version of the boxes. (I know nothing about the German versions). So far all the deluxe boxes I have are built the same way, with a lid that you lift off of the box (like 99% of board game boxes).

I put the sheets away, and I always use this with [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com] my iPod or cell phone.

I use deluxe boxes without insert for encounter cards of wholy cycle, too, too and I was really surprised that Sands od Harad (English version) was the same as all the old ones. Game of Thrones switched the type of deluxes much earlier.

I've done color coded binders for my player cards and currently just have the rules inserts placed in card pages, but I like this solution much better and will switch to it when I get the time...Thanks for the idea!!
