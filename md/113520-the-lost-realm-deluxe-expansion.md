Undead. I love undead. Can't wait for this set to come out.

Any ideas about who the second hero could be?

Leaning towards a Spirit hero, Ranger and Dúnedain traited.

 

Maybe Halbarad?

The Shades of Angmar art is freaky!

 

Back text talks about "protect the villages of Bree-Land, hunt Orcs in the ____er Hills, and confront an ancient evil at Deadmen ___"

I agree that Halbarad would be the most obvious choice since he's really the only other named Dunedain ranger we know. For the sake of variety I'll throw out a possibility if hero Arwen out there as well but who knows, we were all thrown for a loop when we got Grima in VoI, it can always be someone out of the blue

Maybe a made-up Ranger Hobbit  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Weather Hills and Deadmen's Dike.

 

As an aside, I hope they don't venture into the Shire. I think it would be good to have a whole cycle around the Rangers protecting it.

Both of these locations are connected with Dunedain and Rangers, so maybe we get cards that boost up these traits?

We need a hobbit big enough to ride a horse!

How about a new version of 1 of the twins?

They went far and wide with the dunadan.

I would LOVE a new version of Elladan. As good as he is I find Elrohir is a million times better.

Or new versions of both would be really cool.

It would be extremely cool to have two new versions of Elladan and Elrohir. Even if they were different spheres but kept their abilities tied to the other town being in play it could create a lot of interesting combinations between the two

Spirit and Lore for them instead of Tactics and Leadership. Then you could mix and match the spheres whenever you need to, as long as they keep their "strengthened by each other" abilities.

This is awesome! I just hope we have a quest located in Fornost. My guess is that we could again be fighting bandits located in Chetwood and the like.

Fornost for sure, Deadmen's Dike (possibly the last quest) is the name which people refers to old Fornost.

 

Bandits at the borders of  Bree could be possible and I think this cycle will shine in terms of wights/spirits/undeads (as seen on the reverse of the image).

As jekzer wrote, deadmens dike IS Fornost (ruins of it) so we will get it along with undead spirits or whatsoever (nothing alive lived there anyway).

The hobbit big enough to ride a horse would be a good idea, with a club attachment to shake orc heads off.

He be dead.

Of course we could get a ffg created hobbit heroine though.

Daisy Proudfoot(feet!), big enough to ride a donkey!

Thinking back on it I think I will be extremely surprised if the second hero is not Halbarad since every deluxe expansion to date has featured two heroes sharing the same trait that the box is themed around which in this case is Dunedain making Halbarad the default option.

That being said, past behavior is not necessarily a guarantee of the future (looking at you 1 hero saga expansion and heroes/allies that changed sphere when going to ally/hero) and it wouldn't be the first time the designers extremely surprised me so we'll see and it's fun to speculate

I really want Halbarad! Glad to know the Rangers of the North are going to be getting some love.

Aren't there two MEQ characters left?
