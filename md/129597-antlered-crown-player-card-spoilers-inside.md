Holy ****, some really great cards there! :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]

Captain of Gondor is just OP man, wow!

Waters of Nimrodel! Freaking powerfull!

Don't be hasty is a great card that provides cool backup!

Shadows give way is Awesome! With songs it's even possible for nonmonoSpirit.

Ride them Down, fun, cool card.

Warden of Helm's Deep is great vs cost for defence!

The Day's Riding is a cool card. Funny how it obvoius doesn't work with Erkenbrand himself.

Erkenbrand is just cool. New defender instead Beregond.

Really cool cards! I think I like Erkenbrand, but I'm not sure how good he is. It seems they decided to give leadership Rohan a defensive approach, but that's strange considering the trait's strategy of allies leaving play and the chumpblocker scout. Maybe he's not supposed to be part of a Rohan deck, but in that case, what deck is he supposed to be in?

The other cards are also pretty good. All seem pretty playable at first glance.

Some good, some meh cards here imo.

Really like Erkenbrand. Save defense from turn 1? Yes please.

Both leadership & tactics cards are good.

Ride them down is great, but i don't see shadows give way getting played alot.

Finally, lore got the short stick in this pack imo. Both very occational cards.

Erkenbrand seems like he will complement Rohan in providing a solid defense in case of fighting bosses who cant be defended by allies or nasty chump blocking shadow effects. I like him a lot! If you pair him with warden of Healing you can have a built in Burning Brand!

I don't see how useful Don't Be Hasty will be, there are very few times this would be worth the space.

RIde them down seems like a good concept but I don't know if it's worth the cost ratio especially considering how powerful Rohan characters already are at attacking may be overkill.

Erkenbrand seems like a poor man's Balin.

 

Warden of Hems Deep is a good ally defender this game needed.

 

The Day's Rising is attachment made for Erkenbrand, but THANKS GODS it's not restricted to Erkenbrand.

 

Captain of Gondor, Ride them Down, Treebeard and Booming Ent were spoiled eons ago.

 

Shadows Give Way is a nice Spirit version of Thicket of Spears.

 

Don't Be Hasty! is not nice Lore version of Late Adventurer.

 

Waters of Nimrodel... good to have a new Doomed card.

## 10 [ossderossmane on December 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1375623)

As noted by others, leadership Rohan is quite different from the other Rohan spheres now. Let's look at the obvious comparisons:

 

Erkenbrand vs Beregond: Beregond has better raw defense and tailormade attachments, but Erkenbrand is great for shadow cancellation. He makes a better mid-range defender, and can cancel shadows anywhere, not just for attacks against him. That makes chump blocking a lot less risky and turns Erkenbrand into a nice centerpiece of the overall defensive strategy. Still needs some healing in the deck and defense boosts.

 

Warden vs. Defender of Ramas: Warden is more expensive but gets sentinel and leadership can afford it. Either is good in its sphere.

 

Day's rising: Cool to have something that interacts with Sentinel rather than ranged. I see this on Beregond or either Aragorn rather than Erkenbrand. Also a nice boost to pass to the other player in multiplayer: leadership has better resource accelleration but for tactics or lore this could be great.

 

Don't be hasty: Interesting little card. At first glance it is a reverse late adventurer, but there is some potential here. You could use it to avoid nasty efects targetting exhausted or questing characters, or resolve a boost obtained when commiting (e.g. Theodred) and then pull back the hero.

Man... I too am impressed by Waters of Nimrodel.  That looks too good to be true.  There are a bunch of quests where one of the main difficulties is losing to attrition due to archery damage or direct damage from other effects.  This card essentially solves those problems all by itself.

Ride them down is not restiricted to rohan in any way.

Quest cannon decks will love this card to take out a nasty enemy before it even engages.

This card will have merit in solo and multi player.

oh my gosh!  some of those cards are so good its just not fair for people like me who don't have lots of money!  ah well.  I have been wondering about an Erkenbrand hero, though.  I wonder why they are kinda leaving the silvan stuff they had in the past few packs.

I like the consistency of Erkenbrand's abiliy.  Balin has the risk factor since you have to deal a new shadow card.  And of course Erkie's defense is better.

Warden of Helm's deep should be cheaper

No, he does not. He gains his ability only while he is defending, so he cannot cancel any shadow outside of attacks made against him.

All things you listed here can be done with Late Advanturer the same way.

Erkenbrand can only cancel during his defense. Balin can cancel across the board, not being a defender.

How is outright cancelation inferior to dealing a new shadow card? Erkenbrand is not a poor man's anything. Also, 3 defense with Sentinel makes him great for multiplayer.

## 20 [danpoage on December 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1375707)

And yes, I understand that Erkenbrand can only cancel his own shadow cards, not those dealt against other defenders. He is a very different hero than Balin and will be a marquee defender - something that Rohan desperately needed.

By itself - it's not. By the circumstances both of these can be triggered - it's inferior by far.

Worst case scenario Erkenbrand takes 1 damage instead of being killed outright by an awful shadow card. Balin would have to spend a resource and the defender could still end up dead when the replacement shadow card is revealed.

 

Less flexible? Yes.  More of a risk/gamble? No. Inferior to Balin's? No.

> Care to elaborate on said circumstances?

What here to elaborate about? Balin cancels any shadow effect anywhere anytime and only needs to pay a resource, which there are abudance of in the leadershit. Erkenbrand NEEDS to defend HIMSELF and pay 1 health (which might not seem a lot, but for the defender with medicore base def in the sphere without healing could be not that neat).

Worst case scenario Erkenbrand takes 1 damage and then dies from attack because now this attack has enough damage to kill him. Balin would have to spend a resource and the defender could sitll end up living when the replacement shadow card is revealed.

I'm very intrigued by your comments Dan. It seems you like Erkenbrand, and can see a use for him in a Rohan deck. I'm not so sure about that. I mean, he's good- a 3 defense plus shadow cancelation hero in leadership is amazing, but I don't see how he fits in a Rohan deck, at least in a solo deck. The normal lineup is Eowyn, Eomer, Imrahil. With that lineup you can quest for 6 in the first round, then defend with a chump blocker and then attack for 8 with Eomer and Imrahil. With Erkenbrand, you quest for 4, defend with 3 and attack with 3, granted you didn't chump block. That's decent, but it seems that given Rohan's "ally leave play" strategy, I don't see how these new crds fit into that deck.

## 28 [Crabble on December 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1375806)

Erkenbrand seems really good. Especially the fact that you don't need to spend a resource to trigger his effect. One damage can be healed easily while loosing resources is always bad...
Really looking forward to get this pack in my hand and try him out but I don't know yet if he will replace Beregond as the tank defender but he opens up new possibilities for non mono tactic decks at least for me.

The Day's Rising seems to be interesting too. If you pump up Mablung with a Shield of Gondor and give him this attachment he can give you 2 extra resources per round simply by engaging and defending against an enemy.

Captain of Gondor will go into my Boromir FTW deck, it really looks like that one was made for him.

Waters of Nimrodel seems interesting. 3 resources and 3 thread seem to be high but the effect can be really powerful especially in 3 or 4 player games.

Also I like to see more ents. Will definitely try out an ent deck to see how they work.

All in all a good pack from the player card point of view, hope the quest will be awesome, too :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

First you'd need to give Mablung sentinel somehow.

Yes I know. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The post above is just a first impression, deck design will come later but with playing leadership you have access to Dúnedain Signal so getting sentinel on Mablung is possible. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yup, I've been figuring out insane combos with Heir of Mardil. Theodred + Heir of Mardil + Squire or Horn of Gondor is incredible.

 

Anyway, I really not sure how I would use the new Rohan cards, I see a lot of potential but kind of that "question searching for a problem" situation which in this game happens A LOT.

Just noticed a typo in The Day's Rising. In the title it says that, but in the ability is Day's Rising. I like the latter better.

Which game are you playing where 3 is "mediocre base def"? Did I miss the release of some 5+ base defense characters? There are what 4? characters in the entire game with a defense of 4 or more. I think you need to reacquaint yourself with the definition of mediocre.

 

Quantifying cards in the vacuum of what sphere they're in is utter nonsense. Leadership has no usable scrying to check on shadow cards, so you arguing that it's just as likely the new shadow will be better is exactly the same as someone arguing the new one will be bad, ie pointless. With Erkenbrand there are no variables, everything you need to make the decision to use his ability is right in front of you the whole time, there's no randomness to account for. How is that worse/inferior to rolling the dice on a maybe? We've already agreed it's less flexible, that's not in dispute, dismissing it as inferior seems hasty if not outright stupid.

To be clear, I don't see Erkenbrand fitting into the leaves play deck. I see him working in a more traditional-style deck, because he allows Rohan to have a defender. Lately, I am especially interested in pairing Rohan with Gondor and Warden of Healing makes Erkenbrand's drawback not really a problem. It is also worth noting that Captain of Gondor works on Erkenbrand, as anti-thematic as that might seem. Built-in sentinel should not be underestimated, this allows other decks to worry less about combat and focus on other facets of the game.

 

I don't have a specific deck for Erkenbrand yet, but I am confident that he will end up being a pillar in a new Gondor/Rohan cooperation archetype. The Rohan leaves play deck is a completely different style than this hero, and at this point I don't feel that archetype needs any more help. Once I was able to kill 3 enemies in the same round using only Éomer I was sold on that deck being legitimate. Now I am interested to see different decks based on Rohan characters. It should also be mentioned that actually defending with Erkenbrand has another advantage in that it avoids the recent encounter card hate against chump blocking.

Sounds cool! If you have Spirit in that deck and weenies such as Snoubourn Scout, you can make use the new Helm! Helm! I wonder if this pack is preparing us for what is to come in the Treason of Saruman.

 

I will also say Don't be Hasty is an amazing card. In a mono lore deck that has trouble questing early on, 3 of these could be crucial. As Trololo said, it's a Lore version of Late Adventurer, but in a sphere which really needed it.

I'm valuing his base def "medicore" not by comparsion with other heroes, but by comparsion with attack of the foes. We will usually face the ones who'll strike through pure 3 defense, and thats what matters when we are talking about self-wounding ability of the defender. 

 

You just argued that next shadow will be bad :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You're missing the main variable - Erkenbrand has just one base action. That 1 possible shadow negated per turn. How much Balin can negate is only limited by the his resources, which there are a lot with leadershit, and on my, I'll dare say, rich multiplayer gameplay experience with Balin, there were plenty of times where he used his ability multiple times per turn on different defenders and it actually helped most of the time, because most of the time you're not trying to just get rid of the shadow, you're trying to get rid of this particular nasty shadow.

Love most of these new cards. The Day's Rising and Captain of Gondor both work really well on Erkenbrand and Beregond. All the other sentinel defenders have 2 or less defense, and Theoden is the only other character that has sentinel AND warrior. There are plenty of decent options for Captain of Gondor, but not many that can use both of these. The Day's Rising can fail on Erkenbrand a bit more often because of his ability and because of have 1 less defense, but I still think there are plenty of chances to get it to work and it's always nice to have more resource generation.

 

I would argue with MNT that Erkenbrand's ability is worse than Balin's, but it's certainly not something that would prevent me from playing him.

 

Captain of Gondor is amazing and the only thing I'd like better is if it wasn't unique so I can use it on more than one character. (I'd make it limit one per character; It's just wishful thinking though :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] )

 

It kinda sucks that you have to pay 3 for a halfway decent defender ally, but 3 is a balanced cost for the Warden of Helm's Deep, and you should be able to afford it. An ally with 3 defense and 2 hit points can be pretty useful.

 

It sucks that Booming Ent starts with 2 fewer stats than Wandering Ent, but he has some pretty good potential for a lot more stats.

 

I'm surprised by the fact that anyone can use Ride Them Down: no mount or Rohan requirement. This makes it far more useful in a lot of decks. I'm scared to see how good this can be, particularly in Outlands or Dwarves who can muster so much willpower. Even Leadership Gondor decks. None of these is thematic, but oh well.

 

I don't see Shadows Give Way being played often due to its cost, but in multiplayer, this could be ridiculous.

 

Don't Be Hasty is pretty interesting. People keep thinking about it as a counter to treacheries that affect questing/exhausted characters. This severely limits its potential. I look at it as a way to "over-quest" as a safety measure, but be able to ready a character later if you find out you don't need that much willpower and would like to have another guy ready for combat. That seems like a much more common occurrence to me. I don't see how MNT sees this as similar to Late Adventurer when it removes characters from questing instead of adding them. I can see where it can have a similar outcome of saving a character from the devastation of a treachery, but by doing the opposite.

 

Waters of Nimrodel has a ridiculously powerful ability, but it also seems over-priced to me. The effect deserves the price but how many people can afford 3 Lore resources and 3 threat? Also, it's pretty rare that I end up having enough damage distributed to my characters to make it worthwhile. Of course, you can build the deck around high HP allies and Heroes so you can make better use of the card, but I don't think I'd ever include 3 copies.

 

And of course Treebeard is just awesome and sits as a cross being OHaUH Gandalf and Radagast.

It's simple. Don't Be Hasty is reverse Late Adventurer. With Don't Be Hasty you save unneeded action at en expense of a card, with Late Adventurer you throw in another needed action at en expense of a card.

You yourself explained how Don't be Hasty can be a lore version of Late Adventurer. Just quest with that one character you'd rather keep and if an enemy pops up and you need the action advantage, just play DBH and you will have it back. It's the opposite of Late Adventurer, but the result is the same, and I'd even say it's better for treacheries such as The Master's Malice.

 

Also Waters of Nimrodel is going straight to my Grima deck. When you have Aragorn threat is not a problem fo most of the game, and sometimes Warden of Healing can be too slow.

My thoughts exactly. How can Outlands be made even better? But... by giving them sniping potential! Between 3 Herdsmen, the Gandalf / Sneak Attack combo and now this, threats like Zealous Traitor suddenly seem much less fearsome. Though my deck that salivates at the prospect of using this event is not the Outlands one (not really needed there - besides, room is tight), but my questing powerhouse secrecy one. Till Celebrimbor's Secret, it had serious combat issues. That pack gave us Wandering Ent. The Antlered Crown graces us with Ride Them Down and Treebeard. With the omnipotent Glorfindel in the mix, it can deliver some serious punches aside from its main function: questing.

Leadership has no usable scrying to check on shadow cards, so you arguing that it's just as likely the new shadow will be better is exactly the same as someone arguing the new one will be bad, ie pointless. With Erkenbrand there are no variables, everything you need to make the decision to use his ability is right in front of you the whole time, there's no randomness to account for. How is that worse/inferior to rolling the dice on a maybe? We've already agreed it's less flexible, that's not in dispute, dismissing it as inferior seems hasty if not outright stupid.

I'm not arguing that the next shadow card will be bad, I'm arguing that in most every scenario I'd have no idea what my replacement shadow card is going to be, so it's a punt.

 

Even if Erkenbrand is killed after using his response (because of the extra damage) you're down a character at the end of the turn, but because you're not replacing the shadow card that outcome isn't a surprise, Erkenbrand may still die but that shadow card isn't instigating an extra attack or any number of other effects based on the defending character being destroyed etc.  If Balin uses his ability and the defender still dies you're down a character AND a resource. No matter how you slice it, every single time you use Balin's ability you run the risk of leaving your board state worse than if you had not used it at all.

 

I'm completely aware there you can use Balin's ability on more than 1 attack per turn, but that still doesn't change any of the above. Erkenbrand's strength is that at all points of the exchange the outcome is predictable, I've already said, twice, it's less flexible than Balin's, it's not however "inferior".  There's a few ways you can get more than 1 use out of Erkenbrand's ability (Stand Together and Hama, any readying effect, Eomund and Westfold Horse-Breaker if you want to keep a Rohan theme), all he needs is some healing to support him, which is no different than adding resource acceleration to support Balin.  It's a different approach, not a worse one.

If Erkenbrand uses his ability and still dies - you're down ENTIRE HERO. It's much, MUCH worse.

 

It's worse approach. Erkenbrand requires helluva setup - heals and readiness. All Balin needs is some resources, which, ONCE AGAIN, are plentiful on the leadershit. And lets take boardwide bad shadows, let's say someone else on the board was defending and Sleeping Sentry popped up... what can Erkenbrand do? NOTHING. What can Balin do? Replace the heck out of it, and the only bad thing that can happen is another Sleeping Sentry shadow, and the chances are so slim that players will ALWAYS replace it. No matter how you slice it, Erkernbrand is WORSE at shadow mitigation than Balin. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm saying it's worse IN COMPARISION. It's different approach on the same kind of question - dealing with shadows, no matter what you say.

What are you talking about?? If Balin uses his ability to replace a shadow card for another defending hero and the hero still dies it's the exact same bloody outcome.  How is that MUCH worse than Erkenbrand dying??? Ridiculous

 

Balin replacing a shadow and the ONLY bad thing is a second "boardwide bad shadow"??? Hyperbole!  Your luck must be so phenomenal if that's the case maybe you should quit LCG's and stick to the casinos?  

 

Erkenbrand needing some readying/healing is completely justified and necessary.  He completely negates the shadow, if he had no caveats stronger than throwing away resources it would break the game. It's an incredibly powerful ability sitting on the board from turn one, unlike waiting around for a Hasty Stroke.

 

Sorry I just don't see how NO shadow card being worse than MAYBE shadow card makes any logical sense.

 

"It's a different approach on the same kind of question - dealing with shadows, no matter what you say."  I'm pretty sure that's exactly what I said at the end of my previous post

Erkenbrand and Balin each have there own pros and cons. In some situations, one can be better than the other and vice versa. Stop arguing about which one is better and just agree to disagree on that opinion.

That scenario could not happen unless you chose for it to happen, since there is no element of risk/unpredictability involved.  Personally I like having the 3 defense right out of the gate, which is worth a more limited ability to me.  I love Balin too, he's my go-to leadership or dwarf splash.  I think it's silly to think that one is completely superior to the other.  They do different things.

Has anyone else noticed they're making some of the allies like mini versions of the hero in the pack, or rather that combo with the hero: Celeborn and Naith Guide, Idraen and Greyflood Wanderer, Erkenbrand and Warden of Helm's Deep, Galadriel and Galadriel's Handmaiden, etc I really like this, I hopethey keep this up, it makes building a strategy around a hero a lot easier.

Stokesbook, I can see it now. You're just a fanboy completely swallowod by your own delusions, refusing any reason. You can continue this arguement all by yourself, be my guest.

 

Grandspleen - of course it wouldn't happen unless you choose to... But there is certainly going to be events that will make this kind of situation, given how FFG loves releasing giant attack behemoths. 3 defense is nothing spectacular, even in modern environment. And it's not silly, it's just pure analytics - they both have a shadow mitigation ability, and Balin simply does it better. Your main arguement is that there is no luck factor with Erkenbrand, and here, my friend, you are wrong, because unless you are scrying shadows, your main gamble with Erkenbrand is to who you're going to defend him with, because only that shadow is going to be canceled.

I wouldn't, unless the shadow effect is so devastating - it's worth losing a hero to counter it. I'm just pointing out an obvious case where his ability would kill him.

Well, if you play Elrohir, someone is playing Elladan (I hope) and will include an Elven Mail (or he is a bad ally)

Some other lore player could even include the new sylvan/noldor boost. There's a reason why those sylvan attachment could also be played on Noldor.

Yea, Elrohir would definitely be a great candidate if you can reliably give him sentinel. I'm glad that it doesn't require a "Printed" sentinel. If you're getting defense values as high as PsychoRocka has been on Elrohir (like 9 or something), then Elrohir can defend every enemy in the game without even having Steward of Gondor attached.

These cards really open up my 2-handed Rohan decks.  I had previously been running Theoden/Eomer/Hama and Eowyn/Theodred/Dunhere, but Dunhere was usually pretty useless so Erkenbrand will be a nice replacement.  Now Erkenbrand can defend while Eomer and Hama attack and the other 3 quest.

 

Late game I envision Theoden becoming an absolute beast.  Quest for 3 and ready w/ Steed of the Mark.  Engage an enemy and trigger Captain of Gondor.  Block an attack to trigger Day's Rising and Heir of Mardil and ready again (may require a shield and/or Dunedain Warnings).  Then attack for 4.  And maybe attack for 4 again w/ a Rohan Warhorse.  All of that without even needing Unexpected Courage.

Does The Days Rising not work with Erkenbrand's ability? Because it seems as if you gain the resource as long as your hero does not get damaged from the enemy attack. Where Erkenbrand's ability I think does not count as being hit by the enemy. So in my reasoning it would work as long as the enemies attack does not exceed your defense.

> I wouldn't, unless the shadow effect is so devastating - it's worth losing a hero to counter it. I'm just pointing out an obvious case where his ability would kill him.

 

Eckenbrand is designed for multiplayer games.

I can defend for my teammate and no need to keep one ressource for "cancel" a bad shadow effect.

Balin can't defend for other player and on my first turn i will certainly use ressources so no cancel effect possible.

On some scenarios, you have to discard ressources from heroes ...

As i said, i will use Eckenbrand in Multiplayer games. So my teamates will heal Eckenbrand.

Lembas on Eckenbrand is very effective. Eckenbrand defend cancel shadow effect if needed maybe take some damage then heal and ready.

Eckenbrand can defend again and cancel shadow effect.

With leadership, i have a large capacity of generation of ressources.

So i can put a citadel armor (easily) on Eckenbrand which become a strong defender.

Eckenbrand can control the exact amount of damage he could take on an attack. It's a great advantage in combat especially with healers in game.

I have already create deck with defender with less in defense but with burning brand and some heal (Lembas).

Big ennemies become joke because HP are just like defense point. At each attack healer heal then i am ready to strongly defend again.

Balin is very good but not a good defender as Eckenbrand.

I love Balin but frequently the new shadow card is worst than the first ...

I think that compare Balin and Eckenbrand was a mistake. One is a defender guy and the other a support guy.

No, he is not. His ability is as good in multiplayer as it is in singleplayer.

 

Balin can replace shadow effects all across the board, regardless of defender and his own exhaustion.

 Well, calling someone a fanboy here, this is new. No, he is just right about something, whilst you are not, which is something you can never stand. And even taking right and wrong away, your act here is just disgusting when you attack with "delusions" and what not. You are the one who is almost never making any sense, to me, yet you are also the one randomly attacking others (random evil, remember). Do you also remember when you said that Orophin can never return allies from discard pile for the cost of 3?

> Late game I envision Theoden becoming an absolute beast.  Quest for 3 and ready w/ Steed of the Mark.  Engage an enemy and trigger Captain of Gondor.  Block an attack to trigger Day's Rising and Heir of Mardil and ready again (may require a shield and/or Dunedain Warnings).  Then attack for 4.  And maybe attack for 4 again w/ a Rohan Warhorse.  All of that without even needing Unexpected Courage.

Whoa! Theoden is gaining in importance and is able to ready and use his stats better! He is the only character that is Noble and Warrior and has Sentinel. Heir of Mardil + The Day's Rising + Captain of Gondor can be pretty awesome. If only he had better defense to make The Day's Rising work better, but since you are including Leadership anyway, you can throw Dunedain Warnings on him and a Shield of Gondor. With everything attached, he can have 7 defense. Make it tri-sphere and include Arwen?

 

I just re-read The Day's Rising, though, and my comment about unlimited Elrohir no longer stands because you have to exhaust The Day's Rising to use its ability. Can only grant one resource per round :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

> And Beregond could have Gondorian fire or Blood of Numenor so resources generator is quite good on him !

Same with Tactics Boromir, except you need to set up the Sentinel and get him more defense before he's awesome, but he can use Blood of Numenor AND Gondorian Fire a lot more due to his own readying.

If only Arwen gave sentinel during the planning phase somehow. That way both she and elven mail would allow you to put days rising on Elrohir. I don't think it would really even be so great as it will simply give him one resource a turn because you have to exhaust days rising. Also you can't use the resource you gain this way to ready him and defend again right away as you have to spend the resource to ready him as he is declared as a defender not after the attack resolves. Only if you already have at least one resource on him and use it to ready him during your first defense, then take no damage would you receive the resource from Day's Rising and be able to then use it to defend another attack and ready Elrohir. 

 

Overall doesn't really seem worth it at all to me cause you have to get sentinel first (with elven mail as Arwen wont help), then he only gets the resource if he takes no damage from an attack he defends (this is pretty easy though cause hes such a beast) and can only use the resource to ready and take another effect the same round he gains it if he already had at least one resource already and has already used his ability at least once. 

All of this when instead you can put Steward straight on him and it generates 2 resources a turn for him and generates them at any point allowing you to much more easily use them to ready him and defend multiple times.

Some people just can't be happy... I bought my pack came home, and then immediately left on a trip for Christmas. I didn't have time to upload every single card in the pack and I figured the player cards were more sought after. I no longer have it in front of me, but from the brief glimpses I took of the quest I can tell you:

Its difficulty level 7.

It has three stages.

A boss and location comes in during the last stage. You have to clear the location to damage the boss and you have to kill the boss to win.

The locations have time X with various effects.

There is a "raven deck" made up of raven clan enemies and it had its own discard pile as well.

There is a Chief Turch (spelling?) Objective ally.

It looked to have a good balance of enemies and locations.

That's all the time I had to look at it before I ran out the door.

Unfortunately I'm in a different state than my LOTR cards and will be until next week. You all will most likely have a chance to play it before I do. I really wish I had time to play it through at least once, but I just didn't have the time. The location that came out was the "Raven war camp" I believe. I can't remember the time effect on it, but I feel like it might have dealt damage to characters. I could be completely wrong on that though. I remember the new enemies were like other dunlandings and had effects on them that dealt with cards in your hand.

Just a caveat to this post and my other post, I can no way guarantee all my info on the quest is correct. I took a very brief look yesterday and I'm trying to wrack my brain for all the details. I could be wrong on some of this stuff, but I think I'm right on most of it.

So a war-camp huh, I was already hoping we would venture further into Dunland and its culture and stuff, but I was expecting visiting some sort of stronghold, because I fricking love strongholds, steadfasts, forts, etc. Anyway, just a flavor nitpick, but I hope the cards and art are cool.

And an end, I guess. Can't see any fitting place to introduce actual dunlendling player cards in nearby future. Treason of Saruman? Of course not. This Angmar stuff? Unlikely... It's dunedain stuff mostly.

It's not like the eagles were strongly tied to the packs they came in. I think we could comfortably get Dunlendling cards. Although I'm not sure how much of a priority it is in terms of traits. I'd want Beorning before it myself. We also don't have any woodsman characters (those two groups often work together in the lore so it might be nice to tie them together, especially early on when both lack cards for a full deck).

Oh yes, I forgot the new Pioneer. Oh that's not bad though that they gave him doomed. That's nicely fitting for people that live on the edge of Mirkwood. 

He doesn't at all work with Beorning, but I wouldn't want every card for each trait to link them. I'd prefer some stuff like Gondor/Rohan (although a little more synergistic than that, more stuff like Guthlaf).

Woodman getting some doomed cards will help to bolster Isenguard as well I guess.

The quest sounds incredible! Separate Raven Clan deck and discard, Chief Turch ally objective and locations with Time X all sound really clever and unique. I really hope Chief Turch packs a punch and doesn't have useless stats.

I put it to you all, because it's really in our hands, not trololo's.  He does not 'discuss' in the sense of a discussion forum... If you choose not to respond (i.e., do not acknowledge by posting a reply) to his unilateral 'discussion' tactics, you have won by controlling his output.  It's subtle and less satisfying than 'winning' an argument, but it's the more powerful form of behavioral control because 1) it's generally not recognized by the target and 2) you control behavior by pre-empting it in the first place.

Just finished my first play through. Long quest with lots of triggers. Not as hard as Morgul Vale and so probably the easiest final quest of a cycle. But much more difficult in multi-player I believe as there area lot of effects that trigger off the number of players present.

Chief Turch is a worthy ally and the Raven chief is probably a worthy adversary for many decks, but not the one I was using tonight.

Still, that was only one game and maybe I got lucky with my encounter draws. I know many of you want pictures of the encounter cards, but I don't have an easy way to post them and they will probably be on cardgamedb in a day or two anyway.

That's one thing I don't understand about this community. If I could receive the packs as early as some people do, I would always share the full spoilers with everybody asap, and as far as I know, most of the games with activy community have this kind of behavior. I guess it's just the sign of passive and not that big community.

What exactly you don't like here? Having a dunland chief as an objective ally? But this makes perfect sense if we follow the story of this cycle. Chieft Turtch (or whatever he's called) were friendly towards heroes because they helped him get this Antlered Crown, and it would be only fair if during the war of tribes heroes would assist him in battle.

> What is worth notable, they cut out the Silvans right away. Not a single Silvan aimed card. (of course some of these cards work with Silvan too, but not in particulad)

Well, there are no cards with a Silvan theme, but Ride tem Down is a card that should be crazy powerful in any SIlvan deck. Just ask your Galadhrim Minstrel.

 

 

I both love Erkenbrand and the Warden of Helm's Deep. They open up the ways to play with a Rohan deck. With a stable defender players are able to build a massive army of WP allies to, yes, RIDE THEM DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN DOWN. Uhm, and to make lotsa progress in the adventure I guess. I'm especially glad that we have one more ally that can survive a blow or two. And with all these worrysome new ways to get new resources (I'm just waiting for a card named "tax increase") the Warden is not even that expensive.

Warden of the deep is indeed great.

He has sentinel and 2 hp over the defender of rammas.

Down sides are -1defense & +1 cost. Which is no problem for leadership.

I see a lot of comparisons between Erkenbrand and Balin, but I see him more as a Burning Brand on a stick (or rather a mini-Beregond).

Need to splash Lore to get healing (I generally like to anyways), and you have a real solid defender. Balin performs a different role; he's not a defender per se, just a support card for defenders. Erkenbrand is a defender that you can splash some support cards on.

She can. Her response happens any time she exhausts, so you can use A Very Good Tale to exhaust her and trigger her response.

Cannot is not a keyword.

Although is your point that you could use Don't be Hasty to avoid an effect that cannot be cancelled? Because you certainly could do that.

You would avoid it (for the targeted character only). The effect would still trigger and effect everyone else of course,

Perhaps he was wondering if there has to be a keyword on the encounter card to trigger DbH's effect?

Cannot be canceled is not a thing that can be triggered so it's irrelevant if it present on a card you're trying to avoid or not.

Initially I thought Erkenbrand was way better and that he could take damage to cancel any shadow effect as long as he had defended that phase and he would still be lmited by only 4 hit points but only being able to use his ability for himself is just meh.. also Don't Be Hasty is terrible, yeah you could situationally pull one character out to save them from a bad treachery but its still going to affect someone else. Why couldn't this card been a great ent card? it has nothing to do with them :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

People don't seem to understand the way I see Don't Be Hasty should most commonly be used: overquesting protection. If you're questing with Haldir, Treebeard, Theoden or some other character that is decent at both combat and questing, and you don't reveal as much threat as you expected or that you revealed an enemy that you will need that combat character's help with, then you can pull him back. As mentioned it's the opposite of Late Adventurer, which so few seem to play with, but that I think is underrated.

If Late Adventurer was an attachment, I might have cared. They release weak, thematic cards, but enforce an envirnemnt where are no place for such cards in a deck.

I agree that as an unrepeatable event action, it's difficult to make room for it in decks because there are so many better cards that take up that space first. It doesn't mean that it is a bad card. It just means that it isn't good enough to compete with the staple cards.

Well, I was also thrilled by Late Adventurer, but now, it's being in my "useless" list.

Don't Be Hasty will be the same.

It takes one slot, you could have use another card to better effect

It is too situationnal, I don't see even one game out of ten where having it in hand would change drasticaly the outcome of the game

It does not give you any advantage at all, but only overquesting (or underquesting with Late Adventurer) with ONE character. This character might be the one with the most willpower to benefit from Late Adventurer, and if you didn't put it in the quest, you did something wrong, or it would be on a low willpower character, so that it would not change much the outcome. With Don't Be Hasty, it is the same, either you have quested with some high willpower that need to be covered from a treachery, but it will not prevent his peer, and you would lose a good lot willpower, or you just overquest with someone who was better at other things, so why did you put him in the quest in the first place ?

The only way it could be fine was with a good all stats character. But then, you could have switch either cards with more apporpriate event, like a rumour from the earth in the first case or a feint in the later.

 

The advantage this card(s) gives does not overcome the dead weight it represents.

The idea isn't bad, it just that the game doesn't comes with enough cards to play it with (like a little combo with dunedain tracker, or good round stat characters like gandalf) and treachery cards where this cards would be more valuable than a Test of Will.

So I agree that it is not good enough to compete with the staple cards, but by a lot, enough to find it underpowered rather than underated.

Having it as an attachment would be too great, it would need to cost a lot (3-4 at least, maybe unique), but some recursion like rumour would have make them to the "not enough good" list.

Yeah, I can't see ever choosing Don't Be Hasty over a card like Radagast's Cunning or Secret Paths.  Instead of sending extra characters and relying on Don't Be Hasty in case you overquest, you can instead send fewer characters and rely on Radagast's Cunning or Secret Paths in case you underquest.  And we're just talking about quests where you are worried about overquesting.  Most of the time it doesn't even matter so Don't Be Hasty is worthless while RC/SP can be worth 3-5 willpower for a turn.

Nonsense. A cost of 1 would already be debatable.

I think it is good to debate the power of different cards but there's more to playing this game then just the power of different cards. Maybe I'm sick of just playing Steward of Gondor or Unexpected Courage over and over again! Because this game is not competitive we can think outside of just which cards are going to win a game for us and think about having some fun and exploring different options! 
I really like that the designers are not just giving us more and more powerful cards but are giving us different ways of doing the variety of things we can do in a game. I say bring on the variety and don't dismiss a card just because it's not as powerful.

Dude, it's would be OK, but most quests deisgned with the most powerful cards in mind, so you won't have much fun with the thematic weakling unless you're a masochist.

I agree with you MNT. If it's an attachment, it would only allow you to use the ability with that specific character (that's how I would make it, otherwise attachment doesn't make sense), so it has another fundamental weakness over the event. I'd accept a cost of 1, but there's still a lot of competition between cards and it could still be considered a dud with the current set of cards we have available.

 

I don't know why people are always saying they're upset about how few cards that get released compared to other games. We tend to think that more cards = more options, and while that is true, if we want to prevent power creep, we'll always end up introducing "duds", not because the "dud" is bad, but because there are too many good cards and the "dud" will never butt them out. I'm glad player cards don't come out any faster than they do. I'm lucky if I get to try out 30% of a cycle's cards, and I'd love to try somewhere around 90% of them.

The biggest benefit I see in Don't Be Hasty is that it targets any character in play.  Late Adventurer is limited to characters you control.  This allows DBH to be a useful component of a support deck.  The ability to save another player's character from a nasty treachery or ready an emergency defender while allowing other players to focus their decks could be huge.  Though of course this is situational.  I'm just not so down on this card as I was when I first read it.

## 150 [leptokurt on January 11, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1401268)

DBH is not too bad. It's situational, true, but it makes decision making easier. Avoiding treacheries is only half of the story, and IMO not very important when you look at the current treachery cards. Keeping the balance between questing and fighting is far more important, and here is it where DBH is shining.

 

Imagine the following scenario: you're playing The Antlered Crown and you're at stage 2. You wanna make it through as quickly as possible, so send all your characters to the quest. However, you draw a nasty enemy from the encounter deck you is going to attack you this round. Fortunatly you can play DBH to call back one of your adventurers to block that enemy.

 

That's the reason why I think DBH is better than Late Adventurer. You can keep DBH in your hand until you desperatly need it, and meanwhile you can send one extra character to the quest. Late Adventurer can do this only once, and then it is gone.

Finally got around to playing the scenario. It's pretty cool. I played Eowyn, Eomer, Imrahil with a similar deck to what i used at start of VoI. Since this scenario used the same encounter sets as the First scenario in VoI. Lots of card draw hate.

i lost in first attempt, but it was close. Modified my deck a bit and then won the second time, but it was still down to the wire. Overall I was satisfied with the challenge, but a second attempt victory makes it probably the least challenging of any final cycle scenario we have had.

Tons of time effects in this one for quest cards and locations. Once locations are cleared out of the staging area things get much easier. The first few rounds of the scenario are the most difficult. I liked that the boss could jot be engaged until the unique location is explored or otherwise he could be taken out almost immediately. It took 12 rounds to beat and it felt like i had to work for it.

I like the deck i used on it, and wonder how other deck will fair.

In terms of the time mechanic, it's okay, but i think it adds to much extra in game tracking which pulls me further away from the theme of the game. The game already is quite heady, and triggering all the time effects became a bother after awhile. I'll be happy if this mechanic is used infrequently in the future.

Great to hear that you had fun, Tracker1!

As for your last note, I think they added too much time.. Time on every single quest and in this scenario like almost every location. If they did it on a less regular basis and made it even more punishing to let Time X trigger, imo it would have been more of a 'wow' effect and it would give you more the feeling of being on a hurry. In VoI it was done pretty okay, but further down the line it's less exciting.

## 153 [PsychoRocka on January 16, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/129597-antlered-crown-player-card-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=1408489)

So finally got my hands on The Antlered Crown and played a single game last night which I won.

I actually really like the quest and the way it has been designed but it is definitely the easiest of the final quests for each cycle with even Return to Mirkwood being harder with its threat gains of 8, instant 4 damage to heroes (gollums bite) and multiple copies of both Attercop, Attercop and Hill Troll. I actually found it easier than The Fords of Isen which uses two of the same encounter sets but features much more hand/drawing cards hate. 

 

I managed to utterly demolish the quest after some particularly nasty starting turns in which I ended up with 3 damage on Glorfindel, 2 damage on Elrond, 3 damage on Celeborn and 2 on Elladan due to Dunlending Battlefields time effect triggering whilst both decks had 5 cards in their hand. With first turn Asfaloth I was able to consistently keep locations under control and only had one location time effect trigger throughout the whole game and only because of a particular treachery appearing more than once. Stage 2 I was able to clear before the time effect triggered (only 1 counter was left) and stage 3 I cleared before time ran out as well (finished it with only one counter remaining). The Raven Chieftain only attacked once (feigned voices was used the other time) and there was no active location (had just cleared Raven Chieftains Camp) so he didn't remove any time counters. I managed to avoid enemies being revealed from the Raven deck pretty much every time I could and only had the two that are added to staging at the start of the game, the two that come out due to the effect of stage 2 and the one that comes out (playing two handed) due to the effect of stage 3 enter play at all (so the minimum amount). 

I used two test of wills at crucial moments to minimize direct damage effects and also used two hasty strokes (one saved a hero from dying).

I managed to defend against an 8 attack Dunlending Bandit and Elrohir lived through it (6 armour from shield and steward and cloak of lorien and then no shadow effect so only 2 damage). 

I also managed to kill TWO Raven Warriors the same way by attacking them with Haldir while in staging (both decks had low enough threat to just leave them in staging both times) who had 6 attack (dunedain mark and bow of the galadhrim) and then doing the final point of damage with a Galadhon Archer BOTH times who only cost 1 tactics resource each time thanks to O Lorien. Completely avoided their when engaged effects. 

I also even explored the Raven Chiefs Camp before the time effect could trigger. I also removed two very nasty condition attachments the turn they appeared with power of orthanc removing two instead of one which is normally the case and doing so before either of them could trigger a single time (one of which would have put the final point of damage on at least one hero if not more).

 

Shortly after the second turn and having all the damage on heroes stack up from the single location time trigger in the game (Dunland Battlefield) I had to take an undefended attack of 2 damage and Haldir also got left on a single hitpoint. I thought for SURE I was going to lose with all the damage on heroes and no healing in sight. Somehow even though I didn't draw a Warden of Healing until the third last turn and even though this quest has lots of direct damage effects I still managed to utterly crush it and pull off all that is mentioned above and then some. Probably one of the best games I've ever had to be completely honest, after the horrible start and the single undefended attack I had to take almost everything changed immediately and I managed to handle everything that appeared and quickly clear the staging area and kill all enemies. Two PERFECTLY timed Test of Wills stopped further direct damage leading to an instant loss. Several combat strategies (especially the way I dispatched both Raven Warriors) including Haldir taking enemies out before they could attack and well timed Feigned Voices allowed me to devastate the Dunlending Douchebags. Asfaloth alone kept locations well and truly under control. 

Epic and very fun game but now I'm just annoyed I can't even log it yet and have to add it to my list of games I need to eventually log for Old Forest and Barrow Downs  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]
