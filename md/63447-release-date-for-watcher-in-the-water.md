In this monday's news article Sneaking Past The Watcher in the Water, Part Three [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3207], you can read at the bottom the following:

"Use Aragorn to lead your fellowship to victory next week when The Watcher in the Water becomes available at retailers everywhere!"

So, you can expect  it to be realesed sometime near next friday (April 27th).

Greetings

The spanish publisher has the 27th as release date. It would be then between 25th and 27th depending your country.

I somehow missed that memo! Thanks guys! Man, I am really hoping this scenario delivers and becomes one I can turn to again and again.  An entire scenario that concentrates on fighting the watcher...it just can't get much cooler. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You're welcome. And I am also expecting it with joy. I can't wait to put my hands onto both the new player cards (including all those great previews of Aragorn, Arwen, Elrond's Counsel...) and the Watcher itself, which I'm sure will be so funny a quest to play. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

Please FFG (and Edge in my case), don't make us wait too much... lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]

I am not going to tell you anything that you not already heard.  I preordered last week and they are expecting the adventure pack on Tuesday.

The last expansion arrived on a Tuesday as well and I had it by Thursday.

I have fond memories of Madrid, I lived there many years ago, still follow Real Madrid and have family living there.

Even though LOTR lcg is, I believe, the best card game ever, and the perspective of having an international party in Spain would be awesome, I''ll skip this time, just because my wife is not into gaming and it is my yearly family vacation. 

I would not mind buying the Long Dark (in english) near the Plaza Mayor or elsewhere in Madrid.

Should be a great souvenir !!! (but could it cost more in Euro than in CND$►)
