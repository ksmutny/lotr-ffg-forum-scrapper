I would like to clarify when event cards can be played, what stage during a round can you use them. I understand their efects are instantaneous.

Cheers

The easiest way to learn the timing is to some time with the chart on page 30 and 31 of the rulebook.  You can play events during the green stages.

Just to clarify, the chart shows when you can play actions.  Events have no specific timing, since responses and actions follow different rules.
