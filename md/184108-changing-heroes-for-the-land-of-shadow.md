Is it just me, or are there no "rest places" in The Land of Shadow where we get to change our hero selections? I have been wondering how they were going to handle the split fellowship, and it seems the answer is that they're not handling it at all. It seems that the same heroes who march on Isengard pretty much have to time travel back and follow Frodo now.

 

Unless I missed something? (I hope I missed something).

For some reason I was thinking that you weren't allowed to use the same heroes, but I could be totally making that up.

That's the solution I was hoping that they would opt for, but I can't find that in any of the rules or on the "Campaign Mode" Cards. Unless I'm just overlooking it, which is possible.

Interesting question indeed, there should be a clarification

Ian and I mentioned this to Caleb at Gen Con - this was accidentally omitted from the rules insert. Because you are switching between the Aragorn and Frodo stories, the players get to switch heroes for free (before the first quest). I'm sure they will be issuing a clarification about this shortly, but I wanted to pass this information along to anyone who was wondering.

Are you required to switch heroes though? I know it makes sense thematically, but from a gameplay standpoint I'd hate to switch out my lineup after they've done so well for me.

I very much doubt you have to. Pretty sure you will either have the chance to change heroes (if you want to stay completely thematic) or simply keep your current ones (if you want to keep your booned out badasses like I do).

@psychorocka what heros are you using? And have you lost any along the way?

I imagine that the text will be similar, if not identical to, what is on the Helm's Deep campaign card, which is:

 

Setup: Each player may change hero cards without incurring the +1 threat penalty.

Two handed campaign. One deck uses Haldir, Spirit Glorfindel and Elrond and the other uses Elladan, Elrohir and Sam

Cool thanks for the link. Not to sound naïve but you only used one hobbit. I've been playing with more but also have been struggling.

I've been playing the sagas very close to story (non-nightmare).  I wasn't able to satisfactorily finish TRD until I got Gimli and Legolas from ToS.  For the ToS quests I really wanted to use the Three Hunters for the first quest, but since they can't quest it didn't work.  Bring in some Rohan and relegate Gimli and Legolas to allies and all went well.  Some day we'll get new verisions of G&L and I hope to be able to beat the first quest with just The Three Hunters.

 

Helm's Deep wasn't a problem with Boromir, Eowyn and Théoden.  (Boromir did not die at the end of TRD.)

 

I cheated a bit for the last quest though as I switched heroes to Treebeard, Merry & Pippen.  I got close a few times, but wasn't able to seal the deal.  Now with the new ents from Mt. Gram I'm hoping it will push the hobbits through.  I may also try switching Treebeard to an ally and trying it secrecy.

 

TLDR: It seems that I can play close to story, but I need to wait for the cards to appear.  I think it's been planned that way, but I have no proof.

That's really good to hear! I'm glad I don't have to try to justify that one to myself thematically.

Yeah never been a big fan of the hobbits in the actual stories (don't get me wrong I don't dislike them or anything they are just my least favourite race) or in the game plus in the game they are far too squishy and unreliable. I like playing strong all purpose heroes that can quest, attack or defend in a pinch if need be and Elves seem to fill that role pretty **** well (plus they are my favourite race in middle earth). Sam is a bit of an exception as he has phenomenal willpower and if you keep threat low/engage lots of enemies optionally (that have higher engagement than your threat) he can be a pretty good attacker or even defender as well. Chuck a shield and dagger on him as well as a fast hitch and hes pretty **** flexible! Also in campaign/saga quests both Sting and Anduril go amazingly on him (has the noble trait due to Noble Hero being chosen and attached to Sam) and can put him up to 5 willpower, 3 attack (that can still get boosted from his ability) and 3 defense (can also still get boosted). Attach some fast hitches to mega buffed Sam and watch him cleave through foes whilst also questing for 5 or more! 

Also he pairs really well with Elladan and Elrohir.

I fully agree with PsychoRocka. Hobbits are the worst race. Elves have an extremely rich backstory and were hugely powerful back in the day (Rog anyone), Men are relatable and have a tragic story that culminates in becoming the leading race of Middle-Earth, Dwarves are hardcore in battle, and hobbits are little short dudes who plant gardens and sing songs. Plus, we know almost nothing of their backstory before the Battle of Fornost. Even Tolkien Gateway says "They played little role in history..." How boring!

Right on the money! Also it has always bothered me that we have a rich backstory and origin for Men, Dwarves and Elves but hobbits? Who knows where they came from or how! Don't get me wrong I enjoy many of the mysteries of Middle Earth and how open they are left (Entwives, Tom Bombadil, Harad, the Dark Lands, Nameless things etc) but no creation tale or at least myth for Hobbits bothers me for some reason...

This is making me so sad... I love hobbits! How could you not? Their lack of a mythic background and legendary destiny is what I find so appealing. They rise to the occasion and become heroes when necessary, but don't seek glory. I love them precisely because they are "little short dudes who plant gardens and sing songs". 

 

I'll admit, I don't use some hobbit heroes very much (Frodo, SPippin, Fatty, and Bilbo). But I absolutely love Sam, Merry, SMerry, and Pippin. They are in some of my very favorite decks.

As I get older I feel more and more sympathy with the Hobbits... let's just chill out and have some good food and sing a song...

To be honest Grandspleen I find that quite offensive..... I am a massive tolkien fan and am pretty obsessed with everything Middle Earth. I usually have a look at the reddit subforum Tolkien Fans on a weekly if not daily basis always wanting to read more and more rants, essays or debates about anything Middle Earth. I recognise the epic journey Sam and Frodo go on (and Merry and Pippin), I am fully aware of their importance, the fact likely no one else could have gotten the ring anywhere near as far as Frodo did and how they rise to the occasion leaving their simple ordinary lives behind to join others in trying to save Middle Earth. They are perhaps even more relate-able to then men in the books. Also yes they are the true heroes of the book in a way, Sam especially.

I never said I didn't like them or didn't think they play a valuable role. I didn't discredit anything any Hobbit did or slander them in any way. They are simply not my favorite race. If you really think that I didn't truly read or understand lord of the rings just because I am not obsessed with Hobbits and don't really care for them outside of the featured ones (Sam, Frodo, Merry, Pippin, Bilbo, Fatty and Farmer Maggot who are all awesome) I think that's a pretty silly assumption to make.

I hate to further derail the discussion, but yeah, not a huge fan of hobbits either.  I appreciate them from a story perspective, and that its the actions of those who think that have no part to play on whom the fate of middle earth rests.   However,  when I am playing a game,  this is a difficult role for me to get in to.   I want to play a hero,  you know,  someone who is strong and noble and can destroy some orcs with a sword or something.  Or even if it's not a direct combat role, a leader, like Eowyn or Galadriel, somebody who feels important.   Wheras the entire point of hobbits is that they don't feel important.  Again, personally, when I am playing a game, this is not what I want, and I don't really care how good their rules are.

No internet forum discussion ever ended with somebody changing their mind, but I'll go ahead and explain what I meant when I posted a page back.
 

> Elves ... were hugely powerful back in the day (Rog anyone), Men are ... the leading race of Middle-Earth, Dwarves are hardcore in battle
> 
>  

> I want to play a hero,  you know,  someone who is strong and noble and can destroy some orcs with a sword or something. 

 

There, that was it.  Tolkien wrote history, and there are battles and conflict in history because... well, there are battles and conflict in real world history.  He was establishing a mythology that should fit in and precede our own modern world, right?

 

So you have Elves and Men of mighty stature, who can fell a dozen orcs on their own.  But that doesn't matter-- what matters is that they fell a dozen orcs while protecting someone else (Boromir), what they stand for.

 

Strength.  Nobility.  Cunning.  Talent.  Command.  Battle.  All of this smoke and mirrors, none of it important or worth aspiring to, unless it is strength to protect and valor to sacrifice, not strength to be badass in combat and valor to earn renown or feel important.  It's what you pay attention to that measures your worth.

 

So yeah, I really don't mean to offend, but for the sake of clarity and literary discussion: I do think it misses the point when people define "hero" as "someone who is strong and noble," or qualify an assessment of Tolkien's hobbits by saying that they "are the true heroes of the book in a way."

Do you think this issue (about changing heroes) will be clarified before the next FAQ?

Yeah see I didn't define hero as anything... or disagree with anything you have stated, yet because I said I was not in love with hobbits you implied I do not understand and have not truly read Lord of the Rings. No backtracking or explanation is going to reverse the implication you made. I'm not trying to start anything back up again and think its best we both drop it but just wanted to let you know your explanation in no way explains or pardons how you jumped to the conclusion that Ecthelion and myself do not have a proper understanding of the importance of Hobbits and the role they play in LOTR or really the books in general. You jumped the gun and made a judgement based solely upon the facts we do not love hobbits as much as you do and like some of the other races in this fantasy world better. You could have simply just posted about how important the hobbits are and how you feel about them or added to the discussion. Instead you pretty much tore us both down saying we don't understand LOTR. 

I was incredibly shocked to see this coming from you of all people on the forums considering you are such a polite, helpful and positive member of this community. I have nothing more to say on the subject and there is far too much negativity on the forums at the moment so off to drool at the land of shadow encounter spoilers!

I sure hope so since it's a pretty major oversight.  Perhaps they will include in the announcement that the game is available?
