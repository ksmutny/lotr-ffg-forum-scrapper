Man I hope we get Sam someday.

The other night I was thinking about how he could show up as a hero and I thought him up as a low threat cost spirit hero (5 or 6) with

1 Willpower

2 Attack

1 Defense

and the text "Samwise Gamgee gains +1 (willpower) for each Hobbit hero you control.

I know it's a far fetch from what FFG might do but for some reason I felt it was absolutely great…

Really I just dream of running an effective Hobbit secrecy deck, I think it would be one of the most fun ways to play this game.

Definitely. I've been waiting to play powerful hobbit decks for a while. Maybe we'll start seeing possibilities for them soon! 

And your version of Sam is actually pretty good in thematic terms.  I'd play him in a hobbit deck. cangrejo [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/cangrejo.gif]  For some reason I always dream of Sam being some super powerful hero… Don't know why.

I agree, Spirit does seem a logical fit for Samwise… But with Frodo already in that sphere, I would like to see some Hobbit love in the other spheres.  I definitely see that Merry and Pippin (at least the mature versions of them) could be easily slotted in the Tactics and Leadership spheres, but it really does seem hard to slot 'ol Samwise anywhere other than Spirit… sigh.  I thought perhaps that they could make a case for Lore based off his love of all things Elvish… but it was always more of an infatuation with the Elves themselves he had, rather than the knowledge they possessed…  However, it was to Sam that Frodo gave the Red Book of Westmarch, so perhaps they could do something Lore'ish based around that… 

My other thought is that a "later version" of himself could be in the Leadership sphere since he was voted as the Mayor of the Shire for 49 years!

OH!  Just had another thought… I don't think that many of us would contend that at his core Sam was someone of great spirit, first and foremost.  But he also seemed to be one of the most "flexible" of the hobbits, always rising to the challange of whatever was put in front of him.  For example, I don't think ANY of us would drop him into the Tactics sphere, BUT he did wield the Phial of Galadriel to drive off Shelob, then after briefly taking the One-ring on himself, went back and rescued Frodo single-handedly from the orcs that had captured him…

So how about a Spirit Sam, with a Phial of Galadriel attachment (because we all know they will have one in the game eventually) that in addition to whatever abilities it grants the bearer, also grants the Tactics sphere if played on Sam?  I guess they could do the same thing with the Red Book (to grant lore sphere), but I see them doing a complete separate version of Sam to represent that era…

Sam shouldn't get +1 willpower for every hobbit you control. He was oftne over shadowed by the other hobbits until it was just him and Frodo.

I'd like to see him get an ability specifically designed to combo with Frodo (maybe something to lower threat due to bolstering spirits. Or perhaps even, if Samwise is in play Frodo gets +2 willpower) I like the threat reduction more, I think that better reflects the role he filled. Rather than being heroic in his own right, he kept the party going longer than it otherwise would have.

Yes my other idea was some sort of threat reduction.

I think Sam would be really thematically strong as a decent quester with good defense, but with Frodo already being such an extraordinary defender there's no chance of that happening.

I also think it's not that bad that he'd also be Spirit, what with Against the Shadows pushing monosphere decks and all. Although that would give you trouble with Fast Hitch which will be THE card to have in a hobbit deck.

One of the exact reasons for my desire for spreading out the hobbits… lol.  I abhor using slots in my decks for the Songs to get into alt spheres…

How about Sam as the first neutral hero? Jack of all trades, master of none.

Wow… great minds think alike… lol. I was actually thinking earlier about what if they made the other three hobbits (Sam, Merry, Pippin) neutral, with some sort of mechanic for them to key off of Frodo….
