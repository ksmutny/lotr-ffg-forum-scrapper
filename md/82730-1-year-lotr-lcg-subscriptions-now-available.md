Team Covenant [http://teamcovenant.com/store/covenant-lcg-subscription] also has a service for this. They ship internationally I believe.

That looks nice, but I will probably stay with bookdepository, because their prices are competitive here and I pay no shipping. However I'll have to buy everything manually, but that is no problem for me.

Not really worth it when other outlets offer free deliverym £2.50 is more than the discount they give you so you're not really saving anything except for the effort of ordering the packs yourself.
