# [Solo League 22 -- core/Mirkwood with LOTR saga player cards](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308862-solo-league-22-coremirkwood-with-lotr-saga-player-cards/)

## 1 [dalestephenson on June 1, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308862-solo-league-22-coremirkwood-with-lotr-saga-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3947636)

Welcome to the LOTR Solo League. This month we'll be playing three quests from the core and Mirkwood cycle. The quests are:

1) Journey along the Anduin (core set)
2) Escape from Dol Goldur (core set)
3) A Journey to Rhosgobel (AP #3)

Here are the rules:

1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.

2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests. This means that you must have at least one of the core heroes or Leadership Imrahil.

3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:

For each token you have, you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource. This can be done *anytime* during setup.

The original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:

Rule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.
Rule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.

So for example, if I start with six tokens against Journey along the Anduin and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)

Remember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing Rhosgobel it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Dol Goldur.

4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker). You are required to reveal which Heroes you used, and how many cards in your deck came from outside Mirkwood, LOTR saga and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.

Note: Contracts (from the most recent cycle) are not part of the deck and should not be counted. A Loot Deck (from the Burglar's turn contract) is also not part of the deck and should not be counted. The One Ring or the Messenger of the King ally/hero should also not be counted *unless* your deck uses those cards to reach 50 -- the Master card fetched by the One Ring should be counted. You may follow contract/One Ring setup instructions at the same as hero setup, ignoring Caleb's ruling.

5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered in this league. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:
---
1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from Mirkwood, LOTR saga or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.

2nd) The number of heroes specifically from Mirkwood and LOTR saga. More is better.

3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: LeAragorn, Theodred, Gloin, LoGlorfindel, LoDenethor, Beravor, SpEowyn, Dunhere, Elanor, TaGimli, TaLegolas, Thalin, LeImrahil. More is better.

4th) The number of cards in the deck outside core/Mirkwood and LOTR saga. Less is better, and core cards beyond a single core are considered "outside" for this tiebreaker.

5th) The number of cards outside core and Rhosgobel. Less is better, and core cards beyond a single core are considered "outside" for this tiebreaker.

6th) Performance in May's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish April's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.
---

6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for August's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in August's league. July's cycle (LOTR saga) was chosen by the winner of May's league.

7) Weekly deadlines will at 11:59pm Eastern on the 14th, 21st, and 28th. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring and cannot be extended -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.

Journey Along the Anduin: June 14th
Escape from Dol Goldur: June 21st
A Journey to Rhosgobel: June 28th

8 ) I've created a google spreadsheet for results here:
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABp4BtC1so6YZ2BpH3MMQNI-JQFF9CwavdVMzBOIlu4/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ABp4BtC1so6YZ2BpH3MMQNI-JQFF9CwavdVMzBOIlu4/edit?usp=sharing]

To join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.

If you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results, but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself.

Couple Dol Guldur questions:

Can use of Valar tokens be postponed to after deciding the prisoner hero, since that occurs during setup?

Can resources on the prisoner be used? For neutral only? Also the sphere of the hero?

Valar tokens can be used anytime during setup, so you may use them after the prisoner has been decided.  Can you give them to a captured, facedown hero?  I'm not sure -- in easy mode the captured hero would have a resource, and since the hero's resource pool is not the same as the hero, I don't think those resources would go away just because he's captured, absent instruction to do so.  On the other hand, it is the hero's pool and not yours, the hero is not under your control, so you wouldn't be able to spend them anyways (and if you could spend them, facedown heroes have no spheres).  Unless there's a ruling I'm missing about the interaction between captured heroes and easy mode, I will allow you to use tokens to add to the captured hero's resource pool, but it will be useless until that hero is rescued.

I'm really excited to try this for the first time now that it's a cycle I have this month.

I've got a provisional deck built on ringsdb, I think I'm going to go for Lore Denethor, Damrod and Beravor, but I will test the deck against at least Passage through Mirkwood before settling on a final lineup. 

I haven't played solo very much at all, and not for quite a while so I don't expect to do very well against Escape from Dol Guldur especially.

Thanks to whoever picked this cycle for this month!

I decided to go for the full blast of the past approach with a LeAragorn/Theodred/SpEowyn lineup with the usual Stand and Fight shenanigans (but no Reforged). I will test it a bit then decide if try to play it against this month quests

Just a question: is there really any need for rule 2 relating to the tokens? The lowest number of tokens is better, but is there any need for a rule that says you can’t play quests with more tokens than you’ve already won it with?

I thought Caleb ruled somewhere along the line that you DO still control the prisoner? It is certainly "in play", but "cannot be used" I think. (this may or may not affect a strategy I have in mind!). Though having said that if your other two heroes are destroyed then you are deemed to have lost notwithstanding the captured hero, so maybe I am wrong.

 

The quest card says that the prisoner "does not" collect resources, but I suppose you could add resources to it via tokens before 1B triggers. It is face down, so resource icon isn't in play (?) but I guess you can use the resources as neutral, seeing as the resource pool is indeed a separate entity.

Not really, but it makes a nice pair to Rule 1.

I'd be interesting in seeing the ruling -- I believe it's in play but not controlled by the player, and there are a handful of cards out there that care if you control a hero or not.

I think you would be able to add resources via tokens after 1B triggers, simply because the simple rules for Valar tokens permit you to give a resource to "a hero", not just a hero you control. The original variant was intended for any number of decks, so in a multiplayer situation the tokens are for the entire group, not per deck.  But if you don't control the hero I don't think you can even spend the resources as neutral.  This issue should've already happened to someone due to Easy Mode (or less likely, LeDenethor), so I would've expected a ruling on this point already , but haven't seen it yet.

Journey Along the Anduin went fairly well at one token. My zero token run resulted in a turn one second hill troll and went downhill from there...

With a horribly brutal start, my 8 token run at Escape from Dol Guldur was a slim victory. Ungoliant’s Spawn, and two cavern guardians Put the pressure on early. But I finally got the momentum to swing in my favor and built up a nice board of allies (it is difficult when you can only play one per turn) and ended the game at 39 threat, with 19 victory points.

You are locked out. Never to play that scenario with those heroes under these conditions ever again. It is an unspeakable suggestion.

The only exception is if boththe scenarios and card pools open up again for a different month of the solo league.

I will say (and I am not sure if this is legal), but I've run my deck against anduin and rhosgobel and got 0 tokens for both. I've had a blast with it, but I just don't think it has a prayer for Dol Guldor. It's the hardest solo quest in the game, and to restrict it to saga/mirkwood cards makes it rather difficult. I am really going to have to strategize to see what cards I would need to see captured, who I would need to be guarded, and what cards I would need in hand, and then just keep scooping and adding cards with tokens until I can overpower whatever flips. 

It will unfortunately be more luck than deckbuilding skill 😞

I just finished playing the three quests all in a row over a couple of evenings with my first idea of a deck [https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/216344] and I got through all three without having to get any Valar Tokens, this was a big surprise, even though I felt that the games were quite lucky on my part. Along the Anduin went easily as predicted, Escape from Dol Guldur was a hard fought victory ending at 48 threat and in great part thanks to a death revolving door of Snowborn Scout + Guthwine and a couple of Stand and Fight, Journey to Rhosgobel was a really lucky game with Athelas coming out non stop. I included playthrough of all the games below (EDIT: even though the spoilers have been somehow fused into one)

Great job Alonewolf87! 

I don't think the link your to the deck works in the above post, but I guess it's much the same as the Back to Basics Solo League June 2020 [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/16336/backtobasicssololeaguejune2020-1.0] you posted a few days ago. 

I'm very impressed with your Journey to Rhosgobel game, did you test the deck against it prior to your official attempt? I used to think it was almost impossible without Lore of Imladris, but maybe I have always had rotten luck against it.

 

My testing has not gone very well, I think I'm going to drop Damrod and might try Imrahil instead. Mono-Lore didn't seem to cut it very well.

 

Also I have a query about Iron Shackles [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Iron-Shackles-Core], after reading your playthrough of Escape from Dol Guldur. Once it is attached to a player's deck it reads "The next time a player would draw 1 or more cards from attached deck, discard Iron Shackles instead."

I have always assumed if you draw X cards from an ability while Iron Shackles is attached to the deck you don't get to draw any cards. So if I use Gandalf's enter play ability to draw 3 cards while Iron Shackles is attached to the top of my deck I instead draw 0 cards and Iron Shackles is discarded. Is that correct?

I played a similar deck against it a lifetime ago (minus the Saga cards), it simply requires some good luck (I had lot of that in this playthrough, not seeing the many "only ranged/eagle can attack/defend" enemies). Lore if Imladris is indeed the silver bullet against that quest. I made a big mistake in the deckbuilding actually since I thought Daughter of the Nimrodel could also heal Wilyador in a pinch, thankfully it didn't matter, but it was a really close shave.

Indeed it's correct. Did I make a mistake on that end?

EDIT: yes you are right, when I played Valiant Sacrifice I also draw Dwarven Tomb. I shall replay Escape from Dol Guldur then. Good catch, thanks

May as well as called this the triad of the Necromancer’s Reach, such a savage card and it killed Most of my heroes in two games. haha

 

 

Wow super close game, things were going pretty good, I had a Winged Guardian take the Hill troll’s attack so only had to raise threat by 2, then I took an undefended attack from a goblin and used Gandalf/Eowyn’s super strike to take out the Hill Troll. Things were then going pretty smoothly as I built up my Eagles through a couple elf-stones. Then while questing on the final portion of phase 2 for my tow cards I drew the neceomancer’s reach and evil storm. This cleared out all of my forces including Éowyn and Beravor and left only a crippled but fully equipped Gandalf and 2x Eagles of the Misty Mountains. I had to battle the final phase with these but thankfully Gandalf hAd unexpected courage and Shadowfax to be able to take on the horde of final enemies. Finished the game at 49 threat and by the narrowest of margins. No tokens used but a humbling game, and now onto Dol Goldor.... 

 

0 tokens used

 

 

Dol Goldor, I had Beravor chosen which was basically a best case scenario for me, but also for phase 1 I drew three enemies for the encounter cards, and one of them happened to be Ungoliant’s Spawn... so yeah that was a quick game. Two tokens later I went at it again. This time Eowyn was taken out of play but I drew mostly locations for the guards. I used the two tokens for extra card draw and got steward of Gondor and wizard pipe. Things went much smoother and I turned a Gandalf into an attachment machine  and was able to power through the quest, using Elf-Stones to drop in an Eagles of the Misty Mountain, Legolas, and Beorn respectively. I was able to kill the Nazgul the round it appeared using Beorn, Legolas and Eowyn, but using her and claiming the objectives shot my threat to 48, end of the round to 49 and final questing phase I quested hard with everyone with Faramir boosting the team, and thankfully got Necromancer’s Pass, victory again at 49 threat (I really should have put some threat reduction in this deck!). 

 

2 tokens used.

 

Onto the final quest...

 

This was the quest I felt best about having the two counters for it with Ranged (including on a hero with Shadowfax) and a flock of Eagles. It actually went fairly smoothly as I blazed through the first phase then quested slower on the second so as to try to get some Athelas in play and let my Lore of Imradris cards appear. Shortly I got a forest grove and was able to use shadow of the past to put it back on top once I cleared it. Small snag in my plan occurred when a Necromancer’s reach and Festering Wounds killed Beravor and Eowyn, man those cards are savage.  then let me gain a second Athelas and I finally found a Imradris. I healed I Wilyador and then power quested with a Wilyador at 8 damage. Nice smooth quest and much better than Dol Goldor went for me. 

 

0 tokens used.

 

 

Total Tokens for all three quests: 2

A few questions/clarifications: Should Valar tokens only be spent *anytime* after step 5 (referring to the Rules of Play) of Setup (Draw Setup hand)? I saw that it used to be after you draw setup hand/mulligan. 

Also is using a Valar Token an Action rather than a Response?

 

This is the deck I've decided to go with https://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/16404/sololeague22june2020jataefdgajtr-1.0 [https://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/16404/sololeague22june2020jataefdgajtr-1.0]

I've recorded the games as I go in word and have put the quest logs on Ringsdb.

I've played Journey Along the Anduin and won it easily on 0 tokens. I was very lucky and only revealed 2 other enemies than the initial Hill Troll, and only revealed 2 locations. I was able to defeat the Hill Troll in one round with a  Sneak Attack Gandalf. I quested through stage 2 in one round with Faramir, and didn't reveal any enemies in the 4 total reveals of stage 2 staging and stage 3's When Revealed effect.

I've played Escape from Dol Guldur 4 times now with no success. Lasting 8, 4, 1, and 11 rounds and with 0, 1, 2 and 3 Valar Tokens respectively. I've had Pippin as the prisoner twice and Beravor as the prisoner twice. I haven't made it to stage 2 yet. In my prior testing I managed to win twice with 2 treacheries in setup but so far I've had at least 2 non-treacheries in every attempt. I'm hoping for some better luck on attempt 5 :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I've haven't found that the Valar Tokens have made a big difference so far, but I might just not be using them to the best effect.

 

Edit: (Added "setup hand" for clarity in the first question)

Valar tokens can be spent at any point during setup, and are not considered Actions or Responses -- they are a Setup effect that can be inserted at any point prior to the first round.

A single Valar token by itself is not going to have a large impact, even three of them (if used for resources and spread evenly) is only equivalent to the commonly-used "sleasy" or semi-easy mode (Easy mode without removing encounter cards).  But since the number keeps rising, *eventually* you'll beat practically any quest.  20 tokens can make a huge difference in most quests....

In the specific case of Escape from Dol Goldur, they are less helpful simply because the one-ally-per-turn limit means you aren't typically constrained early by cards or resources.  Dol Goldur's difficulty, especially with one-deck play, is directly related to how important the captured hero is and what the opening three reveals happen to be.  There's no substitute for luck in this quest!

Thank you.

Perhaps I should have described the exact situation I was thinking about. 

I have the card Strider's Path in my deck and am playing Escape from Dol Guldur. 

Suppose I have Strider's Path in my opening 6 card hand and keep it, and I am using 1 Valar token. Then for the setup of stage 1A The Necromancer's Tower, I reveal and attach a card to each of the objectives.

If I reveal a location, (say Mountains of Mirkwood for example) can I 'interrupt' and use the Valar token as a resource for a Lore hero then use the Response of Strider's Path to immediately travel to the location before continuing with the rest of setup?

Similarly if I had a Test of Will in my hand and revealed a treachery in setup that I wanted to cancel, could I use a Valar token to add a resource to a Spirit hero's pool and use A Test of Will to cancel that treachery?

My next games against Dol Guldur didn't went so well and I had to get to 2 Valar Tokens before winning again. I didn't have the time to make a complete walkthrough this time around but the first couple of games were wrecked by very bad reveals for the 3 Guarded Objectives. The time I won again was once again thanks to recurring the Snowborn Scout with Guthwine and a couple of well timed Stand and Fight on Beorn.

That's a good question.  Since the rules state that they can be used "anytime" in setup, I will rule that you *can* interrupt resolution of a revealed card to use a token.  Note that if you have multiple tokens, you do not have to use each of them at the same point in setup.

After 4 failed attempts at Escape from Dol Guldur I manged to win on the 5th attempt with 4 Valar Tokens, and with a lot of luck. I had Pippin as the Prisoner and 2 Treacheries revealed in setup. I used one Valar Token to ensure I could afford Steward round 1, and used the other 3 to draw cards.

I was able to get Henamarth Riversong in round 1, and he helped me plan massively. I was able to stay on top of the locations and kept threat low. In a change from almost every other time I've played this quest I claimed Shadow Key instead of Gandalf's Map to progress to stage 2. I wanted Beravor to be able to attack and defend if necessary and I had a Daughter of the Nimrodel to keep healing her back to full. I was able to defeat the Nazgul of Dol Guldur in a single round with the help of an Elf-Stone into Gandalf. I cleared stage 3 in a single round at the end. 

I did record the whole game via text, but it's very long. I haven't really got a very good system yet, but the quest log is on ringsdb: https://www.ringsdb.com/questlog/view/11078/escapefromdolguldur5-1player-2020-06-08averyluckywinhenamarthsavestheday [https://www.ringsdb.com/questlog/view/11078/escapefromdolguldur5-1player-2020-06-08averyluckywinhenamarthsavestheday]

Journey Along the Anduin: 0 Tokens

Escape from Dol Guldur: 4 Tokens

I just had a very easy win on A Journey to Rhosgobel where I was able to get away with Beravor drawing 2 cards every round. I drew 2 copies of Lore of Imladris early on and had one Athelas revealed and one Forest Grove. I didn't have any Treachery cards revealed and got Steward in round 2, and in play on Round 3, from a Mountains of Mirkwood. I was able to use Elf-Stone to great effect, getting Gimli and Haldir into play for 1 resource each. The full questlog is on ringsdb, under the deck I linked before.

So my total Valar Tokens used is 4. 0 for Journey along the Anduin, 4 for Escape from Dol Guldur and 0 for A Journey to Rhosgobel.

Good luck to anyone still yet to play!

I did it!! I really didn't think it was possible, but truly, the Valar tokens helped jump start Dol Guldur and I FINALLY got a good bounce on the guarded cards... one treachery and 2 locations.

My three heroes are Aragorn, Eowyn, and Pippin. I failed on 0, 1, 2 tokens, threating out on the last one (coming so close too!!) 

I started with Galadriel, Celebrian Stone, and Golden shield in hand. I knew if Pippin was chosen, I could dump resources on Aragorn and play Galadriel -> some attachment and get the early jump I needed. Pippin was chosen at random and so I placed 5 resources on Aragorn to play Galadriel, Celebrian Stone and still have 1 for readying. Card number 7 was Steward! Talk about a fast start!

I had Snowmane as my next card but Self-preservation seemed like an easy lock for Aragorn. Then I knew I could grab the shadow key when it was free and have no worries. Snowmane would have to wait one more turn (and with a rich blue aragorn, I knew I would be able to play it).

With early questing now in control, I was ready to roll. I got some more luck bounces, including discarding two of my three cards in hand that WEREN'T Gandalf. Eowyn and Aragorn dispatched the Wraith the turn it came in and on the last round, I grabbed the other objectives and quested all out. 44 threat and engaged with two stout enemies, I knew it was now or never. 

I've only ever beat Dol Guldur solo twice, and I really thought this deck wouldn't have a prayer, even with infinite cash and cards. But per usual, it came down to whether or not luck was in your favor.

First time I felt capable of entering (skills- and expansion-wise). I had a real blast devising a deck for it, using some (for me) shiny new cards like Lore Aragorn and A Elbereth Gilthoniel. I love Aragorn's capability to hit "reset". It bought me time to build up card draw (Gleowine) and get OtHUtH Gandalf up just in time to engage the troll. During my practice runs I found myself struggling a bit, because the initial quest power is 6 and sensible to the wrong encounter set up. I finished at threat 45, had to drop Gandalf at 41, but then Treebeard was up and in Orc-crunching mode. I am now eagerly anticipating getting the wrong hero imprisoned and adding some tokens.

https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/219220 [https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/219220]

As a curiosity, I run a hardcore deck alongside this, built from a single core, Mirkwood and the two first saga boxes (which I have). It was built on Imrahil, Eowyn and Tactics Merry. Phew, one Unexpected Courage, two A Test of Will etc is such a challenge. I was close at 2 valar tokens, but got swamped in the end (too many surges and too many wounded heroes), but made it at 3.

This is the link for that deck:

Awesome glad to hear it! I chose this cycle so those without the whole card/quest pool could participate and Dale is a legend for organizing and running this all. Cool decks and I’m a huge fan of hobbit Gandalf as well. I find running a deck with only the allotted cards quite challenging and alternate between that and just running whatever new, fun and/or powerful deck I’ve cooked up. So many ways to play.

I agree totally. In my Imrahil deck, I really miss Envoys of Pelargir and cheap Errand-riders, but I love the way I can work around Merry's ability to ready a more powerful ally, like Beorn or Gandalf. It is surprisingly good and a lot of fun. If I put Steward on Eowyn, I can stand and fight Gandalf three times, sneak attack him twice, but I can (and intend to) pick other stand and fight options when Gandalf is not around. Now where is that wizard?

Indeed it does not. This is the first time I built around the card, so lessons learned quickly. I remember noticing it when I built the deck, slipped my mind when playing it. I really like pitching alllies for will power with Eowyn and then re-standing them. Guess I will go back and re-play that 3 token run.

I just looked at your deck. I would love some of your cards in my deck, and I have the sets, but I am opening them at  a leisurely pace. Good to know that there are so many fun cards ahead of me.

## 33 [Fredmans74 on June 16, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308862-solo-league-22-coremirkwood-with-lotr-saga-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3952302)

So, today I managed to delve into Dol Guldur, and came out with 3 valar tokens. I knew I was in for a rough time, since my deck consists of a lot of 2 cost cards. Drawing 6 and 7 threat in three cards for the two first tries did not exactly help. I never came out of quest 1B. With three tokens, I finally drew Merry as prisoner, managed to get Gleowine, and then a Warden of Healing out. I was lucky to draw mostly 1 and 2 threat locations, not caring about threat and killing off the odd enemy while saving up for Hobbit Gandalf which I played on threat 41, reset to 28, and slowly ground out one ally/turn. Song of Travel helped a lot to get Arwen, Steed of Imladris and Treebeard out. The Nazgul was dealt with swiftly, and then Gandalf could carry on with his important wizard missions on his own. I snatched the key and the torch, cleared quest 2 and blitzed out at threat 44.  Henamarth and Wingfoot on Strider made the questing phase very easy to plan for.

I figured the best way to score well this month was to focus on beating Dol Guldur (which is surprisingly difficult to spell) in as few tokens as possible, and hoping that the other two quests would follow easily (not a trivial assumption!)

So I took inspiration from Authraw's excellent Darkling Door blog, taking his Galadriel-Frodo-Merry deck as a starting point, but swapping in Eowyn for Galadriel as mandatory hero. Then I realised that, since that article was published, we now have contracts. The three objectives are Restricted, so suddenly I had a lightbulb moment - why not turn the quest against itself with a Three-Hunters deck!?

Eowyn turns out to be a great choice for this - Snowmane and Herugrim mean she can quest for at least 4, ready and attack once per turn for at least 5! Then, to further help fulfilling the contract, I decided to run The One Ring on Frodo. This also gives me access to Inner Strength, basically the only defence-boosting I have available in Spirit. Suddenly I have a defender with 3 def and infinite health.

I did have to weaken the deck slightly and chuck in some Lore cards with Song of Wisdom, as I felt that mono-spirit would struggle on Rhosgobel unless it got lucky with the Athelas.

But first up was Journey Along the Anduin… My first attempt was derailed when I decided to advance to stage 2 (using A Elbereth on the troll) before I had the contract flipped, and before I had Herugrim out. I was overwhelmed in staging and couldn't deal with the enemies quickly enough. Lesson learned!

Attempt 2 was better managed, and I was coasting to victory when disaster struck! The last card revealed on Stage 3 was the second copy of Goblin Sniper. With both copies in the staging area, I would never be able to optionally engage them. Normal practice in this situation is to raise threat to 48 and engage them by force. But with the Ring, I threat out at 45! I was doomed!

So I returned with 2 tokens, and tried again. I got the classic turn 2 double Hill-Troll, though fortunately could cancel it with The Master Ring. I was able to get my attachments on, and looked set to go. But an early Goblin Sniper which I couldn't engage set me up for a nervous game - if the second came out before I could isolate it, I would be stuck again! Fortunately my luck held, and I was able to dispose of the sniper during stage 2. I had the massive contract willpower to sweep through stage 2 after that, and stage 3 left me with just Eastern Crows and Wolf-Rider from the reveal, who were summarily dispatched.

Journey Along the Anduin: 2 tokens.

But now for the real test!

Made the journey to Rhosgobel. This was the first time playing the scenario one-handed, and if I had done so, I would definitely have packed a third Athelas. The first run was going too well. I drew Good Meal and Galadhrim's Greeting in the opening hand for a starting threat of 22. I quickly played Master of the Forge, starting to dig out my own Athelas, but only just when it was too late for Wilyador (hitting six wounds after finding the first and 11 after the second). As for the groves where athelas grew in abundance, they were nowhere to be seen, until at the very last moment at 19 wounds. One valar token.

The second try was very much like the first. I kept finding athelas in the decks a turn too late, but when I was at 12 wounds with one Athelas, I drew the jackpot from the encounter deck. Athelas, guarded by Athelas for a quick two Athelas. I blitzed the quest for victory.

Journey to Rhosgobel is a very weird quest. If you tech for it, it is too easy. If you semi-tech for it, it is down to luck of the draw in solo-mode. With bad luck, the valar tokens could have piled up indefinitely.

Thanks to Dale for organizing this. It will not be the last time I enter. I had great fun trying to build for three quests, rather than one or an entire cycle. It hit an unexplored spot for me and opened up yet another way to play this amazing game.

I think a Guarded Objective, cannot be Guarded by another Guarded Objective, you have to reveal another encounter card to fulfill the first Guarded (while the second objective is put into play free).

That is what I meant. I guarded both objectives, just to not mess up. I drew into a bat and an enchanted wood, but I was already tip-toeing to not quest, so I could travel by exhausting Merry, and I had Unexpected Courages out for both rangers to grab the Athelases after engaging the bat. Threat was at 20 due to Merry's ability and two greetings.

Question: I do recall reading some thread OR FAQ on guarded-on-guarded cards where you resolve both, in effect put the second objective in play and keep drawing for Guarded on both cards. Maybe someone will beat me to it.

 

The FAQ says:

Surge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur is revealed from the encounter deck, including during setup.

I interpret this as both Guarded cards are resolved independently, drawing me two additional encounter cards.

Edited June 18 by Fredmans74
apparently profane non-contextual meaning for a synonym to grab

## 39 [Adaepholn on June 18, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308862-solo-league-22-coremirkwood-with-lotr-saga-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3952918)

I have always played it by revealing a card to guard both objectives. If I revealed an Athelas as the guarding card for an Athelas I would reveal another card to guard the original Athelas, then reveal a 2nd card to guard the 2nd copy of Athelas.

I just checked the FAQ for guarded and couldn't find anything on it.   

As you reveal cards after a guarded card is revealed, if you reveal another Guarded card I don't see why you should ignore the Guarded keyword on the 2nd card. 

From the Rules of Play, page 24 under Guarded: "If another objective cards comes up while attaching a card for the guarded keyword, place the second objective in the staging area, and use the next card of the encounter deck to fulfill the original keyword effect"

Also from the same page: "The Guarded keyword is a reminder on some objective cards to reveal and attach the next card of the encounter deck to the objective when it enters the staging area from the encounter deck and place them both in the staging area"

I don't think it's very clear from that paragraph what you should do, but as it doesn't explicitly state the Guarded keyword on the 2nd objective is ignored I would lean towards both objectives receiving a guarding card. That does mean you could have a round with 4 copies Athelas revealed each with an encounter card leading to a possibly horrendous situation.

 

Unrelated comment -  I think it is very interesting to see the other decks people have come up with for this league. Personally I built my deck with the hope it could beat Journey along the Anduin and A Journey to Rhosgobel easily, and just hoped for the best on Escape from Dol Guldur. Maybe that wasn't the best plan in hindsight :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I found that interesting too. I built exclusively for Dol Guldur and Anduin, hoping to beat Rhosgobel quite easily, since I thought of it as easier than it turned out to be. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] With hindsight, I should have run the deck against Rhosgobel at least once, since I had never played it solo-handed. A couple of Distant Stars could have made a lot of difference, and I could possibly have used them to find that Mountain location that lets you search your top 5 cards in the other two scenarios. At the time of deck-building, I thought it too niche.

I apologize for the late status update, as I've been away camping most of this week and had to hike to the trading post just to keep the Hills of Emyn Muil quest going.

The first quest (Anduin) went smoothly for me, as I had a Winged Guardian in my opening hand.  This let me chump the troll without taking a ton of threat, and with the help of TaEowyn's special ability I was able to take the troll down early.  After that it was just a matter of trying to quest through the second stage before I threated out; the encounter deck was kind enough to give me one enemy per turn (engaged and dispatched) and I made it through unscatched.  That was good for sixth against this quest (outside cards in parens):

0 Alonewolf87 (0)

1 Matt K 22 (6)
1 weaponx117 (39)
2 Trumpet95 (39)

Alonewolf should be the top result based on the third tiebreaker, but I failed to specify core/Mirkwood in the second tiebreaker as I had intended to, so the written rules unfairly drop him to third against this quest for using three core [mandatory] heroes.  Grievous and adaepholn go to the 5th tiebreaker, which wants only core/Rhosgobel cards in the deck.  adaepholn has 21 and Grievous has 16, so adaepholn wins that one and comes in first against this quest.  All other players are distinguish by tokens or outside cards.

Here's the most popular mandatory heroes in the players so far:

4 SpEowyn
3 Beravor
2 LeAragorn
1 LoDenethor
1 Thalin
1 Theodred

Still over a week left to join (if necessary) and finish the three quests.

Once again I'm late in providing a status update -- please finish up your quests by the 28th, and I will post final results on the 29th.

Escape from Dol Goldur I thought would be the worst of the lot, notoriously unbalanced against one-deck solo, requiring incredible luck (and the right hero to be captured) in order to proceed.  In fact, I considered using the spoiled contract from the final AP just so I could [o]have three heroes left over after the capture[/o].  The value of tokens in the quest are somewhat limited due to the one-ally-per-turn limitation, so combined with the luck of the hero capture I was envisioning higher tokens taken than in previous quests, such as the 20 tokens a player took against Black Serpent last month, or even the 50 tokens I took to defeat Dunland Trap a few months ago.  (In fairness, I nearly won at both 2 and 3 tokens before losing on the final shadow card of the quest, but blowing it all up with 50 was sweet revenge...)

My fear of Dol Goldur was based on theory-crafting only, I'd never even tried playing a single deck against it before.  The initial reveals of Necromancer's Pass, King Spider, and Caught in the Web didn't thrill me.  But I had a secret weapon in my Radagast/TacEowyn Eagles deck -- my mandatory hero, Thalin.  It was Thalin I exhausted to King Spider, Thalin that was caught in a web... and Thalin that was randomly chosen to be the captured hero.  Having lost my least valuable, exhausted, and webbed hero, I struggled through the early questing and eventually got ahead of the quest, thanks to Eowyn's willpower and Radagast's action advantage from playing creatures, and Radagast's Staff was more than ample compensation for the missing resource.  When a second Caught in the Web came out I was able to avoid exhausting Radagast at all while still questing, and when I claimed the response to get Thalin we were able to use TaEowyn's ability to put the Nazgul away in one turn.  The biggest problem ended up being threat, but I managed to push across the finish line at 48 or 49 threat, giving me a 100% lifetime success rate against Dol Goldur with one deck.  I still don't recommend it....

Who was as lucky as me?  Nobody.  But most players had better luck than I would've expected against this quest (outside cards in parens):

I've missed the intermediate standings for quest 2, but I definitely intend to get through all 3 before the final deadline.

Next up was Dol Guldur, which I had specifically built around. Basically the plan was to rush stage 1, free the prisoner, trigger the contract, rush stage 2, rush stage 3 and send the Nazgul packing with A Elbereth Gilthoniel.

I was pleased with the opening draw from the Encounter deck - 2x Enchanted Stream and a Driven by Shadow (whiff!) as the Guarded cards. Frodo was taken prisoner which was... a bit concerning, as it meant I had no real defensive strategy - Merry with the ring + Inner Strength for a 2/2 defender!

My opening hand had 2 copies of Silver Circlet, which at least gave me a fighting chance. That gave Eowyn 6 WP off the bat. 

I had to avoid enemies coming out, and got reasonably lucky - Under the Shadows for 1 temporary threat, and Iron Shackles. I later had to cancel a lowly Dol Guldur Orcs with The Master Ring (oh the shame!), but was able to clear the first two Enchanted Streams at the first opportunity. Then Hummerhorns came out! I didn't mind letting them stew in the staging area with their 1 threat, but they meant I had to get out of here before reaching 40 threat, which is no easy task. 

I cleared stage 1, choosing Cavern Torch as the objective, and committed both heroes to the quest on stage 2. Cavern Guardian! I had to engage it, but fortunately rescued Frodo in the nick of time to defend it. This then released the Nazgul into the staging area, and I figured that I needed the contract now, whatever the consequences. Frodo took the last two objectives, allowing me to trigger the contract. As well as the willpower boost, the healing also proved crucial, allowing me to take the Shadow Key's damage on Frodo rather than threating it off. 

I was also lucky to draw Hobbit Pony at this point - it meant I could hold back Merry for emergency defence depending on what came out. It was a Necromancer's Pass, but the Nazgul's hefty 5 threat meant I still needed Merry to finish quest 2B that round, taking the Cavern Guardian's attack undefended, threating the damage through Frodo.

Onto stage 3, I realised I wouldn't be able to keep up with the "Orc Guards" popping up every round. And my threat was now 39, so I had to win this round or face Hummerhorns. By this point I had A Elbereth in hand, and was able to play Snowmane, and Miruvor on Merry.

I quested with Frodo and Eowyn for a combined 13, and drew Under the Shadow. This was a good draw, a temporary +1 threat, but I was still 3 short of the 7 progress for Stage 3. Thankfully I could commit Merry with Hobbit Pony and put the required progress on, so I just needed to be rid of the Nazgul. So I optionally engaged it, leaving me with Nazgul, Cavern Guardian and Orc Guard engaged. Eowyn was ready from Snowmane, and I used Miruvor to ready Merry.

I think I can choose the order of enemy attacks, so I just need to defend and dispatch the Nazgul. Unfortunately Merry's 2/2 meant I couldn't defend the Nazgul with him, so Eowyn had to be sacrificed. Thankfully the shadow card was Chieftan Ufthak (possibly the only time I've ever been glad to see him!) so the Nazgul's forced effect didn't trigger.

I then played A Elbereth to stick the Nazgul on the bottom of the deck, and at this point I think I win instantly, before the others attack. For completeness, I defended the Guardian with Merry, and took the Orc Guard's 1 attack as threat through Frodo - so if I have misunderstood the rule on order of attacks, we can rest assured I would have won anyway.

 

Who'd have thought I would beat Dol Guldur easier than Anduin? I certainly had a decent time of it from the encounter deck - none of those nasty spiders - but equally I never drew what I thought were key cards, like Herugrim and Snowmane (until later on).

 

Escape from Dol Guldur: 0 tokens.

And I've made it through Rhosgobel. Not a quest which suited my deck at all. I had a few healing tricks, but victory relied on me drawing Song of Wisdom + Healing Herbs or Long Defeat AND the encounter deck spewing forth enough Athelas before Wilyador perishes (and my goodness his health drops fast!).

I managed it on 5 tokens - the starting card draw did help but I don't think the tokens had a massive influence on whether I won or not!

 

Rhosgobel: 5 tokens, for a Grand Total of 7 tokens.

I am very impressed by your run, trumpet. I included A Elbereth with both hill troll and nazgul in mind, but never drew it when I needed it. I have the exact same feeling about Rhosgobel. I was a little light on healing, and was therefore completely at the mercy of the encounter deck giving me the right cards and the deck was so thick. It was never a matter of resources, and at the end of my 1-token run, I had money in piles but not the athelas. Fortunately, I drew two at the same time, which made me win the scenario at the very last moment, but at that point I pictured myself adding a lot of Valar tokens.

## 48 [dalestephenson on June 29, 2020](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308862-solo-league-22-coremirkwood-with-lotr-saga-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3956836)

Journey to Rhosgobel worried me because it was so random, but as I was using outside cards I had a secret weapon -- my Radagast/Eagles deck had 3x Honour Guard, the bane of Journey to Rhosgobel -- you can prevent damage with impunity, unlike repeatable healing.  As long as I was able to get one quickly, I thought I'd be OK.

I also threw 3x Ioreth in, figuring that even though she'd be "removed from the game" in stage two, that'd give me a cheap 1-cost healing event anyways (Ioreth is free to play, but costs a lore resource to heal).

I did get an early Honour Guard, and also Meneldor, which opened up the other cheesy way to win -- by clearing Rhosgobel in staging, I can heal with impunity as long as I stay on stage one, and all Meneldor has to do is enter and leave to clear it.  Oh, and I had Henamarth Riversong early, so I could stay on stage one as long as I liked.

So I was set up to totally nerf the quest, but I had a few problems:
1) Henamarth was essential, and has only one hp.  So my early Honour Guard has to protect Henamarth from damaging treacheries over protecting Wilyador from end-of-turn damage.
2) I needed repeatable healing and it hadn't shown up yet.
3) No Athelas either.

The encounter deck was giving me a steady stream of damaging treacheries, and it was all my Honour Guard could do to keep Henamarth alive.  Eventually the Honour Guard himself ran out of steam, but the other two showed up and they just barely managed to hold the fort -- I saved Henamarth, but I lost Thalin, had to sacrifice a Loyal Hound to save Radagast and used Landroval to bring back TaEowyn.  Meanwhile Wilyador was continuing to get banged up.  He had 18 damage when blessed Ioreth showed up.  Yes, another fragile 1-hp essential, but the damaging treacheries had mostly already been found, and between Honour Guard and Ioreth I steadily made progress in nursing the eagle back to health -- now the issue was threat, since even with Gandalf's help I was closing in fast on fifty.  A Forest Grove *finally* showed up, and once I got the Athelas I advanced to stage two and blasted through it before I threated out.

I never believed that Rhosgobel would be tough with Henamarth and Honour Guard -- but it turned out to be.  A normal deck would've been crushed early.

Unlike Dol Goldur, I had more company at the top this time

I thought my 0-token run was a cinch, but Thanee came out at the last second to snipe me by two cards.  Should've cut my Beorning Skin-Changers, I guess.  Thanee gets to choose the cycle for August's League, and I get to choose a quest from the cycle to play.  Alonewolf87 and General_Grievous both took only two tokens with zero outside cards, but since I miswrote the second tiebreaker and left out the core heroes Grievous gets third place and gets to exclude a quest from August's league -- I'll need to be more careful with that the next time we play Mirkwood!  MattK gets the most help from the Valar, and will get to choose the cycle for supplementary player cards in August.

Join us in July as we go to the LOTR saga and play Flight to the Ford, Breaking of the Fellowship.... and Mount Doom!  (Supplemental player cards are from LR/Angmar)

I will exclude Redhorn Gate so we don’t necessarily have to bring high willpower decks.

RNG has selected Into the Pit and Road to Rivendell, so the mandatory hero list is Bifur, Dwalin, Elladan, and SpGlorfindel.  MattK now chooses the cycle for supplementary player cards.

MattK has chosen VoI/Ringmaker for maximum secrecy potential.

Thanks for setting this up. I will try to participate next league as well. I liked the challenge  of building a deck for three particular quests, and I am currently setting out from Rivendell in my first run-through anyway. I guess I will have to spoil Mount Doom, but I think it would be worth it. KD for August is another league I will try, for sure.
