# [Nazgûl of Minas Morgul](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93961-nazg%C3%BBl-of-minas-morgul/)

Contains Morgul Vale Spoilers ...



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 



After two harrowing attempts at beating Morgul Vale (and two near end-game defeats,) I had a quick question about the third captain, the Nazgûl of Minas Morgul.

 

Below the text that reads there can be not attachments to him, it reads: "Reduce any amount of damage dealt to Nazgûl of Minas Morgul to 1."  So, I was wondering if this meant he could only receive one damage per round or just one damage from altogether different combat actions each round.

 

For example, if I used Gandalf's arriving ability to deal four damage (which equates to one damage to the Nazgûl) at the beginning of the round during the planning phase... Then later in combat phase, I used a hero to deal another amount of damage to him (again brought down to one damage).  Both these events deal one damage to the Nazgûl but on separate occasions throughout one round.  

 

Ideas or thoughts on this?

Since it doesn't say round, your thought was correct.  So you could do a Hail of stones, Gandalf, and then attack to get 3 on him in a round.

I would think you could attack him as many times and different ways as you want.  It's just 1 damage assigned, no matter what, when you do.

Oh, Hail of Stones... Nice idea, I'll have to put that in my deck on my next attempt.  I normally don't have too much trouble taking out Murzag and that filthy traitor Alcaron, but when the Nazgûl arrives, it all goes downhill and I can't seem to take him out quick enough.

Sneak Attack Descendant of Thorondor will do two. Spear of the Citadel one, Goblin Cleaver one for each cast. There are lots of ways to chip him apart.

Is quite difficult to kill this guy quickly……don't  forget +to Nazgul is also other enemies around and you need as well defend and questing as well. He also attack and with his 7 attack power he will kill some one every attack.

Doesn't infighting kill him easilly ?

Moving is not dealing damage as far as I know.

Probably yes. He will die but is also not so easy to do anyway

got Morgul Vale today, and tried it three times, and lost each time. Nice to finally get a quest that I can't beat on the first try!

finally beat it after a couple more attempts, this time with a Legolas/Hama/Beorn tactics deck. That Nazgul is tough. This and the Stewards Fear are definitely the best quests in the cycle, in my opinion.

I just realized that I may have missed an important detail:

 

Murzag and Lord Alcaron do not have victory points.

 

When they are defeated, neither the quest nor the captain cards provide special rules for their removal from the game. Are they simply added to the encounter discard pile?  Can they return to fight alongside the Nazgul? Gosh, that would be horrible.

I noticed that too.  Personally, I took them out of play anyways because I felt that thematically, it made more sense if they were dead rather than wounded and able to return later.

In Polish version is wrong  translated the card  Nazgul,  text reads: Reduce by one, each number of the damage inflicted Nazgul from Minas Morgul. So we have the easier.

Earlier badly translated the Book of Mazarbul card - attached hero cannot attack and exhaust to commit to a quest (so before we had  a more difficult).

In the case of the Book of Mazarbul I played as translated (harder). So now  I choose an original version of the Nazgul (also difficult) - This is final AP, and finally this is Nazgul, it should be hard to kill him  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

That is easier, indeed!  Heck, lots of characters or abilities could take him out in one attack even after reducing that attack's damage by one.  I haven't tried this quest again, but am determined to beat it.

This was a question with the Khazad-dum expansion and its Patrol Leader, as well.  I had never seen an official response... so I just got one!

 

Official response:

 

"Any time you would place damage on an enemy, that damage is "dealt" to that enemy. So even if you "move" damage to the Nazgul of Minas Morgul using Infighting, that damage is still "dealt" for the purposes of resolving the Nazgul's ability (which reduces it to 1). Furthermore, if a Morgul Bodyguard is in play, damage that would be moved to a Captain enemy would have to be placed on a Bodyguard instead.

Hope you're enjoying the scenario!

Cheers,

Caleb"

 

So there you have it.  Infighting won't help you more than any other card.

Thanks for asking.

 

Still, Dwarrowdelf Axes should deal the after attack damage.

Stand Together with 3 Gonrian Spearmen with Spear and Beregond with a Spear should take care of him too.

So many possibilities...

Hey GrandSpleen, how do you ask and receive answers directly from Caleb?

Not that I have looked it up or sent a rules question about this but at first look I would say that all that passive damage would still be reduced to 1 on the basis that, as it seems to me, all defenders are declared at the same time and all the damage is calculated at the same time.

Much like a joined attack by your characters are declared at the same time, I expect the timing is similar in that regard when you use Stand Together.

Just my opinion here as well,

I think you are right in terms of defending characters declaring to defend at the same time when Stand Together is used, but I would argue each responses would be resolved seperately in any order First Player chooses.

 

Just like when you have Legolas with Blade of Gondolin and happened to kill an enemy using Legolas when only 1 more progress token is required to complete a quest, First Player may choose to resolve Blade of Gondolin's response first and move on to next stage of the quest, then resolve Legolas' response to place 2 progress tokens on the new quest card even though both Legolas and Blade of Gondolin's response was triggered at the same time.

Quite a good point.

Makes me more curious as to what Caleb would have to say on this.
