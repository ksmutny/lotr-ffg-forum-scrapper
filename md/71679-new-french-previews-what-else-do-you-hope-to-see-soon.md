I want to see a Dwarf or a Ranger!

Seeing Balin or Oin would be my preference, but any Gondor hero or ally or any unique drawf would make me happy.

 

What do you want to see?

 I really don't get why people assume previews always happen in mondays. I have read this in these forums a lot, yet in those mondays (and none that I remember) no previews were given. Am I missing something?

We usually get a Monday article (you can look back at the dates of the  past news for the game) but there's been a bit of a break in the past couple months because of the end of a cycle, GenCon, and the lack of an immediately upcoming Adventure Pack.

Same here, though I doubt they will publish an article today. i guess FFG is not really rigorous with their timeline?

correiosThere isn't much to write a article about right now. I also want to see new previews and such, but I don't time my life in accordance to FFG's posts. haha :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
 Go read richsabre's posts about Middle-Earth, those are great time sinks!

Maybe FFG will announce that the new battle of Laketown POD is available ?

## 9 [BoundForGlory on September 25, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71679-new-french-previews-what-else-do-you-hope-to-see-soon/?do=findComment&comment=700262)

 I heard a rumor from another country's website that Battle of Lake-Town will release in November, along with Numenor.

I'm guessing that leaves Hobbit 2 to release in December with the movie.

Since there is nothing releasing in October, maybe they are only releasing articles every 2-3 weeks, instead of every week like they did when an expansion was releasing every month.

They could also preview the first pack from Against the shadow in this time lapse…

Oh excellent!

Beregond is a beast with an affinity for Weapon and Armor enchantments.

I think there will be some new Gondor and/or Dúnedain weapons for him in the new cycle.

 From FFG's French website I think. I found them while googling around :-)

I like them both, but I think Beregond looks too clean. That being said, he is of the Tower Guard of the White City, so I guess he ought to be.

Also Beregond is # 1 in the box and the Emissary (Neutral Ally) is #18. Given one more hero (#2, hopefully Faramir as depicted in the background here [http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_npm_sec.asp?eidm=157&esem=1] ), that leaves as many as 15 non-neutral player cards. My list (here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=724148], tracking the new cards as they are released) so far shows 6, so at least 9 more player card spoilers to go, maybe more if there are neutral attachments (which I think is a good possibility)

Orc Crossbowmen [http://i35.servimg.com/u/f35/12/65/99/36/s0187017.jpg]

 

ALSO! This was shown on the French (Edge) FFG website!

Orc Crossbowmen

Dadajef explains that this has a new keyword Archery X which means that you have to deal out X direct damage to characters, you choose. This card says that X is the number of different resource icons of heroes in play.

I like this card and the art is awesome! It's drawn by Timo Karhula who made the Shadow and Flame box cover art depicting the Balrog!

Much agreed about the art-work!  In looking at that card, and the ones on the link John85 posted, it looks like the level has been stepped up yet again, and without relying solely on "Mags"…

 That archery keyword is nasty for me as I like to use Aragorn with the Sword and the Stone and other songs on my heroes as well.

I also love the artwork and new archery keyword. Really remind me old Decipher lotr tcg. I use to play this game a lot and there was archery phase when enemies and heroes and allies shoot to each other before they come close to skirmish. I also think new deluxe and next cycle should be awesome.

I wonder how archery work??? when revealed they should? Most probably. Or in Combat?

C'est vrai que le Mordor n'est pas loin. Archerie X ça veut dire qu'au début de chaque phase de combat (tant que les arbalétriers sont en jeu) tu dois répartir X points de dégats parmi tous les personnages en jeu. Les joueurs décident entre eux la façon de répartir ses dégâts et s'ils ne sont pas d'accord c'est le premier joueur qui tranche. Comme pour tout effet de blessure directement infligé par une carte la défense des personnages n'est pas prise en compte !

 

This is a direct quote from Dadajef post when he revealed the cards.

 

This means that the Archery keyword triggers it's effect at the begginig of the combat phase.

OK it make a sense. But another question : how is work? Enemies in staging area will shoot or not? Or only enemies engage with a players?

Staging area enemies will shoot first player or doesn shoot either? Enemies engage a players should shoot only player with whom they are engage right?

 For what i uunderstand, just the enemy with archery keyword attacks, and they all decide together in which characters they put the damage.

 

I do not have the answer to your last question, but as my interpretation of Dadajef post, it's when they are in play.

 

To full answer of those questions, we will have to wait.

Thanks for your answer pal. I love archery idea and cannot wait for new deluxe and cycle.

I think it would be pretty bloody low-handed of FFG to allow archery to function from the staging area.  Our archery cannot attack to the staging area, only with engaged enemies.  I would be royally pissed if they gave that huge of an advantage to the staging area enemies without ALSO errating the rules for Free People characters with archery to be able to attack to the staging area as well.

ranged cannot attack in staging area- but with hands upon the bow it looks as if the true archery awaits us in terms of cards…

maybe this archery thing will only work if there is a battleground in play, or something like that. that would make sense.

if you have a battleground up and a load of enemies in the staging area, then it would be good if arrows are flying back and forth. but in something like "the hunt for gollum", which is in the forest, or down in the mines of khazad-dum, it doesnt make as much sense to let us use arrows against enemies we havent engaged yet.

although i do think it would be good if they introduced that rule, because solo players might at last get some good use out of ranged characters

Doh.  Thanks for the catch.  Ranged is, of course, what I was meaning.  The hazards of checking the forums while at work and not paying attention enough…
