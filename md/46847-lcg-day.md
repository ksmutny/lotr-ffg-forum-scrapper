Hi

Did anyone here attend this event?

If so, what was the Epic Scenario all about and was there any news/info in the Q&A session?

Cheers

Geoff

Will FFG publish the epic scenario as a downloadable 'gift' scenario on their site? Would be a nice nod to the community :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Hello,

 

   Sorry to disappoint you all,  but the epic scenario was just the "nightmare" level challenge as detailed in the rule book: running all 3 scenarios back-to-back.

   And unfortunately my train coming into MSP was way late and I missed out on attending the Q&A, so I can't shed any light on that.

There's been some discussion about how to run a "nightmare" scenario. Did you get any official instructions there on how to do that?

Thanks for the news.

Sad there wasn't anything new but glad that I didn't miss anything.

Cheers

Geoff
