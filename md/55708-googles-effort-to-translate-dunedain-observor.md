 A bilingual German/English player on Boardgamegeek translated it to "Reaction: Discard Dunedain Observer to cancel the shadow effects of a card that just triggered."  Personally, until I see the actual English card, of course, I think that "discard" is far more likely that "exhaust."

It says: "Response: Discard Dunedain observer to cancel shadow effects of cards just triggered"

It is definitely discard, not exhaust. What puzzles me is that it refers to shadow effects and cards (both plural) which could be or not a translation error from the German publisher or it is phrased in this way to include Beastmaster of Dol Guldur and other multiple shadow card effects (??)

My friend just let me know that the English language version of the card reads "Response: Discard Dunedain Watcher from play to cancel the shadow effects of a card just triggered."  So it looks like the plural is in both translations?

Is it a leadership card like the other Dunedain cards? I'm just asking because effect cancellation seems to be more a spirit kind of thing.

It is a Leadership ally, yes.  Here's a visual spoiler of the German version http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/713677/available-in-essen/page/2 [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/713677/available-in-essen/page/2]

You're right. This effect should include the beastmaster of DG and future cards which raises the amount of dealt shadow card.

Is it confirmed that the english cardtext is written in plural? The german is, recieved my copy of "Die Totensümpfe" yesterday

Judging from what Lightdarker said I'd say it cancels out all shadow effects (plural) on a (as in just one) card just dealt. Cunfusing. I don't think you can use it to cancel out both shadow cards dealt to Beastmaster DG cause then you'd cancel the effects on more than just one card AND since Bearsmaster cannot be "just dealt" unless he's dealt as a shadow card.

@OnkelZorni: The English version of the card reads as follows:

"Response: Discard Dunedain Watcher from play to cancel the shadow effects of a card just triggered."

@mr.thomasschmidt: This card is a little peculiarly phrased, but I think I agree completely with you.  You cancel all of the "effects" of a single (shadow) card that were just triggered.

An encounter card alone does not have any shadow effects, but shadow cards do (and something like a DG Beastmaster has more than one shadow card).  I suppose one shadow card could have more than one "effect, but it seems easy to argue that the "effect" of a shadow card in some cases may simply do more than one thing... which is especially confusing because Hasty Stroke simply reads "cancel a shadow effect just triggered during combat." I would have assumed that FFG would have simply re-used that phrasing for Dunedain Watcher, but in any case, I think what they were going for seems clear enough (discard the ally to cancel 1 shadow card).
