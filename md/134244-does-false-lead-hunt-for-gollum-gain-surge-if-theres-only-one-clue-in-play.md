False Lead reads, "When Revealed: The first player chooses and shuffles a card with a printed Clue trait back into the encounter deck. If there are no Clue cards in play, False Lead gains surge."

 

Say there is only one Clue card in play, and False Lead is revealed. False Lead's own effect shuffles the Clue back into the encounter deck. Since there's no longer any Clue cards in play, does False Lead gain surge now?

 

Or does the surge effect only happen if there were no Clue cards in play when False Lead was revealed (i.e. False Lead doesn't shuffle any Clues back into the encounter deck)?
