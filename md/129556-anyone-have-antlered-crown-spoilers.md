I see this is available at CSI. Â Anybody have the remaining spoilers for this set?

The Antlered Crown is probably the only pack I've been as interested in the encounter cards as well as the player cards. I really wanna see spoilers.

I imagine spoilers will be up soon. Mine just got shipped from CSI yesterday and I should expect it by Tuesday. Can't wait. I'm really curious who the hero is.

I was hoping to see some spoilers soon. The pack hits next week.
