How did you find that image of the Arkham Horror LCG?

I'm with Jhaleen now. It's a fake.

1. JSBingsley's post was the first one on the entire internet about an Arkham Horror LCG, yet in his op he assumed we knew about it.

2. People were accusing him of being drunk when he started that thread, so it would be logical if he were to create a fake to back it up. (If it isn't a fake, them I am sorry and will delete this post).

3. There is no product code.

4. You can't see the designers names. Suspicious.

5. The screenshot doesn't show what site it was found on, just the box and description. Not to mention it doesn't have a "preorder now" or something that an online retailer would have (assuming it is an online retailer, because the format is similar to one.).

Star Wars was originally intended to be cooperative, with players as Rebel leaders playing against an Imperial deck, but Empire fans won the right to play too.

I think it would be cool if FFG could somehow wrangle the Harry Potter IP and make a co-op LCG game out of that. Maybe have it be similar to LotR where your heroes have to balance committing to the "quest" with doing other things, perhaps in this case attending class! Instead of the spheres there would be the different houses of Hogwarts... I'm not really a huge HP fan but it seems like it could work quite well and be quite popular  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

I guess at least with Arkham Horror, they are more free to do what they want with the IP. Assuming the screenshot is actually legit.

I just wouldnt want JK Rowling making any more money though. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

While I do not think her books are well written and there are countless better fantasy (or kids) works available, I honestly cannot take away from the massive achievement she has had by getting young kids reading..... however.... she just grates against me for the things she says/claims in public. I once watched a tv interview of her where she genuinely said that while she didnt invent the creature of Hypogryph, as it was from myths and legends, that there was nothing at all written about them and so she had to make up a lot about them and she was the first to do this. I watched this while looking over at my shelf of D&D books, Fighting Fantasy books, Warhammer books and countless others full of fictional/mythic information about Hypogryphs. It just made me angry she said she was the first.

Ive also seen her claim so much originality in her setting without any mention of Diana Wyne Jones' Christomanci series or Jill Murphy's Worst Witch series. It just rubs me up the wrong way.

Sorry, soapbox moment.

Getting kids reading is awesome though and I cant take that away from her.

Jim Butcher seems very approachable and friendly, so it could happen. But having a deal with Evil Hat already probably is enough for one author. Tangential relation: Jim was inspired by Tolkien's works to become a writer.

 

I wonder how close to CoC they would make it in structure, if this AH LCG were a real thing. There could be something like the spheres of LotR, but it would probably be called something like "expertise" (practical, martial, arcane, mythos knowledge?) or some other less mystical name. The theme and setting would probably be much like the other post-CoC Arkham products, in that you play the "good guys", or the ones who think they are anyway. So there would be independent investigators, law enforcement, scholars and even some sorcerers from The Order as the obvious choices. No cultists, as they'd belong in the encounter decks.

 

It would serve them well to bring over the general structure of LotR, with encounter decks created from different sets of cards for more variety in scenarios. I'd also hope for a campaign format where each scenario has a reward to bring with you to the next (saga style). Maybe also a sanity mechanic, with a hard difficulty where that doesn't regenerate in campaigns.

 

Although in the general Cthulhu Mythos survival is often the best reward you could hope for :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I still can't find the source of the original pic and its poster hasn't replied. Considering L5R is the next upcoming LCG, as well as the bad quality and grammar of the displayed item and text,I have to to consider this pic a hoax. Perhaps the OP was a victim of trolling himself, I don't know. There is only rumour spreading for now.

That being said I'd love to see another co op LCG doing its own thing and expanding alongside Lotr.

The D&D Adventure Boardgame System is fully Co-Op and completely DM-less and I find awesome fun.

True it will never have the depth of full DnD but it makes a pretty good shot at it with including a lot of the monsters/traps/environments/events/bosses/spells/ambushes/conditions etc etc within a ridiculously simple rule system.

A lot of people consider them too simple but I think the simplicity helps and the scope of what they managed to include was impressive.

4 boardgames within the system, all different but all same rules. Any and all can be combined or substituted for your own adventures. Each comes without about 13 adventures/missions and there is a ton of fan created content out there on the Web.

If you like DnD dungeon crawl they are worth a look :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm sorry guys.

First the answer to Took:

The pic I uploaded is from a player who plays COC LCG, and he didn't tell me where it's from.

The pic I uploaded is just a part of a bigger pic. From the other part of the pic, I guess it's an email from FFG.

 

Still, I don't know whether the pic is true, but I'm sure it's not PSed by me :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

L5r is the next known lcg and this is only because of the nature of the sale of the IP. If it wasn't for that we would not know it was coming in 2017.

Thank you. Last year FFG announced Five Rings for this year. I think it's entirely plausible that they would announce AH LCG for next year. If it is a year away I wouldn't expect too many details. I hope they ask for playtesters though...

If this is a hoax - at some level, I'm not accusing Bingly because I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt - it's pretty well executed. I think it's possible that FFG planted this to see the reaction, but it's equally likely that they saw the reaction and decided to make an official no comment reaction and are now deciding if they want to run with it.

I hope they run with it.

Would that mean that LOTR LCG would end though? I apologize for repeating this and I think it's unlikely, but just to be sure. Do they not have a limited quantity of LCG's they're willing to maintain at a time?

 

A Lovecraft solo LCG would be incredible, regardless.

Just like there is room for multiple competitive LCGs (and there are many of them, perhaps too many), there is still a market share for 2 coop card games. Why have 1 top selling game when you can have two? After all, just because its coop doesnt mean it has too be a copy-pasted version of LoTR. Like netrunner vs AGot2.0 there is room to appreciate both.

Remember that the only LCGs they've shut down so far have been dwindling in popularity for years and L5R which will be coming out soon won't be replacing another LCG.

1 LCG doesn't have to die for another to live. In AH LCG case it might have been CoC LCG anyway.

People need to stop thinking that just because we are getting the last Saga expansion the game will end. Its not a board game. Its original premise is that it takes place before the books specifically so that the game will have longevity.

All right, I'll give Bingly the benefit of the doubt. Sorry mate! It's still a hoax, but it might not be HIS hoax.

> Would that mean that LOTR LCG would end though? I apologize for repeating this and I think it's unlikely, but just to be sure. Do they not have a limited quantity of LCG's they're willing to maintain at a time?

 

During his latest InFlight report (GenCon, 2015), during the Q&A time, Chris Petersen (now ANA CEO) said clearly that they don't want to mantain too many LCG lines, but that there's still space for something new (I don't recall the exact words - if you look on the Team Covenant youtube channel you have the whole Q&A and you can verify the source), so that let's say if they have 6 lines running they could keep the number to 6 or to 7, but they'll never go to 10 or 11. So, yeah, having one more doesn't imply one line has to die.

 

This said, everything's really "shoulda coulda woulda", time will tell. But in any case LotR is still selling a lot, so, why stop milking a good cow?

Nope. They announced L5R for 2017, so, next year. The announcement was done to state widely they own the IP and they will develop games in the IP, including a LCG.

Could you tell us who that player is? So that we can hunt them down!

No one needs to be hunted down if it is a true product.

We can hunt them down to find out if it is true I meant.

Unless they have either realized their error in letting this slip on their own or gotten in trouble for spilling things ahead of time by FFG. .

I hope that we get Arkham Horror LCG game. Honestly, I am quite optimistic about it. FFG had leaks before (see Relic, it leaked months before announcement). Anyway, Arkham Horror is a big name in the board game community. Why discard it? Make a card game and it will sell like cakes (especially as LCG).

Assuming it's real, will GenCon be the announcement with maybe some playable demos?  Or will it be a GenCon surprise early release?

If its real... and then if ffg staff might be thus reading this, then don't wait for gencon, announce now and let the hype escalate in the wait for gencon, the excitement, buzz and thus publicity will be phenomenal leading to a lot of gencon attention.

If it's real, if you're reading, then ride the wave, take advantage of the current fan-buzz about this, here, cardgamedb, boardgamegeek etc.

The buzz has been excellent publicity, but for best advantage, an official titbit would fuel things so much better.

Go on ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

Yeah, it is in their best interest to ride the hype wave now with a few previews, because if they wait till Gencon, the hyped will have died down and it will be old news when they reveal it.

Old news are good, the Lovecraft fans will be excited to focus on the annoucement.
