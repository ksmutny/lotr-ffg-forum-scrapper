Hello all

Just have a question in regards to questing

When you successfully quest and you have the required amount of progress tokens on the card do you

Reveal the next quest card and resolve any texts on that card?

Or do you wait until you have resolved the travel and combat phase before revealing the next quest card?

Many thanks

Quest progression is a passive effect which will kick in, the instant the requirements are met. 

This means that once you have met all requirements, you put everything else on hold because passive effects will always resolve first.

The order of resolving effects is: passive -> forced -> when revealed -> action

Right now I´m thinking I might have forgotten one but I´m sure someone will correct me if I have :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

So if I'm on the quest card, I have an enemy engaged with me from the last round and Im now back to the quest stage only needing 1 progress token. I get the remaining progress token and complete the final quest card, do I leave this enemy or do I still have to fight him?

Cheers for the reply

At that point it would depend on what the victory conditions are. If it just says, "If players complete this stage, they have won the game," then it doesn't matter what's engaged with you, in the staging area, etc, you've won. If it says something like "If players complete this stage and there are no enemies in play, players have won the game," then you would have to place the set amount of progress, and be clear of enemies.

Enemies engaged with you and cards in the staging area are unaffected when you complete a quest card, unless the card specifically says otherwise.
