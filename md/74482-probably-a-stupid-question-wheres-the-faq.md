It's been a few years since I tried to find an FAQ for a card game. But I thought it would be attached to the top of the forum?  Please tell me what simple thing I'm missing.  I just bought a core set and am looking forward to playing the game correctly.

Thank you!  A friend and I will be playing before the Thanksgiving meal (probably after the turkey's in the oven) and I really wanted to know all the ins and outs.
