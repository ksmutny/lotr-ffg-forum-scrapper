If you have 2 threat, and then cast say Greating... dose your threat go to -4 ? If so how is that scored? dose that count as -4 during the scoring? as for example 104+(-4) = 100 ? 

Like as far as i know the rules do not say anything about negative numbers... and ion the scoring rule amendment it says to just add them up...

Anyway here are the 2 scores.. let me know witch one I should put in my Log...

Long Quest - Conflict at the Carrock - RESTRICTED = 144

or is it

Lone Quest - Conflict at the Carrock - RESTRICTED = 140

Score Break Down....

Final Threat = 0 , -4

Add Threat Cost of Each Dead Hero = +0

Add Damage Tokens on remaining Heroes = +0

Minus Victory Points = -6

Add Turn Cont  times 10 = 150.

So... 

0+0+0-6+150 = 144

-4+0+0-6+150 = 140

?? Witch score is correct?

I guess it is safe to assume, that you cannot drop below 0 threat since there is no way to represent a negative threat with the game components.

And additionally it would ridicule the scoring system again, because it is possible to play 3+ sneaked Gandalfs per round, which leads to infinite negative scores.
