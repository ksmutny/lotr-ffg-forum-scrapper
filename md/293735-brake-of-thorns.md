When setting up Mount Doom, it says to make Brake of Thorns the active location. On Brake of Thorns, it says "forced: after brake of thorns becomes the active location, each player assigns x damage amongst characters he controls."

Unfortunately, that triggers, correct? Basically you start the game with three damage on your heroes (if you have three of them)?

Well X depends on your starting threat if I am not mistaken so it could be less than that, but yeah it triggers.
