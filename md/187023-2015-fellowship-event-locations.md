You sure you got the address in Seattle right? Maps says that's a coffee shop. Did you mean to add card kingdom?

Uptown Espresso is the right place.  We have bi-weekly game nights there.  I don't believe Card Kingdom is hosting.

No freaking kidding!

And I've been playing solo all these years cause no gamestore said they have a group that plays!

This is great news!  Thanks!

I know, right? I was just like you until this group started last year. If you're not busy this weekend, we are playing this Sunday at 6. If you're on Facebook, here's where we coordinate events, share news, etc https://www.facebook.com/groups/1508287562747166/ [https://www.facebook.com/groups/1508287562747166/].

Added Tulsa, Oklahoma to the list.

Added Austin, TX to the list. We actually are holding two separate Fellowship events, I will confirm the date of the second event tonight.

Geek City Games in Coralville, IA has been added

It's funny, on the local web store LotR LCG is listed as a "hit" (meaning a lot of people buy it), but when I asked that retailer to host the Fellowship event, he instantly refused and ceased and further discussion about it.

## 11 [Raven1015 on September 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187023-2015-fellowship-event-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1772368)

I'm always surprised to hear so many stories of game stores being s%$#y about hosting these events.

## 12 [John Constantine on September 3, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187023-2015-fellowship-event-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1772376)

I would understand their hesitance to host an event if LotR LCG was not popular around, but their own site claims it to be a "hit". And by refusing to host the event so harsly, they make me question the credibility of the whole "hit" thing. However, there is no alternative convinient way to get anything boardgame related around here, so little I can do about it.

Have game stores hosting been given info? GameKastle in the Bay Area applied to take part but (as I understand it) has had no confirmation...

## 14 [Raven1015 on October 13, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187023-2015-fellowship-event-locations/?do=findComment&comment=1845791)

It seems that some have and some haven't. Truth be told, FFG organized play can be a bit disorganized sometimes (heh). Anyway, which Game Kastle applied? If they get accepted, I might have to mosey down there if Games of Berkeley doesn't get it.

Freemont one!

Hopefully at least one of the two gets it because I have never had a chance to attend one before (rural england wasn't too keen on these!) and I've been waiting avidly for 6 months for this event!

Not even one in Australia.... what a surprise lol...

You play at Fremont? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] Who is this? Have I met you? haha I'd be so down!

Sadly I don't play at Fremont although I do play with Kevin at work. I live in the Southbay so frequent trips up to Freemont in the week are a bit tricky. I hadn't realized there was such a great community there so I may try and head up more often.

Cool, I'm up in danville so I don't get down tooooo offten but I'd be down to play occasionally! Especially at a fellowship event like this. Hope one is going on around us.

I wish FFG would send the kits out or whatever.  I don't know if the store I got to order the kits will get it in or not... and it would be nice to know.  How can I drum up support and get people to show up if the store doesn't know if they're even going to get the kits to host the event?

I have seen this kind of thing with other companies, it's hard to prioritise what is (usually) a loss leader like this when human resources are already pretty thinly stretched, but at the same time, it really is super important, especially to the hardcore fans who tend to get others into the hobby. Hopefully FFG will get to it soon. I know there are a ton of other tournaments getting going now as well. I think LotR:LCG is a bit niche by comparison.

Thanks Narsil!

Sent an email, hopefully I get in in time!

I don't want to add this officially, but I was chatting with a worker at the Uncommons in NYC tonight, and apparently they will have the stuff available for a Fellowship event but weren't convinced it would be popular enough to actually run an official one. So they were just going to run it for themselves, essentially. But if enough interest could be drummed up, they would consider making it public again (although perhaps not on the official event weekend).

 

So, NYC LotR LCG players unite! If you might be able to attend, show your support by sending them a declaration of interest here:

I have added the address of the store where we will receive the event!
So far we are the only Spanish speakers that will do to date!
OH YEAH!

Sunday, November 15th we start at noon at Emerald Tavern on Burnet and the 183 frontage road. The Emerald Tavern event has two spots still available and a $25 entry fee.

Added the event for the Dutch city Groningen, de Purperen Draak will be hosting this event. They relocate this week, so it will probably be the first 'big' event in their new store. So excited for the event!!

I'll be attending my own event in Iowa, but I've added the FFG Event Center and Madison, WI to the map
