Spirit Glorfindel

"Forced:  After Glorfindel exhausts to commit to a quest, raise your threat by 1."

 

Late Adventurer

"Quest Action:  Exhaust a character you control that is not comnmited to the quest to commit that character to the quest."

 

If you play Late Adventurer on Spirit Glorfindel, does his Forced text trigger or is he instead considered to be exhausting for Lare Adventurer and not the quest?

I would say that his text triggers. Late Adventurer says "to commit that character to the quest" so LA is making Glorfindel commit.  If LA said "Exhaust a character you control that is not committed to the quest.  That character is now committed to the quest" then I would say that his text wouldn't trigger, because LA would be doing the committing… but as it exists, LA is allowing the character to commit, so… Glorfindel's going to trigger off his own text.

 Agreed with JasonRed.

 

But you can have it passed with Light of Valinor.

Light of Valinor makes Spirit Glorfindel amazing. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Indeed. And Asfaloth was also "build to him"…

 

But it can make Elrond (inspite his high threat)…quest, defend or attack

That's really the tough choice for the table… where do you put it?  Glorfindel makes sense… but Elrond is better, especially if you want to use Narya.

Would be a tough call if playing them both together.  So the answer is get LoV on Glorfindel (to prevent the threat) and get a UC on Elrond.  Problem solved ;-)
