There has to be a Tower of the Swan. It'd be a massive troll if there wasn't.

 

And I just noticed there isn't. Maybe it was too obvious?

Mighty Warrior from the upcoming Mumakill pack will give him that trait. Bringing new levels of jank to the Gloin deck!

these are some interesting cards.   Vigilant Guard could be very fun on ally Boromir.

Legolas (and some others) have the Silvan and Warrior traits,  so Vigilant Guard on them combined with Silvan Tracker gives you a lot of easy healing.

I'm liking both cards a whole lot more now.

For me, it's considerably weaker to be called "leadership feint".

 

You need to have a Noble character waste his action to defend, you can't kill the enemy after you do, and you have to deal with that enemy's threat on the following turn, opposed by single resource in feint's case. Especially when there are almost no Noble allies, so you'll be wasting a hero action in 99% of times. I'd rather just defend the attack and kill the attacker afterwards.

I'll agree that it's weaker than feint, and that if you can successfully defend and kill the enemy that would usually be much better -- further if you can successfully defend, even if you can't counterattack is generally preferable to leave them engage rather than have them contribute to staging.

 

However, it's obviously useful in the case where you *can't* successfully defend (or don't want to risk the shadow).  Worth deck space?  Certainly not going to be a staple, as Feint is for tactics.  It's a pity that it isn't 0 cost, since having to exhaust a defender and return the non-attacking enemy to staging are already substantial costs, especially the latter.

 

However, it is useful if you have some reason to want the enemy back in staging, such as a traps deck with an open trap, or enabling Dunhere, or simply because the enemy engaged with the wrong deck.

 

The noble exhaustion cost is going to best met by a non-attacker who doesn't quest and can't defend without dying, which can describe just about any noble defender that's sufficiently banged up, but otherwise isn't a large set.  The noble allies are expensive and generally don't fit that description, though a 1 wp Denethor or a Faramir not needed in the quest phase might.  Eldahir is the only noble primary defender, and with sentinel could use the card to unengage an enemy from other decks as well.

 

Another situation where it might come in handy is in combination with Armored Destrier in a quest with nasty shadow effects.  Exhaust to defend, return enemy #1 to staging to avoid his attack, and the destrier discards the shadow for enemy #2 and readies the noble for a shadow-free defense.  This might be particularly useful for Wastes of Eriador, where at night you can't cancel shadows and the enemies are going to return to staging anyway.

 

Other quests that this might help are with non-immune bosses that attack from staging, since the card won't make them immune from counterattack.  Against the balrog in Shadow & Flame, it really is a second-class feint.  So overall a situational card.

 

The same is true of the expensive Vigilant Guard.  Great for TaGimli since it doesn't take a restricted spot and powers him up, great for TaBoromir ally's readying or for silvan warriors or Derndingle Warriors who can benefit from automatic healing from other allies, but otherwise this isn't going to push Honour Guard out of any decks.

Doesn't the fact that Terrible to Behold cancels the attack mean that Armored Destrier doesn't meet its trigger condition ("After attached hero defends against an attack...")?

One thing nice about Terrible to Behold is that it works against unexpected attacks in the Quest phase where Feint does diddly squat.

You're right about Feint not working, but I'm not sure Terrible does either.

 

"If a card effect uses the word "then," then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve."

 

So if we can't return the enemy to the staging area (because he isn't engaged) can we use the card?

I was mainly referring to something like http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Followed-by-Night-RtR [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Followed-by-Night-RtR] where enemies could already be engaged with you and making attacks.

 

I'm not sure if it works against enemies that are are attacking from the staging area, but I would bet no.

> Just makes me want City of the Corsairs more and, inexplicably, Outlands Imrahil.

yeah, i'm glad to see new Outlands support is making people give Outlands another chance.

 

i think when people cried 'it makes the game too easy!' before what they really meant was that it made deckbuilding easy (or rather, that it didn't give a lot of interesting choices and/or streamlined the process by including pretty much all Outlands cards and then deciding if you really wanted Hunter of Lamedon or not)

but this new Imrahil hero and Imrahil attachment are nice.  Tactics or Leadership Imrahil?  if Tactics, what are you going to add?  or maybe even go Spirit with the new Imrahil ally...  it opened up a lot of the deckbuilding space i think, which makes it a bit more engaging.

Both of these cards feel a little too expensive to me. Terrible to Behold might see play in my LeDenethor + Damrod Palantir/Trap deck, but other than that I'm not sure I'll use it very often.

 

It'd be fun to build a deck around getting down Ally Boromir + Raiment of War + Vigilant Guard. That's 9 resources and and a 3-card combo though, and those really aren't things that Tactics can do on its own.

## 25 [PsychoRocka on September 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230535-the-corsairs-of-umbar/?do=findComment&comment=2423583)

Removed my long boring rant, here are some new uses I thought of for the two spoiled player cards instead.

Vigilant Guard can be used on offensive heroes/characters with high hitpoints so that they always take the 1st point of damage dealt to your defensive characters. This helps protect against unforeseen deaths from nasty shadow effects boosting enemy attack. It also helps provide protection for allies with 1 hitpoint especially against nasty treachery effects that damage multiple characters. These allies can now be saved from these effects and that single point of damage.

Terrible to Behold is great with trap decks forcing a nasty enemy back into the staging area and straight into a trap like ranger spikes, ithilien pit etc. You can stop an especially nasty enemy from attacking then place it back into the staging area so you can destroy it next turn using Ride them Down. I still think that Terrible to Behold is best used in tandem with Tactigorn or a deck that focuses on staging area attack.

Yeah, I think Prince will be better on Leadership Imrahil, or at least easier and less janky.

All of these references to the Grey Company in the article make me hopeful for Elladan + Elrohir allies.

i think Vigilant Guard is basically reads: 'attach to Tactics Gimli'

it's really nice for him to help build up his power in a less risky way. it could be too expensive, as you say, but it does also provide 2 extra hit points, so for Gimli: it's a 3-cost, +2 attack card that also helps you build up his attack in a more controlled way

i can't think of anything else that would be super helpful otherwise. spreading the damage around in a way to prevent characters from dying, but i agree. it's really expensive in that regard.

also about Terrible to Behold: it's a Tactics effect in Leadership. it's not going to be as good. look at Quick Ears [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Quick-Ears-TBoCD] or Expert Trackers [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Expert-Trackers-TLR], which are not normally Lore abilities, but not as good as their counterparts.

it gives more options for a Leadership/Tactics deck, but i think this fits into a Leadership deck that doesn't have access to Feint. it also helps Dunhere, if such a Rohan deck could be made (Rohan has quite a few options with Leadership, and there are plenty of nobles, so i could see this working there). and it's cheaper than A Light in the Dark*

*if you don't need your noble's action for anything else

yeah, i've been rocking a Hirluin, Denethor, Hirluin mono Leadership, and i think i'll end up replacing Denethor with Leadership Imrahil

i also tried Erestor, based on someone's posted deck, and that extra card draw is pretty awesome. it might make Tactics Imrahil worth considering, but Lord of Morthond is just so awesome!

Denethor is another good one too. But I like the lineup I mentioned, feels very thematic but not in a forced way. Sure, you could exploit Faramir better in another deck, but with how huge the Outlanders get, just readying an ally whenever you engage an enemy is pretty good. And of course, with Imrahil you get another Outlands hero, which gives a great new spin to the deck. Maybe you won't be using his ability that often because you don't want your allies to die, but with like x3 Sneak Attack, x3 Gandalf and x3 Tome of Atanatar, you're gonna use it for sure. I think an actually more refreshing, thematic Outlands deck is going to emerge after the last pack is released.

But if the enemy is engaged with you then Feint does work.

Ok, while Nyashish isn't spoiled yet, I'll make a little gamble for myself.

 

When Nyashish is spoiled, if I like her ability and consider it viable, I instantly order all the stuff I'm currently missing from my LotR collection, which includes most Nightmare packs, some PoD quests, and all currently available Grey Havens APs.

its a combat action though so you can't use it during staging.

It is probably alot better on Gimli as it gives him extra hitpoints without taking up a restricted slot like Citadel Plate. This way you can put other useful attachments on him instead. Its still pretty great on Gloin as well though. Outside these two heroes the only other decent use I can think of is Boromir ally who already costs 4 on his own (so it would cost 7 to get this attached to him which is a quite a lot especially for tactics...). A little bit too niche for my liking. I guess one other thing you could do with it is attach it to a warrior character with a decent amount of hitpoints so that they can take the first point of damage dealt to your main defender a few times to keep damage off your defender. You are still going to need to heal your character with Vigilant Guard eventually (in harder quests at least) so you are just buying yourself time in a way. I really like the concept and design of the card but again I think 3 cost is just too much and the difference between 2 and 3 cost is HUGE in this game especially considering many decks feature 1 hero in one sphere and the other 2 in a second so the main difference between 2 and 3 cost is whether you can play it with a single turns worth of resources or if you have to use resource ramp/wait multiple turns before you can play the card. Even though I don't run tactics Gimli or Gloin I would still be considering including this card in my current decks with Tactics Aragorn or Leadership Gimli as the intended targets if it cost 2, 3 is just too high a cost however and so until I one day build a deck around Gloin or tactics Gimli this card will remain unused.

Outside these two heroes the only other decent use I can think of is Boromir ally who already costs 4 on his own (so it would cost 7 to get this attached to him which is a quite a lot especially for tactics...). A little bit too niche for my liking. I guess one other thing you could do with it is attach it to a warrior character with a decent amount of hitpoints so that they can take the first point of damage dealt to your main defender a few times to keep damage off your defender. You are still going to need to heal your character with Vigilant Guard eventually (in harder quests at least) so you are just buying yourself time in a way. I really like the concept and design of the card but again I think 3 cost is just too much and the difference between 2 and 3 cost is HUGE in this game especially considering many decks feature 1 hero in one sphere and the other 2 in a second so the main difference between 2 and 3 cost is whether you can play it with a single turns worth of resources or if you have to use resource ramp/wait multiple turns before you can play the card. Even though I don't run tactics Gimli or Gloin I would still be considering including this card in my current decks with Tactics Aragorn or Leadership Gimli as the intended targets if it cost 2, 3 is just too high a cost however and so until I one day build a deck around Gloin or tactics Gimli this card will remain unused.

I'm afraid we can't -- which takes away its ability to be used against engaged-from-staging-areas.  This card is getting more niche by the minute.

> also about Terrible to Behold: it's a Tactics effect in Leadership. it's not going to be as good. look at Quick Ears [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Quick-Ears-TBoCD] or Expert Trackers [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Expert-Trackers-TLR], which are not normally Lore abilities, but not as good as their counterparts.
> 
> it gives more options for a Leadership/Tactics deck, but i think this fits into a Leadership deck that doesn't have access to Feint. it also helps Dunhere, if such a Rohan deck could be made (Rohan has quite a few options with Leadership, and there are plenty of nobles, so i could see this working there). and it's cheaper than A Light in the Dark*
> 
> *if you don't need your noble's action for anything else.

I've no problem with Terrible to Behold not being as good as Feint.  I'm just surprised that it's so much worse than feint.  There are plenty of nobles, but there are few nobles who you won't need their action for anything else, when in combat.  But I think it's the return to staging that's the killer.  If that wasn't there, or avoidable by playing another cost (a resource?), it'd be more generally useful.

 

You're right that it is comparable in effect to A Light in the Dark -- and no one really considers that card a "spirit Feint" even though it has the same virtues as this card.  At ringsdb of 765 of 1145 tactics decks use Feint (67%), while 49 of 1495 spirit decks use A Light in the Dark (3%), and as you might expect, most of those are either Dunhere decks or limited card pool.  I will grant that A Light in the Dark would be more useful in spirit if it were 1 resource and a noble exhaustion.

 

So instead of an inferior feint, we get a superior Light in the Dark....

 I feel like there are shenanigans to be pulled with Terrible to Behold.  And how good it is sort of depends on who you are using it on.

Take for example Arwen Undomiel (ally), suppose Galadriel is on your team you can put her on the quest without exhausting, engage an enemy and defend with Arwen, Terrible to Behold, and trigger Arwen's ability on another character.  

Hilarious as it is, I think that Arwen Undomiel is probably the  best target for this card.   You don't want to exhaust a hero of course,  but maybe you don't have to.  

In-sphere you could use Terrible to Behold on Ally Faramir, for those situations where you don't really need his ability because you are overquesting anyway, you can make an easy defense.  

You might also be interested in running this card in a Dunhere deck, where I think it could be really strong.

## 42 [monkeyrama on September 21, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230535-the-corsairs-of-umbar/?do=findComment&comment=2424256)

The Glorfindel ally is potentially a target for Terrible to Behold. He can ready again by discarding.

 

I'm not totally sold on the card, but it will have its place. Pushing enemies back into the staging area can be handy for some deck types that would be willing to sacrifice one action to get an enemy away. And in multiplayer it may help to reorganise enemies if they swamped too much at one point and the dedicated combat deck didn't get them all? Although there are other solutions to this problem (ranged etc.). Hmm.

Maybe it was mentioned, but it works with Bard and Great Yew Bow too. But that archetype I think needs more stuff to throw enemies into the staging area, and Bard is pretty high threat so that hurts the strategy. I'm not sure about this card yet.

No. Shipping stuff separately to where I live is costy, so I usually wait until the whole cycle releases and then order everything at once. Good thing I have waited long enough for Grey Havens Deluxe to release before I ordered last time, so I can play with Nyashish.

the whole reason i brought it up initially and why i'm making an effort now is because more than one person has quoted you and spelled Na'asiyah's name as you do.

if everyone knew that you simply can't be bothered to learn her name and are using an incorrect spelling, that would be one thing, but some people have seen your posts and incorrectly assumed that it was correct.

Terrible To Behold doesn't seem very good, but I can see its worth in quests that like to spring powerful high engagement cost enemies on you without your consent. We also from time to time play with pairs of decks where one deck has no interest in ever fighting an enemy, so it can slot in there too.

## 55 [monkeyrama on September 22, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230535-the-corsairs-of-umbar/?do=findComment&comment=2425399)

I can also see a use for the card in trap decks when a boss enemy auto-engages but is not immune to attachments. You could (potentially) push the boss back into the staging area to get trapped and then re-engage a weaker boss. Captain Sahir, for example, would not get to attack (so no new resource tokens) and would also get a trap.

 

My one big complaint so far about this cycle (otherwise excellent) is that I'm currently running a trap deck with a Noldor deck. But any time I get to a sailing quest I basically can't use the trap deck (ships immune, enemies engage via boarding). I know that I could build a different deck, but I'm sad that trap decks keep hitting quests that ignore them. Sad. But this card gives another way to mess around even with those situations, and select the enemy who is trapped.

## 56 [monkeyrama on September 22, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230535-the-corsairs-of-umbar/?do=findComment&comment=2425406)

And, I should add, this makes it functionally different from Feint (ie it is also about messing with the enemies on another level other than stopping an attack). In these respects, and that giving Leadership a direct equivalent to Feint would be bad, I'm coming around to this card. Eleanor could not serve a dual purpose.

I meant that any person who might get confused by the way I call her will be instantly cured as soon as he sees any Nyashish card, regardless where it comes from. (Because people who will get confused probably didn't see her yet.)

and with the Asmodee merge, it's a lot harder to find it available online.

the only things i can really check are CoolStuffInc (which has really high international shipping costs), or Team Covenant, which has decent shipping, but the subscription charges 6 packs worth of shipping up front (granted, you don't have to pay shipping for a while, but you're locked into the subscription for 6 packs). you could theoretically just order from the store though, which i may start doing.

There's also a unique spirit ally called Sulien.

As there are 3 Tactics cards in A Storm on Cobas Haven, I'd say we lacks spoilers for:

 

- 1 spirit card

- 1 tactics cards

- 1 leadership card

- 2 lore card

 

1 or 2 of them are Gondor allies depending on Sulien's trait. Sulien does not look like she's Gondor, I think she's Dunedain but her trait is unrevealed at the moment.

 

Here's hoping for: another non-unique Ithilien Ranger actually doing something related to traps, Sulien finally being Gondor and doing something related to Caldara's archetype (some sort of discarding ability would be nice) and a low-cost non-unique Tactics Rohan ally just so I can build a mono-tactics Rohan with enough thematic allies.

My bad I must have just assumed they were Spanish because of how big the Spanish community is and we usually get some neat spoilers from them.

Well, what I meant is the spirit girl card has her trait box partially exposed on Seastan's picture, while it is fully concealed on mine, so I was joking, pretending to think that Seastan can magically pull cards out on pictures to make their text readable.

Ah right, didn't notice the difference in the two pictures!

Also just realised the picture John posted IS in Spanish so I probably looked at that one first and didn't even notice the picture Seastan posted wasn't in Spanish and was in fact French. At least I know why I made that mistake now!
