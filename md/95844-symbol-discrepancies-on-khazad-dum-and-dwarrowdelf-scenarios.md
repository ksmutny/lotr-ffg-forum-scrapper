# [Symbol discrepancies on Khazad-dum and Dwarrowdelf scenarios](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95844-symbol-discrepancies-on-khazad-dum-and-dwarrowdelf-scenarios/)

Hello,

 

For the Into the Pit scenario, it says to use the Twists and Turns and Hazards of the Pit encounter cards (among others) and shows the torch and the cracked stone symbols.

 

For Flight from Moria it says to use the Hazards of the Pit and the Deeps of Moria and shows the chain and the cracked stone.

 

For The Long Dark it says to use Twists and Turns and Hazards of the Pit and shows the torch and the chain.

 

For Foundations of Stone it says to use Twists and Turns and Deeps of Moria and shows the torch and the cracked stone.

 

For Shadow and Flame it says to use Deeps of Moria and shows the chain.

 

Obviously there are some typos but I do not know which ones are incorrect.  I checked the online versions on FFG's support page and they have not been changed.

 

Which encounter card symbols match up to which names?

 

Which ones encounter cards should I use for the scenarios -- the ones named or the ones symbolized?

 

Thanks for the help,

 

Thomas

 

Edit:  Spelling.

Deeps of Moria is the chain.

Twists and Turns is the torch.

Hazards of the Pit is the cracked stone.

 

I remember reading a correction somewhere, but can't remember where it was... the quest cards are all printed correctly, with correct encounter set icons, so follow those.  The rule inserts give the wrong set names, so just ignore the text and follow the icons.
