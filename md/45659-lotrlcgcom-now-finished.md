 I just finished updated the images (thanks to Darksbane from cardgamedb.com) so now LotRLCG.com [http://lotrlcg.com] is finished. It is a a database that is searchable and sortable and has a scenario builder [http://lotrlcg.com/searchBox.php?terms=&Type=1&Sphere=1&Expsn=1&Sort=1&Sort_AD=1&Then_Sort=1&Then_Sort_AD=1&radio=All&Scenario=2&Encounter_Set=1]. I will soon have a scoring calculator, keyword glossary, and an errata/official FAQ reference as well.

If you find any errors or have any suggestions, please email me at lotrlcg[at]gmail.com.

I am considering adding German, French, and Italian versions, so if you would like have this tool avaible in your language, please contact me because I am looking for volunteers.

 Thanks a lot for the effort! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Anyway, I'm takin' a look at it to find mistakes (not doing this "against" the project, obviously :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]) and I found one: the PICTURE of BERAVOR (Core, n.12) is a wrong one (It has the picture of two different quest cards). :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'll let you know if I find something else. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

It'd be handy if there was an option to get search results without the spoilers, so you can just see the names of all the cards on a single page.

Very useful and well done!  Any plans to allow for deck building, saving and sharing deck lists?

Done. Just hit the List Results checkbox.

Saving and building decks is beyond the scope of what I want to do at this time. Darksbane's site, cardgamedb.com, is already set up for that. 

Thanks everyone for letting me know of any errors or typos.

Site looks great Mason, only thing I see that is strange is when you search the filter box at the top the position of everything seems to change, not sure if this is by design or not but it confused me for a second.

And as Mason was kind enough to point out if you are looking to build decks, save and share them check out my LotR deckbuilder [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-deckbuilder].

just found a little typing error: Response: After Miner of the Iron Hills enters play, shoose and discard 1 Condition attachment from play.

Great work on both sites, Mason and Darksbane respectively. Very good places to have around especially when bored at work.;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 I believe I found a typo on A Burning Brand.  I think it should say Attach to a character, not Attack to a character.

Great work, thanks for your effort mason240

Longbeard Map-Maker is misspelled Longbeard Mad-Maker in the card title :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I don't know if it's bug, but it bugs me :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

When I wanted to search for the Carrock cards I chose as filter the expansions drop down menu and chose Confl. at. t Carrock. -> "Your search returned 0 results."

The same for HFG. The only expansions filter that works is the general shadows of mirkwood-filter. I think because you assigned all the expansion cards to the general cycle and not to the single packs.

Is it a bug?

Thanks for this, very helpful.

Just one minor query- if you search by expansion: i.e. Hunt for Gollum, Conflict at the Carrock, nothing appears - all those cards are just listed under 'shadows of Mirkwood' - is there any way to search by individual chapter pack, rather than the whole cycle?

## 14 [lleimmoen on August 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45659-lotrlcgcom-now-finished/?do=findComment&comment=509261)

Excellent site. Many thanks for sharing.

Little misspelled card "Grimbeorn the old" is written "Gimbeorn the old".

 

Great site !

I don't know about any of the other languages but myself and my wife would like to help translate the cards into Chinese if that is at all possible.

 

We love the game and would like to keep it as international as possible.

I found a typo, I think.

Roasted Slowly
[Treachery]

When Revealed: Destroy all heroes with the card "Sacked" attached. Then, shuffle Roasted Slowly back into the encounter deck.
Shadow: If attacking enemy is a Troll, remove 2 damage tokens from it.

49

[shadows of Mirkwood]

x4 <- in my copy of CatC were only 2 copies of that card.

 

But I had 3 versions of A Frightened Beast (where lotrlcg.com lists only one copy)

 @Doom1502

I had 3 copies of A Frightened Beast and 2 copies of Roasted Slowly as well, I assume that's the norm.

 I can confirm that I got what Lightdarker did.
