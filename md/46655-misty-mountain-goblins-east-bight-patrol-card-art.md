Hi guys,

this is my first post here, I am one of the artists working on those gorgeous cards. I really enjoyed this project, so here are two cards in bigger resolutions that I did some time ago. I hope that you will enjoy them as much as I creating them.

Fantastic Nick,  Would look at buying your work if it was available as a full print.  i know one of the others around here does it.

Love it!  2 great pictures

Thank You very much Carnivean.
I am glad that you like them. I hope that you enjoy the game ;}.

About the prints - I will have to check this, but I am almost certain that we are not allowed to sell prints for the Lord of the Rings franchise.

Welcome to the forum, and thanks for sharing!

I always enjoy seeing card art in higher resolution and these are some very atmospheric, great-looking pieces.

I'm looking forward to see more of your work!

Allow me to also add my congratulations to you and all the other artists who have worked on this game.  I am sure that everyone would agree that great art work really enhances the appeal and feel of a game.  A lot of the time your efforts and talents go amiss, but be assured that there are thousands of people out there who appreciate your work.  The standard of gameing art is rising all the time - good old healthy competition I suspect - so keep up the good work and good luck.  Cheers!

Thank You for the nice words guys, you are very kind!

@Rashley - you are totally right, and I want also to congratulate the other artists, I may don`t know most of them but I have seen some amazing art in the net.

East Bight Patrol is utterly fantastic, they're the most scary enemy in the core set for me.

Both cards art is fantastic. And both pics make good wallpaper for my laptop desktop.

Beautiful work. Many thanks for sharing with us on the forums. The use of original artwork in this game has me poring over each card in great detail - adding lots of enjoyment and anticipation for new cards.

Congratulations and Best Regards.

Well met, collegue! Great to see another artist on the forumshappy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Great job on these pieces, It would be a shame to see them card-size only.

@ ClydeCloggie, ChinaBlade -> thanks a lot, you guys are all so kind in this forum.

@ Toqtamish - I am currently beginning to work on my site, and you gave me a nice Idea and a I can make a few wallpapers from some of the cards I`ve made (as long as the NDA is lifted)

@ Tiziano - Hi and really nice to "meet you", I am keeping track of almot all your recent work (at least what you upload on deviantart.com) from a long time :}. Just wanted to say to you - you have some amazing cards with very strong feeling in it and keep up the good work!!!

Best,
Nick
