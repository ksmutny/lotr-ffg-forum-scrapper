For those sane people who are not moronic sheep, that refuse to use that ******* security hole, civil rights disaster called Facebook...

Hmm... these are pretty cool I guess... they seam a little weak.

 

The Condition attachment is a good idea, but so easy to play around that this shouldn't ever worry you. In fact I would be inclined to let this resolve then remove it with a dwarf and save the when reveal cancels for more important stuff. I guess it will depend if the clock is sped up in this new version.

 

Rob and Bob is a nice card. First seen in the Custom Quest 2 Heads are Better than One, it is a nearly word for word copy. Solo player it is just a normal guy, and two player it is just a normal 2 guys.. yet more easy to control as a single optional engage can control it.

 

Dark Pools is a cool card, I like this one and its effect, but again... easy to play around. The wording is a little weak, so if you deck build for a very even amount of cost cards I think you get to choose witch ally.. not that it will not resolve. So in most cases you just kill your worst guy. Aim for a 2 cost build... with the occasional 3 drop... shouldn't be a problem.

 

Goblin Eagle Hunter is by far the coolest card spoiled.  Nasty effect not requiring to be in staging area or anything so no way to turn off, even with snares and wot not.. you have to kill it. Has a great scaler mechanism so is harder with more players and will cause real problems if drawn early. Great Stuff!

 

Was expecting a lot more.. I hope there are some more power cards to come. I was hoping for NM version of the carrock trolls for example and I would have liked to see some more scary ass locations!

 

NM is so awesome.. can not wait to play this.

i received my new nightmare decks today and can confirm....

 

there are new versions of the unique trolls. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

each nightmare deck is 20 cards, with about 5-9 new unique cards (of course, some of which have multiple copies). always a safe bet to reserve judgement til you've seen them all. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

You lucky to get second Nighmtare set. I have a first one but even dont have idea when i can get  a second. My supplier even didn get Amon Din yet.

 

Yes NM is the best additional in the gsme now. Make a game so much better. SInce is not only harder but much more interesting too.

 

Hey we need some NM videos now with CBOTR. Please, please. Im vote for HFG. I believe this one is the best amony them.

Thanks for the offer, Glaurung, but we already have the first set of nightmare cards ready to go for as soon as we wrap up our first three "Against the Shadow" adventure packs.

No rush or anything.  I know the progression series is not your top priority, and that's fine.  But to do player card reviews and and all 3 quests in the Against the Shadow cycle, it will probably be about a month before you do the nightmare packs.(Assuming your keeping about on your somewhat normal schedule) 

 

So can we have just a few more spoilers not about cards but about how quest is and how much harder it really makes them and stuff????   :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]

They are cool. But most cool and hard is Dol-Guldor. I have 2 decks which ones can win. there is a video about those decks in my youtube channel. Will be cool if you build up another 2 cool decks to win this one.

So in CatC you first kill 4 trolls assuming you don´t face any other non-unique troll and then you face a two-headed troll which brings 1 more troll per player? Sweet.
