 OK,  the event that was scheduled was cancelled.  What was going to happen was not revealed.  The resources that were to be used did not arrive.  At least that was the impression that I got.  Instead, Caleb Grace had a Q&A with the eight or nine players that showed up.

Each of us did receive a playmat and deck box with LOTR LCG theme.  That was cool.

I got the feeling, and have no proof at all, that HON is due out very soon.

I will fill you in on our discussion with Caleb this week when I can use a key board rather my phone.

 That is sad to hear….

 

I was with great expectations about this new "encounter cards"

I hope FFG publishes the "thing" as print on demand.

This is not the news I was looking for…

Very very bad……… Yes lets hope for print on Demand…….

Shame it didn't go to plan, maybe it's too ambitious with all the things round the corner.


I would love to get a playmat and deck box though…

 Any chance of pictures of the playmat and deckbox?

I am really quite saddened by this. The idea of extra cards to mix in with existing quests was just too exciting! I hope they get a "real" release though, and not limited to just POD - I'd prefer my cards to feel right within the deck.

Yes!! We want to see the playmat and the deckbox!

You can also see the card boxes and playmat if you friend Cardboard of the Rings on Facebook. They both have the box art from Khazad Dum and look really sweet!

## 15 [richsabre on November 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74111-report-from-roseville/?do=findComment&comment=723240)

looks nice but has anyone got specs for the mat? comparing to the deck boxes it looks rather small

rich

PS- are these going on sale?

## 16 [ins3kT on November 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74111-report-from-roseville/?do=findComment&comment=723378)

A pity the event was cancelled. I wonder whether it was because of the low attendance or other reasons.

I was really looking forward to this!

## 17 [Keggy on November 14, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74111-report-from-roseville/?do=findComment&comment=723456)

Basically all of Sunday was cancelled.  the kept the hall open for people to play with friends, but both the LOTR event and SW learning tournament were cancelled.

Rather strange…hope it is not ominous of anything too bad…

So this [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3792] is what it was all about then…exciting times!

But, as I said on BGG, did we really need a "Nightmare Mode" for Escape from Dol Guldur?

For solo players, probably not,

 

but Dol Guldur isn't challenging at all when you have 2 or more players. So for multiplayers it could be a welcome.

agree. I never lost with 2 players and with 3 players is too easy. Now sounds much more interesting.

Yes, for multi-player games, anyway. I agree with the others. Solo is ridiculous, I know, but 2/3/4 player I can't remember the last time we lost on any of the core set quests, including Dol Guldur.

## 24 [player2052423 on December 12, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74111-report-from-roseville/?do=findComment&comment=733139)

Yeah, this is what we were going to play in Minneapolis (Roseville).  My guess is that the cards did not arrive on time from the printers to have the event and thus it was cancelled.

I'm looking forward to seeing what they have in store for us with these new encounter cards before I pass judgement.  My only beef is that they will not be readily available to everyone until they are available POD.
