I was wondering if anyone else has received a miscut Conflict at the Garrock? My cards have their top part cut-off and the bottom of the card is the top of another card. I've sent a message to support to see if they can send me a replacement. I'm not sure I want to give them, they are rather unique and a cool item to a collection.

This is the first time I've heard of this happening, but if it happened to your deck there may be others out there.

 It would be interesting to find the matching set. I'd like to own the top and bottom parts of these cards.
