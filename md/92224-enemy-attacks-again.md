there is a card in black riders that confuses me. most of the time shadow cards that say 'enemy attacks again' have deal it another shadow card afterwards

 

this one does not. does an enemy always get a shadow card if instructed to attack again after its current attack

 

i would say no, as shadow cards have already been given before this stage, and what why would some cards say yes and others not?

thanks

I think yes, you must deal other shadow card

 

(1.42) Additional attacks by an enemy
When an enemy makes an additional attack, discard all
of its previously dealt shadow cards before dealing it a
new shadow card.

 

But you say is true. There are cards that say "add other one more shadow card" and cards that not. I think it is a bug, but corrected by faq1.5 num1.42. Only if the shadow card say "other attack without shadow card" then no deal next shadow card.
