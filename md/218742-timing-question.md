If Dain defends against an enemy and shadow card is snowstorm, does Dain get killed immidietly or can i use miruvor to avoid Dain's death? I hope i wasn't too unclear.

Looks like you got one frozen Dain right there.

Yeah, you have resolve the shadow effect immediately once it is flipped, before you are able to take an action such as discarding Miruvor.

However, if you somehow scry the shadow card, or if you're just scared of that shadow effect, you do have the option of discarding Miruvor after declaring Dain as the defender but before flipping the shadow card. On the other hand, if the shadow was then something else it might be a bit of a waste of the Miruvor.
