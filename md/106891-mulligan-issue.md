I have witnessed a friendly game. At start, both players draw their hand. I noticed

that one player decided to use the mulligan ruling. Whoa! Wait a minute here...

This player only discarded 3 cards and drew 3 new cards.  No way!  Did he just

pull a fast one.. with the other player not catching it...? :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]

 

Ok, I didn't say anything for I didn't know the clarity of the mulligan rule. :huh: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_huh.png]

 

(*) My gaming instincts tell me... if I do a mulligan on my first draw of the cards for

my hand... I am to discard the full hand. Not a selected few! (*) :blink: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_blink.png]

 

Well... hmm... now, what if both players agreed amongst themselves already

that it can be for certain amount of cards and not just the whole hand?

 

Then again... if it's a "regulation / tournament" game... I must go with my original

gaming instinct (*) .

Your friend is a totally cheater. Lol. The mulligan is about entire hand.

Well... you can always make your own house rules, I guess. But yes, I think a mulligan is meant to apply to the entire hand.

that the dude ripped his opponent !  Bummer.... Hate dishonesty !!!
