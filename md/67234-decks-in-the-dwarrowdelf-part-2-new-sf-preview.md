Agreed. The comparison with Ring Mail is amusing.

But I wouldn't find this too strong, just handy. I mean for Dain, for instance, the difference between 5 or 6 hps is not that great; Gloin is a different matter though.

i like all the power increase cards for dwarves- i mean with dain you have +1 willpower and defense this card +1 hitpoint, other cards give willpower increase- its now incredibly easy to throw together a dwarf deck with a lot of alllies and the right combos and have a winning deck for just about any scenario

Love this card, though I would say that Ringmail is very good in its own way.

Yeah, actually the biggest difference may be between 1 and 2 hps, so this is a great safety cushion for the likes of Zigil Miner or Erebor Record Keeper.

 In the strategy notes about the sample decks, the article states that the tactics & spirit player can help the other by playing ever my heart rises on his characters. Now, correct me if im wrong, but wouldnt that still reduce the tactics & spirit players threat, not the other players?

They keep fueling up already competent dwarf sphere. I hope they will start do the same with others soon. Rohan, for example, has this useless attachment  with cost of 1 which adds a Rohan trait, while there is from low to zero sense being a Rohan in dis game ages after it's release.

No, it would reduce the other player's threat.

When you play an attachment on another player's character, that player gains control of the attachment (see p.25 of the rules). So, if you play Ever My Heart Rises on another player's character, that other player is able to trigger the attachment's effect.

there are some readying card effects that trigger on rohan trait characters

Thanks, i'd missed that in the rules.

That's why I said "from low to zero" and not just "zero". Theres also effect which causes Rohan characters to not exhaust when commiting for a quest for one turn. But cost for this is just tremendous, no wonder no one uses these.

Yes, for the amount of cards that Rohan has been given, the synergies are almost non-existent (at least in comparison to Dwarves). Rohan Heroes and Allies are good to great but they work well on their own, they're not really supported by a common trait; maybe with the exception of Astonishing Speed.

I am not entirely sold on this card yet. A +1 HP increase across the board seems powerful, but I am not sure how big of an advantage it gives you over the encounter deck. Is it good for the 1 HP Dwarf allies? Yes. But there are other Dwarf cards that cost the same or less that are better.

I mean, it's only good if you play a dwarf deck. This seems like a really cool thematic card between dwarves and Gandalf.  I really must say that it doesn't bother me. The card is only good in one type of deck.

To trigger the effect of "Heavy Stroke", does the dwarf have to attack alone? Otherwise I don't see how to calculate the additional threat.

## 18 [MyNeighbourTrololo on July 10, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67234-decks-in-the-dwarrowdelf-part-2-new-sf-preview/?do=findComment&comment=656132)

I see it as attack, in which Dwarf character participated.

I believe this is the first time I've seen deck building for coop - two decks.

This I find awesome. More of this FFG!

You can see much of that around the net. I bet players here will supply you with decks of their own (me included) if you wish. And again I am hiding this post from ffg but I am not overally impressed by the decks, especially the inclusion of Zigil Miner with no combos, I know they wanted to go all Dwarves but then they have got a card like Lore of Imladris, I know it doesn't have any trait but one knowing the story knows it has little to do with the Dwarves. And having one or two Noldor characters to help the Dwarves out is pretty thematic anyways.

I see that Hardy Leadership doesn't have a type (condition, item,…). I hope FFG don't forget this.

Totally read the card first as all dwarves get +1 willpower sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif] . Found it odd it didn't create a bigger outcry, then read the actual card again. Oh, +1 hitpoint!

That's a good point.  Maybe a dwarf just has to patricipate in the attack?  Otherwise, it would be, "I used Legolas' 3 attack to get throught the troll's armor, and Gimli's 5 attack to incur damage."  I doubt that's the way the mechanic was intended to be used.  happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Sorry for the double-post, but just wanted to say I was responding to leptokurt above. (forgot to quote)
