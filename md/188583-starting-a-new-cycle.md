When starting up a new cycle, should I take out the cards in the player deck that where acquired throughout  the playing of a previous cycle or do we keep them and keep adding to the player decks?

You're free to use any player cards you like to build decks.  The only exceptions are cards that are earned as scenario rewards (Boon and Treasure cards in the Saga expansions).
