 I just noticed they moved it from July 20th to July 22nd and have pushed back the other Adventure Packs accordingly (Conflict at the Carrock: Sept 1; Journey to Rhosgobel Sept 22; Hill of Emyn Muil October 24th). 

Any idea how valid these are?

 It's very difficult to say considering how unreliable Amazon is for both having gaming products on the release date and for guessing about release dates in general.

 yeah, that's what i figured. i just found in interesting that they moved the backs back, with now two in one month. 

i just hope it's sooner rather than later!

I just preordered it anyway.  I suppose I'll get it when I get it.  Hopefully, it will be released sooner rather than later.

If it helps anyone this is the official response from a distributor that I got:

Almost all of Fantasy Flight's products are running late right now. We were originally told that the Hunt For Gollum pack would arrive in May. When it didn't arrive then, we expected it in June. However, we now don't expect it until sometime in July (Fantasy Flight has not announced a specific release date). Conflict at Carrock probably won't arrive now until late July or even August now.

So it doesn't look good for us, I want the new quest and cards asap!

I can cope with delays but it is irritating when a company doesn't bother to keep their customers informed. Even a "sorry guys, we're running late - be with you soon" would be good to hear. Doesn't take much effort does it?

Received my Hunt for Gollum pack last week through Maelstrom...no idea how they got it.

On BGG one of the game companies related that their shipments from China had been held up by widespread flooding. I highly suspect this also happened to FFGs printed materials

 

But yes you are right, reaching out to the customer, and other interested parties, is a core project duty.  In most companies I have worked with this would be a sackable offense for the ill will such silence generates.

Regardless of FFG's silence on the delays, the fact that we know it's EN ROUTE is light years ahead of UDE's customer service.

Mestrahd is 10000000% correct.

 

In other news, I contacted Fantasy Flight Directly, asking them when it will be released, or at least when we will know. We'll see if they respond...

## 11 [Klaen on July 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49448-hunt-for-gollum-release-date-amazoncom/?do=findComment&comment=496208)

From what I have seen they are pretty quick with their updates in the 'upcoming' section of the site.

At present it looks like Gollukm is still on a boat...So I am guessing we are talking several weeks still (which would roughly place it around 20ish of July).

Those of you in the states should have a heart for 'outliers' like myself in Australia...as I am sure I'll be waiting a couple more weeks beyond when I get yours (counting for shipping n' stuff).

Oh well...back to more ME Quest miniature painting...lol

In case anyone's interested, here is the response I got from FFG:

-----------------------------------------

The game is on the boat and expected in the next few weeks. You can 
see our release schedule here;
http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_upcoming.asp [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_upcoming.asp]

Despite saying 'Spring of 2011' it was put on the boat June 2nd, and
that puts it right at the end of the expected 4-6 weeks transit time.

Thanks for playing,
Thaadd Powell

I guess that's a little bit more information than we had before?

I feel like we're playing The Hunt for The Hunt for Gollum.

The response you got reminds us that while it may feel like it's "late" it's really not. Our emotions are playing tricks on us. Let us try to maintain patience fellow hunters!

No. it's definitely late.  But, whatever. Thadd is a customer service maniac. He took care of my issue with a quickness when my Middle Earth Quest was all defective!

What I was trying to say was:

When they give you information such as: 'On Boat' 6/2/2011 and "It takes around 4-6 weeks to get to our warehouse", you can do the math to figure out, "Ok, July 14th is the latest it should take to get to 'shipping out to stores'." If it's later than that you can start complaining that "it's late!" or "they're not telling us when it's coming!" Until then, it just seems juvenile to complain.

I totally agree though that the original estimates were late may and it's been pushed back which is unfortunate but not something to blame FFG for because they've given us enough information as to when to expect the game.

When I noticed that the new LotR article on the main page today included the words "IN STOCK," I wanted it so badly to be news about Hunt for Gollum. sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]  Ah well though, I'm glad it's selling so well.

I was actually able to grab a hunt for Gollum pack a couple of weeks ago at a local store.  I am not sure how they got it, I think they said something about receiving a few copies for promotional release.  Just to give people an idea the quest is a 4 difficulty.  it utilizies objective cards and isn't too difficult but is very fun!  Also, just to let people know about cards in the set that are good: song of kings.  costs 1 resource, colourless attachment: give attached character the leadership colour.  Strider's Path.  lore costs 1 resource.  Response: place a location that was just revealed from the top of the quest deck as the travel location without triggering the effect.  If there is already a location that is active location.  Place it in the staging area (I am paraphrasing).  There is also a new lore character that was included.  One thing that was nice about the expansion is you get THREE COPIES OF EACH RESOURCE CARD.  I was extremely happy to see this especially since if you want at least three copies of all cards you needed to buy three copies of the base set.  I really hope FFG continues with this.  It is really awesome only having to buy one expansion deck for each set.  Thanks FF!

Thank you for the update. Maybe that store had a preview event and had a couple left over?

We've already been spoiled of all the player cards, but thankfully I haven't seen the quests or encounter cards anywhere yet. I'd prefer not to as well.

Personally, I think we should all see it by either the 15th or 22nd at the latest. I mean, it was supposed to be in May right?

Really?  Did FFG put the spoiler list up or someone else?  I didn't even know it was out!

It's in a thread here, it's on page 6 right now.

I wouldn't rely on any release dates in general. There are too many variables that can send things off the rails, even slightly.

Officially, release date for gollum is set to 21st of July, as per polish publisher.

Finally!

 I can't wait... Gollum sure is a slippery fellow :DDDD

 

But he won't be dodging my fellowship for long ;-)

The more I think about the whole delay I get the impression that all the localized versions are already in stock of the publishers but are held back bc they are pressumably not allowed to sell the European versions before the original English version gets to the stores...?!? We know that the English version is delaed until 20th July bc of the shiping issues. Dont think that the Polish, German etc versions are on the very same ship...

Do you guys think that this means they also have one or more of the other expansions in their stores now too? Or do you think they ship each expansion pack seperately?

I hope it's the former, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's the latter.

 Yeah, I wish too, but the other four expansions are still listed at the printers and the last one hasn't even been announced yet.

****, i hope they will make up for this delay and try to get the other out asap....otherwise the game will defenitly lie in my shelf for a while.

The only thing to beat for me and my wife leaft is the "helping friends" community scenario and some campaign or nightmare modes... ;(

Dont worry my friend HFG very easy so after 2 3 days of playing you will get bored. If you waiting so long you will be dissapointed....

Hmm, yeah, i get what you mean but if you get the chance, try playing "helping friends" with 3 or 4 players. So, far, we did not beat it with one core.  Ok, the 3rd player has been always a newbie so far, but still. It's really challenging.

Play 2 players beat easy already. Sometimes solo i lose. actually not any one custom quest i good enough. Helping friends is the best but still.....
