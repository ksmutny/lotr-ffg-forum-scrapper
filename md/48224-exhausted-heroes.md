 New to the game! When heroes are exhausted in the quest phase do they remain exhausted throught the engagement and combat phases. Can they be refreshed after the quest phase? Thanks in anticipation.

Hi there! Welcome to the game.

Heroes only refresh in the refresh phase or by a card effect. So exhaust them wisely!
