Just wondering what you need to use these new POD Mines of Moira and Escape from Kazhad dum I have the core set and the first 3 saga boxes and both hobbit boxes would what i have work or do i need the Kazhad dum cycle ?

You do not need any encounter cards from either core or KD/Dwarrowdelf -- all the quest and encounter cards you need are in the POD already.
