I was wondering if there was a list of artists names that have been working on this project.

Unfortunately I can't seem to read the illustrator credits on the particular cards.

## 2 [Rathmaker on December 2, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39106-artists/?do=findComment&comment=392128)

I have not seen any listed, and I cannot completely make out the names on the card images so far. 

All I know is the art on the cards is completely gorgeous!

Here are some of the Artists I've noticed so far. Most of them have their own website and many are on deviantart.com

Tony Foti (Gimli)

Sandara (Young Marsh Drake)

Tiziano Baracchi (Thorin)

Katherine Dinger

Sedone (on a demo card)

Gabrielle Portal (Eowyn)

You certainly do have "elven eyes"...and I thank them!

I'm wondering who does the "wandering took"...

## 7 [Dam the Man on December 3, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39106-artists/?do=findComment&comment=392450)

The "blur" is in the same shape as Tony Foti on the Gimli card, so that would be my guess.

## 8 [Narsil0420 on December 3, 2010](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39106-artists/?do=findComment&comment=392616)

Yeah, spot on Dam.

You guys should also check out Kevin Childress' web page at http://kevinchildress.carbonmade.com [http://kevinchildress.carbonmade.com] (he's listed as the main artist on BGG's page)

It looks like he did a lot of the graphic design and layout for the game. He's got some great images on his page even though some of them are demo cards and might be changed in the final draft.

Those images are really nice.  The seem to look more detailed than any that FFG posted so far.  I am specifically referring to the card layouts.  I had a lukewarm reaction when looking at them on FFG's site, but here...they look phenominal.  Even the cardbacks look really nice on his site where they looked just ok on the main site.

Wow the images on that website are just beautiful!  

I really cannot wait to get my hands on this game when it comes out.

*Edit: Upon looking at the pictures further I am wondering what all of the tokens are for?  There is one image in his gallery for the LOTR LCG that has 3 tokens on it.  The one (in the upper left) looks like it could be for wounds.  The bottom one looks to designate a hero that is questing (???), and the third one is a freakin' stargate! lol

Good gaming to all of you!

Yeah, I think you're right about the wounds. The feet on the path marker, I think, is for marking progress on the quests (each one needs a certain amount to complete) and the "Stargate" marker (ha ha!) is probably for marking resources that a character has generated.

Lius Lasahido has put up a couple of his art pieces on deviantart.com. It's the "Gondorian" picture used on the "Feint" card and another piece called "Rangers" whose card hasn't been seen yet. I really love his work!

Daryl Mandryk: Box Cover



Is the box cover this image here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_public/img_catalogo/lotr_lcg_col.jpg]? Because that is some nice work, and really makes the game come alive for me whenever I visit this webpage.

## 19 [Toqtamish on April 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39106-artists/?do=findComment&comment=452487)

Yes it is just on the box image is reversed from that one.

I wrote to Katherine Dinger and she sent me the original Glorfindel picture (and an early draft!). What a nice lady!

 That is absolutely brilliant; I wonder whether FFG will release some kind of compilation of the artwork for the cards.

They have done two art books for AGoT and one for CoC, so it is entirely possible.
