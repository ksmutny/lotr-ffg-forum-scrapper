A few new player cards spoiled. Not much, though. But a nice secrecy touch.

And several encounter ones aswell:

And right here we can see a sneak peek at new spirit ally, which costs a hefty 3 but is not unique:

The Leave brooch is interesting. Like that its a neutral attachment. Certain decks could get quite a boost. (and I see that mono sphere's haven't been left behind either... i'm guessing this is intentional).

 

I wonder if there will be any similar secrecy giving attachments that will work for allies or attachments well?

The front of AP boxes has typically been Encounter/Quest card art.

My gosh, Arwen has aged a bit from the art work on her ally card, but it looks like we will be getting her as the new spirit hero. ha ha.

But seriously, my guess is she is Dunedain, possibly the hero card. If it is it's probably another FFG created hero.

## 10 [Karlson on February 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=973126)

Yes, I'm thinking the Adventure Pack artwork is a Dunedain ranger, perhaps an ally or objective ally for the quest.  

 

I wish that Raven's Guard was a Tactics Ally.  That guy looks freakin' awesome!  I really couldn't be happier with the direction this cycle has taken early on: Elves, Dunedain, and Secrecy... Three very underdeveloped themes in the game so far.  This particular pack also looks like it will add some amazing player cards for Hobbit themed decks.  I can't wait!

## 11 [legolas18 on February 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=973128)

She looks too noble to be an enemy. If she is the new hero, she will almost definitely be made up. I don't think Magali would change her drawing if it was Arwen.

Classic.

 

But in other games the Dunlendings have been portrayed as very animistic and superstitious, so I bet the antler crown is to do with that. Hopefully it summons some kind of Valar orbital strike to be used in later encounters. :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

The broach on the box art... Boy I hope that's not Arwen.

Edit: Here's the thing that I can't get out of my head. I think it unlikely that we get two female spirit heros in the cycle. So if that's not Arwen then maybe we're not getting her. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

i bet it's quest card art (following previous patterns) but, it certainly could be a player card.

 

if memory serves, the AP box art has only been a player card's art three times (Haldir, Elladan, Gondorian Discipline). not that that really means anything! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Yeah, my bet it is a Objective-Ally... meaning it could become a player card latter (or a enemy like Lord Acelron)... Also I think it is defiantly a Duradain, reminds me of Beravor even.

I really hope FFG have started to realize it is fine to make up some characters of there own. We could do with a few more girls in this game.

I hope It is not Arwen on the pack. But I do not like that star she has.

The quest: sounds like some fairytale. Find 3 guardians and take their keys to get an artifact. But I like that each guardian uses Time X.

The release made a big deal about the Leaf Brooch and how useful it would be. Now, I'm a newbie and I'm still making my way through Shadows of Mirkwood, but is secrecy THAT useful? How likely/easy is it that you can keep your threat below 20?

I love Spirit so can't wait to see the info on the new ally! (Even though it will be ages until I get there!)

This all gets a big thumbs up from me! This quest looks like fun, and I wonder how this boss battle will differ from the Morgul Vale (also has a three boss battle). The secrecy support is huge and I predict that Leaf Brooch alone will make secrecy a much more viable mechanic. The next thing that's needed is a hero or attachment that raises your secrecy level to 25 to make a lot of the older quests more secrecy friendly.

 

I like the art on the box and would love to get that character as a hero. It's nice to see a female character who looks strong and tough and could hold her own in a fight against a pack of wargs. Don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Arwen, Naith Guide and Galadhrim Minstrel, but I also think there's a place for female characters who look just as tough as Boromir.

Nice preview.

 

The quest looks like a lot of fun, as they say it's replayability is high, and with those undead guardians and all as a theme.

 

Though they state a spirit hero's coming, there's just no way to guess/know who the woman on the front of the pack is. 

Might be the hero, might be an ally of any sphere. I agree that see looks to fair to be a encouter card though.

My single guess on this picture is that it is not an elf. She looks very human, so I don't think it's Arwen.

Maybe a Dunedain spirit hero; made up female character.

 

Also they rave about the brooch in the article, but I'm not convinced.

Events are played and then gone, so people usually only add those really powerful/needed ones to their deck.

Allies and attachments stay in play. Way better, so why make a deck full of events?

Noiceless Movement let's you recycle it with secrecy though....then it might be the first of these type of events.

Otherwise I don't see the point.

## 25 [Scroll Lock on February 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=973609)

I really don't think that box art is our new heroine.

But so and so I think that this pack will be secrecy pack (as Druadan Forest was monosphere pack) and we will get some secrecy hero. I have written it in other topic but I will write it here, too. I hope so much we will get spirit Haldir who reduces your threat for playing secrecy cards... So much!

But I am surprised that we haven't seen a single Rohan card spoiled in AP previews.

Sorry for my bad English.

Noccus, secrecy decks use a lot of events so the brooch would pay huge dividends over the course of a game. There are many ways to recycle event cards from your discard pile (dwarven tomb, Hama, plus all the books/scrolls/tomes from the last cycle) so I see the brooch as getting a lot of action and being a key part of the secrecy deck. One of the complaints about secrecy is that it just wasn't worth it, it was still too expensive to play the cards to get so little in return. The brooch goes a long way towards relieving that problem and makes 2-hero secrecy decks a viable play style.

## 27 [monkeyrama on February 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=973631)

Plus, secrecy stacks, so the brooch can combine with current secrecy cards (Timely Aid) and make them completely free. The game really seems to be shifting away from the early focus on resource as the only way to do anything, and lots of 'em, to offering different avenues to afford cards, and that's quite exciting. Even card draw is diversifying.

## 28 [Noccus on February 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=973633)

@Style75:

 

Oh I play secrecy decks every now and then, but I don't use that many events I must say; secrecy or not.

Maybe we just build very different decks.

 

I agree on your reasoning that there are enough cards to recycle events now though.

Didn't look that far yet; good point. Does make it more wothwile probably.

 

And I'm very happy they are finally futher developing secrecy. I've always liked it.

This brooch will find a good home in mono-sphere secrecy decks no doubt, as they stack.

I agree. I think the most interesting aspect of this upcoming cycle is that the designers are giving us new ways to do things. This will dramatically increase the number of viable deck types as we get alternatives to those essential cards we see in every deck.

 

I still think the game could do with a massive infusion of player cards (even just a one-off "deluxe player pack" or something like that) to enable alternative deck building, but without that the next best thing are cards like the brooch that make other existing cards more playable.

Not really quote, but 'deluxe player pack' words give me an idea:

 

You get free deluxe little packs (5 player cards, for example) when you exchange in the shop your Proofs of Purchases.

:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Maybe about cycles: if you exchange all the Proofs of Purchases of 1 entire cycle (for example, Khazad Dum with Dwarrofdelf), you get the 'Deluxe mini-pack' of player cards.

Leaf Brooch is a passive effect, so if you play a 0 cost card like Daeron's Runes or Elrond's Counsel it will also trigger there and be useless the rest of the round for an event card you intend to play later, so it does have a slight negative effect since you can not control which event it will trigger on. I am still quite intrigued but the jury is still out, resource acceleration if it is available for the deck you are playing will probably trump this card every time. It will also only work while in secrecy which is not easy to do, and will probably be more difficult with the Doom theme developing this cycle.

I'm not - I'd not expect a lot of Rohan in the actual cycle, and the articles have stated as much.

 

From the Dunland Trap article: "By the time we started working on this set [The Dunland Trap], we’d already bolstered the Dwarf, Gondor, Rohan, and Hobbit traits with heroes and allies to the point that each offered players the ability to build fun and thematic decks around them. It was high time to give Elves some more attention. "

 

In other words, by the time the 6 APs were developed, the designers felt they'd already bolstered Rohan enough (in Voice of Isenguard).

 

So, this to me, along with other comments (from this article: "the Adventure Pack also supports a wide range of player themes and mechanics that include the Noldor, Dúnedain, and Scout traits; increased interaction for multiplayer games; and the popular Secrecy mechanic that rewards players who can keep their Threat at or below twenty."), seem to suggest we will *not* see a ton of Rohan in the cycle.

 

The Voice of Isenguard will give us cool Rohan stuff - but I bet in the cycle itself we'll only get a handful of Rohan cards.

You are probably right, Dain Ironfoot. But I hope we will see at least 2 Rohan tactics heroes (including Éomer), 5 real allies (not chump blockers) and some useful attachments and events that will boost attacking to the staging area.

## 35 [Style75 on February 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=973751)

What I really hope to see from Voice of Isengard is a card that lets a Rohan hero pay for any card with the Rohan trait regardless of sphere. This is the sort of effect that is really needed in this game, something to make traits (factions) really mean something.

## 36 [Style75 on February 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=973760)

I'd also like cards that interact with the non-faction traits like healer, warrior, scout, etc.  We need something to make "Guard of the Citadel" stand out from "Pelargir Ship Captain" (a card with the same stats, same cost, same faction but lacking the warrior trait and instead having a response).  As more cards enter the game with identical stats, the value of the traits will become more important as a way of adding value to cards.

## 37 [Scroll Lock on February 4, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=973763)

I'd like to see something made especially for Théoden(rohan allies booster or the thing Style75 mentioned) , so people will use him more. If I want to make solo Rohan deck, there is no reason for me to play the king, except for theme.

the designers have said (and I wish I could remember where) that a focus on traits really isn't their design goal, but rather, a focus on developing distinct spheres.

 

now, certainly, they do give traits some love. but, it's not their express purpose to build up traits as much as it is to build up the 4 spheres and how they operate internally and are distinct from the others.

And this is a good thing IMO. The sphere distinction is the single most important aspect of game balance.

Very true.

A few weeks ago my group was discussing this around the gaming table.

We came up with the idea of a single Deluxe expansion per sphere with only player cards, as a cycle sorta.

Including 2 or 4 new heroes of that sphere too.

This would mean some 50 cards per sphere though, which might be overkill...

To those who don't like Leaf Brooch because they don't play with a lot of events: Even if you don't play many events, there are some "essential" events - like A Test of Will - which are great to be played for free. Also Secrecy depends on low threat, and most of the best cards for keeping threat low are events - most notably The Galadhrim's Greeting. If you can play TGG for 2 or less, you are golden. Not to mention, you can recycle these events (as mentioned by someone else earlier).

I am a little disappointed with Noiseless Movement, though. They make the card look really good for secrecy, by giving the card back if you're at secrecy level, but if you are at or below 20 threat, few enemies will engage you, so you'll have less use for this card. So this card is actually more useful outside of secrecy decks it seems.

Going back to female heroes: I usually don't mind when FFG makes their own heroes, as long as I like their ability. But we still haven't seen any made up female heroes in Leadership OR Tactics. I mean, I know they're the more "masculine" spheres, but it would still be interesting to see what they would be like. The only person in LOTR lore that might qualify for this would be a Tactics Eowyn, which I am really looking forward to in the future.

Guess it'll be good for all those enemies with 10 to 20 threat.  And there are plenty!

> Also Secrecy depends on low threat, and most of the best cards for keeping threat low are events - most notably The Galadhrim's Greeting. If you can play TGG for 2 or less, you are golden. Not to mention, you can recycle these events (as mentioned by someone else earlier).

This is very true and a good point, still I think it will have its place. Secrecy decks, especially in solo are often light on combat.. so stopping some of those "engage no matter what" type low threat enemy cards is still powerful, but yeah.. it is sorta trying to trick you into thinking it is better than it is, though I think if you are failing secrecy stopping a scary engagement isn't a bad idea.. spesh if your deck has weak combat, and it also gives you a turn and a resource round to get secrecy back.



> we still haven't seen any made up female heroes in Leadership OR Tactics. I mean, I know they're the more "masculine" spheres, but it would still be interesting to see what they would be like.

I completely agree on this.. What was that chick that killed the witch king? Wasn't her whole deal that she was a warrior madian type thing? She was also a lord's daughter so could fit nicely into leadership.. maybe even tactics.

That was none other than Eowyn - Spirit hero extraordinaire. I, too, would love to see a Tactics or Leadership version of her.

While browsing on Facebook, I've seen some news. 

 

It looks there are some leaked spoilers about Ring-maker Cycle. The names of the rest Adventure Packs:

 

1. - The Dunland Trap

2. - The Three Trials

3. - The Antlered Crown

4. - Throuble in Tharbad

5. - The Nin-in-Eilph

6. - Celebrimbor's Secret

 

Is this the real thing or somebody is just having some wishes?!   :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

So this card is actually more useful outside of secrecy decks it seems.

I disagree. Pippin told me he never got killed because he had a lack of resources, but because of that nasty 5 threat orc who wad taking off his head. Hobbits also have stuff like Good Meal that enables them to play events for a low cost. So while I think the brooch is ok and fine (it is indeed a good card), it's Noiseless Movement that deals with one of the major weaknesses of a secrecy deck. The fact alone that it allows you to send everyone to the quest is absolutely amazing. It's a gamesaver and one of the few cards that gives a you more flexibility when planning your turn.

 

Of course, the synergy between these two new cards makes both of them even more aweseome! :wub: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wub.png]

Pretty eowyn, yeah! (Merry not so, :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]). And the idea (Eowyn get more attack when she defends and Merry can ready, for example, Eowyn) is very good and coherent with the thematic side.

Agree here. Custom cards is most of rhe time is unbalanced boring stuff. I don't bother myself with them most of the time.

I totally understand that secrecy decks need to avoid enemies and Noiseless Movement is a great card, but less than 20% of enemies have an engagement of 20 or less and most of those are relatively weak, so most of them you can just deal with instead of using this card. Obviously, there are still plenty of situations where you'd want to get an enemy back into the staging area or prevent them from coming down. There are actually a pretty large number of cards that fulfill this purpose:

 

- Out of Sight: enemies engaged with you can't attack. You can still kill them off yourself

- Risk Some Light: keep these enemies from ever showing up

- O Elbereth! Gilthonial!: chump block with an ally and then just send it away. The requirement to block probably makes this card kinda suck for this

- Out of the Wild: Same theory as Risk Some Light, except more permanent removal

- Hobbit-Sense: You can't get attacked, like Out of Sight.

- Take No Notice: Don't let them engage

- Advance Warning: Pretty limited because it's practically impossible to build a secrecy deck with all Lore, but Pippin + Mirlonde + one of a few other heroes will at least get you started below the threshold.

- Spirit Pippin: Everyone hates him, but his ability works just fine for this with enough threat reduction.

- A Light in the Dark: been around for quite a while and is much more affordable with Leaf Brooch.

I figured she was a Dunedain ranger. Whether she's an objective ally or a hero is my main question.

maybe objective ally like Lord Alcaron (but not traitor this time ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]) which runs through the whole cycle

I hope her ability is something like "Discard Idraen to cancel a When Revealed effect".

I'd put my money that she'll be the spirit hero whos ability augments secrecy.  I feel like FFG likes using their custom made characters for hero cards that have these niche abilities like Mirlonde and Caldara (although Theoden certainly doesnt count, but the ability made sense thematically)

She's definitely rocking the Aragorn hairstyle... must be a prerequisite for becoming a Dunedain Ranger.

Wow. Just wow. I came back today from my little vacation (where I had no internet) and just saw this. I was already happy with the Dunland theme in the Dunland Trap but this is even better. Barrow locations? Antlered crowns? Hallowed circles? Forest spirits? The thematic direction they took with Dunland is exactly the one I wanted to see (or even better). This may very well be my favorite AP ever. Hope the quest is amazing. The art is, at least. Also I think the woman in the box art will be our Dunadan Spirit hero, hopefully a secrecy hero.

I think that if you folks are right then we probably won't be seeing Arwen this cycle.

With as tough as she looks, I don't see her hiding behind a tree too much, so I kinda doubt be a Secrecy hero. Then again, who better to keep secrecy than a dunedain ranger?

> Hmmmm we see picture of ffg Gwaihir aleady long time ago but he still didn come as a card......

 

It seems as though with this cycle they are trying to make each AP revolve around a certain mechanic/trait (at least with the 2 we've seen thus far).  Maybe one of the later ones they will refresh eagles and we will finally see the Windlord in all his greatness.  Even just 1 other new eagle ally and a nice unifying effect on Gwaihir such as "all eagle allies cost 1 less to a minimum of 1" would go a long way in making it a relevant archetype again

I would say most APs have done this so far. This cycles APs seem to focus on a number (say 3-ish) of mechanics/traits.

I consider myself a theme player first and foremost. I've played some powerful decks on here that didn't really appeal to me because the theme wasn't there. (And that goes to my super heroes attachment deck that I built myself.) If the Dunedain, the elves and the eagles get a shot in the arm in this cycle I'm all for it.

## 75 [Style75 on February 11, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98421-a-new-priview-is-up/?do=findComment&comment=981665)

At this point I don't think we'll see Gwaihir until the final saga box. He's the one that lead the Eagle's attack outside the gates of Mordor and then rescued the hobbits on Mt. Doom. It makes total sense for him to appear at that point in the saga. Unfortunately putting him anywhere else wouldn't make sense.
