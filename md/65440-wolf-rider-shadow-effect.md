can A Light in the Dark (Core) be used against a Wolf Rider (Core) that came out as shadow card before his attack is resolved?
To make it clearer, I deal shadow cards, Wolf rider comes out as a shoadow card so he gets to attack you and gets a shadow card, I use a light in the dark to put him in the staging area and thus he doesn't attack and his shadow card gets discarded.
If this is legit, would he still go on top on the encounter deck after the compat phase? If this is not legit then you can't use Feint (Core) either to prevent him from attacking?

Yes, I believe so. When you have to resolve an additional attack, it still follows the 4 steps presented on p. 18 of the rules. This means that there is an action window between step 1 (choose the attacker, wolf rider in this case) and step 2 (declare defender). The Rider will be moved to the staging area then, which ends the attack. Its additional shadow card will not be resolved and discarded at the end of combat phase.

Yes. After the shadow effect on Wolf Rider has been started to resolve (i.e. not having been cancelled via Hasty Stroke), there is no way of stopping the effect. So the Rider will be put back to the encounter deck.

(There is one special exception - when you kill the Rider. This is because card effects (the Rider's shadow effect) don't deal with cards in an out-of-play-state (e.g. the killed Rider in the discard pile), unless they explicitly state so.)

 thanks, that's what I thought, just wanted to be sure because on BGG I got different answers saying quite the opposite but I wasn't really convinced
