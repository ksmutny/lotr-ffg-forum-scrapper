Okay, I just couldn't resist designing another scenario, and I know quite a few of you over on these forums are still following my stuff. Hopefully it's a lot harder than my previous efforts, which have occasionally been criticised as too easy. I also genuinely wanted to move the difficulty level up towards the level of Escape From Dol Guldur without being as 'impossible'.

FYI - I tried it out originally with a 'Doom Track' of Resource Tokens on the scenario cards which indicated a set number of turns to complete it. But this proved to be either too hard or not relevant enough, and the balance was too difficult to attain. So as long as you're still keeping those Will of the West cards out of your deck you should have fun with it!

 

Here it is:

Enjoy!

I've tried all your other scenarios at least once, with our only fail on The Old Forest, due more to deck choices than scenario strength. I look forward to trying this one out as well. It looks tough with no allies for 20 progress.

Yeah, get those allies in early - you're gonna need them!  Hey, did you ever go back and beat The Old Forest then?

Good stuff. One minor point: Ungoliant's Spawn doesn't have victory points so no need to mention those on the quest cards.

OK thanks. I try another scenarios of yours and they was to easy for me.

So lets try this one. Hope this one will be more fun.

Good catch!  That's left over from when the Nazgul was still in the quest.  Oops...

I hate this strategy wen you must slow down things in the first quest card build all your fellowship and then you can easy complete the scenario.

Maybe if you replace the spider with the Nazgul it will be more interesting cause now a forest snare owns this scenario.

Sorry you feel that way mate.

Not sure how you'd use Forest Snare in that third stage, and your 'strategy' theoretically applies to any official scenario too.

Still: can't please everyone.  happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

Don't worry mate i don't hate your scenario but the method with forest snare thats why i like the new text of the Nazgul.I will try your scenario but i will replace the spider with the Nazgul.Ofcourse you can keep your threat low and the Nazgul can't engage you but a i can home rule this.Somethink like if you have 10 progress tokens on the quest card you must engage Nazgul after 3 turns (or somethink like this).

And yes you are right the same strategy counts for the official scenarios thats why they must find a way to brake this.

Sounds fair.  Hey, if it plugs the time until FFG's ex packs come out it can't be that bad, eh?  gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Your scenarios gave me some extra solo fun than just play the second scenario over and over again(official scenario 1 is too easy and third you know....) so thanks a lot.Also you made me think my own scenarios but unfortunatly i don't have your talent so most of them end up as a disaster lol.

 I hear you - ironically the only way we've beaten the third scenario is in nightmare mode!
