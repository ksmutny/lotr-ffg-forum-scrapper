 One thing I find interesting is that Radagast is an Ally that produces resources like a hero (Specialized resources but still resources). If there are more Allies like this and more cards like Steward of Gonder then it would make 1 or 2 Hero decks more feasible.

We will have to see what creature cards we get, but Radagast appears to be powerful enough that he will have decks shaped around him.  Sounds like Eagles are tactics.  I can't wait to find out what other spheres have creatures.

## 5 [faith_star83 on April 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44997-radagast/?do=findComment&comment=451203)

Already love the card and looking forward to this adventure pack!

Radagast seems quite versatile: He can help summon creatures (most likely eagles?) and even heal characters! Also looking forward to meet Haldir.

If the post's statement about the release refers to the actual date of the post it would mean that two weeks from April 8th the game will be available! That's the 22nd of April! gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]

 An image of Haldir's card, for those who are interested:

I am very excited about the Eagles for tactics sphere. I wonder if they will just be allies or might be a hero one too. Some of the Eagles were fairly major in the stories.

## 8 [Bohemond2 on April 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44997-radagast/?do=findComment&comment=451227)

Thanks, Ygrams.

Looks like Lore is getting the love in terms of early heroes.  Now my Elven Lore/Tactics Deck has the heroes I need to make it work.  Haldir is amazing in multi-player. I find it interesting that Lore seems to be the deck that is shaping up to have the second most combat power.

Sounds like, just allies.  At least for now.

Haldir is an ally, not a hero.

Ack, i totally missed that.  I was just so excited about my elven army. Mayhap you could get your Eagle hero, in that case.

## 12 [Toqtamish on April 8, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44997-radagast/?do=findComment&comment=451234)

I hope so. Would be cool to see.

## 13 [9thimmortal on April 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44997-radagast/?do=findComment&comment=452240)

Some strong allies to be sure.  Espeically R who is making resources (limited, yes, but still).  Like Servant I think I will have too many allies in my decks!

Well, yeah. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Especially considering your deck will have zero heroes in it.

## 16 [servant of the secret fire on April 11, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44997-radagast/?do=findComment&comment=452330)

Heroes are part of your deck.You may not shuffle your heores wen you shuffle your deck but without heroes you don't have a deck.

For sure i will try a deck with Radagast,Gandalf and Eagles(if this is possible or if it  works) and later wen Galadriel comes live i will try to mix all those characters in my deck(i am almost sure that this will not be easy especially if Galadriel is not a hero).

As for heroes i am not so sure yet.I like Legolas and Gimli but spirit sphere looks a little more interesting to me.

Anyway i can have my favorite character (Gandalf) with all spheres so this is not a big promblem for me lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

That was one of my first thoughts about this game: allies will play a big role and I will definitely play them a lot. Although no doubt there will be cards in the encounter deck that specifically target that strategy.

As per the rulebook page 5 "There are also hero cards, which do not belong to any deck."

I agree ClydeCloggie allies will have a large role and there will very likely be cards that specifically target them. I am sure there will also be cards that specifically protect them too.

 What if his name was Bradagast, and he was a complete tool?

I definitely had the same two thoughts. Legolas and Gimli, adventuring together as best buddies! And then, a little Spirit magic to round out the deck (including the lady of the deck, Eowyn). And Gandalf is definitely going in every deck, even though I like Radagast better. Rad is a little more specific in his uses, so I may not always use him.

Yea this is the promblem with Radagast.You can't use him alone like Gandalf.Radagast without his creatures it will be a waste for your deck.

A future adventure with the White Council as heroes it  will be great gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].
