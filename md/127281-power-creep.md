Card like Galadhon archer, Wandering Ent, the new Gandalf, the tree people, Gwahir, Tighten Our Belts,  Wingfoot, and Galadriel (hero and ally) make me wonder. In my opinion the "against the shadow" cycle was pretty weak (op outlands aside). This one and the last two big expansions are full of playables.

## 2 [Bullroarer Took on November 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1337549)

I think both cycles have a decent number of playables.  Adding Silvan is what is making this cycle seem better because people are discarding outlands (and often Gondor).  (New Gandalf wasn't from the cycle btw.)

## 3 [player1922162 on November 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1337630)

Silvan power creep, sure. But among the viable traits they are still far behind all the others.

## 4 [Arie90 on November 17, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1337676)

I think that silvan are better then rohan and gondor (and there is more to come). Although, "mass healing combo" (Elrond-tracker) aside, I think they are still worst then dwarfs and outlands.

I got Celebrimbor's Secret today and I'm very excited about trying the new cards. The Wandering Ent has great stats for its price - immediately put 3 into my lore/spirit deck (sorry, Master of the Forge)!

Silvans are great and all, but I'm not a big fan of keeping track of bouncy effects. I'm hoping for some Noldor love in the Angmar cycle.

I wouldn't call VoI cycle cards power  creep, just really solid. Unlike late Dwarrowdelf and HoN box.

I think that its pretty unavoidable to have some level of power creep, however I think the current balance is pretty good. The new cycle of quests, that I have played so far, are good mix of difficulty and I really like a lot of the new player cards.

 

my understanding the designers/developers are focusing on creating creating different types of player deck options rather than more powerful ones and believe they are doing a good job. 

 

I agree that Gandalf & Galadriel are particularly strong heroes (though Gandalf is from the from the saga's).

I see it more as spreading the power out. I doubt that we will ever see heroes on the level of Spirit Glorfindel or Dain Ironfoot. This is a good thing - if anything those earlier heroes are too powerful. Silvan is a powerful archetype, particularly in multiplayer where you can have other decks cover the weaknesses (which it certainly has). I don't see it as being more powerful than the Dwarf or Noldor decks that were possible after the Dwarrowdelf cycle and Hobbit Saga expansions.

 

Galadriel is powerful, but it takes some setup, and the right pairings, to really take advantage of her abilities. I definitely do not see Galadriel+Nenya as being more powerful than Elrond+Vilya, but she is perfect from a thematic perspective. Gandalf is definitely one of the most powerful heroes to be released in a while, but like Elrond, his high starting threat brings its own challenges, and he represents a strategy that can take a few rounds to get fully setup. Quick-hitting scenarios will continue to challenge decks that do not operate at something approaching full-strength in the early rounds.

 

By focusing on supporting new traits and archetypes, I think the developers are doing a good job of avoiding the kind of rampant power creep seen in many other card games. Ultimately, the scenarios are getting more difficult (overall - there are obviously individual exceptions) to help offset the power creep that is somewhat inevitable in every card game. Many players - myself included - strive to design more thematic decks, which is a downward pressure on power creep that you would not often see in a competitive game.

Gandalf hero is a little overpowered (so is his Staff) but everything else so far seems fine. Yes Galadriel is great also but she cannot quest attack or defend.

## 10 [chrsjxn on November 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1337902)

I don't think Gandalf is overpowered, actually. He's very good, but he's pretty much just Elrond with a different set of requirements.

 

And I actually think the development recently is interesting. With The Road Darkens in this cycle, they've set up really powerful Ally versions of some very popular heroes (and Bilbo), so you have to pick whether your deck (or your set of decks for multiplayer) is better off with the hero version or the ally version. And it's not always a straightforward choice.

Nothing? You didn't use her to draw and lower your threat?

Her ability:

 

Galadriel cannot quest, attack, or defend. Allies you control do not exhaust to quest during the round they enter play.

Action: Exhaust Galadriel to choose a player. That player reduces his threat by 1 and draws 1 card. (Limit once per round.)

 

Where do you get the idea that she needs to be discarded?

Regarding "Empty Mug" - wasn't sure if her action qualified as a card effect...

 

"While The Empty Mug is in the victory display, the current quest gains "Forced: After a player card effect reduces a player's threat, remove it from the game."

Oh. I haven't played it so I didn't know about that. Yeah, that would remove her, but you should have been able to use her at least once before you explored it and her passive ability should have been useful.

This is true - Her passive ability and resource gathering was still very helpful... I guess she was just more passive than normal, till Nenya got out into play at least.

I don't think we have power creep. I think it spiked after Dwarrowdelf, but mostly I think the new cards have been similar to the core set or weaker. 

## 19 [joezim007 on November 18, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1338030)

I agree with Dan. We haven't seen a ton of "vertical" power growth. Mostly things have expanded more "horizontally" meaning we've been gaining more powers moreso than we've been getting stronger power. There are certainly some cards, though, that are pushing the power limits, but overall I think we have seen a lot of balance.

I used to play quests blind, but with my limited free time I can't afford to do that any more. I might only have one chance to play a quest, before other responsibilities take priority. I don't want to waste a game where I have absolutely no chance to win. If only a bear didn't have to slay trolls to pay the bills...

I still love the surprise of playing blind... even though that exactly what you says often happens to me... not sure if this means I'm a slow learner or really love surprises!

This becomes increasingly true for me. On the other hand I really enjoy the explorative first game - I don't really want to give it up even though it's harder to win these days, and that loss might be my only game of the week :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

This is happening to me, too. These days I sometimes I barely manage to get in one game a fortnight...whereas when the game was released (and I was a University student) I had almost unlimited game time :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

But still, I always play quests blindly the first two times...but the drawback is that there are still some quests in the AtS cycle, that I played only once! But since this is no competitive game where I have to keep up with a meta or anything, I just play at my own pace...

 

But I already planned in some extra game time for the Christmas / New Year break this year :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I always play it blind. I also do nto bother reading the spoilers and news announcements.

One other thing I seam to do differently is that I like to make decks for each quest. Deckbuilding is the real game for me. I much prefer it to playing in some ways.. playing is just a byproduct of deck testing :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Anyway, when I get a new pack I make a new deck with that hero and as many cards as I can from it, then play the quest blind.



> powerful Ally versions of some very popular heroes (and Bilbo)

hey! Bilbo is one of the best heros in the game for solo! I love that dude :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Though I rarely use him now as it makes it to easy :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

As for the thread theme, I think Galadriel is a tiny bit overpowered. I'd prefered to have her without WP and ring, but with a starting threat of 4 instead.

That would be more overpowered not less. Currently she pays 1 for her ability (which is good) and 4 for her willpower that she can't use without drawing into another item (taking up deck space, and that you have to spend resources on). 

If instead she got 4 hitpoints and her ability for 4 (or even 5, if you were just trying to say you wanted her stats to be 0 and 0 cost). She would be amazing. 

You could run Galadrial + Glorfindel for a threat cost of 9 (or 10). You'd draw two cards a turn and get two resources a turn, while offsetting Glorfindels disadvantage (until you got Light of Valinor, when you would instead offset threat gain entirely). You could run secrecy for 10 turns assuming you quested successfully every time.

I mean sure, these two are a powerful secrecy deck anyway, but having draw 1 card and reduce threat by one, to be only 4 threat would be ridiculous. 

 

Her ability is arguably power creep (It means you can negate the threat gain at the end of the round forever - which is definitely a new power). Getting it for threat cost 4 would be absurd. Personally I think she should be threat cost 10, rather than 9.

## 35 [leptokurt on November 21, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1342612)

Yep, her threat is definitely too low. She's fun to play, I have to say that, but I'm worried that she becomes the new Glorfindel -  ahero that is able to crack every scenario. Same goes for Gandalf.

To be honest i still didn use a Gandalf hero.... In my opinion he require very special deck building. 

i see he is cool with Elrond hero but I'm sick about Elrond for now...Any other hero options with Gandalf? Just few of them in my opinion..... And he is mostly solo hero since in coop every one wonna use Gandalf ally...

## 37 [Tracker1 on November 22, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127281-power-creep/?do=findComment&comment=1342877)

I think Galadriel may be a tad bit better than Gandalf. She can fit into a lot more different types of decks and for 9 threat not so bad, and for certain decks she can even oust Glorfindel from the line up.

Her ability to draw a card and lower threat each round may be one of the most powerful in the game for solo play depending on the type of deck, of course she's no Dain, but when playing with her it's like time stands still with no threat increase at the end of the round, as long as questing is strong she can keep most threats away until you want to encounter them.

Also in ally heavy decks, the ability to let them quest with out tapping upon entering play gives a huge action advantage, which makes up for her not being able to do much else unless she has Nenya.

I would have liked her to have 1 or 2 less WP and 1 or 2 points of def that she could grant to a defender with Nenya in the same fashion. I really don't find the WP boost to be that big of a deal, but 1 or 2 points of Def would make me consider using her ability often, which could make my use of the threat lowering and card draw less often.

Gandalf is really good, but he is a bit limited in the type of decks he fits into.

Being able to play and see top card of the deck is pretty amazing, but I think the thereat reduction and normal card draw gives Galadriel the edge at least for my tastes.
