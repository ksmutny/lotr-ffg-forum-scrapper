how many of you that have been here from the start are still playing as much as you did at the core release?

i dont really play anything else so i have to admit i still play the same amount (alot!) , i had a month where there was a bit of a slow down, then i got caught up on packs so that re ignited my love for this game

lol, this thread is so NOT what i thought it would be.

Yes I still play a lot, a few solo games a week, I have a regular weeklyish 3 player game and a 2 player partner I play with as well, though not as much as I want to really, just hard to both be readhy at same time. I got my copy of CORE about 2 weeks after release, but only really started getting into it after CatC came out, then I got 2 more core and havn't looked back.

When the Star Wars game comes out I might slow down a bit, as well, it is co-op, it is solitair and it is Star Wars original trillogy... so if thet game is as good as this one for me SWars will win... but for now I plan to play both.

Well, when the game first came out, I played it (or rather tried playing it) about two times.  I found the rules very complicated at first and I actually put the game down (mainly because I needed to concentrate on my classes in college anyway).  Well, time was passing, and I kept buying each adventure pack (I love original LOTR artwork), I wasn't really playing much up until Carrock.  Then, as I gradually got the hang of the rules, and played enough to figure out how to win, I was quite hooked.  In fact, the most I have played (at least once a day) has been of here of late.  I should also mention that these last couple of weeks have been the closing of my Fall semester at NCSU...;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png].  Playing this game is so much easier and more fun than studying for exams!

I still play it as much as I did when the game was released, mainly trying to complete each quest with solo sphere decks. I get a couple 2 player games as well, when I can get my fellow play to come over.

I play from beginning and until now. Still very interesting about the game, waiting for the tournaments system.

Pretty much the normal 12-18 plays per month, two to three quests, although slowly unplayed quests are finally running low. Well, at least until KD brings out three new quests, then I'm backlogged again sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif] .

Still the same and still wishing I had time for more - about 10 solo games a week with one or two multiplayer games on many weeks.

When I bought this game in early summer, I didn't play very often due to the complicated rules. But oer time when I got used to them I started to play regularly und now in the cold and dark winter time I enjoy this game even more. Thanks to the juicebox tournaments which gave my playing activities an additional boost happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

I'm playing as obsessively or MORE from the beginning til now. There was kind of a lull though between the core set and HfG though, obviously. I'm really starting to enjoy this game on another level, and that's the "living" aspect of it. It's so cool, even within the first AP cycle, so see cards that you never thought would be played get new life through the release of a different new card.

Much more than at the beginning. There are more deck building opportunities and more quests, simple

Same here I was playing a ton more when it first came out and in the summer.  Then classes got in the way.  Luckily I have 1 more final on monday then I can hopefully play a lot more during the break between semesters.  I agree though this game is much easier and more fun than studying for finals!!

I play much more than I did when the core set was the only option. I grow to love the game more and more.

I'm really new here but I still play the Call of Cthulhu LCG, and I'm sure I'll be playing this one for much much much longer.

 I don't really play that much anymore. I have all the APs, but haven't played them. None of my friends like playing it.  The game feels like it plays itself, but only because actions and reactions seem obvious. I'd prefer a PC version of this game since I am stuck playing it alone.

 My schedule (work, family, school) really dictates how much I can play. Unfortunately that means not much right now, but if given the time I would certainly pick up. I do play this more than any other game I currently own. I also listen to the two podcasts out there (cotr and fotc) to get my fix.

Qwerty - You might want to try it solo.  It actually plays very well solo, although I believe it is harder than multiplayer (don't want to rehash that thread, please).  My experience with the core set and APs over a couple hundred plays (solo and multi- player) with different decks is that it is certainly NOT the game playing itself or that the actions are obvious in most cases.  My experience is that your decisions and strategies in both deck building and game play will usually be the biggest factor in the outcome - obviously that is not always the case, but I'd say it is the rule and not the exception. May not be for you, but if that is your concern I'd give it another shot.

And your presence in the tournaments has been great OnkelZorni.

Thanks for helping to make them so much fun!

I certainly don't play as much anymore. When HfG and CaC came out, my girlfriend and me played a lot out of them, just as much as the cire set, but interest has waned over the last couple of APs. When a new one arrives, we play that about 5 times and then go on playing something else. I still think the most interesting quests come from the Core Set, with CaC coming in right behind. But Emyn Muil or Dead Marshes? Boring and not well-designed...

You right. DM and EM was really bad!!! many players around me stop to play in this moment.My community is broke up cose if you already build up decks which can win against Osgiliath in August so next 2 quests DM And EM(september, Oktober) is just walking in the park with bandage on the eyes.

I still not get RTM but look like this one is good.So we will gather together again!!!

The most important part of this game is Quests and Encounter cards. If they will make boring and easy quests game will die very quick.

But they understand this so second cycle looks much more better then the first one according the preview articles.

So the bigest my hope lies on the Second cycle.

I play at lot less mostly because I stopped playing solo. I expect to play a bit more between the years, though.

We never really stopped playing for a long period, although we went through various "phases" one could say.

Phase 1: Getting the core set and playing the quests with the four starter decks over and over... But we never really liked playing "Escape from Dol Guldur" much, because we found it a bit too difficult. (Since then it has become one of our favorites, because of that extra difficulty...)

Phase 2: Feeling the need to get a second core set, because of the limited deck building options. After that we started to build two new decks, one leadership/lore and one spirit/tactics, also "upgrading" to 50 cards per player deck. The impact of this was huge. And we played even more games after that...

Between Phase 2 and 3 and during a holiday in Ireland I discovered the Cardboard of the Rings podcast! And the rest of the summer we waited for the arrival of "Hunt for Gollum".

Phase 3: This is where the game really started to shine, because the adventure packs started to come out regularly! Since then we've continued playing, improved our decks and also went back to plow through some of the older quests.

A short while ago and after the release of the Dead Marshes we went back to building mono-sphere decks which has turned out to be also great fun...
