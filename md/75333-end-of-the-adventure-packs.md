So, I keep hearing that we will be seeing the end of the adventure pack releases and that we are FFG will just release the larger expansion boxes from now on.  But it looks like there is at least one more AP cycle that hasn't really kicked off yet, Against the Shadow. 

Where are the rumors coming from about the adventure packs?

its a change in releases for call of chutulu, one of their other lcg's. when it was announced a lot of people assumed this method of release would be applied to all the other lcg's, even though FFG said it was only for chutulu.

this was rumoured on the forum before HON was first previewed. there is nothing to go on that the same will happen to lotr. its just speculation

It makes more sense for a competitve game to get fewer realeases with a better balance of cards (you won't  have to wait 3 packs to get a combo anymore)

 

For a co-op game though, I actually think the little expansions make more sense - the big ones come with lots of extra monster carfds but only a minor increase in player cards.You really want to release lots of small packs to keep interest throughout the year (since you don't have tournaments or competitive play to keep interest - and if people lose interest they may stop buying altogether).

And don't forget, COC has been out for 8 years or so.

I completely agree Rapier!

Thanks for the info.  

I love CoC, but haven't played in years due to the difficulty in finding players in my area.  I supose the expansion release style may work for that game, but I'd hate to see it extended to LotR.  I love this game because of the ability to play one player, and I love the Adventure Packs, since it is essentially a new game every time I get one and at 12-14 bucks a month, I don't feel like I'm being bled dry each time one comes out.

If you listen to the Cardboard of the Rings podcast, Caleb revealed to the team that the LotR:LCG line is one of the most profitable products. I can't see them messing a formula that is currently working. I think this game has a solid future ahead of it.
