***Edit: Resolved***

 

So tonight my store had their Fellowship event, and this was the first time I was able to attend one. I was under the impression based on the articles online here from FFG, that each participant would receive the mat, promo card, and deck pack. At my event,  it was one set per table. Assuming each item goes to one person, that means in a game of four there's one person that gets nothing.

Is that normally how things go? Did my store run it wrong? Granted I did an early sign up to secure a seat and didn't ask so maybe this is normal and I misunderstood. My store definitely did not have enough stock to give more than one set to each table. If this is normal it kinda makes it not worth it to go really.

The event was fun, but it was a little expensive if you have a 25% chance of walking away with nothing when you can just wait for the product to come out and pay roughly the same price to own it.

The sentence above the image of the playmat is what I'm referencing: https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/8/24/the-woodland-realm/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/8/24/the-woodland-realm/]

--------------------------------------------------------------

Edit:

Just for anyone who reads this in the future, this was resolved. My store got in touch with FFG to clarify a few things, and wound up ordering more kits to cover the players as one kit per player, rather than the initial one kit per table they had ordered.

My store contacted me and then I was able to pick up the entire kit with no issue.

From what I understand each kit comes with 4 copies of everything, not 3. (there's even an ebay listing for the entire kit). I hope the store is not keeping a few for themselves to scalp later or whatnot.

I've been to four Fellowship events over the past years, including 2018, and all participants received the mat and deck.

You should have received the lot.  Disappointing to hear.

I've been to every Fellowship event.  For every event in the past, all participants received the mat and the scenario with the alt art card.

In the past, they did event nights with Nightmare quests-- this was before they came up with the term 'Fellowship event.'  I don't know whether all participants received the Nightmare quest, for the Nightmare events, as I didn't go to any.

However, it's really up to the store, not FFG, regarding who gets what.  FFG sells the kits to the store, then the store can do whatever they want with them, as far as I understand.  If they want, they can have people pay $20 just to participate, and receive nothing, there's no FFG rule or legal reason that they couldn't have an event and just charge people to participate.  That's a bad business model, though.

This year, I think one Fellowship "kit" contains only 1 copy of the scenario, or maybe 2?  It says it 'supports 4 players,' which should mean 2 scenarios, as the quest is intended as a 2 versus 2 team event. But I'm guessing here, I haven't been to my Fellowship event this year-- it's scheduled to occur in a couple of weeks.

In any case, I do know that my event only has 4 kits total, which meant 4 scenarios/mats.  So only 4 players will receive that.  However, they stated they could support 16 players.  Players who participate, but  who don't get to keep the kit, don't have to pay to play.  Only the player receiving the kit had to pay.

My guess is just that FFG's kit this year included something different from what stores expected.  So you're seeing different stores handle the problem in different ways.

I'll also say that giving one player the mat, one player the scenario, and one player the alt art card, and one player nothing--- that's a really, really weird way to do this. Is that really what you store chose to do?

The kit had one mat, one promo, and then one large scenario deck. The deck is made up of 14 mini encounter sets, that you then pick seven to build your encounter deck. If you're going against another team, you pick seven for them and they pick seven from you, but from what I could tell they'd need a kit also as there's only a single 1A quest card, and one copy of a unique location that starts in play. The store had one kit per table, not per player.

The store left it up to the players how the kit was distributed at each table. If we played competitive then we could do 2v2 or something and split prizes that way. As my table was all strangers, even a 2v2 team would have left things hard to split. We decided at my table it would be most fair to role a dice and let high number pick first. Another table was a whole family so they had it easier, though that was an expensive kit for them!

Man, that is unfortunate.  So in the past a 'kit' typically supported 4 players, and included 4 mats, 4 copies of the scenario (and the promo art card is packed inside the scenario itself, so that's intended to be one product).  This year a 'kit' seems really only intended for 1 person, but it's advertised as supporting 4 players?  Weird.

This makes me worried about my fellowship event that's happening next month (europe, yay). I wouldn't pay 25$ if if meant not getting the quest or the mat. That's the main value for me.

## 10 [Bullroarer Took on October 14, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284509-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=3502965)

All 12 players at our event got the mat, the deck and the card.

I think you would be 100% justified asking for your money back if you didn't get all the materials.

Sounds like my store may have ran it wrong based on your comments. My cost was $20, but yeah I had expected to get at least something more than just admission for that.

Thanks for confirming! I was hoping someone who attended one this year would post, just the off chance that it really was different than last year.

Yeah I'm going to E-mail the owner tonight to confirm if how it was ran was what was intended when they were charging full price per person, but splitting up the kit between four people. They are a great store and I'm really lucky to be near them. This is the first event ever where I left feeling disappointed since I found the place so I'm sure this was just a fluke or misunderstanding between the players and the person who ran it or something I missed that I should have read before signing up.

That's odd, sorry to hear, @TheGuardian118 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/274633-theguardian118/]! My F (not quite local) GS got two kits, and there was a deck, playmat, and alt-art card for everyone (seven total). I think this year is like all past (non-epic multiplayer) Fellowship Events: four per kit.

## 14 [Kjeld on October 16, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284509-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=3504881)

I paid $15 for my local FGS Fellowship event (4th year in a row that I've gone to it), and each paying participant got a mat, encounter deck, and alt-art promo.

## 15 [crx3800 on October 18, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284509-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=3507563)

I think the real problem is the stores can have a significant effect on how these get handed out, too. Our store pretty much refused to get more than one kit even though we could name at least seven people that wanted to buy/participate in a share. He then wanted to charge at least double what he paid for it to let us get shares. The only reason they got divided the way they should was because we were making sure they got divided. All it would take is one guy who was just trying to cheat the system to say "I get two decks and three mats in one share!" 

 

It's not that LGS operators are stupid, it's that they simply can't keep up with the detail of every single product (or kit) they get. 

 

I'm not happy at all about the way these kits were released. My store barely knew about them in time to order one. He refused to order more than one due to the usual uncertainty of these things, and they sell out in less than a day. Leaving us with the ones on Ebay, and hopefully we're lucky enough to get one in our store.

Good to hear.
