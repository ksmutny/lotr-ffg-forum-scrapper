We've seen some of the symbols for the new encounter sets in Khazad-dum.  I'm having a hard time telling what they all are.  Does anyone have a better guess as to what the revealed icons depict?  Am I missing any other revealed icons or counts?

There are 9 new encounter sets:

Orc head symbol - 13 cards (Plundered Armory is card 12 of 13)

Torch symbol - 17 cards (Branching Paths is card 5 of 17)

Book symbol - 9 cards (Cave Troll is card 1 of 9)

Mining pick-axe symbol - 12 cards (Patrol Leader is card 1 of 12)

Orc with spear symbol - 13 cards (Goblin Tunnels is card 12 of 13)

Moon with tree outline? symbol - ?? cards

Map symbol (Flee Moria?) - ?? cards (Abandoned Tools is card 13? of 13 or 17?)  http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_public/img_illustrations_gallery/Kazam_1.png [http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_public/img_illustrations_gallery/Kazam_1.png]
 
other symbol - ?? cards

other symbol - ?? cards

It looks like we have only seen 7 of the 9 new icons.  If anyone knows of a Khazad-dum icon that I have not listed, please post the info and I'll update this post.

I am happy about getting so many new encounter cards, but I am most interested in any that might be from outside of Moria.  Perhaps the mountains or the Dimril Dale or Hollin?

The Book symbol could perhaps relate to the Book of Mazarbul?

The moon could be Doors Durin

The orc definatly looks like a Moria Goblin so im guessing lots of goblin cards that are fast to draw through (lots of surge?)

Those guesses look good.

Can anyone tell what the left-most icon on the "Search for the Chamber" card is?

And, is this a moon with the silhouette of a bare tree?

it sort of looks like two dwarves with one pointing at something, guessing in context as it is a search quest

 Updated with info from the article:

It looks like the icon on Goblin Tunnels is an orc with a spear.   Goblin Tunnels is card 12 of 13 in that encounter set.

The set # of a card has nothing to do with the quantity of that card included right?  Or am I wrong?  If a card is 5 of 17, does that mean there are only 17 cards in that set or 17 unique cards of varying quantities?  You guys get what I am asking here?  I am very, very curious about the size of these encounter sets given how much they are claiming to pack into only 165 total cards.

I assume they will do it the same as they did with Massing at Osgiliath.  That is, if a card is labeled "5 of 17," there could be another copy of the exact same card that labeled "6 of 17."  That is, there are only 17 total cards in the encounter set, including duplicates.

I found another spoiled encounter card (an Objective!) on the French board: 

http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=180&efcid=11&efidt=167027 [http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=180&efcid=11&efidt=167027]

I think this translates "Abandoned Tools"

Under the card title it gives a title for the adventure.  I think it translates "Flee Moria," which I'd guess is the 3rd and final adventure in the Khazad-Dum box.

I don't think I have seen that encounter icon before.  Is it a map?

Under the icon it gives the card number and total count of cards in the encounter set.  Is it 13 of 13?  Or 13 of 17?  I can't quite make it out.  Can anyone see it more clearly than I can?
