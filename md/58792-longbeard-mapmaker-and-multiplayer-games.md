 Can other players who have lore Heros in spend lore resources to give Longbeard +1 to the quest, or only the player controlling him?  Thanks in advance.

no.

There are no effects that can use discard from multipul players apart from eyowen's and that is not pumpable, only 1 card per player. The owner of teh card must pay the cost of the card, unless the card says otherwise
