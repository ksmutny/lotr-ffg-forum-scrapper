# [Can Book of Eldacar be used to play feint?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94455-can-book-of-eldacar-be-used-to-play-feint/)

I usually use "Book of Eldacar" card to play "Feint" from my discard pile. I also use "Book of Earnil" to play "A Test of Will". Many people also propose these combinations for decks.

 

But today I read again (more carefully) the card. To play an event from your discard pile, you must use an action. But cards like "Feint" and "A Test of Will" are responses. You do not play them during an action window but as a response to something. I am starting to believe that the way these book cards are written, using them with events that are responses is wrong.

 

What say you?

Feint is not a response.

You are right otherwise.

My mistake!

 

For some silly reason I remembered it being a response ...

So for "A Test of Will" it is not possible to be combined with "Book of Earnil"

 

Thanks for the answer!
