A couple of questions about Hidden Cache:

1) Do you get the 2 resource bonus when you use King Under the Mountain to discard it?  I assume so, but I could be convinced otherwise.

 

2) I did a blind Vilya attempt and happened to hit Hidden Cache.  It's clearly not discarded, so I can't get the two resources.  But, do I get to draw a card for free or do I still have to pay one resource?  It's a "0 cost" card, but the action has a "cost".  How does "play for no cost" come into play here?

1) As the wording on King Under the Mountain is to discard the other card, you get the two resources.

 

2) I think that you have to pay the cost within the action as it is part of the action keyword, but would get to ignore the cost of the card itself (so in this case, 1 resource for 1 card). Which is a shame.

maybe THAT is why they worded it that way... no Vilya resource engine.  Although you'd have to be able to repeat it for that to be a concern...

Hmm, the King Under the Mountain/Hidden Cache is an interesting one that I hadn't considered. King simply says to "look" at the cards, meaning the Cache would still be in your deck when you discard it. Sounds valid to me.

Hi guys,

I just got a copy of hidden cache and wondered how that response action works:

 

I guess it doesnt trigger, when I just discard it from my hand like playing other cards. Is that right? It would be too easy.

 

So when does "discarding" happen (except with king under the mountain)? I cant find that many options and still it´s quite a gambling to put that card into your deck, isnt it?

You are correct, it only triggers if the card is discarded from your deck. If it's in your hand you're pretty much limited to the action - one resource to draw one card.

 

King Under the Mountain can be a pretty good option for Hidden Cache by itself, since you can trigger it every round. It can also work with A Very Good Tale, Zigil Miner, Ered-Nimrais Prospector, Expert Treasure-hunter and Longbeard Sentry, off the top of my head. There might be a couple of others I've forgotten.
