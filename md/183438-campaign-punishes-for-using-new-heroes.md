Just been looking at the campaign rules as I'll be starting the Black Riders soon. For the most part it looks really good and can't wait to start. 

 

However, one rule that seems a bit harsh is gaining a permanent threat increase for taking a different hero. I sort of get this thematically to keep the original party, but when doing so because a hero has fallen, it seems like an extra punishment on top of actually losing the hero. Worse though, is that when I buy a new expansion (particularly a Saga one), I'm also punished for using any new heroes I've just bought (i.e. it discourages using new heroes gained from purchasing FFG's products).

 

Does anyone else find this to be an odd ruling? I'll probably ignore it TBH, especially if I'm using a newly purchased hero. Just wanted to hear what others think about this.

There are several points during the campaign where you can change your heroes without a threat penalty. So I don't see this as an issue. If anything, I would argue that this rule provides a reasonable incentive to replay the campaign from the beginning. If you do not like it, you can just play each saga scenarios without campaign rules. Well, actually you don't have to follow any rules at all if you just play this by yourself. :-)

Yeh, if you want to just swap heroes around you don't have to play in campaign mode. If you do play in campaign mode, there are points during the campaign at which you're allowed to change your hero lineup without taking the penalty (which I suspect were included specifically so players could incorporate the new heroes releaased in the new saga boxes as they came out).

Ah, I wasn't aware of that. That pretty much addresses my main concern, thanks for the heads up :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  So, can I assume one of these points is before the first Road Darkens quest?

The first one is during the preparation for the first quest of The Road Darkens. Fits quite well too, as you are in Rivendell and probably meet a few new possible companions there. :-)

I usually start my Saga Campaign again when I make hero changes. I really enjoy the saga quests including the earlier ones so replaying it from the start is fun.
