We were playing The Breaking of the Fellowship, an uruk Hai Hunter turned up: 

Peril.   Toughness 1.  

When Revealed: Either choose a player to reveal an additional encounter card, or Uruk-hai Hunter makes an immediate attack against you
 
we were not sure if the player choose to have the attack that another player could defend for him.  The first step of an attack is deal it a shadow card, at that point are you still in Peril? And therefor cannot recieve help?  
Or, since the attack has now begun, you are no longer resolving the 'When Revealed' effect and therefore you can recieve help.
thanks!

You can get help by sentinal defenses for this attack. Peril for this card is related to the decision you have to make by the When Revealed effect. So you and you alone have to choose if you want the additional encounter card of the immediate attack.
