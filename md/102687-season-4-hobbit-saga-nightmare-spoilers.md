Who needs my gratitude? 

I think if they'd wanted dat gratitude so much, they'd spoiled everything at once as soon as they got the chance.

Dude, it's internet. If you're not ready to meet someone who's opinion is different from yours - don't visit the internet. And please, don't tell me what to do, I'll figure it out on my own.

I thought that Khazad Dum would be first.

 

But anyway, welcome! I wish try it....mmmmmh!

 

I have just tried Hunt for Gollum Nightmare..., and it is really hard alone. True. Only i have won in the 7th time, and only with only one of my best decks.   uks.  I dont want to see the new nightmare packs :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png] !!!

It's funny how I was just a little sad about having to wait to see the whole spoiler list and you appear here, starting accusing me in ***** and now I am a troll all of the sudden. I think it can be called something like "self-trolled".

I got my set a few days ago so I can spoil it when I get the chance, but I don't want to steal anyone's thunder though haha.

Yeesh, why did I get drug into this? I'll freely admit that a year ago I didn't handle criticism from you very well, but in general, most people tend to do this thing where, oh, I dunno, they eventually grow and mature over time, ya know? I'm entirely prepared for internet flaming nowadays, be it warranted and reasonable or not, so... not sure what else to say, really.
