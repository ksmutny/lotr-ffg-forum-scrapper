 Just beat JtR with a deck that has absolutely no duplicates of any cards in it.  Had to go tri-sphere, otherwise there wasn't 50 cards I wanted in my deck.  I found it extremely gratifying to play with all cards being unique.  Of course, makes it a lot harder to get the best cards.  Here's what I played:

 

Heroes: Glorfindel, Legolas, Frodo

 

Allys (18):  Gandalf, Radagast, miner of iron hills, Escort from Edoras, Gleowine, Veteran Axehand, Wandering Took, Westfold Horse Breaker, Daughter of Nimrodel, Longbeard Mapmaker, Eomund, Winged Guardian, Haldir, Landroval, Horseback Archer, Henamarth, Erebor Hammersmith, gondorian spearman

 

Attachments(13): Song of Wisdom, Dwarven Axe, Citadel Plate, forest snare, burning brand, mathom, blade of gondolin, dark knowledge, protector of lorien, unexpected courage, horn of gondor, self preservation, favor of the lady

 

Event(16): Swift strike, rain of arrows, radagast's cunning, blade mastery, beorn's hospitality, lore of imladris, quick strike, secret paths, strider's path, hasty stroke, fortune or fate, feint, a test of will, will of the west, loriens wealth, galadhrims greeting,

Just nitpicking, but since the Heroes are not part of your deck you should have included three more cards.

 

Well done on beating Rhosgobel though, especially with just one Lore of Imladris. I'm suitably impressed!

 I have also wondered how a deck with no duplicates would perform. Thanks for posting this here. Cool concept and certainly for the more talented player. I can't think of building a deck without my 3 Gandalfs! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I call it a fail, you only have 47 cards Frayed.  Add 3 more cards and try again partido_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/partido_risa.gif]

Pretty good considering no Leadership...

nice, I have been playing a "singleton"deck as well for fun, but not had much luck with it.. would be interested to see your card list.

## 7 [Frayed on October 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54185-deck-with-no-duplicates/?do=findComment&comment=537315)

 Yes, yes, whatever! Just added infighting, lorien guide, rivendell minstrel.

The one issue I would have with a deck like this is the possibility of a great deal of inconsistency, due to so many different cards. I've never been a fan of having 1X cards in a 50 card deck. That was the main reason I got a second Core Set. But if it works for you, then great.

 For me, that's the whole point; the inconsistency.  Never guaranteed at least one gandalf or dunedain attachment.  Don't find yourself saying: man I haven't drawn a gandalf yet, I KNOW one is coming soon.  Of course I also play decks with multiples.  It's just fun to switch it up and try different things.

I always played CoC Highlander-style and I thought it fitted the game...

With LotR it also goes well with the overall theme of the game... Especially since some of the attachments or characters are unique anyway.

I applaud your attempt of building such a deck. Seems like it has been working for you. Maybe I'll try something like this as well... But I'll probably wait until the card pool has gotten bigger... Of course: Consistency is going to be a problem. But on the other hand: Maybe it will provide us with some new challenges! (And aren't challenges the thing that keeps this game alive?)

"Highlander" is a common term for any deck with only one copy of each card.

This could a a way of makin "old" quest usefull allso in fure, by making more diverse decks. I personally allways has liked higlander decks. They are mostly har to play, but game experience is very diverse :-)

Bloody brilliant.  I am definitely going to try a Highlander deck of my own.
