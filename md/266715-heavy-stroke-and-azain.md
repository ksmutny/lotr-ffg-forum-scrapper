Azain Silverbeard:

Can the damage dealt by Azain's Response be doubled via Heavy Stroke? I'm inclined to say no, but I am curious to see what others think.

The question would be whether the damage dealt by Azain's response is actually dealt by Azain.  My guess would be that his direct damage, and all other direct damage effects (e.g. Thalin, Gandalf, Argalad, Farmer Maggot) is dealt by the player, not the character.

Agreed, Heavy Stroke wouldn't work here.
