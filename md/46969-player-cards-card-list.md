# [Player Cards - Card List ?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46969-player-cards-card-list/)

Hi, I am trying to check my components, but I do not know how many Player Cards are available. The "Core Set Encounter List" already told me about Encounter Cards, there are the 12 Heroes (none repeated), and the 10 double sided Quest cards.

 

Can anyone post the quantity of player cards ? Can be something like #73 x 2 (for 2 Gandalf for example)

 

Thanks in advance

 that's a bit of work :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] and who likes to work :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])) well, as long as you have 30 cards for each sphere, i.e. without the heroes, but gandalf inculded, you should be able to make that list yourself...sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif]

In fact, the problem is, for example Leadership deck. There are 15 different cards, but I do not know how many Guard of Citadels come, or how many Celebrian Stones. I understood that the number of each card is fixed in each box (I am new on Living Card Game concept), but I cannot find how many of each card.

The link that I gave you tells you the quantity per card in the box when you search in the Lord of the Rings card game section.
