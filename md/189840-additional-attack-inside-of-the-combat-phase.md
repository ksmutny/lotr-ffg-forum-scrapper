Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase

If an enemy attacks outside of the combat phase, it is

still dealt a shadow card at the beginning of the attack.

Then follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 “Combat” in the

rules. Any shadow cards dealt to the attacking enemy

are discarded after the attack resolves.

 

But what happens when an enemy makes an additional attack during the step 3 of the combat phase? I must deal a new shadow card? 

 

example: Shadow: If it is Night, attacking enemy makes an additional attack after this one.

Yeah, that's in the FAQ as well: 

 

(1.42) Additional attacks by an enemy When an enemy makes an additional attack, discard all of its previously dealt shadow cards before dealing it a new shadow card.
