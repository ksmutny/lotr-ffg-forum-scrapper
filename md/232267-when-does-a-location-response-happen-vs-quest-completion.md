# [When does a location Response happen vs quest completion?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232267-when-does-a-location-response-happen-vs-quest-completion/)

During the Resolve quest portion of the quest phase, I may generate enough progress to clear both the current location and the current quest. 
 
It appears those tokens are all placed in what is pretty much one indivisible chunk, as a result the location is explored and the quest is advanced.
 
My question is: when do Forced and/or regular Responses to the location being explored go off, relative to the quest being advanced?
Is there a time between the location-explored and quest-advanced, when those response are suppose to trigger.
Or, are location-explored and quest-advanced both something that happens inside the one framework action, and Responses to either waits until they are both done?
 
I have always done the location responses prior to handling the quest, but both location-explored and quest-advanced seem "immediate" on the sufficient progress tokens being placed, and are possibly happening at passive effect speed, suggesting to me that location-departure-responses happen after the quest-advancement. Have i been doing it wrong - in those rare cases it matters?

This has been clarified by the developers.  I believe it is in the most recent FAQ, but couldn't seem to find it in there for a citation.  I found it.

Quest advancement (and any When Revealed effects as a result of advancing) happens before resolving any Responses/Forced effects as a result of the location being explored.

I think that this clarification is strange, because we always place tokens on the active location before the quest card.

I believe the idea is that you place all tokens as one motion.  The location takes tokens before the quest, but the tokens all hit at once.

After the tokens hit, the quest resolution takes top priority above anything else for all of it's text before any other forced / response resolve.

 

This makes sense to me only because the quest is it's own card type, and all of it's effects are top priority for the game.
