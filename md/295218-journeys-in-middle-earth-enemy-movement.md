Hi, guys,

I'm not very sure how you actually handle enemy movement when an enemy band is already in a space with a hero in it. Let's say, for example, that a band of orcs is in a space with Gimli and the app instructs them to move "Move 1 and attack Legolas", and let's say that Legolas is 1 space away. Do orcs leave Gimli's space to attack Legolas, or are they pinned by Gimli and remain in combat with him?

From what I can read in Learn to Play and Reference guide, it seems that they have to leave Gimli Space and attack Legolas, but as this is a bit counterintuitive compared to other similar board games and I would like to be sure....

Hi! I'm enjoying Journeys myself, and I bet a lot of people here are too, butÂ I think you'll probably get more response in the dedicated Journeys forum:

(It's pretty active.)

Yes. Orc leave the Gimlis space. The named gero is the Main target. The nearest, if the Main target is not available.
