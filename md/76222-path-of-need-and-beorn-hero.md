I was playing Into Ithilien yesterday and i played Path of Need on a location so i had a doubt. Could Beorn quest without exhausting or his inmune to player card effects prevents it?

Beorn has 0 willpower, and it cannot be raised due to the fact he's immune to card effects, so it's kind of a moot point. To answer your question though, I would say no he cannot, as path of need is a player card and he's immune to their effects. Beorn can get kinda tricky sometimes. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
