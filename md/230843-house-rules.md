Anyone have their own house rules?

 

 

Here's one of mine:

 

Instead of "cannot have attachments" on Bill the Pony, it now says "cannot have attachments other than Titles"

 

 

In otherwords.

Yep. It just got real.

House ruling on a coop/solo game feels like cheating to me :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]  However, if you enjoy it then go for it. I only play this game solo, and I'm very strict with the rules - if I win a game, then realise I got a rule/ability wrong, I'll count that game as a loss and replay the scenario, but that's just me.

Do you want him to be the Steward of Gondor, Heir of Mardil, Protector of Lórien, Lord of Morthond, Warden of Arnor and Elf-friend who is Not a Stranger and In Service of the Steward?

i don't house rule too much, but i do like deck build particular themes instead of just throwing in a bunch of powerful cards for crazy combo potential

I'd like to add 1 rule in some teams:

 

- After everybody has commited their characters, if the controller of Théodred haven't add resource to nobody, the first (being a valid objective) in say it, is who gets the resource.

- Before the end of the refresh phase, if controller of Galadriel hero has Gala ready and doesn't say nothing, the first in tell it is who gets the effects of the Gala's ability.

 

Is it fair? ^^ I think so!

I house-rule spirit Pippin's ability to be non-dependant on having à full Hobbit héro line-up. He's already as bad as he is!
