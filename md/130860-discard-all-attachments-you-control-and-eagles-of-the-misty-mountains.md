Was just wondering: when prompted to discard all attachments I control, I know you exclude attachments that have been placed on you by treachery cards or enemies, but one particular instance confused me a little. Do the discarded eagles that are attached to Eagles of the Misty Mountains count as attachments you control? Would they be discarded if instructed to discard all attachments I control?

This is from the FAQ:

 

"Any non-objective card that attaches to another card loses its original card type and gains the attachment card type."

 

So those facedown Eagles count as attachments and can be discarded by card effects targeting attachments.

I thought that'd be the case, I just wasn't sure if these were attatchments I controlled. The more I think about it though the more I ask myself why wouldn't they be though. Thanks!
