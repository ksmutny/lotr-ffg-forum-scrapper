I know we've got another cycle already announced, and the second Hobbit box too, so I'm not suggesting that the game is drying up or anything like that… but like lots of people I have noticed that the amount of news and previews is drying up.

August actually had the lowest number of news items since before the game was launched (with just 3 items). And then September came along and beat the record -- because that month only had 2 items.

Even the French site is getting more news than us, because apparently they've had some stuff about the new cycle ages ago, which we haven't got on ours yet.

I really miss the news, because it gives the people on this forum (and BGG too) something to talk about. We can't speculate on much anymore, other than the few cards that we've known about for ages.

I think FFG are missing a trick by drying up the news, especially when there's some new boxes in the pipeline, because it keeps the interest up. maybe they spoiled us in the past, and this is the normal amount that we should expect. Maybe we should compare how much news we get with what the other games go. I'm pretty sure that older games like Call of Cthulu and Game of Thrones get loads more

 

[PS… last time i asked about the news they posted a load more straight away about the new cycle, so im hoping that im going to jinx them into doing that again!]

i dont think it means anything- ive watched the news waver and steady since the game came out last year. i think they just have alot of things to do and not many people to do it

i do think news is important though- as you say it gets people here…..i mean the news of the numenor (the battles one) got hardly any talk going, compared to the khazad and so on which talk went of for ages

still its annoying, as i put so much time and love into this game- actually last time i started pretending to cry a preview came up …..so here it is

It is better not to compare with the other games, unless one is ready to get angry, it is often hard to find a preview for this game on the news list. I too think previews are the spice but the topic has been rather over-argumented in the past.

I've been to Edge's site and haven't seen any of the previews the choppic, et al. have been posting, give me a link somebody, or at least what website they are talking about.

I'm not too worried about it (and I am playing catch-up with the cycles, so I'm happy for them to take their time). rich is right when he said that many of the spoiled mechanics have gotten little talk. I think we're averaging (unscientifically) 5-15 replies per spoiled keyword. Archery got very little talk. Battlegrounds and Siege also were largely ignored. In my recent update of the (SPOILERS) thread I've added all of the text to the known cards, with some inferred phrases as well. One surprise for me in that exercise was seeing all of the new keywords and card interactions. For example. If you explore The Citadel, an 11 point Battleground location soon enough, you remove a stage 4 from the quest deck. That's so cool and yet I haven't read anyone commenting on it. Then there's the whole Battleground mechanic where enemies damage locations and if the locations are destroyed you can't explore them or claim the victory points. I also saw on stage 2B of Siege of Cair Andros that there might be a new "sieging" stage in each round (for certain quests). Now that was very small print in an out of focus, digital photograph, but if that is actually the case, the designers have added a whole new stage to each round. That's HUGE (IMHO).

So my point is a lot is going on already, and we are basically ignoring it. I'm certainly to blame as my schedule has picked up so I'm posting less, and maybe we all just want more big and clear pictures of spoiled cards and mini-commentaries from Caleb. I imagine as October drags on we'll get some previews of The Hobbit II and HoN. Apparently Christian Petersen said the one will be out 1 month and a half or so after the other, so if they both hit this year, one must be out by mid-November at the latest (barring shipping problems).

On a semi-related topic, I think Heirs of Numenor must include some additional tokens (or maybe stickers a la choppic) since we need to keep track of damage on locations now, and so many quest stages/locations are over 10 points.

 I think this mostly has to do with FFG launching 2 new games in the second half of this year.

 C'mon folks, we knew months ago it was going to be short commons between the two Hobbit boxes.  FFG has to limit their teasing or we'll go mad.

The "Siege" picture you mentioned, rich, absolutely stunning! It drew the following comment, which I found hilarious:

           Why doesn't the castle look like Helms Deep? The battle is very obviously the Battle of Helms Deep but the castle looks different.

All I could think was, "Really? Was Helm's Deep in the middle of a big river? Did it have a huge bridge that spanned a river to get inside the deeping wall? Folks, just because you see siege ladders, orcs, and a big fight in the middle of a rainy night doesn't make the Siege of Cair Andros the battle of Helm's Deep. What a loon. (I'm only venting here because I don't have/want a deviantArt account).

If you like Gizli. Those folks really ought to ID their scenes before they say stupid stuff like that. (In his defense, that scene is only in the book by report, there are no first hand accounts).

Hilarious video GS. Maybe my post was a little sarcastically rude, but assuming that any time theirs a siege ladder on a wall makes a battle Helm's Deep is ridiculous. Now the guy is trying to suggest that Lorien elves were at Helm's Deep.

It did seem to me also the other must be Leadership Faramir. However, with 8 heroes available in the deluxe plus the aps, we are bound to get second copies of Boromir and Denethor, no? Even though Boromir's Tactics version is indeed superb from all points of view, except there are almost no synergies as of yet - but they are surely coming in HoN and AtS.

crap, i forgot about the APs for a moment, good call. so yes, plenty of room i guess. denethor must come (just for a non-creepy version of the art) and id also like to see the palantir as an attatchment and lots of nice weapons from the gondor armouries.

Interesting will be the sphere alignment. Because the whole family fits Leadership, Faramir is already and might be again in the hero version and both Denethor and Boromir were great leaders. Denethor fits Lore perfectly also, so if he's to be an ally this time round, he can remain lore, though the last ruling steward of Gondor would call for being Leadership. And Boromir, could be something wicked like Spirit… surely not Lore.

I don't know why everyone is assuming Boromir, as he hasn't been spoiled and all that anyone on the French board (thanks for pointing this out btw.) is saying is supposition/hypothesizing. Also as to heroes in the Numenor cycle, I wouldn't bet on all Gondor folks (remember what happened in DD that wasn't anything close to all dwarves. In any case, I'm sure we'll see new versions of all of the "Steward" family, either in Ally or Hero form, and then maybe some hobbiti for rich (the Latin pl. of hobbitus is there in case anyone didn't know that an official Latin translation of The Hobbit has finally been published).

Well I guess that it makes sense he would (and not Faramir) since he is the heir to the stewardship (and not Faramir), but if we don't get a Faramir hero I'll be very upset (and probably not just me, but others too). Also it would be nice if the designers would release the info in English/American sources before third party/language adaptations did, since it's designed by an American company, but I digress.

The designer had confirmed we were getting Faramir hero a long ago, no worries. At the same interview Spirit (or Tactics) Glorfindel was mentioned.

But for now, the let the wild speculations of Boromir begin? Leadership? Same stats? Would be cool if he quested a bit more, we don't really need another killer. But if Leadership, he might rather get resources or stuff. Perhaps get as strong as the resources in his pool? The guy on the French forum said the Pelargir girl combos well with him, so?

im not sure, but it should be something that shows his proud belief in gondor, perhaps have a very powerful effect with a risk of a downside
