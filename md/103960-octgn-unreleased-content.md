Here I made a little set of things that was spoiled in previews for those who are keen to try it out but too lazy to create this set themselves. 

 

To install, just copy the kinky named "fb67c792-ecb9-4f06-b462-625ba22dfb2a" folder into the Documents\OCTGN\GameDatabase\a21af4e8-be4b-4cda-a6b6-534f9717391f\Sets.

This set currently contains:

Heroes:

Celeborn

 

Allies:

Bilbo Baggins

Elrond

Gwaihir

Naith Guide

 

Attachments:

Captain of Gondor

Fellowship of the Ring

Leaf Brooch

Wingfoot

 

Events:

Follow Me!

Noiseless Movement

The Tree People

 

 

I'll be updating it as more suitable cards spoiled.
