Does anyone have suggestions for a strong solo deck (I don't have Dread Realm so no Arwen hero if possible).

Which Glorfindel would I use In the Boromir Galadriel deck

The blue one.

 

I have a lot of success with Boromir(tactics), Glorifindel(spirit) & Aragorn(lore).

I haven't played solo in awhile, but I really liked an Elrohir, Elledan, Eowyn deck I had made.  I wasn't playing it against nightmare quests or anything, but it had good success. The Boromir deck mentioned above seems like an absolute beast though.  I'd recommend trying that one out.  You can find a list here [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/42/seastan-s-boromir-1.0].

Most Boromir decks work wonders against most quests,  usually with Glorfindel. Third hero is more flexibel for example: Galadriel or Loragorn.

Seastan's Dunadain Trappers deck is great in solo, too (beats Carn Dum consistantly and that's one of the hardest quests).

A personal favorite of mine is mono leadership with mostly Gondor and Leadership Boromir.

Dwarf and Outland swarms work against most quests too.

 

For Powerplay I would use one of the first two decks.

I wouldn't mind seeing your siblings deck Sloth.

It seems I don't have a saved deck list anymore for it.  and it was in dire need of updating anyways.  let me see what I can come up with.

I've posted it to the new deckbuilder.  Siblings Unite.  It is a modified version of what I'd used previously.   I don't think it's any Boromir beater, but it was fun to play.

Thanks.  I'll take a look.

I looked at it.  You surprised me with adding Outlands and putting the Horn on Arwen was a good idea too.

getting 12 WP for 6 resources is too hard to pass up (assuming you only have the 3 spirit guys).  Add in the others and all your stats are good - though things that do a single dmg to everything will destroy them.  You could even put in Gondorian Fire to put on Elledan to have him help kill anything that is real big.

My go to is the deck I call The 3 Ring Circus. Gandalf/Elrond/Galadriel. Starting threat is high but I've beaten every quest up to the newest box with it. Usually with a low number of attempts. It obviously incorporates a number of "OP" elements but I find it hugely enjoyable.
