The title says it all.

How many times do you play the same quest after you have beat it? Any comments to make the replay more fun?

Do you mean right away? i.e., how many times in a row?

 

I primarily play multiplayer, and with so many quests out now, we pretty much beat a quest and move on to something new. I don't think I ever play the same quest twice in a row - unless we lose.

 

Now, that's not to say that we don't replay quests - of course we do (there are only so many) but we vary it up. We tend to play from different cycles every time we get together. And almost always have different decks built when we meet up.

Context: Solo players, running two hands.  I used to track score, but don't anymore so no need to "get best score".

 

Short answer: usually at least one more time.  This is to make sure that the victory wasn't a lucky fluke.  

 

Longer answer: Depends on circumstances.  For example

 * it's a killer quest and I'm happy to have finally beat it. In this case, I'm happy to move on.
 * I realize I made a mistake and so the victory may not have been honest. Then I'll play until I win w/out mistakes.
 * There's a goal I want to achieve such as treasures...

 

Of course, all of this is relative to the particular heroes I'm using. If I throw together new decks, then prior victories don't count.

Hunt Gollum Nightmare is really hard. 7 times to win it. And with one of my best decks...!

Haha...not to rain on your parade...but this is generally considered one of the "easier" nightmare decks! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Mostly until I win (solo) against the Quest.

 

Some more often, because of deck building.

 

Mainly I played all the quest around 4 - 8 times. Passage through Mirkwood about 60 times - to learn the game and the strength of the different spheres. And Anduin also about 60 times (deck building against the quest).

So after you beat the quest solo - you never play it again?

First I play it until I beat it. Then I play it again to reduce my score. When I design a new deck I tend to play it against all existing quests again. From Into Fangorn (3 times) to Into Ithilien (~200 times)... ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] but most quests I've played about 20-30 times

Thanks!

I play in a grp of 3. To me I started asking myself are the small packs worth it? Like $15 for a quest I'll play once?

Wondered how others felt about that. I'm thinking of coming up with a random quest generator that could use all the cards I own.

In the moment there is so much new stuff, that I play a Quest again is that I play that quest with more players - or to test a new Deck. I played all Quests until the first Dwarrowdelf Quest.

When a new quest comes out i'll normally play it half a dozen times or so with a few different decks.  I'll occasionally go back and play one specific quest or if i have a lot of time to play i'll try and plow through a whole cycle or the 3 quests of an expansion

I have no hard and fast rules on this, but generally I'll replay a quest as long as I still enjoy it. Most of the Mirkwood quests are among my favourites, so I've played them a fair bit, but the Dwarrowdelf ones aren't, so I've only played them once or twice. I'm not the sort of person who plays relentlessly until he wins, many times I've "lost" a quest but have put it all away and, usually, enjoyed myself. I currently own everything for this game, and I don't think there is any quest that I feel is "done", or whatever. Depending on my mood, I might not tackle one quest for months (or years), but another I might come back to regularly. There are a lot that I have only played once, and there are a lot that I have played many times. That's no real indication of the enjoyment I got from the quest, either: Shadow & Flame was one of my least enjoyable experiences with this game, and Steward's Fear was one of my greatest, and yet I've only played each of these once. 

 

I see the adventure packs as expansions in the boardgame sense, rather than booster packs of the card game variety, so ignoring the issues of price, the questions is like asking "how many times do you play Dunwich Horror?" or whatever. Just because you complete a scenario, does that mean you should never play it again? If you defeated Shudde M'ell, would you never play Dunwich Horror again? Well, possibly. My point is, no matter how many times I've gone through the Hills of Emyn Muil, I never grow tired of it, but I don't play to win, I only play to enjoy myself. Of course, some people enjoy themselves by winning, but I'm in this game for the lore, the sense of epic that it manages to capture. Against that, winning is pretty immaterial. 

 

And that was a pretty long and drawn-out post...!

I also play in a group of 3, and we (try to) get together once a week.

I almost never play solo. It's way less fun IMO; to me this is a social game.

So to answer you question, we play every quest until we beat it, and we select any quest we want to do afterwards, as we don't get much play time. Favorites are: massing, FoS, CatC, 7th lvl, WitW & recently, AoO.

All great multi-player quests. (Edit: meaning quests that are you money's worth in MP)

I totally agree and play the same way. Invariably I have usually made a mistake that needs correcting.

I like to okay blind versus the encounter deck so I usually change the deck th second time based on what I see etc. like to have 2 soild wins before I move on.

Exception are the hobbit quests. I just got so bored of dwarves by then that I stopped after I beat the last quest and banished dwarves to the binder

I record win or loss for every game I play in a spreadsheet.

I played Dead Marshes solo only 6 times, and I've played Road to Rivendell 53 times solo. Those are my extremes.
Average is probably 10.

10+ for the GenCon PODs

3-5 for the Deluxe and Saga

1-2 for the Circle packs

I generally have some of the earlier (easier) quests always set up to try my new decks out against. They are nostalgic to play against, and I simply love the Mines of Moria Delux Expansion. It's essentially three "dungeon delving" quests. I tend to play "Into the Mines" the most, of all of the quests in the game.

I love anduin and massingosgiliath to test new decks

I don't have all the expansions yet, but so far I like to use Passage through Mirkwood or Anduin as proof of concept quests for new decks, and in particular play Passage whenever I am introducing someone to the game. I feel like killing spiders is hazing that all players should experience!

 

I also particularly enjoy both Conflict at the Carrock and We Must Away Ere Break of Day from the first Hobbit. Something about fighting several big Trolls while dealing with the potential mess of getting sacked is always fun, though neither quest is that hard when you control your threat/pacing (or throw lots of dwarves at it!). I'll look forward to playing the Nightmare modes of these once I fill out my collection.
