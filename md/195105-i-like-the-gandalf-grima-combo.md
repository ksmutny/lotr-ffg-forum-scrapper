Made a fun deck with those two. Kicked some Nightmare Mirkwood ass. Has trouble defending big guys, though, but I'll see what I can do.

 

By the way, it's a funny alternate universe setup, where Grima is not Saruman's, nut Gandalf's councelor :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Present them.

 

(share a decklist?)

It's not much, I've made it pretty quick after all and didn't even refined it, but it proved itself pretty capable during 3 consecutive Nightmare Mirkwood sessions (losing only 1 of them due to Ungoliant's Spawn showing up on turn 2 and wiping my board :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]). 

 

Heroes: Gandalf, Grima, Splorfindel (yeah... :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])

 

Allies(21):

Henamarth Riversong x1

Arwen x1

Bilbo x1

Damrod x1

Elfhelm x1

Anborn x1

Isengard Messenger x2

Saruman x2

Northern Tracker x2

Envoy of Pelargir x3

Galadriel's Handmaiden x3

Ithilien Lookout x3

 

Attachments(16):

Wizard's Pipe x1

Unexpected Courage x1

Keys of Orthanc x2

Light of Valinor x2

Gandalf's Staff x2

Asfaloth x2

Expert Treasure-hunter x3

Lembas x3

 

Events(13):

Hidden Cache x2

A Test of Will x2

Daeron's Runes x3

Elrond's Counsel x3

Flame of Anor x3

 

 

The main thing here is that Grima can reduce the cost of the top card of the deck for Gandalf.

Gimli? You might want to correct that. Otherwise, interesting deck! Never used that combnation before.

Yeah, thanks for correction, don't know how Gimli ended up there :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

It seems he was so eager to see some play he imprinted himself into the deck while I was looking the other way :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Fun fact: With right setup, Galadriel's Handmaiden can be played for "free". I usually give Keys of Orthanc to Splorfindel, so here is what happens: 

I activate Grima's ability -> I spend 1 resource from Splorfindel to pay for Galadriel's Handmaiden -> She enters play, triggers Doomed 1 and reduces my threat by 1 via her response -> I trigger Keys of Orthanc on Splorfindel, returning him dat 1 resource he just spent. As a result, I'm at the same threat level and amount resources I was before I played her :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Am I crazy, or would an O Lorien somewhere on the board actually net you a profit with this setup?

When you say Nightmare Mirkwood I assume you mean Return to Mirkwood? If so, did you play the quest solo? I find it hard to believe you could beat one of the most threatening quests with a Grima deck, but if you did, kudos!

Me? Definitely. But the other player would have to suffer the 1 threat from Doomed... :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

Gizlivadi, I meant Passage Through Mirkwood. I don't own Nightmare for the Return to Mirkwood, but I'll try the regular one just for the kicks :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

After a couple more playthroughs I realized Wandering Ents do not quite fit into the "aggro" style of the deck, and Pipe is not that important to warrant double Bilbo slot, so:

 

Bilbo x1, Wandering Ent x3 are removed from the deck;

 

Henamarth Riversong x1, Anborn x1, Isengard Messenger x2 are added to the deck.
