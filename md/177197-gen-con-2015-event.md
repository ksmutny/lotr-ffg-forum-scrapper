I was finally able to get into a LotR event after three years of trying. I really don't understand why there are so few spot available for this wonderful game. While I am very excited about finally getting to play in an event. I was not able to get into the Thursday event with my regular play partner. That's where I am hoping to find some help! I have a ticket for a spot in the Friday 7pm event. If anyone that is holding a ticket for the Thursday event would be willing to swap I would be very appreciative. If anyone can help me out just send me a message an we can work out the details. Thanks!

I can't help out, but I hope you find someone willing to trade. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
