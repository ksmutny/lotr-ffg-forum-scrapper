 Um, sorry if this is a dumb question, but just played my first multi-player game and wondered, for the hero Glorfindel, when it says he can heal 1 damage on any character, that's any character from any player right?

 Yep, any character means any hero or ally in play, under the control of any player.

Explains why with 2 players we were able to very easily beat the first scenario!

This game is awesome gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]
