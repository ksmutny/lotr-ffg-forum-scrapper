Hello guys,

 

Yesterday, I played a game with 5 players. I t was really fun!

 

The only problem, it was a bit long.

 

Of course, there is multiples senarios were you cannot play with more than 4 players because of specifics rules.

 

An other point is that you need a big encounter deck If you don't want to cycle trough it every turn.

 

So, the aim of this topic:

 

Does somody tried this before?

 

And would you try it?

Well, I don't see any problems with 5 players aside from keeping track of a buttload of information and running over encounter deck in a few turns (two sleeping sentries in one turn anybody?) :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You won't find sleeping sentry in into the pit.

It's part of the road to rivendell pack.

Did I said that you'll find it in into the pit? I was talking about 5 player games in general.
