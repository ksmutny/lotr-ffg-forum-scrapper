I wanted to share this with everyone, its a tryout for me so it could be for you too!

My choice of heros n spheres for the next scenario...

Aragorn with 2 heros from any other sphere(Im gonna try Spirit for 1st try; Eowyn n Eleanor). Im having absolutely NO Leadership cards excexpt for 'Parting gifts' n 'Common cause' (they both cost 0). Optionally I'll include a few 'signal' cards and of course 'Celebrians stone' is a good addition with Aragorn.

The rest of the deck only includes Spirit cards with 2 add-ons.

So obviously the question is 'What am I gonna do with all the resources Aragorn gains???' Good question gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Answer is simple, use Aragorn's special ability; Your likely to use it every turn and it costs a resource from his resource pile. Therefore, you might not even have some Leadership resources available since your gonna use it for his skill. And that means you can concentrate your other resources to ALL your cards.

Here is a workable solution that I will include in the drawing of cards to add more Spirit resources for your Heroes. Remember the part where I said 'Spirit cards with 2 add-ons' gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] Im putting in 2 'Song of travel'(Hero gains Spirit resource). Once a song is drawn, use it on Aragorn. That will give Spirit resource tokens to his pool; VOILA!

And of course on top of that add a few 'Gandalf' cards as well.

There is also another hero which you can do the trick... Glorfindel of the Lore sphere. There is a minor drawback with that hero; your probably not gonna need to use the special ability every turn(The special ability is to heal a character but limited to once a round). Still, there's always the 'song' cards that can help with gaining different sphere resources. To be seen with that hero!

Until then, Dont let the darkness get your Ring PLZ lol. Peace cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]

Looks like a fun deck idea!  A few things:

You don't need the Song on Aragorn if you already have Celebrian's stone - that gives him a spirit icon as well.

You need a leadership hero to play even 0-cost leadership cards.

You're aware that giving someone a spirit icon does not provide them with extra resources, right?  It just makes the resources they do have more flexible.

 

Good luck!

Interesting idea

I'd chuck in Steward of Gondor (as many copies as you have)- not re-readying Aragorn for two rounds versus massive income gain for one of the other characters seems an easy choice.

Yup Im aware of the 'song' card. I read carefully on Aragorn's ability...spend 1 resource from his resource pool! I beleive it doesnt have to be a leadership resource; thats why I thought of the song cards!

About Celebrians stone, I gave it some thought and I dont think I'll put it in deck. It costs 2 Leadership resources so that will mean not spending Aragorn's resource for 2 whole turns. That can be painfull with a bad encounter draw!!! I'd say the song is better choice! Thats just my opinion happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

As for the 0-cost cards, thats what you gotta be carefull...KEEP Aragorn alive; and besides, with his stats you cannot afford to lose him.

Steward of Gondor is very interesting; I didnt bring up a question for that attachment... My friend and I were a bit confused cause we found it overpowered so we just didnt play with it. When the card is in play, it only states to exhaust the attachment and not the hero. So my question is- Does it mean that the hero can be used AS WELL as gaining 2 resources from the attachment? I find that quite powerfull for a card.

Yep. Unless otherwise specified, attachments always exhaust and ready independent of the characters to which they are attached. So you can indeed exhaust Steward to add resources AND exhaust the hero to quest, attack, or defend during the same round. It's one of the most powerful cards in the game, but it's also unique, so there can only be one in play at any given time.
