Rocks!

I haven't seen anyone mention it, but Hail of Stones seems to fit very nicely into my dwarf deck.  Thalin tosses a point of damage on most enemies that hit the board, and I have been searching for ways to get more direct damage for the dwarves.  Infighting works well, but Hail of Stones has been a huge success for me thus far.  After all, almost every self respecting dwarf deck as at least one untapped character at all times (dain himself) and if you have another dwarf assisting him the stones can take out the vast majority of foes before they ever engage you.

In addition, the Lure of Moria makes adds even more synergy to this strategy.  I can't wait to to throw rocks at the witchking until he keels over and dies.

Fear the dwarven stones!

Nice idea :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I'll test it when I get RtR.

And if it's not enough: some gondorian spearmen will allways help you out!

There has been a lot talking about it on bgg right after the card was previewed. I totally agree, an ultimate Tactics card to deal with the staging area. It is great that Tactics is getting something like this because such card deals directly with progress. I have utilized it in my Dain deck as well - even though I do not run Thalin in it - but the other deck does. It fits as the number of allies is great just in that deck...

 

... and yeah, there's just much more going on now, Thalin, Unseen Strike, Descendant, Spearman... even the Rain of Arrows to finish the deal. Tactics is finally getting much better... or more varied in its approach.

Yeah that is defiantly a combo. Descendant, Beekeeper, That sentinel Guard, D.Axe, and more... lost of ways to get that extra point though. Thalin is just a star, that guy just gets better and better form Kaz onwards. I'm a big fan of beekeeper, with Ziggy you can cast him like 2 or 3  times a turn if you like.

Dain also combos with a song of travel / belt for that zero cost spirit card to tap a hero an place 2 tokens when you travelled location.. it works for the same reason.. he is almost always untapped. In fact if you get the belt on him so he can change his icon at will there is a number of cards that require the tapping of a character / hero. He makes many of these previously useless cards very playable.

I think he is easily one of the most powerful Heroes out there, in solo if your running dwalfs you need him and there is little reason to ever NOT run him in a co-op game. While I like this I also dislike any card that appears in every single deck.... still awesome card no doubt.

 Now with the new Arwen ally card, you can combo it with Dain and give him sentinel and +1 defense.  Since he's always ready till the end, he becomes a wall with +4 defense and 5 hit pts to withstand eleven the worse attacks.  Gotta love the dwarf deck, even if you're not a dwarf fan!

Yeah, it feels wrong to run a Dwarven deck without him. And in coop, he shines ever more. I had thought Thalin quite useless (probably not deservingly) before Dain appeared. No he can really make a difference while questing as well as most.

I had also considered Beekeeper totally overpriced for what he did. Then I changed my mind again.

I think that this would be even more amazing in a Rohan deck. You can just exhaust everyone to get that damage, and then Sneak Attack or let Eomund die to ready all of them again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
