 Need a quick rules check please…

 

Cave torch causes you to discard top card and if enemy add to staging area but during goblin patrol enemies revealed are discarded rather than added to staging area but enemies discovered while using the torch aren't considered revealed and so are still added to the staging area right?

 Just checked FAQ and its clear in there it was different - I've been away from the boards for a while though and checking the FAQ there's been some serious card changes - 

 

Beravor's update prevents use with UC I assume? PoL nerfed! What's been going on?!!?!
