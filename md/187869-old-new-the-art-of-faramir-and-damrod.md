# [Old &amp; New - The art of Faramir and Damrod](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187869-old-new-the-art-of-faramir-and-damrod/)

This is something I just noticed, and found to be kind of cool; the art for the Faramir character in ME:TW CCG and the art for the Damrod hero in LotR LCG have so much similarities it almost looks like the latter pays homage to the former (although I guess it's probably just a coincidence).

This made me think generally on whether the art of LotR LCG is ever inspired by the art of ME:TW CCG. I remember finding similar art similarities a couple of time in the past (maybe Fatty Bolger and Dagger of Westernesse, to some degree, though not really. Or Beregond), but it's really hard to know if those are intentional homages or just that these are some specific characters, items and locations that were either so well described in the books or was given some definitive artistic interpretation by some third artist, that anyone drawing them is bound to come up with something the reminds you of past art.

The Faramir-Damrod thing, however, is just uncanny. Most of all the pose.

Maybe we should interview some of these artists!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

Why on earth does Faramir have the Dunadan trait? Also the singular version Dunadan as opposed to Dunedain just looks awful.

Those stances and art are indeed very similar.

Technically, most people from Gondor should have the Dunedain trait.  They're the Dunedain of the South (as opposed to the Rangers/Grey Company that are the Dunedain or the North).  I think it's just a way to separate out trait synergies, as it wouldn't make much sense for Rangers of the North to benefit from Gondor buffs and vice versa.

Well technically they have muddied their bloodlines with other men so are not full or proper Dunedain any more. I suppose royal bloodlines may have stayed pure so men like Faramir, Boromir, Denethor and Prince Imrahil could be considered as Dunedain but I would not consider all men of Gondor dunedain.

You are aware that Dunadan is the correct singular form as opposed to the plural Dunedain which is inconsistent with the rest of the traits right? As for the art, I also noted the similarities but I think it's unlikely there's any intention of being a homage or anything like that.

I don't think "Dunedain" is necessarily inconsistent with the other traits. It just means that character is a member of the Dunedain. If the traits were always singular then we would see traits like "Gondorian", "Member of the Raven Clan", and "Uruk of Saruman" as traits rather than "Gondor", "Raven Clan", and "Uruk-hai"

And "Noldo" of Elrond, Galadriel, Gildor etc. Noldor and Sindar are plural forms.

 

As for lineage, Gandalf tells Pippin in RotK that the blood of Númenor runs true in Denethor and Faramir. So calling him a Dúnadan is no great stretch, I think, though we certainly don't often think of him as one. It literally means "Man of the West".

 

edit: And the image does look very similar!

Yeah I know Dunadan is the singular form, it just looks ugly haha

Makes you really notice the difference in presentation, detail quality and artwork of the new cards doesnt it.
