# [The juicebox LOTR LCG Solo Player Tournament (#2) [December 4-10, 2011] [COMPLETED]](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/)

## 1 [juicebox on December 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=563528)

Welcome & Introduction:

Welcome to what looks to be my second Solo Player LOTR LCG Tournament of the Week. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.

Note: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.)

Will you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!

After the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. Specifically, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].

Hi,

 

For my first try on this quest i choose to play a leadership deck (Prince Imrahil, Theodred, Gloin). Unfortunetaly, i only achieved victory on turn 7.

 

Final Score 100

 

Round markers : 6 (60)

Threat : 36

Wounds on heroes : 4

Total : 100

## 3 [muemakan on December 4, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=563775)

I am afraid this tends to be a boring, very luck dependent quest. Maybe there should be 4 different top ten lists for each sphere. I tried spirit.

It all depends on the last quest card for spirit. If you draw the card where you have to defeat the spider, it´s over. If you get Beorn´s Path its easy. 

I always had an escort or astonishing speed in my starting hand. (mulligan helps) So I get 12 willpower in the first round.

I think the only thing that could been better is to draw a encounter card with just one threat or none and finish the first quest card in round 1.

( I think there are only 3 cards with 1 threat or none that don´t affect the first turn questing, so this is nearly impossible)

 

Rounds: 3

Threat: 24

Wounds: 2

Total: 56

Nice work you two! Yes, I'm curious to see which sphere ends up getting the most play.

muemakan, which Spirit heroes did you use? (I'll update the Top Ten with their names.)

Thanks muemakan!

Also, I was finally able to get in some play time tonight...

I went with Leadership (Aragorn, Théodred, Prince Imrahil)

Threat: 31

Hero Wounds: 1

Round Tracker: 50

Total Score: 82

## 7 [muemakan on December 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=563976)

 Aslo I think it might be a good idea to not only put down the score, but also the last quest card. Mine was Beorn´s Path. (which for spirit makes it much easier)

## 8 [leptokurt on December 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=563982)

After tryring this scenario with a tactics deck first (best score: 95) I then gave the lore fellowship a chance. After 6 games I didn't get a score below 120. I even lost two games, but then I managed a run through, abusing Protector of Lorien to its limit (plus a trio of Rivendell Minstrells). If Bilbo hadn't died through a shadow effect in my penultimate turn, the score would have been even better.

 

Heroes: Glorfindel, Denethor, Bilbo

 

Result: 93

 

Threat: 34

Dead Hero: 1 (8 points)

Damage: 1

Rounds: 5

 

Stage 3B: Beorn's Path

## 9 [Chac2 on December 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=564041)

After several new attempts with my Leadership deck, i finaly win this quest with a score of 89

 

Heroes : Prince Imrahil, Theodred, Gloin

Third stage of the quest : "Don't Leave the Path!"

 

Round Markers : 5 (50)

Threat : 33

Wounds on heroes : 6

Victory Points : 0

 

Final Score : 89

## 10 [juicebox on December 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=564053)

Nice idea muemakan. I won't make it obligatory, but if anyone includes that information in their post, I'll add it to the Top Ten listing content.

 

ps: The 3B Quest Card for my Leadership deck score of 82 was "Don’t Leave the Path!"  I think in my case, it was almost a wash because it took me an extra turn to kill Ungoliant's Spawn anyway, just as it might have taken me at least an extra turn to quest 10 for victory. However, I was more assured of the kill than the successful questing, so "Don't Leave the Path!" was probably the slightly quicker option for me.

I definately agree with the "luck based" comments here. I've played a few spirit and a few leadership games so far but my last leadership game I think might be virtually unbeatable. I did use the most pwerful combo in the game on turn 1, and probably also played the best in sphere card, but even so I was amazed at how quickly the quest was won...

Heroes: Imrahil, Aragorn, Gloin

Turns: (finished in turn 2!) 10

Wounds: 0

Threat: 28

Result: 38

 

3rd Stage: Don't leave the Path

## 12 [plueschi2 on December 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=564083)

I'm in the same boat as leptokurt, trying different spheres for the fun of it.

So I started with tactics and got a score of 114.

Heroes Boromir, Gimli, Legolas

stage 3B Beorns Path

## 13 [leptokurt on December 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=564139)

And another lore expedition through the Mirkwood:

 

heroes: Glorfindel, Denethor, Bilbo

 

result: 76

 

threat: 33

rounds: 4 (40 points)

damage: 3

 

 

This time I got two Gandalfs in my starting hand. Furthermore I had Protector of Lorien and a Rivendell Minstrell. The adventure didn't began promising, but thanks to Denethor's foresight my group avoided an orc camp led by Chieftain Ufthal. The group decided to travel the Old Forest Road, not listening to Beorn's warnings. There they crossed the way of a nasty King Spider which immediatly hurt Glorfindel while Denethor kept a Forest Spider away.

Next the heroes heard some distant cries, apparently coming from a Great Forest Web, but they decided not to travel there. On their way they met Gandalf who helped them escape both spiders. He killed the Forest Spider with a mighty spell, and used his staff to kill the King Spider which had attacked Denethor before.

In round 3 the group was followed by a Beastmaster, but managed to keep him at distance. Joined by a Rivendell Minstrell the heroes eventually travelled to the Great Forest Web while using Protector of Lorien to get through stage 1B.

In round 4 a Forest Gate appeared. The fellowship chose to travel through it. Cunning Radagast send some help so the Beastmaster posed no threat, which enabled the group to finish stage 2B. The fooled Beastmaster became very angry and attacked Denethor, but the latter stood his ground.

In the final turn Gandalf returnd and delivered some new resources (3 cards). The fellowship lost some of them (3 cards) when the were haunted by The Eyes Of The Forest, but then Gandalf led them quickly to the end of Beorn's Path and left the haunted woods.

After several attempts with different hero constellations I managed to win with the spirit deck (Dunhere, Eowyn and Frodo). My 3B card was Beorn's Path. I killed Hummerhorns with Dunhere the round before the last one.

Threat: 12

Hero Wounds: 1

Round Tracker: 80

Victory Points (Hummerhorns): 5

Total Score: 88

Ok, that´s insane.......you got to tell us how you did it.........there must be a sneak attack gandalf involved. 

But apart from that I cannot imagine anything.

Hah...interesting. i was thinking that the quickest way to beat this quest was in 3 turns, tackling one stage each turn. But of course if you draw Don't Leave the Path, you can actually finish in 2. Good stuff on defeating the Spawn in one go!

Can I take a wild stab at the cards you played? Obviously Sneak Attack / Gandalf and Steward of Gondor, than Gandalf again on turn 2 which leaves you with 2 resources....For Gondor! perhaps? But then who took the Forest Spider wound...there must have been an ally, so For Gondor! is out.  Did you perhaps play a Snowbourne Scout? let that be my guess for the cards you played: Sneak Attack, Gandalf, Steward of Gondor, Gandalf, and Snowbourne Scout. Close?

Those are in fact the exact cards I played!  - Do you want to have a guess at the play of events to?

I'll give you a clue Imrahil got sticky and there was an animal lover involved...

Easy! Caught in a Web on turn 1, Dol Guldur Beastmaster on turn 2.

And you travelled to Old Forest Road, I presume.

SoG and Sneak Gandalf in Turn one......killing the Spider with Gandalf and getting very lucky with the encounter card. Snowborn Scout and Gandalf in Turn 2.....which leaves one resource to ready aragorn ( quested with aragorn, imrahil and gandalf) . Travel to the old forest road......ready Gandalf. Ungoliant Spawn kills Snowborn Scout. Imrahil readys........Aragorn, Imrahil and Gandalf attack spider FTW.

That´s my guess how he did it. Thats an insane starting hand for any scenario. Also very lucky with the first encounter card.

Yeah - Gandalf and sneak attack plus Steward of Gondor in the starting hand was awesome, but if I don't have one of those in my initial start hand I will mulligan. Still getting both seems pretty unlikely (I'm running three of each in a 50 card deck - anyone got the maths skills to work out the odds?)


Whilst I usually cringe when I see Caught in the Web it was indeed a really lucky draw in this case as Imrahil basically made it useless against me (if the game went longer though, it would have probably cost me). As someone said earlier though there are very few cards that I could have drawn that wouldn't have stopped me completing stage 1 of the quest in turn 1.

Likewise Beastmaster is a horrible card, but only if you have to interact with it, 2 threat is nothing against the questing power of Gandalf!

Turn two was a quest with Aragorn, Imrahil and Gandalf  - Aragorn readies himself, Gandalf was readied through travel to the forest road, and Imrahil was readied when the spawn ate my snowbourne scout.

Taking out The big nasty required all og my characters Aragorn, Imrahil, Gandalf and Gloin. (12 vs 2 DEF = 10 damage)

As it turns out If I had run Theodred in Gloins place I could have probably finished this quest with a score one point higher... And have been able to play the Citadel Guard I had in my hand for an extra bit of security...

 Decided to try this first with Tactics - always a terrible idea for solo mono-sphere, but never mind.

First attempt I choose my heroes by their abilities- Legolas, Boromir, Thalin -sadly their combined questing power of 3 was not enough, and even Gandalf could only delayed the inevitable. I hit threat 50 on about turn 14.

Second attempt, subbed Gimli in for Thalin for that extra questing power. Got Gandalf and born aloft in my starting hand. Put winged guardian out as a blocker, which delayed Gandalf till round 3,  cleared stage 1 in round 6, did stage 2 and 3 in one round each (Ungoliant's spawn came out at end of 1 round, and died in the next)- got Don't leave the path, through an eagle in as a blocker, and hit back with a damaged Gimli, Legolas, and a vassal of the windlord to finish him off.

Final threat 32
3 Damage (Gimli)
4 Victory Points (Ufthak)

7 rounds completed

score: 101

 

will hopefully be back later in the week with a better score from another sphere...

Do you have Radagast in your deck? He's the key for successful questing, and he's also able to help you buy some eagle allies. I always try to get him in my starting hand and play him in round 2. Switching to Gimli was a good idea. I use him to quest as often as possible.

 Played one game with Lore, but could not improve my score.

 

Then played one game with Leadership and got a score of 96. Heroes have been Theodred, Aragorn and Imrahil. 3B was Don't leave the Path.

I tried to work it out, but I didn't cover every single possible scenario (mainly the combo in which you get only one of those two cards in the first scenario, and both after taking a mulligan). However, the probability to get exactly those two cards is round about 16 percent. Which means you should get the Gandalf/Sneack Attack combo in every 7th game (which is not too unlikely).

The probability to get either Gandalf or Sneak attack is approx. 80 percent, and the probability just to get Gandalf (with or without Sneak Attack) is at approx. 54 percent.

 Did 2 games with Spirit, lost the first one (thanks Ungolianths Spawn!) but won the other with a score of 75.

I also tried a tactics deck with Gimli, Brand and Legolas.

35 Final Threat, 6 Wounds, 4 Turns........Score: 81

That was a reminder for me how awful tactics is at questing.

Why are we limited to a single sphere?  I don't want this to sound like criticism, but given the very limited amount of cards that we currently have access to, limiting it to a single sphere doesn't encourage creative deckbuilding in my opinion.  We're just going to see a bunch of players all building the same thing, and building decks that work well for 1 quest but not for others.  Case in point, Bungo scored a 38 and other players try to copy his result, probably with a build that only varies by 2 or 3 cards.  At that point it's not even a competition, its just a game of "who can get the luckiest draw once we figure out the best deck."  Maybe its just me, but part of the fun of deckbuilding games is to be creative with all the tools that are available and to come up with strategies and combos...

 Last entry for myself.........scored a 65 with lore.

Heros: Glorfindel, Beravor and Bilbo

Final Threat 35, Wounds 0, Final Score 65. Stage 3B was Beorns Path. ( Protector of Lorien was the game winner).

I am thankful for the one-sphere restriction. I know that deckbuilding is not possible here (I only have the first 3 AP's, so all I can do is to choose three cards to discard), but this way you're forced (or, from my perspective, allowed) to use cards that you never played before. Did you ever play Thicket Of Spears? I never used this card before, and probably never will (unless there will be a Song of Make Me Tactics someday), but it's such a great feeling when Uungoliant's spawn and its friends try to kill you and you just - bang - neutralize them all with one single card.

You're right about the scoring though. But then this problem is caused by the game's character itself which makes it impossible to create a satisfying scoring system.

I think the obvious way to improve on the 38 is to not kill the Spider with Gandalf but have him lower threat by 5 when he appears. As long as the Spider doesn't deal more than 5 wounds and doesn't cost you an extra turn, the end result should be better than 38.

You have to kill the spider because of it´s two threat points if you haven´t got a celebrians stone. And even if you do........you cannot afford to draw an encounter card with more than one threat if you leave the spider in the staging area.

 Second attempt- decided to give Lore a go.

Hadn't used Bilbo since they changed the scoring system, so I thought I'd give him a  try - first attempt, even with a fast hitch, I was getting nowhere. Eventually finished in 8 rounds, with a million cards, no resources, and a worse score than my tactics attempt.

Tried again...

quicker start. Gandalf in rd 2 to kill the spider and quest. 5th turned cleared the 1st stage, with lots of elves in play. Easy stage 2. Drew Beorn's path, which was a pain, but I drew a minstrel to add to the questing, threw everyone in, and played Radagast's Cunning to get the progress needed for the win.

36 Threat

1 Damage

6 Rounds completed

 

total score 97

 

it's a tiny improvement, but not much- this is the first time in ages i've played solo mono-sphere, it's really frustrating not being able to access so many of the abilities and strengths. Interesting tho.

The idea would be to let it engage and deal 1 wound on turn 1 (defended) and 2 wounds (undefended) in turn 2. 3 wounds vs. Gandalf's 5 threat reduction would still give you an overall score of  36, all else being equal.

But if you let the spider live, you probably won´t get to stage 2 in the first round........so no way to get to victory in turn 2.

Also there is nobody to defend against the spider in turn 1.

if you travel to Old Forest Road on turn 1, you will have someone to defend against the Spider. If you need the Road's effect on turn 2 to have enough attackers available to kill the spawn, obviously it doesn't work and Gandalf indeed needs to kill the Spider on turn 1.

 Finally got around to playing after 5 finals in two days.  

Sphere: Spirit

Heroes: Eowyn, Dunhere, and Eleanor

Rounds: 4

Final Threat: 28

Damage on heroes: 0

Final Score: 68

Beorns Path

Saw mostly locations which is nice cause I had only questing power

Felt good to finally play again!  Hopefully I can talk my wife into playing in the monthly tournament with me sometime during our time off from school.

Alright, I'm on the board with Tactics!

Thalin, Boromir, Legolas

50 points for 6 turns

plus 2 damage on Boromir

plus 41 ending threat

= 93 points

I got "Don't Leave the Path!" to help speed things along and had a squadron of eagles bearing down on it

Thursday, and I decided to try Spirit

first attempt was Frodo, Eowyn, Eleanor - not a bad effort, but the total lack of attack really crippled me. Also had to Gandalf some Hummerhorns. Took six rounds, but a creditable 93 (4 better than yesterday's attempt nonetheless)

Decided on a change of hero, and went again:

Dunhere, Eowyn, Frodo

Played nothing 1st turn, Gandalf 2nd. Killed the spider with entry damage and finished 1st stage of quest with his willpower. 2nd stage done easily in one go. Got Beorn's path in final stage, and drew an Escort from Edoras. Threw everyone at questing, and by discarding one card to boost Eowyn, managed to get all ten progress.

27 Threat
3 Damage (1 per hero)

3 rounds

Final Score 60

it might not be up there with magic 38s of Leadership, but I'm pretty happy with that.

Whew, finally managed a good score.

 

Sphere: Spirit

Heroes: Frodo, Dunhere, Eowyn

Don't know if the card names are right, don't have all english names in mind

First round played Escort from Edoras, quested with all chars. Encounter was the necromancers reach but canceled it. First stage done, traveled to forrest road readiing Dunhere to damage the spider. Second turn played the just drawn Eomund, send him an Eowyn on quest, revealed forrest gate. explored forrest road finished 2nd stage and due to some luck i drew Beorns Path , traveled to forrest gate and drew two cards, ancient mathom and astonishing speed. spider attack was undefended, no shadow effect raising threat (thanks frodo) by three in retunr the hobbit and dunhere smashed this ugly bug. 3rd turn. played nothing wanted to keep my resources for ast. speed and hoped for a good encounter. and it came, caught in a web (attached to dunhere, but who cares?) explored the forest gate and finsished last stage

Threat: 29

Wounds: 0

Rounds: 3 (2 completed)

Final score: 49

Thanks for putting together these tournaments: I look forward to playing more in the future. After a few losses with a lore deck, I took leadership for a spin:  Imrahil, Dain, and Gloin were the heroes. Finished on the 6th turn, with a threat of 39 and a wound each on Imrahil and Gloin. 3B was Don't Leave the Path. Final score: 101.

## 45 [ClydeCloggie on December 9, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=565686)

Didn't get anywhere with Spirit, so switched to Leadership.

Gloin/Imrahil/Aragorn

Turns: 4 (finished on 5th turn)

Threat: 31

Wounds: 3

Score: 74

Beorn's Path was negotiated by all heroes, a Sneak Gandalf  and 2 Guards, all boosted by Faramir's effect. That was enough to overcome the Mountains of Mirkwood and a Beastmaster in the SA, and an active Great Forest Web.

Will now go to Lore to see what that sphere can do.

Hopefully I'll stay on the board with this one:

Brand, Gimli, Legolas

40 points for 5 turns

plus 4 damage on Gimli, 3 on Legolas

Minus 5 for Hummerhorns

37 Ending threat

= 79 points

I used Quick Strike to complete stage 2 and then I got "Don't Leave the Path!" fortunately. Radagast was a huge help in questing

Keeping Tactics alive!

Hi,

I had the opportunity to play some games today, here's my best score on this quest

 

Heroes : Prince Imrahil, Theodred, Gloin

Third stage of the quest : "Beorn's Path"

Round markers : 3 (30)

Final threat : 26

Wounds on heroes : 3

Victory points : 5  (Hummerhorns)

Took about ten games with scores in the 70's ad 80's but finally got the deck to work the way I hoped it would... more or less.

 

Spirit Deck (Dunhere, Eowyn and Frodo)

Final Threat 21

Rounds: 3 (won on 4th)

3B: Beorn's Path

Total: 51 points

 

First round Escort to Edoras, all quest drew another Old Forest Road and ditched a Northern Tracker to Eowyn's ability to complete 1B.

Second Round: Galhadrim's Greeting to lower threat, quest Eowyn and Frodo, drew Caught int he Web and canceled with A Test of Will.  Just enough to move complete 2B.  Drew Beorn's path.  Dunhere hits spider for 2.

Third Round:  Stand and Fight Escort Back.  Quest all but Dunhere.  Draw Great Forest Web, ditch a Dwarven Tomb for 5 on the quest.  Dunhere kills spider.

Fourth Round:  Dwarven Tomb the Stand and Fight and get Escort Back for the third time.  Quest all characters.  Draw a Dol Golder Beastmaster.  Just enough quest to finish.

 

This game was all about the Escort to Edoras.  Awesome questing card.  Just wish I'd been able to knock out 3B in round 3 rather than 4.  Another Escort may have done it?

I tried some games with my lore fellowship. I manged to improve my result a tiny bit.

 

Heroes: Glorfindel, Denethor, Bilbo

Result: 73

 

rounds: 40 points

threat: 33 points

damage: zero

stage 3B: Beorn's Path

 

Fortunatly I used Denethor's ability in my first turn to deflect Ungoliant's Spawn. In used Denethor as a defender and the rest of the fellwoship for questing. Bilbo got caught in a net, but was freed by an Iron Hill Miner one round later. Henamart travelled with my group right from the beginning of the passage, Gandalf had an appearance in round 2, Mapmaker joined them in round 4.  It took me two turns to complete stage 1B. one turn for stage 2B and turns for stage 3B. Of course I had Protector of Lorien (played round 3) to help me. In the end it was a close rund and I had to sacrifice every card and every resource to complete 3B (Protector + Mapmaker + Radagast's Cunning + Secret Paths).

I like this idea. happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] Consider it in the works. Since the top three for both Leadership and Spirit are currently in the Top Ten overall, my plan at this point will be to create an Honorable Mention category for this week in the main post to show off the top three results for both Tactics and Lore. As it stands currently, the entire Top Ten is either Leadership or Spirit with the exception of leptokurt's Lore result. Interestingly, muemakan's Lore result is also Top Ten worthy and would be included, were it not for his ridiculously excellent tie with Bungo_Underhill for top of the pile.

Nice job everyone. You're all heroes in my book.

Hi,

Because we have two different options for the third stage of the quest, it would also be interesting (not for this week's tournament but for the next time playing this quest) to have a final score for each optional 3B stage.

Player's will add the score for "Beorn's Path" to the score for "Don't leave the Path" and share their result (with details of each game of course).

This challenge will be not for single sphere deck (because in this case we will have a top ten Leadership decks) but for constructed decks.

Congrats to EVERYONE who participated in this week’s Solo Player Tournament!

It was a pleasure hosting and a delight to see all the various experimentation with monosphere decks and fascinating display [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=587345] of theoretical prowess. You’ve all been brilliant. In the end, while Leadership and Spirit spheres proved overwhelmingly triumphant in blitzing this particular quest, do check out the Honorable Mention section after this week’s Top Ten to highlight the accomplishments of those who had success with Tactics and Lore. Nicely done, everybody!
