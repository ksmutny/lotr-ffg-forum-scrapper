Hello

Is there a list of the cards of the collectors edition and from which expansion they are?

Thanks

Greetings

Werner

Thanks I know Hall of Beorn. What I look for is a list where I can find that Kili original card comes from the â€˜The Hobbit - Over Hill and Under Hillâ€™ Saga expansion for example.

If thereâ€™s no list I can use Hall of Beorn to find out but if thereâ€™s already a list...Â

Yeah I don't think there is a list like that anywhere. You'll have to do the homework yourself unfortunately.
