How often does FFG release a new version of the official FAQ? The current on is quite old, since 10/28/2011. Can we petition FFG to make an update? But both Kazadum and Redhorn Gate are out since and there has also been answers in the official responses threads in the forun. The unofficial FAQ is a help, but it would be nice to have Nate rulings.

you could, i know we had success with petitioning catagories- but that was a concern over all levels of players, i think that most  players already have access to, or know answers to most of the faqed topics, so may not sign up, as they have been here when the topics were brought up on the forum

 it certianly would be nice to have a regularly updated FAQ- ie. every ad pack that raises new questions a new update comes out, and this would make more sense than twice a year and have to rely on the unnofficial one every other time, which can be wrong anyways.

what may be more realistic is getting them to start stickying nates official update thread- which does exist......somewhere

also i started the last petition and that wasnt exactly easy to get interest in that

 I agree completely.  For what it is worth, all but 5 things (which are marked) in my unofficial FAQ are officially confirmed one way or another.
