So I am already suspecting that we will get a hero version of Gandalf before the Ring Cycle is over. Any leads, thughts, anticipation, fears? ;-)

I for one will really be happy when they make him!

Bring it on!  Along with Varya...then you can have all three elven ring-bearers for an epic deck of ultra-brokenness.  

 

But...how the heck are they going to balance a Gandalf hero?  He's ridiculously powerful.

Ents are too very strong, but here we have an 2/2/2/3 ent. So, don't worry - they'll find a away.

I hope nobody plays Gandalf hero if he plays with me. I'd like to play my Gandalf ally.

What i would really like in "The Road Darkens" is to get a new Boromir ally so i can play the entire fellowship in a 2P game but also to get a new Gandalf Ally version. Though i would happily accept a Gandalf Hero.

## 7 [lleimmoen on May 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1075442)

Makes all the sense we get Boromir ally in the Road Darkens. I had been saying that for a long time now. You need the Fellowship and both hero versions of Boromir come in different expansions. Gandalf hero makes all the sense as well.

Gandalf as a hero seems most likely in the saga expansions to me. (Possibly as a real hero, maybe only as a saga specific hero).

Surely since every deck must feature a gandalf ally he would still be playable as a hero and an ally? Unless they errata it.

As op as that would be, a new Gandalf ally would most likely be unique. So the hero and the ally would not be playable at the same time because they have the same name, even though they are different card types.

Every deck doesn't have to use a Gandalf ally. That's how the original decks are set up in the core set - but when you start building them yourself you can leave out Gandalf if you wish (I often do).

If a player was running Gandalf as hero you would be unable to play your Gandalf ally cards if the hero was in play. (I think technically you could play them and then choose one of the cards to leave play - but that's pretty wasteful).

Oh didn't realise that. I thought the rulebook stated that it had to contain one in the deck customization section. May take mine out then. Though he is useful for lowering threat

According to the books, Galadriel was more powerfull than Gandalf, but they found a way to represent her very accurately. Ok after her show on destroying dol guldur, which is way back from the game era, she never made any real appearences so they made the trick and she looks great. I am sure they will come up something for Gandalf

## 18 [Raven1015 on May 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1075924)

Well, we've gotten Vilya and now we're getting Nenya with Galadriel. If we do get a Gandalf hero at some point, I assume this means that Narya should come one day as well. Vilya grants the free play of cards, while Nenya allows Galadriel to add her willpower. What should Narya do? The ring of fire was said to have the power of helping to remove weariness and helping to inspire people against despair. What would that look like in game terms?

## 19 [Glowwyrm on May 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1075974)

Removing weariness sounds like readying to me.  Inspiring people against despair sounds like a stat boost.  Imagine a personal, transferable Unexpected Courage, that can ready nearly anybody or give anyone a stat boost during any action window.  If he gets a ring that does anything like that, he'll be ridiculous.  But then again, he'd better be, otherwise everyone else at the table will be annoyed that they can't play their Gandalf allies.  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

This would be so broken with the Hobbit Gandalf.

It's a neat idea but I don't think it would work.

Grandspleen, your suggestion is actually completely thematic and I think could work if they make the wording airtight.  However, I am in the camp of not making him a hero as well, at least not any time soon.  We have plenty of high threat, high powered heroes, I would rather see some of the other traits fleshed out with lower or mid cost heroes.

Could be like a Sam ability but applies to another person. Ready and add +1 to all? Or maybe only willpower. Seems decent.

Why is everyone so negative about doubling up an ally with a new hero? I've already had to take my Gandalf and Faramir out of my decks because another deck had Faramir hero and my other friend used persistent Hobbit Gandalf.

We have quite a lot of double ups already and everyone seems to want a third Boromir (although maybe only for thematic reasons?), and everyone seems super keen about a Haldir hero. So why not Gandalf? It seems like people are blowing his expected threat cost and abilities out of hand. He hobbles are holding a stick most of the time, haha. Look at the thematic and low cost Galadriel for an example of good game design.

We will see some continued doubling and some form of Gandalf hero for sure. He is the most iconic character in any of the books or movies.

Thematically Gandalf shows up when you need him; which is pretty decently expressed by his card text on both ally versions to "discard him at the end of the round".

He is someone that you are happy about when he makes an appearance in the darkest of times but since his work is never done and he is always needed somewhere else, he cannot stay too long.

Yeah I don't want a Gandalf hero either but it seems like it will happen. I also don't want a Haldir hero or at least have no interest in one, I'm psyched to have the three brothers as allies, works better that way I reckon.

I think not giving us a hero Gandalf is a good move.  Every time I get to play Gandalf into my table it is a big event. It is as if the other cards cry "Mithrandir is come, we are saved!", you know, the essence of eucatastrophe. This makes so much thematic sense. Having a Gandalf hero at our disposal at all times would take all that away.

 

With that said, I would not mind if he is made a hero tied only to a quest or two (as Bilbo or Frodo). That would give us this toy we all want to play with, but only for a while and it would end before it gets boring and all to common. 

## 32 [DurinIII on May 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1076940)

I completely understand where all you "Gandalf hero haters" are coming from. ;-) You make some good points. Here's how I ultimately see it: any hero they choose to create in this game is one more hero I own and can choose from. If Gandalf is not a viable LOTR hero, then Caledra and that Lore elf hero aren't either. I'd much rather they make actual characters into heroes (like good ol' Gandy) before making some up.

## 33 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1076941)

An appropriate place for Gandalf to show up as a hero would be in The Road Darkens saga set. He is so central to the Moria episode.

I´d more suspect that he will appear as an objective ally, but we´ll see.

Doubling is fine, and inevitable.  I'd rather see multi-sphere versions of my favorite heroes than lots of FFG created heroes.  But doubling does make co-op more difficult, especially if you don't have time to coordinate decks beforehand.  This is why I think a hero Gandalf would be such a big deal.  Faramir the ally is a great card, but if someone shows up with Faramir the hero, there are a few in-sphere options for replacing what he does (Sword that was Broken, Visionary Leadership, Dain).  There isn't a replacement for Gandalf.  Whether you're a leadership deck using the Sneak Attack-Core combo, a low threat deck running Hobbit Gandalf as a fourth hero, a Tactics deck relying on Gandalf to drop their threat, etc.  There's no way to replace his neutral sphere versatility.  I know that there are sometimes conflicts because someone is running Hobbit Gandalf and someone else wants to play Core Gandalf, but if the person who needs to play Core Gandalf is that desperate, you can always allow Hobbit Gandalf to be discarded at the end of the round.  A hero Gandalf would take away that flexibility, and lock down any deck that was counting on Gandalf in some shape or form.  That's why the hero Gandalf would have to be amazing.  otherwise, he wouldn't be worth it. 

That's why I think we could have a saga specific Gandalf hero in store.  It makes a lot of sense for him to appear at this point in the story, it would be very cool to recreate Gandalf's moments of glory (who isn't excited about the idea of Gandalf taking down the Balrog?), and would maintain the balance for the rest of the quests.  

## 40 [DurinIII on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078007)

If they simply made a Gandalf hero with stats 4wp, 4a, 4d, and 4hp without any abilities on his card, that would be insanely amazing. Make him Lore and make his starting cost 15 or 16. His abilities would come in with his items, sword, staff, ring etc. Such a Gandalf would easily rival the ally version.

## 41 [lleimmoen on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078279)

Oh, he must be Neutral, I feel. It really fits his character, I feel. Gandalf had no home, he travelled tirelessly to help anywhere he could. He could be kind and funny, he could be great and terrible, a supporter or a leader when needed, though never through finding respect in others out of fear.

## 42 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078325)

Long I suspected Saruman as a hero with shifting resource Icon. He was a neutral by default and at the setup, you were able to choose a resource icon for him until the end of the game.

## 43 [lleimmoen on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078332)

Saruman of Many Colours, that would make sense. On the other hand, at this stage he was already altogether corrupted. By the way, has anyone had success with the Saruman ally? I sort of hesitate to play him, partly because of the theme but he also does not seem too intriguing as a strategy option -- but I say this totally without experience.

## 44 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078343)

He is great. Costs only 3, puts one encounter card out of their misery for the entire turn and hits hard for 5. I would say that he is most usable in the quest where to proceed you need to get rid of something. Like, second quest of Black Riders - just flipping one of the Nazguls for the entire turn, and then dealing with it's brethren and winning.

Best time I used him must have been to remove a hunter from mordor, who was in the staging area, while 4 clue cards where in play and then quest the game to victory with just 2 willpower to spare.

Yes, he seems an excellent end-game card, unless you are in deep with the threat. Alternatively, he can also be great to overcome opening odds. So yes, I see he must be good, and I need to try him. The doom decks have thus far been a bit of a disappointment for me though.

## 47 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078399)

You don't need to run a doomed deck to use him.

## 48 [lleimmoen on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078592)

Of course, I won't. If I use him, I probably will in the Silvan deck with Galadriel to get two actions out of him. He quests nicely and shall fight even better. Plus, Galadriel can sort of keep the threat low. And the Island Amid Perils might help even more.

Making Gandalf neutral (and only able to spend resources on neutral cards) I think is the main point they have to help balance him. 

## 50 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078807)

If he'll be able to only pay for neutral cards, then it'll be dullest decision ever. My bet is that he won't be 4/4/4/4, but will be really strong, with some drawback.

## 51 [tacomen253 on May 9, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1078883)

@Rapier, Gandalf only able to pay for neutral cards seems counter intuitive. Like lleimmoen was saying, his story is that he appears wherever he is needed with the support of his wizard abilities, whether he is supporting humans, elves, or dwarfs (he is not sphere"ist"). Limiting him to paying for only neutral cards is the exact opposite of why FFG made his ally version a neutral card that can be played with under any sphere. That is my objective analysis.

 

My subjective analysis is that to make a hero Gandalf only able to pay for neutral cards is silly. I personally never have more than 10% neutral cards in any of my decks, making Gandalf's resources essentially useless. And if you did have at least a third of your deck neutral cards, your other sphere's main focus will be on allies since there are a lack of neutral ones. Deck building is the acme of skill in this game, but limiting your flexability in deck building by using a duo neutral/sphere is poor strategizing.

You can splat a song on him, yet still it will be dumb. And songs are not from the core set, so people without Mirkwood cycle would stuck in a very bad position.

Caldara is not useless.  I hope that they use the remaining hero slots to flesh out some of the traits (Halbarad), or maybe for some new characters from the book.  There are still several Rohan characters we haven't seen that could be heroes.  Maybe Earkenbrand (Tactics), Hama (Lore), or Gamling (Leadership)?

Yea, I really wouldn't mind if we had a (select) few more heroes that aren't from the material if they are well designed.  At some point they will need to look at some pretty obscure characters for heroes anyway.  One thought I had was hero for Bergil (son of Beregond).  Spirit, 3 threat, 2 WP, 0 ATK, 0 DEF, 1 HP.  Gondor.  While Bergil is ready, all Gondor characters gain "Action: exhaust this card and Bergil to give a Gondor character +1 DEF until the end of the turn."  Anyway, before I went way off topic, I think the new characters can be fine if they are spread out and have interesting abilities.

Since yes we need a Gandalf ring so probably we will have a Gandalf hero. But what kind of hero he can be??? He is to powerful 4/4/4 Maybe he can be only alone as a hero? And belong to all spheres?

Gandalf: Sphere Lore. Cost: 15 WP 4 AT 3 DF 3 HP 4

Ability: Lower Gandalf's starting threat cost by 1 for each Hobbit hero you control.

I think they should do what decipher did and make different versions of the same hero. We already have this with a few characters: Aragorn and Borimir. That way Gandalf could eventually show up in every sphere.

So... four cards of hero Gandalf included in the next Saga box, one for each sphere? well, I was not at all enthusiastic for the whole idea of hero Gandalf, but this would actually change my mind. Come to think about it, it might make sense in a weird way. In other Sagas hero count was much higher. Now, if I recall correctly, we are supposed to get just a quests-specific Frodo plus just one additional new hero. Just one or perhaps...? :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] But it is just pure speculation,

I think he will be neutral with a clause like elrond where he can pay for something of all spheres (maybe attachments)

If you really want to take that road then there are plenty of examples in both the Hobbit and LotR where Gandalf takes up arms and starts smashing in heads.

Not that I´m a fan of a Gandalf hero to begin with.

Yes, Ana is a tester.  As am I!

 

I am leaking the stats here and now.  Soak them up, peoples of Later Middle-Earth!!!

 

Threat: X + Y + Z + 4

Willpower: X

Attack: Y

Defense: Z

HP: 4

Abilities: X = 1, unless the owner is wearing a wizard hat, in which case X = 4.

              Y = 1, unless the owner is carrying a wizard staff, in which case Y = 4.

              Z = 1, unless the owner is sporting a wizard beard, in which case Z = 4.

 

              Response: Once per game, prior to the engagement phase, the owner may stand-up and declare, in a loud voice, "You shall not pass!"  Doing so will negate all enemy engagements this round.

No, not a tester. I thought people already knew there was a leak. Somebody was posting names of the expansions here, for instance. I do know but I will not tell, out of respect to the designers. I just wanted to sound a bit mysterious, I guess. And also applaud some of the peoples' guesses (if indeed guesses they are, for I am not the only outsider who knows).

## 69 [Courchevel on May 13, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1083079)

My guess :

 

Gandalf the Grey : 10 threat cost - all printed sphere

2 will/2 att/2 def/4 HP

After Gandalf the Grey receives lethal damages by defending a unique foe, return it to play at the end of the next round as Gandalf the White.

 

Gandalf the White : all printed sphere

4 will/4 att/4 def/4 HP

You cannot start the game with Gandalf the White.

 

This could be made by a card with one side Gandalf the Grey and on the back Gandalf the White ...

Of course, I would doubt myself, had I read this. But if there is a hero Gandalf one day and he combos very well with hero Elrond, you may mark these words as not spoken out of jest. And of course, 4/4/4 is too much for a hero.

Sooo.. perhaps our Potential Gandalf allows for playing attachment and/or events out of any sphere, whereas Elrond allows for the same with allies. Then together they could rule an all-colours deck, basically. That would be interesting. It is just that their joint threat would perhaps be sky-high.

 

And the second possibility to read your words: since Elrond is Lore plus Spirit with Nenya, perhaps Gandalf is Leadership plus his rings grants him tactics (or the other way). 

 

It is fun to guess, even if it is all BS.

I am glad. And bull sh*t it is not. Vilya is the last hint I will give as to the combo I spoke of. I hope I am not hunted down by ffg after this, I feel I am still behaving quite honorably. Raised interest will only raise the sales I feel, if someone reads this and indeed takes interest out of it. I would not be too surprised if we see a preview soon though, when is the Road Darkens supposed to be out? My anticipation of it has only increased since I learnt the content.

I will give you the benefit of the doubt Ana. I believe you! More from the fact that I really want a Gandalf hero! As a side, the next Saga box is Moria, and Gandalf is featured front and center on the box. I suspect he is going to show up in the box in some way.

I havent read this topic line for line so i'm sorry if this has been suggested, but i think (or at least would like) that he will

be a neutral hero BUT at the beginning of the game (or maybe even round) you have to select a sphere for him to represent.

This would maintain his neutral presence in regards to helping the spheres evenly without making resource smoothing a

non-factor

You are not too far but it is actually more clever than that.

alright, so if hes clever and he matches up with Elrond well (especially Vilya) I'd guess that you at the start of the turn or maybe just a once per turn action, you reveal the top card of your deck and whatever sphere that is, thats what Gandalf is for the round.  This would obviously help vilya yet retain what i was trying to guess

 

that is if this isnt just a big goose chase to begin with5

## 89 [DurinIII on May 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1085228)

Therefore he'd slot into any deck spheres you had. It think that would work. Very powerful for monosphere.

If there is one non-saga hero only, guess which sphere it shall be.

But if it is the one (or isn't, depending on which wording on Stand and Fight you prefer), how will it be good enough?

If it is to work with Vilya, without Stargazer or Gildor, it may be the answer.

But not only for the Ring itself, for the hero in the hat as well.

If Gandalf is a hero, he shall at least be 14 of threat, that with 13 of Elrond pretty much leaves Glorfindel to be added for the total of 32: and you have the line-up from the Counsel of Elrond design.

A neutral hero? Stand and Fight initially allowed you to put into play ally of any sphere from the discard pile, then it was erratad so that  you can't bring back neutral allies, implying thatg neutral is not actually a sphere. 

## 96 [DurinIII on May 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1086026)

If indeed Gandalf is a neutral hero, he will be the first of his kind. So the game will pick up a new mechanic with him. What better way to introduce such a mechanic than with the "Hero of them All"' Gandalf!

## 97 [MyNeighbourTrololo on May 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1086181)

Well, it's a bit logical. Previously, all Sagas introduced 4 player card heroes, one of each sphere, but in the Road Darkens we suddenly only get one... Would be very logical if this hero would have some mechanic to fit into any sphere.

## 98 [DurinIII on May 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1086531)

Nice. For some reason I hadn't even thought of neutral based on the hint Ana gave us, but it makes perfect sense. He must have some sort of scrying ability as well.

## 100 [DurinIII on May 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1086571)

Scrying would fit nicely with Gandalf's character. Perhaps his Vilya does the scrying?

## 101 [leptokurt on May 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1086789)

Well, either Gandalf helps Elrond/Vilya, or it's the other way around. Could be some ready effect, additional resources or a boost of Gandalf's stats, as they are obviolsy pretty much low, gieven the hints so far, perhaps even at zero.

## 102 [legolas18 on May 16, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105690-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1086796)

I sure hope that he's not built like Galdriel. Her mechanic is interesting and innovative and it fits her, but it wouldn't fit The Grey Pilgrim.
