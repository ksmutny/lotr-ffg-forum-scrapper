I've been thinking about including Expert Trackers in my decks but am somewhat reluctant.

Has anyone else used this card as of yet and if so how useful has it been?

Also because of the way it is worded can you exhaust a scout or ranger character belonging to any player/deck or only one that is controlled by the cards owner?

I had it in a deck for a while, but it's a tricky one - it never felt like a card I was desperate to have in my hand, although it could clear out a location before questing if you combo with Dunedain Hunter. The 0 cost is nice, and some rangers and scouts are really cheap to drop into play, but I wasn't too blown away by it, to be honest. A nice idea, but unless the enemy is 3 or 4 threat, it seldom clears out anything.

I've seen it played a few times, and it's nice to have, but often too I saw the player using it decide it was more worthwhile to keep characters like a Son of Arnor ready for combat than to exhaust them for this card.  But if you've got a Snowbourn Scout hanging around, no problem.

Ithilien Tracker seems to be the best ally to use this with. 2 cost in-sphere, has an ability that only affects the first enemy that enters play, so if you have more than one copy you can exhaust the unused one to put some progress. I think this card is decent, but I don't think I would include it in a solo deck.

Just today I stumbled on a wonderful synergy between this card and Idraen: engage an enemy, exhaust her to play the card, use the progress to explore a location and then ready her!

This may well be the best way to do it, and a nice idea! Will have to try this soon, it's a really cool idea!

Yeah, Ricedwlit beat me to it, but I have also used the card with Idrean and found it to be amazing.

I've used it a couple times in secrecy decks with Celduin Travelers or Ithilien Lookouts.  It can be useful, but like Grandspleen said I often need the action and can't afford to exhaust anyone.  I could hold back a Celduin Traveler from questing, but most of the time I won't get to use it anyway and now I've just wasted 2 willpower.  Or I could use the Lookout, but I often need them to kill the enemy.

 

So yeah, it's good with Idrean.  Pretty marginal with anyone else.

I've tried to use this card a lot actually.   Love that artwork.   The problem is Asfaloth who is just way better.   With Idraen the problem is not really readying her,  she's easy to ready with this card, or Asfaloth, or the Riddermark's finest,  or just by having a lot of willpower.   The problem I always run into with Idraen is giving her things to do.  Probably because I only really play multiplayer,  she doesn't have ranged or sentinel,  and its very hard to give her these without sacrificing your ability to ready her.

Wow, didn't even think of using it with Idraen, that's brilliant.

Let's house rule it: place 2X progress instead if the character is both a Scout AND a Dunedain :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yeah, I had played it with Idraen also. But it was about the only real good combo in the whole deck. The rangers feel very under-developed as of yet. Mind though that I was playing pure theme: rangers and nothing else. But really, Idraen is great with Expert Trackers: more often than not I was able to clear a location in the staging area for the cost of the event alone, no resource spent, no characters exhausted.

It doesn't reads "you control", so it might be pretty useful in multiplayer.

But exhausting is part of the cost so you can only exhaust your own characters for it regardless.

> But exhausting is part of the cost so you can only exhaust your own characters for it regardless.

Then what the point of some cards having the "exhaust a character you control" type effect, while other don't?

That is part of the ongoing inconsistency in wording of this game. It is a shame really because it makes even the most veteran players doubtful about the rules sometimes, haha.

Why this one specifies that you must control the Silvan ally in question, and Expert Trackers doesn't? Both are pretty recent cards.

Because you CAN, in principle, return other player's allies into their hand (for example, see Meneldor's Flight) but you CANNOT exhaust an ally that is not under your own control.

If the card says you can do it, you can do it.  At present there are no cards that allow you to exaust other player's characters, I think, but there is no reason they couldn't make one in the future.

 

If not otherwise specified, you can't pay a "cost" with other players' assets.  You have to use those that are under your control.  So yes,"Return an ally you control to your hand" is redundant, and "Exhaust a character you control is also redundant."  The first part of those cards (all the words that come before the word "to") is the "cost," so unless the card explicitly states otherwise it has to be paid with your own cards/resources.

GrandSpleen, I generally agree with what you are saying and I actually don't want to go into nitty-gritty rule discussions but... what makes you think that the words before "is" are part of the cost of a card? I don't think that's true and hence the "you control" phrase is not redundant on The Three People. (On a side note, if the card text said "do X to Y", then yes it would be part of the cost as per the "paying costs" paragraph in the rule book, page 25.)

Common Cause, Hands Upon the Bow, Helm! Helm!, Late Adventurer, Quick Strike, Rain of Arrows, Ravens of the Mountain - all have that wording. And Helm! Helm! is a very recent card to have that sort of "mistake".

Not sure why you would call these mistakes. Redundancy can be very helpful and, going back to topic, if the text on Expert Tracker had explicitly mentioned "you control" too, you would not have misinterpreted it in the first place.

## 27 [John Constantine on June 22, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180835-expert-trackers-have-you-used-it-and-how-useful-has-it-been/?do=findComment&comment=1668361)

I simply do not understand the different wording for the same effect. If the game rules dictate that you may never exhaust/discard/etc. other player's cards by your card effects, no card of that kind should EVER read "you control". Or, alternatively, they all should read "you control". Not random half of them.

When an enemy makes an additional attack, it always gets a shadow card.  Many older enemy cards had a parenthetical, "deal a shadow card for this attack."  Also redundant.  It is what it is.  Write a letter to the developers if you feel strongly about it.

Yes, "many older". Emphasis on "older", yet we have this kind of wording on Helm! Helm!. No letters written to the developers transform text on the existing cards.

Yes. You know what does? Being consistent in your cards texts as a game designer.

 

I want you to aknowledge that the wording currently used is wrong and an act of poor writted card text consistency. And to stop defending it, at least.

I think we all agree it is redundant and inconsistent but the intent is clear (as defined by whether or not an FAQ response is required).  I'm not sure what else you are looking for.  Whether you think that makes the card wrong and/or poorly written is subjective.  It seems pretty typical to me.  Not as well written as Magic, but better than the Pathfinder Adventure Card Game or anything you'll get from Kickstarter.  I don't know how it compares to other FFG LCGs.

It is annoying that wording on cards differs and is not consistent however I messaged Caleb and then realised when he replied it is indeed outlined in the core set rules booklet so is pretty clear:

"Many cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do Y” manner. When confronted with such a construct, everything before the word “to” is considered the cost, and everything after the word “to” is considered an effect. Costs can only be payed with cards or resources that a player controls. If an effect is canceled, the cost is still considered to have been paid."

(taken directly from core set rulebook under "paying costs")

 

Caleb's response:

Hi Gello,

You can only exhaust characters you control to pay the cost for an event you play.
Cheers,
Caleb
