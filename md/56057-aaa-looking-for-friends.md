Anyone can add me. I've just started adding new scores since the change.

 I've just sent you an invite.

 

I am also interested in finding out how the new scoring system works for other people, so everybody feel free to add me. Thanks.

Yep, added you 3 as well. Feel free to add me. I've been comparing scores and weights with a couple friends but the more the merrier!

I enjoy comparing quest scores.  I've only posted one score since the change, but I'll get more up as I play more games.  I usually play multi-player right now.

Any of you can add me for comparisons as well.

I'm down as well! I thought no one else had posted scores yet with the new scoring system. I've got an handful in there.

## 10 [gamestar10 on November 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56057-aaa-looking-for-friends/?do=findComment&comment=554275)

OK, I've added all to this post. Thanks all! This is going to be good.

 Go ahead and add me I had quite a few of the old scores in but haven't had much of a chance to play since the new scoring system.  I've been busy with midterms and such but hopefully can start playing more, just tried dead marshes tonight for the first time its pretty fun!

## 12 [gamestar10 on November 10, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56057-aaa-looking-for-friends/?do=findComment&comment=554278)

Lucky. Mine comes tomorrow...

This is a great idea, everyone may feel free to add me. Don't have many games registered since the new scoring system came up, but this will change the next weeks
