Hello. I'm new to the game and unsure about the rules. I just realised that Elrond can summon any ally regardless of sphere, which got me thinking… Attachments and events etc with 0 resource requirement to summon - do they even require a hero to be summoned?

For example - I have a [spirit] attachment card in my deck, but only [Leadership] and [Lore] heroes. The cost to summon the attachment is 0, so I don't have to use resources from a [spirit] hero pool. Do I still need a [spirit] hero in play? Thanks.

What do you mean summon?  Elrond can use his resources to PAY for allies of any sphere…he can use the ring to "summon" anything.  Things that cost 0 require a hero in play under your control to have the matching sphere.  Once you get Vilya on Elrond, he now has both the lore and spirit spheres and you can play the 0 cost spirit cards for free.    Although as a read core book page 27 para3 last sentence:   "A player should also make sure that all the cards in his deck belong to a sphere that matches at least one of his heroes' resource icons, lest he find himself with a dead card he cannot hope to play."  I don't like that wording at all.  It seems like including cards with a mis matched sphere would qualify as an illegal deck….or did this statement get an errata or are the players just supposed to take it as common sense that FFG means that unless the heroes can gain the matching sphere during the game "…lest he find himself with a dead card …"

They just mean you might end up holding a card that you can't legally play.  Like what happens to me every time I get forced to discard my only copy of Song of Battle in my tri-color deck with Tactics splash.

As for paying for 0-cost cards, that's covered in the game manual: pg. 12: "Cards with a cost of zero do not require a resource to be spent in order to pay their cost, but they do require at least one hero under that player’s control to have a resource icon that matches the card’s sphere."

Yeah, I mean pay not summon. Cool, now I understand how it works. Thanks.
