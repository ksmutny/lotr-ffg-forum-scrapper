I was hoping for an announcement/preview yesterday. Hope we get it soon.

## 2 [richsabre on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=607787)

they dont really stick to it anymore, they havnt seemed to for about 2 months now

I know I should have patience. I just thought they announced the preview of the New Hero a week ago, so I was hoping that be yesterday. It may as well be tomorrow now. Looking forward! I hope it is Elladan but I hope he is not "that" similar to Elrohir.

## 4 [richsabre on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=607794)

im not sure but for some reason i think thursday for the preview? dont know where i get that from.....anyways this will be elladan

threat 10

willpower 2

attack 1

defense 2

while elrohir is in play elladan get +2 attack

not sure, but  i reckon he ll be able to ready himself like elrohir

 

it would have been cool if they did something like- when (elladan or elrohir) leaves play, decrease (elladan or elrohirs) defense to 0 and add the same number to his attack for the rest of the game

 

sort of to show the anger and grief at losing a brother

It would be interesting if the Hero wasn't Elladan!

## 6 [richsabre on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=607817)

as much as i like card surprises i really want him to a be a hero, it would annoy me if he was an ally and you have to actually wait for elrohir to be of any use

of course you cant take his artwork on the box as anything- could be a haldir thing going on

## 7 [Bomb on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=607830)

I actually think he will be A Hero, but my comment was on basically an attempt to destroy the hopes that he is actually in the next AP!

## 8 [lleimmoen on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=607848)

I think they are not going to have us waiting even longer for Elrohir to be of any real use. Even though, as I said, I have little hope of him being of any REAL use with the stats and ability he has been given. So I am just (foolishly) hoping Elladan won't be a reverse copy of Elrohir because then I just cannot see myself justifying them on a team.

That's not true at all. They've had articles on 5 out of the last 7 Mondays. That's pretty consistant in my book. The only time they don't have a Monday article is when they have another article in the week, usually announcing the release of a new adventure pack.

Look, I'm as addicted to Monday news as anybody but let's just relax guys. The reason they didn't have an article yesterday is because someday this week (probably tomorrow or Thursday) they're going to announce the release of Rivendell and have the preview of Elladan in that article. Trust me.

i wasnt getting wound up- i was just stating that they dont do it as consistently as they used to....i remember a time when it used to run like clock work- and it certainly isnt that anymore- and that is true

i refer of course to khazad dum when around christmas we were left in the dark for god knows how long

## 11 [Drengi on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=607905)

Im kinda hoping it isnt Elladan!

 

 Despite never using them I would like another Hobbit so I can run a team of three of them! Nice low threat, decent crad draw with decent allies deck :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

ha! it actually wasnt- did even realise till you said

## 14 [lleimmoen on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608024)

One should not be that honest. I thought it was, and it was brilliant. Well it is nonetheless.

## 15 [richsabre on March 20, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608031)

haha thanks................................

## 16 [lleimmoen on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608302)

I am thankful to ffg for producing this lovely game.

But, what a terrible advertising really on this pack, they say they will preview a hero, and then they don't make it before the pack hits the stores (not mine). And the announcement that it is out seems also a bit odd now that several people already have it and post about it. If you visit the site you will know it is out without them telling you. Do not quite understand this strategy.

## 17 [richsabre on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608324)

didnt know they had annonouced it was out yet? the latest preview is still the one saying it is coming out soon.....yeah i see what you're saying, when khazad dum came out, that was a few days before ffg announced it, still.......makes no difference to europe as it takes 2 weeks to get here

## 18 [lleimmoen on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608337)

I meant some people claimed they have got the package on either this or bgg page, so there seems little need to announce it is out, I would find more logic in saying "it will be out ..." a few days before it actually is. This seems like the evening weather forecast for the morning past. I am not trying to make a big deal out of this banality though...

## 19 [richsabre on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608341)

i agree with you it is rather strange, i mean they have to release the packs so its not like they dont know theyre gone!

## 20 [richsabre on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608475)

..........................................there we go...all up....

## 21 [Bomb on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608492)

I am interesting in knowing what all the new Hero deck cards are outside of that Ebay listing we had taken a gander at.  Can anyone list them here?

## 22 [lleimmoen on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608495)

The info is on bgg... No more pictures as of yet.

## 23 [richsabre on March 21, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62086-no-news-on-monday/?do=findComment&comment=608545)

im sorry but this is starting to really irritate me, thats 3 cards now in 2 packs that are f-ing useless to a solo player- the new song attactments sounded awesome - but its yet another drinks coaster that goes along with renewed friendship or the new rohan ally

yes come on, start complaining against me, but hell, seeing as you only get what 9 new cards per pack? and 2 of those are useless

ive contacted ffg to see if we're gonna get some solo love, and will post their reply

You saw the other 4 cards?  I can seem to still only find 5 of them.  Maybe I'm missing the location of them on boardgamegeeks.com with the other hero deck cards.

I just checked BBG as well and couldn't find all the cards. I guess there's nothing for it but to go buy the darn pack!

Your post, richsabre, prompted me to look at the bgg thread on those cards (curse you mailman for being late with my AP!) and yeah that is troubling. At least the spirit ally is not useless solo, unlike the song which loses its best effect when solo. Here's hoping you get an actual response from FFG. I'm curious of what they have to say.
