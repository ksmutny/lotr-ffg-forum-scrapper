Well, I reeeally like the set icon symbol, very scary ^^

The scenario sounds interesting and I hope that they always keep the adventures varied in themes and challenges. I do have one question though. I don't understand Durin's Helm. Will a dwarf hero gets +2 hitpoints AND +1 defense or only the +2 hitpoints?

 I'd say both

Otherwise, it'd need to be "non-dwarves get..." "dwarves get..." and that would just get complicated.

Both. Any hero can wear the helm and get +1 defense. A Dwarf hero will get +1 defense and +2 health. Durin's Helm will look good on Gloin, or can turn Dain into an absolutely impregnable wall of a defender.

So, I believe the Redhorn Gate will only be available after the sixth AP of Dwarrowdelf (assuming there will be 'only' six).
I shouldn't have bought the Redhorn Gate together with the Khazad-dum deluxe expansion, it seems I'll only see those two near March.

 

Hmm, well. I'm not excited as others to see those two encounter cards, except for the fact that sabre already covered: Suck that Zigil 5-6 Deck.

 

What I really want to see is the new player cards, to see if the cards we are getting are good enough for my Elves!

im actually getting more tired of waiting than for hfg release, theres a point when the excitment goes and you just want it to be released already..

I did not ordered from FFG sonrojado.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sonrojado.gif] (assuming you did, obviously).
Also, my Country has absurd taxes upon games and foreign mail, so I am not willing to pay the sending twice. :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]

 

Do you have any idea of when they will launch Redhorn Gate? I mean, ANY idea at all would be good; they say 'Available Soon' at the products session, but is that way since last week IIRC.

Khaz only just came out.. I am still playing Mirkwood cycle!! FFG releases things way to fast for me to play as is...

The Dwarrowdelf Cycle is shaping up to be really awesome with each and every preview! Looks like the promise of "some of the nastiest encounter cards to date appear in this cycle" is true. The idea of turning up general useful stuff in the encounter deck is a good one, I've been waiting for something like this since all that athelas in Rhosgobel.

That we've only seen 5 of the presumed 54 player cards from these five packs (if the Mirkwood format is adhered to) makes me wonder just what is in store there. I still hope for an Elrond ally in the mould of Gandalf, anyway...

About Elder Nameless Thing. So how much will the value of cost x cards be, 4 or 0?

no i ordered from a uk company, but i see you point about the cost of splitting

i do not think it is possible to estimate release times anymore since khazads delay, my stores are about a month off with their estimates now- according to them rivendell will be released probably around the time of rehorn- which isnt gonna happen

Good question. But I think it's been established already that cost X always equals 0 for the purposes of other effects. So you would get a break in that case.
