Okay, so I got two Goblin snipers in the staging area and just played Son of Anor in my planing phase. So, does his special ability work to pull down and engage one of the to Goblin Snipers in the staging area? I would guess so since the sniper states that you can't optionally engage him during the encounter phase. But wanna be sure.

yes that would work fine i think

...the other sniper in khazad dum i dont think it would work on though, as it says cannot be engaged

No. The card says "Players cannot optionally engage Goblin Archer." It will engage normally at 48 and Andor's ability will work on it.
