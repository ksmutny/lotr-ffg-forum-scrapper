Hey All,

Can anyone please tell me how many Player, Encounter and Quest Cards are in the KD Box. I just want to make sure I have enough sleeves.

15 new player cards.... 2 heroes... so um... 28 new player cards total. This expantion is all about the encounter cards.. there is like 8 encounter sets or somthing.. I guess so future APs have more options.

I'm confused by the maths here - are the 15 player cards not all 3x - is it some weird core-set style distribution? otherwise can't see how you get to 28.
