 Tonight; me and my roommate finally beat Shadow & Flame for the first time after i've personally attempted the quest about 10 times.  It was so ridiculously satisfying.  I used a new dwarf deck with Thorin, Ori, and Nori while my roomate used  a decent Tactics/Spirit build of mine with Legolas, Frodo, and Glorfindel.  We avoided having the Balrog attack us for the first 3 turns with a  combination of Nori's awesome effect (especially for this quest) and my roomates lucky draws of Elrond's counsel and Greeting of the Galadrium.  By the time Durin's bane finally attack we both had chump blockers to spare while i had a Erebor Battlemaster wielding a ~7 attack and he had a beefed up Legolas with two Rivendell Blades.  We sent the Balrog back into the pit the first turn we traveled to it and had some help from the encounter deck by not encountering any Cave Trolls or other particularly nasty encounter cards that we couldnt easily overcome.

anyone else have any good memories from the first time they beat this brutal quest?
