Yes, the quest is called "The Stone of Erech".

 

Explore the Hill of Erech and confront the spectral hordes of the Dean Men of Dunharrow in an exclusive new Quest.

 

There were three events listed at 40 players per event.  All three are sold out!  Event registration was only open since Sunday. WOW!

 

I bought the last ticket available for the last event listing.  Its a 2 player event so I could not even get one from my regular player partner.
