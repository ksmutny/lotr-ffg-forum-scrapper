I am definitely getting two core sets. I play with a group of friends that play RPGs a lot, full decks are going to be important. (None of us have started collecting LoR the card game)

 

So, after the core sets I have about $60 left over to spend. What else should I get? I really want to do the proper progression.

 

Thanks all in advance,

Yep. That's also where I started, with this article. I boght the AP from the first cycle, and, later, Khaza Dum, and so on.

I have to add that progression play is something i love.

I have jyst finished the mirkwood first cycle on progression and started the pod osgilliath scenario before I go to kazad dum and although i now own every product for this game, i wouldnt play ut any other way (initially) than progression.

Dont let the difficulty of 2/3 if core scenarios put you off as the game is awesome.

Ive played games for over 30 years including things firm TSR, Games Workshop, d&d, card games and pretty much most things, yet ive never played a game with as much variety, scope and diversity as this game and it can be played PROPERLY solo (not sone butchered solo version of the rules) so you can even play it more often.

Its truly awesome welcome to the game!!!

If you have limited money you probably won't be able to buy the entire card pool, so playing progression would keep you from the awesome new packs. I would suggest going for the Lord of the Rings Saga boxes starting with Black Riders, as they provide great quests and good player cards in each one.
