Hey everybody just have a few questions about this quest.

1. Do you discard creatures that were in play before 3b has been revealed? (Either ones that were engaged with you or still in the staging area)

2. If you are playing a 2 player game and 1 player losses all his hero's, does the the player that is alive need to travel to the dead players staging area?

Thanks for the help!

1) Yeah, you discard all encounter cards and that includes any locations or enemies in play, and that Watchful Eyes treachery if it is attached to one of your heroes also.

 

2) Not sure about this one.  I'm not aware of any existing firm answer.  You could either discard all of that player's encounter cards, or you could have all those encounter cards join up with the first player during the next travel phase (as if the quest card had been defeated).  Without an official answer I suppose it's your call on how you want to play it.

2) Yeah, I'm not aware of an official ruling either, but I think they would just get discarded.  It doesn't meet the criteria for "joining another player" so I don't think you do that.  And you can't join another player that doesn't exist...

I was just playing Breaking of the Fellowship today.  That is another scenario in which players split up into separate staging areas.  In the rules for that, it says that when a player is eliminated, you discard that stage and all the encounter cards in it.  This is a different scenario, but I would follow those rules when playing Foundations of Stone.
