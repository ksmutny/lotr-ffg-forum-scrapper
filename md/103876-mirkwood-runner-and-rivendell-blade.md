Mirkwood Runner already ignores an enemy's defence when attacking alone. I'm guessing giving him a Rivendell Blade (which brings down an enemy's defense by 2) does not stack and lets him do even more damage? Feels like you cannot have negative def.

I am fairly certain that zero is the absolute zero. If not then citadel custodian would get a little out if hand.

No, no, no. It is in the core set rules, that if any stat goes under 0, it is considered to be 0.

Yeah, that should be obvious, but sometimes game designers barf.......
