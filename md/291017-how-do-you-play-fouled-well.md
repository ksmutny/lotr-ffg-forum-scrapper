Fouled Well reads: "When Revealed: Each player may choose and discard 1 card at random from his hand. If all players did not discard 1 card, Fouled Well gains Surge."

I interpret this as "if at least one player randomly discards a card, surge will not happen". Is this correct?

No, there is no randomness in *choose*. Edit: oh dear. Played it wrong all the time!

Also, I am not a native english speaker, so I do have some issues with the second part. Translated it means "each player has to discard a card or surge", but there would be easier and more elegant ways to describe this. Additionally, I think it does not make much sense, from the games perspective: either all or none player will discard a card then. So I suppose it should have ment: "If not at least one player discarded a card then surge". But that is definitly not the result if translated.

No, all the players have to discard 1 card so that it does not gain Surge. Basically it's an all or nothing.

I asked Caleb about this and he confirmed, all players have to discard a random card. Since this is not, how I interpret the current text, I will errata my copies to: "If any player discarded no card, Fouled Well gains Surge."
