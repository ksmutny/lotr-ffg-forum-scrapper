So far in the Ring-Maker cycle we have seen two silvan allies that cost 2 (one lore and one leadership) and three silvan events that cost 0.

 

Many have speculated that this means there will also be a fourth 0 cost event in the leadership sphere (lore, spirit and tactics have been spoiled) as well as two other 2 cost allies in the spirit and tactics sphere (leadership has been spoiled and lore has been partially spoiled).

 

What do you think the fourth event will do?

What do you think the other two allies will do?
What do you think the partially spoiled lore ally actually does?

 

I'm hoping the 2 cost silvan tactics ally has 2 attack, has ranged (really hope it has ranged) and a useful ability. Reduce your threat by 1 every time this character participates in an attack that destroys an enemy would be amazing. I doubt it will be something like this even though the game has been needing some sort of threat reduction in tactics since the start. Regardless of ability I will be using this new ally as long as it has ranged instead of Westfold Outrider (the only real time I ever use Westfold's ability is against Bill Ferny and he can be easily dealt with in other ways) as ranged is amazing in two player/two handed and will also boost Rumil's ability.

The two cost lore silvan ally, Galadhrim Minstrel, has "your deck for AN" which means it can't be silvan ally or song, do you think this will be attachment, event or ally?
No idea what the spirit silvan ally will do...
Thoughts?

I know I've started a few threads speculating on what new ring maker cycle cards will do but its all I can do while I wait for more spoilers and dunland trap to come out...

It would make sense for the leadership recycling silvan event to give the player resources.  Maybe return a silvan ally then give a hero 2 resources, or they could even have u gain the number of resources that the ally costed which gives it a variable effect kind of how the tactics and spirit ones are.  Wouldnt be surprised if i'm wrong at all though.

 

Allies are too hard to guess, i'll enjoy the surprise i suppose

Returning Rumil or Orophin to your hand to gain 4/3 resources would be pretty **** good, then you can play them again with those resources and trigger their enters play response again or use the resources for other cards obviously. That would be a pretty awesome card!

For the leadership event, 'Return a silvan ally to your hand, then you may play a silvan ally with equal or less cost from your hand'. What do you think? It's technically resource generation, it's just a forced spend.

Also, the AN issue, 'search your deck for an.... ally with the silvan trait then blah blah'. It still could be silvan ally. I've seen cards with this wording layout before, I just can't remember which card. Mechanically I think it will be silvan ally. There aren't many yet and you'll need to get them early to start your 'bouncing' in and out of play trick.

As for the other allies, aside from the spheres core role, I have no idea at all. Silvan is totally new and the few examples already present don't give any hints.

It seems pretty clear to me that Galadhrim Minstrel searches the top five cards for an event, which will be very strong.

If we went by the past, Tactics ally could do direct damage whilst Spirit reduce threat.

Leadership event is much harder to guess.

And yes, Tactics ally 0 will, 2 attack, 1 defense, 1 hp; Spirit ally 2 will, 0 attack, 1 defense, 1 hp; Lore ally 1 will, 0 attack, 0 defense, 1 hp (as the ability is super strong).

Yeah, safe bets would probably be on Tactics ally doing damage and Spirit reducing your threat.

 

The leadership event is a little harder to predict. Sometimes Leadership has a smattering of non-sphere typical abilities. Could be something that readies allies, gives resources, deals with shadow cards, cancels attacks, etc.

I really hope the tactics ally has 2 health....1 just sucks

1 hp is pretty much a safe bet for these cheap allies. Even Rúmil, cost 4, and Orophin, cost 3, both unique, obviously, only have 2 hp.

I think Lleimmoen just forgot Ranged with the Tactics ally, otherwise the stats guess makes total sense.

PsychoRocka, I think you underestimate Westfold Outrider greatly, he seems super great to me. You can pull an enemy after the enemies attacked to attack it without defending. Of course Feint works better in a way, but this guy can do other things as well, and he combos excellently with Horn of Gondor, Imrahil, Éomer.

Yeah I know how good he is, but a ranged tactics ally will help Rumil and two handed play in general and it would also help make my decks more thematic (More Elves rather than random Rohan allies). Don't use Horn or those heroes.

He is a great ally though don't get me wrong! I just really hope the silvan tactics ally is good enough to replace him!

Yeah you're probably right =(

Orophin costs 3 not 2 by the way

Of course, a typo.

Of course, I would not put the Outrider into an Elven deck. I was just noting my satisfaction with him in Rohan/Gondor decks.

And yeah, I think you shan't be disappointed with the Silvan Tactics ally, it seems they're all gonna be pretty great.
