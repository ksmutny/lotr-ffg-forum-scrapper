 Does anyone use tokens to mark why a character was/is exhausted?  I have not had a hard time keeping track yet, but thought it might be useful to avoid confusion.  

Just a thought...

Doesnt seem worth it.

I just slide the characters questing slightly forward, then bring them back when the questing is done.

No real need to mark characters attacking / defending as this happens one character at a time.
