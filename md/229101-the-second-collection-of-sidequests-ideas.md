The new collection of those kinda of sidequests has a new limitation: limit 1 in victory display (the first collection was limit 1 in deck). The effects of these cards are very strong. We have 3 spoilers of it: neutral, tactics, and lore...what you think about the text of the leadership and spirit ones?

My votes for:

leadership -> The first enemy engaged each round gives a resource to a hero controlled of the player is engaging to.

spirit -> Ready a character with less willpower than the threat of the enemy just revealed. Limit once per round.

Leadership likely has some kind of resource acceleration, but giving every play an extra resource seems really strong, so i think it will likely reduce the cost of the first ally played each round by each player by 1. that's effectively extra resources but conditional

Spirit i think has something to do with the discard pile. playing a card from the discard, shuffling one back in, etc.
i can't think of a balanced ability that has to do with threat, but that's a likely fit for it (i'm sure the developers came up with a good idea though)

as for these new side quests, i too like them a lot.

It wold be cool to have a side quest that deals with Conditions.

The Spirit one could be something Surge related, like "Response: After a card with Surge is revealed, resolve its Surge effect and then discard that card (limit once per round)."

Neat idea would be a spirit side quest that once defeated and in the victory display gains: "Discard a unique ally to cancel the when revealed effects of an encounter card. Any player may trigger this effect. (limit once per round)"

 

Expensive treachery cancellation that you can only use once per turn.

Might be way too strong but a cool idea.

That'd be insane with Caldara, Psyckorocka.

Hadn't thought of that...
If it wasn't for her it would be fine. I hate that the designers of the game now have to be extremely careful and make sure new cards don't exacerbate or strengthen the overpowered combos that exist or create entirely new ones... 

super frustrating for those of us not interested in OP or broken combos...

We have no less than three other spirit heroes who are capable of discarding for benefit, not to mention self-sacrificing Rohirrim and discard-for-benefit spirit Noldor cards.  Getting spirit allies into the discard is not at all a problem and the proposed side-quest would make no appreciable difference to the maximum power level of Caldara decks.  However, it would make possible a *weaker* Caldara deck, one that doesn't rely on Arwen/Cirdan/Eowyn to populate the discard, but allows when revealed cancellation to build up a later Caldara sacrifice, if needed.

It wouldn't be overpowered for giving you another way to discard allies, it would be overpowered by giving you a way to cancel when revealed effects every singe round.

Even without Caldara, you could have Emery or Ioreth acting as not only free allies, but emergency When Revealed cancellation. I think the designers are already frustrated enough at the existence of Test of Will, so I doubt they will go down this route.

 

I have no idea what kind of passive effect will be on the spirit side quest. Maybe +1 willpower for heroes? Probably too boring...

or after a card with surge is revealed each player may ready a questing character/ally they control (limit once per round).

Spirit side-quest:

Cost: 1

Quest Points: 6

Limit 1 copy of this quest in the victory display.

While this quest is in the victory display, each ally with printed willpower 1 or less gets +1 willpower.

 

Leadership side-quest:

Cost: 1

Quest Points: 6

Limit 1 copy of this quest in the victory display.

While this quest is in the victory display, it gains: "Action: Ready any character. (Limit once per round.)".

Interesting, John, your side-quests make me think about their possibilities.

 

Another idea about the text of the spirit one: "Response: the first ally defeated this round, can be returned to the hand of their controller".

If it is leadership: "Response: the first ally defeated this round, can be returned to the hand of any player".

How about this:

Our Way or the High Way

Cost: 4 Resources

12 Progress

You must pay resources from 4 different spheres to play Our Way or the High Way.

While this quest is in victory display you can ignore "immune to player card effects" and "cannot be cancelled" on the encounter cards, as well as "indestructible" keyword.

 

Tho i dont think i would like to see this card in the game, actually.

For the Greater Good

Spirit Side Quest

Cost: 3

Progress: 30

Forced: After this quest is cleared, owner of this quest is eliminated. Each other player wins the game.
