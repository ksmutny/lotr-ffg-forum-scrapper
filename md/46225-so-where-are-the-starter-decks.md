The manual talks about a bunch of starter decks to try out as a new player... but I can not see any deck lists in the manual for these starter decks....

Where can I find the starter deck card lists so i can build these decks?

It's pretty simple. There are four starter decks. Each one has a color. Just take all the cards of the same color and you got the deck. The Manual says you can also throw Gandalf in, what you should do by the way. When you have the deck, take the three corresponding heroes for that color, they have the same color, and you are ready to go.

Rulebook p10 gives the card numbers for each starter deck, it's pretty clearly stated

I would suggest throwing in 2-3 Gandalf cards, if you can. There are four copies total in the box, and it seems like such a waste to leave so many sitting in there, and not to play with as many as possible.

Well you can also mix them up for multicolor. But it's better to begin with mono so that you know what each color stands for.
