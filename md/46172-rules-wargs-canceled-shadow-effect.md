# [[Rules] Wargs + canceled shadow effect](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46172-rules-wargs-canceled-shadow-effect/)

 Hi,

I haven't read about this in any thread so I create a new one. Sorry if this has been debated somewhere else.

 

- If I cancel the shadow effect of the shadow card dealt to the Wargs thanks to Hasty Stroke for example, is the shadow card considered "with no effect". Conclusion, should they return to the SA after their attack or not ?

If a power cancels the shadow effect of a card I´d say that you should ignore all text in the shadow area of the card in question. Which would also include placing the warg in the SA which is part of the shadow effect

 No, placing the Wargs in the SA is part of the Wargs forced effect, not of the shadow card.

The Wargs say " If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect, return Wargs to the staging area after it attacks."

The shadow card had an effect, but it was cancelled.

Everything before the "," :  "If Wargs is dealt a shadow card with no effect".  If they are dealt a shadow card that does have an effect, then they stay engaged no matter what happens during the following phases.

I would keep them engaged with the player because they were dealt a shadow card that had an effect. Even though you cancelled the effect, it was still on the card when it was dealt.

 

 

I'm not 100% sure on this, but this is how I'm interpreting it.

Yes they would stay engaged as the card did have an effect, it was just canceled.
