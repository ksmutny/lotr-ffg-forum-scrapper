Cards have to be played in specific decks so that they have resources to be played with. Does this mean that 0 cost cards- i.e. Stand together, Common Cause, can be played in any deck even without heroes from the spheres they belong to?

Mighty Jim said:

Cards with a cost of zero do not require a resource to be
spent in order to pay their cost, but they do require
at least one hero under that player’s control to have a
resource icon that matches the card’s sphere.

Ok, hadn't spotted that. Thanks for pointing it out folks.

Still seems a bit odd to me- I'd have liked them to have put in some more explanation about the rationale behind this.

Probably to maintain the sphere theme with the 0 cost cards.  Otherwise, all zero cards might as well have been neutral.
