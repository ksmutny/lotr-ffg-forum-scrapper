I don’t know what you’d with them in a card game, but neat.

Probably quite good for Arkham Horror LCG for their miniature investigator cards.

With regard to LotR, maybe of use in the Mysterious Island adventures in the Dreamchaser Cycle?

If only the stands provided in Mansions of Madness were clear. The default ones cover up sooo much of the lovely artwork.
