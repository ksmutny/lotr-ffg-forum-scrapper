# [Expecting Mischief and Grip Grab! Pinch, Nab shadow question hobbit 2](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72130-expecting-mischief-and-grip-grab-pinch-nab-shadow-question-hobbit-2/)

1st Question Does the card Expecting Mischief work like Thalin’s ability to cancel Surge and even When Revealed actions? (like with A Suspicious Crow) Side note to this question I am playing if the card A Suspicious Crow makes you get a card from the discard pile and it has its own when revealed action I’m applying it also)





 

2nd Question The shadow effect on Grip Grab Pinch Nab Do you still count the other characters shield when delivering the extra damage? Like if you have to deliver 6 points and use up 3 and kill one character when you move to the next and he has 2 shields and 2 health you still use the shields and only deliver one wound. Also you couldn’t give 6 characters one wound each?

 Regarding 1st question: Since the card is worded in a similar way to Thalin's ability (Deal x damage to … enemy revealed … ) I've been playing that it works the same way.

 Thanks for the reply. Yea that's the way i've been playing it just wanted to confirm with someone. I've been using Denethor and Expecting Mischief and finally won hobbit 2. My other hero's were Gimli and Glorfindel. No spirit so the game has to be played in about 15 turns unless Gandolf comes in to save the day.

regarding 2- when dealing actual damage you never take into account defense, as to the other i dont see why you couldnt give one wound each?

 Shadow: Defending player deals damage among characters he controls equal to the number of Goblin enemies with him.

 

So yes I see now you deal the damage out disregarding the shields but you can spread it out the way you want. I have to remember to read the text very carefully. Thanks Rich. Sorry about the dumb question but still playing and enjoying the game. I only have the core set Kaza Dum and the hobbit. I was thinking about going right into this new saga expansion with the new city seige. Was wondering if the new mechanics would make the earlier expansion cards not as useful. And save my money for the new expansion and sets that will come after it.

no worries happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]

as for the packs, its hard to say- i mean alot of the core cards such as the songs are in the very first cycle - shadows of mirkwood, so you are missing them, and theres also some very very powerful noldor cards (not to mention dwarves) in the dwarrowdelf cycle

how this will affect playability is hard to say, hiers of numenor seems very different in mechanics to the previous ones, but without it being out its hard to say what effect, if any it wil have on the cards.

i dont think theres reason to skip it- remember you need the major pack to buy and play the small 6 that come after it- so if you give hiers of numenor a miss then it will be some time (not counting the last hobbit pack) before there is an entire new cycle

 No I wasn't going to skip the new expansion Numenor, I was just wondering if it was a good starting point what with the new mechanics. Instead of buying the earlier packs. New players may be interested where they can start or is it best to start from the Mirkwood cycle and then the Dwarrowdelf. I know I know just buy them all right! But there so much I want to buy what with the new Halo coming out and Gears of War Judgement. I own the board game its great by the way. You can play solo.

i see ….well i think it depends on what you want and how quickly you can buy them….i would say buy them in order..this was the intended design order and so the difficulty scales that way. there are also some key cards early on which will make the games later on more balanced.

although it probably wont make much difference, there are some great cards in both of them

take a look on cardgamedb.com and see which cards are in which pack, this may help you decide
