So I have posted about this over at BGG as well but just did not get enough of a response for it to move forward.  I am going to try and organize a Central Texas (or anywhere else nearby if you are willing to travel) event once monthly where LOTR LCG fans can meet up and play.  I would like to start by doing a progression style run through of all the quests out there but am open to ideas.  I love this game but almost always wind up playing solo as there are not many players looking for groups in Austin (at least that I know of).

Count me in!

A few of us have been meeting at Dragons Lair every Wednesday for the past few months. Two of us have even started planning to play a saga campaign- figuring by the time we're through Black Riders the next box should be hitting shelves.

You're welcome to join!

A progression series also sounds fun

Well I'm in South Central Texas (San Antonio) and we don't have a lot of players at our Dragon's Lair AFAICT.  Stil, feel free to let me know when/where you are going to meet.  I'd like to be in the loop.

I was thinking Austin might be the best place to meet up as it is pretty central and has more open gaming than Waco or San Antonio (although that could be ignorance as far as San Antonio as I have only looked online).  I live north of Austin but can get there pretty easily with notice.  How would Saturday evenings work for everyone?

Saturday, April 12 will be a LotR event at Dragons Lair Austin at 6pm. We'll be trying out the new nightmare packs, the first scenario of Over Hill and Under Hill. You thought those troll sacks were bad before!

 

Start time: 6pm

 

 

Also, two of us are starting the BR campaign on Wednesday nights.

Awesome, would you need me to bring any encounter sets?

BR = The Black Riders saga expansion, which introduced campaign mode.

Thanks to Steven and Michael (hope my spelling is right!) for giving the nightmare version of We Must Away... tonight, we gave it a valiant effort but came up short.  Brutal nightmare version of a brutal quest to begin with but looking forward to more attempts next time!

Sorry that we couldn't be there, everyone. We have family in town, so today had too much planned. I am definitely going to do my best to attend the next one.

Arise, oh Thread! 

 

I'm looking for a regular LotR group in north Austin. Is this group still active?

Yes, we meet on Thursdays at Dragon's Lair. We won't be meeting for the next two weeks because of the holidays, but things will start back up in the new year. Come on out, we're glad to have new players join the group!

We just need to get that teleportation thing figured out and we'd be good!
