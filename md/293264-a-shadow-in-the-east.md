Setup attachment -- that helps with King of Dale....

Who would've thought the lowest threat hero would be Gollum?  I suppose he is most excellent at sneaking.

Derufin finally gets a card, but alas -- no Outlands status.

I'm curious what is on Faramir's text.  Since he's the same cost and stats as his leadership ally version, and lore is more hard up for resources than leadership, it needs to be something special.

Can someone give me an example of when Derufin's ability might be useful?  Even if we assume that it lasts forever?  (Since it doesn't say until the end of...)

 

Also, the next cycle is called "Vengeance of the Mordor"?  Misprint?  Seems awkward.

What do you mean lasts forever? It's a single time threat reduction.

Derufin's ability might be useful if you're desparate for threat reduction.  Otherwise not so useful.  Now, if it were on a Rohirrim's card instead of a "Gondor" outlander, it could be more useful.

With LeBoromir's help he provides 3 ranged attack for 3 resources, and Gondor's short on ranged attackers.

I sure hope it's not the final cycle, but if it is then what a way to finish. Taking the fight to the heart of the enemy itself. So, so, cool! 

And wow Smeagol, Grima, Loreagon may become a new favorite fellowship. Could call it Ranger Rehab.

1/2/1/2 Ranged is a very weak statline for a 3 costed unique character that is supposed to sacrifice itself. Very weird, considering the powercreep going on.

Completely agree.  Sounds more like a Rohan ability too.

Maybe some kind of Achievements?Like a boon you could earn if you collect enough Victory points for instance. 

I really hope we will have another Saling scenario in this cycle.

I would love to navigate in the sea Rhun.

Derufin could be mixed into a Tactics Imrahil deck. Easy to pop into play during combat and get a threat reduction.

Mutual Accord sadly affects only cards in play.  Derufin would be a great asset if he were Rohan, he could use his ability, be retrieved by Gamling or Guthwine, and put back in play for two.  But in the discard pile even Mutual Accord won't help him.  I suppose there's Stand and Fight.  Not many Gondor allies in spirit.

While I certainly hope it isn't the last cycle, I have always thought that the last cycle would take place in Mordor.

So, I must confess I am no expert in these matters, but doesn't someone carrying the One Ring in a time period supposedly between Bilbo's Birthday and Elrond's Council contradict canon a little bit?

I am asking because this wasn't released yesterday.

My guess that Contracts gonna be like the Agenda from AGoT2.

 

A card that defines your deck, provides some benefits, alters the deckbuilding rules, applies some restrictions, etc.

 

Like, you cannot include dwarves into your deck, but your elves get +1 wp or whatever.

Play Bilbo.

I'm ok with giving us flexibility with the story.  I might like to imagine a version were. Faramir, Grimbeorn, and Brand son of Bane were at the council of Elrond instead of Boromir, Legolas, and Gimli.

A lot to go over with this. Overall, I'm extremely happy and excited for this announcement. Biggest news for me is we're finally getting a One Ring player card, and it seems to be fitting and powerful. Gollum hero also is another thing I was waiting for, and more importantly it signals Caleb's willingness to cover some of the dark themes that have been missing for years in this game. Here's hoping the Rhun/East cycle finally brings some of my most expected characters, namely hero Saruman and the Blue Wizards. Also, this new Master keyword could be some sort of Doomed reboot I was waiting for for a true Artifact theme/subarchetype. Here's hoping Caleb expands on the "magic", "arts of the Enemy" doom-y artifacts themes during this cycle, as it would fit it perfectly. The expansion itself, the art and story all excite me quite a bit (love the wild ox reference in the River Running art, as it was from hte wild oxen of Rhun that the Horn of Gondor was taken). Can't be more glad for this game, and now I'm more certain than ever that right now it's the best it's ever been.

Is this a player card? Okay, that makes it easier to ignore since it will be optional and won't be referred to in the game.

Well, now I just realized this is the Seventh Ring.

Didn't Frodo have the ring then?  Bilbo left it behind and Frodo used it to escape being seen by the Sackville-Bagginses.  (As I recall.)

I guess the sixth AP of this new cycle will make a great christmas gift next year :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Many surprising things in this announcement. Didn't expect Smeagol hero, but man did they put effort into him. Even though I see myself flip the table once he betrays me in the first staging...


Having the one ring become a playable attachment is a thing you would't have done. As all other "legendary" objects (Sting etc.) it is in the possession of one person (if I get the timeline right it should be Bilbo). But ofc the game would only be have as fun if you couldn't make Boromir the Steward of Gondor or equip Legolas with Anduril, so in general I am fine with giving unique things to "wrong" characters. But this is the ONE ring. And it is so often defined as the pure evil that shouldn't be used, it feels wrong to have it as a player card and not as the thing a poor guy has to endure just long enough to destroy it. I am curious if there will be a penalty for "overloading" the ring carrier? As mentioned you loose if he dies/looses the ring. And the best way to keep someone alive in this game is to buff him up with attachments. Sure you can "protect" Spirit Pippin, who only carries the ring, but can die to one unlucky EC during during questing. Put it on Boromir with blood of numenor and fire of Gondor and you are unlikely to have him killed of and loose you the game, effectively doing what the "canon" tells not to do: Give the ring to the mighty and powerful. And use with the best intentions.
Also, why call it Master? Don't we all know there is only one Master of the ring?

Mechanics wise (without looking at lore aspects) this expansion seems to be on fire with the Smeagol hero, ring attachment and contracts. Looks like to biggest gameplay addition since side-quests.

 

Anyone else excited to see an Indiana Jones reference in the temple of Doom quest? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I'm torn on this one.

Yesterday, I would have told you that the absolute worst thing you could do for this game (short of making Orc playable characters on the hero's side, perhaps) was to introduce a One Ring player card outside of the Saga expansions. I never really thought about Smeagol as an option, but if I had, it would not have been far behind on the list of worst things you could do.

Frankly, as of yesterday, I would have rather had the game end than introduce these player cards to the game.

But, I trust Caleb. I trust his design instincts, and I trust that just like he came around to a different point of view, so can I. I hope so, at least. The spoiled cards so far seem to indicate that he's taking the appropriate amount of care and thought with this. I hope the final product that emerges at the end of the cycle is a game as true to Tolkien's vision of his world as the game was as of yesterday.

I choose to give the ring to Gondor! Boromir can use the enemy's weapon against them!

But I don't get the hate over the Ring as a player card. It is a strange fate that we should suffer so much fear and doubt over so small a thing. Such a little thing. 

## 34 [John Constantine on April 2, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3666240)

What if the One Ring is an example of new contract card type?

I mean, it sounds like an Agenda to me, it's a card that doesn't go into your deck and is in play immediately, it alters the rules - you're gonna go 5 threat earlier, and it alters deckbuilding - offers the access to the cards you'll otherwise won't have access to.

## 35 [Halberto on April 2, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3666242)

I like the design of the one ring card. It does nothing by itself but making you lose faster but from time to time you can take a sip of its power to trigger powerful yet once shot effect.

 

And smeagol hero looks a great card design. Lowest threat hero in the game with a powerful "lore-ish" response ability and a built in mechanic to compensate.

 

## 36 [Halberto on April 2, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3666247)

And I enjoy the smeagol -bilbo comparison. 

Both lore but: 9 threat for 6 stats and passive card draws effect vs 3 threat for 9 stats and response draw card ability with 2 negative effects.

 

 

And smeagol seems working great with Beorn hero who does not exaust to defend gollum and can swing for 5 alone and in turn 1 to flip him to smeagol when needed. 

## 37 [GrandSpleen on April 2, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3666264)

Super excited for this. I'm a big fan of being able to play "what if" decks, so I'm happy that Caleb and any other designers adding their input to the game have come around to the idea of giving us an Arkenstone, a One Ring, a Sting, even though their location is known to us at the time our game is set.  You have the freedom to build thematic decks, but having the freedom to also build wildly off-canon decks is also appealing to me and keeps the game fresh.

Also, I do love Gollum as a character, and have been wanting him as a playable card for a long time.  I love his design.  Amazed by the 3 threat!  

I like the fist Master card that we've seen.  Now you have some cancellation in any sphere you wish.  Plop that into a tactics deck, cancel a location and hope for an enemy to replace it.

It's definitely great news as a new player. One just to have more content coming to make sure I do invest in more packs, and boxes as I see them knowing more is coming and just to be able to grab an expansion from the start of its cycle and follow it through to its conclusion. That's going to be a lot of fun to follow. So I'm looking forward to see what the new pieces included are going to be and how it all plays out, and likely hope that being towards mordor location wise it isn't going to bring the game to an end just as I get my first experience of a cycle!

Me too, looks super powerful. Their are some real nasty enemies you can outright discard like the Mûmak. And because you start with it in your hand and it costs "0" you can cancel some nasty effect that would have triggered during setup.

Merry discovered the ring when he observed Bilbo using to escape the Sackville-Baggins.  This was before the party, of course, when the ring was left for Frodo.

In the period between the party and Frodo leaving the shire no one but Frodo had the ring.  No one but Bilbo had Sting or the Mithril Shirt.  No one had the Arkenstone or Orcrist.  Cirdan hadn't had his ring for ages.  And Eowyn turned six years old at the time of the party.  Every player has the option of indulging in alt-history or constructing decks that would only be thematically correct for 3001-3017.  Personally I wish they hadn't restricted the game to that narrow space, and I feel most cycles could reasonably be set earlier than 3001.

I do think it's fitting that Gollum will be one of the heroes who *can't* have the Ring.  (I think Beorn is the only other.)

I was at first really disappointed by this, because I've really wanted a Rhun cycle, and this was "ruined" for me by the fact that I thought the Ring was an objective card and that this cycle was just an alternative to the events of LOTR. While it's still not really possible in the Canon, I like the fact that it is just a player card and that I can just ignore it. On the other hand, while I don't think that I will use it much, I could see having some fun with it. Maybe I can even go full Decipher style and have it turn up in the Rohan and Gondor missons of the saga boxes! 😂(Since discovering this game, I'm utterly struck by how that game pales in comparison to this one! About the only thing that I like about it was seeing some of the movie stills, especially the ones from the scenes that didn't even make the extended cuts.)

I didn't notice the ring is restricted.  That also rules out Quickbeam, and as a practical matter makes the Ring unattractive for attackers/defenders, at least with the Master card we've seen.

What a fascinating expansion. The Smeagol/Gollum mechanic looks very interesting, and the setting is great. I know a lot of people wanted the Shire but this seems a good pick too.

And the Ring? Wow. The ability is fitting and I'm not against it being in the game, but I have to be honest I feel a certain uneasiness at the weight of responsibility should you put it in your deck. The shadows seem that much closer, that much darker...

Someone mentioned the hope of the travelling Wizards being in this set and the thought made me squeal on the inside, that would be awesome.

It's going to be a long time before I get to this set, but man what a fun direction. Looking forward to it!

What do you think the other hero is in this set? It's likely not one of the blue wizards as it would seem kind of odd to have one in a deluxe and one in an AP. It could be Saruman. Possibly a new version of Frodo or Sam. My honest hope is that we get another character from the Outlands with the Gondor trait. We don't really have many Gondor Warrior heroes, and another one would be nice!

Those would all be good ideas! 

Well we were told that the two heroes from the collectors edition will be in a future cycle, which assuming it's this one, would leave 5 unaccounted for heroes. Two blue wizards in adventure packs and a new Frodo for the final pack. Which leaves hopefully Saruman for the other hero in the deluxe. Would be a cool theme having the original White Wizard as a neutral hero to take us into Mordor. 

Oh wait that's only 4, I guess we need a new Boromir then with the ability: "After Boromir participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, add 1 resource to his resource pool." 

And then best of all the flavor text: "One does not simply walk into Mordor."

IIRC, we weren't told that they'd come in a cycle,  just that they would show up in a regular lotr lcg product. I think that the best odds are on the starter set as a standalone product with regular art, separate from the collectors edition

We could get Thorin Stonehelm in the Deluxe. We haven't seen a tactics hero in a non-saga deluxe since the Angmar cycle.

I'd like to see the starter set as a standalone product, I think it would make an excellent introduction to the game and it complements a single core quite well.  However, the announcement said "These heroes will eventually enter The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game through standard products", and I don't think the hypothetical starters set would either be a standard product or qualify for the plural.  There's no guarantee they'll be in the same cycle, of course.

Well, I don't think Caleb sat down with a marketing intern and said, "Hey, this hero is coming out in an AP next cycle, and the other one is coming out in the following cycle, so be EXTRA careful to use a plural here, OK?"

I know often all we have as evidence is what FFG puts on its site, but I caution reading too much into the words where the marketing department is concerned, as they have repeatedly gotten things across multiple game lines wrong. (I also think a starter set that didn't cost $100 might very well count as "standard", but that's neither here nor there.)

## 52 [dalestephenson on April 3, 2019](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293264-a-shadow-in-the-east/?do=findComment&comment=3666604)

I also don't think Caleb sat down and invented two brand-new heroes for a product that otherwise contained exactly zero new player cards.  It makes much more practical sense to borrow two heroes that have already been playtested for a future cycle or cycles.  Now it's *possible* for two yet-to-be-released heroes to be in the same deluxe, but as Thorin and Gildor have nothing in common and never met (that we know), that doesn't fit the pattern for past deluxes:  two dwarves, two Gondorians, two Rohirrim, two Dunedain, two Noldor, Legolas & Gimli, two Dale.  So even if FFG had said nothing at all, I'd expect both heroes to be released in separate, regular products.  As they said exactly that, I see little reason to hedge on my expectations.

While I recognize that FFG releases aren't authoritative, the way the new heroes are portrayed in the article (brand new, but coming eventually in standard products) is different than the way the new quests are portrayed in the article (brand new and unique).  I think the starter set *should* be released by FFG as a regular product, but there's been no hint from FFG that they will do so.

Since past deluxes *do* have links between their hero, who could be released with Gollum in the next deluxe?  I'm betting on a new version of Frodo or Sam.

That would be my guess as well.

I personally love the direction the game is taking.  One thing that makes Lord of the Rings LCG an awesome experience for Lord of the Rings fans is the way in which the expansions are so closely tied to the story of the setting.  Adding smegol as a playable character is a natural progression here and as has always been the case with this LCG, no matter how we speculate, everyone is always ultimately surprised with what FFG comes up with.  The game is taking a step into a new direction and while I can see that not everyone will love the direction, the important thing here is that we took another step forward.  The risk of Lord of the Rings LCG being canceled grows year after year as the game gets older so everytime a new deluxe expansion is announced I sigh in relief knowing that my favorite game lives on.  Do I love every expansion, every concept, every mechanic that they have introduced?  No I don't, but I love the fact that no matter how much I add to my collection there is always more to get.  

This is all great news for fans and I'm ecstatic!  Thank You FFG!!  My credit card is in the mail.

On one hand, I am really happy we got an announcement, on the other, I too would also prefer the Shire. Aslo, the cards seem a bit less exciting than usual. Of course I want to see Sméagol but without encounter control, losing a hero to the Stinker cards, that’s a bit risky. That being said, with 3 starting threat it is an ideal hero for a mono-Lore secrecy Denetor encounter manipulation deck, perhaps.

Can't agree with you more. I've learned through several talks that Asmodee pretty much runs the website marketing. Caleb may not even get the chance to really look at the articles or have any say to edit the article before it's released. Please don't punish Caleb! 

 

 

Remember! You're just playing your "version" of what happens between the books. What if Boromir DID find the ring and take it for Gondor? What if Aragorn or Galdriel did see themselves as capable enough to bear the burden?

I've never bought into the whole "game is dying" idea.  I enjoy it too much to believe enough people will lose interest in it that it will die.  That being said I can see the designers getting to the point where they would like to do something different.  Having said that, if this cycle dose take us to Mordor itself, and not just its borderlands, I still don't think that's how they would end it.  There and back again.  I expect the last box to be about the Shire.

If they really felt like it, they could also do quests that run parallel to the Sagas. See what other people were doing at the same time, that weren't featured in the books.

I'm not going to say the game is dying.  But as a huge fan from the early days, it is certainly showing its age.  The cards and scenarios are becoming more and more complex as time goes on, which is not a good sign. 

The last time I played the Ring Saga campaign scenarios, it took like 50% more time just to track all the effects while playing.  In the end, we spent more attention on the rules than the experience and it felt shallow.  A healthier form of complexity would be in the combinations of simple, iconic cards within a growing card pool.  It's not bad, but it's not great either. 

I do trust the designers and their judgment in general - they've demonstrated it repeatedly - but the mechanics cannot just keep going this way indefinitely.  It will eventually need a reboot or refocus to support continued growth and for this particular game, I'm not sure that's "in the cards" so to speak.

Minor nitpick, but Dol Guldur was destroyed by Lady Galadriel in the third age, after the three assaults on the Golden Wood. Mirkwood was cleansed, renamed, and split between Celebron, Thranduil, and the Woodmen and Beornings (and presumably any other dale-men in the area).

I've played every cycle (not every scenario but at least 4 in each cycle), and i think the cycle with the more boring and complex elements of gameplay is The Ring maker Cycle, which was early in the game history.

Each Quest cards and a lot of Enemy cards have the Time X keyword, which is sooo boring and have so many effects that triggers. And the Ring maker was only the 4th cycle in the game. 

I don't find the cards  are becoming more complex. If you look at  the Heroes on the last cycle, Haldan, Thranduil  for instance have very simple effects. And look at Sméagol, it's a very simple yet unseen effect.  Sure the game is complex, but i love a complex game, where each action should be carrefully chosen.

 

The thing i found weird is the number of the  The Shadow in the East product. It's MEC77. It should have been MEC72,because The fate of Wilderland is MEC71.

Or maybe there is other products awaiting us in the shadows. ^^

I'd say we have stepped away from the complexity we had been seeing. We reached a peak insanity around the end of the Ring-maker cycle, with the Time mechanic being hard to keep track of, especially in a scenario like The Antlered Crown where so many different cards have time counters. At the time, people were saying that it was way too much to keep track of. I think FFG took that feedback seriously and has given us simpler scenarios since then--- I definitely definitely don't see a linear progression in complexity that has continued unbroken.

A good run. But I feel the game is getting a bit overly crunchy and is running out of steam.
Ending with Mordor would be a good thing.

Perhaps squeeze out a last little cycle to close things off.

Agreed. I'm working under the assumption this is now the last cycle. We've had a great run and let's face it, there is years worth of gameplay out there. Hate to be negative, but FFGs attitude to restocking is now so poor, that I think they want to wind it down and focus on new stuff. Just to say, that if it is the last cycle, ending in Mordor is good. Maybe we get to fight the Dark Lord (an unwinnable battle surely) maybe as a distraction as Frodo and Sam cross Mordor?

Now I'm confused. Looking on One Wiki to Rule them All, the fourth age began when the Ring was destroyed which would put the destruction of Dol Guldur in the Fourth Age. However, It also said that the fourth Age Began on March 25, 3021 (exactly 2 years after the Ring was destroyed). Which was it?

Edit: There seems to be a little bit of confusion concerning the date due to different calendars, however, I guess the Third Age ended with the departure of the Three Elven rings, not the Fall of Sauron.

Correct! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

The Battle of the Morannon, destruction of the Ring, and the Downfall of Sauron occurred on March 25, TA 3019. After recovering from the three assaults on Lorien (March 11th, 15th, and 22nd), the Host of the Galadhrim marched on and destroyed Dol Guldur on the 28th.

Different peoples (the Shire, Gondor) have different dates for year One of the Fourth Age, some overlapping with the end of the Third Age (when the Ringbearers passed into the West in 3021. This might clear it up some: http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Fourth_Age [http://tolkiengateway.net/wiki/Fourth_Age]

I hoped if we got the East the two Wizzards would be there, in the deluxe. It is hard to pair anyone with Sméagol. Had they not said it in the article, I would have thought we get just one hero. Also note a strange numbering, whilst previously the heroes always got slots 1 & 2, the One Ring is 1 and Sméagol is 72 (with Stinker being 71 and Gollum 73, if I remember correctly, the last numbers out there, presumably). So, will the other hero get 2? Is he really there? If so, Frodo seems natural, but then again Spirit would, and we got him in Spirit. Maybe Leadership instead?

Also, 29 player cards, what does that mean? It includes the three copies, right? But not the heroes? The One Ring will be there just once, hopefully, then 28 more? Nine cards times three plus another with a single copy? Who can help me here?

To a degree I can agree with that. Plenty of options. Plenty of content.
But in the area everyone seems pretty burned out on it since at least a year. 

I'm actually unsure whether it still sells extremely well or awfully. I feel it could go either way.
It's very hard to tell with LCG's. 

We'll see. There's in any case enough steam to finish another lap given what they planned and then we'll find out what's next. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I also play from day 1, and I am a bit torn on the issue. I am glad we have many more cards to choose from, many more archetypes. But at the same time I agree some of the cycles are nowehere as exciting as they used to be. And with the strong decks, the old are not as exciting either. But I really think they nailed it with the Saga quests. An according to the polls, it seems many people agree.

Frodo would be a fit in leadership or lore.  But not tactics.  I think pairing Gollum with Sam would also be appropriate.

29 player cards is an odd number since it isn't divisible by three.  But if there's only one ring, that would leave 28 players cards, also not divisible by three.  This shouldn't include the heroes, since they're called out separately -- the wilds announcement said two heroes and 39 player cards, and we got 13 distinct player cards (three copies of each), one neutral and three in each sphere.  But it's also an extremely *low* count for a Deluxe, since APs routinely come with 27 player cards plus a hero.  At 156 cards it exactly matches Wilds of Rhovanion, so the total card count matches.

The ring lets you pull a Master card in hand -- are the Master cards 3x, and how many different Master cards are there?  The one we see is clearly modelled on Black Rider Frodo, so I'll guess there's four Master cards.  If they were 3x, that plus a single ring would account for 13 player cards, leaving only 16 player cards for non-ring related cards -- making this deluxe *much* less useful than an AP for those who aren't interested in playing the ring (and still not a multiple of three).

Yeah I'm guessing 2× 2 Master cards and then 8×3 player cards this is certainly a low numbering for a deluxe expansion, but if the scenarios are that good I don't care! Plus Faramir is likely going to be very good if they want to make him rival his leadership ally card.

I think that that just looking at how fast reprints go and how out of stock things are that FFG would be crazy to end it.

That being said, for theory-crafting sake I do recognize some of the language and the locations sounds a bit final so I'll offer some alternative thoughts to just business as usual new cycles:

-They could be launching a new campaign set paralleling the books timeline

-They could be launching a new campaign set in the fourth age.

-they could be relaunching nightmare/saga -style campaign packs to upgrade each cycle similar to AH's packs that revisit old missions.

-They are actually insane and don't like money and want to put effort into Journey's in Middle earth or the digital version (which why is this not on IOS???)

Anyways I would be cool with any of th first three options, but not as much with the last. Only time will tell

For the non-hero player card loadout, to hit 29 I'm placing my bet on: 1 One Ring, 1 Contract, 9x3 other player cards. Which would indeed be low for a deluxe, but hey, the Ring lies heavy, no?

As pointed out, there usually has been 13 cards in a deluxe pack, with 3 copies of each.

So might it make more sense to say 5 unique cards + 8x3 (two from each sphere) = 13 different cards? Yours does include the neutral card, though, but I wonder if that will have 3 copies of it too.

If the Master Ring comes as a 1x, I see two main possibilities:

 1. There is a deck building restriction not printed on the card that limits it to one per deck—e.g., a blanket limit on Master cards. I dunno, a single use of super-Eleanor for –5 threat elimination level, and increased susceptibility to straight-up losing doesn't seem worth it to me. (Thematic? lol)
 2. There is no such restriction, and we'd have to buy multiple copies of the box to get the 3x you can put into a single deck. As far as I recall, outside of the Cores and the Collector's Edition, no product has called for that. Is that correct?

Since I don't think either of those is palatable, I believe Master Ring will be 3x.

I think it's possible that individual master cards are unique, but there's a set of them (four for the different Frodo versions) . You'd choose one to be in hand, and the others (if you want them) would be in your deck.

Ah, that's an interesting possibility. But the other Fellowship Frodo abilities always felt underwhelming to me. Hmm.

If it's both a setup mechanic and unique, why would you need more than one copy?

Edit: it also says that if it leaves play, the players lose, so you can't even get a chance to lose it and then put another copy back in play.

Thanks for the analysis. I hate at this point that we are getting so few player cards and then one of them is actually Derufin who seems very underwhelming (though I still hope to be proven wrong on that one, and I really like the art).

Are you perhaps conflating the One Ring, the Setup attachment; and The Master Ring, the event?

I would hope we get a leadership hobbit, and of course Frodo makes the most sense.

Spirit: Pippin, Merry, Fatty, Frodo

Tactics: Tom, Merry, Bilbo

Lore: Pippin, Bilbo, Folco

Leadership: Sam

Yes, there is a several good Hobbit-theme or Hobbit-compatible cards in Leadership, so I would love to see a 2nd option in Leadership as well. Wanting Leadership Frodo as the 2nd hero in the box, and with the One Ring being included and that Master event which is Frodo-Gollum theme, I'm really hopeful.

To me also except the one from the Black Riders; that effects saved our game so many times. The Master Ring does a similar thing without the need of reshufling, which is great, but the fact it is only an event makes it a lot less powerful.

Also, if the One Ring is #1 and the Master Ring #9, it means there are most likely not even 2 player cards per sphere in the deluxe.

Is anyone else a bit bummed that it looks like once again Gondor will get the most support (as it appears). They already have far and away the most allies. I hope for the rest of the cycle the other tribes (especially my Noldor and Silvans) get some more love…

AFAIK they haven't hinted at any more saga boxes, though I've hoped for them.  But they also haven't hinted this cycle is the last cycle.

I'm not convinced this cycle will actually enter Mordor; it seems a waste to try to cram in Rhun *and* Mordor in the same cycle.  And I don't think the "Vengence of Mordor", to the extent it makes sense at all (we don't know of anything Easterlings did to offend Sauron) would take place *in* Mordor.  The flavor text says the deluxe takes place in "the lands of Rhûn that rest in the shadow of Sauron’s domain."   That's a bit fanciful for the River Running, Dorwinion, and the Hills of Rhun (just southwest of the lake).  While that does leave us reasonably close to Mordor, you'd have to go further east to get around the Ash Mountains, at which point you could just as easily go east instead of south-then-west.  Why not explore Rhun?  It's a vast space with varied races of men, kingdoms of elves, the home of a number of dwarven kindreds, and the stomping groups of at least one and possibly both blue wizards.  So much potential.

Perhaps they will revisit old cycles and turn them into campaigns with boxes and new cards, a la Arkham Horror TCG's "Return to" product line?

I honestly can't say. I think I heard it hear or on the Facebook page. To my memory, it was attributed to Caleb, but I may honestly been totally mistaken. Nobody else seems to know about this, so it's more than possible that it was never said and that I'm simply remembering incorrectly.

This is funny because I like Noldor and Silvan most but I do not mind seeing more Gondor because I feel, despite the number of cards, their archetypes are still far behind the Elves. It hurts then all the more seeing such an underwhelming Gondorian ally as Derufin.

Over the last couple of years, I've found myself playing lotr less than before, and looking forward to Arkham releases more. Part of that is definite frustration at the pace of releases and unexplained delays.

It does seem likely this is the last cycle, but if so I'm ok with that, there is already more content for this game than almost anything else I've played. There are loads of heroes and archetypes  I've not even played yet, and quests i haven't touched for years. I've got many years if enjoyment of the game still to come.

I was thinking the threat reduction was a passive effect, but it is part of the response.

 

The contract seems to give passive effects for a certain time. The one we see provides +1 attack, wp and probably defense to some characters, but you can't play allies while it still active (I suppose, it is partially readable).

I think it will be a kind of long term event, which can remains for more than 1 turn and give a very interesting boost, but have some negatives effects on the other side

Thanks for posting! I'm very excited for another leadership hobbit. And he also works well with Bilbo+sting combo (bilbo quests, bilbo readies with frodo payment, deals damage, reduces threat, engage an enemy, defend with sting + 1 more damage). Throw sam in there too and you have a combat ready hobbit line up

Certainly my own desires affect analysis.  I want to explore all the places that have not been explored.  I want to revisit areas not adequately covered.  I want more heroes.  I want more archtypes.  I want two of the archtypes introduced in the current cycle (woodmen and Beornings) to get more support.  I want saga expansions that explore times *outside* the narrow window the current game has been constrained in.  One last cycle clearly isn't going to accomplish all those things.  There's only three things that could force an end to the game IMO:

1) Losing the license

2) Sales not justifying further development

3) Designers not wishing to develop any further (out of ideas or bored).

I don't think #1 is likely in the near future.  #2 is always possible, but given that everything they print sells out quickly seems implausible on its face.  #3 is always possible, but certainly the current cycle gives no hint of an end to their ideas.

It's true that "it has all led to this" could be a hint and not just marketing fluff.  While it could've been said of any release, it hasn't been said, and maybe it's a hint that This Is The End.  But I think it's ironic that in the same thread where the *clear* statement than the two starter set heroes would be released in regular products is questioned as being the product of an ignorant marketing intern with no insight into the future of the game, that a vague bit of marketing fluff would constitute solid evidence.  Who writes these releases?

"Stocks being run down everywhere" doesn't tell me much about the future of the game, because reprints selling out quickly has been the rule for years (and is a sign of *healthy* demand, I think).

Having lots of game has been true for a long time, so also doesn't tell me much about the future of the game.

It's also true that the cover shows Mordor (from the outside) and not Rhun.  It's possible that the cycle will pivot into Mordor, and since Mordor is the biggest, baddest destination in Middle Earth that would be a logical stopping point if you're looking for a stopping point.  But if true, it means that the game never would explore Rhun at all.  We already know where the quests of the deluxe take place, and they're all *west* of Lake Rhun, in territory once held by Gondor in its prime and arguably part of Rhovanion, not Rhun.  As I said, this would be a terrible shame.  The designers were able to tease nine quests out of little bits of Numenor sticking out of the water, but can only spare three quests on the borders of the vastness of Rhun?

The view of Mordor is from the Black Gate.  This is considerably closer to Minas Tirith than to the hills of Rhun, and as Frodo discovered is quite possibly the worst possible way to get into Mordor.  Even if this cycle did end in Mordor, I do not think we would be going that way.  The deluxe ends in a temple to Sauron outside Mordor, but if you want to put a Sauron reference on the cover, what else would you picture besides Barad-Dur/Mount Doom/Black Gate?

Sauron has a history in Rhun and stayed there during the watchful peace of 2063-2460.  It's possible that Sauron revisited his power base there between 2941 (chased out of Dol Goldur) and 2951 (declares himself openly in Mordor).  I think it would be cool if the destination of this cycle is not Mordor, but whatever fortress was used by Sauron in his stay in Rhun and likely is still under his control in the succeeding years.  Sauron's center of power in Rhun, held by him for nearly a thousand years (at least), could be a very interesting and dangerous place.

The "It has all led to this", could be in reference to the continuing of this specific narrative that started in the Grey Havens. Correct me if I'm wrong, but each deluxe and cycle since then has led into the next one. At the end of Havens, we were stranded in Harad. At the end of Harad, we went to look for a place for the Haradrim to live in Wilds. So maybe this is the last "linked" story line and the next deluxe will see us starting a new adventure.

I'd be extremely surprised if "It has all led to this" carries any indication of the future. It's just dramatic fluff.

I would think that "It's all led to this" could bear some significance if it were for the final AP, but it's an odd way to announce a cycle. I'm voting with the dramatic fluff crowd. I think we'll be told when a cycle will be the last. Also, though, we could still see more releases for the game, even if the cycle format is over.

This was on the Facebook community page, apparently the French spoiler article gave us different cards:

And somebody translated Frodo hero as: ""Response: when Frodo Baggin commits to a quest spend 1 ressource from his ressource pool to ready another unique character committed to the quest. If you obtain a quest success during that phase, reduce your threat level by 1."

I like that it's character instead of hero.  That will let Rosie double dip on questing if necessary.

LeFrodo would be an excellent third hero for the Gandalf/Elrond Vilya deck.

Just to add another perspective on the "final cycle" nonsense arguments: A few people have said that Mordor (if we're going there, which we may well not be) would be a good place to set the final cycle (which this almost certainly isn't). But personally I think it's much more likely that, not knowing for sure how long the game will run, if Caleb has cool ideas for a cycle that goes to Mordor (or Rhun, or anywhere else), he's just going to do them. He's not going to postpone those ideas specifically to make sure they end up being the last things he makes, he's just going to get them out there so everyone can enjoy them sooner rather than later.

Caleb giving us cool stuff is not evidence the game is dying, it's evidence Caleb has cool stuff for us to enjoy.

Let's wait for spirit Aragon before the final verdict. I strongly believe his spirit version would have gondor trait and/or synergy. It would make sense for spirit aragorn to be his Elessar/king of men, side.

And Gondor is not so bad as it is, but since I like to play them almost as much as I do Noldor or Silvan, I see it is inferior against most of the quests (which I play at least), probably all compared to the Noldor discard Lords of the Eldar Narya Erestor monster.

OK, powerfully argued and perfectly reasonable arguments. Just to say that the stocking situation at least here in the UK is appalling (much worse than the games' great days of 2+ years ago) and I do think overall it is at last being wound down. 

I also thought that the picture of the Morannon was an odd one (if I was in Rhun, I would enter Mordor from the East), but I don't believe that they would have used it if the adventure was solely staying in Rhun (they didn't use a generic Mordor pic with Sands of Harad for example).

Fun to hear your thoughts as ever, and we shall see 🙂

Yeah, I second the request. It is a forced effect, and one can only guess if there is a way to get rid of the contract (willingly or otherwise). If not, the timing on these might be very the most important thing, unless of course you run a very specific deck, in this case, no allies.

Side B


You cannot play or put into play allies.

Each Character you control gets +1 +1 and +1.

 

Forced : When a character you control leaves play (discard, or return not readable) this card. 

 

 

That means there is a side A. 😊

Thanks for the contract translation. Seems great, except we do not get the rules yet. I had thought it would be just easy put into play thing but with side a & b, it can be more complicated than that. If it is not too costly though, the bonus on this side b is certainly great for not being able to play allies for a while, espcially as you can easily time it yourself.

I don't think it has a cost in a traditional sense you mean. It has no resource cost, and if it's double sided - it doesn't go into the deck. You include it into your deck and it starts the game in play immediately, like a boon permanent from saga.

No, I did not think so either, I meant more: you have to do something in order to put it into play in the first play (like a requirement), which will be stated on Side A. I hope to see the full card, and have the mechanics explained, soon, because out of all the previewed cards in the box so far, I am most excited about the Contract, and I hope we get one in each pack of the cycle.

Contrast sounds like beneficial effect similar to player side quest with limitations to make up for the gap of not having to put progress to benefit for their effect. Let's see if contracts are set up cards or set aside cards requiring event card effect to be put in play similarly to player card with Encounter keyword.

I hope you will not need another card to play it. I am guessing each player will be able to have one Contract per game and play it once some requirement is met, thus turning from Side A to Side B which is the active part.

Yes. Range make him a lot better in spirit for lack of competition. Still 3 blu resources for a unique ally with an ability which seems over coasted and fairly easy to come by in spirit with many better alternatives...

But as i said , let's wait for spirit aragorn (I'm sure he will have a gondor synergy...) before giving a final word on derufin.

Because derufin is fills an attacker role not the usual questing role the typical spirit ally cover. And stat/cost ratio he is the best attacking ally in spirit. 3 resources for 2 attack AND range in spirit was unheard until now. All the others 2+ attack ally in spirit cost 3 to 5 resources when paid in their full cost and none has range. Range do increase his value as you would always have target for his action  in 2+ player while with the other attacking spirit allies you sometimes waste their action.

What puzzle me and lower a bit his value in my book his his ability which seems expensive for the effect and so easy to come by in sphere with so many alternatives most of which are better. I can see myself easily put him as a 1x copy in several spirit heavy multiplayer deck to get some attack power but I hardly immagine to use his ability in most games. It seems more a panic button just in case  than an ability you want to use in most game.

For the most I would consider him as an ally with good stat/cost for the sphere  with no ability when deckbuilding.

I rate him as a solid and good option in sphere but -for the moment- one step short of being a great ally. If he just had 1 more point of base attack I would gladly pay 4 resources and be happy.

My comment on the future is that today gondor decks are essentially leadership deck with space for tactic/lore inclusion. If spirit aragorn would have gondor synergy and some few spirit gondor ally arrives we would have the possibility to build leadership/spirit gondor deck where derufin buffed by leadership boromir ability ( plus the usual benefit of leadership resources generation) will become a GREAT  ally choice. But I agree with you: that is the (hypothetical) future.

While Derufin doesn't fit into a Gondor deck, Visionary Leadership and LeBoromir are both global buffs, so he fits well into a spirit-using deck in fellowship with a Gondor deck.

Derufin as Gondor makes it highly unlikely that other neglected outlanders will bolster that type.  Outlands could've used a ranged attacker with a useful discard ability.

I agree Derufin's Response is gravy that will rarely be used, but even if Spirit has a smattering of effects that help other people's threat, almost all of which are pretty good to great in themselves, none of those effects also contribute 2 ranged attack until then.

(It would be quite strong indeed out of Spirit if he costed 2, or had 3 attack. Probably too strong, IMHO.)

I definitely would like to see him become great. That is nothing I want to see less in the game than a card I never play, and especially one with such a nice art like Derufin. As for the ability, at least it seems better than ally Damrod’s, at least he is a guy I never ever play.

Right damrod. Honestly I had forgotten he even existed for the number of time I played him.

Which make me wonder if the spirit gondor ally them would be to be discarded to reduce threat based on different conditions ( number of enemies in staging area , detroyed enemy threat,  progress made , explored location quest point...).

I do hope no; it's seem to me the wrong theme for gondor allies.

 But lets wait and see what the future holds for us.

Denetohr deserves a playable ally. The ine we got is honestly very bad. Not all card can be equally good but an iconic character like him deserves a better treatment ... as for the sphere either would make sense from deckbuilding perspective.

Leadership boromir would be nice even if conflicting with his hero card which is an anchor of most gondor deck. And a Bergil ally. Please.

On the contrary I think we will get few more spirit gondor ally, especially in case spirit aragorn would really have any gondor synergy (of which I'm personally convinced but that is not at all granted). In any case  you are right about other spirit gondor ally not having treath/discard ability although they do have ability related to a discard mechanism of a sort. Let's see and hope.

Yes, when ally Denethor came out I was just furious. I mean you have got Faramir and Denethor with the same cost and all stats the same, just the latter has one willpower more and totally negative ability, whilst the former has one of the strongest abilities in the game. And the latter comes out two years later when the encounter cards are generally tougher and the player cards generally stronger. What happened there? If the card was like that but also fetched a title attachment, then it would be more thematic and I would be happy though.

I have been watching the news page closely... any update on this or the cycle at large? I was certainly very excited December of 2017 as that was my first announcement of a new cycle since I started playing... and the subsequent wait and analysis of the cards before I even played with them was part of the fun too. Now with this cycle announcement, I relive the feelings again. I hope this game has some more legs to it, it's a fun annual tradition at this point!

The biggest question I have is how the contracts work, and if they are counted as part of the player cards we receive. I can't imagine there is more than one copy of a contract, but I do expect to see them throughout this cycle. The inclusion seems to throw the numbers off. Others questions include:

What are the other cards in the box?

What is lore faramir's text?

How many "The one ring"s do we get?

With Wilds of Rhovanion, we received the announcement on December 8th, and the follow up walk through on January 31st. The announcement for this expansion was April 2nd which means we are pretty close to a follow up announcement if it follows the same pacing (no reason to believe there would be).

Or who knows, maybe @LordBird [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/333840-lordbird/] already received it. 😅

By the way, for those keeping track, the announcement of ered mithrin cycle was April 9th, 5 months and a day after the announcement of the expansion, and a little over two months from the release of the expansion. That would put the timeline around:

1. Follow up walkthrough of expansion any time now.

2. Announcement of first pack around September

3. Expansion released in November (even though it said 3Q in announcement)

Unfortunately, The One Ring 2nd Edition will likely not be released until December/January timeframe.

I'm sure it'll be explained in the rule book upon release. My guess is that if you pick Smeagol to be your starting hero, then no other versions of Smeagol AND Gollum can used.

I am a little bit surprised there is no follow up announcement, maybe breaking down contracts or something, that also comes with the release date. Technically quarter 3 starts in two weeks. But I am not holding my breath that it comes out in July, and I'd be shocked if the release date was September or earlier. 

I'd love to be wrong, though.

So we now know Player cards 2-6 (1+ 4X3) and 9-11 (3x3) plus 72 (1) of the 29 player cards this leaves only 6 which are clearly cards 7 and 8. So shall they be attachments, events, or even potentially more allies? It's safe to say that they won't be side quests as those would come after the neutral events, but that is clearly not the case. I still prefer Leadership Faramir, but the Lore one seems really good in a ranger trap deck! Maybe we'll get a trap that plays into your engagement zone?

Also feels like something that could help give thematic players a boost.

We have several. Forest Snare, Followed, and Outmatched. The latter two are tactics sphere.

But my gosh, that's a significant boost, and one has to wonder why it's necessary. Suppose those characters have an average of 2 will power as an example. Suddenly you jump from 18 will power to 27. And that's just solo... are quests going to scale so much so that you must bring that much?

Smeagol

Frodo

The One Ring

The Master Ring

The Ruling Ring

The Ring of Power

Pippin

Merry

Faramir

Derufin

The Fellowship

 

My guess is it has to be attachments...

Well, Fellowship also has some drawback: you are not allowed to bring more allies into play and it punishes chump blocking. And with Shadow in the East and a Core Set alone it will be very unattractive to play the contract as you will need 6 permanent allies: Hénamarth and Gléowine from the Core Set work, Beorn is really expensive, especially when you only have one tactics hero, Faramir could work, though he blocks the Lore version and Brok is, well, Brok. Both Lore allies and LeFaramir exhaust for an action and do not use their stats. On the other hand, Denethor could now defend for four without attachments.

Forest Snare plays onto an enemy engaged with you. Not into your engagement zone. Off the top of my head, I can't recall if the other two are the same. But still Ithilien Rangers work best as Lore and Leadership. I suppose Mablung is tactics, but he doesn't really fit with the trap archetype. He's better in a Dunedain deck.

It's definitely a new flavor on the game. Both the contract dynamic and the master player cards add some new capabilities and deck building techniques. However someone who is interested in just adding to player card depth or someone looking to jump into this game with the core set and this expansion is sure to be disappointed.

I like Merry for his ability (definitely a candidate for sneak attack during questing). I think Frodo fits well with his other fellow hobbit heroes and I would like to take some time play testing some decks with him. I'm a bit underwhelmed by Pippin -- seems like a weaker form of the the Sam hero, but I would rather play with the hero version. 

I wasnt planning on exploring the one ring dynamic so I'm a little disappointed many of the cards in the expansion surround the master element. That being said I'd rather that be the case than it appearing numerous times through the adventure packs.

I'm so stoked for the Master cards and the one ring, probably so much that I may skip the three cycles I need to catch up and go right for this pack. Because now I can finally recreate my dream of giving the Ring to Boromir so he can wield it against our enemies. Hahaha

 

Also I imagine you probably wouldn't be able to bring the One Ring in the saga campaigns with Frodo, but could you use that ring from the Sagas to play the master cards?

I want to make a deck that brings Merry out as the 9th member of your fellowship with that contract card, then bounces him out of play and back in for the rest of the game.

What if you bring two unique allies with A Very Good tale when you have 8 already in play? You go from 8 to 10 the card won't flip?

That's how I'd play it. Of course in most cases you'd rather take only the one ally and get the Fellowship bonus.

But maybe you need to chump block first, and then conveniently you are left with nine unique characters.

On another note, something like Sudden Pitfall would be devastating to a Fellowship deck. Definitely has its weaknesses.

For me it's the other way round. Why should I sneak in Merry, when Faramir does so usually better (more targets, less duration, but in most cases only the questing phase requires willpower). And if I plan on playing Hobbits without Lore but Tactis instead, ally Pippin is a great addition. 2 Willpower, readying and 2 Attack (4 with Tom in the first round) for only 2 ressources? Yes, please.

I agree that this expansion is probably not suited for newer players.

Truth but you can still bring extra copies of each ally, so if one dies you can hopefully replace them. Or just have extra unique allies of different types anyways and the first 9 make the fellowship.

So I believe I saw someone say we are down to two more unspoiled cards. When the expansion gets into somebody's hands would they be willing to post what they are? Thanks!
