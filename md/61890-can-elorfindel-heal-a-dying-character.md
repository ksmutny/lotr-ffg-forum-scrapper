Can Elorfindel heal a dying character? Can he heal the last hit point of one character to help him not to die?

 IMO no, since Glorfindel's ability is an Action and therefore, is has to has to be played in an Action window and cannot interrupt or cancel an ongoing situation...only Responses could do that (and in fact, they do not interrupt as much as immediately react to a situation). I'll let my fellow forumites sound off on the subject before sounding too definitive though :-)

No. Removal of character is immediate upon receiving wounds equal to or greater than hit points. So there is no action window available in which to heal before the character leaves play.

 Only instances when a character doesn't die immediately involves Frodo's ability (which is a response) or Song of Mocking (and even then, only if you had specifically designated the dying character beforehand by exhausting the Song and using its Action ability).

And Landroval to some extent, although the hero is officially destroyed, but he/she can be put back into play immediately, with 1 damage.

While this is technically true there IS an action window after the shadow cards are revealed.. so there is a window for healing to occur after the dmg is revealed but before the dmg is placed.

Any lethal dmg though as people have said can not be stopped.

Examples...

Mob attacks -> 4
Elrohir was 1 wounds defends at 1 and 4 health...

4-1 = 3 dmg, 1+3 =4 .. dead hero...

but Glorfindel after the reveal of the shadow card can heal 1 point of dmg... so it is

4-1 = 3 dmg, 3+0 =3 .. fight another round!

BUT as people said you can not use action while placing the dmg points.. so

Mob attacks -> 5
Elrohir was 0 wounds, defends at 1 and 4 health...

5-1 = 4 dmg, 4-4=0 = dead hero...

there is no way to reduce one of these dmg points
