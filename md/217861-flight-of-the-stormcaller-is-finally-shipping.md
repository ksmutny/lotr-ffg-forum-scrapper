Here's hoping it doesn't take too long to ship. So hungry for spoilers!

Shipping is the final step right? Comes right after "On the boat"?

Technically, the final step is "In stores now", but yes, it is the final step before people in the US actually get it.

So it was on the boat for three months.  Uh-huh.

I want the cards, but I also want the Covenant Swan token they are offering with this cycle!  Here [http://teamcovenant.com/lord-of-the-rings-lcg/the-swan-token-for-lord-of-the-rings-subscribers] is what I'm talking about if you haven't seen it yet.  While there won't be that many of them in the end, they are good for using as Timed tokens or even just showing which quest you have chosen for that round.

So, Flight of the Stormcaller reached the Shipping status faster than True Steel. That's something. I was betting on the opposite outcome.

Yeah I really want some swan tokens too but you can only get them if you are subscribed to Team Covenant and get all your AP's and what not through them which is pretty lame if you ask me....

I can buy my own LOTR LCG products thank you very much I don't need a third party to obtain them and get them to me at a way later date...... I would however pay good money for the swan tokens and to make shipping worth it would probably get some other tokens too (I need some more of the eye of sauron ones which I use to show that characters are exhausted which saves having to constantly turn cards around and whatnot, super handy) so it sort of sucks that they are so exclusive...

So what player cards do we know are coming in this pack? What's still unspoiled?

So if I'm not mistaken:

 

Spirit: Tides of Fate, Glorfindel ally

Leadership: None

Lore: Heed the Dream

Tactics: Azain Silverbeard, Last Stand

 

We also know the hero will be Leadership (here's hoping Gondor as well, maybe Hirgon), and that we'll get Leadership resource acceleration effects.

Thanks!

Hirgon is a good guess, and my bet too. I wouldn't mind a new Leadership Denethor either. There are a lot of named Men of Gondor left to choose from though--Hurin the Tall, Anborn, Ingold, etc--so it's really anyone's guess.

I wonder how many cards we're going to get to "support decks designed to run with fewer than three heroes," and what they'll be.

I think that one of them is the Strider attachment.

Though I believe that is from Drowned Ruins. I think that I saw a statement from Matt that there was a second one as well...but not sure.

And then the resource acceleration is his keys.

We normally get 9 player cards right..?

So we should get one more lore card, two leadership and the hero? Or is it nine not including the hero? I forget... 

If the leadership hero isn't Noldor I really hope we get a leadership Noldor ally as we really don't have many of them at all. 

Just Galadriel, Erestor, Rivendell Scout (does anyone use this card???) and Warden of the Havens. Then again we only have 3 tactics allies that are Noldor..... so it would be nice to get another one of them in the near future as well.

 

Also what are people most looking forward to from this pack?

I imagine for MANY people it will be ally Glorfindel. I am already looking at ways to replace Asfaloth effectively so that using the Glorfindel ally is actually a possibility.

I personally, from the cards spoiled so far, am most excited to get Azain Silverbeard. Such a cost effective tactics ally, 3 resources for 3 attack and 2 defence and 2 hitpoints . In a pinch or desperate situation he can defend, he doesn't die to 1 damage to all characters effects and most important he does what he does extremely well. He attacks for 3 consistently and then for one tactics resource can do 2 direct damage! If you are running two tactics heroes and aren't running that many high cost tactics cards and mainly low cost allies and weapons/armour you might even be able to pay for and trigger this ability multiple turns in a row dishing lots of direct damage out!

I have been using Glorfindel ally proxy for an age. He is obviously amazing. There are different decks where he can be placed well: Vilya, Narya, heavy draw, heavy discard -- to get the best out of him.

 

The distribution should be 2 from each sphere, a neutral, a hero. That is the standard, though not the rule. I hope the Leadership hero is either Noldor or Gondor -- and that there is a Leadership ally from either of the traits, too. Heed the Dream is intriguing, and I hope Last Stance makes a difference in a direct damage deck.

I cannot for the life of me imagine what Heed the Dream does but I'm really excited to see the card just because its based off the prophetic dream that Boromir and Faramir had that led Boromir to travel to Imladris and sit in on the Council of Elrond.

The art is amazing and is such an awesome take on Rivendell.

What could it possibly do though.......?

Well, similar here. Amazing art, and I just love that aspect of the story, that story line. Could have Leadership resources built in? Otherwise, I hesitate to guess...

Like a number of people here I'm really hoping for a Gondor hero and either a Gondor ally or attachment.

I finally bet Carn Dum a couple of weeks back, now I can't wait to get started on the upcoming cycle.

I wish we will have a Beorning hero in this first AP. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

*Grimbeorn the Old

 

13 / 1 / 4 / 2 / 6

 

Beorning, Warrior

 

Sentinel. Cannot have restricted attachment.

Grimbeorn the Old does not exhaust to defend against Troll enemies.

When you are engaged with a Troll enemy, Grimbeorn gets  +2 att and +2 def.

 

It would be cool to have a Beorning / Woodland deck one day. We already have 2 woodland allies, why not another Beorning hero?

Oh, I would love to see a Grimbeorn hero card. But then I would like it to somehow combo with either version of Beorn.

 

And yes, why not make Beornings a thing (together with Woodmen indeed).

While we're waiting for our spoilers, here's my ideal Leadership hero that we'll hopefully get (or something similar):

Hirgon

9 threat; 3 willpower; 1 attack; 2 defense; 3 hit points. Gondor. Scout.

Response: After an ally you control is destroyed, draw 1 card. (Limit once per round.)

This would single-handedly solve the main problems Gondor and mono Leadership decks have, at least in solo: lack of early willpower and lack of card draw. Hope we get something like this!

I like this hero! Combined with Sam in a mono leadership deck, he would be a winner.

No, I do not believe we get anything close to that. Their idea of Gondor is very different, I feel. And if Faramir hero is 2 willpower, then surely Hirgon will not be 3. They are quite particular in that area (of hero and ally printed willpower), only a select few get high numbers, and they are high profile characters, exclusively. Also, card drawing in Leadership is quite rare, I think a hero who does that is not going to happen -- but I am less doubtful about this second point.

On a different note, even though the wait for the Stormcaller has been very long, it is still one of the earliest we have seen the first adventure pack during a year, is it not? As far as I recall, only the second cycle (Dwarrowdelf) started earlier than end of April.
