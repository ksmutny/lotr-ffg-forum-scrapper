Hi!

Question...could we insert this ally in any encounter deck for all expansions/ adventure packs? Or it is limited only to the Roam Across Rhovanion adventure pack? I saw that in this adventure pack there are no neutral player cards which makes me think this is actually a neutral ally card that can be added to any encounter deck..is that right?

Thank you!

As long as you include the associated event in your deck, it can be played against any quest.

In this, it functions as any other player card with the encounter keyword.

One more question...

What happens if that eagle card is killed or needs to be discarded? In which discard pile should be added? Player's or encounter's ?

As per the Lost Realm rules, it's actually removed from the game entirely.



> If a player card with the encounter keyword leaves play, it is removed from the game. Do not place it in a player’s discard pile or in the encounter deck discard pile.
