Having always played solo I've decided to give playing two-handed and I was wondering if there were cards (other than Renewed Friendship) which worked off doing something to the other player's heroes.

good choice- i love two handed

 

there is another card- i cant remember what it is now but its in the 2nd hobbit set. maybe someone will know its name

 

it basically gives control of a players cards (or just heroes?) to another player

I think rich is referring to Desperate Alliance, which just happens to be the subject of a recent thread on this forum, here:

http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/90656-aragorn-lore-and-desperate-alliance-mp-trick/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/90656-aragorn-lore-and-desperate-alliance-mp-trick/]

 

Desperate Alliance gives control of one hero (and their resources) to another player for 1 phase.

 

I can't think of any other cards that specifically reward you for doing something to another player's heroes.  But there are several cards with multiplayer-only functions.  Cards like:

 

Wandering Took (spirit ally): You can pass him, along with 3 of your threat, to another player.

Rider of the Mark (spirit ally): Pay a spirit resource to pass him to another player and discard a shadow card.

Brand (tactics hero): Use Brand to defeat an enemy engaged with another player and you can ready one of that player's characters.

Song of Earendil (spirit attachment): After another player raises their threat by 1, you can raise your threat by 1 to lower that player's threat by 1.

 

There are also a few cards that have a stronger effect if you play them with multiple players in the game, like Campfire Tales (leadership event, everyone draws 1 card) and Second Breakfast (leadership event - everyone puts the top attachment from their discard pile into their hand).

Haven´t really got it to work to a satisfactory level (especially since heroes are rarely exhausted in the planning phase) but:

Waiting for the day when we get an event card that lets you play an attachment outside of the planning phase.  Would make this card nicer.
