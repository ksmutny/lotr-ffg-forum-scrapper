Hi all,

 

My apologies if there's another thread already on this subject but I'm looking for a partner for the Gen Con LoTR event. 

My time is Friday at 3pm. I figure if I find a partner, we can start building decks and beat the thing :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

Thanks!

Hi ! I could not get a slot despite registering only a few hours late. But I would not be surpised if there were a few spare seats available at the last minute.
