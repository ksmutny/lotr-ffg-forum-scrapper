# [Current Quest timing question](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/260704-current-quest-timing-question/)

I'm about to try NM Carrock for first time. Setup says...

Forced: At the end of the quest phase, if no progress was placed on the current quest this phase, place 1 progress on the current quest (bypassing the active location).

So my thought is to use side quests to stall the process, but it got me thinking. If I select a side quest to be the current quest and it's completed, does the main quest now become the current quest and I'd still have to put 1 progress on it?

When you select a side quest to be the current quest, it lasts until end of phase, so not sure in the timing... or if I'm overthinking it and even completed, the one I picked is still the current quest and no progress is added.

Anyone know?

The rules says:

At the beginning of each quest phase, if there are one or more side quests in the staging area, the 1rst player may choose one to be the “current quest” until the end of the phase instead of the quest card that is currently active via the quest deck. While a side quest is the current quest, any progress that the players make is placed onto that side quest and any card that target the “current quest” target that side quest. Progress must still be placed on the active location before it can be placed on a side quest. Any progress that is made beyond the current quest’s total quest points is discarded; do not place progress on any other quest card in play. 

 

 

I would play to NOT put 1 progress on the main quest at the end of the phase because the current quest was the just completed side quest.

Does anyone have an official ruling that this works at all? Because the two effects are:

"the first player [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/rulebook.html#rule190] may choose one to be the "current quest" until the end of the phase instead of the quest card [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/rulebook.html#rule44] that is currently active via the quest deck [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/rulebook.html#rule50]. "

"Forced: At the end of the quest phase, if no progress was placed on the current quest this phase, place 1 progress on the current quest (bypassing the active location)."

It looks to me like there's a passive trigger at the end of the quest phase that ends the side quest being the current quest, and this will resolve before the Forced effect with the same timing, in a similar manner to Sneak Attack  or Eowyn's +WP going away before tests created by a Forced effect "at the end of the quest phase". So the "current quest" will always be the main quest, sidequests or not.

Good thoughts. I've sent a message to Caleb as it seems rather murky.

Looks like naverag is right. Caleb's response...

 

A side quest is only considered the “current quest” until the end of the phase, so the main quest would once again be considered the current quest as soon as the end of the phase triggers. Since the ability in question triggers “at the end of the quest phase” that means the main quest is the current quest for the purpose of resolving its effect. Therefore, you must place 1 progress on the main quest even if you placed progress on a side quest that round.
