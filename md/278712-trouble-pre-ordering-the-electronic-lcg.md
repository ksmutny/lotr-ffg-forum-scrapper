Every time I try to pre-order the Collector's Bundle for the new electronic version of LotR:LCG I get kicked to a screen "Internal Server Error".Â  Regardless of trying on PC or iPad I get this message. Anyone else?

I haven't had the problem. FFG should fix it soon. If not, you should probably email them.
