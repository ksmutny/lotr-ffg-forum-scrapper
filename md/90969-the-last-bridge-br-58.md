Travel:

The first player must reveal the top card of the burden deck and resolve that card as if it were just revealed from the encounter deck to travel here.

Does the revealed card go to the encounter discard pile or back to the burden deck?

When you complete the scenario in campaign mode any burdens in the encounter deck stay with you in future scenarios, so i want to make sure this card goes to the right place.

If it goes to the encounter discard pile then you will always get at least one burden at the end of the scenario..
