When Pursued by Darkness is dealt as a shadow card, it directs you to put an exhausted ally back into your hand. If you only have one ally in play and it is the one defending the attack that got dealt the shadow card, what happens? According to the wording of the card, it would be ok to move that ally back to your hand, assuming it is the only ally you control at the time. If that happens, what happens to the attack? Since the shadow effect occurs before the attack itself, does this effectively remove that ally from combat and potentially save it from the discard pile if it would have been killed? Thoughts?

 

Thanks!

 It does save the ally from being killed, but then makes the attack undefended.

PbS as Shadow card for the Hill Troll when you're defending with your lone exhausted ally, Gandalf, is always "fun" demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] ! Bye-bye hero turn 1.

I would like to see this entered into the official faq, not slighting the forum experts, but IMO I disagree with the ruling here.  The monster attacked, the attack was defended, the shadow card resolved... 'poof' defender goes back to hand and monster swings at empty air.  Is my timing off?

 

In any event, add this card to the faq especially because it is in the core set.

No need. The explanation is already there in the Core Set rule book (p. 18):

"If a defending character leaves play or is removed from combat before damage is assigned, the attack is considered undefended."

 Precisely what happens when Pursued by Shadow is dealt as a shadow card. An FAQ entry isn't necessary here.
