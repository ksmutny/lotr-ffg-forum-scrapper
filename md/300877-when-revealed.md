Hi All

 

ive gone back through the forums as we havent played for some time and im confused (yep easily done).

The encounter deck reveals one card per player. This is known in the game as “staging.” These cards are revealed one at a time, with any when revealed abilities being resolved before the next card is revealed.

We have always played that we go in player order and the card belongs to that person resolving one at a time - now im not sure. Do the when revealed effects affect each player?

Yes the revelead cards affects and can be responded to by all the players together. Perhaps you are thinking of the Saga quests, where the staging step is indeed done with one card for each player (and if that card has the Peril keyword only that player can respond to it)

Thank you so much!!!

Yes we are playing the Saga - that answers so many questions...

I appreciate your quick response.
