Hi, all,

 

I am playing the "The Lonely Mountain" Scenario.

 

For a burglar attempt, the rules instruct the first player to shuffle his deck and reveal the top card. What happens to the card revealed from the deck?

 

Does it get:

a) discarded?

b) put back on top of the deck?

c) put into the player's hand? But then the action on "The Lonely Mountain" wouldn't make sense (spend two Bilbo Baggins resources to tak the revealed card into your hand)

d) anything else?

 

Sorry if this question has been addressed before. I had a look through the Forum, but couldn't find anything related to this.

 

Many thanks in advance for your help,

 

Agesilaos

Burgling atempt does nothing specific other than reveal the top card so answer B, don't do anymore than what is written.

Okay, just goes to show that no matter how long you play this game, you discover something you've been doing wrong.  In this case, I was following option a, thereby losing out on cards I could otherwise have used.

 

But reading the above I have to agree that b) is the correct way to play it.  As supporting evidence, consider how Keen-eyed took is worded:

 

Response: After Keen-eyed Took enters play, reveal the top card of each player's deck.

Action: Return Keen-eyed Took to your hand to discard the top card of each player's deck.

 

If "reveal" included discarded, then there would be no need for the action clause.

You can also interact with that "revealed" card without changing its status as the "revealed" card, making it very easy to successfully burgle with some card combos.  I asked a question and got an official response awhile back, and you can read it in an old thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/87288-burgling-card-draw-deck-manipulation/?hl=burgle].
