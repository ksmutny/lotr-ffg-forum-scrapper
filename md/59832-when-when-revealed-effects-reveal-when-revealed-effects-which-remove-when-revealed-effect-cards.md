Yeah I did that overly complicated topic-name on purpose demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif]

On to the point though. I´ve been playing the Flight From Moria quest in a 2-player game a few times now and during game the following scenario happen: We commit characters to quest and then flip the top quest card to side 2B which turns out to be "a wrong turn". We´re thus instructed, as a when-revealed effect to reveal a card per player (2 players) and add it to the staging area. The very first card revealed in this way is "new devilry" which has the when-revealed effect that the current quest card must be shuffled into the quest deck and a new quest card must be revealed.

Thus technically we must remove "a wrong turn" before it´s full effect has been implemented since we must follow the  new when-revealed effect as soon as we can. Will this mean that since "a wrong turn" is no longer the active quest that the rest of it´s effect (revealing 1 additional card) would be made void or do we continue drawing cards to fulfill an old (and perhaps obsolete at that point) card instruction?

PS: we opted to keep drawing cards because we didn´t want to cheat angel.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/angel.gif]

Any and all thoughts are welcome

 Interesting question.  I haven't played that quest yet but I would play it the same as you ie. that it says to draw 2 cards (2 players) so you have already drawn the second card when you come to read the first.

 Yes you still revel all the cards. the when reveal effect says draw a card per player. So revealing a card that changes the quest card dose not effect that in any way ?

All true except that revealing cards from the encounter deck is defined as "reveal the cards one at a time". Thus you completely solve the effects of 1 encounter card before moving on to the next

Is it on purpose that you have a question mark following your statement? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]

Yes, you do need to reveal all cards. The "when revealed" effect happens instantly. It does´t matter that the quest card changes.

If, for instance, the next quest card would also tell you to reveal 2 cards, you would first reveal the two new cards and then the second one from your first quest card.

I must refer to my previous comment to your question then: was the question mark put at the end of your original post by mistake or design? (judging by your demeanor Im guessing, by mistake gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif])

my english is not to good, it is meant to mean "this is what I think, I think it is correct, do you guys disagree if so how" I get a lot of hits about being to blunt when I do not see myself as like that, so instead of using a full stop as a statment, the question mark means I am discussing it.

You should ask Nate, he is very responsive.
