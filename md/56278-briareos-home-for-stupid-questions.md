Here is the thread where I will post all my idiotic questions that could probably have been answered if I just thought about it for another minute or looked in the rules and faq a bit more. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

1.  For solo games the only main rules difference is that during the quest phase you only reveal one card from the encounter deck.  Everything else works the same?  (obviously some card effects are pointless in single player or can only target yourself.  Ranged is pointless for example.

2.  For cards like Forest Spider which reads (FORCED: After forest spider engages a player it gets +1 attack until end of phase) does that mean that the spider gets +1 reguardless of who engages the player or the spider during a check?  Another example is I believe that Hummerhorns only does 5 damage to a hero when it engages during a check not if the player choose to engage correct?

3.  Now for a timing question.  Only reactions can respond to an effect right?  If eyes of the forest is revealed during the quest phase the players cannot play any event cards they can afford before having to discard them right?

1. Correct.

2. It does not matter who chooses to engage. The rulebook explicitly states that when an enemy is engaged it is said to have engaged the player and the player is said to have engaged the enemy regardless of who initiated the engage.

3. Yes, only responses can be played in response to something. Otherwise actions may be played using the timing chart in the back of the book.

I love the title of this thread.

1. Yes - during staging, you reveal 1 card per player from the encounter deck.  Every single other rule works exactly the same when you have only one player - the only thing to keep in mind is that with few exceptions, certain abilities (i.e., ranged, sentinel),  don't really provide any benefit in solo play.

2. Forest Spider gains +1 attack strength on the round it engages a player no matter who engages it, or whatever the reason may be (i.e., optionally engaging it or it comes after you/whomever because you meet its engagement threshold).  Hummerhorns does 5 damage to a single hero that the player that it is engaged with controls (the other player suffers no injury).

3. Here's a link to a good timing sequence flowchart [http://tinyurl.com/c6wj8ro].  "Actions" and "responses" are different, and typically only "responses" are reactionary in nature, i.e., there is a triggering event, and you can play a response in reaction to it if it.  An example would be A Test of Will - you reveal a treachery card during staging, and while you cannot normally take "actions" at that time, you are entirely free to use A Test of Will's "response" to react to the treachery card by canceling its "when revealed" effects.  In your specific example, you could use A Test of Will as a response to cancel Eyes of the Forest before it causes players to discard all event cards (i.e., A Test of Will), from their hands.  Think of a "response" as an "interrupt" effect, whereas "actions" are just general abilities that aren't quite as quick to occur.

If you have any other questions, I'm sure everyone here should be glad to help out!

edit: beaten, ****!

Svenn and Lightdarker beat me to it but I'm not deleting all of this so you get a double whammy.

1. Keep Ranged in mind for Journey to Rhosgobel. Some of the critters in that scenario can only be attacked or defended against with Eagles or Ranged characters.

2. Forest Spider and Hummerhorns effects would apply at any time that they engage a player. If either one were to return to the Staging Area and then Engage a player again or if they switched from one player to another through any card effects, their effects would apply again when engaging again.

Son of Arnor is the best example of this. If Son of Arnor is used to pull Forest Spider or Hummerhorns away from one player and causes them to engage the person who played Son of Arnor, their effects would apply when they engage the new player. Forest Spider would get +1 Attack strength again for that first engagement phase that they were engaged with the new player and Hummerhorns would deal damage to a hero.

Optionally choosing to engage an enemy doesn't avoid the enemy's effects. Optionally choosing to engage is just a way for players to grab particularly dangerous enemies that might be heading for another player during the upcoming engagement checks or for a solo player to grab an enemy that wouldn't be engaging them this round automatically during the engagement check step due to the enemy's threat cost vs. the players threat total.

3. No, you could play that Spirit event card to cancel the "When Revealed" effect on the Treachery Card as far as I'm aware. So Events can be played in response to cards being revealed. Otherwise that particular event would be useless as there would be no window for it to ever be used. As far as I know off the top of my head, as long as you can pay the cost of an Event, you can use it in response unless it specifically states that it can only be used in certain Phases.

Events can NOT be used as a response unless it contains "Response". This is the same across all cards. Even event cards have "Action" or "Response" on them letting you know when they can be used. However, typically if a card would be beneficial as a response it will have the "Response" tag (such as A Test of Will).

For correcting me, I'm going to use Second Breakfast the next time a Treachery Card is revealed and I have no attachments in my discard pile.

It's pointless, it's illegal, and I'm going to dedicate the playing of it to you.

This is important to keep in mind because doing something like this would NOT be a legal play:

- A treachery card is revealed during staging

- You play a Dwarven Tomb to return A Test of Will to your hand (illegal - you have no "window" to play regular actions, only responses)

- You play A Test of Will to cancel the "when revealed" effects of the treachery card

Ok on forest spider.  It only gets the bonus the round it engages.  If it lives to the next round and stays engaged to that player the next conflict round it won't have the bonus right?

Hummerhorns:  If I choose to engage it then it deals 5 damage to my character?

Correct on the forest spider.  

 

Hummerhorns: 5 damage to a hero, not just any character =P.

Sorry that's what I meant.  My question is it doesn't matter who initiated the engagement :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 Also, keep in mind that when a card like Hummerhorns (or Gandalf), says "deal damage," this is not reduced by the recipient's defense strength value.  Hummerhorns almost always insta-kills a character if you engage it (although there are some ways around this, like Citadel Plate, using Dunhere to kill it, etc).

 I'll probably establish some sort of record with TWO stupid questions at once...

 

1. Does anybody know whether it's possible to beat published adventures using just the base deck and the hero/player cards found in the corresponding adventure pack? I'm a very lazy player and don't want to spend any time optimizing decks and choosing cards (nor searching the web for "well-constructed decks"). So, has anyone tried this? Any opinions/statistics?

 

2. In my (very limited) experience, the game is hard at the beginning of the quest, but it becomes progressively easier as it progresses, due to having more resources/allies/options at disposal, and so on. As a consequence, the initial hand and the first draws have a disproportionate importance on the adventure outcome. Has anyone tried to "adjust" this problem? My personal suggestion (completely untested!): give some free resources at the beginning (e.g., double the initial resources) and then progressively less as the game progresses (e.g., just 1 resource/hero every other turn from turn 5 or 6 on). This kind of change should probably be calibrated to keep the total amount of resources very close to that of FFG's rules, do you agree?

Any thoughts? Other suggestions?

 

Thanks for any answer!

I just got this game after Christmas (because nobody gave it to me as a present) so my experience is also limited. Anyway, it seems to me that the game designers understood the importance of the first hand and that's why they allow a redraw for your starting 6 cards if you don't like your first hand (the mulligan). Having not played any other FFG games, that may just be a standard rule, but to me it offsets the importance of "first draw" just enough to be acceptable. Is the game still hard? Absolutely. But I think the random element is something that must be accepted if you play card and dice games.

As for free resources, I don't think that solves the problem because there are two limiting factors at the beginning. One is resource availability, as you've mentioned, and the other is card draw, which you alluded to. Gaining extra resources will help you to afford the cards in your starting hand, but you would also burn through them much faster and you'd be starved for cards the duration of the game unless you had more card-draw abilities (which I typically don't as a Spirit player). To "solve" the problem you'd have to add more resources and more cards to draw during the resource phase. Do I think these changes would ensure a win? No. But I think winning would be much easier. In games where you had a good starting hand you would dominate the encounter deck and to me it would feel like a hollow victory.

1. yes it is possible, some are harder than others, a core spirit deck can wipe emyn muil and dead marshes easily, however on conflict at carrock for example not so much

2. as stated take a mulligan, its there so feel free to use it, im not sure about being hard at the beginning, as often more and more encounter cards a revealed as the game progress, especialy if you fail to free up the staging area, so often it can be MUCH harder later, and become in fact impossible, but i dont see a fast and hard rule of easy beginning/hard at end or visa versa

Hope nobody minds if I use this thread for my own noob questions. I've been reading up on the game for a few days now, it'll be arriving tomorrow, and I'm quite excited to get started.

1) Just how important is getting a second Core Set? I'm coming from playing A Game of Thrones, and for that game, the standard advice for every new player is that purchasing a second Core Set is the first thing you should do after the initial investment. Successful deck-building isn't all that possible without the extra cards from that second set. But the AGOT Core Set is almost entirely singletons, so you don't really end up with nearly as many extraneous cards with that purchase. Once I've played with my Core Set enough that I'm comfortable with the game and ready to make a bigger investment, should I be aiming at the Core again or are the Adventure Packs a higher priority?

2) Are there any online resources for the game that I should be aware of? Obviously there's this forum, and I've been using cardgamedb, which I already knew well from playing AGOT. I've also found lotrlcg.com, which is nice but quite out-of-date, and I've been poking around the Boardgamegeek boards a bit as well. Anywhere else I should be looking?

1) - Yes.. if you enjoy the game get a 2nd set. If you really like it a 3rd set is worth it. This is also true if you are playing in groups and need to field a 4th or 3rd deck. I have 3 sets

2) - CardGameDB.com is probably the best place for deck lists. People post deck lists here but they get lost as the FFG forum is so terrible. The site is not usedas much as it shoud be but it is there. It also has a online deck editor and a card database. These guys do a LOT for the community behind the scenes, it is prety trragic that peopel ignore his site.

lotrlcg.com is also very cool card database and sister to the coc one at http://cthulhu.dbler.com/. [http://cthulhu.dbler.com/.] It looks semi abandoned but you should see a revivel of this site during the early months of 2012

Also check out the Lord of the Rings Deck Builder, it is a must have for serious players. - http://eric.minet.free.fr/index_en.htm [http://eric.minet.free.fr/index_en.htm]

Then there is BBG file section. - http://www.boardgamegeek.com/files/thing/77423 [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/files/thing/77423] - this is where you will find new rule sets, cutouts for card storage and custom quests. Also there is the card template files here for making your own cards. I prefer these to the card maker application that is aroudn I do not havde a link for that.. but i do know it used gekoths templates in that app. So if you have photoshop..better jst to yes the raw pds templates yourself.

Hope that helps! Have fun

i would say the packs first....depends if you have the money to waste on many cards you arent going to use from a second core set....you can quite comfortably win the quests with 1 core set and the corresponding adventure packs

OK, just sat down with my newly arrived Core Set. And I had my ass handed to me. Mercilessly, aggressively, and consistently. And this was just the first quest. Played several games with the basic monosphere decks. Tried Lore first off. That went poorly. Tried a few aborted games with Spirit, still not going well. Switched to Leadership, did a bit better. But that's not saying much. In all of these games, I never once got past the first stage of the quest; most of them, I didn't get any progress at all. Started working on two-sphered deck. I never touched Tactics for whatever reason, but I tried pretty much every combination.

After several more failed attempts, I stumbled on a deck that finally worked. Leadership/Spirit, with Aragorn, Theodred, and Eowyn. I got very few allies out over the course of the game; a couple Guards of the Citadel and Gandalf twice, once with Sneak Attack once paying for him. The key to victory seemed to be that I was able to quest with pretty much all my heroes every round, and most would be available for Combat later on, particularly once I got Unexpected Courage onto Theodred.

I had one major question from the game. I got a Forest Spider as a Shadow card at one part, where I had Caught in a Web on Aragorn and Unexpected Courage on Theodred. I chose to discard Caught in a Web, but I wasn't entirely sure that was a legal move. The rules state that "Players always assume control of attachments that have been played on their characters," so I did control Caught in a Web, correct?

Figured out part of the reason I'd been struggling so much with my first games: I'd thought that engaged enemies returned to the staging area during the Refresh phase. A couple more questions:

In terms of card effects, does "engaging" referring just to the act of an enemy moving from the staging area to engage a player? Specifically I was wondering about Forest Spider's Forced -- "After Forest Spider engages a player, it gets +1 ATK" -- that bonus would not be active if it attack a round later after already being engaged?

I was also a bit confused by a bit in the FAQ, the second paragraph of 1.11 "Limitations on Attacks:

"Characters are not limited as to how many times they can participate in attacks against the same enemy, provided each attack can be legally declared, and the character is ready and eligible to be declared as an attacker."

What exactly does that mean?

ah well that will make things easier for you...yes engaging refers to when an enemy, or the player engages each other, the spider would only get the +1 when it engages you, and not the rounds afterwards....however if it  were sent back to the staging area and re-engaged then it would get the +1 for 1 more round again

 

this last bit has led to some confusion...it basically means that you arent limited to how many times you can attack 1 certain enemy, as long as its a valid move..so you can only attack an enemy once per turn, and as many characters you want can participate in said attack, but with a card like quick strike, you can attack in in other phases, i.e. the planning phase, then obviously attack again in the combat phase

It should also be pointed out that an enemy is considered to engage the player and the player is considered to engage the enemy regardless of who initiated it. That means even if you choose to engage the Forest Spider, they still get the +1ATK that turn.

OK, new question regarding the word "engage," but a whole new tense. Feint's effect: "Choose an enemy engaged with a player. That enemy cannot attack this phase." "Engaged" includes both enemies who have just left the staging area, and those that have remained from a previous round's engagement check, correct?

I might be overthinking things. I'm used to FFG's syntactical particularness in AGOT, I figure understanding the nuances of card language will be pretty key to playing this game as well.

Still working on finding a deck that can beat Journey Down the Anduin. Did get to the 3rd stage in one game, but **** it's hard not to get overwhelmed with enemies.

Hope nobody minds if I use this thread for my own noob questions. I've been reading up on the game for a few days now, it'll be arriving tomorrow, and I'm quite excited to get started.

1) Just how important is getting a second Core Set? I'm coming from playing A Game of Thrones, and for that game, the standard advice for every new player is that purchasing a second Core Set is the first thing you should do after the initial investment. Successful deck-building isn't all that possible without the extra cards from that second set. But the AGOT Core Set is almost entirely singletons, so you don't really end up with nearly as many extraneous cards with that purchase. Once I've played with my Core Set enough that I'm comfortable with the game and ready to make a bigger investment, should I be aiming at the Core again or are the Adventure Packs a higher priority?

 

 

 

I've been playing with a single core set for a while without issues, and a number of good cards come in pairs anyway. I'd aim for adventure packs after that, and keep an eye out for a site called the 13thfloor if you're from the UK, as they are likely to be selling single cards, and these guys come highly recommended! Excellent customer service.

So, stick with a core set for the first few quests, then consider adventure packs! My take is unless you're really hard-core about getting duplicates of specific cards, you've damaged the set, or want a 4 player game, don't go out of your way for another core set.

I think I stuck with 2 thematic spheres for this one, having Eowyn for quest committing and 2 leadership heroes. It's partially just luck of the draw too.

"Characters are not limited as to how many times they can participate in attacks against the same enemy, provided each attack can be legally declared, and the character is ready and eligible to be declared as an attacker."

What exactly does that mean?

 

 

 

When a character has attacked, it exhausts, and is then ineligible for further participating this round.
However, certain cards can ready a character back from their exhausted state, making them ready to attack again.
So as long as you have the means to keep readying a character after it's exhausted you can keep on attacking with them, even if it's on the same enemy.

Although the text can seem a little confusing, the whole, "can be legally declared" mainly comes down to certain cards barring characters from attacking, even if they are ready, as well as only being allowed to attack enemies you are engaged with, (unless your Dunhere or have a 'ranged' attack)

you can not attack the same enemy twice with the same card, but UC allows you to attack multipul enemies with the one hero.

This is incorrect, as booored pointed out. A player is only allowed to make a single attack against an enemy with which they are engaged unless another card specifically allows it. Simply readying a character does not then allow you to attack the same enemy again, but you could use that character to attack a different enemy.

I eventually cracked the quest. I think my biggest problem was I had been using fairly high threat heroes, which meant I had to engage the Hill Troll right away, which just increased my threat even further from all the excess damage. I switched over to a low-threat deck, and I've had good success with a Spirit/Leadership/Lore deck. Been using Eowyn and Theodred consistently, and mainly started with Denethor, but last night I gave Beravor a spin and things sped up considerably. The biggest problem so far is that it can take a me a while to build up enough allies, so it's a slow turtling approach. I've beaten the quest twice with Denethor, and that took 18 and 19 turns each time, while playing with Beravor got me down to ten.

There are such things as a stupid question. Point and case. In high school my Chemisty teacher made the same statement at the beginning of the year. A couple days later, a chick in my class ask him and I quote "If I (she) slept with every guy on the planet would I (she) get a STD?"

My teacher just looked at her, looked at the rest of the class and went back to teaching. He didn't let her ask another question the rest of the year.

Since others have already answered your questions, I would just like to point out that cards with the Ranged Keyword aren't useless in Solo play.

You can for example use Rain of Arrows, which deal 1 damage to each engaged enemy by exhausting 1 character with ranged.

there are also enemies that can only be attacked or defended against with eagle or ranged cards
