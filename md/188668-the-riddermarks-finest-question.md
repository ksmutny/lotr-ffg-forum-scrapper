If an active location has 2 tokens on it and requires 3, is the spare token (1) of  Riddermark's finest action placed on the current mission card?ffg_the-riddermarks-finest-thoem.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_the-riddermarks-finest-thoem.jpg]

1st let me say that I totally read this forum title as if it was the finest question coming from the Riddermark.

 

2.  No.  It must target a location and a location only.

1 - Sorry...

2 - Why isn't the general rule of questing applied here (meaning that the extra tokens are placed on the curren mission)?

Because you are not placing progress as a result of questing successfully, you are directly placing progress tokens due to a player card effect. The player card states that you can add 2 progress to any LOCATION, if only 1 is required then the other progress token is discard/wasted and does not overflow onto the quest.  It does not use the general rule of questing as you are not questing and it can happen at any time you can use an action not just during the quest phase.

In short, the two tokens are placed at the same time, meaning the location has 4 progress out of 3 quest points and is then discarded.

You're just looking at it backwards, Gandalf196.   When you quest, the only reason you're putting progress on the location is because the location is blocking the quest.  Clear the location, and your hard won progress-- which was intended to be placed on the quest in the first place -- is allowed to go there.  With a card like The Riddermark's Finest, your target is the location itself, not the quest card, so there is no rule in place that would designate extra progress going onto the quest card once you clear the location.

So it's the same for Asfaloth?

Yes.  Any effect that places progress on a location will not overflow to the quest card. 

 

However, card effects that place progress on the quest card would place all progress to any active location first (unless it specifically said to bypass the active location).  If the active location was explored due to this progress, any overflow progress would then be placed on the quest.

Thanks! I think I was playing it right (because I always think that if a rule makes things too easy, then it's probably not the way to do it in LOTR LCG...).
