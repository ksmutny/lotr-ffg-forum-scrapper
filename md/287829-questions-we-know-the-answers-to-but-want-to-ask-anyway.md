Sometimes we know that just because something isn't explicitly laid out in rules, it's pretty clear what is allowed and not allowed. I figured this might make for some fun laughs but also dig a little deeper into our understanding of the language of the game and point out some important key details.

I'll get us started.

1. If you are playing in Saga mode, and you promote a unique ally to hero using sword thaine or prince imrahils ability, can you add that hero to your pool without incurring the +1 threat penalty?

2. Is the quest phase the only time the encounter deck gets reset unless explicitly told to reset the encounter deck by a card?

3. Does master ironsmith allow you to play guarded cards without guarding? What if the card was guarded, attached, unattached and discarded somehow, and then master ironsmiths ability triggers and you choose the guarded card?

 

Any other game-breaking questions and situations are welcome!

1. I like the idea, but I don't think having a hero in play at the end of the game allows you to add their name to the list of heroes you are using. There isn't a mechanic to do it. You can only add names per campaign rules between quests, at which point you're doing so by selecting cards from the card pool, not from an active game.  😕

2. Yep!  If that deck runs out in the combat phase, you get some attacks from enemies without shadow cards. It's nice.  

3. Unfortunately we've had rulings recently which clarify that there isn't a way to 'cheat' guarded cards into play.  The dwarf card 'Well-Equipped' allows you to attach a card to a dwarf in play.  I guess what happens is that the card will enter play attached to the dwarf (?) but then you'll have to get a guarded card, remove your attachment from the dwarf, and attach it to the guard.

1) I don't think you can add that hero.  Worse yet, the fallen hero penalty depends on a hero being in the discard, so if you had Prince Imrahil [hero] in the discard play and then played Prince Imrahil ally, Imrahil would still be a fallen hero despite a hero Imrahil still being in play.  (Full disclosure -- I've decided to ignore the fallen hero penalty for the self-discarding Caldara, rather than having to Fortune-or-Fate her in every quest).

2) Don't player cards that interact with the encounter deck force a reshuffle if necessary?  For example, if the encounter deck was empty during the planning phase, I don't think you can play Guarded player cards with impunity.

3) Master Ironsmith covers the resource cost, but not the Guarded cost.

Thats what I figured. For example, during roam across rhovanion, we ran out of cards while dealing shadow cards, and we were engaged with urdug while his horn was attached. It prompted to discard the top of the encounter deck when he attacks and adds the threat of the discarded card to his attack. 

I think the rule should stand (as far as I can see) that the encounter deck is not auto reset ONLY when dealing shadow cards. Again, not an explicit rule but then otherwise there seems to be breaking the spirit of the game.

Like I said,I think we all know the answers to these questions but they're fun to ask anyway.🙃

Well, as long as there is no viable card for guarding in the deck, you will get it for fre.

With Urdug you would get a free round (no reshuffle).  As you said in your original post, you only need to shuffle the encounter deck outside of the quest phase of a card effect explicitly tells you to do so.  The Guarded X keyword explicitly tells you to do so.  Urdug’s horn doesn’t.

What if a travel cost prompts to "discard until..." or to "reveal an encounter card"? Are these ignored as well?

The travel effect you're thinking of is probably worded something like "Forced: After <this location> becomes the active location, discard cards until..."   In that case, you would discard until the deck is empty, but don't reshuffle.  (that technically would not be considered a travel effect either, since it does not have the bold text 'Travel:').  If the card says "Travel: Discard cards until..." I think you would have to discard cards until the deck is empty. Then, if you did not find the right type of card, you couldn't travel there, since you did not successfully pay the travel cost.

If the cost is worded "Travel: Reveal an encounter card," then you cannot travel there while the encounter deck is empty. You would need to successfully pay the cost of the card before physically moving the location card into the active location slot in your playing area.  But it's going to be rare when you have an empty encounter deck during the travel phase, since the quest phase immediately precedes it and, if the deck got emptied at that time, you would have reshuffled it.

You can't partially pay a cost. So the "Travel: Discard cards until..." situation is very odd. If are facing the situation where you can't, in fact, paying the cost work you are supposed to roll it back until before to try to pay the cost. It is as odd to get back the cards in a reformed encounter deck (in the same order? reshuffled?) but feel closer to the rules.

The effect that instruct to reveal an encounter cards, or discard until you find a card X have an implicit instruction to shuffle the encounter deck if it is empty until recently I'm right? I guess we will get back to this situation who feel way more adequate.

Another interesting one came up. Let me first ask a question one way and then give you a strategy I had in mind:

Suppose many actions trigger that stack progress on a single location IN THE STAGING AREA. (So, maybe in a 4 player game, there are 12 northern trackers that more than clear a location). Excess progress is discarded correct?

 

Okay, if so, can you use Backtrack to remove ALL disadvantageous progress from a quest card (provided that theres no keyword)? Such as Hrogars hill, if it were progress instead of damage?

You can remove progress tokens with backtrack. The rules doesn't care about if those progress are or not advantageous.

I also think that you can remove way more tokens than you can put on the location (so removing 30 progress tokens is possible).

Are you sure? Player actions/responses don't trigger simultaneously. I think once a location has enough progress to be explored it is discarded passively before more player card effects could be triggered.

On one hand I think that since theoretically all characters are commited to the quest simultaneously all the responses that trigger when a character is commited to the quest should came in play basically at the same time (even though between each instance there is time for the activation of Forced effects and passive abilities; see below)

On the other hand I am also of your advice regarding the fact that when a location has enough token to be explored is discarded as though by a passive ability (which if I am not mistaken take precedence over Forced effects and Responses).

You are right. But this is still coherent with my ruling. You choose the X when playing the card, removing X progress from the quest, then you try to put X on the location, it has enough and get discarded but the excess progress aren't put back on the quest.

Alone -> All trigger happen one after the other. You should trigger one, resolve it and then only then you can choose to trigger another.

Yeah that's basically what I wanted to say, but also in my opinion since the triggering events are simultaneous I don't think there should be time to have any effect not at Response or faster level come into play between each Northern Trackers Responses.

I wasn't sure if you tell how this SHOULD be done, how you effectively play, or how you understand the rules.

So yeah, by the rules they don't happen simultaneous. One happen after the other. So many forced, passive effects or other response can take place before. Location cleared are one of those passive effects, forced effects when place tokens are another one. And finally response when a location is cleared are also another one. As the game is design since there is no stack, not enough delayed mechanic there is no other way.

We can deplore that making every effects happen one after the other make the game slower, and don't help us to have a better sensation of being in the universe but they just are a necessity for deal with the many interactions in the game. 99% of the time you can play without it but the 1% is enough for making them essential.

Basically I found that sometimes that "you commit all characters to the quest simultaneously" can create more discrepancies than if we commited them one at a time.

I don't really have an opinion about that. It is to me one of the few ruling clear enough now. I recall having to change multiple times how I have to deal with theodred resources because we wasn't sure how it work but he have been years that we know we can't give it to players who play after us. So I'm fine with sending every active player character, trigger their effects one by one, then do the same for 2nd players...

Oh, haha! For some reason I thought backtrack removed progress from locations in staging to the quest and that you were saying progress beyond the location's quest points could be moved to the quest card. My bad.

Just because you commit them simultaneously doesn't mean you trigger their responses (like Northern Tracker) simultaneously. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I always thought I had to use a Response as soon as possible after the triggering event and if I pass up the opportunity I can't do it later on. Like for example if Player A (which is the first player) commits his characters to the quest amongs which there are some Northern Trackers I have to use their response straight after I send them to the quest, if I pass it up and let Player B commit his characters to the quest, which again can have some Northern Trackers amongst his allies I can't for example activate the Responses from the Northern Trackers of Player A and Player B all one after another in a big block.

Allowing one-by-one character committal represents a buff to characters like Firyal and Longbeard Elder, as now you'd be able to use the info from the scry to tweak who you're going to commit.

Committing one at a time also nerfs things like the core Aragorn-Theodred interaction—if Aragorn has no initial resources, they would not be able to support each other.

Whether these kinds of side effects are OK is to some extent a matter of taste, but the rules, and rulings, have always been quite clear on the designer intent.

Couldnt you commit theodred, trigger, get resource for aragorn, then commit aragorn, then trigger his response? That's kind of how I played it.

So, correct me if I'm wrong, but it sounds like what you're doing is:

1. Choosing a list of characters you're committing with ahead of time.

2. Iterating through the list, committing each character individually as it comes up, and for each time a Response is relevant, doing it right then.

This is not unreasonable. But, it is not what the rules say to do.

To me, it is somewhat akin to people discarding shadow cards immediately after the enemy attack resolves. They learned the game doing it that way, 99% of the time it doesn't affect anything compared to the Correct Way, so why bother changing? That's anyone's prerogative, but they should know that it does occasionally have a functional effect.

I am not disputing the meaning and intent of the rules (nor do I play differently), simply that even though there are situations where the rules' approach is more balanced and useful, at other times it can cause "issues".

@Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/] are you referring to the travel cost question?

The situation I wrote about, “Travel: Discard until...” was hypothetical, I’m not sure if any card exists like that. Maybe one exists which says “Travel: Shuffle the encounter discard pile into the encounter deck and discard until...”.   If that happened, and you still couldn’t find the type of card you were lookjng for, I think maybe you would just travel to the location for “free” (other than the “cost” of discarding cards from the deck). That’s opposite from what I said earlier , I’m not that sure about it.  But the recent ruling about Sting makes me think that way. 

If you play Sting and there is no enemy in the encounter deck, the rules tell you infinitely reshuffle the deck and infinitely discard cards.  Caleb rules that you would do the effect as completely as you could: discard til deck is empty, reshuffle, then discard til empty again. At that point you are sure that there is no matching card type. So, you stop reshuffling and attach Sting to your character. So maybe a travel effect worded in this way would work similarly. 

I don’t think you would reshuffle the encounter deck for that effect though, since it’s during the travel phase. Only if the card actually tells you to do so.

I think you are wrong.

1. is ok

2. Send everyone ON THE SAME TIME questing.

3. Resolve a trigger among them, and if occur, any response forced of continous effect linked (like: give a resource with Theodred and immediatly do Heir of Mardil on the selected character)

4. Resolve another trigger (like, now resolve Aragorn with Theodred resource)

Okay that's roughly how I play it, but then that locks in the idea that the northern trackers put one progress on each location, one at a time.

You are correct that responses must be done ASAP after being triggered, but the cannot be resolved simultaneously. That makes things like this legal:

Yes, you could. Even though the characters are committed simultaneously, you must chose the order of the resulting responses.

If you play Mithrandir's Advice from the top of your deck with hero Gandalf, does he count towards your heroes with a printed lore icon?

I would definitely say yes, almost in the same vein of how you can play A Burning Brand on him when you play it from the top of the deck

There is a difference between A burning brand and Mithrandir's advice : Mithrandir's advice need a printed lore icon.

 

But Gandalf is considered to have a printed lore icon when playing the card, so yes, I think its works

Yeah, that's why I sail "almost". Gandalf's effect covers both the more restrictive "printed (X sphere) icon" and the less restrictive "(X sphere) hero" situations, and so forth.

I am just wondering if the "considered" is only for the sake of paying for the card and not playing the card. Like is there a lapse between the payment and the play where gandalf switches from all printed resources back to neutral?

I might also ask about the effects of "considered to be engaged" with dunedain effects. Are they triggered as well, even if enemies are not actually engaged? What about immune enemies that stay in the staging area and are considered to be engaged? I'm thinking about Halbarad and amarthiul.

Gandalf would be considered to have the printed sphere throughout play of the card. That would include paying for it and adding it to the board, resolving its effects, attaching, etc.

Enemies that are "considered to be engaged" would trigger those effects. As for immune enemies, Halbarad hero and Amarthiul would still work; since their abilities affect themselves. Ally Halbarad targets the enemy itself though, so his ability would not function against immune enemies.

If you are in the middle of triggering an effect, but then realize the only way to complete the act is detrimental to you, are you allowed to cut it off mid-action? (My guess is no -- you started it, you finish it).

For example. You play "Open the Armory.", its Valour action, which states to search the top 5 cards of your deck for a weapon or armor and put it into play. You look at the top 5 cards and see that you only have Orcrist, a guarded weapon attachment. Not wanting to trigger the guarded keyword, you forgo putting anything into play, lose Open the Armory card, and just shuffle your deck. Is this allowed? Or is the player committed to putting the weapon into play?

The rules reference on Search says:

Since it says "may", you don't seem obliged to do it. On the other hand, it would seem perverse to decline to find e.g. an enemy from the encounter deck if a Treachery tells us to find one, and the rules don't distinguish between Searching for such cards and Searching for player cards, so who knows.

I think for sanity's sake, the "may" in the Search entry can be read as follows: the entry is providing an algorithm for executing the search instruction. "If the player finds a card that matches… the player may add…" is saying: add said card to the set of valid ways to resolve the effect, but you can keep searching. (Thus the "may", which prevents the player from being forced to resolve the effect using the first card found.)

Once you have searched all the relevant areas, though, you still must resolve the effect, if possible.

Well then now this gives rise to another issue. I think may should imply optionality. I think may in the instruction manual implies something different than the may of a player card. For example, last night we played Ithilian Lookout. The response is to look at the top card. If it's an enemy, you may discard it. We didnt want to discard the enemy in question, but we did want to look at the top card. I think it was a legal move.

Perhaps the instructions should say "...instructed to search for a PLAYER card..." but then we return to my original question about being forced to play a guarded card.

I think this is precisely the heart of the issue: "may" in the RR is not necessarily the same as may in card text.

This applies to all words—another example is "reveal"/reveal. In RR Staging, "reveal" shows up in the RR as part of the explanation of Staging step #1  to denote the simple act of turning the card face-up. But this is a slightly different use than when reveal shows up in card text, which is also defined in the RR. Confusing at times, but probably inevitable when you're using English words to explain rules text which is also in English.

(Your play with Ithilien Lookout is indeed how the card is intended to work.)

I'd say O Lorien's minimum one restriction references the extent of its own effect and does not affect the ally's cost itself. So yes, in my book.

I think a similar question has been asked before and the official answer was that combining "reduce to a minimum of 1" and "reduce to a minimum of 0" can get you to 0.

Of ancillary interest, as I do not believe this has been reproduced on the forum before (this was shared on Discord in 10/2017):

If you search the top 5 cards of the encounter deck with The Hidden Way [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Hidden-Way-TWH] and find no location, does the card whiff entirely? Or do you still resolve the "then" effect?

You do not resolve the 2nd sentence because of the semantics of then:

This "then" is new to me. It seems, that I are playing house rules here. :)

Especially, because the "then" starts with a new sentence. For me it sounds like "do first, do a second thing, afterwards".

I am used to a different wording from other games: "do X to Y", where Y is a positive thing and X some sort of cost. That would be much more clearer - at least for me.

What you describe is how then works in, say, Android: Netrunner.

But the RR way listed above is actually how it's always worked in LotR, or at least it dates back a long time: FAQ v1.1 from 2011 has the first "published" clarification (item 1.15).

I would say you actually don't shuffle your deck. You didn't fulfill the first part to completion (you still search you deck whether he's included in it or not, but of course you can't put him into play, so the "then" does not take effect.

That would be true, except the rule is you always shuffle after you have searched your deck. See the FAQ 1.21. In this case, the "Then" clause on Fili and Kili is redundant.

The ruling on "then" states only to shuffle, when the other dwarf has been brought into play. Thus i would interpret this as do not shuffle without the second dwarf.

I mean, it brings up a good point. Many cards just have the tagged on "Shuffle your deck." At the end of a card text (without the word "then"). The inclusion of "then" is a bit particular but I don't think the intention was to omit shuffling if you couldn't find the dwarf. I think it I'd just another case of inconsistent language used over the years.

You are correct, I paraphrased. However, for these cards it is not logical to interpret that you shouldn't shuffle. The absence of an instruction to act does not equate to prohibiting the action. "Unless a card effect says otherwise" would require an explicit instruction that you don't shuffle or to do something else instead. 

In Fili and Kili's case, you don't have to follow the "then" clause, but you should still follow the FAQ rule to shuffle because there is no contradictory card text.

Ally Galadriel is an example of such an exception because after searching the top 5 cards you are instructed to put them back in any order. 

I don't know of any card that would currently let you search the whole deck without shuffling and quite possibly there will never be one.

It would be logical to shuffle after such an effect takes place and it probably is just an inconsistent use of game terms as @player3351457 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/328421-player3351457/] points out. Someone once said to me, when in doubt always take the harder option and thus I probably would shuffle anyway. Nevertheless, as the rules stand now, I see it as legal play not to shuffle.

There are not many player cards that allow a (partial) search without specifically asking for a shuffle: Bilbo [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Bilbo-Baggins-THOtD?Lang=EN] and The Red Arrow [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Red-Arrow-BtS?Lang=EN]. But in both cases, the FAQ would kick in and require shuffling. Mustering the Rohirrim [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Mustering-the-Rohirrim-THfG?Lang=EN] on the other hand also uses "then" like Kili and Fili.

Yup. RR Restricted [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule585] says:

In particular, the first sentence mandates that you can't keep that 3rd restricted attachment once the contract no longer applies to the hero.

My wiggle room was on the verb "attached." Meaning the process of attaching the attachment. Not already attached.

The Elevenses FAQ [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Card1700] states ' "Play only after the staging step"… means it is only playable immediately after the staging step ends.' (This is a play restriction in RR parlance.)

The analogy for Arrows from the Trees would be, "Play only after making engagement checks" means it is only playable after making engagement checks.

So if you do not make engagement checks (say, Journey down the Anduin's stage 2B), you, well, do not make engagement checks, so you have not satisfied the play restriction for Arrows, and you cannot play it.

(Yes, I can see someone arguing that Arrows' "play only…" text literally just means, "Play only during the 5.3A action window, but it doesn't matter whether 5.3 happened or not." But I doubt that's what an official ruling would say.)

This is precisely why I asked the question haha

I'm not sure that Elevenses FAQ is quite relevant here, since it only fixes the action window where Elevenses can be played.  If the staging step included no actual staging via quest card effect, you could still play Elevenses, I think.  The trouble I see is that Arrows doesn't say to play after the engagement check step (which would fix the aciton window), but after *making engagement checks*.  If you don't make engagement checks, then I think you lack the pre-requisite.

This means, I think, that not only a quest effect that skips engagement checks could prevent playing the card, but that if player cards prevent all the *individual* enemies from making an engagement check, it can't be played.  There has to be at least one enemy that made an actual engagement check.

Suppose you play ally Saruman and select the active location.

1) after questing successfully, do you bypass the location when placing progress?

2) can you travel to a new location, potentially having two active locations next turn?

Saruman says, "After Saruman enters play, choose a non-unique enemy or location in the staging area…"—the active location isn't a valid choice.
