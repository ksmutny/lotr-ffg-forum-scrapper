Can I attack Forest Spider in PTM quest right away with Dunhere at the start of my turn dealing 2 damage to him, and then quest, travel to Forest Road and attack with Dunhere again, killing the spider?

Dunhere´s ability does not grant him the ability to attack outside the normal Combat-phase. Thus he cannot attack Forest Spider in the Quest-phase, unless empowered by another card effect.

Furthermore, when you do make an attack, you normally exhaust the character(s) you use for attacking. Making the character unable to participate in further actions that require him to exhaust (attack/defend/quest/certain triggered abilities). Dunhere has no inherent ability to make him overcome these limitations.

Thanks.

 

Im not a new player, and I know you can only use one action for each character, but Old forest Road reads that you can ready a character so if dunhere would be able to attack before combat phase, I would be able to deal 2 damage to spider before I traveled to the Forest Road and then I could travel to Forest Road, ready Dunhere, and then attack again killing the spider.  If I remember right in the rule book it says that text's that arnt in bold or anything, but just plain text, its a lasting effect.  So I assumed that since Dunhere's ability is plain text, He could use his ability anytime.

 

Thanks again,

Khamul

Dunhere's ability is a constant effect, which means that whenever he is eligible to attack, he can attack an enemy in the staging area if he is attacking alone.  The important part is whenever he is eligible to attack.  His ability does not grant him attack ability outside of the combat phase.  So you can only use him to attack when the normal game rules allow you to do so, unless other card effects change that.

Ah had forgotten that part about Old Forest Road. Though you´d still need some other effect (like Quick Strike) to be able to declare an attack with Dunhere before the Travel-phase

OK and one more question, Quick strike only works in the staging area with Dunhere right?  If you use quick strike on Legolas, he would not be able to attack an enemy in the staging area right? Just an enemy engaged with him?

He would not be able to attack an enemy in the staging area, but just an enemy engaged with the controlling player or another player, since Legolas has the Ranged keyword.
