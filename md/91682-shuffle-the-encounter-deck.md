When I am told to shuffle the encounter deck, does that mean the discard pile with the remainder of the encounter deck?  Thank you.

They are shuffled separately. From the FAQ:

> 
> (1.21) Search Effects
> Whenever a player searches through a deck, that player shuffles the deck after searching it unless a card effect says otherwise. Players do not shuffle or change the order of a discard pile after searching it.
