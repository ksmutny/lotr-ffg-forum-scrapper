its not always about bosses thuogh- return to mirkwood is still pretty **** hard for solo play due to its terrible design with 1 player. rhosgobel is also pretty luck based still

conflict/hfg/dead marshes are all easier and lets face it, emyn muil was easy to begin with

the first cycle still remains my favourite though  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
