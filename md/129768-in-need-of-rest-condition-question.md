This treachury card has that "Remove a Hero from the quest and attch In need of rest to that hero ... "

Â 

What if I have no hero commited to the quest (playing solo), I just discard the card and it does no harm?

Hello to everybody,

I have the same question.

If I have not commited an hero to the quest, does the effect of this treachery trigger and is it attached to an hero in any case?

Thank you

And you'll have the same answer :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
