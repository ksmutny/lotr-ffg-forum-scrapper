I am requesting the help of the community out there to get LotR running in OCTGN!  I know there is an instruction page with the game feed, but because of security settings at work, I can't access that page and I can't find the information reposted anywhere - just people reposting the link to the site I can't access.  And on the tutorial video, the resolution isn't high enough to make it out!  

 

Can anyone just give me the URL for the game feed?  Thanks!  BTW, I am a veteran player who collects the physical cards, so this is not a call for pirating!

As long as there is an OCTGN thread...

How can I play two handed in OCTGN? I've seen Seastan do it so I know it can be done. TIA

Open OCTGN twice. It'll say there's another copy of OCTGN already open, do you want to close, obviously click no. Don't log in. Start a game, you should be able to see and join it from the other window (failing that you should get it by clicking "Join unlisted"). Voila, you have two windows in the same game. Then you can either repeatedly switch between windows to control your two decks, or pick one window and then after loading your other deck and taking a mulligan if you want, right click on each of that deck's heroes, hand, deck and discard pile and take control of them. Then you'll be controlling everything from the one window - in this case however you will have to manually draw cards for the second deck by dragging them from deck to hand - CTRL+N won't do it, and CTRL+D will only affect the deck you loaded in that window. Also if you do a random discard from hand it'll always go to the discard pile of that window's deck, regardless of which hand you were discarding it from.

I should have tried it. Sometimes the obvious answer is right.
