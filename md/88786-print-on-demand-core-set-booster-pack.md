# [Print on Demand Core Set booster pack](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88786-print-on-demand-core-set-booster-pack/)

Dear FFG

 

LotR LCG is one of my favourite games, but the card ratios in the core set are so frustrating. Could you please consider releasing a Print on Demand booster pack that contains extra copies of all the cards of which there are fewer than three copies in the core set?

 

I, for one, would happily buy such a product to get play-sets of all those cards. I know many players have shelled out for a second (and even a third) core set, but I have a limited gaming budget and I primarily play solo. As such, a second core set represents limited value for money for me (and wouldn't even get me full play-sets). Being able to pick up those cards alone would add to my core set deck-building options without breaking the bank.

 

I hope you will consider my idea as a cost effective solution to what is a relatively common player gripe.

 

Whitman

 

PS: Thanks to richsabre, who suggested moving this from the Print on Demand section to here.

I hear you, as many other probably does. But it will never happen. First, FFG doesn't really read this forum that often, but one could always hope I suppose. Maybe if they stumble upon the subject enough times. Secondly, the majority of those needing a "full set" happily bought/still buying a second or third core set. When the hard core players wanna do that there really is no reason for FFG to make any PoD packs with just the "missing" cards. Also, PoD cards are slightly different in quality so they would stick yout from the rest of the player cards. But for what it's woth, happy hunting :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

i for one would welcome this, however it is problematic using POD cards with ordinary cards without sleeves.

 

it also probably asks the question of why not just put the extra cards into a new edition core set.....well, answering my own question i guess

1. it would annoy all those who bought extra core sets (myself included) and

2. ffg would be losing out on the cost of printing, unless they increased the core set price which isnt a good idea i think.

 

....or perhaps it is. is an increase in core set price for the extra cards better than having POD sets?

 

the increase in core set wouldn't help those who already have the core set, so i think that POD sets are probably better, so those who want the extra ones and want to pay for the can get them.

 

overall i would want what you suggest, though i think its going to be tough getting it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I've heard that the PoD cards are different in quality, but I can't tell the difference between my Laketown cards and my core set cards (apart from the smell). Are the PoD cards thicker, perhaps, or more prone to printing errors?

 

Cynically speaking, if there is an appreciable difference, that means more people buying sleeves (which I don't currently use). Not a bad outcome for FFG.

 

I don't know what your card pools are like, but are there any cards from the core set that you still use? Steward of Gondor, perhaps? Or Unexpected Courage?

yes, quite a lot of them. given i am a theme player i never really have the problem of older cards being replaced, but even so i think ffg has done a good job with keeping older cards more useful...and of course new combos are coming out that give old cards new life such as small target and dark knowledge

 

as for the POD cards, the ones i have are very much different, feel and look....and they seem 'rounder' at the edges, so i would have to sleeve them (which i do for my decks, though i never used to)

Finding new synergies for older cards (especially those which everyone will own) is one of the great thing about the LCG model, isn't it? With games like M:tG, the core sets are often underpowered by comparison to block level cards and decks.

 

As for a Deluxe Edition Core Set, I think you're absolutely right. I wouldn't buy it for the same reason I probably won't buy a second core set. With a PoD release, they keep newer players happy at minimal expense to the company.

I play with a group that varies from 3 and 8 players. Of the 8 of us, only 3 actually own any cards but among those 3 we have 6 copies of the core set. 

 

Before I bought my own set of cards I bought a core set to donate to the "collective card pool" 

 

In order to avoid being crass and not being willing to spend an additional 40 on top of the 80 I've already spent on core sets, once I began accumulating my own set... I just printed off a few color copies of Dwarven Tomb and Unexpected Courage for the times I'm not playing with my buddies.

 

This technique does require using card sleeves, but I find card sleeves to be an advantage in general. My wife set Mirlonde in a pool of condensation the day I bought her -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png] If only I'd had a card sleeve ready to go when she came out of the package

I don't think we'll ever see a PoD pack for the "missing" core set cards for the simple reason that FFG knows, if you really want those cards, you're going to buy a second (and third) core set, which gets them much more money than they could charge for a PoD set of, what, forty-odd cards? 

 

And that is all I am going to say on the subject!

All wives should come with card sleeves, especially if you've gone to the effort of buying one. And, of course, a proxy is never as good as an actual wife!

I think almost all the best cards in the game are in the core set.

How good would the spirit sphere have to become for these cards not to be worth including? Unexpected Courage is so awesome.

My 12 year old son tried to play with my unsleeved cards once while he was eating a huge bag of Wotsits (they're like cheesy poofs, for those outside the UK). "One does not simply wipe one's cheesy fingers on one's t-shirt and then pick up my LotR cards," I told him. He replied that I am too old to do memes. 

 

So, yeah, I'm coming round to sleeves.

Thanks Whitman, I'm glad that you like the blog. I need to make a second attempt at Stone of Erech, playing it with four players and without knowing what the scenario entailed was fun but very difficult.

As much I would love a core set "booster", I really dont think its going to happen.  This has been an issue since the game came out, and there isnt that much incentive on FFG's part as the hardcore will (or already have) buy more core sets.  And theres another population of players that just proxy the cards.  So while the booster may sell, it assuredly wont make enough of a profit for them to be worth it.

 

Besides how much would it cost? They probably make way more every time someone makes the dive and buys that 2nd core set than for every 4-6 copies of the booster they would sell.

Yes, I agree, with all that has been sais so far. This problem was already being discussed before the game even came out. What drives me mad is that some of the Core Card sets are so strong (i.e. Unexpected Courage, Test of Will and a lot more) that I cannot imagine how they will ever not become an option when building strong and efficient decks.

 

Just one point I wanted to raise - since nobody else did this - is about environmental / waste of ressource concerns: I will never buy a second or third core set just because it is such a waste of material. I know few people are concerned with this probably and one could argue that CCGs / LCGs as such are quite un-ecological (considering the ressources consumed for cards and that cards are printed in China and then shipped around the world a number of times), but for me there is at some point really an ethical question involved:

Can I reconcile sitting on /throwing away all the encounter cards, double heroes, extra box and threat counters for those comparably few extra cards that I again?

 

Personally I cannot. Because I think at some point I have to admit that even though I am not doing a favour to the environment by collecting cards per se, I just cannot get myself to buy additional cards that are attached to such a vast waste of resource.

 

That said, FFG should consider doing these "Second Breakfast" (really like this idea) Core Set Expansions as part of their CSR programme - without having an direct economic profit in mind for that one time. Since, this is not a problem unique to the LotR LCG, it can actually make a change and shows that FFG cares about society and environemnt!

 

That's just my five cents, though ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png] I know we will never see this happen...

I would be interested in both, a booster or an enhanced core set (since I currently have my old german core set, this would provide me with an excuse to change it finally xD. Buying more regular core sets was never an option for me).

Well I've bought four core sets thus far, and have kept all of the encounter cards but sold everything else - even if I didn't have a use for multiple threat trackers, or wound tokens to the point where they're coming out of my ears, I suppose there is always someone who would want extra stuff. I've also got the three additional core boxes as back-ups, like Rich says, in case something happens to my "original" core box. Or in case the card pool expands beyond the limitations of being stored in that one box. So all that I've thrown away from these is the cellophane wrapping  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Also, if you get three core sets you don't throw away the extra encounter cards. Now you can pre-build mane quests so you don't need to mix and sort the encounter sets so often ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

I agree that FFG are already profiting from the card distribution in the core set, so there might not seem to be any incentive to "fix" it. But they could gain a lot of goodwill by appearing responsive to fans of the game -- this is the ship that Paizo have been sailing so successfully, after all, which WotC have tried to jump on with their extended D&D open play test.

Would the "Second Breakfast" make more money than FFG make from second (and third) core sets? Maybe not, but some of those core sets are being bought by gaming groups or friends who intend to play multi-player, so the cost to the consumers is shared. The "Second Breakfast" option is for poor solo gamers, like me, who can't even persuade their Lord of the Rings loving partners to play elaborate (and sometimes fiendishly difficult) card games. Products that respond to consumer demand produce a less easily identifiable profit in the form of brand loyalty.

For someone just getting started with this sort of game, the Paizo Adventure Card Game is likely to be an alternative. It doesn't have the LotR factor, but it's a similar enough type of game. It doesn't seem to suffer from the play-set flaw, however, and has been designed with the consumer's needs very much in mind. The box, for instance, has been designed to store the adventure packs as they come out over the course of the year. There's a pack of extra characters, for those who want to play with bigger groups or to play a wider variety of characters -- including this in the Paizo core set would probably have raised the price, just as including 3 copies of every player card would raise the price of the LotR core set. Instead, Paizo have responded to a sub-set of their fan base (i.e. large groups and those who prefer the less traditional character classes), and have produced an additional product just for them. Collectors will also buy it, so this isn't an exclusively community-related move, but addressing consumer's needs with a specific product is a fairer choice than saying "just buy a second core set".

Don't get me wrong -- I love this game. And I understand that incomplete play-sets mean FFG can put a greater variety of card effects into the core set without jacking up the price. (In the interests of balance, at $60, Paizo's core set is a bigger outlay than FFG's.) Greater variety enables FFG to better establish each sphere's identity. It also leads to greater variety when playing the game -- sometimes you win with Unexpected Courage, sometimes you have to win with weaker cards. That's all well and good for a core set, but players who move beyond that first purchase will probably end up wanting 3 copies of Unexpected Courage (and 2 more copies of Gandalf for their buddy).

Environmentally, the obvious solution is an app. This too, unfortunately, runs counter to FFG's existing model. Why fill your den full of cardboard boxes when you could just fill your device's memory instead?

That's the idea. You could then do some actual deck-building with the core set, instead of just cutting a few cards from your pool or running slimline decks. Maybe include a page of deck-building advice in the box, too.

## 35 [player1761766 on August 20, 2013](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88786-print-on-demand-core-set-booster-pack/?do=findComment&comment=845087)

So, realistically, FFG couldn't charge more than £12 for this hypothetical PoD pack, because that's how many cards the APs have. Without talking great economics, the purchase of two additional core sets to get these cards gets FFG between £50 and £60, depending on where you bought these core sets. 

 

What company is going to produce a product that loses them a minimum of £38? How would that be good business sense? 

 

I live in the UK, hence why I have used £ instead of $. Also, I realise I said I wasn't going to say anymore on this matter and just have, but this subject annoys the hell out of me and I couldn't control myself.

Your price point seems reasonable (unlike your footnote). I already addressed the potential profits to be gained from increasing brand loyalty by responding to consumers in an earlier post.

Sure, we're not talking mega-bucks (or mega-pounds), but we're also not talking about a huge outlay for FFG. You might also take into account the reduced cost of producing a PoD booster, as opposed to a core set, which presumably would lead to higher margins on the booster.

Well, you should do some market analysis to definitely answer this question. How many players buy extra core sets? How many will buy a 12$ "Second Breakfast AP" ?

 

However, in a pure economic sense, core sets, since they need no additional development and printing cost on FFGs part, since they will keep printing them anyway. Although more players might be willing to buy a "Second Breakfast APs" it probably will not be enough to cover extra cost development and production of such an expansion

 

Personally, I was hoping that there will be "reprints" of some of the major core set cards, at least the ones that were only included as a "one of". The, you just need to buy two core sets, which provides you with good resources for a 4 Players group.

You're right, of course. Apologies for sounding unreasonable. I find this topic so frustratingly redundant because FFG has stated for years now that they are happy with the way the core set was produced, and have no plans to implement such a thing. There are many threads in the past, both here and on bgg that I know of, that have discussed this. The idea of "completing" the core set is, at best, a pipe dream, and no matter how well-reasoned and respectful the arguments in favour of this hypothetical product may be, the company's stance has been given before, and referenced many times thereafter: it's not going to happen. While it doesn't count for much, I personally wouldn't have thought this particular issue is such a concern in terms of brand loyalty - overall, I would think the overall game experience by far transcends such concerns as "if only I had another Unexpected Courage", for example. 

 

This distribution model has many times over been held up to give the lie to FFG's 'LCG promise', but the answer will always be the same. Overall, buying three core sets and thereafter one of each expansion is always going to be cheaper than, say, staying current with Magic.

You're not wrong about M:tG. Last I checked, a full play set of just one core set would set you back something like £650 if you bought a re-pack. And WotC release four sets a year (including a new core set, often with duplicate cards). This is just one reason that my gaming budget now goes to FFG, rather than WotC.

 

Of course, you're also absolutely right about the major source of brand loyalty here. This is a LotR tie-in that does the franchise justice in spades and would be a **** good game without the Middle Earth factor. People are going to buy it, and so they should. 

 

Pipe dream is probably right. FFG have far bigger fish to fry than this particular sardine (like milking X-Wing to the MAX, based on their in-flight report). But a man can dream, right? Admittedly, it's not a particularly ambitious dream. My 3 year old son dreams about pirates and Batman -- why can't I have his dreams? Instead, I'm stuck with this futile fantasy of having three copies of some cards without paying for two boxes of stuff I don't need. 

 

Thanks for your patience and I appreciate your comments.

Great stuff, rich. Goes to show there's a fairly even split between those who will and those who won't buy more than one core set. From reading some of the comments, it seems like a few players bought multiple sets for gaming groups or playing with family and friends, who I guess would still want to have multiple core sets.

 

I might include something like this in my LotR LCG blog (when it's up and running), to probe a little deeper. (After all, who doesn't like a little deep probing, huh?)

 

Since posting this thread, I've also seen numerous similar threads, along with Chris Peterson's justification for the core set's card distribution. I agree with his points about diversity of card pool and initial price point for new players. But why single copies of some cards? With 2 copies of those cards, you could have everything you'll need from 2 core sets, which is a lot more palatable than 3 core sets. I'd understand if all the single cards were unique, expensive allies, like Beorn or Brok Ironfist. But Unexpected Courage? I guess this way it stays unexpected...

thanks. horn of gondor was always one of those cards i couldnt see why there was only 1. sure it was unique, but during the core set it was hardly a power card...i mean we got 2 copies of steward, which is one of the most powerful cards in the game

 

interestingly, now with the recent cycle's focus on allies leaving play, the horn is becoming much better

The poll was of people that read this community. So it's a biased response by definition

 

I daresay the ratio of those that bought more than one core was closer to 15%

Yeah I agree with the gripe about the cards we only got one of.

 

6 copies of a lot of cards might be reasonable if you've got a regular group of 4 players (like we did when we started) but with 3 sets you move into 9 copies of a lot of cards and then they're just reaching trash status. 

 

Personally we fixed this problem by giving the main organizer 3 copies of every card while we got the spares. So I have 3 copies of anything there was 2 of in the core set but only one of the others. Things would have been a lot simpler if there had just been a requirement of 2 cards minimum. That way you'd have the right number if you bought 2 core sets - which we had to do anyway to move up to 4 players. 

 

Again, I fix this problem by printing and sleeving the only 2 cards I want that badly - Dwarven tomb and Unexpected courage.

My point has no insult to Rich at all.

 

If he knows statistics then he knows that who you ask and what you ask (or what correlations you are looking for) makes up a very large segment of how much utility there is to a given batch of statistics.

 

So by saying that of the people that read this LOTR community that 50% bought more than one core is something I have no problem with. To say that 50% of the people that bought LOTR LCG bought more than one core set is a leap of faith not backed by the poll.

 

Fair?

 

And yes my 15% was a guess and I believe I couched it in those terms.

Of course, rich's sample is based only on a sub-set of players and is too small to support any general conclusions. What is arguably more relevant in this case is qualitative data -- the reasons people bought just one or multiple core sets. This would give a far better idea of how much money FFG could make (or lose) by coming up with a "Second Breakfast" booster.

 

For instance, if a significant number of people bought multiple sets for gaming groups, FFG stand to lose less money than if the people buying multiple sets were all "hard core" completists. How many people bought one core set and then moved on to other games? How many people, from both camps, would buy a booster given the chance?

 

FFG already know their sales figures. Some quantitative data (e.g. how many sets each player owns) is certainly useful, but without qualitative data, it's all just numbers and guesswork.

 

Even with all the right data, however, FFG seem disinclined to make such a product. You know what might change their minds, though? A Kickstarter campaign. We would need to know how much it would cost FFG to put together this product, then raise that amount of money. We could come up with stretch goals for bonus content, such as extra heroes or quests, alternative art cards or easy mode cards for the core set quests. What do you guys think? Has this been discussed before?

It's a very creative idea. But what we really need to know rather than how much it would cost to produce is how much money FFG would loose. Say it would cost $10 000 (have no idea at all) to produce but they might loose $100 000. I think they'd pretty much turn down the $10 000. Also, it's hard to make them fix something they don't see as "broken". They are satisfied and the majority are satisfied, at least enough. I have no figures to back this up, but if you look at all that is planned in the near future you can see that the game is going very well. It wouldn't dothat if people was unsatisfied. Anyway, I doubt that any attempt to do a kick starter campaign would just end in nothing.

Not to be the voice of gloom once again, but during the Q&A at the In-Flight Report from GenCon this year, Christian categorically said Kickstarter campaigns are not the way the company is going to go.

I still maintain that the reason to buy a second core set (aside from completion-ism) is to allow for 3 and 4 player games. (Which otherwise requires additional components from outside the game as well as a lot of expansions).

As a result I still think the optimal choice for FFG is to create a dedicated 3-4 player expansion, with three new quests, and new player cards that are designed to be more beneficial to multi-player than single-player (like campfire tales). The quests would be designed to be most enjoyable at 3 and 4 player (though ideally still suitable for 1 player, I feel we could do with some quests that really work at the higher player count). The quests should again include easy/medium/hard.

As a bonus this new multi-player set, that's designed to compliment the core set, should include the missing 61 cards from the core set. This can be done to help keep the price down since reprinting from another set is cheaper than designing new stuff; it also will be possible because the 3-4 player expansion wouldn't need to support an adventure cycle. It would get some token sheets and two new dials though.

It could be priced at the same point as the core set (despite having less new card designs because of no need to support a cycle and 61 cards being reprints + maybe more gandalfs). It could even be priced a little higher (if the core set is marked down to increase sales). I believe this product would sell to all collectors, and to many groups that consider a second core set.

I certainly think that a casual player might consider this product but would never get a second core. I also think that it would sell to people who already have even 6 core sets. The price ( the same as core or a little higher) with the increased sales I believe would be the best way to offset the loss of core sets. (Equally I think as time goes on the number of people that ever intend to buy a second core set that haven't already got it will dwindle, but this new product would certainly entice purchases).


Sadly I don't think we'll see it, but I think it's the right thing to do.

I hear you. In addition to production costs, we'd need to know what proportion of core sets sold were second or third (or fourth...) purchases, and how many of these were bought specifically to "complete" one player's collection. A bigger sample than rich's would help, as would gathering data from more than one place (maybe from multiple web-sites and blogs). This would give us some indication of the money FFG might lose.

 

It would also be helpful to know how many people would buy such a product, what stretch goals might induce people to purchase such a product, etc. This would help us gauge how much money FFG might make. 

 

That's a lot of data to collect, which we would probably need to persuade FFG that the "Second Breakfast" booster is worth pursuing. (Obviously, we couldn't run a Kickstarter campaign without their blessing.)

 

All of that said, Spalanzani is quite right to point out Chris Peterson's reservations about Kickstarter (as expressed in the In Flight Report). Although he stopped short of saying FFG would never use Kickstarter, he was pretty clear that he didn't want to use Kickstarter as a "pre-order" tool, which is essentially what this campaign would amount to. This generated a spontaneous round of applause from the audience, so it's possible that this idea would not only fail to impress FFG, but also FFG's biggest fans.

I respectfully disagree with you ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] you make a good point but bear in mind that it's a 1-2 player game with the possibility of playing 3-4. That doesn't make it a native 4 player game and therefor I don't think FFG should go more specific into that area. If an expansion for 3-4 players the. Why stop there? Why not additional packs for 5-6 and 10-12 players? They have made a game that is best played with 2 players in generel.

I really couldn't say how I feel about this project. 

 

I personally have never supported a kickstarter campaign but my wife and friends have. 

 

If Lord of the Rings LCG DID a kickstarter then yes I think I would support it, even in this case... but I feel they're doing an admirable job of moving forward and I don't think enough of the community would be inclined to pony up for something essentially looking backwards. I could be wrong here, of course... Kickstarter is a great way to go about proving commonly held notions dead wrong, after all.

You know what would be awesome in a set like this? A competitive game mode -- something like the original LotR CCG, where players (or teams) compete to achieve the same objective using different methods. For instance, in the Council of Elrond, everyone has different ideas about what should be done with the One Ring. You could even have less heroic characters, like Saruman, as hero cards (although, given the next cycle is all about Saruman, we might have missed the boat on him).

 

The biggest problem with this set is it still screws solo players (like me). But if I could get those "missing" cards with some new player cards and a couple of new quests, I'd be happier than I would be buying a second core set.

I don't know how they would ever go about making this game competitive beyond what they have done now... outlining rules for essentially racing to the finish. 

 

Plus, I would never want the cooperative element to be overshadowed by a competitive version of the game. I barely play this game solo at all... literally I think I have done 5 games solo ever. Tried Shadow and Flame by myself twice, and tested a Trained for war deck against Journey down the aduin solo three times.

i hear you. Though I don't agree with the competitive mode, but that really is a matter of taste not right or wrong :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] What I don't understand and never have is why people feel screwed, to borrow that word. You don't need the "missing" cards to play the game solo. Really. I have only played it solo with one core set and it great! Even playing solo duo handed is great with just one set. I can understand that because it says in the rules that there can be up to 3 copies of any cards in a deck, they might feel cheated. But it really is only a matter of what the rules say. If it said, max 3 copies except for unique or restricted cards who only can have 1 copy, then no one would really care all that much :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] that and the fact that most people are used to the ccg concept. But as it is stated before, no matter what we think, say or do, FFG will never go back on this one. So we either accept it or don't. And it would look like, without any clue really, that most people accepts it. Else there wouldn't be any growth in the sales and they'd slow down development/releases.

But really, everyone that is participating in this thread do have good and valid viewpoints :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

You could do it lots of ways. In a combat heavy quest, you could take head counts, like Gimli and Legolas do. (You could even have a kill steal event, where you cheekily shoot an orc that has an axe buried in its head!) In something like The Hunt For Gollum, whoever has the most clues at the end of the quest wins. In Laketown, whoever kills Smaug wins.

 

These are minor changes, more akin to bragging rights than a separate game mode, but you could also scale up. You could have a separate encounter deck for each player, for instance, along with event cards that hinder your opponents. You could even have rules for PvP combat. As Mr. Thomas points out, this wouldn't be to everyone's tastes -- one of the things I love about this game is that it is co-operative, so I can play it with my son without suffering a tantrum if I win. But it's an option.

 

Also, when I say "screwed" I mean that I would begrudge buying a set aimed at large groups just to get play-sets of the cards from the core set, when I mainly play solo. A booster would work better for me, personally, because I would just like to have the "missing" cards.

 

All of that said, I'm happy with my one core set -- I still have lots of sphere and hero combinations to try out. And I agree that just because the rules say you can have 3 copies, doesn't mean FFG are ripping me off by not giving me 3 copies of everything in my core set. Limitations are just challenges with an attitude problem.

 

But... if FFG ever did release a PoD "Second Breakfast" booster, I'd buy it. And I'd be absurdly proud that I helped to make it happen. (Unless it bankrupted the company, of course. Then I'd have to find a way to blame FFG.)

the forum wasnt working for me for some reason.....brings me back to the times of waiting 2 hours for a page to load haha

 

i have to agree with mr.thomasschmidt on this one- i don't think ffg will do this, no matter of the support or anything. not that ffg dont listen to their players, they most certainly do (they even made the subforums after i started a petition) but on this one, i think its too much of a 'sticky' area (dont ask me what i mean by that as i dont really know) .

 

what really matters i think is the amount of players who buy the game but dont go further than that i.e. dont post on forums, dont follow the news apart from new release schedules and so on. being so obsessed with this game its hard to imagine it, but i guess a lot of ffg's player base are happy to own and buy the game and leave it at that...im also thinking of the players who have the game and bring it out once or twice per month/year

 

...therefore, it is not even sure how many would join a campaign to get these extra packs. it is also unsure how these 'basic' players would feel about such a thing....im guessing most would not have an opinion either way enough to back it

 

personally it is risky...perhaps just ask caleb outright whitman? you can contact ffg, see what they think...they may say its not likely to ever happen, they may say it depends on sales..i really dont know

Sadly, I can only conclude that you and the other commenters are right, rich. It seems like FFG made up their mind about this a long time ago (in a galaxy far, far away).

 

As for casual gamers, you can buy the core set in Waterstones, but they don't stock any of the adventure packs. If this happens elsewhere, there are probably a lot of players with one core set and big smiles on their faces.

 

Let's just hope the line stays profitable until they complete the Saga expansions, eh? I cannot wait to toe-punt Gollum into Mount Doom.

hahaha- yeah i may throw frodo in with him just to see what happens

i have never actually seen it in waterstones, though in the barren wastes of n.w. england its hardly surprising (though i have seen game of thrones lcg core set....and many other lotr and hobbit things when the hobbit came out)

It doesn't get more desolate than Sunderland, mate. (Just ask the guy who wants to frack the whole north-east...)
