Ithilien Guardian and Celador are commited into the quest when they are in quest. When you gain their control (for example, when you pass to 3a [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Card/Focus/1772]), are they exhausted or ready?

as the card only specifies 'commited' and not exhausted (which we know from light of valinor etc. are different things) then i play them as ready
