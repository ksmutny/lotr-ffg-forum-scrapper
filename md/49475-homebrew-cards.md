Hey is really amazing!!!! Very cool!!!! The art is so nice.  

## 3 [Doom1502 on July 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=495140)

Looks great :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Are the high threat costs of 15 intended for some of the heroes? Their stats don't add up to 15 (I couldn't understand their special abilities, I don't speak spanish)

## 4 [Mighty Jim 83 on July 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=495179)

Really good quality, and nice art-work - did you do the pics yourself?

As the previous poster said, some of the threats seem very high.

Any chance of english translation of these? would be very tempted to try playing with a few of these (especially given the seemingly interminable delay for 'hunt for golum') but I can only make out the gist of most of them, and the people i play LoTR with probably speak even less Spanish than I do.

## 5 [Mestrahd on July 5, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=495192)

They look really nice. They must have some killer abilities to be threat 12 and higher! The only card I really understood was Narsil. If attached to Aragorn he gains a Tactics icon. Pretty good.

these are more or less literal translations into English, if iran is not good because I'm using an internet translator to go quicker

 

put 15 instead of 12 due to the power of that character

## 8 [ArachneJericho on July 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=495511)

Don't forget that some of those actions are apparently limited to one use per round. ("Máximo 1 vez per ronda" or "Limite de una vez per ronda" I think.)

The cards are quite gorgeous.

Nice ideas. I think we can all pretty much figure out what the translator meant. The word "letter" refers to "card", I presume.

## 10 [Mighty Jim 83 on July 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=495705)

I've done some fuller translations of all the cards. Tried to bring them inline with the terms and wordings generally used in the game - i've also dug out most of the Tolkein quotes, although I wasn't quite sure which quote was being used for Galadriel, and I couldn't find the Thrain one at all.

Also, I was a bit unclear about Balin's ability (hence the bit in brackets.)

Filgonfin- is there any chance you could produce English versions of the cards using these translations? I'd lvoe to play with them, but it would seem a shame to do the sort of botch-job I'd have to of adding text using MS Paint or similar for use in English.

----------

Arwen:
Half Elven. Noble
Response: Discard 1 card from your hand to cancel the “shadow” effects of a card just revealed.

Response: Exhaust Elrond to reduce your threat by 2. Limit once per Round.

Thorin:

Attached hero gains +1 [Attack] +1 [Willpower]

Dwarf. Noble. Warrior.
During the Planning stage reduce the cost to play the next Ally Dwarf from your hand by 1.

Celeborn:
Sindar. Noble.
Action: Exhaust Celelborn to search your deck for an attachment and put it in your hand. Then shuffle your deck. Limit once per turn.

Ally
 

Sting: Item. Weapon
Attach to a Hobbit Hero. Restricted
Attached hero gains +1 [attack] (+2 [attack] instead when attacking an Orc.)
Action: Exhaust Sting to discount the threat of one Orc enemy in the staging area this turn.
“A small sword in an old shabby leathern scabbard. Then he drew it, and its polished and well-tended blade glittered suddenly, cold and bright.”
 

Balin:
Dwarf. Noble.
Response: After a Hero suffers damage, add 1 resource to his resource pool (for each point of damage he just suffered).
“Instead there was a very old-looking dwarf on the step with a white beard and a scarlet hood.”
 

Dwalin:
Dwarf. Noble.
Action: Exhaust Dwalin to search your deck or discard pile for a Dwarf Ally and place it in your hand. Shuffle your deck if you have searched it.

With the exception of maybe Thrain II, I don't see why any of those would be 12-15 without the appropriate stats.

## 12 [servant of the secret fire on July 6, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=495790)

I am 99% sure that Galadriel will be an ally.I think the only hero version we will see is yours and that makes me sad.Very nice work mate.

1- the Thrain ´s quote is in chapter [10] A Warm Welcome and Galadriel´s quote is in the Chapter of Galadriel Mirror.

 

2- The ability of Balin is, when a Hero be damaged, you put only 1 resource in the pool of this Hero, NO over Balin.

 

3- At the moment is impossible to create the English version because We are very  busy with work and family and also with other cards for an adventure of moria. But but if someone manages photoshop give permission for the change to English. if not when we finish the whole adventure will try to translate it.

 

when you add new cards also featured the "translation" with a translator

We think that these powers are a bit powerful for a hero, because it would be something you can do in each round.

besides Bilbo for example, the line does not meet either the sum of features is the cost of playing

## 15 [filgonfin on July 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=496164)

Answer: When Days Listed takes damage, that damage reduced by 1.

## 16 [Iver2 on July 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=496167)

Wow, man, this is amazing work! Do you guys actually use those to play the current quests?

btw, guys, after the mirkwood cycle of the 5 announced adventure packs, we there be any more cycles? Any news on that yet? sorry for the offtopic

## 17 [Doom1502 on July 7, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49475-homebrew-cards/?do=findComment&comment=496246)

 Hi Filgonfin,

Which softwares do you use to make those cards? Adobe indesign? I am professional designer. If you give me the original files, I can change it to english.

 

Cheers

Thank you for those new cards.  Art is fantastic.  I have played the original to death and with only one core set I am very hamgsrtinged in what I can accomplish.  I will try those out soon.  I noticed that there are no Tactic cards.  Is that done purposefully or just by coinsidence?

tomorrow we'll link to download all the letters belonging to the adventure of the mines of Moria.

Good for all.

Here you have the link where you can download the full adventure "Mines of Moria", or download part of it (like that to the consumer). I recommend that before you play, and start asking to be around here for many who do not like that to read the manuals, I cast ye out the document with the rules for this adventure.

Of course it is necessary to have the basic box to play in this adventure, but well, that you will see when the descarguéis.

With regard to the novelty that many did not like, to include a istari to help in the adventure, to say that you can play the adventure does not include these letters, but it will be somewhat harder the victory.
