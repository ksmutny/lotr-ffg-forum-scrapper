So if i switch active location with West Road Travelers ability, does any travel costs activate.

 

Example: I play West Road Traveler from my hand and i use she´s ability to switch an active location to necromcer´s pass, which has travel effect: The first player must discard 2 cards from his hand at random to travel here. So if i switch location, does i have to resolve its travel effect?

No, just move them without any travel effect.

It trigger "becomes the active location" though, some have that as a forced effect trigger.

 

Also, west road traveler is switching, and you can't switch a location with nothing, you need to have an active location and another location to switch them.
