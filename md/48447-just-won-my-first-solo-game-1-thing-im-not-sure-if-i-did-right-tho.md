 when you complete the first part of the quest (1a) if there are excess tokens from your last turn, do they carry over? i played that they did, but im not sure if thats right. i won with a final score of 57 (which is a bit crap) but it was also my first ever build as well :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

If there are extra progress tokens on a quest then they are lost when you move to the next stage. See "Quest Advancement" on page 22 of the rulebook.

 This game is so fun!!! Finally beat the first scenario with an all dwarf fellowship. Took Gimli, Gloin, and Thalin. They worked well together! I ended up with a score of 51 overall...I am happy. Gimli had a Citadel Plate on with a Blade of Gondolin, he beasted on the enemies while Beorn defended.  I drew a great combination of cards. Overall the mixing of Tactics and Leadership is great (I look forward to expansions) but it takes A LOT longer to successfully quest while you must tarry beating up enemies as the dwarves have low willpower compared to the other spheres. The good thing about this strategy is that your dwarves are strong enough to kill the heck out of enemies and so they clear the Staging Area faster...thus meaning that the next quest will often be against a clear Staging Area, which, we all know is ideal for a successful quest! Keep playing Tolkien fans, and please, share your game details with me!!!
