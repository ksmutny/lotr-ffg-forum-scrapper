# [Escape from Dol-Guldur: win-loss ratio](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185257-escape-from-dol-guldur-win-loss-ratio/)

Howdy!

 

As per subject, what's your win-loss ratio with Escape from Dol-Guldur (normal mode) and what to you think it's  satisfctory ratio (i.e. something that makes you happy with your decks)?

 

I created two new decks (direct damage Leadership + Tactics and a Silvan deck Spirit + Lore) and so far I'm at 4 victories and 3 defeats. All three defeats were very close calls (I lost the last one for 1 missing progress marker on the last stage), with the Nazgul being defeated every time, yet still I'm not happy. I found out the problem in the deck (not enough drawing cards so that it happens that at stage 3 I have plenty of resources but no cards in hand) and possibly fixed it by adding Ancient Mathom to the mix (I'm using 2x core sets and cards from the first cycle only, and I won't change this until I have 200 plays done), but this made me wonder about what makes you happy with this scenario

 

Thanks in advance for stories shared and comments :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

I'm probably going to be frowned upon for this, but I consider this scenario extremely poorly balanced. It's tough as nails to beat solo, but it's a simple cakewalk with more players. Me and my friends have beaten it with the core set starter decks(!) in a 3 player game, yet it's a pain in the arse if you are trying to beat it solo with a powerdeck.

 

There is a simple reason behind it: fixed 3 amount of cards in the staging area(which is adequate only in 3 player game, in 4 player game it becomes too easy), 3 daunting objectives that hinder you that you must equip(which is easily mitigated by having a lot of heroes in play, i.e. multiplayer). And that's just the tip of an iceberg.

 

I play this scenario solo only when I'm feeling lucky or feeling like I'm ok with getting a couple of my teeth grinded.

 

My win/loss ratio with this scenario is: a few/a lot in solo, a lot/a few in multiplayer.

 

As for the story, I'm afraid I played it too long ago to remember one, but what I remember is that when we've beaten the scenario with the starter decks, there was a Gloin with that Shadow Key objective attached(I think) and a Self Preservation, so it was almost like a second Steward of Gondor  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Why would you be frowned upon for giving your opinion?

Also, I think the consensus will agree with you. I know I do.

It's as you say: rock hard solo because of all the objectives.

This quest was designed with multiple players in mind.

The OP is playing with two decks too.

And as for her question:

I did beat it solo a couple of times at the time before Heirs of Numenor was released, with a Legolas,Glorfindel,Elrond deck.

The ratio is a bit of a guess, but it should be around 25% win I'd say.

Two handed solo would seriously have boosted that.

And as John said, in 3-4 players it's not so challenging.

Me and my buddies actually never lost I think, but we only played it a few times.

Thanks for the answers, guys.

 

Indeed, I'm aware the difficulty of the quest varies quite a lot with the number of players involved, that's why I was curious of general experiences playing 2H / with 2 decks. I played a few more today, so far out of 9 games played, I won 6 times, losing 3. Doesn't sound too bad. Possbly there's still quite a margin of improving, I'll try a few more in the coming days :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Playing SOLO (1 tri-sphere deck), with only ONE Core Set, I only managed to win 3 times out of about 30 games (I think).  The losses are always short games, lossing (or giving up) in round 3 or 4.

 

What I don't like about the scenario is the setup.  You have to draw your setup hand (and have possibly shuffled your deck already from mulliganing) and then have to randomly select a prisoner.  What maybe a 'great starting hand (maybe from mulligan) could turn out to be useless if a hero that generates the resources for those cards in the starting hand is the prisoner.

i do 2 hand or 2 player,   I cant really say my w/l ratio, i havent been keeping track, and I don't play this scenario all that often anyway. 6w and 3 losses out of 9 games seems really good though.   I would say you're on fire.  I usually lose this scenario based on who the captive is at the beginning.   sometimes a hero gets captured that is critical,  or locks you out of a sphere that you need, or something lke that.

I've only attempted it a couple of times so far (solo) and lost each time. 'Losing' a hero from the get-go is what hampers me. Been trying to think of the best approach to it but not tried since I bought my last lot of adventure packs. I should be getting Black Riders soon, so will have a crack with a Hobbit deck and see how that goes.

Only played it solo and with core set cards, but got hammerred every time. Only scenario so far that i have skipped as a solo single hand player.

Once I feel my card pool has grown that I can try another solo single hand i will revisit.

With single handed solo I imagine trying a monosphere deck may work better due to prisoner aspect.

Not going to try for some time yet though.

Hello Julia!

I think if you're playing 2 players with cards from just Core+Shadows, 4/7 looks decent.

Especially if you're playing with thematics deck (Silvan with your card pool is not really a deck that benefits from some trait affinity) I would consider that satisfying.

## 10 [Julia on August 18, 2015](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185257-escape-from-dol-guldur-win-loss-ratio/?do=findComment&comment=1742262)

Thanks for the further feedback, guys, much appreciated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

As for the problem of "no matching resources vs player's hand": true that, but you can

 

a) be sure you quest strong enough to contain the time you have 1 less hero (so far I generally spend 2 rounds on stage 1, and once it happened that I was able to free the prisoner at the end of round 1)

b) work with cards allowing hybrid characters to be generated (by means of Songs, for instance) so that you can actually have a second choice even if the specific matching resource hero is captive)

 

But clearly, soloing this is more of a problem than playing 2p.

 

Thanks Eu ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Indeed, I'm mostly playing thematic. I went with Celeborn as one of the heroes, tho, to give the Silvan trait a boost (not so sure if Celeborn was released in the first AP cycle, so, possibly it's the outsider here). Still, I mostly use Spirit / Lore cards to control the staging area, and allies are mostly played through the Leadership / Tactics deck, so, actually I'm not seeing that many Silvans around :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Ewww i hate this quest...well in solo i have really small win ratio (not even telling you because it's so bad) and in two player game we will win about 1/5 of times.

The pure solo win ratio for Dol-Guldur NIGHTMARE is about 1 win for 268 defeats.

Seriously, it's by playing Guldur NM solo that I learned to loose at a card game.

I think I once played a nightmate dol guldur with core spirit-leadership deck out of despair/for laughs... and won. I don't think I had an encounter draw luckier than that time. Ever. It was literally 0 my impact on the game, just super harmless encounter cards from turn to turn :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

LOL, I'm not at Nightmare level at all (I played only Passage through Mirkwood on nightmare, I won on the third try, but I still don't know how it happened, and I'm sure before I try anything else on Nightmare I'll need at least 1K plays under my belt), and even if I were, I'd be scared to death by soloing DG :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

Ok, thanks :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I made a pool of heroes, and slowly discovering their interactions and abilities (I noticed Celeborn mostly because of Dward King Bronze Beard here). It's a very slow process, but honestly, I'm happy with this, I want to discover the game a tiny bit at a time

I did a project [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178282-solo-deck-to-beat-escape-from-dol-guldur/]a few months ago to try to build a deck that could consistently beat Dol Guldur solo. I defined success as having a win ratio greater than 50%--merely having more wins than losses. So I'd typically say if you're doing better than that, you can safely feel you've "beat" this quest. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

When I bought the core set, we tried it with my wife twice but failed both with no chance of winning. We left it aside. 

 

We tried again after Heirs of Numenor Expansion

 

In a two player game we won 2 out of 3, I remember we figured out there is a strategy if we manage to follow we can make it ok (doi not remember which that was, I think quest hard early on)

 

Then i tried again solo one handed, first in two sphaire deck , failed I think all five tries, then with a monospirit deck (Glorfindel, Frodo and Eowyn ) which lost one and then won next two. Tried a mono lore twice and failed all of them

 

Never played it since then (that was one and a half year back I think).

 

I want to try again with only core set, but to find a mood for this I must be drunk or something I guess  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

It's 50 + 3 heroes, I'm afraid.

Side note: After about a million tries, I finally beat Helm's Deep two-handed... But when I was writing down the decklists for posterity, I found that I'd accidentally fielded one 49-card deck. "49? 49?? That's, like, a shuffling rounding error from 50, isn't it??", I shouted at myself, eager to move onto the next quest. But the rules dictator in me wouldn't let me -- luckily, it only took me a thousand more tries with the corrected decks, not a million. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Thanks. Fixed the deck by adding three Blades of Gondolin (even better, considering Legolas is in the mix).

 

Helm's Deep for me is still something very very very distant in time (possibly 2017) :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I was going to suggest starting your own thread in the decks and strategy section, on my two handed decks thread or even just in this one but john beat me to it. Nice decks! You use the same two sphere combos I use, Lore and Spirit in one deck and Tactics and Leadership in the other.

If you have access to the leadership sphere then one valid option is to include We Are Not Idle. It's essentially a non-card as you can play it as soon as you get it and draw a new card. It allows you to shrink your deck to 47 cards, and is often better than including other cards because a smaller deck allows you to find the important cards quicker.

True that, but it comes with Shadow and Flame, and these decks where meant to use cards (everything but the heroes) from the core set and the first AP cycle

Yup, I like the way those interact together :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

And thanks. These decks are far from being perfect (for instance, the Lore/Spirit deck is slow on resources) but they have some good stuff in it, basically staging area control and some healing / location control and a few combos for dealing damage. There are a few more options with two cores and the first AP to explore (more Dunedain attachments, or going mono-Tactics), but for now I'll play a few more with those

As for posting in the Strategy forum... The main problem is that I don't want help with my decks (unless I specifically ask for it): half of the fun of the game is learning the cards and what you can do with them, and reading comments like "you should add this or that card" kills the fun of discovery out of it. Not that I don't appreciate the knowledge, the skills and the willingness to help, but I like learning the hard way (but if anyone wants my deck, just PM me)

Played one more tonight, with Celeborn imprisoned. Opening turn seemed to be a disaster: I tried to push on progressing to stage 2 immediately, with Thalin, Eowyn, Elrond and Glorfy questing. Found Ungoliant Spawn as first revealed card, and Mountains of Mirkwood. Ugh. 0 progress markers placed on round 1, and Ungoliant Spawn arriving. Moving from stage 1 to stage 2 required some sort of eternity, and I managed to survive due to the Spawn being Forest-snared, and a couple of Feint played at the right time. Still, even with Thalin defeated during Stage 2, I passed to Stage 3 thanks to Legolas with Unexpected Courage and a double Blade of Gondolin. Last round I had the Nazgul engaged on the Lore / Spirit side, with 4 damages on him. Dawn take you all was enough to vanquish the riskier part of his attack, so that Northern Tracker took one for the group, and then Glorfy, Legolas and Horseback Archer finished off the guy, winning a game that seemed to be lost for how it had began.

 

So far 10 games played, 7 victories, 3 defeats at Dol-Guldur. Time to move to the next one :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Using a single Core Set Spirit and Leadership 30-card starter decks, my brother and I played this tonite and won, on our first time to play as 2 players (we've played EFDG individually several times already).  I was surprised to see that we did not have much difficulty.  Did we get lucky, on our first attempt?
