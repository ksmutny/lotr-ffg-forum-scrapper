Hey, 

I was wondering what my next buy should be.  I have been playing for a year now, am a solo player but play 2 handed sometimes too, and have the following expansions: 

 

Shadows of Mirkwood:

Conflict at the Carrok

A Journy to Rhosgobel

The Hill of Emyn Muil

 

Khazad-Dum

 

Dwarrowdelf:

The Redhron Gate

Road to Rivendell

The Watcher in the Water

Foundations of Stone

 

At the moment, Dead Marshes and Hunt for Gollum are pretty much no were to be found.  So take those off the list.  And I am not yet interested in getting Stewards Fear or Druadan, but still interseted in HoN.   What do you guys think I should get next?  If you could list like a top 3-5 or something that would be great.  I am not particularly interested in a certain race. (Dwarves, Gondor ect.)  I am the most intersted in the quest.  But still am interested in player cards.   I'm thinking a bottom 3 would be:

Shadow and Flame

The Battle of Laketown

Long Dark or OHaUH?

 

Thanks,

Khamul

Hey khamul

i would say return to mirkwood….i know i said it was aweful solo play, but thats before i played it 2 handed. its a great quest that way. the theme is great, its a fun quest and even taking dain out of the equation, theres actually some very decent all round cards in there such as dunedain sentinel attatchment and the support of the eagles

the long dark is very easy….which isnt perhaps a bad thing if you want a deck to take it easy on or try out new thematic decks.

i remember you asked perviosuly about HoN or the hobbit expansions. i would say that its not an easy answer, but as i said previously on the thread HoN is very difficult, more so than the hobbit quests. but its fun, peril in pelargir is certainly not too difficult.

do you have massing at osgilliath? thats a great quest- one of my favourites. its not as difficult as it used to be with certain cards. i know my beorn/hama/legolas + flight deck can take it

I would say if you do get HoN, get The Steward's Fear as well, as what you get in that pack will help you immensly with your quests. It won't make it a cakewalk, but it will help you out (Unlike some, I do find no shame in running outlands decks). Also The Steards's Fear has a really cool quest, as it's like The Hills, but better.

I also agree with rich to get return to mirkwood. I'm not too hot on the quest, but you do get Dain, and more importantly, you get Eagles of the Misty Mountains, perhaps my favorite ally card. 

Honestly, the first Saga Expansion is good too. and if you want to be a bear warrior, then that's the thing to get.

Good luck!

@RichI do not have MaO and have heard by many that it's a good quest.  To this day do you still have fun playing it?  

@Zalrus9  Thanks man!  I suppose it would help to get SF for HoN.

yes, very much so. its got that perfect mixture of theme and fighting. and of course you get to face the witch king…that alone is worth it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

So you would rank RtM one of the best for 2+ players?  I just got a freind in to this game which is super cool for me since he's the first person ever that I know that plays the game other than me.  According to hours of research and these 2 answers, I think my next buys will prob be:

Massing

Return to Mirkwood

On the Doorstep - Do you guys think these are some of the best quests?  how are they solo and how are they 2 plauers?

 

Thanks

Khamul

well solo massing and RTM is very difficult….very very difficult with a small card pool, but perhaps better with the newer cards.

on the doorstep is perhaps easier solo. the quests are harder than overhill and underhill. the last one with bolg has amazing artwork.

overall i would say on the doorstep is harder than massing and RTM

Thanks. Are the On the Doorstep quests towards the top of your fav quest list?

yes i would say so..but more for the theme i think.

i have yet to win the last two. i won the first one on the 2nd attempt. i am probably going to re try the other two with the outlands. actually i would probably have won them solo but i like having my two decks. (or 3)


i think on the doorstep has amazing player cards though

I always find these kinds of discussions and things like looking at Forums, guessing new heroes, hearing about quests but do not have them yourself, and all that, being more fun than actually playing the game itself.  Don't get me wrong, I do LOVE playing the game, but sometimes even more I enjoy looking at forums, polls, discussing cards, quests and all the things I said above.  Anyone else think that?

im probably 50/50 on that. when i used to run my tolkienology series in the 1st year i really enjoyed doing those. and i have enjoyed the other lore threads started more recently. and the speculation and of course helping fellow gamers

so yes, i think i enjoy both equally

I agree that I enjoy discussing the game perhaps more than actually playing it, but that really depends on the community. And even then, playing the game more makes me want to contribute more the the community. 

 

That said, I think The Battle of Five Armies is really hard to do solo. That quest will mess you up if you're not prepaired. I think I only beat it on easy solo, and even then I forgot that Bolg gave all goblins surge… so I've yet to beat it…

 

But still, enjoy!
