Let's face it, there  must be a Faramir hero coming down in the Land of Shadow.

 

Considering only the Core+Saga, we are one Tactics and one Leadership hero short.

 

Which sphere do you think Faramir will be? What kind of ability do you want for him? How to make the Trap deck archetype more viable?

I hope he's leadership, but whatever the case he's gotta be amazing in order to replace his ally version. This is almost the same design challenge with Gandafl hero IMO.

Neither Leadership nor Tactics have any Traps, so if Faramir is indeed going to be in one of those spheres - they'll need to include 2 traps of that sphere in the same pack, which I'm not seeing happening.

I don't think they would need to add 2 traps of the sphere, and I don't think they will. With just 1 it's enough, as long as it's good enough to run 3 copies of it. Trap decks don't actually run that many traps, since there's still basic lore stuff that is necessary, and deck space is small. Not to mention that the best trap we have and the only one that really warrants 3 copies is still Ranger Spikes. In any case I really doubt we'll get another lore version.

That's the point. We won't get another Lore version, and I can bet money on that we won't get a trap-related non-Lore version.

Oh totally, that's just assuming he actually works with traps. Most likely he'll be a general purpose hero, and the other hero will work with traps (we were promised traps in the announcement), or maybe he'll work with rangers in general, and we could have a couple more ranger allies.

Or maybe, he'll work with attachments.

Ranger allies would be amazing. We can think they will be unique, as every single ally we were given in the LOTR and Hobbit Saga Expansion was a unique ally.

 

I think Mablung, Damrod and Anborn are the only Ithilien Ranger named characters in LOTR.
