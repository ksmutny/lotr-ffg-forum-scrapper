in Thrones there's a "moribund" state. when characters are killed you can still trigger their responses or actions and trigger saves. in lotr, if a character is killed can i use a heal from an event card, attachment or character to bring his hit points under the max and thus keep him in play?

no i do not think this is something the game has in play ....perhaps in the future....the only card i can think of is frodo, where you can cancel damage and add threat

There is a card in the spirit sphere that will bring a hero back from the dead. Costs 5 resources.

In thrones, you can trigger responses while a character is moribund, but NOT actions.  We have yet to see a heal effect in this game that is a response, so I imagine we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.  The closest thing we have right now is Landroval's ability.

There's also the cost 6 dwarf ally that has the response to be put into play when you lose a dwarf hero.
