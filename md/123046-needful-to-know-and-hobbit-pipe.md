If I play Needful to Know, and a 0-threat card is drawn (or a card with no threat value)... can I still trigger Hobbit Pipe to draw a card?

 

I'm reducing my threat by 0, correct?  So is that still considered reducing one's threat?

 

Thanks,

J

I wouldn't say that this fits the definition of "reducing." I doubt that there is currently any official ruling though!

My thought is that there is no effect if the drawn card does not have a threat icon. I can't remember if we've been given a zero threat enemy or location yet, but if we have then I think your situation would work.

Technically your threat would have been increased by Needful to Know because you raised your thread by 1 and didn't reduced it by any amount.
So if you draw a treachery I would say definitely no to the Hobbit pipe reaction.  A 0 thread card I'm not 100% sure but would still say no.

And have we been given one yet? Nothing is coming to mind, but I don't remember the encounter cards nearly as well as the player cards.

Any enemy or location with a printed value of X would be treated as 0 because its text is inactive while still in the encounter deck.  X's default value is 0.

If I recall correctly many effects in the game aren't triggered whenever the value you opt/have to execute is 0. So reducing by 0 isn't considered reducing,....

Just a mathematical success isn't enough for an effect to be triggered, there should be some 'change' for an effect to trigger.
