Hi

 

I would like to know if someone can help me with a general doubt about events and attachments.

 

Attachment example:

Self Preservation card

 

I know that I need resources from a Lore Hero in order to play "Self Preservation" card but after that Could I play this attachment on a Hero or Ally with a different sphere (Tactics, Spirit, Leadership)?

 

 

Event example:

Beorn's Hospitality card

Once I have played this card, could the action of this card be played on a hero or ally with different sphere (Tactics, Spirit, Leadership)?

 

 

I general the doubt is once I have played the event or attachment , Could the effect be played on heroes and allies with a different sphere?

 

Thanks for your help!

You can generally target any character with an attachment or event.  

 

If there are restrictions, they will be explicitly stated on the card.  The card might say "attach to a hero you control" (can't put it on other players' heroes) or "attach to a Lore character" (can't attach to characters who don't have the Lore icon).
