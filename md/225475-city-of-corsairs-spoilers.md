Sneaking into the urls of the images in the spanish distributor of the game, I've found an image from the City of Corsairs [http://www.edgeent.com/home/check_public_gallery/edgmec53_es_1_abanico].

 

I think that this image has'nt been published yet, if I am wrong, please let me know.

 

It looks like we'll get a new spirit unique ally called Súlien, judging for the description of the expansion, in which they say that we will get new Gondor allies, I suppose she will be Gondor, and she has 3 WP!

You're a bit late with that one.

The worst kind of thread...

 

I mean, even if you do have a new image, just putting as the thread title "X pack spoilers" makes it sound like you have the whole spoiler, making it even more misleading than it already is. Why not "New card fan" or "New imges from X pack" instead of this title?

I must still agree that I was dissapointed when I opened this thread :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

My bad, sorry :S

 

I use to rely in Four is faramir as a viable source of spoilers and previews, and the image is'nt published yet there, so I supposed it was a new one.
