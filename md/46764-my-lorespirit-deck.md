I've been pretty pleased with this deck I've been playing.  It breezed through the first and second scenario.  The only downside on the second scenario is the starting threat of 30 means the Troll instantly engages.   I used Protector Of Lorien so that Berevor could survive defending against the troll, then next turn I played a Forest Snare.  A second Troll came along a few turns after, but luckily Gandalf was ready to deal him some damage. 

There's lots of options in this deck - healing, card draw, threat reduction, card effect cancels.  One downside is that the hugely useful Northern Tracker is expensive to play.  Hopefully later on they'll be a card to give Spirit to other characters (other than Aragorn).  I did consider Denethor over Berevor, but Henmarth Riversong can fill in for his excellent ability, and Berevor is an excellent all-rounder.  She's even more useful with Unexpected Courage on her.

I just beat Scneario 3 with this deck first try!  That's all three scenarios beaten first try with this deck!

Glorfindal was the imprisoned hero, which was probably the best result, as I still had Berevor for defence and Dunhere for the Spirit resource.  Unexpected Courage on Berevor early on was a god-send, enabling her either to both Defend and Attack, or if there were no Enemies, to use her ability.  Some turns I was using Berevor's ability twice, plus Gleowine to pull 5 cards.  In the end I had gone through my whole deck, with about 75-80% of all my cards in my hand to choose from.  I didn't bother Travelling as I knew my heavy card draw would get me through to a Northern Ranger soon enough - plus alot of the Locations in this scenario have detrimental travelling effects.

Berevor took the shadow key for the first Objective, with a Daughter Of Nimrodel on hand to top her up.  Glorfindal was soon rescued and the Nazgul defeated in one turn through the timely arrival of Gandalf.  I was making high progress on the Quest by now due to lots of allies, Protector of Lorien and now two Northern Rangers seeing off the Locations.  The last Quest card was breezed through in one turn.  No Orc Guards were played as i had exhausted my deck long ago!  In the end a pretty comfortable win - but I admit i got lucky on the imprisoned Hero - despite Glorfindal being kick-ass i think it more important to have Berevor's high Defence and access to Spirit from the start.

Yeap scenario 3 is all about luck.I have done scenario 3 with 3 different decks and i have tried all combinations of heroes and cards and the only thing that matters is luck.If you are lukcy and the prisoner is not the hero you need most and the 3  cards on the objectives are most of them treachery cards and low threat locations then you can smile and just enjoy the ride.

If the first 3 cards are high threat locations and monsters then just restart your game and hope that the next time you will have better luck.

I've now taken to having Denethor / Berevor / Dunhere.  I find the low starting threat of 26 preferable, especially in Scenario 2, it gives you enough time to build resources to take down the Hill Troll.  Also it favours Dunhere's ability.  The lower your starting threat, the more enemies will stay in the staging area for Dunhere to attack.

I've now used this deck against Scenario 3 and won three out of three times!  I even had Dunhere imprisoned on one of them, cutting off access to my Spirit cards, and still came out the other side.
