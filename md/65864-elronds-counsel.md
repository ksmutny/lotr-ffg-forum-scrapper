This is a bad thread, I see, I just wanted to point out the title of the card, unlike that of the chapter in the book, refers to a counsel as advice instead of a council as a board of people. I just see the title used wrong more frequently than used correctly. Not that it bothers me, of course, I am just trying to be informative.

Great card by the way. Both in terms of use and theme.

ah yes counsel and council……think that may be a source of confusion for those with english not as a native language

And the game itself can actually cause more problems with the likes of Born Aloft. Maybe one day they will make an adventure pack with all the misprinted cards for free. Ok, they won't.

I 'd say that, in our case, Elrond's Counsel is preferable to Elrond's Council, since:

1. It's an event.

2. Its effect signifies a piece of advice, thus a counsel.

we will probably see a council card too - something that allows you to draw allies from your deck for free

ELRONDS COUNCIL

Event

cost 5

Secrecy 3

exhaust a Noldor hero you control to search the top 10 cards of your deck. you may put into play 1 ally of (elf dwarf  hobbit and men  - dont know how to word it but you know what i mean)

 

probably hugely over powered ….but the themes there and thats all that counts (not :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )

Of course. People just probably have the Council too firmly rooted in their mind from reading the book.

Nothing in the Spirit sphere is over-powered, did you forget?

Seriously, an interesting idea. And we might indeed see the card, whether it'll do this or that.

Actually, when the whole "Born Aloft" vs. "Borne Aloft" conversation got started, I looked it up in my dictionary and found that whether with the "e" or without, it can still refer to bearing a burden rather than giving birth. I do think using the "e" helps to clarify things, but technically it isn't a typo.

## 11 [lleimmoen on June 12, 2012](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65864-elronds-counsel/?do=findComment&comment=643456)

I know. It used to be used without the "e" also; however, neither it is used like that now, nor Tolkien himself used it as such, so it really should have been Borne Aloft.

Elrond's Counsel is an event.

Elrond's Council is an ally.

Allies. Plural. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

That would be one hell of an ally card if they put them all together on one though!

Couple of elf lords, the white council, at least one istari. Judging by the cost and power levels of the recent cards it would probably be an instant win and cost 3-4 resource.

But at least it'd look really cool when Magali did the art. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]

3-4 cost for a insta-win?
It's Spirit Sphere for sure, then!
