 DESCRIPTION

Little after the heroes helped the Eagle Wilyador near Rhosgobel, Radagast the Brown welcomed them to his humble shack in order to rest and lay low for a while.
In one of his conversation with the Elf, Radagast mentioned another Wizard just like him and Gandalf: Rómestámo, that responsible to weaken the forces of the Evil One in the far East. The Brown Wizard even mentioned a good friend of the heroes: Glorfindel, the Noldor warrior; saying that he was allowed a second passage through Middle-Earth as a gift, and his second come coincided with that of Rómestámo.
While the dawn rose on the horizon, the Elf kept his conversation cherished with the Wizard, but nothing else could be said, because they had to go fulfill their mission: Capture the creature Gollum and take him to the Silvan elves east of the Misty Mountains.
