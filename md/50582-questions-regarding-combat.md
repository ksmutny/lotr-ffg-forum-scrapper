I only purchased the game last week and have been playing the mirkrood quest line to get to grips with rules and when I finaly won my 1st game I was earger to move on to the next quest line "Journey down the Auduin" and met my first hill troll.

My question is how do I kill it? it has a deffence of 3 and none of the heros have an attack of 4 or more Unless equiped with weapon attachments from a tactics deck.

Can I attack with two or more hero's/allys and combine their attack?

Â 

Thanks

Yes, if you exhaust more than one character to attack an Enemy, then you add up their Attack before reducing Defense. Gandalf can also help here.

Great, Thanks for the help =D

Does that also work for defence?

no, for defense you can only use 1 ally or hero, unless you play a card such as Stand and Fight which would allow multiple defenders.
