Hello,

 

I have a question regarding Enemy Attacks. I understand that if a character defends an attack, that character takes whatever applicable damage if they lose the attack. However, what if the player decides not to defend. Which characters take damage? Could someone give me a quick simple example of an undefended attack? Look forward to reading everyone's advice.

In an undefended attack, all the damage (the attack strength of the attacking enemy) must be placed on one hero (your choice). You can't choose an ally, and you can't split the damage up between heroes.

And welcome to the game! (Nice name for a Form VII practitioner).

 And the worse thing about 'undefend' is, the hero you choose to take damage will not absorb the attacking strength from its defend strength!  Let say the enemy, Dol Guldur Beastmaster, attacked with 3 attack strength and  you are in situation of "undefend'.  You choose Aragorn to take the damage.  So, at the end, Aragorn has to take 3 damage tokens instead of 1 damage token.  The defending strength of 2 from Aragon is not consider here, because you are undefending the attack.

 Thanks for the information. I looked again through the rule book and they didn't explain that. However, I'm not sure if there would ever be a situation where I would not defend. I suppose there are though. Thanks again!!

There are encounter cards with When Revealed effects that exhaust your characters, so it's entirely possible that you'll have to eat an undefended attack at some point or another.
