Just had an interesting situation come up and want to check with you all to see if you think I played it right.  In the travel phase, I traveled to Mountains of Mirkwood.  The card that came off the encounter deck was Dol Guldur Orcs.  I didn't give anyone any damage because "characters committed to a quest are considered committed to that quest through the end of the quest phase" and per the Dol Guldur card I would apply damage to someone "currently committed to a quest."  In the travel phase, no one would be currently committed to a quest.  Sound right?

you are correct- no damage is given as even though characters remain exhausted they are no longer commited to the quest after the phase ends
