I know some of you are still waiting for your Gollum sets to arrive, so if you're looking to pass the time until then I wrote a review of the set here if you're interested:

I heartily agree with all you said.  My local games store let me borrow their advanced preview set of 'Gollum', but have to give it back when the proper sets arrive.  The extra cards for each Sphere, although limited, are a start, and Bilbo gives a bit of Hero variety.  My comments in previous threads will make it obvious that I have avoided the temptation to buy another Core set.  Too much waste!  What can you do with duplicate Hero,  Encounter  and Scenario cards?  Yes, it is more difficult, but I enjoy the challenge.  This also gives me an opportunity to thank you for all the extra scenarios you have developed.  Havn't succeeded yet in all of them, but it helped to fill in the time after the unfortunate delays.  Keep up the good work - IF your wife lets you!  Cheers!

Your local games store sounds just awesome.

I have gone back and forth on getting an extra core set, and though I feel like I’m missing out a bit, I’m still not convinced that it’s not just a rip-off. By the time you’ve got a few expansions I doubt you’ll miss it, but there’s still that feeling of not having the complete game. Shame FFG went this route, but it’s business at the end of the day.

Glad you enjoyed my LOTR scenarios too – thanks for your comments mate. More on the way some day but I’m getting my money’s worth out of Hunt for Gollum first...

great review!

in terms of buying 2 core sets...FFG should release a "naked" core set that includes the all the additional cards to have a full set, 2 threat counters, and some extra damage/progress/resource tokens.  make it a reduced price.  basically everything minus the encounter/quest/hero cards.

## 5 [NinjaDorg on July 13, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49836-hunt-for-gollum-review/?do=findComment&comment=499310)

 Thanks mate.

And much as we'd all love a 'completion' kit, and given that there's a guaranteed market for it, it seems weird that FFG would categorically state that it will not happen.  But they did.  So you have to decide whether or not it's worth the cash for an extra few cards from another coreset and then chucking the rest...  No thanks - I'll get another Thunderstone expansion instead!

I was just thinking about this today. How there should be the "core set" and "players sets". If I want to play this game with my buddies a whole extra core set seems expensive and wasteful. There should be a "player set" that includes threat trackers, heroes, and player cards.

 Maybe once there are a few big box expansions out, and initial core set sales are dropping off they might release it.  But I wouldn't hold your breath!

I know there is a list somewhere, but are there a lot of good cards missing from the core set ie. not 3 included?  from what i remember there arent that many cards that have 3 copies in the core set.

Ninjadorg,

Read your review, Thank you for not spoiling the quests btw!, but there may be a typo? You mention a Spirit/Leader deck with Eowyn, Aragorn, and Thalin. Is that supposed to be Theodred or did you truly take a tri-sphere to battle?

I'm glad I'm hearing positive feedback on Bilbo. I've been afraid he's way overcosted and too fragile to include. But so far, everyone that's actually played with him says he's a winner.

Bilbo is ok in my opinion(before i thought he is bad).

I build up one deck based on Bilbo and HFG cards. (I dont have real cards so i use proxy).

His ability draw 1 more card per turn amazing.He also can defend in some case he is defense 2 not so bad. My idea Bilbo, Beravur and Denetor. I have song of the kings and Ministrels + sneak attack and strider path +steward of gondor and celebrian stone. + Lot of leadership allies. Working quite well. I draw all my deck in my hand in the first  10 turns. Threat ca go up to 40-45. After you have lot of allies in play,  Most powerfull enemies engage and snared already and 3 gandalf with 3 sneak attack in hand.

Than you start to movie and quest like crazy by discarding card through protector of Lorien and play Gandalf every turn for reduce threat and help to kill enemies. This not a top deck but very interesting to play.

Thanks for pointing that out - it was definitely a typo!  It must have been a short, bearded version of Theodred I was using - can't believe no one picked up on that earlier.  In any case I updated the review now, cheers.

 

After seeing the preview of Bilbo I honestly thought I'd leave himin the box after a quick experimental play.  But now I see that depending on how you play/design your deck he can be incredibly valuable, moreso with fewer players - and solo he is just awesome because you're drawing 100% more cards every turn.

£30 for 51 new cards just doesn't cut it for me, much as I'd like to have those extra options FFG have simply messed themselves here.

## 15 [Glaurung on July 18, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49836-hunt-for-gollum-review/?do=findComment&comment=500948)

I get it in my hands yesterday. I play 5 games.

First game play 3 players with 3 mono decks. Really cool and hard game and we lose. Second game we play again 3 players but wit expert decks 50 cards, win very easy. Next game we play again with 3 players (3 expert deck) but reveal 4 encounter cards instead 3, also win very easy.

Than i play 1 game solo expert 50 cards deck, long and hard game and i lose in the end(was really interesting). Next game again solo , same deck , very long and hard game and i win(also very interesting game).

Verdict: The quest is interesting and game expirience is really different from 3 core sets.Scaling also better more players you have more dangerous encounter cards effects which is good but still game is to easy if you have expert 50 cards decks.

Really there is same problems as with core set quests. To easy wtih 3 and more players and for expert decks. So i still wonder wnen we will get the quest which one will be manage to play against expert decks and more than 1 player????

For good game expirience play solo. In coop game play with mono decks than is ok. Otherwise is walk in the park.

 P.S. Art is very good like always.

 With all this talk of easy expert decks you're actually making me feel better about only having one core set - so cheers!

Actually you right. For now really not necessary to build up 50 cards (3copies cards) expert decks. If you build up this decks the game is to easy.

The best is play mono sphere decks for coop. In solo yes with good expert deck you win from 80% to 90% of game sessions.

The HFG difiicult level is 4. So according to this logic 5 and 6 difficult level will be ok for expert 50 cards decks and 8,9,10 (maybe up?)

is ok for coop game expert decks. Something like this maybe???

Well, I got my copy of HfG today and was surprised how easy it was. After failed many, many times on "Down the Anduin" I had streamlined and fine tuned my solo decks so I could beat Anduin it at the end (Spirit/Leadership and Lore/Tactic, with two core sets). With each of these two decks I easily beat HfG on the first attempt. If you keep your threat below 35 and dont draw a "Hunter from Mordor" as a shadow card this scenario isnt really a challenge.  I wouldn't even rate it being difficulty level 4 - feels more like 3 or 2 (??).

Every time you play, it can be totally different depending on the cards you draw, so don't judge it on only a few plays. Also, people have been saying that this scenario is great because it's actully harder with more people, unlike most of the core scenarios which are way harder solo. Try it with some friends!

Yes is quite easy..... Yes with more player is more difficult but still...... If you already play 3 quests form core set and waiting for something new HFG give you no much fun anyway. To easy!!! 

I dont now what to say. I think if Conflict in Carrock will not provide more challenge i drop to play this game. Or maybe wait until tournament system and than decide...... I notice that already in another topic: You wait for HFG so long  time, get it, play and get disapointed since is to easy. And now you must to wait again another month for next adv pack. You sure you have enough patience??? Yes maybe Conflict in C. we still will wait but if this one not give enough challenge i think the game start to lose loyal players......

 Glaurung, maybe I'm just in an irritable mood...but I am sure tired of seeing you say the game is "sooooo easy".

Why do you feel the need to come to boards, about once a day it seems!, to say how easy you find the game?

Based on other commenters, there are many, many players still struggling to to complete the quests, even after months of trying and deck tweaks.

Anyone who claims the game is so easy, or has -100 threat points (as another poster mentioned), makes me think they must be playing the game incorrectly.

But, who knows? Maybe I'm playing incorrectly which is why I don't find the game "too easy".

Either way, I can understand why you'd be frustrated in a game that you were looking forward too, if it's too easy (I've felt that way about many video games), but I don't get boasting about it often on the message boards.

Just my two cents...

I don't think you'll find the challenge you're looking for in Conflict at the Carrock.  Most likely the challenging quests you want to play will be in The Dead Marshes and Return to Mirkwood.  That is assuming the difficulty of the quests increases with each release.

I can hardly wait to get my copy of HfG.  My game store gets it in tomorrow.  It will be really fun to play with the new player cards and experience the new quest.

## 23 [NinjaDorg on July 21, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49836-hunt-for-gollum-review/?do=findComment&comment=502609)

I definitely don't agree with Glaurung that the game is a piece of piss, but Hunt for Gollum does at least seem easier than say, River Anduin.  Although maybe it's harder with more players - only tried with 1 or 2 so far.

As for repeatedly beating Dol Guldur and finding it too easy?  I'm slightly dubious of that.  I also think a single small expansion including a scenario that was more difficult than Dol Guldur would be met with significant frustration from fans.  I expect the next 'very difficult' quest will appear in the next big box expansion, so that they can include a couple of easier scenarios to offset it...

Yes Dain you right i talk to much about it. So dont worry soon i will not be here anymore.

Just maybe i wait from this game to much.....When game come out i was so exiting about..... Same before like in Decipher lotr tcg time....

Maybe before i use to play this card game as a sport and challenge (tournaments ans so on) but this game is just fun home game not manage for this.

When i use t play lotr decpher before to win against good players is always was not easy and session was long , hard and until the end of the game you never know what your opponent can do and game can brake in every turn.  FFG lotr lcg amazing idea. But quest manage to be very weak!!! There is so many ways how to make quest more interesting but looks like FFG want to make this game casual style.

I also try to create Lotr community in my town and last week i manage to make a HFG event in our club. So many players which i try to bring  to games notice same problem (game easy and boring to quick) so most of them stay with GOT and other games.

This game touch my soul cose is Tolkien and i love it.This why for me is hard decision to stop play this game............  And i wonder what kind of challenge you find with third quest on coop game??? And HFG we play and reveal even 4 cards in 3 player game and win easy.

I can certainly understand your frustration, I just think it's pointless to say it in nearly every post you make.

I don't play any other Living Card Games, so forgive my ignorance, but I wonder how fair it is to judge a game with only 50ish different player cards? Hunt for Gollum only added 9 new cards, correct? And there are 40-something (51?) in the Core Set?

Decipher's LOTR game was a traditional CCG and had 100-200 cards right out of the gate. It's comparing apples and oranges, in my opinion.

I think a better assesment can be made after the first full cycle of adventure packs and maybe even after the next large set (is there any info on if/when these will actually happen?).

Of course, that is also the risk with a LCG, as I see it. You release a product without much variation in the cards and people are going to be left feeling unfullfilled.

How have the other FFG LCGs felt upon their first release?

I start play Decipher tcg from the first set there is also was very small card pool. My complains never was against the small card pool. And not against the game mechanic is briliant. Small card pool is not a problem my friend. Card pool will grow up with adv pack so is only matter of time. This third lotr card game for me for last 12 years.I use to play Middle earth ccg(really coo game) decipher lotr and now this FFG one.I passed with 2 previous game all circle, start , grow up and End(middle earth i play not much as decipher).So i have expirience about the cards game and i know what im talking about.

My problem with this game is : balance is very bad, scaling is awfull( HFG little bit change it), very stupid on my view victory points system(they take this idea from middle earth ccg but there is much more interesting) and  low difficult level.

Balance can be fixx with erratas, rules adding, add adv pack , Scaling same way. But quests  as i sad before manage to be weak for now. I can accept it in core set cose is beginning. But HFG this is first Adv pack. Is show us the way which the game will grow.

So what is the main thing for this game????

Quests and encounter cards. The quest is heart of the game. Very important. They should be done very interesting and hard. But now all of them done 50% power. Hope it will change. HFG is  good but not good enough. Will see Next one.

 have you read this article?

http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1981 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1981]

at least it sounds like they are going for different "flavors" for each adventure pack quest. some focus on exploring, some on brute force, some on location travel, etc. i am intrigued with how they plan on having different sorts of quests.

i'm also looking forward to massing at osgiliath because, you are correct: the quests are super important and are the heart of the game!

i also played MECCG and Decipher's game, and i liked them both, but i am still more excited about this one...and willing to be a bit more patient! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Yes i know this article. A agree wit everything there. But there is the idea of design of the quests.Nothing to do with hard level.

If you play middle earth and Decipher game you understand what i talking about anyway. I wonna to see quests level like: we are 2 players and  even  when we play 2 50 cards expert decks(3 copies each card) and in the middle of the game when we have lot of attachments on our heroes and lot of allies in support we still scare to lose cose with  quest porgress and with power of encounter cards we know there is lot of danger and game can brake easy and mistake is deadly. 

For now when you play coop and you on the middle of the game ,have couple allies and attachments 90% you win the game and is only matter of time and victory points. Card like norhtern tracker for example destroy all meaning of locations idea. So ok instead make errata make encounter cards more powerful in next adv pack. HFG this a joke!!!! Not a challenge at all. We need something more serious, much more serious!!!

Thanks for chat with me dude. You give me a hope. There is always a hope as Gandalf sad

Glaurung, one popular variant I've seen people using who find the current Quests too easy, is to draw 1 MORE Encounter card every quest phase than you normally would. At least for now, until some harder Quests are released, this sounded like a pretty easy way to adjust difficulty.

My group, however, has not found these Quests to be too easy yet, as we're just starting out. We haven't even beat the Dol Guldur Quest in 3 player yet. sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]

But yeah, if we ever *do* get to a point where all Quests become pretty easy, we'll probably just do this fix, or try only using 2 Heroes each, since the rulebook says you can play with 1-3 Heroes each.

Hope that helps for now. I'm sure there'll be a good mix of Quests in the near future. On top of the Adventure Pack one that are coming, there's also that Gencon Quest they announced that will be available through print on demand. There's also NinjaDorg's cool homeade ones to try out.

at least it sounds like they are going for different "flavors" for each adventure pack quest. some focus on exploring, some on brute force, some on location travel, etc. i am intrigued with how they plan on having different sorts of quests.

i'm also looking forward to massing at osgiliath because, you are correct: the quests are super important and are the heart of the game!

i also played MECCG and Decipher's game, and i liked them both, but i am still more excited about this one...and willing to be a bit more patient! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

 

 

Yes i know this article. A agree wit everything there. But there is the idea of design of the quests.Nothing to do with hard level.

If you play middle earth and Decipher game you understand what i talking about anyway. I wonna to see quests level like: we are 2 players and  even  when we play 2 50 cards expert decks(3 copies each card) and in the middle of the game when we have lot of attachments on our heroes and lot of allies in support we still scare to lose cose with  quest porgress and with power of encounter cards we know there is lot of danger and game can brake easy and mistake is deadly. 

For now when you play coop and you on the middle of the game ,have couple allies and attachments 90% you win the game and is only matter of time and victory points. Card like norhtern tracker for example destroy all meaning of locations idea. So ok instead make errata make encounter cards more powerful in next adv pack. HFG this a joke!!!! Not a challenge at all. We need something more serious, much more serious!!!

Thanks for chat with me dude. You give me a hope. There is always a hope as Gandalf sad



Glaurung, I think your best chance to really enjoy the game would be to switch to a competitive variant.  Have someone play the shadow.  Give them a fixed hand size (say, number of opponents +3 you could tweak the numbers).  Let them refill their hand at the end of each phase (or, even as they play, if you want a stronger shadow player).  After players make their choice to engage, let the shadow chose which player to engage (assuming they have a suitably high threat).  If you want more power to the shadow, let them make more of the choices the player;s normally make.  Let them assign damage from the dol goldur scout's, for instance.  It's not perfect, but I think you would find it a variant more to your liking, and certainly more challenging.

And this we also try already. Shadow player is to powerful. Difficult to find balance.

Anyway friends thanks for all answer to me.

I really hope maybe one day we can meet on the world cup Lotr lcg. Why not a??????

Glaurung, I'm getting the feeling that you are always going to find the game too easy.

The reason? Simple: The game is made for 1 core set, two-player, mono-sphere.

If you deviate from that the difficulty level gets messed up.

You're playing 3 core sets, 4-player, multi-sphere.

Unless you adopt house rules you are never going to find the game a challenge.

IMO you have two choices:

a) spend time with your mates figuring out the best house rules to introduce a challenge.

b) play a different game.

Do you have any evidence to support these claims? They all seem inaccurate to me, but the one about the game being mono-sphere is particularly ridiculous.

hes probably just basing it off the box saying 1-2 players and the fact that you get 4 mono spehere decks in the core set.

## 36 [Bohemond2 on July 22, 2011](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49836-hunt-for-gollum-review/?do=findComment&comment=502894)

Right, but we have cards that are specifically designed to enable dual sphere play.

I little bit thinking about future adventures packs...........

Frodo next hero in next Adv pack. He ability to convert damage to threat is amazing.

Can you image: staring hero Frodo, Theodred, Eleanor.  starting thread 7+8+7= 22

So frodo spirit there is  Northern tracker, Greatings, test of will, Hasty stroke, U. courage.

Theodred leadership :sneak attack, Steward of Gondor, Faramir  and so on.

With all this threat reducing , counter ability, (by Eleanor and other spirit events) resources boost this deck can be very very powerful.

Yes you need some strong attacker. Maybe some alies???

SO player decks power grow up more and more. Difficult level of the quest should be increase as well. Maybe C. in Carrock will be 4 or 5 difficult level???

I hope so........

I was talking difficulty wise. Not in the literal sense. Of couse the game has sphere synergies. That's not the point.

In other words, just to be totally clear for all the literalists out there:

The game's difficulty ratings are geared toward two people sitting down with one core set, picking a sphere and playing.

As soon as you give yourself advantages beyond that like multiple cores, 3+ players, and multi-sphere super decks the game's difficulty ratings can be thrown out the window.

With so many different factors involved (amount of players, number of spheres in deck and different amount of owned core sets/expansions) the difficulty level will stay fluid. I wonder why FFG has introduced a difficulty rating of 1-10 which will make casual gamers believe that the difficulty levels of the various quests are somewhat locked and technically predetermined. A system like "Easy, Normal, Difficult" or "Normal for 2-Players, Difficult for solo play" would have suited much better imho.

Yes you right. And  1 more thing about difficult level. Anduin is difficult 4. Hunt for Gollum also is difficult 4. But i suppose the Anduin quest is more hard.

The last stage on the Gollum quest is very easy if you compare with ambush on the last stage of Anduin. HFG much easy!!!

In HFG quest you must follow the golden rule: If you can travel than travel. Never keep more than 1 location on the staging area if possible.

Keep this rule and you will win mostly.

Anduin much more harder with troll on the first stage and long boat trip on the second. And last stage ambush also can be very tricky.

But FFG ranking both of them same.  Strange!!!

That's the mindset I have when I start playing solo and then I lose the Anduin quest over and over and I'm thinking, "This is only a FOUR?" Or I try to imagine what an 8-10 must be like, if Prisoner is only a 7.

 Be very interesting to see what rank the next quest gets, that's for sure.  Between 4 and 6 would suit me, although it would probably kill the game for Glaurung!

Actually i already dont care. I understand already this game is not same level like Middle earth ccg or Decipher tcg. I really doubt the game as a sport will ever come to serious level. So i relax already. Just have fun sometimes play home once a week or something..........

And  more and more players get same feelings. Many people start to complain about easy level and boring quests. Will be more and more.

I dont thing the game will have big future but as i already say i dont care anymore.

Unless you're only playing with 4 players all the time, I think you must be missing some minor rule to consider Escape easy. I've gotten to the point where I can beat Anduin fairly regularly with 2 players but Esape is still impossible. With 4 or even 3 players the loss of 1 hero is relatively insgnificant, but huge when playing solo or with 2 people.

To the contrary I think if the 'pro' competitive players feel the game is too easy, it will be a grand success - for more casually-minded players which outnumber the former by at least an order of magnitude.
