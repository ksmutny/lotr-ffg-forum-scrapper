Heya, recently I've played through the Hobbit 1st saga and scenario and I don't really get how those two treasures work alone or in combination with Sting. Card links here:

Few questions:

 

1) Does the character need to attack alone and destroy enemy to trigger Glamdring or Orkist? Legolas wording was diffrent and it was about participating in an attack that destroys the enemy, here the character needs to destroy the enemy alone, am i right?

 

2) How does Glamdring works with Sting on Bilbo Baggins? If I exhaust Bilbo to defend, use Sting ability and kill the enemy, does the Glamdring triggers too?

 

Thanks in advance,

Zura

1) No, the attached character just needs to be participating.

2) Glamdring wouldn't trigger because Bilbo's not destroying an enemy- Sting's effect is.

Thank you a lot. One more question - does Dain Ironfoot passive effect works when he's sacked? I suppose yes, as he does not have to activate it, but i would like to clarify it too.

Yes, Dain works if he gets Sacked while ready. If he's exhausted when he gets Sacked, he's dead weight.

Dain's ability will still work, as long as he is ready, of course.
