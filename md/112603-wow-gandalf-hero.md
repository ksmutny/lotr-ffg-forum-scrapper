Not seeing like any downsides to him either other than his threat is high and no Gandalfs in player decks then. But who cares! He's a beast! Staff is Ridiculously good too, and even the event!

I like him, only being able to play neutral cards with him (or the card on top of your deck) will be quite a burden though.

I think the new Gandalf hero is cool, but I was really hoping he wouldn't show up. I'm glad his threat is so high so people might be deterred from playing him because I don't want to be required to give up my Gandalf allies. At least we're at a point where Gandalf allies aren't required to be in decks. Rapier makes a good point about him being neutral, but some songs can change that pretty easily.

 

I think the things that I'm most excited about are the other spoiled cards. Gandalf's Staff will work with any Gandalf card, though the hero and the Hobbit Gandalf are obviously the better targets. Gandalf's Staff gives even more reason to keep OHaUH Gandalf in play. 4 willpower plus 4 attack or 4 defense is good enough each round, but now we can also draw cards, get resources, and get rid of shadow cards. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

 

Flame of Anor works for all Istari characters, so that means you can pop that card into eagle decks with Radagast, and make him more useful too!

I don't think it will be too big of a problem. His Staff, Steward, Zigil Miners (so great with Gandalf!!) can pour extra resources on your other Heroes, and Errand Riders/Blue Mountain Traders will make use of Gandalf's excess ones. Plus Stargazers, etc. can maximize the top deck card plays. Word of Command 3x helps find this stuff plus provides a deck shuffle for Gandalf.

Oh man, the thought of running a Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel deck...  I hope they make Narya so we can have all three elven rings.

## 14 [Tracker1 on August 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1185886)

Cool thing about him is that you can build a deck with cards from any sphere, as long the cards from the spheres not represented by the other heroes are 1 cost, so Gandalf can be sure to play them when they show up.

For instance, you could have a Gandalf - Glorfindel secrecy deck,,and throw in some Rivendell Blades and Vassal of the Windlords and play them when they show up on top of the deck no problem. Through in some Protector of Lorien to discard any cards that can't be played if they get in your hand.

There are going to be so many possibilities like this.

Seems like he will be worth every point of threat he has.

Super excited, he's going to be a game changer for me.

Also, article say TRD is in the way to retailers, but it is still listed as on the boat. It would be awesome to get before or around the same time as GenCon so we can all share in the excitement.

Well, if blue mountain trader didn't get an errata, playing with Gandalf might change that :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

And when will they finally get rid of the card draw craziness in this game? Why is there no hand size limit? Just keeps getting more and more out of hand

Why everyone are trying to pair Gandalf with such major threat bearers? Am I the only one who can see him being a good match with extremely low threat pals, the hobbits?

## 21 [Narsil0420 on August 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1186008)

So mind-blowing!

 

I don't think he's over powered at all, having him be neutral and not able to pay for sphere cards in your hand means that you have to really put some thought into how to best use him. Great design! Like other thoughtfully designed cards, it makes you go back and reexamine previous cards and makes old cards useful again.

 

I like him with Lore. You've got ability to fetch songs which would help him out, Word of Command, and Gildor would be very helpful to get something back on top of your deck.

 

Are there other cards that let you put a card from your hand into or on top of your deck?

If you think just these cards are overpowered, wait till you see the other Gandalf attachment we're getting in the box ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Also, I absolutely love the art on all the cards, especially Gandalf. I was dreading that we would get yet another Magali artwork (not that she's bad, but she's not very good at drawing bearded men, and I dislike the pose in Hobbit Gandalf), but instead we got this magnificent piece that reminds me of the Ralph Bakshi poster of his LOTR movies.

The basic game mechanics of LOTR are pretty stiff ( clever, solid, thematic but stiff ) you don't draw 2 cards per turn and you can't spend clicks to draw cards, so they are giving us many different ways to work around this. I can't really see any bad in this and i can't really disagree with your whole statement more.

The problem is that there are ways to draw so many cards that its gets silly. Ive seen guys with 20 cards in there hand at one time. This simply compounds the problem.

 

I am not sure if you listen to the podcasts (ie - Grey Company, not so much COTR) but they often talk about this. One guy (I think Dan) mentioned how the Elrond deck is basically over once you get three rounds in and set it up. Imagine throwing this in with Vilya, you don't even need the **** Stargazer anymore. Its just stupidly powerful. They also go over how a hand size limit is needed.

 

If you made a good outlands deck and then added in Gandalf and Hirluin are you telling me that you wouldn't crush things? He can also now pay for those allies on top and just imagine the sheer power of drawing an additional card each turn with his staff.

 

I want quests - better quests that are fun and challenging. That is how you keep this game going. Not giving us insanely powerful cards.

Gandalf can never play anything but neutral cards from your hand (unless he has a song attached). he only gains the spheres when playing the top card of your deck; "when playing cards this way" = from the top of your deck - never your hand.

The card also says that it has the "printed resource icon". Does that mean that I can play, say, Trained for War if I have it on top of my deck and I also have a Tactics hero (or no other hero)?

So, playing a tactic cards which is on top of my deck, gives him the tactics resource icon for the rest of the round, correct?

 

Thats what was my first impression but wanted to be sure.

 

He is broken  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]

I was also thinking of combining Gandalf with the hobbit heroes. It think it would be fun to play and pretty thematic also.

 

EDIT:

@7theye you are really not forced to play him. When I make decks I try to make it harder for me so I do not always include auto-include cards, let's say A Test of Will, UC,... It keeps the game challenging enough to not get bored of it. Not that I could get anyway. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

no. nothing on the card says he gains a resource icon for the phase or the round. only when playing the top card of the deck, does he gain the resource icon of that card.

 

as soon as you've played the card with one of gandalf's resources, he loses the sphere icon.

That brings me to another rules question that I'm sure has come up before.  For attachments with requirements (like Silvan, Rohan, Tactics, etc.) does it get discarded if the attached character loses that trait?  Could you use Gandalf to play Spear of the Citadel on him (requires tactics) and then next turn play Burning Brand (requires lore)?  They would have to be played from the top of the deck, but that could still be pretty strong.

He can also now be used in a mono-deck. Imagine him and Spirit Glorfindel and Frodo. They would basically kill any scenario now, and on top of that you can splash whatever you want and also use his ability to play mono-sphere cards.

 

He is broken just like Elrond and vilya can be and Outlands are. If you cant see how using him would mean victory over most scenarios then I don't think you have realized how powerful he is yet.

even if you lose the trait the attachment stays, you only need to have the trait when playing it , a nice trick was to use Narvis Belt on Dain for Lore and play Burning brand, then you were not losing the card.

yes perhaps I am over-reacting. There is nightmare which is best suited to my play side and not just crushing things. Thanks Glaurung for bringing me back to earth lol.

 

The inability to use sneak attack with him also helps in terms of minimizing his power. He does open up tons of new deck types though and is a game changer, which perhaps he should be.

If it weren't for the fact that Gandalf can't be used to pay for cards in your hand (unless they're neutral), I'd feel like he was overpowered, but since he only has spheres when he is playing cards off the top of the deck, his neutrality is neutralized... that neutral nonsense wasn't on purpose...

 

Anyway, I find card draw to be very give and take with Gandalf. The more cards you have in your hand, the less he can contribute to paying for cards. On the other hand, resource generation = card draw for him in a way. The more resources we have (especially on Gandalf because he can pay for any of them), the more cards we can pull off the deck and play. Cards that shuffle the deck or rearrange the top cards of the deck become a tool for determining what cards are in your hand, versus which cards you'll draw next.

 

*Interesting and useless infinite loop:
Miruvor on top of the deck can be played for 1 resource, then can be used to grant a resource and be put on top of the deck... repeat. This could be also be used as a means of transferring Spirit resources to other heroes, which is cool, but the not the biggest deal. It does mean, though, that you could attach the resource generation cards all to one spirit hero and be able to spread the resources however you want, simply by having a Miruvor, so a Steward of Gondor + Resourceful on a Spirit hero could be pretty powerful.

 

*Also Interesting

Gandalf's Search matches with Gandalf by name and also synergizes pretty well. Sadly this card costs too much to really be useful.

> Miruvor on top of the deck can be played for 1 resource, then can be used to grant a resource and be put on top of the deck... repeat. This could be also be used as a means of transferring Spirit resources to other heroes, which is cool, but the not the biggest deal. It does mean, though, that you could attach the resource generation cards all to one spirit hero and be able to spread the resources however you want, simply by having a Miruvor, so a Steward of Gondor + Resourceful on a Spirit hero could be pretty powerful.

 

I thought about this, but Gandalf's text says "once per phase" and "play ... as if it were in your hand", so you could only play Miruvor once in the planning phase.

I started looking at all the cards that i've said, "if I could only find an easy way to have access to this in another sphere".

Many are 0 cost events. Dareons Runes can no pretty much be an auto include in every Gandalf deck regardless of sphere. Deep Knowledge for sphere's that don't have easy card draw. You could play A Very Good Tale in a tactics deck.

The options are pretty mind boggling, when I start to look at the cards, it will be hard to figure what to keep.

The biggest choice will start with choosing heroes to balance his high threat, but the skies the limit after that.

I don't want to say it, but putting him in an Outlands build could be pretty ridiculous.

This is amazing. Absolutely amazing. At first I thought him being neutral meant he could pay for cards from any sphere by default, and I thought "wow, that's crazy". Only being able to pay for sphere-cards at the top of the deck is probably a wise move. It's also thematic - he's one step ahead.

I don't know if my friends will want to part with their Gandalf allies, though.

## 50 [Tracker1 on August 6, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1186272)

I think the thing with Gandalf that's going to balance him out is that it could become easy to clog your hand with cards you cannot play. Right now I feel like a kid in a candy store, but I can only play 1 card per phase so yeah it's great to have test of will on top of my deck, but if a treachery card does not show up and I have no spirit hero, that card is coming to my hand next round and I'm stuck with it unless I have a way to discard it.

Another example, i use Gandalf ability to play top card of my deck in planning, and then shows up an important ally that can only be paid with Gandalf's resources. Stuck again.

Sure there are going to ways to plan around this, Stargazer, Gildor, etc. but without that help, trying to splash a lot of other spheres not represented by the heroes can be a risky game to play, and I'm sure getting stuck with cards that cannot be played and missing opportunities to play cards will happen every so often or even regularly.

Another way around it is not to splash off sphere cards.

Ways to discard cards from ones hand combined with a test of will may give a 2nd shot at playing cards that missed their mark first time around. Of course multiple copies can also help.

Anyway, I think he is going to offer lot's of new deck opportunities, but right now I'm leaning towards him not being as overpowered as my first take was. Heroes like this often bring a difficulty to work around and my sense is he'll be powerful but not so much that every quest is an instant success.

Really, the most joy I think anyone can have playing the new Gandalf (other than to set their teammates' teeth grinding) is to find the most ingenious and reliable way to make a deck work beautifully that honestly has no right to be working at all under normal circimstances (normal circumstances = pre-Gandalf).

Yeah what do you mean by useless cards? Let's say Gandalf has a bunch of resources, uses his ability to pay for a Spirit card and now he has the Spirit resource icon so can't he pay for other Spirit cards in your hand? OR does he only temporarily gain the Spirit icon to pay for that one card on top your deck?

## 61 [Teamjimby on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1186513)

It only works for the card on top of your deck.  Once you draw a card, you can't use Gandalf to pay for the card unless he has songs.

Ok yeah for sure, after reading the card a few more times he clearly only temporarily gains a certain resource to play for that top card.

This will definitely limit him and is the one thing keeping him from being over-powered

I was brainstorming about how they could do Gandalf the White.  I think it would have to be an attachment along the lines of "Play if Gandalf is in the discard pile.  Put Gandalf into play with this card attached.  Gandalf gets +1 Will/Attack/Defense."

It would probably have to cost 6+, but you could also potentially use it on an ally version of Gandalf.  Maybe instead of the stat bonus, it could be that he gains all spheres.  Somehow he would need to be more powerful than Gandalf the Grey.

## 70 [Glowwyrm on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1186698)

I am a big fan of heroes that allow you to explore totally new deck archetypes.  I think Gandalf is gonna be great as a secrecy hero, or paired with other low threat heroes, I think he'll really shine in aggro builds for the Voice of Isengard and the Ring-maker cycle.  Aggro builds work well for these scenarios, and popping another couple of high threat heroes alongside Gandalf and going in guns blazing sounds like an effective and fun way to tackle the scenarios.  If we get his ring in the Road Darkens, It would be a blast running an elf ring deck with Elrond, Galardiel and Gandalf.  Sure, your starting threat is crazy high, but you've got a ton of defense, hit points and willpower to take the early onslaught, and Galadriel (plus some spirit cards) can help keep you from threating out.  Really looking forward to these new player cards, can't wait to get my hands on them!

This may be the most powerful hero the game has ever released. Dump Gandalf + Elrond + Glorfindel into a deck and let the bodies hit the floor. 

## 72 [Tracker1 on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1186720)

Just ran a deck with Gandalf, Bifur, and Glorfindel Spirit on NM Into the Pit. Crushed it twice.

Gandalf is crazy good. Card draw is really phenomenal with him. It is possible to play a few cards a round with his ability too. Gildor will be a very good card with him to put cards back into the deck. Word of command really working now.

A few questions came up:

1. During setup after drawing 6 cards will the top card of your deck be visible? This can give a player an extra advantage about whether to mulligan or not.

2. If expert treasure hunter is attached to all 3 questing heroes, will the 2nd two cards be face up when making call? If so it's a guaranteed 3 cards.

3. Gandalf can give himself a resource with his staff, right? The staff is very strong is incredible for resource generation.

4. Can a card be played from the top of the deck even if Gandalf does not contribute any resources? So, another hero can pay for a 2 cost card even if Gandalf has no resources in his pool I assume.

Overall resource generation and card draw are really covered well with him, not to mention incredible stats. With a couple Unexpected courages, he's participating in each phase.

Playing with the top card of my deck face up changes so many things about the game, it's a bit mind boggling.

Haha he finally got spoiled hey. That artwork is crazy good!!! Makes me sad considering I don't really plan on using him. As awesome as he is I rely heavily on the core set Gandalf ally and I don't know how I'd stop using it. I am however racking my brain as to who I would replace of my 6 heroes (two handed) if I had to make room for Gandalf and certain ideas are becoming very tempting!

 

Wow tracker you are onto something, even if he doesn't have any resources or if he only has 1 or 2 and the card on top of your deck costs more than that I don't see anything stopping you from using your other heroes resources to play that card!
 

Also, surprised no-one has really said much other than simply mentioning songs but if you have one sphere it would really help if Gandalf had; just run x3 of that song and you're bound to get it eventually in most games and slap it on him thereby nullifying his neutral setback allowing him to play cards of that sphere from your hand, cards from any sphere from the top of your deck and his ridiculous stats and attachments. I kind of feel he shouldn't be able to have songs as it nullifies his only drawback (except for his high starting threat).

 

Also as amazing as that art is and as much as I love it I'd definitely prefer it without that weird blue scarf he is wearing... makes him look less powerful and awe-inspiring and more like doctor who or some ****.... lol

1. Yes.*

2. No.

3. Yes.

4. Yes.**

*this one is subtle because it probably depends on whether a character's abilities apply before the game has started. Obviously, if they don't then no.

**when I first read that I was sure you had missed something on the text of the card, but you didn't. It's crazy.

Could he be run single hero?

## 75 [entMoot on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1186753)

@Tracker1:

 

1. During set up you place your heroes and set your threat before shuffling your deck/drawing cards, so it seems that he does reveal your top card even when you are making mulligan decisions. Page 10 of the rule book outlines this ordering.

 

2. Not sure on the timing.

 

3. Yes. It doesn't say "another hero" or "another player."

 

4. His ability says that you may play the card. It doesn't stipulate that Gandalf has to spend resources, just that he is considered to have all printed icons when doing so.

## 76 [Tracker1 on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1186769)

Gandalf's staff is incredibly good. At first I was thinking he would only be able to contribute 1 resource to the top card of your deck, but with the staff giving him a resource he can play for any 2 resource card, so if you want Steward of Gondor in a deck without leadership and songs he could get it. Even in the first round if the Staff was payed for by 2 other heroes, he could then use the staff to get a resource and get SoG if it was on top of the deck.

Crazy stuff I say!

@Bullroarer, why you say no to Expert Treasure? Once a card is removed from the deck the next card should immediately become face up. It's a passive effect that should take place before the response.

From what I experienced so far there are going to be some timing issues like this while playing Gandalf.

Single hero will be a worthy challenge. Getting him with Treebeard + ents and Radagast with some eagles might be pretty interesting. Since, they are neutral allies that can provide some resources.

he only has the sphere whilst play the one card so his resources can only be used exclusively for his ability or neutral cards.

Tracker - the reason I said no is that I was thinking that there was only one window, but that clearly can't be right since ignoring Gandalf you could have three ETHs out and still activate them all. So I've changed my mind there.

And regarding #1, the game has started when you draw your opening hand so now I believe it should be an unqualified yes.

I feel that the player cards have seen too much power creep. The player cards have gotten so strong that even many Nightmare Mode Decks just don't feel very "NIghtmare-ish."

 

My group crushed all three Khazad Dum nightmare decks in one sitting, having to play Into the Pit twice, due to some really unlucky encounter deck reveals, but beating The Seventh Level and Flight from Moria the first time we had ever played them. And, none of us had looked at the encounter decks ahead of time. We just brought decks that we knew were good, and crushed all three scenarios. 

 

They were really fun, but I didn't think that they were difficult enough.

Yeah,Gandalf's ability is a passive, so the next top card should always be turned face up as soon as the old one is played or removed. This should take place before any forced or response triggers.

Playing him with Imladris Stargazer would be nice too. You will be able to determine your next five cards, and even the phase they are going to appear, so a full scale strategy. This could help players not to get i.e. ally cards when on other phases than planning.

His staff seems very strong card and if there is also a shadowfax attachment that has an ability that helps paying for cards of other sphaires (as i come to understand from some posts) it would be an auto include, but with other heroes being of low threat.

So if you fill your deck with 0 cost cards you could play one every phase.. or get his staff and easily play 2 one cost cards each round.. not that 0 or 1 cost cards are that great but it seems crazy to be able to just play 7 zero costs events each round.

But the fact remains that there can never now be a saga hero version of Boromir. Here's hoping for an ally though.

Not that. 6 different, unique ringbeares, one from each box. Giving you choices when playing saga quests, allowing you to approach differently previous saga quest and somewhat affecting overall saga experience.

The Gandalf art reminds me of the Gandalf cover art on the original Ralph Bakshi animated LOTR movie. I'm almost certain it was used as inspiration. I love it too.

You can keep to the storyline by using only Frodo, if you wish. If you do not own the expansion with Frodo - then you're not sticking to the storyline anyways.

Isn't Flame of Arnor breaking the Watcher in the Water?

In the (not hugely likely ) event you could play three Victory 1 cards, without entering the Doors of Durin or killing the watcher.

 

Or is the unlikelyness acceptable? Perhaps errata on the quest card?

Fortunately you have to guess, then shuffle your deck, and then discard the cards from your deck. So Gandalf won't help here.

## 106 [MyNeighbourTrololo on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1188069)

It wouldn't take it out entirely, as deck is shuffled before discarding. It would, however, provide you with the needed knowledge in case you're going to spend Bilbo resources for additional guesses.

## 107 [Raven1015 on August 7, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1188107)

Good point about Gandalf helping with the additional guesses. This could definitely allow you to spend your Baggins resources with 100% accuracy. To be honest, I'm not too concerned with a new hero helping out with an older quest, but the designers will definitely have to keep an eye out for future interactions like this for newer quests.

Precisely this. It is *extensively* clear in the books that Sam is a ringbearer. In the "Return of the King" sets he will have to be a ringbearer.

I must say I am a bit concerned about Gandalf being a non-sphere, an the potential risk that the player may be locked out with cards in hand. 

 

Tracker, since you have played him already:

 

1. I wonder how much you think Bifur was a factor in your success? Is he necessary or only convenient with Gandalf hero?

 

2. If there is no top-deck manipulation in your deck (no Imladris Stargazers or similar) would then Gandalf's non-sphereness be an issue?

 

I guess all I am asking is how much do you have to build around Gandalf being neutral.

## 110 [MyNeighbourTrololo on August 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1188908)

I think, Bifur is an excellent pair for Gandalf due to his low threat and ability to grab useless resources from Gandalf if needed.

Bifur is an extremely good hero for any multisphere deck, as he can alone pose as two Lore heroes, sort of. In my harbor master deck where Bifur is a single Lore hero, I could field behemoths like Gildor Inglorion on turn 2 without any stewards and else.

1. Yeah obviously I choose Bifur to pass Gandalf's resources, and that was certainly helpful at times in the early game, especially to get Gildor in, but late game I was not doing this at all. I used gandalf quite a bit to play the top card during planing for 2 cost spirit allies or attachments and later in the round if an event was on top he could play it, and possibly another event after that. So, Gandalf's resources were always being put to good use and I never felt like they were just piling up. I suspect this would be the case even without bifur, since if it was not for the high cost of Gildor I might not have had to pass any resources at all, but Gildor was essential to the deck as you'll read below.

Another thing thing that was good about Bifur is he is only 7 threat, so he is a really good fit for the deck with a starting threat of 26. Sure it would be cool to have Elrond, Gandalf, Glorfindel, but starting at 32 threat is usually a death sentence for even some of the most powerful heroes in Middle earth, and I was testing my deck on nightmare scenarios, JAtA and Khazad-dum scenarios, which it did fine on, almost made some of them easy, but not always.

2. I found Gildor to be almost essential to the deck. There were 6 cards that could could only be played by Gandalf and burning Brand needed to be played from the top of the deck to attach to Gandalf. There were numerous times when these cards showed up in my opening hand or I got cornered into having to draw them. With Gildor i could get those cards back in the deck to play again. I had Stargazers in the deck but took them out because Deck manipulation became Gildor's main role. Without him I could easily have gotten stuck with cards in my hand that were essential to the deck and now were unplayable.

So, yes I think top deck manipulation is going to be key if you are playing sphere specific attachments on him or you are splashing spheres that are not represented by any of your heroes. But if your doing any of the above it should not be an issue.

I can't say enough about how powerful his staff is. The extra resource early game is pretty incredible. Mid late game I was using it for card draw, and since I had Burning Brand on him I did not need the shadow removal, but it is another great option without the brand.

I think the most important thing to maximize Gandalf is readying effects. I had all 3 Unexpected courages on him If they showed up, and they usually did since card draw was so good in the deck, Expert Treasure hunter just became one of the best source of card draw in the game for a Gandalf deck at least.

Overall, Gandalf is pretty fun to play with, although there is a lot of deck manipulation and fiddley bits that might not make him a hit with all types of players, since it's a bit of work to set him up the way I was playing him, but there are other ways to play him, so he is not pigeon holed into one type of build which is great, and should fit into decks that just want to draw cards and play them without all the concern of getting dead cards stuck in hand.

## 112 [Tracker1 on August 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1188960)

One other thing, card draw was almost an issue sometimes, since drawing cards might mean i could get stuck with a card in my hand I could not play. So even if I had 3 Expert Treasure hunters in play with 3 questing heroes, i might only trigger it at all especially if I did not know what was below the card on top of my deck. If the next card was one that needed to be played from the top of the deck, I was would then be stuck drawing it next round, and now had to rely on Gildor to get it back in the deck.

So, drawing the whole deck like crazy was a bit counter productive, and I began to take a more cautious approach, but even so, by round 10 I'd usually almost gone through my whole deck, and this is leaving out many of the powerful draw cards that many of my other decks had relied on in the past. A large part of this is due to Gandalf's passive form of draw by playing the top card of the deck every so often, but his also came with the same risks I mentioned above, so it's a really interesting way to play.

That's why top deck manipulation is going to be key for the style of deck I was playing.

Thanks, Tracker, lots of very interesting observations. Certainly would not mind if you posted your decklist at some point ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

Now I cannot wait to play hero Gandalf myself. I like deck manipulation very much so this playstyle is very tempting.

 

I am happy to hear that his positive abilities overshadow the drawbacks. And good to hear he is "fiddly" but not "awkward" to use.

## 115 [Tracker1 on August 8, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1189029)

> Have you used Will of the West?

No, I thought of that, but it seems like a few step process. I'll first have to discard the card, then I will need Will of the West, and then hopefully the card will show up in way that I will not get stuck drawing it again, if it ahows up at all now that it has been reshufled into the deck, and if for some reason i get stuck drawing the same card again then It was all for nothing.

There might be some potential there, since Will of the West will at least give me another chance but it's not a solid solution like Gildor, and he also removes the need to discard the card first. Of course you get all that for the the cost of 5 resources. But with Biffur and Gandalf Staff I can get him in to play on turn 2 or when ever he shows up. I started to run 3 copies of him since he was so crucial. The extra copies are also nice combo with Flame of Anor, and Gildor in play can even make sure it happens.

I think another option if it's an ally and I'm playing spirit is to find a way to get the card in the discard pile, and if it is a splashed sphere ally use stand and fight.

Question about Gandalf staff and the Lonely mountain scenario hobbit #5.

Smaug makes additional attack if he is dealt a shadow card with a burgle effect. Smaug is also immune player card effects.

So, can Gandalf Staff be used to remove the shadow card, or does Smaug's immunity prevent this?

Smaug is not being targeted by the staff, it is the shadow card, so I'm not certain. If the shadow card could be removed it would make the scenario way easier.

## 118 [MyNeighbourTrololo on August 15, 2014](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112603-wow-gandalf-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1201268)

It's been already discussed many times. You target shadow card, not Smaug, so yes - you can discard it. But, if shadow card was already revealed and had burgle effect - discarding it will be of no use, as his additional attack will be already in motion.

You could discard the shadow card from Smaug for the reasons Trololo described, but you can't do it with Gandalf's Staff because it only applies to non-unique enemies.

I do not like the new Gandalf hero. This must have been raised before by someone, but you can build some ridiculously unbeattable solo deck with him.

I just tested a deck with :

Gandalf/Galadriel/Denethor

1 dwarven tomb

1 will of the west

2 legacy of numenor

3 Elrond counsel

3 Cram

3 Blood of numenor

3 fire of Gondor

3 daeron's rune

3 wealth of Gondor

And plenty of 0 casting cost cards (love of tales, healing herbs, expert treasure hunter, a good harvest, etc).

Basically, in your first planning phase you play until you reach dwarven tomb or will of the west (you activate Galadriel end draw it), then when the second card (dwarven tomb or will of the west) is on top of your deck, you play will of the west.

Then you start with a full deck and a will of the west in the discard, you play all the cards of the deck (playing the dwarven tomb on will of the west). When the deck is finished, you play will of the west and restart a loop.

If you are stuck with a card you cannot play in hand, you use the daeron's runes.

With each loop, you gain 3 will and 9 threat (elrond counsel), you lose 8 threat and earn 6 ressources with the 2 legacy of numenor.

So running a number of loops you want, you can choose to start the questing phase beeing at :

= 0 threat

= Xxxx ressources on each of your hero

= each hero at + xxxxx wi

Plus with cram and denethor, you can have the card you want from the encounter deck on top

Plus, if you are in a scenario, where you need to kill an enemy, you have Denethor with 3 Cram with Blood of numenor and fire of gondor and xxxx ressources on him to deal with the combat.

I cannot see that deck lose to any quest (healing herbes infinite to pass rhosgobel), except may be for Dol guldur if Gandalf is prisoner cancelling his ability.

Some cards need to be errataed !!

EDIT : no errata needed, gandalf power is limited once per phase, I will read the cards completely next time, sorry

Gandalf may only use his ability once per phase. You play the first zero cost card in planning, then you have to wait until the quest phase to do it again.
