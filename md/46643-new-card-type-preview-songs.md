checked the news, new type of card called song of kings gives a character a leadership sphere, seems useful, great artwork on the card

Looks like Wednesdays will be Lord of the Rings card preview day.

 

I like the Song of Kings, makes it easier to get the leadership benefits to a different deck without having to splash a leadership hero necessarily.

Yeah, might make a tactics/spirit/lore with select leadership cards doable. Aside from that, this would fit in well in my triple threat deck. Steward of Gondor on Beravor, lots of resources and enhanced options for her.

 Gah! It is already easy to mix Leadership with other spheres! Give the other spheres some love! 

There's also the preview for The Hills of Emyn Muil on the main LotR page. Not much new info, Gollum's trail has grown cold and you have to find more clues. Not quite as exciting sounding as sets 2-3, but the proof will be in the pudding.

Haha, exactly! It's like, "Leadership is clearly the best sphere, so now we've given you MORE ways to play it!"

Coming soon: Song of Nerds, Song of Jocks, and Song of Singers!

In all seriousness, though, it looks pretty cool. I definitely begin to see that deckbuilding will become a somewhat easier task.

This is really putting as a nail in the coffin here that Leadership and Spirit are meant to be played together - Aragorn with Celebrian's and the spirit hero with Song of Kings basically means a 2 2 hero split and and much easier way to bring both spheres into the game.

My hope is that the other spheres will get some Song loving as well.

Loving the Minstrell card as Lore is my deck of choice, but I'd rather a song to combine it with Spirit than Leadership

Interesting to note that the Rivendell Minstrell doesn't have the Minstrel trait. Probably an oversight.

I am sure there will be other song cards. It is only one preview, give it time. Maybe next week we will see another one. I might use this one in an all lore deck with some leadership cards splashed in and steward of gondor.

LOL.FFG is working for me.Now i can play sneal attack with all my decks and it's no need to have a leadership character in my decks.Also with the deck i run now (Eowyn,Aragorn,Eleanor) things are more easy for me.

Thanks FFG gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif].

I also wondered why. Perhaps the Elves do not get as many traits as others. Henamarth Riversong, for instance, also lacks other than the Silvan trait.

I also like Spirit Leadership deck.

I decided to concentrate on Tactics Lore and Spirit Leadership decks at first.

And then, when more cards come, on Tactics Leadership and Spirit Lore decks.

I actually refused to pay attention to Tactics Spirit and Leadership Lore - which they clearly advise here.

I would be shocked if we don't get others that will allow you to play cards from any sphere with any deck. Maybe not in the same pack but as more come out.
