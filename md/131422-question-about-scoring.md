# [Question About Scoring](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131422-question-about-scoring/)

Looking for a quick clarification about scoring.  The rules state that you add 10x the number of rounds taken.  Is this number of STARTED rounds or the number of COMPLETED rounds?  If you are keeping a round counter, do you advance it at the start of each round or at the completion of each round.

 

Put another way...

I know this is impossible, but it gets to the point of the question.  Hypothetically assume I started a game and completed the entire quest without ever having reached the end of the first round.  I never had to hit the very first Refresh phase.

     Would I add 0 to my score because I completed the quest without needing any (full) rounds?

          OR

     Would I be adding 10 to my score because I completed the quest in the first round? 

 

Thanks!

completed rounds!  Add 10 points at the end of the refresh phase.  So ignore the round in which you finished the game.

As GrandSpleen said. The answer is on p. 9 of the official FAQ (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=4]) -- I highly recommend you take a look at that document, as it may answer other (but not all) questions you may have about the game:

 

 

In addition to all elements currently used to score a game, players also add an additional 10 points to their “final group score” for each round of play that is taken to defeat a scenario. Players tally each round for their score at the end of the refresh phase.

oh! ok.  I counted it at the end of the game, starting at one round and going up one at the end.  so I guess I'll just start a 0! thanks guys!
