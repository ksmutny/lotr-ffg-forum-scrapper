# [Gondor Weapon Attachment?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120894-gondor-weapon-attachment/)

Really enjoying these new adventure packs, especially with the new Gondor ally Herald Of Anorien. Going to try this guy out today. Back to my topic. I would very much like to see another Gondor weapon attachment. I know there is Spear of the Citadel but it's really only good for certain defending characters. Gondor has very limited options for offensive weapons such as Blade of Gondolin and Dagger of Westernesse. Both Meh IMO. Maybe a Citadel sword or Gondorian bow would be great additions to a Gondor tactics deck.

Technically, Ranger Bow could be the thing you're describing and it's already in the game.

True, but I assume he's looking for something more aimed at Minas Tirith warriors than the rangers. While I don't think its absolutely necessary, it's probably something I'd be grateful to receive.

Your username is rather appropriate to this topic. For Rangers, the Ranger Bow is definitely a good weapon, and thematic. As far as Tactics is concerned, I honestly feel that Gondorian Fire is a really effective weapon. Leadership/Tactics Gondor is all about saving up extra resources on one hero, and cards like Steward, Gaining Strength, Wealth of Gondor and Horn of Gondor make this pretty easy to do.

 

I guess there could be a sword, but it would seem appropriate for it to work with extra resources - which Gondorian Fire already does. I honestly think that it is a good thing that outside of rangers Gondor does not get ranged. This is one of the strengths of Elves. Dwarves and Leadership/Tactics Gondor not having ranged (I don't count Hirluin as Gondor) is one of the things that gives the archetypes some balance. This pretty much rules out a Gondorian Bow.

Some very good points Dan.

I meant a weapon that is for Gondor. I have a Gondor focused Tactics/Leadership deck.

I agree with joezim007 you have some great points. I love Gondorian fire but it takes a while to build up strength. So I switched it out for Blade of Gondolin which is really only good for questing unless you're facing mass orcs. Also some quests punish you for questing too quickly. I suppose I could try adding Gaining Strength, Wealth of Gondor, and Horn of Gondor to my Tactics/Leadership deck, but I'd be trading out some good cards. I totally see your point about a Gondorian bow being out of the question but there should definitely be another weapon option besides Blade of Gondolin for Gondor IMO.

I had something like this in my cutom thug expansions. It was a leadershit weapon attachment that added +1 attack to the wielder, and +1 additional attack if another thug participated in attack with the wielder together. This concept could be used as a gondorian weapon with the trait swap. Also, another thought, is a gondorian weapon which gives the wielder +1 attack, and +1 additional attack if he has at least 1 resource in his resource pool, to support the overall gondor rich theme.

A couple of quick "out of the box" essays I made regarding your desire for gondorian weaponry.

Wow MyNeighbourTrololo I like all 3 examples you gave. You have my vote for weapon design =) You guys have inspired me to rework my tactics/leadership deck to include Gondorian Fire again with some of the above mentioned resource generating cards. Cheers!
