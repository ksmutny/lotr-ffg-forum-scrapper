As much as I dislike these nightmare decks for the sheer silliness of them, I am still really intrigued to see what they come up with for each scenario. Dead Marshes is probably the most-anticipated for me, though I can't coherently say why. Emyn Muil could be interesting as well. We'll have to see, though, I suppose!

Wish they ahd their playmats and deck boxes available to purchase as well when Nightmare goes PoD.

That Legolas.... mmmmm.
