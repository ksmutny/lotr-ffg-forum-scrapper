I recently picked up a copy of the core set and have played the game quite a bit lately and really like it. If you want to read more about my thoughts on the game you can do so here [http://obliquediversions.com/2011/06/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game/].

Most of the time I have spent playing or thinking about the game I have been focused on the game aspects like how to beat quests or construct decks but recently had the thought of do I like how the characters are represented. I like must say I like how Aragorn can do twice as much as other characters as well as how Faramir helps other characters willpower. I would like to hear what other people think on how well this game represents their favorite characters.

I think the characters abilities matching their personality in the books is pretty good, even though sometimes it can be a little spotty. Actually, I think the game is really good at giving me adventure ideas for the Decipher Lord of the Rings RPG game I run which is pretty sweet.

Ok, I'll try now.

My favourite characters are:

Boromir. One of the very few I began to like more after I had seen the film. Sean Bean portrayed him just so brilliantly. I really hope they'll do that one justice. Being one of the strongest warriors of his time but also mentally a bit fragile and overall torn. I picture him TL 11, W 1, A 3, D 2, HP 5 with some cool fighting ability, and either Leadership or Tactics. Perhaps he could get Horn of Gondor into play for free or something; or make it produce two resource instead of one.

Gandalf. Done very well.

Faramir. Done very well.

Glorfindel. I really wish his attack was 4, Noldor has been renowned for their fighting skills in Silmarillion. One who has seen the Light of the Trees should reflect that. But ok, he's still strong. And I'd play him no matter what, like Beorn, in one deck or another.

Beorn. Done very well. Like the bonus representing his Bear qualities. Similar to Gandalf in that effect.

Gildor Inglorion. Hope he's even in. And with some clever left-field trick up his sleeve.

Gollum. He won't be a hero or ally I deem.

Bilbo. Seen the preview, was not very glad about it. Hope they change it a bit for the final print, would seem very weak as it were.

I'd like to see some characters from Silmarillion, like Fingolfin or Huan, for those are my all time favourites. The copyright issues will most likely disallow that though. But I want more Noldors. And some cute benefitting card towards their trait. And I want to see more cards dealing with traits, we have got only a few: Gondor and Dwarf that come to mind (plus some enemies).

It is pretty sweet one playing one game gives you and idea for other games.
