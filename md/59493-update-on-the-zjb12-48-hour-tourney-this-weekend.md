 Hey!  I am still trying to work out the kinks yet, (I.e, I haven't won yet, but have made changes and think I am getting closer. ). I am also in e back of my head and looking at several of the threads today, trying to figure out game scoring, etc.  I will try and still post tomorrow, but I have a busy day between work, eye dr., and x-country skiing, and a meeting.  So hang in there!
