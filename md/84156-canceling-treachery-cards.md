When you cancel a "When Revelaed" effect on a Treachery card, (such as with "A Test of Will"), does it also cancel any Surge or Doomed text as well, or do they get played out first?

I can't seem to find a ruling on this.  Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!

the surge happens regardless of cancelling

however if you kill an enemy when it is revealed (eg. thalin) then the surge is cancelled
