I'm not sure of which heroes to put in the two decks for a run at the Lost Realm and the Angmar Awakens cycle.

 

Any help would be welcome.

I used this fellowship most recently for that cycle:

http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/1309 [http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/1309]

Argalad/Dain/Ori in one deck, Dori/Thalin/TaTheoden in the other, reliant on dwarven swarm/mining in one deck and every direct damage card in the game -- worked fairly well, except for Carn Dum (too tough) and Mount Gram (had to remake the decks completely).  There's an extremely high number of six hero sets with a higher potential upside than those six heroes!

What kind of decks do you like to play, and are you wanting to take down Carn Dum reliably in normal mode?  If you're not stressed about beating Carn Dum, you can virtually pick any six heroes and have fun.

I tend to play a lot of different decks (about the only thing they have in common is that most of the deck combos have hero Gandalf and a Aragorn, although not always in the same deck). I'm mostly just not sure if I should go with one deck doing the lion's share of the questing and the other doing the combat or have each deck be able to do everything to a degree.

I used Boromir...

I did solo one-handed with Gandalf, Lore Aragorn, Spirit Glorfindel. It beat Carn Dum second or third try. (Deadman's Dike was a bit hairy with a Gandalf deck so make sure to include those Wills of the West!)

Some of the quests spawn a lot of enemies, so if you split questing/combat you need to make sure you can cover enemies that engage with the "wrong" deck.  One of the quests (Escape from Mount Gram) has separate staging areas initially and starts with a single hero from each deck, but it's not a very hard quest, at least if you adjust your decklist to compensate for the unusual conditions.  All the quests have encounter side quests.

I decided to try two decks (one Aragorn (tactics), Beregond (Tactics) and Elfhelm and Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit) and managed to grind out a win against Intruders in Chetwood. Given a slightly better draw for the Elrond Gandalf Glorfy deck I can use Gandalf for emergency blocking purposes. I may well give these decks a try against The Weather Hills before I start making other changes.

Here are cool decks that i and my brother used to beat this cycle with only 2 losses (which were our fault since we did some mistakes...).

If you want more in depth strategy guide for these i can explain it to you. By the way this cycle has been my favorite so far. I think that the quests are just getting better and better :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]

I've tried Deadman's Dyke five times with multiple variations of the two decks I'm currently using (Aragorn (tactics), Beregond (Tactics) and Elfhelm and Elrond, Gandalf and Glorfindel (Spirit) and I'm getting nowhere near completing the quest. I can't shake the feeling that the two decks are spectacularly unsuited for this quest but I'm not sure about what to change it to.

What's killing you on the dike?  Threat, milling your deck, or those miserable cursed dead?

I’m running through this cycle now with this: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/7392/ally-light-noldor-discard-1.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/7392/ally-light-noldor-discard-1.0]

First two quests down without much issue, but we shall see how it holds up on the dike next time I get some time to play.

I've lost each of those but mostly getting buried by too many Fornost Squares at once seems to be my major problem.

I remember that from when I first played. I think I brought a Noldor deck which wanted to discard things anyways and that was quite successful.

The problem is that every time deck #1 discards a card it adds +1 threat to each Fornost Square (I think my worst luck was three in play at the end of planning on round one, that game went badly really, really badly).

There's only three copies of Fornost Square, one of which starts in staging, so all three in play is extreme luck.  Then you'd need some more bad luck with discarding treacheries for them to ramp up their threat on round one.  Ordinarily you can guarantee travel to one of three Fornost squares in your first turn, just leaving two in the deck to come out sometime.

Thror's Key would work well on Fornost Square, except that you have to get the key before it comes out.
