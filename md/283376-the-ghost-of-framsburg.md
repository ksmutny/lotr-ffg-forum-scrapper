Not to mention the possibility of getting a hidden cache and a couple free ered luin miners at the same time. This guy is bonkers!

Plus it goes on allies and heroes. Great in a Dale deck, but useful in other decks like Tactics/Lore trap decks or as stimpaksam mentioned dunedain. 

The song could be really good with an Eomer/Firefoot trample build.

Personaly not in love with mining archetype but a new dain hero who does not synergize with dwarf at all is a nice variant. He bring also something different that in spirit is not standard. Spirit Beregond is still your defender to go in sphare but dain seems flexible and fun enough to see some serious play. Let's see if the developers bring in some new strong discarding effect bringing the whole discard mechanic to the next level.

## 15 [dalestephenson on September 24, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283376-the-ghost-of-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3482087)

Spirit Beregond has the advantage of Sentinel, but being able to defend for six without help makes Dain better IMO for a single deck, especially with Noldor/mining that doesn't mind discarding.  Beregond does have the threat reduction, but there's plenty of threat reduction available in spirit.

I like the spoiled tactics cards.  Attachments on allies are great, and +1 to +3 attack is fantastic for non-ranged characters for one cost -- and tactics *or* warriors makes it fit a large number of allies.

Swift and Strong is lovely too -- for the low cost of exhausting a weapon and 1 cost, you can ready again *and* get +2 attack.  Powerful.

In the spread are a couple player cards that we don't get a separate picture  We don't see what the cost discount is on Man the Walls, but the inability to quest first turn isn't much of a downside.  This card should go really well in Ent decks using Leadership Faramir!

Valiant Determination could be great for expensive allies with well-rounded stats.  Faramir can boost himself with it.  But I think it would go especially well on Guardian of Esgaroth.

Mirkwood Hunter is interesting, but I can't imagine would be popular outside the yet-unborn Woodmen deck.

If I throw Valiant Determination on an Ally, then throw a Sword-thain on them... will the Valiant Determination still work?  (I'm guessing not)

Thinking about some allies that could especially benefit from Valiant Determination:

Wellinghall Preserver (sort of) -- a 3 willpower ally, but actually makes a fine self-healing defender with A Burning Brand.  Downside -- since its healing is connected with readying, won't actually heal unless it attacks/defend

Gildor Inglorion -- with 3 willpower and decent combat stats I rarely have used his action, but with this attachment he can use his action repeatedly.

Tactics Bofur -- only two willpower, but being able to use his action repeatedly after questing (if not used for combat) could draw out your weapons/armor quickly.

Mirkwood Explorer -- Mirkwood explorer gets his progress tokens from questing successfully, but has to exhaust in order to spend them.  With this he could do both on the same turn.

I don't think Valiant Determination it would work anymore after Sword-Thaining because the text says "Attached ally does not exhaust to quest".  If it said attach to an ally, but attached character does not exhaust to a quest, then it would continue working.

I agree that in solo dain gains value compared to Beregond. Especially if no tactic access is available to gondorian shield him. Dain is more flexible too as he can attack for 2 when needed. And yes, defend for 6 out of the gate at the cost of something (discarding) which could turn into an upside you  build around it. However the cost of repetebly  discarding can be taxing on the long run. At least he is in spirit so I guess it means includong will of the West x 2/3 copies to counter the card trashing. I cannot wait to try him in a deck and see what he bring on the table. I think he would work very well in a spirit/leadership deck to maximize his dwarf trait with king under mountain, shield and the other leadership dwarf goodies

I was bummed dwarf pipe was spirit and that was an issue with the new upcoming thorin, now it can have some use with Dain.

 

The woodman deck is getting some serious love. This cycle will have 3 cool decks buildable, Dale, woodman, and if we get thorin a new dwarf discard

If I may comment in a different direction, I think the setting for this quest is great. Fram Framson was one of my favorite characters in the Middle Earth CCG and I loved the sword Wurmsbane. I had a deck built around getting them out and kicking some serious dragon butt.

seeing some of that setting be acknowledged by the card game has me excited. Does this mean a potential Fram Framson hero down the road? One can dream!

I am always more interested in new quest ideas or themes than the new player cards - and this one really has me excited as it looks like a real undead dungeon crawl. Hopefully it will play well but this cycle is becoming one of the most looked forward to ever for me.

Valiant determination doesn't have a lot of good targets at this time. Most allies you want to quest with don't have a reason to do much else. 

The only really decent targets are Faramir, Rosie, Mirkwood Explorer, and the new dale allie that powers up with attachments

There are plenty of characters like bofur (tactics) that could quest for 2 and then use his ability but it doesn't seem worth it for the attachment. I do like it though it is a cool card 

Im excited for the cheaper with attachments ally most myself, I like that deck that's brewing 

## 31 [dalestephenson on September 25, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283376-the-ghost-of-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3482871)

If we include Rosie as a good target for being able to use her two willpower and also use her ability, you should also include any other two willpower allies that aren't dedicated questers.  Eagles of the Misty Mountains comes to mind immediately, they can get to really high attack/defense in an Eagles deck, but Gwaihir, Treebeard, Quickbeam, and Yazan all have 2 willpower with better combat stats (and there's a host of 2-wp allies with decent combat stats)

If we consider global willpower buffs the list expands considerably.  Kahliel's Headdress gives +1 wp to Harad allies, so that would expand the list to Jubayr and Kahliel's Tribesmen.  Visionary Leadership gives +1 wp to Gondor allies, so Boromir, Anborn, Veteran of Osgaliath, Defender of Cair Andros and even Warden of Healing would qualify (though he's too fragile to invest in, I think).  In a Dale deck Long Lake Trader would be a good choice.  And in an Outlands deck, virtually anyone might benefit.

## 32 [sappidus on September 25, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283376-the-ghost-of-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3482932)

To expand on @player1683311 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/189558-player1683311/]'s point: I question whether Valiant Determination is worth playing in the situation where all you get out of it is 2 WP. For 2 Spirit resources, we already have several good 2-WP allies that also have some kind of ability, so why not just slot those in your deck? For example, unlike Val Det they don't require you to wait to play them until you have the perfect ally on the board.

Of course, I grant there are situations where having 2 WP on an attachment (sort of) is useful—say, a quest which punishes players for the raw # of allies in play, or deals out a lot of direct damage to exhausted questers. And attachments are easier to fish out with things like Master of the Forge and Galadriel. And, Dale. Etc. Point is, you can certainly come up with uses for the card.

But overall, it seems quite bit more nuanced a deckbuilding decision than simply, "Hey, 2 WP [when I've already had to draw and play an ally with 2 WP printed on it that is still useful later in the round]!"

## 33 [dalestephenson on September 25, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283376-the-ghost-of-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3482990)

For 2 spirit resources, we have the following allies that provide 2 willpower:

Arwen Undomiel (awesome, but unique)

Bilbo Baggins (unique)

Escort from Edoras (goes away)

Curious Brandybuck (goes away)

West Road Traveler

Galadriel's Handmaiden

As a generic way of getting two willpower, I agree there's no real reason to include the attachment over WRT or GH, especially since with either of those you can just play the ally instead of having a suitable 2-wp ally in place already which is costly.  So unless you're trying to keep the ally count down (or avoid 1-hp allies) this isn't a general purpose card.

OTOH, if you're running a thematic tribal deck then you may not want any of the two-cost allies, but this is a generic card and isn't anti-thematic for any tribe.  Though except for Dale, most of the tribes that I think would benefit from the attachment for getting effectively +2 wp aren't usually running spirit.  I don't think it's going to be a staple card by any means, unlike Unexpected Courage.

## 34 [Halberto on September 25, 2018](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283376-the-ghost-of-framsburg/?do=findComment&comment=3482992)

I agree that in spirit it is not automatically an automatic include becouse of all the cheap 2w /2 costs cards available on sphere. However it is something we never had before in this form and it can suits very well the role of utility card to expand today available toolbox. Not a staple but not to dismiss either. Let's see some months after release what players come to use it for.

Maybe a bit offtopic, but while I play the game for years, I never found a way to use the discard mechanism in other decks than Noldor - where I use it very much indeed. 

 

So I would like someone to help me on this ... why should I want to discard cards to give Dain more defense than put his a shield or something to help him on this? Ok there is Hidden cache or Ered Luin miner , but other than that I cant find a way to use this mechanism in a dwarf deck ... you risk losing cards that could be useful the way I see it (and off course I am missing something, thats why I ask for help)

There's a lot to write about mining, but I want to quickly address this point: think about how far you get down into your player deck during a regular game. Most builds don't drill down through the entire deck, right? There's often a good number of cards not drawn even at the end of a quest.

So, those (randomly chosen!) cards are in a sense no more useful to you than those discarded through mining. And in a mining deck, you are presumably getting some positive use out of the mining, e.g., boosting Spirit Dain's defense and/or hitting a Hidden Cache, so overall you shouldn't really worry about it that much

As ever, things are much more nuanced than the short summary, but I think the principle that mined cards are generally no worse than undrawn cards is good to keep in mind. Once you're mining way more cards than you would have had undrawn (which Dain might facilitate), the calculus starts to get complicated…

Defensive attachments have to be first drawn and then paid for. Dain's ability is available right from the start of the game without needing anything else in play. As far as the risk of losing useful cards, how often do you draw your entire deck in the course of a game? Because until you empty your deck those cards you discarded could just as easily have been the ones on the bottom of your deck which you just never drew. You don't get them either way. Except since Spirit also has cards like Dwarven Tomb and Stand and Fight, you can potentially pick the ones you want out of your discard pile, and this ends up being a lot easier than trying to actually draw all of them into your hand.

Because you can't even play all the 2 WP ally: Arwen, Bilbo, ethir swordman, handmaid, the rohan one who switch the location. And I may even forget some. Even with an ability irrelevant you still can put all of them in quest, and that 2 WP more than valiant determination can never bring. And this don't need any combo, where valiant determination do nothing if you don't have the right ally in play first.
It is a card who be optimal in very few cases, in only a few decks.

While the mining dwarves are getting there pretty fast as we can see, IMO LeadershipDáin-less dwarves need some serious willpower boosts to be playable solo (as a strict tribe obviously). Once you take away LDáin's boost, you're left off with some pretty underwhelming Spirit dwarves. Combat shouldn't be an issue though, as Tactics Dwarves and axes are still pretty strong (also presumably Thorin III is going in the deck). But it's the willpower I'm worrying about. As ridiculous as it might sound, I would love to get a 2-cost 2-willpower spirit dwarf to compensate for the lack of global boosts and raw willpower in Dwarf allies.

As for @TheSpitfired [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240687-thespitfired/] point: As much as MECCG had Fram as a playable character, he's way out of timeline for our game. My money is on Fram being the final boss in the scenario, the eponymous Ghost of Framsburg we have to fight in order to get Wormsbane. Why would he impede us from getting it and slaying a dragon? Well, ghosts grow surly in their tombs and we are grave-robbing him. He might want to "test" our worthiness for using his legendary sword by fighting us. Makes sense IMO.

To come at it from the other direction, speaking purely within Spirit, Valiant Determination can be considered being 2 resources for 2 attack—an excellent exchange rate in Spirit—when played on the likes of a Northern Tracker or Rhovanion Outrider, allies you often want to be questing with. Still draw-order dependent, but worth a thought.

Ok there is Hidden cache or Ered Luin miner , but other than that I cant find a way to use this mechanism in a dwarf deck ... you risk losing cards that could be useful the way I see it (and off course I am missing something, thats why I ask for help)  

Imagine instead that it discards the bottom cards of your deck. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] But seriously, Dwarf mining is quite a strong archetype and Dain fits right in.

@sappidus [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/251007-sappidus/] That's the whole point of the card in my opinion. Like others stated, two extra willpower isn't scarce in Spirit, but two attack is certainly profitable. And don't forget the big neutral allies like Thalion or Treebeard. Hmm. Valiant Determination looking good in a Caldara deck.

I think you have it. Those allies are not the classic cheap 2w/2costs bodies spirit can so easily throw in.

 

Both are expensive, useful allies which bring something different on the table when questing and have strong combat stats to be put at use later in the turn.

I did miss Ethir Swordsman as a 2-for-2, though if it's in a full Outlands deck Valiant Determination could be well worth playing on a well-rounded Outlands.

New Dain has synergy with mining targets like Ered Luin and Hidden Cache, but the "Dwarven Mining" deck often has LeDain to buff the dwarves.  With that said, I think Spirit Dain would fit just fine with a couple of Noldor and a Noldor-heavy deck -- or with Caldara.  If you're worried about the cards he'll discard, give him Dwarf Pipe.  This Dain can be splashed, rock solid defense is one of the things I love most.  Too bad he doesn't have sentinel, though he's a sphere match for Arwen.

Dain + Dori can defend for eight without any attachments, events, or allies.  Insane.

I think we're missing that Dwarves need massive willpower. Dwarf mining could easily function as a combat deck that also throws a little willpower to the rest of the group

It is possible that some killer card to enable dwarf discard archetype and push it the next level is lurking in the depth of the unspoiled card of this cycle...

I take back Rosie as a good target, I was thinking you would give her willpower boosts and get double duty out of her, but when people do that it is because they have sword thained her which nullifies the attachment. 

My point was in line with what others have clarified, just play a 2 cost ally with 2 willpower. 

But maybe we will get some better targets for it.

Yes Rosie currently isn't a good target - but given all the ally attachments we've seen in this cycle, can a willpower-boosting attachment be missing?  That would rock on Rosie.

Massive willpower I agree, but without Dáin most Dwarves in Spirit/Tactics (which would appear to be the main spheres in the mining archetype, considering Thorin) have a huge lack of willpower IMO. Untroubled is good, but an event and thus not reliable as normal, regular amounts of willpower are. Some hypothetical attachment that read "Response: After one or more cards are discarded from the top of your deck, Dwarf allies you control get +1 willpower until the end of the round (Limit once per round)" would be perfect.

I think Valiant Determination is good in a Dale deck, one with Brand son of Bain. With the +1 Willpower to allies with a player attachment, even low willpower allies can chip in and serve another function. Guardian of Esgaroth would a a 3/2/2/2 that doesn’t exhaust to quest. It’s 4 resources, but Dale has a way to make allies cheaper. If a few more good Dale allies show up, it could be very strong.

> As for @TheSpitfired [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240687-thespitfired/] point: As much as MECCG had Fram as a playable character, he's way out of timeline for our game. My money is on Fram being the final boss in the scenario, the eponymous Ghost of Framsburg we have to fight in order to get Wormsbane. Why would he impede us from getting it and slaying a dragon? Well, ghosts grow surly in their tombs and we are grave-robbing him. He might want to "test" our worthiness for using his legendary sword by fighting us. Makes sense IMO.

Heh. For some reason I had the distinct impression that Fram Framson in MECCG was the descendant of the Fram Framson that killed Scatha. No idea where I got that from, I see it might not be the case seeing the timeline of events.

At any rate, I like your theory and will take it! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Wait I thought this was the guy who slew the dragon and who the rohirrim were descended from, is that not correct?

Yes, which is why I don’t think he could have a descendent named Fram Framson still living in Framsburg. 

The one in the Middle Earth CCG must have been that very one.

Related, not necessarily descended from, but yes. The Rohirrim/Eotheod, Beornings, woodmen, and men of Dale/Esgaroth were all close in blood.

I have to say that the art of the new Dain seems more appropriate for D&D than for LotR lcg.

and also, is the Led Dain going to be errated to gain the Noble trait ever...?

I don't think so. It is not the first heroes to be printed with two different identity: one with noble and one without. There is at least Aragorn, probably also Faramir.

Leadership Dain is in his youth (so maybe not a noble yet) , while the spirit one seems to be fighting on his last battle as King ?
