2016 is here! New year means new beginnings. Hopefully at least. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]

 

What do you hope to see or predict in this year for LotR?

 

I hope to see more beornings. I want to see that trait developed.

 

I also want to see Doomed and the Encounter keyword get some more love.

 

My biggest hope is to see more Tactics support. I long for the day to make a viable mono tactics deck for solo that has a decent chance at winning a good chunk of quests. I still feel it's not quite there yet.

Saruman hero.

I would love a Doomed archetype or "pack" of cards centered around Saruman hero and Artifacts. Palantir, rings, staff etc. That would be so cool, but any of those things for separate would be great as well.

Other than that, it seems like we will get lots of book and ffg created unique allies, which is nice.

The Woodsman deck is slowly cooming to its well deserved top notch place, but would need a few key cards to nail it. Maybe just a few allies, a few events and a hero. But its a close call already.

Saruman hero would be immensely fun, but I wonder where he would fit in the next cycle and/or saga expansions (well, evidently not in the saga expansions...).

 

I would like to see more development of the encounter keyword cards.

Thranduil.

 

I also would very much like to see a Dwarf hero who supports or otherwise interacts with the slowly developing "discard from deck" dwarf miner deck.

Hah!  Love it.

 

Forced: When 3 shadow cards are in play, Thaurdir attacks the first player, deals an additional shadow card to each enemy in play, heals 3 damage from each enemy, and jumps the shark.

A doomed/Saruman theme would be interesting, especially if there were effects or abilities that increased the threat elimination level.

 

I feel this would be appropriately thematic. Saruman may have access to certain foresight and powers due to his toying with the powers of darkness, and due to his formidable power he could resist Sauron a bit longer than most.

 

For instance, I think it'd be neato to have a Saruman hero who could "soak up" a certain number of threat caused by the doomed keyword (i.e., put travel markers on Saruman equal to the doomed value to prevent the increase in threat, up to a certain max of travel markers, possibly with an expensive way to remove such markers). Or maybe Saruman (or another card) could flatly increase the threat elimination level beyond the standard 50.

 

Of course, many cards in the associated release would have the doomed keyword. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]

Raising the threat elimination level is brilliant for Saruman/Doomed. Perfect ability for an attachment IMO, similar to Favor of the Valar.

I would actually like to see a dual sided hero that could have totally different abilities or stats or icons (but same starting threat) that you could either flip mid game by paying resources or discarding cards.

> I would actually like to see a dual sided hero that could have totally different abilities or stats or icons (but same starting threat) that you could either flip mid game by paying resources or discarding cards.

That hero wouldn't work with various game mechanics that involve heroes being flipped facedown/shuffled into the deck, etc. So I don't see that happening. Closest thing I see is a hero that consists of a couple of cards that are interchanged dinamycally during play.

My wish for 2016 would be a return to Mirkood (hehe), for multiple reasons.

First we don't have a Thranduil hero and a Mirkwood theme would fit his release quite well.

Second Mirkwood and it's surroundings were part of the first cycle. So it's been quite long since we have been there and not all quests were that great.

Third there are still some unused areas. We could travel east to the lonely mountain and rhûn, which aren't visited outside the Hobbit saga (+ battle of laketown). Also we could maybe help Galadriel in the destruction of Dol Guldur.

I dont see any problem about repeat locations in new cycles. For example, Mirkwood Forest, but instead searching for Gollum, it might Silvans (thranduil) fighting and quitting out ambush orcs.

I recently read the passage where Wídfara makes his only appearance. An ally version of him would be great this cycle. A Lore Rohan ally with some encounter deck scrying ability sounds pretty cool.

My main hopes relate to player cards that I want for a thematic Saga campaign.

 

Since the Dream-Chaser cycle includes "a high concentration of expensive and unique allies," I'm hoping for an ally version of Aragorn, to use in solo A Knife in the Dark and Flight to the Ford.

 

I'd like Merry and Pippin allies (probably in Flame of the West or the sixth LOTR Saga box) for solo The Ring Goes South and Journey in the Dark.

 

I don't know if we'll get this in 2016, since they might save it for future deluxe expansions, but I'm hoping for another Gimli or Legolas hero that would allow the three hunters to beat The Uruk-Hai.

 

I'd like a new Rohan hero for two-handed Helm's Deep, using only characters that participated in the battle. Grimbold would be fun, and would allow for a Gandalf-Erkenbrand-Grimbold deck that represents the reinforcements, together with a Théoden-Éomer-Gimli deck (perhaps subbing in a new version of Legolas, since Tactics hero Legolas is horrible at this quest). Grimbold was known for his valour and was an important commander at the Fords of Isen and at the battle of Pellinor Fields: he's the most significant Rohan character that we haven't yet seen. Hero Gamling (which seems unlikely so soon after the ally, but would allow some combination of Théoden, Éomer, Háma, Gamling, Gimli and Legolas as heroes) or an FFG-created Rohan hero could also work. I could always play Helm's Deep solo, but that feels much less epic.

 

More broadly, I'd like more support for secrecy and tricksy ways to deal with enemies, ideally themed so that it doesn't clash with hobbits (A Elbereth Githoniel works, but not Ride Them Down). During the Grey Company's book club discussion of A Shadow of the Past, they mentioned that it's unthematic that the quest essentially forces you to fight the black riders. Obviously it's tricky to balance powerful effects like A Elbereth Githoniel, but I'm hoping the sixth saga box (which we might get this year) will include some powerful events and attachments to support players who want their decks to be more focused on Frodo and Sam than high-threat heroes and an army of allies. I loved Staff of Lebethron and Taste it Again (and appreciated In the Shadows) from The Land of Shadow, and would like to see more cards like them.


## 22 [JonofPDX on January 5, 2016](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197489-2016-wishespredictions/?do=findComment&comment=1971662)

Radagast Hero and the return of the creature keyword. 

 

We haven't seen a creature card since...Gwaihir? And Bill the Pony before that? And before that it was all the way back in Mirkwood. Would love to see more creatures introduced.

 

Maybe more Eagles, but I would love to see other animals as well. There are a lot of forest creatures that could fit the bill--maybe some wolves or hounds as a counterpoints to the wargs. Giant boar, stags, elk, moose or bears could all conceivably be very dangerous in combat. Or even things like moths that could be used to scout the encounter deck or deliver messages (exchange cards or resources). 

 

And if we are going to see the return of creatures there would be no better time for the return of Radagast. I've already talked in more detail about how much I would love a new Radagsat hero elsewhere but something like this could be awesome:

 

Neutral Hero. [11-threat cost]. 3/2/2/4. Resources from Radagast's resource pool may be used to pay costs associated with any Creature, Mount, or Eagle card. Action: Exhaust Radagast to put a Creature ally from your hand into play. That ally gains: "At the end of the round, shuffle this card back into your deck."

 

Add in a Radagast spell and attachment ala the Gandalf treatment (perhaps a staff or cloak for the attachment and some kind of creature related buff or summon for the spell) and you would have a very solid Hero that works both mechanically and, I think, thematically. His power isn't the best in the world but it works to facilitate existing creature effects and it makes sense that the beasts of Middle-Earth would come to his aid. 

 

And remember, Radagast and Gandalf could share spells as Flame of Arnor is not limited to Gandalf.

That would be awesome. Would love to see a Tactics Elrohir and Leadership Elladan ally so that we weren't locked in to always using those two heroes together (and by necessity, Tactics/Leadership).

I have often wished that the core game had come with an additional phase for sneaking and stealth. Perhaps sneaking past an enemy would keep it in the staging area, but would exhaust it to represent sneaking past it; exhausted enemies wouldn't make engagement checks, but could be optionally engaged, and their threat would be reduced by one, to a minimum of one.  Exhausted enemies wouldn't ready in the Refresh phase; once you've managed to sneak past the enemy, you don't need to do it again. When a quest card is completed, exhausted enemies would be shuffled back into the deck. You could then have encounter cards featuring keywords that interacted with this mechanic, such as an Alarm keyword that readied all enemies in the staging area.

 

Obviously, it would need to be balanced (I'm no game designer!), and it would probably have called for an additional attribute on player cards, but I really would have liked to have had that option as opposed to always needing to charge in with guns blazing. I think the best that I could hope for would be player cards that had this effect on enemies in the staging area, but having it as a core mechanic really would have made the game feel more three-dimensional, in my opinion.

I totally second the creature trait. Of course getting a new Radagast is another possibility, but I prefer cards that make older (weaker) cards stronger. It is a task indeed with Radagast but not an impossible one. If we get more creatures -- dogs would be great -- for instance.

 

Yes, many unique allies coming up. I really like that, and I think we can expect Aragorn for sure, Elladan and Elrohir very likely. Judging by the recent Rohan spoilers, it can be pretty much anybody.

 

Surely a new Elrond hero is coming up? I still puzzle my brain about the second Grey Havens hero, and hope to see spoilers soon. Maybe this week?

 

Thranduil hero must be in the mix as well.

 

And I keep crossing fingers for Tom and Goldberry -- allies.

So much this. A cute Goldberry drawn by Magali is a priority for this game.

 

As for how they could work them into the game, well, the forsaken Encounter keyword would have been perfect! Just put a clause in there to the effect of "no more than 1 copy of a card named Tom Bombadil/Goldberry can be in the encounter deck at a time" (to avoid multiples in Old Forest/Barrow-downs) and you're set. Ideally they would have a shadow effect similar to Ranger of Ithilien so you can still take control of him if he comes as a shadow card.

 

The second hero in the Grey Havens is a mystery. Actually I don't think it necessarily has to be an elf, since the deluxes don't need to have just one theme, and there seems to be some participation of Gondor in the story as well.

Do we know the sphere? My guess is a hero Galdor of the Havens. Even if it was just a carbon copy of the ally it would be pretty awesome.

We know it's not gonna be Leadership, as the heroes in pack 1 and 3 are Leadership. I guess it's gonna be Lore. Galdor is a possibility, though maybe a bit boring and obscure (but then again, we got friggin Dwalin in Khazad Dum). Could be.

Same waves here. The encounter keyword would be very interesting, especially for Bombadil.

 

But as for the last paragraph, this is not based on preference but from experience, the deluxe boxes always had the same race/nation trait of the two heroes: Khazad Bifur & Dwalin, Númenor Boromir & Beregond, Isengard Éomer & Gríma, Realm Aragorn & Halbarad.

I would much prefer Gildor to Galdor. He is a Rivendell elf (though traveling to the Havens as he meets the Hobbits). In contrary to the above, a Gondor sailor would be interesting, too. Will they go for a made-up name in the deluxe?

If I had to guess, I would put my money on an elf whose name starts with "G" and ends in "ldor". Galdor is my first choice, Gildor my second. Honorable mention goes to Geldor, Goldor, and Guldor.

Fun fact: Galdor is the last character present at the council of Elrond whom we do not have in hero form.

> I know this is random and does not apply to the above formula, but I really like Gwindor (from the Children of Húrin / Silmarillion).

 

Agreed! Definitely a complex character.

Works for me.

Exhaust Guldor to search you deck for an eagle card and add it to your hand. Shuffle your deck.

Exhaust Geldor to shuffle an enemy creature back into the encounter deck.

Exhaust Goldor to add one resource to a hero you control.

I have some speculation for the story of the cycle. So apparently in Flight of the Stormcaller we are looking for a stolen artifact from a pirate. In The Thing in the Depths, we encounter and team up with the pirates, and in the article for Temple of the Deceived we know we have a key for a hidden chest. Is the key the artifact? If so, after finding the chest we will unlock no doubt something out of the chest. It would be cool if whatever object the chest holds then becomes an objective attachment, just like an objective ally, for the rest of the cycle. That would be so cool. And since apparently Sahír is an objective ally in Temple, we will be accopaining him in looking for the chest. Maybe at the end of that scenario he will turn on us to take the chest himself, and we fight to fight him as a boss enemy. That way we would not have so many objectives as well.
