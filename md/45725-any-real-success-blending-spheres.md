 I tried splashing a Glorfindel with my Aragorn and Theodred tonight, because I've been in desperate need of healing. The healing helped, but I wasn't really any more successful than before. Keep in mind I only have 1 core set currently.. 2 more will arrive tomorrow. Anyone come across any great combinations from different spheres?

I don't know about this deck, kinda luck based against the hill troll?

I had a tough Leadership/Spirit deck with Aaragorn, Eowyn and Theodred. Basically Theodred quests with Eowyn to increase her resource production, Aragorn can always take that attatchment that gives him a Spirit resource sphere and then you just play Wandering Tooks and Guards of the Citadel/Snowborn etc. to sponge enemy attacks while you hold out for Unexpected Courage (on Aragorn) and Sneak Attack/Stand and Fight with Gandalf. I won the 2nd quest with it with 37 points so it was good, but not perfect!
