Yes, it is... I discovered that yesterday, when I was playing "The road to Isengard", scenario with my Noldor deck (Erestor, Arwen, and Cirdan), and...  as I didn't played the scenario since a few months, I didn't remember the wording on the 3B stage...

So... yes, after revealing that, I first laughed, then I cursed Erestor for betraying me, and started the scenario again with another hero :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png]

Could you still avoid the loss with Silver Harp?

New challenge: Beat this quest with mandatory Erestor Lore hero at your disposal. Solo.

> Could you still avoid the loss with Silver Harp?

I would say no.  The passive effect on the quest card comes before the response on Silver Harp.  Erestor's text seems to indicate you discard your entire hand all at once.

I had an Harp attached to Cirdan by the moment the quest was resolved, but... the harp is a response, and returns card to hand when it's discarded, so... there's a moment in which you hand is empty and then you loose because Erestor is a ******* traitor who sells you to Saruman.  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]  :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

There is really a chance to beat the quest with this deck...

 

start the game with Erestor. Let Erestor die by the midgame, and the turn you are going to win... resurrect him with Fortune or Fait. I cannot see other way :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png] :lol: :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]

 

You can always use sword-thain to keep a lore hero at the table.

I think there is a way to beat it in the same round that you have to fight Saruman.  It's been a while, so I can't remember for sure.  But there's your challenge.

There's a card in the quest that treats text boxes as blank.
