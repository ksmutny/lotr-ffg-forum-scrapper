I've read all the threads I could find re: Landroval but for some reason I cannot determine if any attachments (good or bad!) will come back with your rescued Hero -- Example: Legolas, with 3 damage, the condition attachment "Freezing Cold', and the 'Support of the Eagles' attachment was just killed and I know I can use Landroval to bring him back with only one point of damage, but what happens to his 2 attachments?

When a character leaves play, all attachments on them go to their assigned discard piles. At this point, the game forgets that they were ever attached, and bringing back the character by whatever means doesn't bring back any of the attachments.
