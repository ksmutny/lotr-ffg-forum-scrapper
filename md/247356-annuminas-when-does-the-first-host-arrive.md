# [Annuminas; when does the first Host arrive?](https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247356-annuminas-when-does-the-first-host-arrive/)

When playing the fellowship event, we had a difference of opinion on the timing of the Host of Angmar.  Stage 1f of the quest says:

Forced: At the beginning of the round (before the resource phase), place 1 resource here.  Then, if there are 4 resources here, advance to stage 2.

Stage 2f says;

Forced: At the beginning of the round, and 1 set aside Host of Angmar (from any state's set aside area) to this staging area.

I felt this would happen one after the other, but some other players felt the start of turn would have past before you move on to 2f. Thefore you would not see a Host til your second turn there.  I'm running an epic multiplayer game on Saturday, and I'm hoping to get some confirmation on how this works.

If a card enters play as a consequence of some trigger, then the new card can't respond to that trigger. So unless there's something special about the "beginning of the round" trigger, then this effect shouldn't happen until the second round.

Do you have a reference for this?

It agrees with my past lotr play experience and so seems like it might be correct, but it certainly wouldn't be true in Call of Cthulhu - where responses/forced are valid if the thing in question happened anytime during the current Action/Response window, regardless of whether the card in question was 'in play' or any variation on 'being around to see it happen'.

Wow, I thought for sure, since stages 2b and 2d get an extra card (or possibly extra attacks in 2b's case) the first turn it was the same for 2f.  The guys will be glad to get the free turn to prepare.  Thanks!

They will need it ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] These Hosts are nothing to sneeze at. We handled them with a nearly full geared Beregond (Gondorian Shield + Raven-winged Helm + Burning Brand + Armored Destrier). Only Captain of Gondor was missing because the encounter deck stole it from us before the Brand was equipped (**** you Sorcery of Carn Dum!). That's "only" 2 damage per round (taken care of by Warden of Headling) and the Host itself was put to the sword by some really angry Booming Ents. I definitely can recommend Ents in this scenario because you have some time to build up your board state in phase 1 and they are great at taking archery damage to there advantage!

Nothing a Gimli(Le) - Dori - Combo can't serve :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]
