For anyone worrying that custom cards will now be returned in search results - don't. Unless you specifically filter for it (e.g. Set = First Age or Sphere = Mastery), or check the "Custom" box, custom cards will not be returned in the search results. Only official cards are returned by default.

Enjoy!

Great news! I have started to play the quests and it is really worth getting a set printed. Cant wait for expansions to come out for it!
