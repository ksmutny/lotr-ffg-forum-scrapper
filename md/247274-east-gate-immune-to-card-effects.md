Am playing Into the Pit and I've got East Gate in the staging area and a Northern Tracker in play -- if I commit him to the quest, can I place a progress token on East Gate? Â Am not sure exactly what East Gate is immune to/from?

Northern tracker wouldn't place any progress on it. If I remember right, East Gate can't be affected by pretty much anything, even dreadful gap. You just have to travel to it and quest hard.

Since East Gate is immune to card effects and starts active, you can't get it into the staging area.

Thanks -- I think I was playing wrong -- I've got it now!
