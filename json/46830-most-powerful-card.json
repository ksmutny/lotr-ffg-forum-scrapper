I think there are a lot of cards that are very conditional, i.e. that can be extremely powerful when played in the right situation, but as often as not just sit on your hand until the end of the game.\n\nConsidering cost, overall level of power and playability, which card do you consider the most powerful? (Out of the core set cards and considering play in a pool consisting of core set cards only).\n\nThere are a lot of really strong cards in my eyes, but one card I always play and always helps me a great deal is: Steward of Gondor. Resource management is really important in this game and often I want to cast that 4-cost ally but just never seem to have enough resources. SoG is insane, an extra two resources per turn is a power-up that is unmatched by any other card in the core set. Especially in a two sphere this deck, having SoG in the early game often decides between winning and losing. Also the relative low cost at 2 makes this card very easy to play.\n\n(Although it sucks that if I play it in the planning phase I cannot instantly use it to play other allies or attachments)\n\nWhat other cards do you have in mind?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46830-most-powerful-card/?do=findComment&comment=469011","commentId":469011,"userName":"BudSinigaglio","timestamp":1305503141,"content":"Two words: Northern Tracker.\n\nEvery game we play he either shows up and we win or he doesn't show up and we are overwhelmed by locations and our threat levels hit 50.\n\nThere are some sweet cards out there but our game ALWAYS comes down to that.

Sure, it helps generate resources, but you need something worthwhile to use those resources on. The one card, I find useful in almost all situations is (surprise) Gandalf. But I'd like to highlight another card, I like getting into play, namely Unexpected Courage, in particular when playing Beravor. UC lets me use Bera's power an extra time (or let's me quest/defend/attack and then draw cards), which let's me draw more cards, giving me more options. Other heroes can also make good use of UC, say Glorfindel or Denethor to name a couple.

What a card in combination with Gandalf (obviously) but also with Beorn for instance (although I am yet to try the combo - and to design purple red deck). I would add Ever Vigilant to this strategy as well - you get to defend and attack with a mighty ally for the cost of 2. And you can even use Sneak Attack to quest (but only for a phase either way), at least I understand you can, I had thought otherwise, still have not read the official FAQ on this one.\n\nThere are so many useful cards, of course. So many great attachments. I have just remembered playing Magic so many years back and could recall that attachments were mostly useless as far as I was concerned. Here where your heroes are to stick the whole game, attachments are so useful even though you can still lose them (but not very likely yet). The three biggies there (and mentioned) would be Celebrian's Stone (if you play that striding ranger rascal), Steward of Gondor and Unexpected Courage. But all spheres have been equiped greatly already. Blade of Gondolin is so mighty with Legolas. And Forest Snare can be a great relief.\n\nAs for the allies, the Spirit sphere seems poorest safe the mighty Northern Tracker. Yes, what a card. I like Beorn very much (not least thematically) although he is rather expensive.\n\nSpirit heroes also seem weaker than others but Dunhere is great. Glorfindel I like most perhaps - I tend to be bias with Noldor.\n\nWell, I am sorry not to have answered the question yet, just ranting about. I will now.
