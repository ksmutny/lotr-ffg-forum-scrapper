All versions of Aragorn present in the core set and expansion packs so far have been heroes, which would suggest an ally version of Aragorn since otherwise the text \"or Aragorn\" would be unnecessary.\n\n \n\nHowever, I disagree with this analysis: I think the text is \"Attach to a (sphere symbol) hero or Aragorn\". I can't tell what the sphere symbol is -- maybe Lore. But even if the symbol is Lore or Leadership, the \"or Aragorn\" text would still make sense, since both the Lore and Leadership versions of Aragorn should thematically be able to carry Andúril. So I don't think the Andúril card suggests an Aragorn ally, as awesome as that would be to see."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113342-the-road-darkens-is-not-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=1201427","commentId":1201427,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1408111183,"content":"rivendell-bow-twitw.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/rivendell-bow-twitw.jpg]\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113342-the-road-darkens-is-not-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=1201473","commentId":1201473,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1408112153,"content":"> (Rivendell Bow)\n> \n>  \n\nWith no text in your post, it's hard for me to tell what point you're trying to make. If you're simply pointing out that we've seen this kind of \"Attach to _______ or Aragorn\" text before, and so there's no particular reason to suppose Andúril will be anything new, then I agree. If you're making some other point, you'll need to explain it to me, because I can't guess your meaning from an image-only post.\n\n \n\nEdit: Wait, I think I can guess the point you're making. That if Andúril says \"Attach to a hero or Aragorn\", there's no reason why that would mean an ally Aragorn is coming. But Rivendell Bow doesn't prove that point at all: quite the reverse, in fact. The reason why \"or Aragorn\" was needed on Rivendell Bow is because he does not fit into the categories of \"Noldor character\" or \"Silvan character\", and so an exception needs to be carved out for him. But Aragorn does fit into the category of \"hero\", so the \"or Aragorn\" part of Andúril's \"Attach to a hero or Aragorn\" text (if that's what it says) would be completely unnecessary if there were no new ally versions of Aragorn coming. Because if there were nothing but the two hero Aragorn versions we have, then the card could just as easily read \"Attach to a hero\". So if the card's text is \"Attach to a hero or Aragorn\", then it does suggest an ally version.\n\n \n\nHowever, as I said before, I think the Andúril text reads \"Attach to a (sphere symbol) hero or Aragorn\". If that's the case, then it doesn't suggest an ally version of Aragorn, because whatever that sphere symbol is, there's at least one Aragorn card that doesn't match it. Which means the extra \"or Aragorn\" text is needed anyway.\n\nEdited August 15, 2014 by rmunn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113342-the-road-darkens-is-not-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=1201530","commentId":1201530,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1408113301,"content":"I can't tell if Anduril is one of the \"Setup\" boons that you get at the start of the game.  It probably isn't because that would be pretty strong.  But, if it is a setup boon and it doesn't have the [sphere] requirement, that would suggest there is an Aragorn objective ally because that would be the only way to have a non-hero Aragorn in play during setup."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113342-the-road-darkens-is-not-at-gencon/?do=findComment&comment=1201768","commentId":1201768,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1408117970,"content":"Currently, the attachment condition of Andruil is concealed.
