I still think it should be phrased \"play or put into play\"... Although I suppose that brings up whether you can trigger, say, ally Galadriel's ability when she gets played via this effect...

(Note that this does not include Fili/Kili in this case, since their texts explicit specify that it must be the planning phase... [unless you completed the sidequest during the planning phase using Ravens of the Mountain or something arghthisgameiscomplicated...])\n\nEdited September 16, 2015 by sappidus"}]}
