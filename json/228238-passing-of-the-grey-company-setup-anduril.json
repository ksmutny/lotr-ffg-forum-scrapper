The Saga rulebooks say you place the campaign card next to the quest deck (and then follow the setup instructions), which won't be on the table until after you've drawn your setup hand. I don't think you'd lose Andúril to a mulligan."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228238-passing-of-the-grey-company-setup-anduril/?do=findComment&comment=2377728","commentId":2377728,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1471820089,"content":"Agreed. Step 5 of the set-up is drawing your hand, including a potential mulligan. Step 6 is setting the quest/campaign Cards (so you shouldn't even know about the possibility of getting Anduril when faced with the Mulligan Option, therefore I see know reason why it should get shuffeld back) and Step 7 following the setup instructions."}]}
