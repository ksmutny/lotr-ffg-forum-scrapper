Also the travel effects in the Dwarrodelf cycle are less painful than Mirkwood's."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67887-a-west-road-well-travelled/?do=findComment&comment=662766","commentId":662766,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1343094194,"content":"Though some locations are a pain to have active. Like the dreadfull gap location (can´t remember if that´s the correct name) that has a value of X as it´s progression value, where X is the number of characters in play and it automatically becomes the active location when revealed. By switching it with another you could potentially rid yourself of having to place 10+ progress tokens in exchange for it´s meager 2 threat value. Quite a relief in a location heavy scenario"}]}
