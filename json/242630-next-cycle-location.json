The only locations I feel are left that haven't been explored are Hobbiton (which aside from the Scouring of the Shire, I can't see), The Iron Hills (I also can't see because it'd be too similar to Khazad Dhum), Rhun (would be cool to see what they'd do with that), and...Mordor.\n\nNow I know Mordor is the Land of Shadow and no one would go venturing in there without a GOOD reason, but I feel like that could open up a whole new way to play LOTR! Like what Cataclysm did for Warhammer: Invasion. Maybe somehow throw in some PvP or something to represent the shadow overcoming friendship and cooperation.\n\nAnyway, just a thought. What do you guys think the next cycle will bring?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242630-next-cycle-location/?do=findComment&comment=2640747","commentId":2640747,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1487118630,"content":"My guess would be Northern Rhovanion with Erebor/Dale as the settled places and the Withered Heath for a more wild setting (it's also the perfect place for dragon and drake enemies). There's also the Ice Bay of Forochel and Khand.

Northern Rhovanion/Erebor/Dale/Withered Heath would also give the designers the opportunity to come full circle and to flesh out the Dale keyword (for which there are few cards in the game).

There's an entire group of people, the Lossoth, about whom we knew the same amount as we knew about the Dunlendings, yet we got an entire cycle around them. Same with the Haradrim. Forochel connects to the Iron Mountains, so if we have another cycle to the east in Rhovanion and Dale, we could have another cycle trekking along the Iron Mountains towards Forochel in search of the sunken Palantiri, and possibly run into some remnants of Morgoth's Balrogs near the ruins of Utumno."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/242630-next-cycle-location/?do=findComment&comment=2643951","commentId":2643951,"userName":"Willange","timestamp":1487272773,"content":"Well I suppose you all have good points... maybe it's just that I really don't want another whole cycle based on next to nothing...
