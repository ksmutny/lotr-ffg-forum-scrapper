To be clear, each paid attendee at the 2014 Fog on the Barrow Downs Fellowship Event received the following:\n\n1 copy of the Fog on the Barrow Downs quest\n\n1 copy of the alternate art Aragorn card (this came enclosed with the Fog on the Barrow Downs quest)\n\n1 copy of the Black Riders-themed playmat.\n\nRegarding playstyle - The 2015 Fellowship Event wil almost certainly be a cooperative experience, wherein groups of players work together to make their way through the quest, unless FFG has made a significant change from 2014. The 2014 Fellowship event was entirely cooperative. There were no competitive events and the store kit materials were distributed to all participants. Players did not have to earn the quest, the alt art card, or the playmat through some sort of competitive system. They simply received all three items by paying the registration fee and attending the event. I could be wrong, but it seems quite unlikely FFG will shift away from this system, especially for a cooperative game.\n\nI urge folks who might be new to the game to reach out to FFG and your fellow players in the community if you have question about the 2015 Fellowship Event. Many of us here on the forums played in last year's Fellowship Event and should be able to help with questions. And I'm sure FFG would happily answer your questions, too. It's possible things will be different from last year, but given the game's cooperative format, this seems unlikely.\n\nEdited August 25, 2015 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175303-lotr-lcg-playmat/?do=findComment&comment=1753929","commentId":1753929,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1440505694,"content":"Thats awesome and apologies for me getting it wrong.\n\nOh yes and I know its co-op but those threads discussing best scores etc do seem to imply there can be a certain aspect of competition applied if needed :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nVery glad i was wrong on this, all sounds an excellent package!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175303-lotr-lcg-playmat/?do=findComment&comment=1754195","commentId":1754195,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1440513346,"content":"Being at Gen Con this year, it was awesome seeing 8 (yes 8!) playmats for AGOT second edition on sale (I picked up 2), one for each house.

Whether or not they think it's worth the time and effort is another matter, I suppose."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175303-lotr-lcg-playmat/?do=findComment&comment=1754511","commentId":1754511,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1440519911,"content":"I would think that FFG must at least be considering sellingLOTR playmats, as the game seems to be doing quite well for them. A cursory glance at the numbers for the Living Card Game forums shows that Lord of the Rings has the 2nd most topics (AGOT is first) and has the most replies to topics (AGOT is 2nd) by a pretty wide margin. Obviously, this isn't any sort of detailed statistical analysis, but on the surface it sure seems like LOTR is a solid revenue stream for them. I think the fact that they are doing a 2nd Fellowship Event in 2015 also shows the game is doing well. So yeah, hopefully we might see playmats for sale in the future.\n\n \n\nQuick note on my aforementioned post on the play-style of the Fellowship Event. I should clarify that while the 2014 FE wasn't promoted as a competitive event its entirely possible that players at last year's event may have played in a competitive style. This didn't happen at our event in the Washington D.C. area, but I can't speak about other locations. And folks could certainly elect to do so this year, too. I was just trying to clarify that the swag is given to everyone who pays and shows up. You don't have to win it. The registration cost for our Fellowship Event last year was $20. Hopefully its about the same this year.\n\nEdited August 25, 2015 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175303-lotr-lcg-playmat/?do=findComment&comment=1754547","commentId":1754547,"userName":"raven614","timestamp":1440520829,"content":"Anyone know of an event in Indiana I've checked two local stores in Indianapolis and there not having it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175303-lotr-lcg-playmat/?do=findComment&comment=1761038","commentId":1761038,"userName":"reaper829","timestamp":1440783504,"content":"> Theres a double sized two player mat on BGG somewhere (sorry on tablet so not easy to go check) which is truly stunning.
