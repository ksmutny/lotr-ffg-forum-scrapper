I really love his work. \n\nAnother one would be Tomasz Jedruszek. He's done card artwork for AGOT Lcg, so it's a possibility that we see him working in this game too (PLEASE FFG) He's the one who did the art you see in the first player token, and in the Khazad Dum box, and in the Middle Earth Quest box. I think we'll see more of his art in this game, hopefully on cards. \n\nThere are others, that I just can't remember but I will mention later.
