I have no idea why the Rules Reference says that. No, there's nothing you're missing, but a correction needs to be made to the reference. I can only say I'm positive an enemy that makes an immediate attack still attacks the engaged player in the combat phase. I'll send a rules question."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293080-immediate-attack/?do=findComment&comment=3664848","commentId":3664848,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1554136534,"content":"I agree that this must be an RR wording error.

All enemies that are engaged with the players attack each round, and the players resolve those attacks one at a time.\n\n…and trying to reconcile this with the FAQ entry on enemies changing engagement…\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Q: When an enemy that has already made an attack engages a new player during the combat phase, does it make another attack?\n> A: Not unless it is directed to by card effect\n\n…they threw the new verbiage in to try to cover the FAQ ruling within the new rules.
