Question: In the end of commiting charecters steap in the Quest phase, can I play \"Sneak Attack\" on \"Gandalf\" in my hand. After putting Gandalf in the play, If I am right, I can also deal 4 damage to the Hill Troll, even if hi is in the staging area?\n\nAnd in the end of the Quest phase according to the Sneak Attack card I put Gandalf back in my hand??? (because it isn't yet end of the round...)\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58585-game-situation/?do=findComment&comment=575979","commentId":575979,"userName":"MADG0BLIN2","timestamp":1325938548,"content":"You are correct I think.
