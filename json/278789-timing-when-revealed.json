That for I need some clarification. What happens if Gandalf (hero or ally) is in play and an enemy called Gandalf gets reveald? Will the when reveald effect occur before discarding that card (because there is allready an unique card called Gandalf in play)? I hope so, otherwise my mission wont work.\n\nGandalf-Front-Face.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_07/Gandalf-Front-Face.jpg.5b2b5d22d9b5142f5ebfa0b5440f5825.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_07/Gandalf-Front-Face.jpg.5b2b5d22d9b5142f5ebfa0b5440f5825.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278789-timing-when-revealed/?do=findComment&comment=3395385","commentId":3395385,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1530807362,"content":"A unique card can't be played and can't enter play if another one is already in play.\n\nEncounter deck does not play any card (they are revealed or put in play, but no one never play them), so the only problematic part would be the \"enter play\".
