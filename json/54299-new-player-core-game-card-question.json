The card count is accurate. However, I have 4 Gandalf cards. The rule book implies 1 Gandalf card, but I see deck builds showing 3 Gandalf cards but never 4. How many Gandalf cards should I have? Is there anywhere that shows what exact cards come in the core game? If 4 Gandalf cards is one too many, then I must be missing another card.\n\nThanks for any info."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54299-new-player-core-game-card-question/?do=findComment&comment=537983","commentId":537983,"userName":"Eyedunno53","timestamp":1317903330,"content":"You are supposed to have four.  One for each of the starter decks.  But, when you want to modify decks and build your own, you are allowed to have up to three of any card in it.  Thus why decks include that many."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54299-new-player-core-game-card-question/?do=findComment&comment=537985","commentId":537985,"userName":"stormbringer4","timestamp":1317903482,"content":"Thanks for your quick response."}]}
