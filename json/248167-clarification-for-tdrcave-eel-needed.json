The first where the players optionally can engage enemys and the later where engagement checks are made. But from the wording in the rule book I'd say both are \"engagements\". So, that eel with its cost of 20 cannot be engaged (under any circumstances) unless your location is underwater?! (Even with e.g. tactics Aragorn.) Anyhow, the wording on the card itself sounds \"pretty active\" - so no optional engagements, but \"passive like engagements\" in the latter part of the engagement phase will still force the engagement?? Which one is it?\n\nHelp please!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248167-clarification-for-tdrcave-eel-needed/?do=findComment&comment=2752787","commentId":2752787,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1493150348,"content":"No optional engagements, no card-ability engagements, no checked engagements unless the active location is Underwater."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248167-clarification-for-tdrcave-eel-needed/?do=findComment&comment=2753173","commentId":2753173,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1493160246,"content":"I agree with Kakita. \"cannot\" is a very strong word that tends to defy all avenues and bypasses.\n\nI read this card as meaning the Cave Eel can't experience the act of engagement, but can still experience the state of engagement.\n\nAnd I think the Dunedain hunter could probably still engage it since that card puts the Eel into play engaged with you from the deck and the Eel's text isn't active until it gets into play (much the way you can resurrect a dead Beorn, even though he is immune to player cards).\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/248167-clarification-for-tdrcave-eel-needed/?do=findComment&comment=2753193","commentId":2753193,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1493160804,"content":"> 8 minutes ago, RichardPlunkett said:\n> \n> And I think the Dunedain hunter could probably still engage it since that card puts the Eel into play engaged with you from the deck and the Eel's text isn't active until it gets into play.\n> \n>  \n\nTrue, I forgot about this.

What will happen then is the 1st hypothesis i mention below.\n\n \n\n \n\nSecond situation:\n\n \"Forced: At the beginning of the encounter phase, return Cave Eel to the staging area unless the active location is Underwater.\"\n\nThis forced effect only triggers at the beggining of the encounter phase.\n\nSo it arises two different situations:\n\n1 - In the beggining of the encounter phase, there is no active location or the active location isn't underwater, if Cave Eel is engaged with any player, it immediately returns to the stagging area;\n\n \n\n2 - If, by any means (ex: Legolas [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Legolas-Core]' response in combat phase), after the beggining of encounter phase,  you clear the active underwater location, then Cave Eel forced effect doesn't trigger and thus Cave Eel remains engaged with the player.\n\nAfter this, if Cave Eel isn't killed, then hypothesis 1 will occur...\n\n \n\n \n\nThis is what i think of what is written in Cave Eel text.\n\n \n\n \n\nCarlos José Matos"}]}
