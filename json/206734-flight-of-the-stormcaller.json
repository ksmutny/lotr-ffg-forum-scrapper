I've never seen anything this long on the boat with FFG (I don't check it that often though) and I thought the AP's were supposed to be released shortly after the Deluxe expansion.\n\n \n\nMy local FLGS had it slated for a February release.\n\n \n\nWhat's going on? I'm quite curious."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206734-flight-of-the-stormcaller/?do=findComment&comment=2124287","commentId":2124287,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1458908514,"content":"Salting the wound, are we?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206734-flight-of-the-stormcaller/?do=findComment&comment=2124329","commentId":2124329,"userName":"Sorcerious","timestamp":1458911208,"content":"> Salting the wound, are we?\n\n \n\nThat's what i do ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206734-flight-of-the-stormcaller/?do=findComment&comment=2124371","commentId":2124371,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1458912643,"content":"Captain Sahir must have gotten to that ship first."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206734-flight-of-the-stormcaller/?do=findComment&comment=2124698","commentId":2124698,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1458922939,"content":"He hasn't become an ally just yet it seems!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206734-flight-of-the-stormcaller/?do=findComment&comment=2124977","commentId":2124977,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1458930505,"content":"Sadly, elven ships sail slower than the Greyjoy's can row.

It has been weather, dock strikes, and customs before. Customs can be a real pain because the whole boat can be held back for a container that ffg had nothing to do with.\n\nIt seems to be shipping with lots of reprints, too.

There is a new season of GoT starting soon, but no new Tolkien media (likely ever). I mean, it sure stinks, but the wide attention given to GoT and Star Wars in the mainstream means it makes economic sense to focus on those lines (especially since GoT recent second edition makes it a much cheaper game to dive into right away).\n\nLuckily for me I just discovered LOTR LCG, so I have a long way to go before I'm chomping at the bit for new stuff. However, as a former diskwars and current WHQ player, I feel your pain."}]}
