Starting with the 1st player.\n3) If one player fails the threat checks all monsters that fail go to him.\n4) If 2 or more players fail the threat check the monsters force engaged the players in turn order. For example if you are playing a 2 player game and both players fail a monster check on 3 monsters, then the highest threat monster will force engage player 1, 2nd highest player 2, 3rd highest player 1 again.\n\nHope this helps. Threat management is one of the most important things in the game. CotC is a super easy quest once you build a threat management deck. Try to make sure your starting threat is around 26ish.\n\n------EDIT\n\nOh. and in the above example, if 2 of the monsters have a tied threat stat, the engagements happen exactly the same way but teh 1st player gets to pick witch monster engages first."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57001-engagement-check-doubt/?do=findComment&comment=562441","commentId":562441,"userName":"Untergeher","timestamp":1322725604,"content":"Yeah, all the trolls engage you in the same turn. That's the reason why it's so important to keep your threat low during this quest. Once you have enough allies and support out you can take out one troll after the other. But if your threat is 34 or higher when you reach that step of the quest and you're not prepared, well then you're in a lot of trouble..."}]}
