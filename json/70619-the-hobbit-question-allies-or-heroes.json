I started wondering when I should attach a sack to the ally with the most resources. Doesn't make much sense when Radagast ist the only ally who is able to gather resources (the card text forced me to check again if the new Bilbo is considered as a hero or as an ally).\n\n \n\nOk, at least now it makes more sense.

I was already wondering why everyone complained about the high difficulty of quest 1. Played it now with the correct rules (only one character attacking the troll, sacks being attached to characters instead of allies) and I almost lost. Managed to win with my threat at 42 because the encounter deck was empty. Defeated Bert after some rounds (with Grave Cairn and Durin's Song on Ori), and was fighting Tom. I think I made a few rule mistakes so the win wasn't valid, but still the game feels much better now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70619-the-hobbit-question-allies-or-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=690118","commentId":690118,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1347123678,"content":"I sent a mail to FFG's customer service to make them aware of the problem.

If you dont need them so you just keep your threat low, engage the first troll and quest with maximum power to discard encounter deck cards. When encounter deck is empty you win. Really not a big deal. But if you want to get treasures different story. Is really hard until you get lucky.
