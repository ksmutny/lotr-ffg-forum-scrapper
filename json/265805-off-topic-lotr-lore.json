When I need any lore information I go to a french encyclopedia ( http://www.tolkiendil.com/bienvenue [http://www.tolkiendil.com/bienvenue]) or ask to friends of mine who know perfectly the books ^^.\n\nWe will have a Scouring of the Shire POD someday, but it will probably be fan-made since there is no sign of FFG."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265805-off-topic-lotr-lore/?do=findComment&comment=3140264","commentId":3140264,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1513998604,"content":"I would add the source books for The One Ring RPG by Cubicle 7. These books do an awesome job of detailing out what we know about specific parts of Middle-earth and they're not afraid to pencil in the details. They're also beautifully illustrated, which is a big plus."}]}
