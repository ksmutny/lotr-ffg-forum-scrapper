So either the encounter cards need a new Attachment card type, or it needs to transform from a Treachery to an Attachment, as it currently does. If we give them an attachment card type, then Eleanor doesn't work to stop them because she explicitly targets treacheries. I totally understand the disgust for the long complicated card text of transforming a Treachery to an attachment, but I like keeping the number of card types small, too. I could go either way.\n\nEdited February 24, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99975-is-it-just-me-or/?do=findComment&comment=994452","commentId":994452,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1393265581,"content":"danpoage, my complaint is about clearness of card text.

Just because they've done it from the beginning, doesn't mean it's an attachment. I guess you might mean that you could have the cards (like Miner of the Iron Hills) say \"choose and discard 1 Condition card from play.\" instead of specifying attachment, but mechanically, it seems better that cards that get attached should be attachments.\n\n \n\nMy point is that they should either go beyond what you are doing and make the encounter cards be of the attachment type - instead of transforming from a treachery to an attachment - or do what they are already doing.

As simple as that. \n\n \n\nTo put it more simple: Treachery Attachment card is considered a Treachery all times except while it's attached to something.
