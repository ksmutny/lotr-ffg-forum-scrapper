He went only once to get the ship to Valinor, from Grey Havens probably.\n\nWell, that depends on which history of Celeborn you adhere to. His history went through several revisions by Tolkien, which can be found in the Unfinished Tales. An argument could be made to go with the last version of Celeborn's history that Tolkien wrote before he died, which made Celeborn one of the Teleri (the \"elves of the sea\" and the \"ship-wrights\"), and had him meet Galadriel in Aqualonde in Valinor, before sailing to Beleriand with her and the Noldor. \n\nThe chapter in the Unfinished Tales is very hard to follow and hard to find online, so here's the summary from Tolkien Gateway:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> According to an alternate history of Celeborn and Galadriel in Unfinished Tales, Celeborn was a Teler of noble rank in Alqualondë, born Teleporno, grandson of Olwë, King of the Falmari.\n> \n> Artanis, Olwë's granddaughter and a Noldorin princess of great beauty, often spent long visits to Alqualondë and her mother’s kin. During this time the two fell in love, and Teleporno gave her the romantic epithet Alatáriel, meaning \"Maiden Crowned with Radiant Garland\". Teleporno's name gained an additional Quenya form, Telporno (pron. [telˈporno]).\n> \n> Later, Teleporno and Artanis helped to defend Alqualondë from the Noldor during the First Kinslaying. Nevertheless, Artanis’s heart was fired by the stories of Fëanor of the open lands across the sea. She urged Teleporno to take a ship eastward to Endor, and he gave in. In doing so the two fell under the Ban of the Valar.\n> \n> In Beleriand, Teleporno and Artanis were greeted by Elu Thingol, High King of the Sindar and Lord of Doriath. Teleporno eventually Sindarinized his name to Celeborn; Artanis Sindarinized the epithet Celeborn had given her, and Alatáriel became Galadriel.\n\nNow given that FFG gave Celeborn the Silvan trait it's evident that that they are going by the more widely published version of Celeborn's history in the Silmarillion. But I'll take my Celeborn with a ship in the background please, just so that I can 1-up the other Tolkien nerds :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249745-gencon-50-attack-on-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=2943342","commentId":2943342,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1503410236,"content":"> 16 hours ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> Well, that depends on which history of Celeborn you adhere to.

It was really hard, as usual for a GenCon quest. The other table didn't make it more than a half hour in, while our table folded as soon as we reached Stage 3. I haven't had a chance to try it solo yet.\n\nMechanical spoilers ahead!\n\nIt's in many ways similar to Siege of Annuminas, but in reverse. Instead of trying to keep the city at full health, you're the ones doing the damage to the city whenever you destroy Enemies or explore Locations. (The exact amount is listed on the Enemies and Locations themselves, in the spot where victory points usually are). Like in Annuminas you get a couple of rounds to set up before the bad stuff starts to happen in full force.\n\nThe game \"proper\" starts when you reach Stage 3, of which there are 4 different options. Each team has to pick a different option, and at the start of each round you get a chance to switch it up. Each Stage 3 has a different Lieutenant Enemy, a bad effect that hurts each team if you don't place at least 5 progress on it, and a good effect that helps each team if you place at least 10 progress on it. Whichever Stage nobody picked ends up doing its bad stuff to everyone, so there are a lot of things to consider when picking a Stage. I wish we had managed to survive longer, since it would have been really fun to see how this part played out over several rounds.\n\nThere were some really tough Enemies, but there were also a bunch of nasty Locations that couldn't get traveled to or have progress placed on them unless you were at a specific Stage 3. There were a lot of them, and they just clogged up the Staging Area and made it really difficult to make progress. I think we would have had an easier time if our table had a little more willpower and a little less focus on combat. We basically just had one dedicated questing deck, with everyone else contributing a little here and there--and that didn't seem to be enough.\n\nDid anyone who went to GenCon actually manage to beat it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249745-gencon-50-attack-on-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=2944506","commentId":2944506,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1503437300,"content":"> 2 hours ago, Authraw said:\n> \n> Did anyone who went to GenCon actually manage to beat it?\n\nNo, but Caleb said my Sunday table made the about the same headway as the best table (about 12 damage to the city), but played the most total rounds before threating out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249745-gencon-50-attack-on-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=2949282","commentId":2949282,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1503612035,"content":"I just finished writing a blog post with a breakdown of this quest, complete with nice scans of the encounter cards, if anyone is interested:\n\nhttps://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/spoiler-alert-attack-on-dol-guldur/ [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/spoiler-alert-attack-on-dol-guldur/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/249745-gencon-50-attack-on-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=2950151","commentId":2950151,"userName":"farealh","timestamp":1503664727,"content":"> 14 hours ago, Authraw said:\n> \n> I just finished writing a blog post with a breakdown of this quest, complete with nice scans of the encounter cards, if anyone is interested:\n> \n> https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/spoiler-alert-attack-on-dol-guldur/ [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/2017/08/24/spoiler-alert-attack-on-dol-guldur/]\n\nThanks a lot for doing so!

Our little group had very little anti-treachery cards and when the time came we did not have any in hand.  In the subsequent fight phase, I was dealing with two creatures whom each received an extra attacks via treacheries which followed the third and final extra attack via another treachery (there were only three and I got all three in a row).
