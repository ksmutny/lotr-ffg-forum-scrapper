In other words, does the Bog count itself as a location in the staging area?\n> \n> A: Encounter cards are revealed from the encounter deck, their “When Revealed” effects are resolved, and the card is then placed in the staging area. So the Bog has not yet entered the staging area when its effects resolve.\n\nIt does not say if the card is in play or not, but, by the rules : \n\n\n\n> “In play” refers to cards that have been played or put into play (in a player’s play area), to cards that are waiting in the staging area, to the currently revealed quest card, and to encounter cards that are engaged with that player.\n\nSo I deduced the cards was not in play till it reaches the staging area...\n\nMaybe it was wrong from the official answer.\n\nEdited January 7, 2014 by alogos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96276-ring-and-witch-king/?do=findComment&comment=947969","commentId":947969,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1389112546,"content":"You can't use Thror's Key to immune locations, but because it reads: \"after a location is added...\"\n\n \n\nffg_thrors-key-otd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_thrors-key-otd.jpg]\n\n \n\nIt is not similar than Frodo and ring.
