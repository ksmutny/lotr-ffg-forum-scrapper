I was just looking at Denethor and wondering to swap him into the deck. I have Faramir, Aragon and Mirlonde. I was thinking of replacing Mirlonde as she keeps getting killed by nasty treachery cards wounding questing heroes, but her reduction of threat is nice.\n\n \n\nI'll give it a few more tries and see what happens.\n\n \n\nThanks again. So nice to have a community so helpful and speedy!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/171717-noob-question-objective-cards-as-shadow-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1581829","commentId":1581829,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1429487010,"content":"All of Your heroes is your sideboard.
