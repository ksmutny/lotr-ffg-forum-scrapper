I hope this thread can be used to list any problem areas and clarify what the intent of some of the not so obvious entries are trying to say.\n\nCase 1\n\n(1.22) \"When Revealed\" Effects\nExample: If the players use the Stage 3b \"Don't Leave the Path!\" (CORE 121) quest card effect to search for a Forest Spider and put it into play, the \"When Revealed\" effect on the Forest Spider will not trigger, since the effect on \"Don't Leave the Path!\" does not spcifically use a form of the word \"reveal\". \n\nForest Spider (Core 96) does not contain a \"When Revealed\" card effect. I assume that instead of a Forest Spider, the example should have used King Spider (Core 74) instead. Oh yes, and a typo \"specifically\" not \"spcifically\"\n\nCase 2\n\n(1.17) Unclaimed Objectives\nAn unclaimed objective is one that is not currently claimed and under the control of a player.\n\nThis would be much easier to understand if it said \"An unclaimed objective is one that is not under the control of a player.\" At the moment it is confusing since it seems to imply \"An unclaimed objective is one that is (not currently claimed) and (under the control of a player)\"  instead of \"An unclaimed objective is one that is not (currently claimed and under the control of a player).\"\n\nWhen I get time I shall check to see if there are further issues or obscurities. I hope others can add problems they see with the new FAQ.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49228-errors-in-faq-v11/?do=findComment&comment=492835","commentId":492835,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1309348517,"content":"Yes, 've just read that.
