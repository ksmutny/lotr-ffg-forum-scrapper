But I also think Elrond will be an ally while the other three mentioned (and not yet released) shall all be heroes.

While the Tolkien theme needs to be respected and paid homage to.. . I think they should have the freedom to stray around it.\n\nLike for example.. there are no Cyclops in Tolkiens stories.. but there is no reason why these can not fit into the fantasy world.. maybe he just nvr talked about it. Same with other creatures like griffins or w/e. Do we really want \"Troll Number 15\" or would we like tro see a new cool monster like says Cyclops or a cat person.\n\nThe game is only young and it is already repeating its self. How many times can they make packs with Orcs and trolls in it b4 we are all booored to death of it?\n\nIt is something they have to be careful with as you need to respect the theme.. but I see no problem with imagining stuff.. I mean Beravor for example is a fine example of a made up character that fit fine.\n\nLike we are already at 3 heroes and counter that are doubled up, and one player card is in the encounter decks as well so you can not use her in those quests. Now I see people talking as if this is a good thing.. but it isn't.. every time they make a new Hero that has the same name as an old one they are not ADDING to the game they are REPLACING as you can not use the new hero and the old hero at the same time. This is restricting deck building and basically making it so we buy a new pack but our card pool is not increasing.\n\nEach hero should be unique.\n\nrichsabre said:\n\nnot that any of tolkiens creations are 'bottom of the barrel' material- but you get my point\n\nwhat about Ghân-buri-Ghân?

And the game hasn't even begun to employ any of the traits they have created, there's no card for the already existing traits like Warrior, Ranger, Archer, Minstrel, Crafstman, Scout, Healer, let alone Noble or Steward (found on Denethor - I am much interested if that one ever sees some importance)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65851-i-am-predicting-we-will-get-a-tactics-eowyn-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=644968","commentId":644968,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1339753769,"content":"booored said:\n\nI really want to see a Tactics Sam… I think this will come in the hobbit decks or maybe as the last Hero in Darodelf.\n\nWe have Lore and Spirit Hobbits and while we are missing a leadership hobbit, (who i would have probably done as frodo) I think a tactics hobbit is the real missing part to make a full hobbit hero deck. Sam becomes a full warrior by the end of the stories and basicly storms a evil castle by himself at once stage.. so him being tactics fits really well in the story as well..\n\n\n\nThematically I think that either Pippin or Merry could make sense as Leadership hobbits at some point. I am thinking of the later parts of TLOTR, once they have had the experience of serving Denethor/Theoden and of fighting in the big battles - when they return to the Shire, they are both perceived as lordly/princely figures, and it is them (not Frodo who stays in the background) who organise the successful resistance to Saruman's forces in the scouring of the shire."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65851-i-am-predicting-we-will-get-a-tactics-eowyn-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=645032","commentId":645032,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1339761086,"content":"i believe that we may see again 2 versions of merry and pippin - pre Return of the King and post RTK, as i think they are two of the most changed characters in the year (and a day?) that it took to go to mordor and back"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65851-i-am-predicting-we-will-get-a-tactics-eowyn-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=645141","commentId":645141,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1339779433,"content":" yes, THAT I can live with… so you're assuming that this LCG will in fact cover the \"book\" part of LOTR? i.e. the war of the ring? that would actually be great to play as a team in a HUGE campaign start from the shire, pass the misty mountains, lorien, the anduin, etc…. all the way to mordor :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nI could imagine wiser and older and mightier versions of the hobbits or other characters… but as this game was originally supposed to cover the 17 years \"inbetween\"… well… so far, so good, I can't complain! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65851-i-am-predicting-we-will-get-a-tactics-eowyn-some-day/?do=findComment&comment=645168","commentId":645168,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1339784720,"content":"well from the start of the game there was much talk on the 'limitations' and that they were from the years of the end of the hobbit until around the long expected party - we now know this not to be true with the hobbit box set- so i guess its possible"}]}
