The Progression Series, how it began, was a great idea and a great experience. The fist videos have been a lot of fun, Mitch & Matthew discussed possible theories, fears and rule questions. But the more and more the time proceeded, the videos got extremely matter-of-fact. Where are the emotions, where is what I experience every day when I play LOTR with my friend?\n\nMitch cut out every discussion, every other problem or mistake or correcting of it they made was cut out. As a result what remained was an extremely boring video, very strict, a little bit like \"we have to win it by any means, we cant do mistakes\". From what I heared in over 50 episodes of Progression Series Mitch comes to me as a person who has a great \"Ego\", which makes it also difficult to identify with the host. Many times Matthew suffered by no card draw, poor ressources, while Mitch was a wealthy man and almost never came to the idea to share his ressources or card draw ability with Matthew. Absolutely logical suggestions of Matthew are usually answered with a \"well, lets see\".\n\nHonestly Matthew, I dont know, why you let yourself control so much. At least in the Player card reviews you are allowed to have an own opinion.\n\nTo put it in a nutshell: I am sad not to hear or see anything more of Mattew, but sad that Mitch has gone? Not really."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89180-mitch-gone/?do=findComment&comment=849895","commentId":849895,"userName":"tomtom","timestamp":1377453664,"content":"Strongly disagree with the overfreudian opinion about Progression Series above.

I remember some of the first times where the play throughs where more natural. Then somebody really went \"HEY, YOU DID THIS AND THIS WRONG!!! ARE YOU STOPID OR SOMETHING????\" and stuff like that. Perfectly constructive critique but said in various destructive ways. So after a couple of these events I can understand that he/they went over in the opposite ditch. \"Okay, if it isn't allowed to make a mistake or two to tick off people then we might better talk things through and be sure not to make mistakes\". Now, when he did THAT it suddenly was \"Buh, boring games\" and \"You explain too much\". Of cause they explain it, that's what you do when you record something and need to make sure people follows. And by the way, he doesn't really explain as much as thinking out loud. Again which you need to do due to the vile comments they got in the beginning. But overall, I only know a handful people on the various forum that think they are boring. Everyone else loves them.\n\nOh, and to you Glaurung, they have done far more for this game than you have ever done or will do. Why? Because they reach out to all over the whole world. Not just their local gaming group or community. But most important of all, they include all that wanna be included.
