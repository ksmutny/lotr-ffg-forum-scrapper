In the pulldown to the right of Allow Blog Feeds, choose full or short. That's it.\"\n\n \n\nRSS feeds allow other sites to know when you have updated you site with a new post, and also allows them to read your content without actually being on your site. I want it for a feed aggregator, which pulls all the content from all the blogs I follow into one place so I know when there are new articles and can read them without needing to go to each of the sites.\n\nEdited February 7, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98645-newly-developing-lotr-lcg-blog/?do=findComment&comment=977465","commentId":977465,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1391808185,"content":"Thanks!  I toggled that setting to select for a full RSS feed of my site.  I'm definitely going to look more into these now because they sound quite handy indeed.  "}]}
