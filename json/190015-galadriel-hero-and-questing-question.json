I've search in the forum before asking this but could not find an answer (neither in the FAQ).\n\n \n\nSo I'd like to know : with Nenya, when doing the ''Quest Action: Exhaust Nenya and Galadriel to add her [Willpower] to another character’s [Willpower] until the end of the phase', is Galadriel considered committed to the quest or not? Because she adds her willpower to another character, she doesn't give it, and she is exhausted.\n\n \n\nI think that se his, but it could be the opposite.  ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png] \n\nEdited September 30, 2015 by Lecitadin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190015-galadriel-hero-and-questing-question/?do=findComment&comment=1827662","commentId":1827662,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1443645775,"content":"Galadriel cannot commit to a quest. Any effect that targets characters committed to the quest would not target her, however any effects that target exhausted characters would(provided you don't have a readying effect like unexpected courage)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190015-galadriel-hero-and-questing-question/?do=findComment&comment=1827687","commentId":1827687,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1443646673,"content":"Ah!
