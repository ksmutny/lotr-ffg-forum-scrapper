I haven't bought any yet but think I will soon.\n\nThere is a very specific answer to the way you asked this question.\n\nIt's the only quest that gets far less \"annoying randomness\" as you put it, and that's The Dead Marshes. Gollum does not get discarded, but shuffled back into the deck.\n\nIf you want my advice on the ones to pick up:\n\n-passage through mirkwood (makes the quest interesting again, so worth your money)\n\n-hills of emyn muil (same)\n\n-the dead marshes (reason given above)\n\nMind you, NM is not for sissies...you will die, many times ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nEdited May 16, 2014 by Noccus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106417-does-nightmare-fix-some-quests/?do=findComment&comment=1087519","commentId":1087519,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1400274087,"content":"To give a contrarian opinion on Dead Marshes, there are now escape test cards with 5s and 10s in the deck.  And given the primary constraint on the Nightmare setup card if you pull one or two of those on the final escape test you have usually failed.  Regarding Gollum not going into the discard pile, I would rather he did because Shadow of the Past is still a legal card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106417-does-nightmare-fix-some-quests/?do=findComment&comment=1087630","commentId":1087630,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1400280272,"content":"Contrarian? I don't see any contradiction here.\n\nZanzibar here asked for \"annoying randomness\" and that's gone as I stated, and you too.\n\nHe did not ask for difficulty, and again you and I stated NM is hard, albeit in different forms.\n\nSo what I'm reading is that you agree with my post my friend! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n(I should be a politician)\n\nEdited May 16, 2014 by Noccus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106417-does-nightmare-fix-some-quests/?do=findComment&comment=1087709","commentId":1087709,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1400285185,"content":"Sounds good guys, thanks.\n\nSo Mirkwood, Emyn Muil and Dead marshes, any other person favourites anyone has?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106417-does-nightmare-fix-some-quests/?do=findComment&comment=1087864","commentId":1087864,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1400301474,"content":"Hunt for Gollum is really good.
