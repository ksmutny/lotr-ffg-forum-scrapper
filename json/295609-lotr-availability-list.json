Since there are posts all over the community where people are looking for specific expansions, I decided to make a list out of it. You can find that list here: https://docs.google.com/…/1jEB-tGlr21kKTt7QnffQ8kdxbd…/edit… [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jEB-tGlr21kKTt7QnffQ8kdxbdNVabZgZqgKf50bRwE/edit?usp=sharing&fbclid=IwAR1lb0DArwyT0RVONYH8cQzfIZIngXQNEtVX0XAYxAWDzLXjiaAl1TVS_ug]\n\nOn this list, you can find if the product is available via FFG, how the community regards its availability and a list of URLs to shops that sell that expansion.\n\nI also need your input for this list. If you have an expansion for sale, then you can add it to the list. If a link has expired or there is no more available via that link, please delete it. If you find another shop that sells it, add the link to the list.\n\nTo international players, please specify the country of origin, and if you are willing to buy the pack and ship it to the buyer if there is no international shipping via the shop.\nEnglish expansions only, for now. If you want to make a tab for French, German, Spanish, or Polish translated versions, please add them in a separate tab below.\n\nI hope people will step up to keep this updated frequently because I also have a blog to maintain and can't be asked to do both on top of my graduation assignment. I hope this got the ball rolling!\n\nEdited May 24, 2019 by Durins_Father"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295609-lotr-availability-list/?do=findComment&comment=3708104","commentId":3708104,"userName":"IAmTheSmitty","timestamp":1558702767,"content":"Good Morning,\n\n     Thank you for creating this.  I really feel this will help with finding some of the harder-to-find items.  \n\nSmitty"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295609-lotr-availability-list/?do=findComment&comment=3708124","commentId":3708124,"userName":"LordBird","timestamp":1558705587,"content":"Dwarrowdelf Cycle Adventure Packs:  As of today, 4 of the 6 are still available here\n\nhttps://imaginaire.com/en/catalogsearch/result.html?page=2&q=lord+of+the+rings+the+card+game [https://imaginaire.com/en/catalogsearch/result.html?page=2&q=lord+of+the+rings+the+card+game]\n\nOnly The Long dark and Watcher in The Water are out of stock.\n\nEdited May 24, 2019 by LordBird\nchanged french link to english one"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295609-lotr-availability-list/?do=findComment&comment=3708137","commentId":3708137,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1558706121,"content":"> 8 minutes ago, LordBird said:\n> \n> Only The Long dark and Watcher in The Water are out of stock.\n\nI think most people are fine with one of those! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295609-lotr-availability-list/?do=findComment&comment=3708154","commentId":3708154,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1558707528,"content":"> 31 minutes ago, LordBird said:\n> \n> Dwarrowdelf Cycle Adventure Packs:  As of today, 4 of the 6 are still available here\n> \n> https://imaginaire.com/en/catalogsearch/result.html?page=2&q=lord+of+the+rings+the+card+game [https://imaginaire.com/en/catalogsearch/result.html?page=2&q=lord+of+the+rings+the+card+game]\n> \n> Only The Long dark and Watcher in The Water are out of stock.\n\nGood to hear, people are still looking for some of those packs.
