One important thing to know is that to play any of these expansions you need at least on Core Set (max three) or the Limited Edition Collector's two-player Starter Set. Hope that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281805-the-oathbreakers/?do=findComment&comment=3455601","commentId":3455601,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1535643401,"content":"> 38 minutes ago, CEOWolf said:\n> \n> Are there any campaigns that bother with the Dead Men of Dunharrow/The Oathbreakers?

There are 2 entire cycles, however, that deal with the Undead. Both Angmar Awakened cycle and the Grey Havens cycle have several quests featuring ghosties and ghoulies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281805-the-oathbreakers/?do=findComment&comment=3455641","commentId":3455641,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1535645774,"content":"The Stone of Erech in particular is a classic (one of the best scenarios ever IMO). Well worth purchasing."}]}
