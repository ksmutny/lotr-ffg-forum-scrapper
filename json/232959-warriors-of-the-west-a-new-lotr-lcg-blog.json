I have started a blog for this wonderful game. Mainly just doing turn by turn reports on quests I attempt and reviews on Nightmare quests at the moment but will add other types of content at a later date. Check it out and don't hesitate to let me know what you think or if I made any errors during one of my games/reports. \n\nThe next quest I am going to try and do a turn by turn report for will be Raid on the Grey Havens. I am expecting Nightmare The Lost Realm to arrive in the post in the next week or so and will be doing reviews of these Nightmare quests when I can as well. \n\nhttps://warriorsofthewestblog.wordpress.com/ [https://warriorsofthewestblog.wordpress.com/]\n\nEdited October 21, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232959-warriors-of-the-west-a-new-lotr-lcg-blog/?do=findComment&comment=2468295","commentId":2468295,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1477040275,"content":"More ressources about the game are always nice.

After a very careful look at what my situation and board state was at that point in the game however I have identified how I would have played and won had I not made the mistake and not a single extra shadow card, attack or encounter card is revealed in this alternative victory so it would have been 100% guaranteed.
