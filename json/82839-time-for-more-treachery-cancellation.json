I think for a better balanced quest, it is better when this keyword is rather rare, otherwise the luck factor steps in big time.\n\nWhen revealed cancelation is key. There just isn't enough of that. Of course, we need not another card like A Test of Will, perhaps not even as direct but we need some. I had a post about the parallel development of when revealed and shadow cancelation. Whilst in the core set, these were represented 2 to 1 (Eleanor, A Test of Will vs. Hasty Stroke), now they are represented 2 to 6, if I count right, adding A Burning Brand, Dawn Take You All, Dunedain Watcher, Rider of the Mark and Balin to the latter group. I know some of those are not very efficient most of the time but certainly there are choices, more importantly there are choices from different spheres.\n\nI put myself into the group that wants each sphere feel different but access to when revealed cancelation should be in every sphere, I feel. It is good enough that spirit has a primary on threat reduction; being the only sphere cancelling when revealed, seems a bit too much of a superiority. Lore, perahps, can do without it because it has ways to avoided (with hopefully more encounter control coming) but other spheres need some too. Treacheries, after all, are one of three basic types of the encounter cards, it doesn't seem fair that three out of four spheres are basically helpless against them.\n\nI have high hope this problem will soon be solved, or being begun to be solved, specially as there's the push toward mono-sphere decks. I think Leadership could get allies that would discard to cancel (or prevent - which would bring more suspense, I feel) treacheries.\n\nComing a full circle, when revealed is only a part of a treachery mechanism, there's doom and surge, too (leaving aside forced effects for now). There's Elfhelm now that can deal with doomed, perhaps we could also see someone (or something) to deal with the pesky surge?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82839-time-for-more-treachery-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=788463","commentId":788463,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1366806662,"content":"I think we'll see some threachery cancellation for other spheres in the upcoming cycle…don't forget that monosphere decks are one of the main concern in AtS…so I bet there will be something. As for Ideas I always thought that a good trechery cancel for tactics would be like \"exhust a weapon attachment to cancel the effect of a treachery just reveald etc…\" or \"discard a tactics event from your hand to cancel the effect of a treachery card\" something like that…maybe cost 2 the first one and cost 1 the second…even though cancelling with tactics is a bit against my idea of this game…I've always seen each sphere as \"unable\" to do a particular thing…enabling them to do that particular thing would be like depriving them of their originality (for exemple healing for lore, \"real\" resource generation for leadership, high fighting stats and weapons for tactics, high willpower/low threat and cancel for spirit)..Also because when you build a deck you do it according to different aspects, if you build a lore/spirit deck then you'll be able to quest quickly and avoid most enemies with low threat and some e. deck control, if you build a tactics/leadership deck then you might want to fight through the quest, gainig victory points, boosting characters WP, Strenght and Defense, maybe doing more progress with legolas/blade of gondolin than you do by questing…obviously some scenarios are tough if you don't have one \"special feature\" (for exemple HoN is quite hardcore without tactics…or AJtR…which is almost completely random without lore, Return to Mirkwood impossible or almost without spirit ecc…)…\n\nSo I am positive about getting these kind of cards but not to the point where they would spoil the unique feel each sphere has."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82839-time-for-more-treachery-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=788472","commentId":788472,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1366808022,"content":"Of course, it is not easy to do it; and I believe when it's done it'll be done right.\n\nAs for the theme, I actually see Tactics being very fit to counter treachery - or avoid it somehow. When I first read about the spheres, the description about Tactics didn't sound like All Combat and Little of Anything Else, which it currently is. I really hope there will be no direct healing or high willpower for Tactics but having scouts that prevent a treachery card from revealing by doing something would be cool.\n\nI believe maintaing the spheres' flavour unique could easily be done the way it is for card draw at the moment; Lore gets the lot, others get little (but at least some for each). In a similar way, Tactics are obviously best at fighting but others can do quite a bit of that too, and Spirit, for instance, is getting quite a few combat oriented cards lately (Out of Sight, Light the Beacons, Blood of Númenor). Dealing with treacheries is in some quests almost as important as dealing with enemies or locations; and it is often that a few (if not one) when revealed effects can end the whole campaign, no matter how ambitious."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82839-time-for-more-treachery-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=788476","commentId":788476,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1366808928,"content":"I will pay a crazy amount of resources for an ally that cancels surge!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82839-time-for-more-treachery-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=788488","commentId":788488,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1366810488,"content":"thank you all for your repsonses, im pleased im not the only one who wants this. i also support the idea of cancellation for a cost…..pretty much what you have all stated is the same ideas as i have right now.\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82839-time-for-more-treachery-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=788615","commentId":788615,"userName":"nismojoe","timestamp":1366828165,"content":"You must exhaust a ready hero you control\n\nDiscard an ally you control\n\nexhaust at least 3 allies you control\n\ndisperse X amount of dmg among characters in play where X is 3x the number of players in the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82839-time-for-more-treachery-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=788628","commentId":788628,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1366829895,"content":"nismojoe said:\n\nYou must exhaust a ready hero you control\n\nDiscard an ally you control\n\nexhaust at least 3 allies you control\n\ndisperse X amount of dmg among characters in play where X is 3x the number of players in the game.\n\n\n\nagreed. something like these would be fine. i think we can all agree on the 'cancellation at a cost'….i wouldnt even mind if that cost was alot, just the choice would be a fine thing\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82839-time-for-more-treachery-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=788653","commentId":788653,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1366836610,"content":"Or partial cancellation effects.  Tactics event \"Bravely Fought,\" Response: deal 3 damage to one hero to ignore any threat-increasing \"when revealed\" effects of a card just revealed from the encounter deck.  Or the other way around, \"Cloven Shield\" event, Response: discard an Armour attachment and raise your threat by 3 to cancel any damage-dealing \"when revealed\" effects of a card just revealed from the encounter deck.\n\nSuch effect-targeting cards would work to increase your options for dealing with treachery, while avoiding the obvious problem of making it too easy to cancel whatever treachery comes up."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/82839-time-for-more-treachery-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=788655","commentId":788655,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1366837182,"content":"The problem with new cards for When-Revealed cancelation is that if it is better (or less costly) than A Test of Will, people will call out power creep and complain how you need to buy newest adventure packs to stay in game (which should be true since it is LCG, but that another topic), if it is not as good as (or more costly) than A Test of Will, people will (once again) point out how there isn't 3 copies of A Test of Will in the Core Set and reflame the old arguement.\n\nThe cost to cancel trechery must equal to a card and a spirit resource, or a hero exhausion.\n\nAlso the fact there are so many shadow cancellation out there now restricts options for When-Revealed cancellation.\nIf we were to see a 3 Cost Leadership ally that has ability to discard itself to cancel when-revealed effect, that's being generic and not creative at all. So there is need to spice things a bit. (change sphere? cost? extra restriction? additional ability? I don't know)\n\nBut from what I've seen in the Hobbit expansions and HoN delux expansion, I have every faith Caleb will do an excellent job (unless he already did excellent job and our new when-revealed cancellation cards are printing as we type)"}]}
