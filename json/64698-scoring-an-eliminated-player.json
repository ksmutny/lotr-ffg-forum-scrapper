Our playgroup likes to keep scores of our adventures, but we weren't sure how to score this situation.\n\nDoes an eliminated player (for whatever reason) receive 50 for threat + ## for sum of their heroes threat values + 0 for damage on heroes?\n\n \n\nThanks in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64698-scoring-an-eliminated-player/?do=findComment&comment=632279","commentId":632279,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1337246293,"content":" Yes, that's exactly how you do it."}]}
