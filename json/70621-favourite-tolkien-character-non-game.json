Sending the One Ring to Mordor in a hand of halfing sounds like perfectly fine idea.\n\nEven though Gandalf wouldn't share how he intends on entering Mordor, not even to Frodo or Aragorn(as a result he has no idea where to go after Gandalf falls), everyone who suggests to take the Ring to West or (god forbid) to hide it are all idiotic fools… right?\n\n \n\nOh and don't forget to scold the guy who have been fighting a long lost war for his entire life.\nGondor has kept force of Mordor at bay for so long, but what does Gandalf do?

I want to respond to some of your points, Ellareth, not in order to \"prove you wrong\", because I think these points are truly a matter of how you look at it and how you interpret actions, and there is no \"wrong\" in that sense. Moreso, I just think there's some good discussion fodder in there that I want to engage with.\n\n- Gandalf and the quest for Erebor: On this point, I can't really dispute your assessment. The whole plan always struck me as a bit crazy, at least when I read the Hobbit for the first time as an adult. They traveled all the way to Smaug's doorstep without having the slightest clue how they were going to get rid of the dragon. In fact, they seemed a bit confused as to whether this was just treasure recovery or home recovery as well. You would hope that maybe Gandalf could give Thorin some advice or at least press the Dwarves to formulate an action plan. I guess you really have to attribute his faith in the quest to intuition, as you said. I have to ask, does Gandalf have a large amount of foreknowledge that he doesn't share with people? Or is he guided by impulses that he himself does not fully understand?\n\n- Elrond council plan: I get the sense that Gandalf wanted to make an end of Sauron once and for all, and so he tried to guide the discussion to that end, speaking against all other options. I think when you put everything in the context of the events of all three ages, and the general waning of power of the \"free peoples\", Gandalf probably felt that there was no way that Sauron could be defeated conventionally, as he was in the Second Age (at great cost), as that level of power did not exist anymore, and certainly he probably had in mind the fact that the defeat of Sauron's mentor, Morgoth, at the end of the First Age required the intervention of the godlike Valar, which again was no longer a possibility. In this light, the only possible way to beat Sauron would be to destroy the ring. All other options would simply lead to eventual defeat, including trying to send it away. So even though the trip to Mordor was pretty much a suicide mission with little chance of success, I imagine it seemed like the only course of action in Gandalf's eyes.\n\nYou're right though, not sharing his ultimate plan for getting into Mordor, especially since he was highly aware of the dangers of the road, especially once they chose to go into Moria, is hard to understand. I'm tempted to say that Gandalf didn't have a plan. Perhaps he hoped to find guidance or inspiration along the way.\n\n- Gondor: Yeah, I have to admit that Aragorn's destiny and his \"return\" to kingship is probably one of my least favorite aspects of the story. Denethor's great crime, in Gandalf's eyes, was in his desire to use the ring as a weapon and his willingness to use compromised means (the palantir) to fight Sauron. While I think we can easily sympathize with Denethor's desire to defend Gondor at all costs, I'm sure Gandalf has in mind past figures who confronted the Enemy with a drive to power and disunity (Feanor, Feanor's sons, Thingol, etc.). I feel like Gandalf is confronting more the shadow of what he feels Denethor will become rather than strictly who he is at that moment.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70621-favourite-tolkien-character-non-game/?do=findComment&comment=786183","commentId":786183,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1366254395,"content":"Raven1015 said:\n\n \n\n \n\n- Gandalf and the quest for Erebor: On this point, I can't really dispute your assessment.

So you may be right that he knew far more than he let on. What is astounding about the quest for Erebor and the successful defeat of Smaug is that it hinged on Bilbo finding the weak spot, the dragon being flushed out (because I doubt the Dwarves themselves could've made use of the weak spot), then this being communicated to someone in Lake-Town who would be able to make use of it, and then a one-in-a-million shot from Bard to finish the deed. Whew! Again, either Gandalf had some level of foreknowledge that something like this would happen as long as he got the wheels in motion, or he just had an amazing level of faith. \n\nNow that I've pondered more about Gandalf, him not giving advice to the Dwarves actually does make sense. Gandalf is not really a strategist, or a great warrior, or as much a master of lore as Saruman, or anything else that we associate with the powerful. His skill is in inspiring people and bringing unity and hope. The rest is up to the people involved themselves. But Ellareth's point is fair that to the people involved in those schemes, like Denethor, Gandalf's approach must have seemed absolutely maddening, mystifying, and slightly hare-brained at times.\n\nFinal point, back to the Council of Elrond and the plan to take the ring to Mordor. Thinking about Gandalf as someone who learned from Nienna (the Valar associated with grief, sorrow, and strength/hope through suffering), it makes sense that he would choose the hardest road, or at least, would not shy away from the hardest road, knowing that the greatest victory must come from the greatest sorrow. And given the nature of the ring, it had be a humble, unimportant person with little power (in the traditional sense) to carry it.\n\nP.S. I agree about Denethor's depiction in the movies.

It does seem to make a lot of sense, but only if you look at it from a certain point of view. I also don't like the eagles option either. One of the things I brought up in another similar discussion elsewhere, other than the usual arguments (they could be shot down, eagles aren't a \"taxi service\", etc.) is the likelihood that Sauron had servants (including those that could fly) watching the movements of the eagles at all times. As soon as they took flight in the general direction of Mordor, and as soon as they were spotted bearing a hobbit, Sauron would be all over that. One person wrote about the possibility of the eagles flying separately from the fellowship, meeting them near the northern border of Mordor, then Frodo hopping on and popping over the mountains before anyone could do anything about it. Again, I think this is easier said than done. I also think it's important to remember that much more so than any of the other inhabitants of Middle-Earth at the time, save perhaps Gandalf, the eagles are servants of the Valar (Manwe specifically). It seems likely that they are not inclined to direct interference in matters until they become truly desperate.\n\nThat's interesting about the peak of mount doom not aligning directly with the cracks, i hadn't heard that before. \n\nOne other option I remember from the council is sending the ring west on a ship to Valinor. I don't remember the exact quote, but I believe it was either Gandalf or Elrond who said something about it not being accepted there, and that the powers there would not take part in the affairs of Middle-Earth. Interesting also that there wasn't a mention of possibly giving the ring to Galadriel. I don't think she would be more able to withstand Mordor than Elrond or Bombadil, but it is an interesting omission, particularly as she is the oldest of the Eldar still in Middle-Earth. Anyway, it still seems that all other options were moot, as without actually destroying the ring, Sauron would probably have been able to win conventionally. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70621-favourite-tolkien-character-non-game/?do=findComment&comment=786728","commentId":786728,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1366380391,"content":"Dear god am I loving these discussions!\n\nRich, I would love a periodic Tolkien Lore discussions. Weekly sounds good, or however often previous thread sort of 'dies out'. I would assume there are others with same mind, but if not, atleast you will have my support <3.\n\nAs for the Eagles flying to Mordor, it was definitely a plothole in the movie.\nIn the movies (Hobbits included), they come and go whenever Gandalf called them via moss Mt.Doom clearly had visible opening from top, and there were no turrets or towers high enough for Orcs to fire arrow at them. I assume most people who says 'they should've gone with Eagle' are the ones who have only seen the movie.\n\nHowever, like the rest of you guys, Eagle was not the option in the book for the reasons already stated. I mean they feared to go hunting because of some woodmen's bow. Can't imagine any of eagles breaking through whatever defence Sauron has (even the mountains are protected by invisible will)\n\nSo what to do with the One Ring if not to destroy it?\nTo me, only logical thing to do is to hide it in the last line of defence against Sauron.\n\nFor Denethor, it was Minas Tirith (Ithilien, Osgiliath and Rammas Echor being frontal lines). However, as much as I like Denethor, I must disagree and say entire Gondor is but first line of defence in reality.\nLast line of defence against Sauron is probably Mithlond, the Grey Heaven.\nWhich makes perfect sense because you can atleast prevent Sauron from gaining One Ring (thus making it easier for hosts from Valinor to retake Middle-Earth from Sauron) by shipping the Ring to Valinor. If Valars would not have the Ring near their lands, atleast you can cast it into the Ocean and buy yourself extra couple centuries (maybe millenias).\n\nNow, Gandalf said sending to Valinor or casting into Ocean wasn't an option because it wouldn't be a permanent solution. Sauron would return sooner or later and they must act for future as well.\nI say there is no permanent solution to evil, with or without Sauron evil will always return in one form or another and Gandalf is only interested in 'defeating' Sauron because that is his assignment from Valar."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70621-favourite-tolkien-character-non-game/?do=findComment&comment=786756","commentId":786756,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1366384530,"content":"thanks ellareth…..i really feel these discussions are breathing a new form of life into this forum!

I gotta get that letter collection book one of these days as I am clearly missing out on chunks of informations.\n\n \n\nAnd Valar forsaking Middle-Earth is a possibility. In fact Sauron convinced himself that Valar were done with Middle-Earth after reshaping of Arda. That the physical seperation of Valinor from rest of the world was a sign that Iluvatar himself does not wish for Valar to interfere and that he(Sauron) could get away with anything as long as it didn't effect Valinor.\n\nAfter all, most of Valar (except one or two, most notably Yavana), were content enough to let Melkor rule Middle-Earth for god knows how long until very last moment when they had to fight Melkor because Elves woke up. There may have been no Orcs at all if Valar had just dealt with Melkor few decades earlier instead of procrastinating for so long, if If we take the theory of Orcs being distorted Elves to be true.
