I have been told so many times to \"do what the card says\"...i am really frustrated now...how many cards do i have that say one thing and mean something else.\n\n\n\nThe card says very clearly... . \"Discard a card from your hand 2to add....\" There is no provisions on the card limiting it to only ONCE a turn. Still, look at the card.. there is NOTHING on the card that says you can not do it multiple times, you do not need to tap it even.. you just discard a card to do it... that is the end of an action, then hey .. I'll do a 2nd action, that is a 2nd card discard. You just need to read the cards very carefully, the card behaves exactly as it is written, so to know how the card works.. you just need to read it.\n\nIt is true that these types of card games foster \"game lawyers\". It is just something you get used to the complex interaction of rules, as you play more of these type of games.\n\nThere is the argument that they could have made it \"discard X cards to give +X... \" this would have been clearer. Though there is a subtle difference here, as that card would discard all the cards in a single action. While at the moment to discard 10 cards is 10 actions. This leaves the game rules with the ability to disrupt this card at any time between each action. Say they make a location \"Every player action add a encounter card to the staging area\" or something like that. In these games many card are designed in a way that is a little odd, to allow the designers to add more functionality to the game latter."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59163-wait-wait-waitprotector-of-lorien/?do=findComment&comment=581213","commentId":581213,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1326878184,"content":"So unless the card specifically limits the number of times you can use its action, you can assume it can be used over and over"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59163-wait-wait-waitprotector-of-lorien/?do=findComment&comment=581217","commentId":581217,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326878484,"content":"yes.
