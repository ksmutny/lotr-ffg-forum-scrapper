It would nicely off-set the fact he also clearly will be getting 4 artifact attachments (which enable any of the 4 heroes to be all 4 spheres at once).\n\n \n\nI also expect to get saga hero Aragorn and Neutral Aragorn at some point just because. In fact I would even be unsurprised to learn that a future edition of the game adds an Aragorn sphere. \n\nHe does seem to be very popular. \n\n \n\nEdit: Maybe we'll get Bilbo sphere Aragorn too.\n\nEdited October 31, 2014 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126082-potential-for-an-aragorn-ally/?do=findComment&comment=1317675","commentId":1317675,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1414762579,"content":"It's good to be the king."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126082-potential-for-an-aragorn-ally/?do=findComment&comment=1317722","commentId":1317722,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1414765329,"content":"Just for fun:\n\n \n\nAragorn (Neutral Hero)  Threat: 12\n\n \n\nWill: 2\n\nAttack: 3\n\nDefense: 2\n\n \n\nHP: 5\n\n \n\nAction: Take 1 resource from Aragorn's resource pool and add it to another hero's resource pool.  Limit once per round.\n\n \n\nAction: Exhaust Aragorn to add his (defense) to another character's (defense) until the end of the phase.  Limit once per phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126082-potential-for-an-aragorn-ally/?do=findComment&comment=1317917","commentId":1317917,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1414773931,"content":"I'd love to see an Aragorn ally, and I think we'll see one in the near future."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126082-potential-for-an-aragorn-ally/?do=findComment&comment=1317953","commentId":1317953,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1414775005,"content":"They still can surprise us with Aragorn ally, there is 2 packs left unexplored."}]}
