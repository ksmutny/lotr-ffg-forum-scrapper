Choose Enemy\n\n2. Declare Defender\n\n3. Resolve Shadow Effect\n\n4. Determine Combat Damage\n\n \n\nAnd the rulebook says, \"Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step.\"  So you flip over and resolve the shadow effect.  Before you substract your character's defense from the enemy's attack, you can play any action (such as Durin's Song) to boost your defending character's defense, and then you determine combat damage. \n\n \n\nYou would count your defending character's newly enhanced defense stat, not what it was originally.\n\nEdited July 30, 2014 by chiller087"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112051-grimbeorn-the-old-and-timing-guestion/?do=findComment&comment=1177254","commentId":1177254,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1406765048,"content":"Looking at the wording, I'd have to say that he stays with the first player.  My reasoning: He joins the first player as an ally once there are 8 resource tokens on him - this is a constant passive effect.  Nothing I know of removes those resource tokens, hence when the first player changes, Grimbeorn will move to that player as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112051-grimbeorn-the-old-and-timing-guestion/?do=findComment&comment=1177787","commentId":1177787,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1406803901,"content":"Thanks for answers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
