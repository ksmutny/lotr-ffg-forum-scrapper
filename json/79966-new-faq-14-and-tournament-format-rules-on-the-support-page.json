A new FAQ (1.4) is up, with a BUNCH of errata and other clarifications. Big ones are Master of Lore, Feint, Narvi's Belt, Thror's Map, Blocking Wargs, and a bunch of others.\n\n2. A Tournament Format document is also up! FINALLY! It's two teams versus each other each round, playing the same scenario and using a chess clock. First team to complete the Quest wins. Pretty cool. This is probably why there is so much errata in the FAQ this time, to remove as much NPE stuff as possible in preparation for these tournaments."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79966-new-faq-14-and-tournament-format-rules-on-the-support-page/?do=findComment&comment=768177","commentId":768177,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1361994504,"content":"Normally I hate erratas in a game but most of these seem like okay fixes with tournaments coming.
