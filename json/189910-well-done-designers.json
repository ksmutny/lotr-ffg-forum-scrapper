Specifically, I think Vilya and Mirror of Galadriel would be really strong for ally attachments.\n\nThe fact that OHUH Gandalf is relatively \"under-played\" and that he has a significant disadvantage for remaining in play meant that they felt leaving Gandalf's toys available for the allies was OK.\n\nAnother example that I believe someone else brought up before was that Leadership Hero Faramir has an a ability that would make ally Faramir extremely powerful, so they made sure it was on a card with the same name so that it could not legally target ally Faramir.\n\nAny other examples of good work by the designers done in these somewhat stealthy ways?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189910-well-done-designers/?do=findComment&comment=1826050","commentId":1826050,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1443573141,"content":"This doesn't have anything to do with card abilities, but the designers do their research and use actual Sindarin names when making up characters.\n\nFor example, \"Rossiel\" means \"red-haired girl\", Naurlhug means \"fire serpent\" (not very creative, I know), and Thaurdir means \"dreadful/horrible man\" (now I wonder why Amarthiul is surprised when Thaurdir turns out to be an evil wrath)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189910-well-done-designers/?do=findComment&comment=1826185","commentId":1826185,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1443579505,"content":"Oh, interesting."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189910-well-done-designers/?do=findComment&comment=1826441","commentId":1826441,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1443590602,"content":"I am going to disagree on this one with you here.

You're probably right that it wouldn't have been game breakingly strong if they had been allowed to use their attachment, but it's obvious they intended those attachments to only go on the heroes and they found a good way to enforce what they wanted.\n\nBTW, I think Vilya on an ally is to strong because the exhaustion requirement isn't as big of a downside because an allies action tend to be worth less than a heroes's.\n\nAlso, the fact that they are 1-turn allies means they could more appropriately give them high stats without making them too expensive, because we all know it's already difficult enough to pay for the 3-cost allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189910-well-done-designers/?do=findComment&comment=1826734","commentId":1826734,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1443613842,"content":"Well, we have Gildor who has the same stat box as an ally Elrond, and he costs 5. However, Elrond does instant impact upon entering the game, while Gildor needs to exhaust his precious himself to do stuff (from the design perspective, same Elrond ally without \"discard at the end of the round\" text should cost more than Gildor).\n\n \n\nThat depends on an ally, I must say. Elrond ally has 11-threat worth of stats, outmatching numerous heroes. He is extremely good at both questing and defending, while also decent at attacking. To me, his action is extremely precious.\n\n \n\nWell, I think it was kind of the point of their creation. They were also trying to achieve thematic goal here, to represent Elrond and Galadriel helping Frodo on his journey, but only for some time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189910-well-done-designers/?do=findComment&comment=1826788","commentId":1826788,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1443616496,"content":"> Faramir Hero would work really well with Faramir ally.

With cheap ways to ready ally Faramir already in the game, I don't see how allowing one additional method would make it overpowered. I think they just had a cool idea for a hero ability and wanted it to be on someone well known, and Faramir happened to be featured in an upcoming expansion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189910-well-done-designers/?do=findComment&comment=1826834","commentId":1826834,"userName":"DunedainLoreKeeper","timestamp":1443619367,"content":"Hmmm, considering how few ally-readying effects there are compared to hero readying, I'd say if Elrond (hero) was a 5 cost ally, he would be less powerful.\n\n \n\nTo be honest I can't think of any examples of unique characters who would break the game if they could be combined with their counterpart. Faramir has such a setup it's amost a shame that his combo isn't possible for creative deck-builders. I would actually like to thank the designers for the opposite though: thank you for making remakes of existing characters so different from each other, that I'm not frustrated by their mutual exclusion. So far I've only had the urge to put both Merrys in one deck. \n\n \n\nGetting back on topic, I think it's a neat touch that Leadership Faramir and Galadriel are some of the best hero's to use with core-Gandalf. Both of them deeply respected the wizard in the books. Now make me proud designers and give us a card that makes Elf-friend and Tactics Gimli have a super combo!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189910-well-done-designers/?do=findComment&comment=1908086","commentId":1908086,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1448506770,"content":"Back to the Sindarin names again:\n\n \n\nAmarthiul: amarth means doom/fate, and iul means embers.

There isn't any Sindarin root chan; the closest I could find searching the internet was chae which means ground.
