However no one really seemed to notise it which was a shame. So I'll credit Gizlivadi for this line of ideas and hope people will join in with their thoughts this time :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] \n\n \n\nThis just occurred to me while posting in another thread. We got Delux expansions preluding 6 x adventure packs. Then we have the PoD special event packs. And the saga expansions. But do you think we will see som AP's that will suppliment the saga expansions? Not whole 6 pack cycles maybe but rather an AP from time to time to give som more quests following the story in the sagas? Like if we won't see the Barrow Down in the LotR saga expansions, maybe FFG would think afterwards \"Hm, this might be an interesting quest after all\" and then release it as an AP to supplement either the Black riders box or the full collection of saga boxes?\n\nWhat do you think? A good/bad idea? Likely/not likely?\n\nEdited August 22, 2013 by mr.thomasschmidt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88985-saga-expansions-aps-what-do-you-think/?do=findComment&comment=847127","commentId":847127,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377168396,"content":"not a bad idea. i would see these coming out after the entire saga packs have finished- sort of the preludes that were being discussed the other day. these are an excellent way of ffg keeping the game going\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88985-saga-expansions-aps-what-do-you-think/?do=findComment&comment=847164","commentId":847164,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1377172197,"content":"I fully approve this thread.
