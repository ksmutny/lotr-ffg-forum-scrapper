Maybe then Tactics theoden gets a little more love in an odd tactics questing deck (teowyn, theoden, and galadriel would have an out the gate questing ability of 13... and a decent starting threat of 27)\n\nI doubt it would give you a silvan boon though, since her spirit version does that too well. If there was a hero version, I would imagine there has to be another dynamic with nenya that we haven't considered. Something like \"while galadriel is ready, raise your threat by two to cancel the when revealed effects of the first encounter card revealed this phase (limit once per phase).\"\n\nSince nenya can trigger after staging, the conventional wisdom would to not quest with galadriel, use her ability, then trigger nenya. Light of valinor on her would be bonkers.\n\nThat's all to say I still don't believe it's a hero.

It could very well be art for any of the four remaining cards but if anyone can go it alone, it would be Galadriel!\n> \n> Well done! Cannot wait to try these cards some time in 2021!\n\nThe news says much more than that!!\n\nHere is What the description of the french news says, and it says a lot in the text. For instance Nori Tactics ally is spoiled (but without image) \n\n\nLeadership:\n\n\nCard 55: The Power to command\n\nAttachment\n\nMaster\n\nGives +1 Will to each unique caracter you control.\n\nCard 56: To the Horns\n\nEvent\n\nDoom card. The news says each player can put into play in the combat phase an ally in play to add it's attack to the current attack. (i think it will return to hand at the end of the phase though)\n\nLore:\nCard 57:\n\n(maybe Isengard) \n\nAlly\n\nCard58: Sharp Eye\n\nEvent. \n\nIt is a scrying event with the doom keyword.\n\nTactics:\n\nCard 59: *Nori \n\nAlly\n\nCard 60: Golden belt\n\nAttachment\n\nSpirit.\n\nCard 61: Rhohirrim scout\n\nAlly\n\nCard 62: ??\n\nCard 63: Sarouman Staff\n\nCard 74: The Grey wanderer (contract) \n\nYou must play with a unique hero, but you can start with the attachment of your choice in play.\n\nThe news says it gives an amazing ability to your unique Hero, but don't says any precision. \n\nI'm so eager to know what it is.\n\nSo obviously the illustration of Galadriel is not the contract. I think it Will be the Lore Event, Sharp eye.\n\n \n\nEdited November 13, 2019 by Valiko33"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302069-3rd-pack-of-vengeance-of-mordor-cycle-le-d%C3%A9fi-des-gens-des-chariots-in-french/?do=findComment&comment=3827758","commentId":3827758,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1573638698,"content":"Or maybe the illistration refers to a new card to come in a future pack.

We don't have any more information (no visual of the card) but it is already interesting.\n\n\nWow, so solo Hero starts with Steward of Gondor (hard to imagine why this wouldn't be the go-to, unless its restricted to an item or something), and then in the opening hand mulligan for Strider and Resourceful(s).  Could be surprisingly viable, seeing as it basically wouldn't take any hit to resource production and with Resourcefuls alone has the potential to produce six resources a turn pretty easily, while questing at +2 WP without exhausting.  Potential, if the bonus-ability to the solo hero can compensate for the lack of bodies to defend and attack.  My guess is it will benefit your allies somehow or have a built-in 'ready solo hero' feature.\n\nSo far I'm quite impressed with the viability of all the contracts so far, as I've seen Fellowship and Forth the Three Hunters work on table, with strong potential for Burglar's Turn (especially if a few more quality guarded items come out this cycle).  They really, really go a long way to spice up deck construction more than anything else."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302069-3rd-pack-of-vengeance-of-mordor-cycle-le-d%C3%A9fi-des-gens-des-chariots-in-french/?do=findComment&comment=3828130","commentId":3828130,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1573668136,"content":"Yes, Steward or vilya with Elrond are probably two go-to attachments,  unless any restriction do not allow it. \n\nBut let's see the full text and ability before final judgment. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302069-3rd-pack-of-vengeance-of-mordor-cycle-le-d%C3%A9fi-des-gens-des-chariots-in-french/?do=findComment&comment=3828611","commentId":3828611,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1573713751,"content":"giphy.gif [http://giphygifs.s3.amazonaws.com/media/rl0FOxdz7CcxO/giphy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302069-3rd-pack-of-vengeance-of-mordor-cycle-le-d%C3%A9fi-des-gens-des-chariots-in-french/?do=findComment&comment=3828990","commentId":3828990,"userName":"McDog3","timestamp":1573752822,"content":"> On 11/12/2019 at 2:24 PM, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> Correct me if I am wrong but the text seems more along the lines of \"reduce by 2 the X value of the next Doomed X event you play this phase\". The wording seems a bit strange, should it perhaps apply only to Doomed X events (like Close Call and perhaps we will see some other Doomed X cards in this pack) or to all Doomed events and that X simply is the value of Doomed printed on the card (like 2 for Deep Knowledge and 4 for Legacy of Numenor)? Cause if it's the second case I think it could have been written in a more straightforward way...\n\nThe latter, it applies to all printed doomed events. \"Doomed X\" is actually the keyword for doomed cards, so it makes sense within that context. http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule124 [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule124]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302069-3rd-pack-of-vengeance-of-mordor-cycle-le-d%C3%A9fi-des-gens-des-chariots-in-french/?do=findComment&comment=3829340","commentId":3829340,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1573777728,"content":"> On 11/12/2019 at 7:01 PM, player3351457 said:\n> \n> So if I'm reading this right, we have...\n> \n> Lore Saruman (woot woot)\n> \n> Lore ally (2 cost, 2, 2, 2, 2)\n> \n> Lore event (far sighted)\n> \n> Spirit ally (rohirim scout)\n> \n> Spirit ???\n> \n> Leadership event (horns horns horns)\n> \n> Leadership attachment (power of command)\n> \n> Tactics attachment (golden belt)\n> \n> Tactics ally (Nori)\n> \n> Neutral attachment (the staff)\n> \n>  \n> \n> Well done!
