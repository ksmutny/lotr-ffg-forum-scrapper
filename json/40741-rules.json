Wednesday is LOTR LCG day!\n\nThey released Warhammer LCG rules a month and a half before the game came out, so it seems like we should have gotten them by now but I think that they had to hype the Warhammer game a lot more than this one since we're all so eager for this! So they might have released the rules sooner.

They were doing every other week which means that on the 26th we should have gotten a preview so I was pissed when we didn't get one, but hopefully this wednesday it'll happen. I just preordered the game from my local game shop and their info said the release would happen some time in February, for what it's worth. I'm going to stay optimistic for now and believe in February!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/40741-rules/?do=findComment&comment=417069","commentId":417069,"userName":"Sky","timestamp":1296484456,"content":"The french site has third part of preview for all of us to read or translate:\n\nhttp://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=181&efcid=11&efidt=137308 [http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=181&efcid=11&efidt=137308]\n\nThis time we get an interesting insight into the flow of each of the seven phases of the round :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nGreetings\n\nSky"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/40741-rules/?do=findComment&comment=421944","commentId":421944,"userName":"Sky","timestamp":1297316943,"content":"I would not count it as something very interesting, but for all scratching for any info the french site has new insight into the heroes - unfortunately so far we read about the ones we know\n\nwww.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_discusion.asp [http://www.edgeent.com/v2_fr/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=181&efcid=11&efidt=138287]\n\nSky\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/40741-rules/?do=findComment&comment=426159","commentId":426159,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1297998232,"content":"There are good news from the forum of the German publisher:\n\nNext week there will be an event at Burg Stahleck in Germany where a complete box with the final rules will be available for demo play.
