If you just leave a bunch of enemies in the staging area you will get overwhelmed pretty quickly.\n\nAdditionally, when playing multiplayer you might want to choose to engage an enemy to prevent it from engaging another player who has higher threat.\n\n2) I'm not sure I understand this question? Steward of Gondor is an attachment, do you mean \"For Gondor!\"? That only lasts until the end of the phase, so if you played it at the end of the Encounter Phase the effect would end when the encounter phase ends. Additionally, event cards are discarded immediately, only the effect stays around.\n\nWhy not just play it at the beginning of the Combat phase?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58430-encounter-phase-and-attachment-card-questions/?do=findComment&comment=574688","commentId":574688,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1325679084,"content":"also for q.1 several enemies are tied to quests.....hill troll for example, prevents you from progress to the next quest card, and sometimes you have no choice but to engage them or wait many rounds for it to engage you....sometimes you may not want to wait"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58430-encounter-phase-and-attachment-card-questions/?do=findComment&comment=574695","commentId":574695,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1325679493,"content":"1) There are many reasons for choosing to engage. Mainly for controlling the encounter deck. Choosing to fight a mob of at your choosing. This can be for something as simple as removing its threat form the staging area, or that you fell you can easily kill it off, to more complex things like avoiding card effects.. like say snipers for example... Also when playing multiplayer this is a major part of the strategies,. Just remember that you can only engage by choice 1 monster each, but all monsters will attack anyone whose threat is equal or higher... no one wants to fight 6 monsters at once.\n\n \n\n2) I \"think\" you are talking about \"For Gondor\"\n\nmed_for-gondor-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_for-gondor-core.jpg]med_steward-of-gondor-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_steward-of-gondor-core.jpg]\n\n \n\nNot Steward... but w/e this card says \"for the phase\" so.. yes.. the effect only lasts for a single phase. So you need to cast this in the combat phase during a player action step.

You cannot play Steward of Gondor during the Encounter phase, as it is an attachment. You may only play event cards or use actions while not in the planning phase. If you were to play Steward of Gondor during the planning phase, then you can exhaust it during an action window in the combat phase to get the bonus (Steward of Gondor gives 2 resources though, not +1 defense).\n\nWhen you play attachments and allies they stay in play until destroyed or removed by some effect, they are not automatically discarded like events are."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58430-encounter-phase-and-attachment-card-questions/?do=findComment&comment=574698","commentId":574698,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1325679602,"content":"@Svenn - I understand the idea of lowering threat from the staging area, but if your threat level is high enough that the enemy will engage you in step 2 anyway, your second thought makes more sense....engaging an enemy so that they do not engage another player makes a lot of sense though...\n\n\nYes - I did mean \"For Gondor\"...sorry. I was not aware that a player could play a card at the beginning of a phase...if I am not playing with Shadow cards...does the first player action (that is right after the shadow card step) get skipped? That is what I assumed.
