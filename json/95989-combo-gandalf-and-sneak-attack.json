It's a little more to keep track of, but I prefer the easy set up of one deck.\n\nIt's a great solo game. And 2 victories out of 4 is great. Before jumping into 2 deck play, I would recommend building a duel sphere deck, and even a tri sphere. Lot's of new decisions to make and test out new strategies."}]}
