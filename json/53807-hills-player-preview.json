No point in spending money on a pack that has only one or two cards that would find themselves in a deck. Less true with LotR since Quest and Encounter deck cards would see play. There are no Ultra Rares to get in LCGs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53807-hills-player-preview/?do=findComment&comment=534053","commentId":534053,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1317199260,"content":"I also prefer to know what is in an upcoming set.
