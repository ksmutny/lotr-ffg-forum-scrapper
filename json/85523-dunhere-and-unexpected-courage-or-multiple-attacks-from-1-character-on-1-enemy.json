Is it possible for Dunhere to attack the same enemy in the staging area twice using the unexpected courage to ready in between?

But if FAQ is right, are those follow up attacks to be added together (as in the rule book whenever more characters attack the same enemy) enabling him to overcome the enemy armor easier thus counting the armor only once? Or does each attack subtract the armor individually?\n\nOr more simple: which one is the correct way?\n\nDunhere attacks in the staging area (= attack 3) the same enemy (armor 2) twice with readying in between…\n\na) (3 - 2) + (3 - 2) = 2 damage done\n\nb) (3 + 3) - 2 = 4 damage done\n\nThank you!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85523-dunhere-and-unexpected-courage-or-multiple-attacks-from-1-character-on-1-enemy/?do=findComment&comment=806233","commentId":806233,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1372193576,"content":"You can only declare an attack against each enemy once per round, per player.\n\nThe confusion comes because there is a distinction between player and character.\n\nEach player may declare an attack against one enemy once per round (no exceptions).\n\nEach character can attack an enemy as many times as the attack can be legally declared and that character is in a Ready state (in other words, there is no written limit on the number of attacks that a character can participate in, even against the same enemy).\n\nConfused yet?

Quick Strike says that the character is readied and immediately declared an attacker against any eligible enemy target. It doesn't say that Aragorn can attack the same enemy that his player has already declared an attack against. Ordinarily, declaring an attack on an enemy makes it ineligible for a second attack, and I don't see why Quick Strike would override that. I interpret the card effect to mean that Aragorn is readied and declared an attacker against an eligible enemy target, i.e. one that is engaged but that Aragorn's controlling player has not yet declared an attack against.
