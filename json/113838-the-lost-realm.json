With Aragorn tactics in the spotlight there will be no Dunedain leadership hero to play, unless we use core set Aragorn, but i bet the developers will give us the opportunity to play the Dunedain event to use Ranger of the north without relying on the older version of Aragorn, so we can play the new tactics version.\n\nMy hope is that the 2nd hero will have a threat of 7 or lower. So, if Idrean and Aragorn are paired we would be at 30 threat. Aragorn and Beravor would be 29 threat, and if new 7 threat hero were paired with Beravor and Idrean we would be at 28 threat.

Meaning it can't summon anything else. So it's one event for one out of play card. As for recycling, if you read the card text, this summoning event will not be placed into the discard pile - it is removed from the game, means no recycling allowed. \n\n \n\nWhat I find interesting about this encounter deck ranger, is that it can be wasted through shadow (sparing you an unshadowed attack though) AND if he is destroyed, then he goes into the encounter discard pile and if encounter deck is reshuffled - you can hope to see him again (and be wasted by shadow again :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113838-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1210221","commentId":1210221,"userName":"Johnny Awesome","timestamp":1408392718,"content":"The Ranger of the North will be good in 4-player games where you cycle the encounter deck, but pretty useless for solo IMO.\n\n \n\nRule clarification: When it says to shuffle the encounter deck, do you add the discard pile in or can you wait until the encounter deck is almost depleted before putting the Ranger in so you're likely to get him from a tiny remaining encounter deck?\n\nEdited August 18, 2014 by Johnny Awesome"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113838-the-lost-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1210318","commentId":1210318,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1408395264,"content":"Wow, just... wow. \n\n \n\nThese mechanics are really innovative and impressive.

As for his other ability, I hate that it requires you to make a kill first, so generally you'll have to wait until the other player has already defended an attack first (Quick Strike is a valuable alternative). Of course, you can also use it on enemies in the staging area, which means you can have a turn to attack it without having to defend it that round. I just wonder how often that scenario will play out with a high-threat Dunedain and/or Tactics deck. There are also a few other ways to pull enemies to you, (e.g. Westfold Outrider), so I don't feel like we need his ability, though a consistent ability available on a hero is nice and he can pull multiple enemies per round assuming he can kill multiple enemies per round.\n\n \n\nAn interesting combo can come from cards like Noiseless Movement, Advance Warning, and/or A Light in the Dark that can keep enemies in the staging area, so we can avoid having to defend, but then (assuming we engaged at least one enemy or we had one engaged from the previous turn), we can kill an enemy, pull a new one down, kill it, pull another down, etc. Some cool combinations related to Merry, Brand Son of Bain, Rohan Warhorse, and/or other readying effects could keep the killing cycle going. We could also have Haldir and/or Dunhere in another deck to attack them before Aragorn pulls them down.\n\n \n\nGotta have at least two decks to really make him powerful and even then I wonder how often we can make Aragorn's ability really useful.

Ungoliants Spawn reduced only Elrond and Glorindels willpower by 2 and they both survived on 1 willpower escaping her onslaught!
