I guess this isn't allowed since there is no 'discard' worded on Prince Imrahil, but I wanted to make sure since for an ally to be reshuffled into your deck you have to discard it, right? In case it was allowed, some fancy draw mechanism can be used to get your big set of Rohan allies into play quickly. Since you basically need them all to make a Rohan deck be efficient.\n\n \n\nGreetings, Jban\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238578-prince-imrahil-hero-gamling/?do=findComment&comment=2568912","commentId":2568912,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1483454063,"content":"You are correct, you can't use Gamling in this way.  You need the word \"discard\" on Imrahil.  The ally leaves play, but it is not placed in the discard pile.  There is even a difference between \"discarded\" and \"destroyed\" (destroyed allies are not discarded).  So yeah, always look for that specific word."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238578-prince-imrahil-hero-gamling/?do=findComment&comment=2568927","commentId":2568927,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1483454840,"content":"Ok, so to make it clear.
