So for example if I win a quest in the quest phase of the 10th round, the round score is 90 as I would have only played 9 full rounds.\n\nFrom the FAQ 10/16/2017, regarding Scoring: \"In addition to all elements currently used to score a game, players also add an additional 10 points to their “final group score” for each round of play that is taken to defeat a scenario. Players tally each round for their score at the end of the refresh phase.\"\n\nI'm not entirely sure, I could have interpreted this incorrectly, but I assume this means you start at 0."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307969-first-round/?do=findComment&comment=3931034","commentId":3931034,"userName":"bitzurock","timestamp":1587846103,"content":"> 8 minutes ago, stimpaksam said:\n> \n> Rounds are recorded once they are completed.
