Until the end of the round, that enemy cannot engage you.\"\n\n \n\nAm I correct in reading that, in multiplayer, this ability will just dump all the enemies on players with higher threat than you?  I was hoping to combo Pippin with the new Faramir, but because Pippin says \"cannot engage you\" rather than \"cannot engage any players,\" it looks like any enemy deflected by Pippin will just end up engaged with the next player to make an engagement check, if their threat is too high.  \n\n \n\nDo you all read this the same way?\n\nEdited August 13, 2013 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88366-pippin-and-multiplayer/?do=findComment&comment=838295","commentId":838295,"userName":"-nebur-","timestamp":1376374540,"content":"Yes, i think the same.\n\n \n\nSo it´s maybe the worst ability of all heroes (excluding Hirluin).\n\nAt least his threat and willpower is good (much more than Bilbo)...so I will use him sometimes also outside of hobbit-decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88366-pippin-and-multiplayer/?do=findComment&comment=838919","commentId":838919,"userName":"rekath16","timestamp":1376420890,"content":"Pippin is the worst hero of all.
