Your point about wanting to avoid enemies altogether with a staging area attack may be true, but it's unrealistic. There are a ton of effects in this game that force you to engage enemies. But apart from that, he actively helps you reduce your threat over time which is vital to staging area attack decks.\n\nI recently heard from someone who took a Fastred/Dunhere/Eowyn deck through the entire Haradrim cycle, and I wasn't the least bit surprised.\n\nNow, if you play primarily multiplayer I could see even more of a case for this guy. Without Fasted, you need everyone at the table to have low threat in order to have someone left for Dunhere to attack.

Only ones with low threat (and therefore likely low attack) so that you can bounce them back and maintain your threat at a low level. Dunhere is still heavily relied upon to kill enemies before they ever engage. The ratio in games I play is probably 2:1 for enemies killed without/with engagement. Since Fasted reduces your threat by 2, you only need to engage an enemy ever other turn if you really want to keep your threat low. With Beregond you'd have to defend every turn.\n\n2) Again, Beregond's higher defense isn't as useful as you'd think because the enemies with high attack tend to have high threat as well, so you don't engage them.\n\n3) My response to swapping Fastred for Beregond and Dunhere for some other attacker is this: weapons. Weapons are as important to this deck as Fastred and Dunhere. By virtue of the deck being low threat and focused on staging area attacks, there are six cards you can include in your deck (3x Spear of the Mark and 3x Dagger or Westernesse) that will give Dunhere +2 attack for a cost of 1. That's huge. You of course also run 3x Open the Armory so you can virtually guarantee you will start with a 5 attack spirit hero that only cost you 8 threat. The second weapon follows soon after to turn him into a 7 attack menace. And since he's spirit you get access to UC to really start tearing up the staging area.\n\n4) Just take a look at the Eowyn/Dunhere/Fastred lineup's first turn: Start with 23 threat. Play a weapon on Dunhere, play a 2-cost 2-WP ally, quest for 6, have a backup defender ready, and attack the staging area for 5. It's just incredible how fast the deck gets set up and how fast it continues to ramp despite no resource generation. It really is a top tier deck.\n\n \n\nEdited March 12, 2018 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3246302","commentId":3246302,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1520865971,"content":"@Seastan [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/240509-seastan/] Might we see a video from you soon featuring Fastred?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3247360","commentId":3247360,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1520916976,"content":"Alright, you've won me over.  I don't know if I'm going to roll out a deck with him in it anytime soon, but I acknowledge his virtues.\n\nLet's be honest.  This is me here.  Once I can find a gimmicky use for him, he'll be my new best friend."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3248493","commentId":3248493,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1520982774,"content":"My list of never-played heroes - Note that I almost never play solo:\n\nDori - He looks bad and I rarely play any dwarves besides Gimli and Bifur\n\nEomer (Le) - His ability is very meh, and staging area attacks are less effective in multiplayer games.\n\nFastred - Similar to Eomer.  If I'm going to do staging area attacks in solo, I prefer to never engage the enemies.\n\nGaldor of the Havens - His effect isn't very exciting, and I'd almost always rather play Erestor.\n\nKahliel - I kept waiting for more Harad support, but it never really got fleshed out.\n\nNa'asiyah - She's a hero you need to build around, but it's a very straightforward and boring build.\n\nQuickbeam - New, but also doesn't look very good.  I doubt I will try him.\n\nThurindir - I like the idea of him, but in multiplayer we almost never want to devote a turn to side quests.\n\n \n\nOther heroes that I've rarely played:\n\nGandalf, Boromir (T), Caldara, Dain, Hirluin - Too powerful for my taste.  Don't want to be \"the Gandalf guy\" at the 4 player table.\n\nBard, Brand, Lanwyn - Their lack of weapons makes me always go with Legolas or Haldir instead.  The new cycle should fix this problem.\n\nBilbo, Fatty, Dwalin, Oin, Pippin (S), Aragorn (Le) - Any deck that these would fit into, there is usually another hero with the same traits (or same name) that would be a better fit.\n\nTreebeard, Halbarad - Any deck that these would fit into, the ally is usually better."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3248528","commentId":3248528,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1520985061,"content":"Despite having the full card pool, there are plenty of heroes I've never tried...\n\n \n\nArgalad\n\nBard the Bowman\n\nBeorn\n\nSp Beregond\n\nBombur\n\nLe Boromir\n\nBrand son of Bain\n\nCeleborn\n\nDáin Ironfoot\n\nDori\n\nDúnhere\n\nDwalin\n\nElfhelm\n\nElladan\n\nElrohir\n\nLe Éomer\n\nTa Éomer\n\nLo Faramir\n\nFastred\n\nFatty Bolger\n\nFolco Boffin\n\nFrodo Baggins\n\nGlóin\n\nHalbarad\n\nHaldir of Lórien\n\nHirgon\n\nIdraen\n\nLanwyn\n\nSp Legolas\n\nTa Merry\n\nMirlonde\n\nNa'asiyah\n\nNori\n\nÓin\n\nOri\n\nSp Pippin\n\nLe Prince Imrahil\n\nTa Prince Imrahil\n\nQuickbeam\n\nRossiel\n\nThalin\n\nTa Théoden\n\nSp Théoden\n\nThorin Oakenshield\n\nTom Cotton\n\nTreebeard\n\n \n\no_O"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3248745","commentId":3248745,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1520997655,"content":" \n\n> 4 hours ago, Teamjimby said:\n> \n> Galdor of the Havens - His effect isn't very exciting, and I'd almost always rather play Erestor.\n\nI love Galdor!  Always happy when I figure out a deck that works with him.  I like Erestor too, but I dislike how he so strongly dictates your playstyle.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3248752","commentId":3248752,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1520998726,"content":"> 16 minutes ago, GrandSpleen said:\n> \n>  \n> \n> I love Galdor!  Always happy when I figure out a deck that works with him.  I like Erestor too, but I dislike how he so strongly dictates your playstyle.  \n\nAlso a Galdor fan.

Some of these Heroes are just new, so I haven't built enough decks from them yet. Others are primarily multiplayer-focused, so they rarely hit my table.  Still others are frequently lambasted for being bad Heroes, so it's not too surprising I haven't used them much. But what is Beravor doing there? How could I have been ignoring her this whole time? I suspect it has something to do with my propensity to build thematic decks; maybe she has too much competition in Dúnedain decks.\n\nMy full list is attached if anyone wants to look at it.\n\nHeroFrequency.txt [//community.fantasyflightgames.com/applications/core/interface/file/attachment.php?id=8233]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3252650","commentId":3252650,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1521328595,"content":"Here are my results:\n\n\n27 \t Pippin (Lore)\n23 \t Galadriel (Spirit)\n21 \t Glorfindel (Spirit)\n21 \t Sam Gamgee (Leadership)\n16 \t Denethor (Leadership)\n15 \t Frodo Baggins (Spirit)\n14 \t Merry (Spirit)\n14 \t Tom Cotton (Tactics)\n11 \t Arwen Undómiel (Spirit)\n11 \t Folco Boffin (Lore)\n10 \t Aragorn (Lore)\n10 \t Elrond (Lore)\n9 \t Éowyn (Tactics)\n8 \t Hirluin the Fair (Leadership)\n8 \t Mablung (Tactics)\n8 \t Merry (Tactics)\n7 \t Bifur (Lore)\n7 \t Boromir (Tactics)\n6 \t Beregond (Spirit)\n6 \t Dáin Ironfoot (Leadership)\n6 \t Gandalf (Neutral)\n5 \t Amarthiúl (Leadership)\n5 \t Damrod (Lore)\n5 \t Kahliel (Leadership)\n5 \t Legolas (Spirit)\n5 \t Théodred (Leadership)\n4 \t Boromir (Leadership)\n4 \t Caldara (Spirit)\n4 \t Celeborn (Leadership)\n4 \t Éowyn (Spirit)\n4 \t Erestor (Lore)\n4 \t Gimli (Leadership)\n4 \t Gríma (Lore)\n4 \t Hirgon (Tactics)\n4 \t Prince Imrahil (Tactics)\n4 \t Théoden (Spirit)\n3 \t Faramir (Leadership)\n3 \t Galdor of the Havens (Lore)\n3 \t Glóin (Leadership)\n3 \t Haldir of Lórien (Lore)\n3 \t Háma (Tactics)\n3 \t Quickbeam (Tactics)\n3 \t Thorin Oakenshield (Leadership)\n2 \t Círdan the Shipwright (Spirit)\n2 \t Gimli (Tactics)\n2 \t Lanwyn (Spirit)\n1 \t Balin (Leadership)\n1 \t Beregond (Tactics)\n1 \t Bilbo Baggins (Lore)\n1 \t Denethor (Lore)\n1 \t Dúnhere (Spirit)\n1 \t Dwalin (Spirit)\n1 \t Elladan (Tactics)\n1 \t Elrohir (Leadership)\n1 \t Fastred (Spirit)\n1 \t Fatty Bolger (Spirit)\n1 \t Idraen (Spirit)\n1 \t Legolas (Tactics)\n1 \t Mirlonde (Lore)\n1 \t Nori (Spirit)\n1 \t Pippin (Spirit)\n0 \t Aragorn (Leadership)\n0 \t Aragorn (Tactics)\n0 \t Aragorn (Fellowship)\n0 \t Aragorn (Fellowship)\n0 \t Aragorn (Fellowship)\n0 \t Argalad (Lore)\n0 \t Bard the Bowman (Tactics)\n0 \t Beorn (Tactics)\n0 \t Beravor (Lore)\n0 \t Bilbo Baggins (Baggins)\n0 \t Bilbo Baggins (Baggins)\n0 \t Bombur (Lore)\n0 \t Brand son of Bain (Tactics)\n0 \t Dori (Tactics)\n0 \t Eleanor (Spirit)\n0 \t Elfhelm (Leadership)\n0 \t Éomer (Tactics)\n0 \t Éomer (Leadership)\n0 \t Erkenbrand (Leadership)\n0 \t Faramir (Lore)\n0 \t Frodo Baggins (Fellowship)\n0 \t Frodo Baggins (Fellowship)\n0 \t Frodo Baggins (Fellowship)\n0 \t Frodo Baggins (Fellowship)\n0 \t Glorfindel (Lore)\n0 \t Halbarad (Leadership)\n0 \t Na'asiyah (Tactics)\n0 \t Óin (Spirit)\n0 \t Ori (Lore)\n0 \t Prince Imrahil (Leadership)\n0 \t Rossiel (Lore)\n0 \t Thalin (Tactics)\n0 \t Théoden (Tactics)\n0 \t Thurindir (Lore)\n0 \t Treebeard (Lore)\n\nThis show my obsession to secrecy decks with all the hero I use in them in the top8 places ^^."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3252793","commentId":3252793,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1521345988,"content":"My result was a bit skewed by my practice of saving multiple versions of a single deck.  But the top hero was not surprising to me: Damrod!  I love traps.  Here are my top 10:\n\n\n16 \t Damrod (Lore)\n13 \t Elrond (Lore)\n13 \t Merry (Tactics)\n11 \t Galadriel (Spirit)\n11 \t Pippin (Lore)\n9 \t Arwen Undómiel (Spirit)\n9 \t Frodo Baggins (Spirit)\n8 \t Aragorn (Leadership)\n8 \t Éowyn (Spirit)\n8 \t Gríma (Lore)\n\nSurprised to see Grima as high as he is.  \n\nAt the bottom of the list, there are some 0's, but they are all heroes I have used multiple times.  Erestor, the twins, Gloin...  I used to make and save decks with a different deckbuilder, so those are lost to posterity.  The only one I have legitimately not used is Quickbeam.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3252798","commentId":3252798,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1521346340,"content":"And by the way thanks for doing that Seastan!

I build a lot more decks than I play, due to vast amounts of spare time without access to my cards or octgn. Therefore, a lot of my decks ends up being very similar, as I don’t tire of building the “same” deck once each month. This may explain how Amarthiul, a very specialized hero that works “better” in multiplayer, ends up being number seven in my solo oriented deck collection. Another reason might be my love for the dúnedain archetype.\n\nCirdan is another favourite hero of mine, as is Boromir, Galadriel and Elrond. Denethor and Sp Eowyn surprise me a little bit, as I sort of don’t like Èowyn, and I don’t remember building so much with Denethor. They are really powerful though, which might explain things. Sam is equally surprising, I don’t like hobbits, or leadership.\n\nPerhaps the biggest surprise is Legolas. I find him to be an interesting hero, and use him a lot more than I use le Gimli. One of my favourite decks is le Denethor, sp Legolas and lo Glorfindel. I like the combination of sp Legolas, Elven-Light, Steward of Orthanc and Keys of Orthanc. A hero ready and two cards for one threat! Speaking about Glorfindel, I actually have 6 (!) decks with his lore version. After a bit of research, my Lorefindel decks vary from mono lore to tri sphere, and contain several pure noldor decks. Very interesting indeed. Twelve threat for 3wp, 3atk and 5 hp is not that great, but his good traits helps him a lot. LoV and Rivendell Blade works as good with him as with his overused spirit version. And he has the greatest ability in the world, his name and sphere. Really. In sphere Asfaloth. And card draw. Plus that one game in five years when his healing saves you a game. Everyone must hear about Glorfindel’s greatness, how he “won” a hard archery quest, like Helm’s Deep, for you. It will be worth using him for that moment"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3268841","commentId":3268841,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1522535261,"content":"I also think Lore Glorfindel is not at all a bad hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271277-heroes-you-haven%E2%80%99t-tried-yet/?do=findComment&comment=3269730","commentId":3269730,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1522635711,"content":"\n17 \t Denethor (Leadership)\n14 \t Legolas (Tactics)\n13 \t Elrond (Lore)\n12 \t Arwen Undómiel (Spirit)\n10 \t Aragorn (Tactics)\n10 \t Gandalf (Neutral)\n8 \t Damrod (Lore)\n8 \t Pippin (Lore)\n7 \t Aragorn (Lore)\n7 \t Glorfindel (Spirit)"}]}
