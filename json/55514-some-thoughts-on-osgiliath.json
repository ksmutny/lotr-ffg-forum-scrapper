I've done so much more in the beginning of this Osgiliath experience to find out what strategies are good here, what cards are more essential than others, what combos are required to deal with certain situations. That helped me learn and understand quite a few things whithout which knowledge I think I would not be able to be nearly as successful with the quest.\n\nFor instance, at first I had thought the obvious combo was Sneaky Gandalf, later I have found out many different combos to be more effective, especially in the beginning of the game.\n\nI do not mind experiementing. Quite the opposite. I do not perceive games as sacred. When I am not feeling like finishing a game, I stop. However, I now see it may sound strange to stop after an opening hand. I just sometimes had a notion that I wanted to see a particular card interact with the encounters given. I didn't feel bad about it. That's why I wrote it down although I see some people pick a little detail and claim it as the main point.\n\nI am very glad for your kind words and I am sorry if I myself acted heated toward your response, it was mostly to the other mr. It is far fetch to give up a hand or two, or to play with 6 cards you choose. Even though that can also help you learn. And I doubt very much that the person would do perfectly well against the deck even if he chose 6 (different) cards of his liking.\n\nBorder line, I think I have a jolly good deck for Osgiliath. As I said I did not build it with Osgiliath in mind but it does well against it. Out of the ten tries, I think I can beat it more often than I lose to it (nevermind the double-mulligan, after this discussion I will have ceased this altogether, haha). That is what made me excited enough to post a bit of a strategy behind it. Because at first I had thought I might beat it once in a long while. I am sorry the strategy got kinda lost in the translation. I can see losing to Rhosgobel almost every time with it, so I do not call this a magic deck. I would like to have a deck that works for each quest and I think I could build something like that but I began to enjoy most the thematic decks, like this is being all Rohan pretty much.\n\nEnjoy!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55514-some-thoughts-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=549577","commentId":549577,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1320047218,"content":"@OP:\n\nInteresting that you don't play the Tracker.

Northern Tracker shines in Osgiliath. I have begun to think that he is not as great as he used to be in the core set scenarios or Hunt for Gollum but in Osgiliath he really helps a great time - I played him in a different deck a few times.\n\nHowever, I was really tempted to have Rohan allies only, plus Gandalf. And as I said, I did not deckbuild for this quest only. Tracker would certainly help things out some deal but the Horses, Snowbourn Scout and Ride to Ruin are also very effective against the locations you cannot travel to, or that pop up in staging for a threat of 4.\n\nThe Escort is also great to boost questing, I use Musterring the Rohirrim, Stand and Fight and Dwarven Tomb to get him out more often."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55514-some-thoughts-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=556413","commentId":556413,"userName":"gone questing","timestamp":1321397132,"content":" \nMy group won a 3-player Osgiliath scenario last night... which is why I found and posted in this thread! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n\nIn regard to the original post (OP), I can see how Dunhere would be key in 1-player, but not really an option in 3-player.\nI drew Gandalf, Sneak Attack, Ever Vigilant in my opening hand and play with two Leadership heroes. My team mate also drew Gandalf, Sneak Attack.\n\nWe started on 29 threat each and removed 3+ Wolves From Mordor and 2-3 Snaga Scout from staging and engagement, first turn.\nI believe we had two Wainrider Captains in staging but were able to use Gandalf and optional engagements to defeat enemies in steps/multiple turns so that we were careful not to reach 2A of the quest deck.\n\nFrom here we had a number of allies and had basically built-up enough that weren't re-playing turn 1 over again.\n\n- We used Protector of Lorien and Eowyn to complete 2B on the turn that we first quested against it. (ie. one turn)\n\n- Two players each discarded a Ranger of Ithilien while the third player quested with no characters, instead using Gleowine and Beravor two draw three cards and use them with Protector of Lorien.\nWe completed 3B on the turn that we first quested against it.\n\n- At this point we faced the Witch-king, Denethor absorbing the blow, and kept him in the engagement area of the player with the lowest threat.\nWe then quested with ABSOLUTELY everything and drew/tried not to play so that we could maximise Protector of Lorien, winning the game.\n\n\n\n\nWe potentially had a lucky draw in the last quest phase. On the flip side, we had just re-shuffled the encounter deck at this point.\nObviously Gandalf four times in the opening turns was huge, like Dunhere, allowing damage to be applied to enemies without engaging to defend.\nWe basically flew threw the quest as quick as we could but also pretty quick by any game standards, in my mind.\n\n\n\n\nOTHER NOTES:\n\n- we had two Morgulduin in the staging area for the majority of the game. We had some wounds on characters in the first turn, leaving them with 1-2 hit points. They were later healed, healing only really saving one character during combat.\nI don't know if i'd say healing was as important as I had previously thought.\n\n\n- Cut Off seemed to carve us up!\nI discarded four allies (out of five cards) the turn I played Daughter of Nimrodel. We faced Cut Off as a shadow effect undefended as well as defended, and cancelled the when revealed effect at least once.\nThis card makes me want to increase the proportion of allies in a deck, for this scenario.\n\n- Uruk Vanguard and The Witch-king seem like the only enemies that are just a bit too big, given everything else that's going on in this scenario.\nI guess that should give some peace of mind when facing the remaining enemies.\n\n- Beravor and Denethor died, Landroval bringing Denethor back, on the second to last turn. Possibly not a game changing play. Beravor wasn't totally missed thanks to Song of Wisdom first turn.\n\n- We played no location hate cards. Northern Tracker was packed in an Aragorn song deck containing no spirit heroes, but was not played. I believe we only travelled to Emyn Arnen Overlook.\n\n- HEROES were...\n\nAragorn, Gloin, Denethor\nBoromir, Thalin, Eowyn\nPrince Imrahil, Theodred, Beravor\n\n- Imrahil and Boromir readied a reasonable amount. They were definitely good. Imrahil some times didn't do much with his ready because of how enemies were assigned. We had no ranged heroes.\n\n- Gloin had little impact beyond stats, his ability not really being used.\n\n- We had spirit cards in the Aragorn deck and Eowyn deck. We could cancel some things and played Unexpected Courage, but weren't held back by spirit's weakness in combat.\n\n\n\nAgain, we completed the last three stages in three turns, so losing Beravor for example wasn't a huge deal as she'd been used to the near-max as it was. We probably finished with 4-5 locations in staging.\n\n\n\n@ Kobby\n\nYour Leadership/Tactics deck has 15/50 cards that cost four or more. That seems a touch steep with all the other cards plays like Sneak Attack and Feint being a priority as well.\nI understand that some times you need to 'even out the draw' by having plenty of high cost cards for times when you seem to just build resources with no way to use them.\nIn Osgiliath, I feel you need a large amount of allies because of Cut Off. An early ally can also remove Wolves from Mordor.\n\nI wonder if The Galadhrim's Greeting is maybe too expensive in Osgiliath. With all the doomed and cards that add doomed, I wonder if you're paying for something that just holds threat back for a short while rather than reducing your threat for multiple turns.\n\nMy group's decks were far from perfection, but possibly played to perfection! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\nI'm interested to see if we can do it again on a different draw and see if our combat version or the spirit version you have works better. (Generally spirit seems to be the dominant sphere in the LotR LCG right now!)\n\n\n\nThanks for reading.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55514-some-thoughts-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=556480","commentId":556480,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1321414207,"content":"Congrats!\n\nI have never done Osgiliath with 3 players but I had thought it would be nearing impossibility as I noticed how much harder it is to beat with 2 players than solo. I can honestly say I am beating it with the above deck (clearly) more than I lose to it but in a coop we struggle to win once in five attempts. And I feel it gets worse.\n\nYou're totally right about Dunhere. He can be great but he needs a total commitment, I mean in a coop, he would need the other deck to compliment him as well. Perhaps I shall do such a deck just to prove he's worth it in a coop, too. Here, in solo games, he really rocks, at least in the beginning, if I don't get Rangers I let him guard the crossing at the river, the finale is doable with Eowyn and Theodred.\n\nAgain, well done doing this 3-playered. Boromir and Imrahil might really shine in this one, if the company survives the opening. Those first two rounds are (as often) quite crucial, I feel.\n\n[edit] Have you had Dunedain Cache? I think it is a card to have in such cases. The Gondorians would benefit greatly from it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55514-some-thoughts-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=556510","commentId":556510,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1321421963,"content":"I would be interested to see your 3 player deck you used.

I had Dunhere at 7+ attack at one point, destroying enemies in the staging area, however, he has problems...\n\n(No doubt you'd be aware of these... I don't know the answer is more my point.)\n\n- in multi-player games you're team mates are going to have varying threat levels and draw out enemies you'd probably rather leave in staging.\n- on the flip side, there are more cards coming up, so more chance you're going to see higher threat level enemies.\n\n- you need to be able to pass and get other players to optionally assign enemies that you would otherwise face. This isn't exactly cool on your teams part, and sometimes it can mean they are getting nowhere, defending constantly with no attacking back.\n- Wandering Took can really help here as you can provide a warm body for a team mate who's taking your attack while also making assignment easier.\n\n- some times its kind of hard to decide what to do with him. Should I quest because he may not have an attack option? If i'm not taking enemies because of Dunhere, what do my other heroes do in regard to attacking, etc.\n\n\nI really like him as I feel somewhat bored with spirit as they don't seem to have much teeth, but also, I don't want to be the puppet master type playing all the time, jumping in with cancel, etc.\nHe needs a lot of focus. Fortunately, he could just generally fit into a Rohan deck regardless of his ability. He would be great to move an enemy that has been attacked back into staging, with A Light in the Dark, and have Dunhere finish him off but I think the FAQ mentions that each enemy can be attacked once, not once per player's engagement area.\n\n\n\nThe above is somewhat off topic, however, knowing what enemies are going to pop-up in Osgiliath does help Dunhere. I think he could work well with an early Gondorian Spearman.\n\n\n\n@ booored\n\nWe didn't build cohesive decks. Outside of not doubling up on heroes, we don't confer about anything in advance.\nWhen making choices to play cards though, we do attach Unexpected Courage, Protector of Lorien, etc, to the best choice on the table. (Even Steward of Gondor at times.)\n\n\n\nMy deck was;\n\nPrince Imrahil\nBeravor\nTheodred\n\n\n3 Common Cause (Imrahil readies Beravor)\n3 Campfire Tales\n3 Ever Vigilant (ready Gleowine)\n3 Sneak Attack (Gandalf, draw 3)\n3 Valiant Sacrifice\n3 Gleowine\n2 Gandalf's Search (can always draw 1)\n\n3 Keen-eyed Took (not sure if REALLY helps drawing, but there to activate Imrahil and Valiant Sacrifice too)\n\n2 Protector of Lorien (can arguably not send Beravor questing, then use her to draw and add two to Protector to effectively quest after the fact)\n\n3 Gandalf\n\n23 other cards, mostly a toolbox approach.\n\nSometimes you can draw and/or have 12 cards in your hand which can destroy 3B for some quests when combined with Protector of Lorien.\n\nYou can occasionally dig for cards like healing when the game turns sour, or Sneak Attack combos, Landroval being a favourite as a way of healing as well as pretty handy through Osgiliath.\n\nI had planned on using Keen-eyed Took with Erebor Hammersmith but I soon realised that if you don't play and return Keen-eyed Took on the same turn, you have no idea what you're next card is!\nThat being said, the Took was played when I was the first player, allowing another player to see they had a Gondorian Spearmen as their next draw, Beravor giving them that card and allowing them to play it in the Planning phase, killing a Wolves from Mordor!\n\n\nI had a different version using Unexpected Courage and Westfold Horse-breaker, but found that leadership resources were a bit scarce.\nSneak Attack, Gandalf, Ever Vigilant/Valiant Sacrifice being the main leadership combo.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55514-some-thoughts-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=556540","commentId":556540,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1321426815,"content":"Thanks for the discussion. Your points are very valid. I would love to combine the Rohan deck with an Eagle deck that deals with the staging area, based around Descendant of Thorondor (and even Beorning Beekeeper perhaps). I have tried Thalin only once or twice and never liked it.\n\nI know it was not me who was asked but I can provide heroes of the three decks that perform quite well against the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. But have not tried Osgiliath like that.\n\nRohan Deck: Dunhere, Eowyn, Theodred (obviously)\n\nNorthern Deck: Glorfindel, Beravor, Frodo Baggins\n\nGondor Deck: Boromir, Eleanor, Prince Imrahil (quite fun but low on questing)\n\nThe first two quest well, can draw and get rid of locations, the third fights well and boosts resources, and can help others questing with Faramir."}]}
