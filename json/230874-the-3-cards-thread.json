I explain:\n\n \n\nThere are some webs that comment new cards (for example, TftC, or even this forum...) but there is not any exact order, or the reader need to read a lot of paragraphs.\n\nHow about if you could display your thinks in just 3 words? It will be fast to read all the comments, and you could comment your thinkings fast too.\n\n \n\nThis is why i say it is a friendly thread. Sometimes i will post the news spoilers, and people can comment them with just 3 words. Just telling the name of 3 cards (well, it is allowed to post a PD short, if someone wants, but not necessary). 3 cards can give the readers a lot of thinkings..., and it is friendly.\n\n \n\nLet's go! To start i will show 2 cards for examples, you can comments them (with just 3 name of cards ^^):\n\n \n\nmec51_marksmanoflorien.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/a1/f4/a1f43de2-5df7-4701-bfe8-8bff5df6874a/mec51_marksmanoflorien.png]\n\n \n\nThe 3 cards i name are:\n\n1. Straigth Shot\n\n2. Rivendel Blade\n\n3. Hands Upon the Bow\n\n \n\nIt gives you a lot of ideas, isn't? Dont tell which... just think and write 3 cards more cards (if you want to repeat some it is ok, why not)\n\nEdited September 24, 2016 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230874-the-3-cards-thread/?do=findComment&comment=2428936","commentId":2428936,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1474729233,"content":"The second example is the famous Seastan's Anborn, here is:\n\n \n\nYTG4BSE.jpg [http://i.imgur.com/YTG4BSE.jpg]\n\n \n\nThe list:\n\n1.
