I think it's clear that in your example that the card is reducing your threat. The reason is on the card itself - you get an extra effect if the card raises your threat. If the card can raise your threat, then it can also reduce it.\n\nPresumably the reason the word reduce isn't on the card is because it can do either, unlike other similar cards that set threat to certain amounts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307995-saruman-pillars-of-the-kings-reducing-threat/?do=findComment&comment=3931456","commentId":3931456,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1587971464,"content":"> 8 hours ago, Fantasty said:\n> \n> My gut tells me that setting is fundamentally different from reducing, so it would still be set to 40.

It doesn't do anything else. In other words, it's just irrelevant to the question (which was\" does \"set\" count as \"reduce\").\n\nEdited April 27 by GrandSpleen"}]}
