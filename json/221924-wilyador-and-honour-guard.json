Yes, Honour Guard can cancel damage to Wilyador even if Rhosgobel is in play, and he doesn't get removed from the game because he \"cancelled damage\" instead of \"healing\" Wilyador. With two in play, you cancel all damage from its forced effect and with more you cancel damage from the treacheries."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221924-wilyador-and-honour-guard/?do=findComment&comment=2254072","commentId":2254072,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1465233284,"content":"Thank you.  I was sure the question was already asked, but I couldn't find the answer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221924-wilyador-and-honour-guard/?do=findComment&comment=2255058","commentId":2255058,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1465273740,"content":"Yeah, Honour Guards + Distant Stars really break this quest, even in NM."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221924-wilyador-and-honour-guard/?do=findComment&comment=2255065","commentId":2255065,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1465274124,"content":"Ah, I didn't think about Distant Stars - you can grab forest grove and repeat it to rob the Athelas, and then speed the questing.\n\n \n\nidk if I consider these things \"broken\" since I'm doing this pure solo.  Getting through the encounter deck to find objectives takes a lot of time...\n\nEdited June 7, 2016 by shosuko"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221924-wilyador-and-honour-guard/?do=findComment&comment=2255777","commentId":2255777,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1465312920,"content":"\"rob the Athelas\"\n\nI love it!"}]}
