Nor should his Forced text be active while he is out of play anyway.\n\nI don't definitively know the answer to whether he retains the progress tokens on him when he's set aside by 3A, although I suspect he does. But does it matter?\n\nEdited August 13 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310472-the-lonely-mountain-questions/?do=findComment&comment=3973870","commentId":3973870,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1597329475,"content":"For an illustrative comparison, Thing in the Depths has a quest card effect that places tokens on set-aside, out-of-play encounter cards… But it explicitly refers to those cards not being in play, so that's how it \"works\":\n\nhttp://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Take-the-Ship-TTiTD [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Take-the-Ship-TTiTD]"}]}
