I don't explicitly look through all the cards, but I do read all of the articles and comments online so I usually have some ideas of what to expect.

What does this menacing looking treachery do, the artwork of Sauron‘s Eye makes me fear the worst. \n\nI also read the previews by FFG so I have a basic knowledge what the quest is about. After playing this game for years you also get to know some of FFGs „tricks“: Get a Choice where one option is much easier (e.g. shuffling Nazguls into the deck in a Knife in the dark)?
