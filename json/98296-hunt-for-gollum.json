Because I wanted Elrond, and that's it.\n\nSo my advice is to browse through the APs and select one you like for the player cards & quest.\n\nOnly for the AtS cycle will I recommend playing (not buying mind you) the quests in order for the story.\n\nIn the earlier quests the adventures do link, but on a far more shallow level, so IMO it's not that important.\n\nSo wait for a reprint, and buy some other pack is my advice.\n\nAlso, http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com [http://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com] has some great articles to get started on buying packs.\n\nTo browse the database on cards in a pack I recommend http://hallofbeorn.com [http://hallofbeorn.com]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98296-hunt-for-gollum/?do=findComment&comment=986893","commentId":986893,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1392593940,"content":"Yeah... just buy the packs that are available.

That card search is bad. You can not separate your game text search from other fields. It is a complete fail. Any search gives you a billion cards.
