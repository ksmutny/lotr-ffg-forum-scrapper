It can be pretty powerful. This is what made Thror's Map almost broken before it got errata. Strider's Path is good at the beginning of game when there is no active location, otherwise, it is just helpful to avoid travel effects and possibly exchange active location for a lower threat one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105486-striders-path/?do=findComment&comment=1074346","commentId":1074346,"userName":"tacomen253","timestamp":1399394673,"content":"Strider's Path is a great card in the lore sphere for location management. I am a huge fan of it when I face encounter decks with around a half dozen location cards with nasty Travel effects. But if they are just locations without much Travel effects then I agree with awp823, Secret Paths [http://hallofbeorn.com/HallOfBeorn_deploy/Cards/Details/Secret-Paths-Core] may be your better option. I will actually be seeking Secret Paths today while scouting through The Long Dark.\n\n \n\nOh is this not the Strategy Thread? ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\nEdited May 6, 2014 by tacomen253"}]}
