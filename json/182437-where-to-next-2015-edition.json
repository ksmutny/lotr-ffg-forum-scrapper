Additionally, perhaps quests could also be influenced by whether or not the player(s) had completed certain side quests in previous scenarios. When side quests were originally revealed, I'd thought that they might have do this. I.E. - if you complete side quest X you gain some benefit on the main quest and potentially in a future quest. I think either Into Ithillien or Siege of Cair Andros has a mechanic similiar to this. Obviously this could be tricky to implement, as others have mentioned."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182437-where-to-next-2015-edition/?do=findComment&comment=1707344","commentId":1707344,"userName":"bubblepopmei","timestamp":1438116576,"content":"I used to play the Middle Earth CCG and Alatar was my favourite wizard.
