Flight of the Stormcaller delivered several missing pieces for both Gondor and Noldor, so I understood the impact of the cards all at once. This pack is all over the place:\n\n * Equipment of War is just a versatile Tactics attachment. Maybe a better attachment than the Gondorian Shield for those 3D 3HP characters like Denethor and Amarthiul?\n * Lanwyn and the Woodman ally develop the Scout trait a little bit, but there's not much synergy there yet so they're basically just a new hero and a location control card.\n * Sam and Elevensies fill in some missing holes for Hobbit decks. Sam is another unique ally to Sword-Thain to pump up Pippin's and Merry's abilities, as well as some development for the subtheme of raising threat that several of the Spirit hobbit heroes do. Elevensies is another much-needed threat-reduction event to make Hobbit Pipes a little more viable.\n * Eldahir is another expensive Dunedain ally, he grants a little shadow scrying.\n * Master Blacksmith seems like a combo-enabling card--I like the idea of using him to get out-of-sphere attachments down.\n * Captain's Wisdom is even more resource generation in Leadership.\n * Tireless Guard reminds me of Power in the Earth to be honest.\n\n \n\nSince it's kind of a shotgun of a small amount of support for lots of things, I think it feels like it has a smaller impact, but I think that most of these will see play--just not all in the same deck.\n\n \n\nNot sure about Tireless Guard though. Exhausting a Scout or Ranger every round to give a location -2? Can anyone think of a place where that card would be useful?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2232755","commentId":2232755,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1464110450,"content":"I think part of the reason for the underwhelm is that I the best cards in this pack are mostly the ones which were already spoiled in advance.

This is 100% because it can go on allies as well as heroes. \n\nThey do have to have the warrior trait but I can think of several great targets for this attachment.\n\nFirst one that comes to mind is the ally version of Gimli. Gimli already has sentinel, 2 defense and 3 hitpoints and whats more he has an inbuilt readying effect so that he can both quest and attack/defend. With War Equipment he becomes a 4 defense, 5 hitpoints defender with sentinel. This is pretty impressive. He would also have 3 attack which would make him insanely flexible and an extremely good all round ally. Quest with him each round, ready him from his effect then he either defends or attacks like a champion at more or less the same level/stats that a hero would. \nIt works extremely well on Hama or Gamling turning both into 4 defense 4 hitpoint walls.\n\nPossibly the best receiver is the Gondorian Spearman we have had since the core set. Yes he can only do 1 point of damage while defending rather then the 2 he could do if he had spear of the citadel attached HOWEVER with war equipment he is a 3 defence, 3 hitpoint ally and will actually be able to survive attacks of up to 5 attack strength rather than dying the second an enemy attack has 2 or more attack strength. If this is not extremely useful I don't know what is!\n\nDefender of Rammas becomes a 6 defense, 3 hitpoint defending machine and his number 1 weakness (1 hitpoint) is removed. \n\nDefender of the Naith becomes a bit more playable/useful. \nHenneth Annun Guard is another great recipient for this attachment and becomes a decent defender this way as well. \n\nWarden of Helms deep becomes a 5 defense, 4 hitpoint wall with sentinel. \n\nIt is also fantastic on Guardian of Rivendell.\nLongbeard Sentry becomes a much better defender.....\n\nPretty much any ally with the warrior trait that is normally used to defend OR could become a much better defender with +2 def and +2 hitpoints is a fantastic recipient for this attachment. This attachment is amazing for decks that utilise allies as defenders more so than heroes or really any decks that use several of the allies mentioned above. \n\nIts actually not bad on Tactics Aragorn either as it puts him at 4 attack, 4 defense and 7 hitpoints. Due to his in built ability that reduces enemy armour higher attack is not really as important and War Equipment turns him into a very capable defender while also buffing his attack a little. So long as he is not your main or only offensive hero/option he makes a fantastic emergency defender.\n\nEdited May 25, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2233746","commentId":2233746,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1464150483,"content":">  \n> \n> If Tireless Guard really doesn’t have a limit, then it could prove especially useful on 4-threat (or more) locations that you don’t want to travel to.

You say the vowels in Balin and Dáin are not comparable, but I'm saying they are. The fact that people pronounce \"ai\" differently from \"ali\" is precisely because they transport the English pronunciation of the diphthong \"ai\" to Tolkien (in this case Dwarvish) language, which is an incorrect assumption. We should not assume that the diphthong is pronounced in the English way for other languages. As far as I know, Dwarvish vowels (in this case A) don't have so many different sounds as they do in English (as in \"cat\" and \"day\"), but just one: \"ah\" (as in Balin or \"rat\"). In pretty much any other language (thinking of Greek, Italian and Spanish), the sounds of the vowels in Dain and Balin are both the same.\n\n \n\nTo put it simply, the fact that you say that \"ai\" and \"ali\" are pronounced differently is because you're thinking in English. In most European languages, the \"l\" in between is irrelevant to the sound of the vowels. \n\n \n\nOf course, I am ommitting the accent on the a, which does mess up the pronunciation. Master of Lore's article pretty much seals the deal, I was just saying people give Tolkien languages the rules of English, which they should not do.\n\n \n\nI'll still be saying Dine though.\n\nEdited June 1, 2016 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2244743","commentId":2244743,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1464815467,"content":">  because you're thinking in English.\n\n \n\nI cannot refute this logic.   ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2244749","commentId":2244749,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1464815627,"content":"> https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-to-pronounce-dain-ironfoot/ [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/07/13/how-to-pronounce-dain-ironfoot/]\n> \n> [drop the mic and walk away]\n\n \n\nFrom that article: \n\nThe only certainly wrong answer is the one used by the Dwarves in Peter Jackson’s Hobbit film adaption.  Dáin is not “Dane” as this ignores both Tolkien’s direction on diphthongs [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diphthong] and acute accents [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_accent], both of which apply to Mr. Ironfoot.  Apologies to an HBO stand-up comedian, you do not share a first name with the King Under the Mountain."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2244840","commentId":2244840,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1464820179,"content":"> Pretty sure it's \"dine\".

Just stall on Stage 1 without travelling to the Helm for 10+ rounds, or however long it takes you to get Boromir fully set up with a ton of resources. Then travel to the helm, defend the Corsairs with Boromir+Blood of Numenor. Next round burn through the Helm and the quest with a couple Lay of Nimrodels. The Corsairs will join your team and you will have a fully set up Boromir to deal with the tentacles.\n\n \n\nI do like the punishment for stalling that the developers built into the quest, but I think a deck that can muster a ton of willpower can twist it to its advantage.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?do=findComment&comment=2276349","commentId":2276349,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1466527612,"content":"What Boromir variants have you found to be good for solo, Seastan?
