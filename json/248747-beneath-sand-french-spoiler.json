It seem more powerful to me this way ;).\n\nLike 13nrv says it work well with Eleanor and Merry. At least with 4 players table, because with only one or two players this won't work a lot. But it seem cool but not overpowered to replace every treachery you want with a 3-cards combo. When you play Eleanor there is numerous time when you don't want to use her ability.
