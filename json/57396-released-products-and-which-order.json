I just loved it and will certainly play a lot more the coming time. I've played the Decipher TCG for years but it's been slowly dying around here and I only rarely play with 4 friends.\n\nWhat I love so far is the ability to play solo as well and that it is cooperative so my wife might like to play as well. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nBut with christmas and birthdays coming up i've been wondering about the other already released sets and upcoming sets.\nI live in the Netherlands and there are no shops nearby so I have to buy online. No problem, but I can't find the proper order to buy new expansions. I've made up a list of what I think is correct, but can anyone please tell me if i'm right?\n\nThis is the list I created:\n\nCore set\n\n1. Shadows of Mirkwood\n- The Hunt for Gollum Adventure Pack\n- Conflict at the Carrock\n- A Journey to Rhosgobel\n- The Hills of Emyn Muil\n- The Dead Marshes\n- Return to Mirkwood\n\n2 The Massing at Osgiliath\n\n3 Khazad-dûm Expansion\n\n4 Dwarrowdelf\n- The Redhorn Gate\n- Road to Rivendell\n- The Watcher in the Water\n\nThanks in advance!\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57396-released-products-and-which-order/?do=findComment&comment=566063","commentId":566063,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1323500791,"content":"The list is correct.\n\nJust for clarification: In order to play any Mirkwood Cycle AP you need the encounter cards from the core set, samewise for Dwarrowdelf for which you will need Khazad-Dum. Massing at Osgiliath is a stand alone/print on demand pack which doesnt need any other encounter cards (it also doesnt include any player cards)"}]}
