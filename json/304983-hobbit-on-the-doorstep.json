They're terrible, (even when it comes to player card design, mostly) and while the rest of the saga boxes and deluxes are great, Hobbit hits the all time low and should get a remake one day.\n\nThe quests are so specifically fiddly and require not simple teching or building a deck having something in mind - there are two quests which require certain costs and card types in mind. \n\nOther quests operate on extremely swingy spectrum of luck, moreso than any others of the game. I think battle of five armies was the only good one and flies and spiders was almost salvagable. But the quests feel gimmicky, cards swingy, have weird relation to the theme (lotr saga keeps it thematic and mechanics are organic, hobbit sagas theme and mechanics don't feel so close). The campaign in hobbit is awkward, feels like beta testing for lotr. \n\nThe trolls, smaug and riddles are not quests i ever want to play again. Just get easy mode, beat them once, forget them and move on to anything else. Everything you noticed about the quests with the treasures and smaug wipe is valid.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304983-hobbit-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=3879501","commentId":3879501,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1580053035,"content":"There actually is something that can be done about the Smaug/burglar shadows -- discard them.  At the time of release only Dawn Takes You All would do that, but now Staff of Lebethren, Gandalf's Staff, and Armored Destrier (with a non-Smaug enemy around to defend against first) can provide consistent protection against re-attacks. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304983-hobbit-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=3879637","commentId":3879637,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1580072215,"content":"Hmm, looks like most people agree with what I was saying.  Wasn't expecting that lol.  Maybe it shows I'm finally \"getting\" the game.  I've been playing about a year and a half, but I still feel pretty green.  Probably comes from playing solo.\n\nI'm not fond of these \"fiddly\" scenarios.  I look forward to playing a new one and seeing what challenges it presents, and then bam there's some completely new mechanic I have to learn.  A little irritating.  Okay, yes, I'm lazy.\n\n \n\n> 5 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> There actually is something that can be done about the Smaug/burglar shadows -- discard them.  At the time of release only Dawn Takes You All would do that\n\nThat's interesting, I hadn't considered that.  Only works a maximum of three times, but that could make all the difference."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304983-hobbit-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=3879927","commentId":3879927,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1580130352,"content":"> 21 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> There actually is something that can be done about the Smaug/burglar shadows -- discard them.  At the time of release only Dawn Takes You All would do that, but now Staff of Lebethren, Gandalf's Staff, and Armored Destrier (with a non-Smaug enemy around to defend against first) can provide consistent protection against re-attacks. \n\nRider of the Mark was also around at the time of release, but that only works in multiplayer.

One significant note here: it's only the Baggins resource effect on The Lonely Mountain which changes the card you have to match - if you use any other card draw effect it doesn't, so you can look at the card, then trigger e.g. Gleowine to draw that card into your hand, and then discard it to the Burgle test as a perfect match for itself.\n\nBeyond that, there's not much demand for combat, so you mostly just need willpower - in particular willpower boosts can be more helpful than just spamming lots of allies, since Smaug the Golden's threat increases as you quest with more characters.\n\nI suppose it's also worth noting that you don't *have* to take all the treasures if you don't want to, so if you'd prefer you can push through more quickly, in which case you don't need to be as built for the Burgle tests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304983-hobbit-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=3880825","commentId":3880825,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1580229176,"content":"> 20 hours ago, Vince79 said:\n> \n> Before that, I was using them to dig all my treasure out of the deck before doing anything else.\n\nWell you should certainly search up the magic ring to get the Baggins resources flowing, but the others aren't as useful in this quest so you don't really need to."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304983-hobbit-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=3880960","commentId":3880960,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1580239086,"content":"> 3 hours ago, PocketWraith said:\n> \n> you can look at the card, then trigger e.g. Gleowine to draw that card into your hand, and then discard it to the Burgle test as a perfect match for itself.\n\nI wouldn't have thought of that, is that legal?\n\nI usually play these scenarios \"blind\" the first time, and this is a case where it definitely cost me.  If I would have studied the encounter cards before playing, I would have realized there aren't really any bad enemies in this quest, aside from Smaug of course.  You're right, willpower is huge in this one.  But I like starting out blind, without knowing what's coming.  Makes it seem more like an adventure, even if it costs me wins. \n\n> 2 hours ago, rees263 said:\n> \n> Well you should certainly search up the magic ring to get the Baggins resources flowing, but the others aren't as useful in this quest so you don't really need to.\n\nI usually get Sting out first thing to buff Bilbo's stats (a little).  The Magic Ring I usually use to absorb one of Smaug the Magnificent's attacks.  Maybe I need to collect some resources though, there have been a few cases where I've needed them and didn't have them.  Aside from willpower, threat reduction comes in handy for this quest.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304983-hobbit-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=3881904","commentId":3881904,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1580330249,"content":"Was able to get a win against The Lonely Mountain at last, after several retweaks of the deck.  The key for me was to intentionally not burgle successfully too quickly, while working on a massive buildup.  The Dawn Takes You All card was a big help since I had a couple of them in my hand, and that kept Smaug at bay long enough to quest out the final card.  Then put some damage on Smaug and it was over.\n\nThese difficult quests annoy me, but it is satisfying to defeat them.  Usually it just takes finding the right key, the right combination of deck and strategy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304983-hobbit-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=3883150","commentId":3883150,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1580455466,"content":"Got another win against The Lonely Mountain, so I'll be moving on to Battle of Five Armies.  Henamarth Riversong can be a real key to winning against this quest, so you can mulligan for him if you need to.  If you know exactly what the threat in the staging area is going to be, you can match it exactly.  That will prevent you from having to make burgle attempts when you don't want to, which also prevents attacks from Smaug the Golden.  \n\nThis last game was a very long slog (got rerouted through 4A), but I again had a massive buildup so was able to get a win fairly easily at the end."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304983-hobbit-on-the-doorstep/?do=findComment&comment=3883187","commentId":3883187,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1580461587,"content":"I've never even tried to win the Lonely Mountain by killing Smaug (saved that for The Battle of Laketown).
