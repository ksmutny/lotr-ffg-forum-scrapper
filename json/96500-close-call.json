I tried to stress the point in the preview thread but since there was no answer and I am eager to be sure, I do it again: those of you confident with rules, do you think Close Call can be used to cancel damage otherwise dealt to hero Beorn?

Especially as we've been told the older concepts should not die. Well, one of the concepts are mono-sphere decks. And that should mean that one is to be competitive with any of the four mono decks, including solo play. As it is, mono-Tactics cannot win many games, especially outside the HoN and AtS. That needs to change. I know it is not easy to maintain the uniqueness but it is certainly possible. A card like Close Call is a very good step, since (together with the Gondorian Discipline) it provides a way to cancel damage, and it is nice in many ways: it does keep the distinction between spheres (Lore has healing, Tactics has prevention, Spirit has retrieval) and gives Tactics some edge. The next step should be more card draw (Foe-Hammer alone is not enough, especially till we have more weapons, we still have very few) and especially threat reduction.\n\n \n\nAs for the latter it could be something of the like: \"if you have this or that, you won't have to raise your threat after questing unsuccessfully,\" or \"if you do this or that this round, you won't have to raise your threat in the re-fresh phase.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96500-close-call/?do=findComment&comment=1260022","commentId":1260022,"userName":"raven614","timestamp":1410548379,"content":"So with close call the damage never happens?
