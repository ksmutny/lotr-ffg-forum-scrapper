(i believe i mentioned it here, but not sure)\n\n \n\nThe card should be number #121, the only missing number on that particular pack (it starts with the hero card #116 - Dain Ironfoot - as all packs/expansions).\n\n \n\nThe order is, usually:\n\n- Hero card(s);\n\nBy spheres (Leadership, Tactics, Spirit, Lore and Neutral)\n\nAlly card;\n\nEvent card; *\n\nAttachment card; *\n\nQuest cards;\n\nEncounter cards; (there seems to be no particular order on this, except for the fact that the cards are grouped on the encounter set. ex all locations cards, then all enemy cards, then all treachery cards)\n\n \n\n* Some packs have the attachments cards before the event cards (THfG; CatC; AJtR; RtM; KD; RtR; TH:OHaUH)\n\nPS: On the Hobbit expansions they put it all together (all ally cards, all event cards and all attachment cards) mantaining the spheres order."}]}
