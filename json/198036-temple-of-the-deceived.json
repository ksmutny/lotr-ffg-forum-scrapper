So I'd essentially be using a fair number of spaces in my deck to ensure that I'd have a good number of Scout allies in play (and possibly using up a hero slot or two), all for the purpose of using a single card, which simply boosts the willpower of some cards that don't really have great willpower in and of themselves: why not just build a deck with some higher willpower questers? In my opinion, it's just not achieving much, although I'm sure that the occasional final quest push aided by Scouting Party would be quite epic.\n\n \n\nI think that if Scouting Party costed less, I wouldn't be so harsh on it, but then, once the Scout trait is developed a bit more and it starts to become a viable deck type, it could well be that Scouting Party proves to be worth the two resources and the deck space. For me, though, this time is not very close at all, so I still don't see myself considering it for inclusion in any decks for some time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/198036-temple-of-the-deceived/?do=findComment&comment=1980224","commentId":1980224,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1452340343,"content":"The scout trait has pretty decent willpower.

Why not just build a deck with some higher willpower questers? The answer is simple: the game is not about winning it, it's about winning it in a lot of different ways, so different people can build different decks and still win. You don't enjoy Scout stuff?
