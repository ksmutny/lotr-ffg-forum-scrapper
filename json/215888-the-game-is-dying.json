From its inception the game has been a near-constant presence on the Board Game Geek The Hotness list. Our local Austin LotR group has been growing again and has been going strong for years. I and other blog-writers in the community continue to receive correspondence from new players who have found the game, and love it just as we do. Still, this is all a sure sign that FFG will discontinue the game at any minute. It’s the only logical thing for them to do with such a popular game.\"\n\nEdited April 1, 2016 by Rajam"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/215888-the-game-is-dying/?do=findComment&comment=2144051","commentId":2144051,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1459505619,"content":"Also, clearly the main problem is that people is asking for a Tauriel hero and FFG can't release it due to copyright stuff.

I feel like every collectible game I've ever played, there are those in the player community who are convinced the company running it is terrible, doesn't care about the product, or is just about to close up shop on the game, so this did a great job of that.
