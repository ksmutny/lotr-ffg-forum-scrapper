You should rather think of the proof of purchase as a serial-number of your game. If pieces are missing or there is some damage you will need it to claim replacements. If anything is in order you might not need it, but I guess it's still better to hold on to it ;-)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45966-proof-of-purchase/?do=findComment&comment=460974","commentId":460974,"userName":"DerBarchen","timestamp":1304070484,"content":"Its a relatively new service it seems, the Thrones core set I bought last christmas didnt have a proof of purchase. I really hope its something more exciting than just a troubleshooting number.
