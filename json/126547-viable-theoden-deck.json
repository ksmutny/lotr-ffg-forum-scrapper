Building a good deck around him has been tough but I finally built one that really shows just how amazing he can be. To be honest solo the deck doesn't work as well because a lack of essential leadership abilities. Overall though I have beat the whole HoN cycle and expansion. Which I found most interesting because I did not change 1 card in my decks and had no trouble alternating between siege, battle and normal questing which is something that can generally cause a bit of trouble.\n\n \n\nFirst deck, Heores - Theoden, Mablung, Glorfindel\n\n \n\nAllies 21\n\n \n\nVassal of the Windlord x3\n\nWinged Guardian x3\n\nDescendant of Thorondor x2\n\nLandroval x1\n\nGwaihir x1\n\nEagles of the Misty Mountains x3\n\nWestfold Outrider x2\n\nBlue Mountain Trader x1\n\nWestfold Horse Breeder x2\n\nRiddermarks Finest x1\n\nArwen Undomiel x1\n\n \n\nAttachment 15\n\n \n\nUnexpected Courage x1\n\nSupport of the Eagles x2\n\nBow of the Galadhrim x2\n\nRivendell Blade x2\n\nSteed of the Mark x3\n\nBlack Arrow x1\n\nLight of Valinor x3\n\n \n\nEvents 15\n\nElrond's Council x3\n\nFeint x2\n\nThe Eagles Are Coming x3\n\nA Test of Will x3\n\nFoe Hammer x3\n\nThe Galadhrim's Greeting x1\n\n \n\nDeck 2 Heroes Theodred, Beravor, Haldir\n\n \n\nAllies 16\n\n \n\nGandalf Core x3\n\nFaramir x1\n\nMaster of the Forge x1\n\nGleowine x1\n\nGaladhrim Minstrel x1\n\nWarden of Healing x2\n\nHennamarth Riversong x1\n\nPelagrir Ship Captain x1\n\nDori x1\n\nElrond x2\n\nGaladriel x1\n\nGildor Inglorien x1\n\n \n\nAttachments 15\n\n \n\nAsfaloth x2\n\nWingfoot x3\n\nSteward of Gondor x3\n\nCelebrian's Stone x1\n\nProtector of Lorien x2\n\nThror's Map x2\n\nLembas x2\n\nCram x2\n\n \n\nEvents 18\n\nSneak Attack x3\n\nLoriens Wealth x2\n\nMithrandir's Advice x3\n\nTighten our Belts x2\n\nSecret Paths x2\n\nCampfire Tales x3\n\nStriders Path x2\n\nRadagasts Cunning x1 \n\n \n\nBasically I attach Steed of the Mark to Mablung and Theoden and with SoG and Mablung's resource generation plus Theodred I never lack for resources on them. Between the two tactics heroes they can pay for all the expensive Eagle allies and Support of the Eagles really buffs up their power. With Steed of the Mark and LoV I can quest for 9 and have all 3 of those heroes still ready for combat.\n\nThe second deck is basically a support deck that basically has everything the other deck lacks. Card draw, healing location management.  \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126547-viable-theoden-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1325019","commentId":1325019,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1415308656,"content":"Nice deck :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  You might want to post in the deck building section though so people can find it later when looking for decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126547-viable-theoden-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1325150","commentId":1325150,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1415315684,"content":"Wow, nice decks!!

Therefore you need access to other spheres to ready the tactics heroes and get full use of their mainly combat abilities. When tactics Aragorn comes out I will substitute him for Glorfindel and add a spirit hero to the other deck probably replacing Haldir. This way I could have a tri-sphere tactics deck that could quest at 9 and once all the attachments are in place fight like beasts!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126547-viable-theoden-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1325410","commentId":1325410,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1415335449,"content":"I like Theoden a lot too, and like you I've had trouble making a reliable deck with him in it.  However, I did choose him when going to the Fellowship Event, and beat the Fog on the Barrow-downs quest in a 2-player game.  Theoden-Eomer-Merry for a nice thematic deck, along with a Gandalf-Aragorn(Lo)-Glorfindel(Sp) deck that my partner had."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126547-viable-theoden-deck/?do=findComment&comment=1325435","commentId":1325435,"userName":"MightyRauros","timestamp":1415337842,"content":"I find him useful when I don't need large questing all the time, but need an occasional push (combined with one or two 2+ willpower Tactics heroes). He's a good defender and attacker the rest of the time. I honestly just love using him and never really see him a hindrance. "}]}
