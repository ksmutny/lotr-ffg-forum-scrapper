The description on 2B is: \"If there are no Troll enemies left in play, or if there are no cards left in the encounter deck, advance to the next stage.\"\n\n \n\nWhat confused me was that I defeated the trolls before being able to discard all encounter cards. Was I able to move on to 3A after that last troll was defeated, or do I still have to discard all encounter cards? The 1 progress on the card is what confuses me because you must complete all progress on the quest before moving on (as well as finishing off any other objectives). But instead of putting progress on the quest card, you have to discard the equal amount of encounter cards. \n\n \n\nSo, in short... If you defeat the Trolls first, can you move on to 3A of the quest, ignoring that 1 progress on 2B?\n\n \n\nHope this makes sense to all of you, I don't know what to make of it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88412-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day-2b/?do=findComment&comment=839142","commentId":839142,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1376434144,"content":"this is the text\n\n\"If there are no Troll enemies left in play, or if there are no cards left in the encounter deck, advance to the next stage.\"\n\n \n\nso the two parts can be split into\n\n \n\nIf there are no Troll enemies left in play\n\n \n\nor\n\n \n\nif there are no cards left in the encounter deck\n\n \n\nso if either of those parts of met, then the final part happens....\n\n \n\nadvance to the next stage.\n\n \n\nso taking it the 'or' there literally, then as soon as the trolls leave play, you advance\n\nrich\n\nEdited August 13, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88412-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day-2b/?do=findComment&comment=839225","commentId":839225,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1376439629,"content":"Yup.  Either survive til the sun comes up (no cards left in the encounter deck), or defeat the trolls before that happens (no trolls in play).  Don't have to do both!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88412-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day-2b/?do=findComment&comment=839241","commentId":839241,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1376441137,"content":"this first time i won this i just used o elbereth gilthoniel for get rid of most of the trolls. it wasnt an exciting quest, but it was a win :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88412-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day-2b/?do=findComment&comment=839353","commentId":839353,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1376453029,"content":"How do you defeat all the trolls cuz the one says \"trolls engaged with a player cannot take damage\" do you really have to use quick strike, yew bow, dunhere ect?  Or am I missing something?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88412-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day-2b/?do=findComment&comment=839354","commentId":839354,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1376453143,"content":"Trolls NOT engaged with a player!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88412-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day-2b/?do=findComment&comment=839356","commentId":839356,"userName":"PatrickJHarvey","timestamp":1376453862,"content":"Thanks for the answer, that cleared things up!

The whole thing that makes it complicated is that you can't make any progress. I think I'll play it like when the trolls are dead I'll play one last round and make progress. That seems the right thing to do. Don't know how I would do about it if the encounter deck runs out first. Maybe I should just just correct the 1 progress needed to a 0.\n\nThat's the only frustrating I find with this game. There's too much depending on the exact phrasing of words. It should just be plain and easy to understand. Not require you to really think about how everything should be read every time you play a quest. I haven't played one single game yet where I was 100% sure if I interpreted all the cards right. And that's just it. INTERPRETED. It shouldn't be a possibility to interpret the cards. A should just mean A all the time. Not \"possibly\" meaning A but a slight risk it might be B or even C depending on circumstances.
