If FFG announced an iOS version of this game with the ability to add expansions as they were released I would order my new iPad within minutes of reading the announcement.

Just think about how many moments per turn you could do something. That would be quite hard to program without ruining the game experience. And with multiplayer it would be even harder.

And it would make more sense to provide that for this game, as opposed to other LCGs, being that it's ideal for solo play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60831-lotr-ios-app/?do=findComment&comment=597791","commentId":597791,"userName":"BiJay","timestamp":1329973828,"content":"dh098017 said:\n\n 1.

I think FFG wouldn't want to release an incomplete game, at least I hope so. Releasing a game on an idevice (or other technical devices) where you have to enforce the rules by yourself isn't really a game anymore. It would easily lead to less customers. And why would FFG want to program something for only a few hardcore gamers?\n\n2. I couldn't play it myself cause I only own an iPod 1st Gen atm but what I've seen so far Ascension is still less complex than LotR. It could be possible to manage it somehow.\n\nI don't know about the legal situation but I can imagine releasing OCTGN/Lackey/Vassal wouldn't be possible as they don't own the rights of the card images so Apple would reject it."}]}
