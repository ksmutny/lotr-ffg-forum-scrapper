What things have been found to help against this quest?\n\n \n\nThreat was our problem the whole time (obviously). We have 4 players, and we might be misunderstanding the rules and how you can spend Aragorn's Fellowship resources to remove the attachment from your threat dials, but the quest almost seems broken with 4 players (if we're not misinterpreting the rules). From the first round, it would take 4 full rounds before the last player gets control of Aragorn to spend the Fellowship resource. This means his/her threat will be raised by 8 just from end of turn effects alone. In a 4 player game, the number of encounter cards that would be revealed or have to be otherwise dealt with that would raise threat could easily raise that player's threat by 15-20 just over the course of the 4 rounds, before that player even has a chance to control Aragorn, spend the Fellowship resource, and remove the attachment card. This means if you're starting in the high 20's or low 30's (which is pretty much guaranteed, especially in campaign mode if you previously took the permanent +2 threat increase instead of the burden card), the last player has a very good chance of threating out before being able to even remove the threat dial attachment, much less actually do anything about reducing threat.\n\n \n\nAm I misinterpreting the rules? Can Aragorn's resources pay to remove the attachment even for players who don't control him? Are there strategies or cards that players have found helpful for this quest? I feel like you need to sprint through this quest, but that is obviously hampered by having to discard your hand before you move to stage 2.\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240272-passing-of-the-grey-company/?do=findComment&comment=2600465","commentId":2600465,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1484933150,"content":"Tecnically, the first player token passes before Overcome so it is the guy who starts first who takes most time to de-Overcome.
