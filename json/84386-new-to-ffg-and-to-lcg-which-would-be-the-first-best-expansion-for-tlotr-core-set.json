Fight monsters.. in fact there is a re-skinning of this game in process at BGG turning it into a gladiator game.. This is being rectified in the Saga Expantions. In fact when I speak to new LoTRlcg players and they talk about setting and theme.. what they are really talking about is the Saga expansions. These though are stand along games nearly and IMO is what LoTr was supposed to be in the first place. If your looking for theme, this is where you want to go.

You can make some fun decks form the cards just in 1 copy of core + the hobbits and this will give you a great story driven quest that has progression and continuity to the original books.

Glaurung is probably one of the best deck builders that posts publicly that I know of.. try finding his dwarf deck.. also Outlnads deck is very powerful right now.

You now have a powerful deck that will be able to beat many quest and in the process of building it you also have a ton of quest you can try it out on and a card pool to build more."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84386-new-to-ffg-and-to-lcg-which-would-be-the-first-best-expansion-for-tlotr-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=799766","commentId":799766,"userName":"chancha807","timestamp":1369767697,"content":"booored said:\n\ndoing them \"in order\" is NOT the way to go.\n\nThe card pool was smaller and the game less developed.. so many of the older quest have real problems when trying to compete them.

What is your experience with that expansion ?\n \n\n\n\nI would still buy the hobbit, Kaz is a good expansion and has some fun quest.. but all the encounter decks are only used in darrowdelf packs. This is how LoTR works.. a deluxe expansion and then 6 packs that use its cards.\n\nSo if I was you I would get the Hobbit.. this will give you some awesome quest and some good deck building options. Also it is dwarf themed so the decks will fit perfectly into Kaz and the associated Darowdelf packs witch would probably be your next goal to buy after hobbit 1+2\n\nIf you do that you may consider also buying Return to Mirkwood. The quest is arguably one of the worst designed in the history of the game, especially for solo players, but it comes with some very awesome player cards including Dain Ironfoot… who is a keep card in almost all dwarf decks.. and is really a must buy imo. Some cards are fun, some cards are tricky, and some (like Dain) are the backbone of an entire deck archetype.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84386-new-to-ffg-and-to-lcg-which-would-be-the-first-best-expansion-for-tlotr-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=799782","commentId":799782,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1369771525,"content":"chancha807 said:\n\n \n\nThanks for taking time to reply . Where can I find a listing of expansions in  release order ?\n\n \n\n \n\nJust go to the PRODUCT page of the game itself. All the pack appear in order. They are separated into categories though. Still if you want to know the order of Mirkwood.. just click on the mirkwood set\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=2 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_minisite_sec.asp?eidm=129&esem=2]\n\n\nJust remember that it goes deluxe expansion, then 6 associated packs.. then it repeats. So Core-Mirkwood, Kaz-Darrowdelf, and the current cycle is HoN-Against the Shadow. The PoD (Print on Demand) quests do not really fit in anywhere.. but most people I know class them as 1 per cycle. So the Mirkwood Cycle (Core+Mirkwood+Massing at Osgilith) and the Darrowdelf Cycle is (Kaz+Darowdelf+The Battle of Lake Town). Saga packs are also shown in order, but again they pop up in a separate release scheduled so there is no real way to connect them to the release… Most people I know put Hobbit 1+2 after Darrowdelf Cycle but before the Against the Shadow cycle.. and therefore the New Saga will be after the Shadow Cycle.\n\nHope this helps.. but seriously .. order means nothing. All you need to remember is that each cycle also includes a deluxe expansion.\n\nWell technically the quest get harder as the game goes on, but they are also better designed and power creep means the player cards are also getting way way more powerful.. so it evens out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84386-new-to-ffg-and-to-lcg-which-would-be-the-first-best-expansion-for-tlotr-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=799785","commentId":799785,"userName":"hildargo","timestamp":1369771991,"content":"Check out the blog talesfromthecards.wordpress.com. There is a buyers guide for new players that I think is pretty solid, along with deckbuilding advice and such. Since you have Khazad Dum, I would recommend three quests from that cycle, The Watcher in the Water, Foundations of Stone, and Shadow and Flame. These quest include some great heroes and player cards, and Watcher and Foundations are fun to play. Both Saga Expansions include 4 heroes each (not including the two iterations of Bilbo Baggins) and some great player cards as well, as well as some challenging quests."}]}
