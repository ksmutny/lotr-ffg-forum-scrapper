For instance, looking at a phase like the Planning Phase. \n\n* First Player plays ally and attachment cards\n\n    * Player actions\n\n* Next Player plays ally and attachment cards\n\n    * Player actions\n\nAll of those are green...  \n\nI assume (maybe) that action windows in Green can only be played by the active player?  Unless the action window is \"Player Actions\", in which case any player may play an action?\n\nSince this is a solo game / co-op, I don't have an opposing player to challenge any incorrect timing assumptions, so, I would really like to make sure I understand the intent of the rules fully so I am not \"gaming the system\"\n\nAnyhow, thanks for any help on this (and sorry if this is a dumb question, and/or I am being obtuse... )! \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52244-action-window-confusion-or-its-all-a-matter-of-timing/?do=findComment&comment=520814","commentId":520814,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1314466619,"content":" I think it may just be a clarification of the fact that after the first player is done playing allies and attachments, people can do a bunch of stuff before moving on to the second player.  However, that's also sort of encapsulated in the fact that everything is colored green.  Honestly, I think the timing chart in the back needs a bit of work.  I don't think there is any time during the planning phase where actions are not allowed to be played."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52244-action-window-confusion-or-its-all-a-matter-of-timing/?do=findComment&comment=521491","commentId":521491,"userName":"kirkbauer","timestamp":1314615727,"content":" I was also confused, that is why I created the following document which I think explains the turn sequence and action windows much more clearly:\n\njavascript:void(0);/*1314633707032*/ [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf]\n\n(http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf])\n\nHope that helps!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52244-action-window-confusion-or-its-all-a-matter-of-timing/?do=findComment&comment=521506","commentId":521506,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1314617692,"content":" Looks nice!  I was thinking that actions should be allowed at the beginning of the travel and engagement steps, but then I realized that it probably doesn't make an appreciable difference."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52244-action-window-confusion-or-its-all-a-matter-of-timing/?do=findComment&comment=521733","commentId":521733,"userName":"Squeinstein","timestamp":1314645758,"content":" Thanks!  I am no longer confused.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  \n\n@kirkbauer - I really like the sheet you created, I forwarded the link to a friend of mine who also plays the game.  Very helpful!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52244-action-window-confusion-or-its-all-a-matter-of-timing/?do=findComment&comment=521811","commentId":521811,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1314662897,"content":"kirkbauer said:\n\n \n\n(http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf])\n\nHope that helps!\n\n\n\nIt does.
