Ranged characters can attack enemies engaged with other players so you can attack those if you use Quick Strike on a Ranged character (Possible in your example because you have Legolas). Dunhere can attack enemies in the Staging Area so if you are playing a multisphere Spirit/Tactic deck you could use Quick Strike on Dunhere to attack enemies in the staging area (Not possible in your example because Quick Strike requires you to attack with a hero you control). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47228-a-card-question/?do=findComment&comment=473226","commentId":473226,"userName":"Soulbearer73","timestamp":1306157900,"content":"Ok thanks for answering that question.  That's how we played it, but no one had the Spirit deck and so Dunhere was not  in play for that round.  That is a nice combination though Quick Strike/Dunhere.\n\nThanks."}]}
