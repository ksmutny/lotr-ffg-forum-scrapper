Pretty neat quest, with some innovative encounter cards. As nasty as Durin's Bane is, it can power up even more as its weapons come off the encounter deck. There are some rules issues that need to be resolved, but it's a fun scenario if you don't mind getting slaughtered every once in a while. Pretty hard to beat without a heavy dose of Tactics, though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68785-shadow-and-flame-is-now-available/?do=findComment&comment=670808","commentId":670808,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1344462572,"content":"My shop in Bangkok say SAF wiil be here in 6 days.
