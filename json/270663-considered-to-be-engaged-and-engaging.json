I'm revisiting Ruins of Belegost (I obviously hate my heroes), and have hit the following situation in a \"2-player\" (2 deck) game:\n\nLurker of the Depths (\"...cannot be engaged...while in the staging area, it is considered to be engaged with each player\")  attackes first player in combat phase. It gets a shadow effect from Orc of Ered Luin (\"After this attack, attacking enemy engages the next player, then makes an immediate attack\").\n\nIf Lurker cannot be engaged, can it engage?  Do I leave Lurker in the staging area, but give it an extra attack against player 2? Do I move Lurker from staging to player 2's area? Do I ignore the shadow, as engagement is normally mutual (so I'd assume engagement bars are too)? \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270663-considered-to-be-engaged-and-engaging/?do=findComment&comment=3231777","commentId":3231777,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1519836203,"content":"1) While it is in the staging area it is considered engaged, so it cannot engage with anyone.\n2) Yes.\n3) No.\n4) Most Shadow cards' effects only last until the resolution of the attack so you'd ignore the effects of prior ones (unless a prior Shadow card had an effect with a longer duration than \"this attack\")\n\nEdited February 28, 2018 by Kakita Shiro"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270663-considered-to-be-engaged-and-engaging/?do=findComment&comment=3231837","commentId":3231837,"userName":"Boromore","timestamp":1519838058,"content":"Hmm.

I suspect the answer to your particular scenario is \"make an attack regardless of engagement\" but now I want to hear from someone else about it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270663-considered-to-be-engaged-and-engaging/?do=findComment&comment=3231870","commentId":3231870,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1519839424,"content":"I'd say Lurker in the Depts [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Lurker-of-the-Depths-TRoB] doesn't get to do an extra attack.\n\n \n\nThe preceding effect (on the shadow clause of Orc of Ered Luin [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Orc-of-Ered-Luin-TRoB]) is engaging the nex player. That cannot happen due to being already engaged with all players due to the Lurker text.\n\nSo if the preceding effect doesn't happen (engaging next player) the word \"then\" cannot be taken into account due to rule 1.15.\n\n \n\nI also belive the example of ruling 1.46 also sheads some light in this case despite not being directly applied to the case.\n\n \n\nCJMatos\n\n \n\nMy opinion is based on these 2 FAQ entries: \n\n(1.15) The word “then” If a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve.\n\n \n\n(1.46) “Next” player If there is only one player in the game, there is no next player. Card effects that target the “next” player will not trigger if there is only one player in the game.\n\nFor example: The shadow effect of Pathless Country (TBR 72) reads: “Shadow: After this attack, the attacking enemy engages the next player then makes an immediate attack.” If there is only one player in the game, there is no next player to engage. The word “then” indicates that the immediate attack is conditional on the attacking enemy engaging the next player, so the enemy will not make an immediate attack"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270663-considered-to-be-engaged-and-engaging/?do=findComment&comment=3231881","commentId":3231881,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1519839736,"content":"To add to my previous reply, look at:\n\n(1.50) “Considered to be engaged” vs actual engagement\n\nAn enemy that does not leave the staging area but is considered to be engaged with a player does not actually engage that player, nor does that player engage it. In order for a player to engage an enemy, the enemy card must physically enter his play area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/270663-considered-to-be-engaged-and-engaging/?do=findComment&comment=3232208","commentId":3232208,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1519852792,"content":"I think it makes more sense for the Lurker to not make an additional attack.
