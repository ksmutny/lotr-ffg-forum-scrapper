That way Toughness 1 enemies could be hurt by Gondorian Spearmen etc., and it avoids making the ability too limited in scenarios with Toughness enemies. But I like the idea. Maybe it would make Thalin a little OTT if he could do this to every enemy revealed though...maybe just once per phase?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189014-elrond-style-hero-ability-for-direct-damage/?do=findComment&comment=1808388","commentId":1808388,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1442776975,"content":"At the moment, I feel like direct damage deck is really too situational, even in a support deck. I would love to see something to get it back into the light. I especially like the Ithilien ranger ideas but the Lore direct damage is much, much weaker than Tactics right now (which makes sense). It can still be a nice bonus in a deck to have some direct damage: Beregond doesn't mind the Spear of the Citadel, Tactics Boromir the Mighty Prowess, and the core Gandalf still finds the 4-damage choice useful. But, I am all for more because it is so much fun to try and deal with enemies in a non-traditional way.\n\nEdited September 20, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189014-elrond-style-hero-ability-for-direct-damage/?do=findComment&comment=1808391","commentId":1808391,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1442777124,"content":"I've thought about this possibility too. As monkeyrama says, it sure would be an immense boost for Thalin - but maybe we need a stronger incentive for questing with just 1 WP these days.
