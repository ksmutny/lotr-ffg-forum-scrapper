The CEO of the company announced at Gen Con that this game was the company's unsung hero and was doing very well. I think this is reflected in the number of new releases we're seeing: New deluxe expansion with a full AP cycle, new saga expansions based on the novels, and new print on demand nightmare decks, and POD gen con adventures. Furthermore, the production values keep going up with highly improved art and product inserts. The general feeling around this game is that it is receiving a lot of attention and TLC from FFG and it has a good future ahead of it. I think it's a great time to get into the game.\n\n \n\nIf you're struggling to find adventure packs, keep checking the FFG online store [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/showproducts.cfm?FullCat=248]. They sell for set prices (no markup) and are available if there is any stock to be had (ie- not currently out of print). FFG has consistently said that this game will be \"evergreen\" and reprints will be of sold out products. I certainly would not pay the inflated prices some stores are asking, just wait a few months until the reprints are available."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=949291","commentId":949291,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1389217987,"content":"I ran into this exact same problem when I first begun collecting the game last Summer.  The Shadows of Mirkwood Cycle was impossible to find anywhere.  I distinctly remember really wanted the Tactics Boromir hero from the Dead Marshes pack and the only one I could find was $45 on eBay.  Just ridiculous.  \n\n \n\nI soon realized that Fantasy Flight Games does do continual reprints of (most) of their board and card games, though.  So, hang in there; if you're anything like me, you'll want to collect the game and enjoy it a.s.a.p. and waiting for the reprints can be hard, but once they do reprint them, check out www.CoolStuffInc.com [http://www.coolstuffinc.com] or www.MiniatureMarket.com [http://www.miniaturemarket.com].  I have found that those two gaming stores have the best prices on the internet for the Lord of the Rings LCG expansions.\n\n \n\nGood Luck!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96507-availability/?do=findComment&comment=949644","commentId":949644,"userName":"soldat7","timestamp":1389250239,"content":"> > Interesting.
