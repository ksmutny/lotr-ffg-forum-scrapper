So for example, Quick Strike just creates another opportunity for your hero to attack. During that attack, he's just following the normal rules, so he can attack an immune-to-player-card-effects enemy. And weapons modify the attack value of the hero they're on -- but when the hero is attacking an immune enemy, it's just his attack strength (a normal framework effect) that is counted. The fact that that attack strength was modified by a card earlier doesn't matter: the immune enemy takes the full damage of his strength boosted by the weapon effect. (I believe that's the case for weapons and other stat-boosting attachments; someone please correct me if there's been a contrary ruling.)\n\n \n\nHowever, \"all that player's heroes do not exhaust to attack or defend\" is not a framework effect. Nothing in the regular rules gives an exception to the \"you must exhaust to defend or attack\" rule. So since that's a player card effect, it cannot affect Beorn. The only player card effects that can affect Beorn are the ones printed on his own card: Beorn does not exhaust to defend, and so on. (Interestingly, the \"cannot be affected by player card effects\" rule does not make any exception for \"except for the effects printed on this very card\", but I don't think anyone is playing this incorrectly. Beorn does get the effects printed on his own card, he just can't be affected by any other player cards.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228640-hour-of-wrath-and-beorn-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2387639","commentId":2387639,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1472306796,"content":"I remembver a quest with an encounter card effect that blanks the text of all players characters in play, and I had Beorn. beleive me that after this turn, he had a few attachment on him!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228640-hour-of-wrath-and-beorn-hero/?do=findComment&comment=2388506","commentId":2388506,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1472384753,"content":"> I remembver a quest with an encounter card effect that blanks the text of all players characters in play, and I had Beorn. beleive me that after this turn, he had a few attachment on him!\n\n \n\nOnce that encounter card effect goes away, though, Beorn's \"cannot have attachments\" comes back.
