Your willpower will be 0 and you will raise your threat by the amount in the staging area.\n\nFAQ 1.3 page 6:\n\n \n\nQ: If the players do not commit any characters to a quest, does the staging area still count its threat against them?\nA: Yes, the threat in the staging area still counts against the players, who have a combined committed willpower of 0.\n\n \n\n2- The defense part of the combat phase is only to receive attacks. So you will compare the chosen enemy attack to the chosen defender (hero or ally) deefense and hit points to see if the defender survives.\n\nYou only get to attack on the next part of the phase, where you declare your attackers and against whom they are going to attack.\n\nNOTE: You can only attack an enemy once per round but you can attack him with multiple characters. And you can attack multiple enemies with the same character, provided he is able to do all the attacks (ex: Boromir or with unexpected courage).\n\n \n\n3- Snowbourn Scout's ability let's you choose a location, either it be the active or be in the staging area. Usually iif it is limited to one of them the card text says, ex: Northern Tracker (only staging) or Lorien Guide (only active)\n\n \n\n4- It puts him for free but you loose an hero on the process… And that could be decisive since only heroes collect resources…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78019-detailed-list-of-new-player-questions/?do=findComment&comment=752336","commentId":752336,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1358960519,"content":"Hi Cigar and welcome to the game,\n\n \n\n\nHere are some more things you might find helpful:\n \nYou can download the official FAQ, which contains card errata and further rule explanation, here: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LOTR_FAQ_1.3.pdf [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LOTR_FAQ_1.3.pdf]\n \nThere is also an unofficial FAQ that compiles some additional rules explanations on a card-by-card basis, and can be helpful when you're starting out.
