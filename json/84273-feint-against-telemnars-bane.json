So you play event and force effect triger until you relosve the effect of the event. But after he cannot attack you in this combat phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84273-feint-against-telemnars-bane/?do=findComment&comment=799077","commentId":799077,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1369525065,"content":"I'd play it as you did, Devastazione.  Events are immediate.   Feint is an action, not a response.  The trigger for Telemnar's \"Forced\" effect is the playing of an event.  If Feint has been played, then its immediate effect is that Telemnar cannot attack.   Since the word \"cannot\" is absolute and can't be overridden (as per the FAQ), the Forced effect can't happen."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84273-feint-against-telemnars-bane/?do=findComment&comment=799121","commentId":799121,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1369544771,"content":"Yeah that's pretty much all the rules say about this kind of effect…that's why I played it like that…p.s. Glaurung an effect that triggers after something means that effect has to trigger before resolving the other (pretty much like the beast master that has to attack to gain a second shadow card)…"}]}
