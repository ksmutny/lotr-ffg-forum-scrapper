I doubt that if each next attack dealt shadow card, he can attack me four or more times, this is crazy!!!. So my question is, in the case of smaug, Is shadow card dealt for each of the \"immediately attack\"?\n\n \n\nI sorry, if my language is difficult to understand.\n\n \n\nThank \n\nEdited August 16, 2013 by Starfall1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88620-deal-another-shadow-card/?do=findComment&comment=841976","commentId":841976,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1376673478,"content":"Yes, he does get another shadow card.  He is a dragon, so he IS pretty crazy.  He will eat your entire party in one turn if luck is not with you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88620-deal-another-shadow-card/?do=findComment&comment=842700","commentId":842700,"userName":"Starfall1","timestamp":1376748008,"content":"Yaaa, that bad news for me.
