I agree that making the player decks so much more powerful and, in response, making the quests more difficult. But I don't think the old quests will always be too easy due to this. I'd like to see how well an Outlanders deck would do in Escape from Dol Guldor when Hirluin is the prisoner, especially when you doing a secrecy deck with him. Or how about him getting Sacked! in Conflict at the Carrock? The Outlanders decks have a couple weaknesses:\n\n1. Central Hero: Hirluin. If something bad happens to him early in a game, things can go downhill pretty fast\n\n2. Pretty weak without the allies in play. If you draw poorly and don't get your allies quickly enough, you're stuck with one of the weakest heroes in the game without a helpful ability. If you don't have any of the Lore allies out, a simple Necromancer's Reach can wipe out a large number of allies.\n\n3. Every time you lose an ally, you lose 1 stat from all of your Outlands characters. A simple chump block can mean losing much more than just an ally card.\n\nObviously, once you start piling the allies on, those weaknesses dissipate quite quickly, but that doesn't mean the deck isn't susceptible. From what I've been reading, the Outlanders deck isn't flawless and still fails quests some times. I think that once people have played the Outlanders decks enough, they'll soon be tired of \"easy mode\" and try something new and different. I feel that the other new cards coming in this cycle will offer enough possible new deck options that people won't be sticking with Outlands too long.\n\nAt the very least, I think that the fact that they're releasing Nightmare packs will definitely make the older quests more replayable as the card pool gets stronger."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83796-thoughts-on-the-stewards-fear/?do=findComment&comment=795159","commentId":795159,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1368477354,"content":"I've played a bunch of games with Outlands decks.  I'd be as bold to say that they may be better than Dain Dwarf decks.  I've beat the most difficult quests with them, Including  Dol Gulder.  In fact the time I won was when Hurluin was captured.  I just crushed the Battle of Laketown in 5 round with a score of 69 , and was also able to get all the treasures from the Lonely Mountain scenario.   How about Shadow and Flame, Score 57.  HoN Quests, yes them too.  I beat all the Hobbit scenarions with a Secrecy deck of Glorfindel Spirit and Hurluin and never modifed the deck throughout the whole thing.  I've even beat JDtA, CatC and the 7th Level with Hurluin as my only hero, and on the seventh level I got my best score ever of 57.\n\nI'm not bragging here, yes I have beaten these quests before, but never with such ease,   Before I struggled with some of the difficult quests, and some like Laketown were never easy victories.  Sure, I've lost with Oulands deck too, and horrobly so sometimes, there not Invincible, but do they make the game, as it stands now, easier.  HELL YES!

After a few day consideration, I made the following:\n\nBoromir, Hirluin the Fair, Elrond for a quite thematic Gondor and Outlands deck. The Gondor part is of course little developed but they helped bringing many allies in. The deck had 34 (out of 50) ally cards, Steward, Vilya, Tale, Sneak, Stand and Fight and a piece of Grim Resolve (just for fun). I really liked this line-up despite starting at 32 threat. It wouldn't do well solo, probably, but coop - with the other being a defending deck - it was truly great.\n\nThe companion deck was Beregond, Beravor, Glorfindel. This deck was of course to make the beginning lighter on the Outlands, Beregond was defending throughout the game, slowly becoming more and more invicible. I played Osgiliath. In the end, round 7, he had Gondorian Shield, Spear of the Citadel, Unexpected Courage, Song of Wisdom and A Burning Brand; this is probably nothing new for some but it was the first time I upgraded him so well, and it was fun.\n\nAltogether, I like playing Outlands better than playing Dwarves, but I didn't like playing Dwarves as much. This is new, of course, but it does seem more interesting to me. I like the choices of which boosters to bring in first. It shall really change from quest to quest. Usually the Herdsman is the key but sometimes not needed at all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83796-thoughts-on-the-stewards-fear/?do=findComment&comment=795308","commentId":795308,"userName":"jrd","timestamp":1368514784,"content":"I'm not keen on the way the game has gone since the Hobbit quests and Numenor.

I don't personally see a problem with a new strong deck type emerging, as this is not a player vs player game - its not like magic, where generally a couple of strong deck types rule a format.\n\n \n\nI saw this as FFG trying to create a new \"jumping on\" point for new players - Core, Heirs and Stewards Fear now let you build a pretty strong deck without going back and getting mirkwood/dwarrodelf and the duluxe/saga expansions. This lets new players get into the game with a decent deck without too much initial outlay.\n\n \n\nAt the moment I quite like the outlanders deck, but i also see it as something I'm going to get bored with quickly and build something else.\n\n \n\nAs for the quest - nicely designed, good replayability. I've played it a half dozen times so far with several different decks, and only scored one win so far.  But it doesn't feel too hard for a solo player, like some of the quests do, it seems just the right level of challenging."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83796-thoughts-on-the-stewards-fear/?do=findComment&comment=798050","commentId":798050,"userName":"Style75","timestamp":1369253178,"content":"CaffeineAddict said:\n\n \n\nI saw this as FFG trying to create a new \"jumping on\" point for new players - Core, Heirs and Stewards Fear now let you build a pretty strong deck without going back and getting mirkwood/dwarrodelf and the duluxe/saga expansions.

A lot of new players were turned off by the fact that they can't easily pick up the core set and HofN and be effective. Now with this first AP a new player gets a highly effective deck in just one box and should be able to play through the rest of the AP cycle without having to buy AP's that are two years old (and in many cases out of print!)\n\n \n\nI think it's a smart move from FFG to address one of the big problems people have with this game. I suspect that in future AP's we won't see the kind of mono-theme like we saw from Steward's Fear. They've done that and can now return to fleshing out gondor and monosphere decks.\n\n \n\nWith regards to the quest itself, I'm really enjoying it. I like that it's highly replayable and the synthesis of mechanics, story and flavor is excellent. People are comparing this Emyn Muil but it's sooooo much better than that random wander through the mountains. I really love the direction that FFG is taking this game in terms of building a story, almost like a card based RPG. Keep up the good work Caleb and FFG!"}]}
