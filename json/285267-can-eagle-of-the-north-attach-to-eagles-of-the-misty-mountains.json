It’s an encounter card so it gets shuffled into the encounter deck and has the Encounter keyword. Rules for that keyword state:\n\n• If a player card with the encounter keyword leaves play, it is removed from the game. Do not place it in a player’s discard pile or in the encounter deck discard pile.\n\nWhen this eagle leaves play, can you attach it to Eagles of the Misty Mountains per that card’s effect, or does it get removed from play before you can trigge the Reponse?\n\nhttp://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Eagles-of-the-Misty-Mountains-RtM [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Eagles-of-the-Misty-Mountains-RtM]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/285267-can-eagle-of-the-north-attach-to-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3517350","commentId":3517350,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1540758002,"content":"EoMM: \"Response: After another Eagle character leaves play, you may attach that card facedown to Eagles of the Misty Mountains.\"\n\nRR  Removed from Game [emphasis added]:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> A card that has been removed from the game is set aside and has no further interaction with the game in any manner for the duration of its removal.
