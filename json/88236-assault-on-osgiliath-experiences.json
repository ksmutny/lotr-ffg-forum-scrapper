The quest does seem to increase in difficulty with the number of players as there is a much greater likelihood revealing more osgliliath locations during staging if you are with 2 or 3 people thus prolonging the game. \n\n \n\nThis quest is uncommon in that the longer the game goes the tougher it becomes where as most scenarios if you can make it thru the first few turns and set up; you'll generally be just fine.  With assault on osgiliath, you need to be lucky enough to win within the first 2-3 turns or you're going to be in for a long battle.\n\n \n\nFor my 5 solo attempts i used a different deck each time.  Mono-lore, Lore/Tactics, Lore/Spirit, Mono-leadership/outlands and Mono-tactics. (each lore variation used Faramir and the various ranger cards).  My first attempt with mono-lore lasted forever as i kept staging into osgiliath locations, there was a few times i thought i was just about finished, but eventually won.  I conveniently pulled out all 3 ranger spikes quite early which was a nice boost for faramir.  Lore/tactics and outlands lost quickly as i couldnt get enough will power fast enough and quickly became bogged down with enemies and locations before i could get things set up.  On my Lore/spirit and Mono-tactics i was able to achieve quick victories as i lucked out by only revealing 1 additional osgiliath location after the initial set up.\n\n \n\nI played 3 2-player matches with my friend who was using a glorfindel-elrohir-elladan deck.  I used the outlands, mono-tactics, and spirit/lore.  The outlands attempt went relatively smoothly and we recorded a respectable score.  The Spirit/lore attempt took forever as it seemed the locations would never stop flowing.  On top of that there was an almost endless amount of archery damage being dealt.  At one point we had 3 southran mercenaries and an orc arblaster in the staging area.  Combine those with the pinned down treachery and we had all our characters 1 hp away from death.  Eventually won but it took forever. I used mono-tactics for our final 2 player attempt.  It did not end well.  on like turn 2 we staged into an uruk lieutenant who pulled out the orc vanguard and southran support which pretty much overwhelmed and killed us\n\n \n\nthat was way too much typing but id love to hear you're experiences too as it seems like this is a quest that will mostly turn out differently for each player"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88236-assault-on-osgiliath-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=836595","commentId":836595,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1376216246,"content":"Hoping the UK release is fairly swift.

Whe you play it solo it can be over after 2-3 turns, so I'd suggest to change the rules so that you have to explore at least X Osgiliath locations, with X being a number of your liking.\n\n \n\nI also played it two-handed, and that is a lotm of fun. As Pharmboys said, this quest keeps the tension high and doesn't get boring after a few turns. And it can take forever, most of these games took around 13-15 turns. Almost all my losses were due to reaching the threat limit, so threat managment is vital. It's an excellent designed quest for multiplayer, but not as well thought out for solo mode.\n\nEdited August 11, 2013 by leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88236-assault-on-osgiliath-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=836862","commentId":836862,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1376245453,"content":"After my first two games (second turn wins by choosing The King's Library) I randomly selected the opening location leaving the library out.

And even so, I'm still not sure too would need to add the 10 since you never start the next round. Might need an official ruling from FFG. I don't really think its a huge concern. Just to boost your own scores? Who cares\n\n \n\nFor this scenario the winning condition is at the end of the round. The way i play itis that this happens after the player actions in the refresh phase and these actions happen after the threat increase and the 10 points for round. I might be wrong or missing something but perhaps an official ruling would be better."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88236-assault-on-osgiliath-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=839167","commentId":839167,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1376435503,"content":"Overall, I like this quest so far (only based on 2 play experiences so far, mind you!). It did strike me as a bit odd that there are no minimum requirements as far as how many Osgiliath locations you have to control for victory. I suppose this adds to the unpredictable nature of the quest, but it does facilitate Tactics Boromir/Ancient Harbor madness, as well as some other weirdness. I do have to say that each quest of this cycle has introduced new mechanics and really pushed the boundaries, more so than any previous cycle, and I appreciate that aspect. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88236-assault-on-osgiliath-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=839609","commentId":839609,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1376482709,"content":"My experiences with this Quest playing solo have been far easier than I anticipated at first.

If using mono tactics he's nice to pull down any enemy that starts in the staging area like Forest spider or Harbor Thug.

It was was one of those very satisfying moments when the Knight pulled and killed an enemy of 1 defence strength and 3 hit points (I actually think the difference between 3 and 4 attack strength is the most important in the game, with so many enemies having 4 as their total of defence and hps)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88236-assault-on-osgiliath-experiences/?do=findComment&comment=850247","commentId":850247,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1377497846,"content":"> So first round 4 harad enemies get added by Treachery.
