Trap.\nAttach to an enemy engaged with a player.\nAttached enemy cannot attack.\n\n(Thanks a lot to cardgamedb.com)\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSo when I played my lore deck I made great use of the forest snare. Awesome card. But what happens to Shadow Cards?\n\nThe rules say to deal the shadow cards \"at the beginning of the combat phase\" (p.18) to each enemy that is engaged. Then the rules go on to \"Resolving Enemy Attacks\".\n\n1. Choose an enemy. The first player chooses which attack (among the enemies to which he is engaged) to resolve first.\n\n2. Declare defender.\n\n3. Resolve shadow effect.\n\n4. Determine combat damage.\n\nOk, so my problem was that I don't know which (if any) of these combat steps an enemy that cannot attack goes through. Is just step 4 skipped? That would mean I still have to declare a defender...but since the enemy cannot attack that doesn't make much sense. But if we skip through all the combat steps, what happens to the shadow card dealt at the beginning of the phase?\n\nThe way I played was, that I dealt shadow cards and revealed them and played the shadow effect anyway. But I don't think that's right. Following the rules probably the enemy just keeps the shadow cards and once / if he gets rid of the trap they all trigger at the third combat step. Is that how we should play this? On top of things I drew Ungloianth's Spawn as a Shadow card for the Snared Enemy (while playing the Passage Through Mirkwood quest). That's basically why I decided to play the shadow effects and discard the shadow cards anyway.\n\nAnybody had a similar problem already?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45590-rule-question-forest-snare-shadow-cards/?do=findComment&comment=457318","commentId":457318,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1303420807,"content":"The monster never attacks, so it doesn't go through any of these steps.  You never select it, you never chose if you want to defend, and, most importantly, the monster does not get a shadow card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45590-rule-question-forest-snare-shadow-cards/?do=findComment&comment=457326","commentId":457326,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1303421434,"content":"I agree this would be the best solution, but the rules aren't very clear on this (cf first two paragraphs on p18).
