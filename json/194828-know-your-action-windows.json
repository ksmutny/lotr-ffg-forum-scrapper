Resolving the attack presumably means, go through all the steps of a normal attack, which include an action window.\n\n(By the way, Quick Strike has similar wording.)\n\nEdited December 2, 2015 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194828-know-your-action-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1916075","commentId":1916075,"userName":"Delaric","timestamp":1449079224,"content":"Hmm I see what you mean.  I guess it's unclear then if the windows are there, or it's clear to everyone else but me that they are there.  If so, that allows for some fun shenanigans with Quick Strike as mentioned by OP."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194828-know-your-action-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1916157","commentId":1916157,"userName":"Buhallin","timestamp":1449081138,"content":"The limitation on Ranged joining Quick Strike doesn't have anything to do with the action windows, it's because the ability specifically allows a single attacker.  It's not \"declare an attack\", it's \"pick a character and declare them as an attacker.\"\n\n \n\nWe know the attack process is largely intact, because you go through the standard process.  I don't see any reason to think that the action windows somehow vanish.  And even if there's a question, precedent has generally pushed towards action windows existing even when they're not explicitly stated (such as with Gollum's riddles).\n\n \n\nI think the OP's trick is fine (if a bit combotastic ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194828-know-your-action-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1916689","commentId":1916689,"userName":"jjohnson111","timestamp":1449100393,"content":"I carry these with me where ever I go to play LotR:\n\nhttp://www.orderofgamers.com/downloads/LordoftheRingsLCG_v2.pdf [http://www.orderofgamers.com/downloads/LordoftheRingsLCG_v2.pdf]\n\n(see pg. 5) \n\nI know it doesn't exactly help with your scenario since it is a nested function of the player card, but, it does detail action windows very clearly when you can do them!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194828-know-your-action-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1917026","commentId":1917026,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1449131062,"content":"An attack ALWAYS has the same action windows, no matter when or why it occurs. So many aspects of the game would fundamentally break if there were not action windows at the appropriate places during attacks. The fact that a player card caused the attack is irrelevant, think of it as kicking off the framework \"resolve a player attack against an enemy\" steps. It just happens to be doing it during the planning phase (or whatever phase, in the case of Quick Strike). An attack is an attack, no matter when it happens. The same is true for enemy attacks, which is one of the few ways that you can initiate player actions during the staging step in the quest phase (when an encounter card causes an enemy to make an immediate attack).\n\nEdited December 3, 2015 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194828-know-your-action-windows/?do=findComment&comment=1917345","commentId":1917345,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1449157784,"content":"If they decided to come out with revised rules for Attack and Defense that broke those events out of the action framework and had their own referential sequence, it wouldn't surprise me."}]}
