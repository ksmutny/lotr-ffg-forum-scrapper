This is a fresh idea to the LotR LCF style of play, but I think there are only two missions, that uses this kind of island setting. I wanted to expand on that.\n\nI also did a first beta testing. So far, I have printed them on my home printer, cut them and sleeved the cards. The cards are somewhat shuffle-able but in the end, there could be more.. Does anyone here know a good way to (professional) print them? (I do live in Germany)\n\nAs I am not a native speaker, maybe someone is willing to spell check my wordings? That would be very nice and also a possibility to play that mission on your own! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nHere is a preview of some cards:\n\nc6rjcwxl.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/c6rjcwxl.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\n5hteds5j.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/5hteds5j.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\nbbj2fvzg.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/bbj2fvzg.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\nAs you might have figured, this leads to a game of \"Memory\" (where you have to find pairs of cards, which are face down on the table) in LotR-style. There are only 6 pairs, but as you are distracted by other things like nasty undead it is quite hard to remember all the places. This is the back side of all double sided locations:\n\n278qrh8b.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/278qrh8b.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\nAn example of a \"pair\" card:\n\nuqidi976.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/uqidi976.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\nAnd some cards from the encounter deck:\n\nq3zg3jjf.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/q3zg3jjf.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\n9iykap77.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/9iykap77.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\n2z9o2hvg.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/2z9o2hvg.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\nOh, and did I mention that the tiles move while playng? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]:) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nxlbr44np.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170625/xlbr44np.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\nImages on the cards build the atmosphere of the game, but I am not a painter. So I took all the images from the www, different sources. I hope no one does mind.\n\nCheers,\n\nFlrrb.\n\n \n\n \n\nEdited June 25, 2017 by Flrbb\nbasically, spelling"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252842-custom-mission-pofessional-printing-beta-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2852896","commentId":2852896,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1498419049,"content":"Hello,\n\nTo get cards with a effect the most clear possible I think that you need to use the grammar of the game. To do it simply think about cards who work similar to the one you want to create and make a copy/paste.\n\nI can't help you for your english since I'm French and have similar trouble"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252842-custom-mission-pofessional-printing-beta-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2852909","commentId":2852909,"userName":"987654321","timestamp":1498419638,"content":"Where's the Undead Leader?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252842-custom-mission-pofessional-printing-beta-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2853402","commentId":2853402,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1498453329,"content":"> 9 hours ago, 987654321 said:\n> \n> Where's the Undead Leader?\n\nHere:\n\n8huphaw8.jpg [http://fs5.directupload.net/images/170626/8huphaw8.jpg] [http://www.directupload.net]\n\nIts stats may sound weak (for the endboss), but because of secundary effects of the locations in the victory display, he has +2/+2/+2.\n\nEdited June 26, 2017 by Flrbb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252842-custom-mission-pofessional-printing-beta-testing/?do=findComment&comment=2853425","commentId":2853425,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1498454553,"content":"Hi, Leoric."}]}
