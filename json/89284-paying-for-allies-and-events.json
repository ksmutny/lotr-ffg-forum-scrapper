I am fairly convinced that you may only summon allies and attachments in the Planning phase, but I didn't want to make him kill one of his heroes.\n\n \n\nAnd what about event cards? Another guy in the game played an event card from his hand to alleviate the damage from a monster attack. We had agreed that event cards can be played from the hand even after the Planning phase is at an end (right?), but I objected that there is no action window between defending and attacking in the combat phase.\n\n \n\nIf you guys could help us sort this out, we'd be very grateful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89284-paying-for-allies-and-events/?do=findComment&comment=850742","commentId":850742,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377547984,"content":"allies and attatchments can only ever be played in the planning phase.\n\n \n\nevents can be played in any green window in the phase sheet at the back of the rules book, and those events with 'response' can be played anytime their response requirement is fullfilled....i.e. usually you couldnt play an event directly after a treachery comes out during the staging step, however test of will allows this\n\nrich\n\nEdited August 26, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89284-paying-for-allies-and-events/?do=findComment&comment=850768","commentId":850768,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1377549902,"content":"There is an action windows between defending and attackig.

From the rulebook (p 18):\n\n> When resolving enemy attacks, the players follow these\n> 4 steps, in order.

Actually you have an action window at the end of each step of enemy (4 steps) and player attacks (3 steps).\n\nNote you cannot attack the same enemy twice each round (except using special card effects).\n\nEdited August 29, 2013 by zeb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89284-paying-for-allies-and-events/?do=findComment&comment=853025","commentId":853025,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1377756988,"content":"Look at these threads for suggestions on readying character strategies:\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/thread/901471/ever-vigilanttiming [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/901471/ever-vigilanttiming]\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/thread/783354/unexpected-courage-attachment [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/783354/unexpected-courage-attachment]\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/thread/663131/question-about-unexpected-courage [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/663131/question-about-unexpected-courage]\n\nhttp://boardgamegeek.com/thread/754441/beravor-unexpected-courage [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/754441/beravor-unexpected-courage]\n\n \n\nSo you can use such cards to ready characters at the end of uninterruptible steps and have multiple defendings, multiple draws, etc. as long as you respect explicit limitations (such as attacking the same target once per round the normal way).
