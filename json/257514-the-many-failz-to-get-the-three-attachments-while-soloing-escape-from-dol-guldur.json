However, I noticed I would have much better success if I had the three attachment cards, Steward of Gondor, Celebrian Stone, and Unexpected Courage in my starting hand. However, I realized that getting these three cards in my starting hand were as rare as pigs flying. Therefore, for whatever reason, I decided to make a ridiculous two minute clip of the many failed attempts trying to get these cards in my starting hand synced to the famous CanCan song.
