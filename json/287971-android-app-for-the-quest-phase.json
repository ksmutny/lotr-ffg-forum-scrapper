Right now 4 willpower rows are shown but often only 1 or 2 of them will be used.\n\n-) A button reset the willpower but not the threat could be nice.\n\n-) It would be nice to integrate this with a threat tracker. some people use a different app for this and others will have to qswitch between this app and the physical threat dial.\n\nOnce agian, excellent initiative!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287971-android-app-for-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=3570059","commentId":3570059,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1545152113,"content":"Instead of only +/- 1 and 5 as options for the increases/decreases of Willpower and Threat you could think to add also +/-2 since 1, 2 and 5 can be used to easily add up to any useful number."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287971-android-app-for-the-quest-phase/?do=findComment&comment=3570109","commentId":3570109,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1545155503,"content":"Balanced ternary?\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balanced_ternary]\n\nAnyone?
