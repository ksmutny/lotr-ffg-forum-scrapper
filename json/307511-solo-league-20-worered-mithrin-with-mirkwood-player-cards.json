This month we'll be playing three quests from the Ered Mithrin cycle. The quests are:\n\n1) Roam Across Rhovanion (AP #2)\n2) Fire in the Night (AP #3)\n3) Fate of Wilderland (AP #6)\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.\n\n2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests. This means that you must have at least one of Haldan, Thranduil, and Radagast.\n\n3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:\n\nFor each token you have, you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource. Â This can be done *anytime* during setup.\n\nThe original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:\n\nRule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.\nRule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.\n\nSo for example, if I start with six tokens against Roam Across Rhovanion and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)\n\nRemember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing The Fate of Wilderland it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Fire in the Night.\n\n4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker). You are required to reveal which Heroes you used, and how many cards in your deck came from outside WoR/Ered Mithrin, Mirkwood and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.\n\n5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered in this league. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:\n---\n1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from WoR/EM, Mirkwood or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.\n\n2nd) The number of heroes specifically from WoR/EM and Mirkwood. More is better.\n\n3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: Haldan, Thranduil, and Radagast. More is better.\n\n4th) The number of cards in the deck outside WoR/EM and Mirkwood. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n5th) The number of cards outside Roam Across Rhovanion, Fire in the Night, and Fate of Wilderland. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n6th) Performance in March's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish March's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.\n---\n\n6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for June's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in April's league. May's cycle will be chosen by the winner of March's league.\n\n7) Weekly deadlines will at 11:59pm Eastern on the 14th, 21st, and 28th. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring and cannot be extended -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.\n\nRoam Across Rhovanion: April 14th\nFire in the Night: April 21st\nThe Fate of Wilderland: April 28th\n\n8 ) I've created a google spreadsheet for results here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ThO_2LgNaF1zROfid28UajAeHLrJPHQXcBByBB3566k/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ThO_2LgNaF1zROfid28UajAeHLrJPHQXcBByBB3566k/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nTo join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.\n\nIf you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results, but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself.\n\nEdited April 15 by dalestephenson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307511-solo-league-20-worered-mithrin-with-mirkwood-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3924983","commentId":3924983,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1586275798,"content":"Point of clarity, would a loot deck count towards the tie break rules or not?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307511-solo-league-20-worered-mithrin-with-mirkwood-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3925112","commentId":3925112,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1586290982,"content":"I'm going to rule that a loot deck is *not* considered part of the player deck and has no impact at all on tiebreakers.Â  A contract will also not be considered part of the deck either.Â  Further, I'm going to rule that *if* you do a MotK hero and have 50+ other cards in the deck, the MotK hero does not count as part of the deck for tiebreaker purposes.Â  However, it *will* count as a hero for tiebreak purposes.Â  If you can't use your designated MotK hero due to Caleb's stupid ruling, you may restart the quest at absolutely no penalty.Â  If you use the Master Ring, the Ring does not count as part of the deck (as long as there are 50+ other cards in the deck), but the selected Master card will be counted as part of the deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307511-solo-league-20-worered-mithrin-with-mirkwood-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3925246","commentId":3925246,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1586308037,"content":"Two more points of clarification, if you don't mind...\n\n1) are spoiled, unreleased proxies allowed?

There was not much to report when it comes to scenarios 1 and 3 -- blew through them both without a whole lot of trouble.Â \n\nBut Fire in the Night... boy was that tough.\n\nI started with 0, 1, and then 2 tokens, each time for resources because I just couldn't get enough eagles in to balance everything. The constantly bad side quest flips were not helping. It was frustrating on 3Â tokens because I thought I finally had it under control, and then a few too many attacks by the dragon beast had me reeling. I really thought my deck had it... it felt so close. I wanted to replay it on 3, but the rules are the rules.\n\nSo I jumped to 5 just to guarantee I could get through it. I took 2 cards and 3 resources. I played my cards, keeping 3 resources to putÂ Descendant of Thorondor into play after questing successfully, courtesy of Hirgon, so that I could, in theory, place some damage on a new enemy. Alas, what should flip but Swarm of Bats... discard all the resource tokens. So, essentially, wiping out my 3/5 Grace of Valar....Â ðŸ™„Â Annoying. But I knew I was close last time so I was hopeful and started playing through.\n\nIt was a slog, but I finally started staying on top of questing and clearing locations and side quests. Gwaihir got the Support of the Eagles, and could usually take the first and second shots of from the dragon without sweating (courtesy to a lot of eagles under Eagles of the Misty Mountains). I started using the Staff to ready eagles instead of lowering costs.\n\nGwaihir, as a whole, is... an interesting hero. He is a great early-mid round hero. Early game, he is a little weaker because eagles are expensive, and you can usually only get one ready out of him. Once you get eagles in and out, he is providing multiple actions each turn. But as the game turns into a marathon, he begins to slow down as you slowly run out of eagles and ways to get them in and out of play. You don't want to turtle for too long with him. He is definitely unique in that aspect of being an absolute powerhouse but only after setup and not for very long. I could tell in the three quests that I was coming to the end of his viability and had the urgency to end the quest as soon as possible because after the last of the eagles are gone... he is not readying again.\n\nÂ "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307511-solo-league-20-worered-mithrin-with-mirkwood-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3927745","commentId":3927745,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1586980050,"content":"I decided to tweak my Radagast Eagles deck that failed against Angmar and try it out again, substituting Grimbeorn for Aragorn.
