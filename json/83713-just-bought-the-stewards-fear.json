Very very difficult!\n\nNow we build up 2 dwarfes decks which is working fantastic in combo. Actually they play like 1 big deck.

In fact, I think the only real comparison is that they are location heavy adventures. This AP has lots of flavor and is very fun thematically. I like the fact that it's very different from the HoN box set adventures. Diversity is the spice of life. Yes, this AP is not bone crushingly hard, but I see that as very good thing. Not every AP should be at the maximum difficulty level.\n\nKudos to the designers for coming up with a fun, flavorful story rich AP that breaks some new ground in game play."}]}
