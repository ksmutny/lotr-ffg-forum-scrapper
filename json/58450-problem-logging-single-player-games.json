I have logged 3 and 4 player games, and everything has worked wonderfully. But, when I log a single player quest, the Quest Log tells me at the end that it has been entered, but then I see nothing when scanning through an overview of my activities. \n\nAny help is appreciated. Sorry again if this is a double post of some topic that I just did not see. \n\n \n\nAlso, what an awesome game! I admit that I had my doubts back when I heard about this co-op LCG being in the works. But, Nate and company really did excellent work on this. Simply amazing!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58450-problem-logging-single-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=575094","commentId":575094,"userName":"Zjb12","timestamp":1325756923,"content":" I noticed my games were not logging after the first of the year also.  Wondered if there was a glitch switching something over from 2011 to 2012.  Not sure what that would be though.  Have not tried logging any games for a couple of days though."}]}
