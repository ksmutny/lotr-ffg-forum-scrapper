It is fun to see the statistics on hero uses for one self and the community. However, multiplayer games could be better supported.\n\nAnyway, FFG, please support Quest Log properly and add the new heroes as soon as they are released. It can't be that much work."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69656-elrond-hero-missing-from-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=680239","commentId":680239,"userName":"Eric W","timestamp":1345710745,"content":"I don't see the new quests either.\n\n \n\nBut I'm another that uses it for every game I play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69656-elrond-hero-missing-from-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=680373","commentId":680373,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1345720086,"content":"I still use it.
