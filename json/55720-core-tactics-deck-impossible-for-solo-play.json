Or am I missing something here?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55720-core-tactics-deck-impossible-for-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=551069","commentId":551069,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1320301290,"content":"I agree with you.

With only 21 Threat left until you're eliminated. The location cards alone set to increase your threat so much you have no option but to commit all your Heroes to the quest, leaving just your allies to defend. It's a shame because I think the core deck would be better if a number of allies had more will to them, otherwise someone like me starting with the Tactics deck on solo could think the game is badly balanced."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55720-core-tactics-deck-impossible-for-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=551182","commentId":551182,"userName":"ppsantos","timestamp":1320315835,"content":"It's doable.

However I have bought the first three adventure packs and now the deck is very strong. Played Conflict at the Carrock this morning and wiped the floor with the trolls, although I guess a quest based on killing things is right up those band of brothers street! My only thought is although it is legal (I believe) to use cards from a later pack in an earlier quest is it morally ok? Should you not be able to beat quests with the cards available at the time..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55720-core-tactics-deck-impossible-for-solo-play/?do=findComment&comment=552583","commentId":552583,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1320578533,"content":" I think the intersection of morality and the LOTR LCG is quite thin.  I think it's ok :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
