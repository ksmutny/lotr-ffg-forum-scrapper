You are replacing a revealed card, thus the replacement is considered revealed. Replace means you are taking another card and putting it in place of it.\n\nSo, you reveal a card, then using Eleanor you decide to replace it. You are still in the process of revealing a card, but the original card was replaced with a new card, thus the new card is still considered to be revealed.\n\nThis is how I've seen it all along, so it makes sense to me.

that might be the intention, but possibly it isn't and the FAQ should be clarified.\n\nBasically, FFG (Nate) has now begun to put specific meaning to the word revealed and made that a critical in determining if a When revealed effect occurs or not, which is fair enough, but in doing so, we need to make sure that FAQs use the very specific wording when neccessary.\n\n \n\nCurrently\n\nRevealed is not the same as attached but enters play covers revealing and attaching, but I'm not sure if that is the intention of how surge, doomed and guarded should be played...\n\n \n\nDid that make any sense!?!?!?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54362-clarifications-on-revealing-with-eleanor-and-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=539445","commentId":539445,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1318184734,"content":"I think Surge, Doomed, and Guarded would still happen even when attached during Dol Guldur setup.

I'm confused by your solution.\n\nThe instructions on the quest card cover attaching the \"guards\" to the objectives. There's no reason to fire off the Guarded mechanic during this particular, unique setup. It's already got that covered. The reason it is worded the way it is is because they want you to shuffle before drawing those three \"guards.\"\n\nThe issue and ruling that this thread is discussing is whether any \"When Revealed\" text would apply considering the nature of this particular, unique setup.\n\nWhile it may not require a PhD to decipher, it IS a particular and unique situation where we now know that something different is going to happen. The \"When Revealed\" isn't going to happen since the reveal is being bypassed by the quest card instructions.\n\nAnd don't call me a weakling. I drink chocolate milk with dinner.
