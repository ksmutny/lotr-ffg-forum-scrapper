If not, can someone be so kind to type it?\n\n \n\nI know it's a pain but I would be extremely thankful.\n\n \n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91716-nightmare-decks-decklist-please/?do=findComment&comment=884088","commentId":884088,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1381227082,"content":"There should  be 20 cards for each quest.
