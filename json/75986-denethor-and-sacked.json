But does that mean you can't use Denethor's ability to look at the top card and move it to the bottom of the encounter deck?? The word 'cancel' is not in the card text for Denethor (unlike Eleanor). So is this legit?\n\nThanks for your advice."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75986-denethor-and-sacked/?do=findComment&comment=737345","commentId":737345,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1356076831,"content":"Denethor's ability can be used to put a Sacked! card at the bottom of the encounter deck because his ability is not a \"cancel\" ability."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75986-denethor-and-sacked/?do=findComment&comment=737366","commentId":737366,"userName":"Migwald","timestamp":1356080152,"content":"Thanks for the confirmation"}]}
