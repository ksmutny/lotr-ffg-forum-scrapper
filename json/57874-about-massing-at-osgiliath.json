I am wondering if I should buy massing at osgiliath soon, because im worried that later on it wont be sold anymore. I know it is print on demand but I am not sure exactly what that means and how long it will actually keep being print on demand. \n\n \n\nthanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57874-about-massing-at-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=570166","commentId":570166,"userName":"Dwnhmcntryboy","timestamp":1324480997,"content":" If you have the disposable income then get it now..if not don't.

Nice story, ridiculously hard. We played four games during a weekend session, everyone was pissed that day. I guess it's not going to hit the table again.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57874-about-massing-at-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=575022","commentId":575022,"userName":"dj2.0","timestamp":1325744182,"content":"Assuming all available cards, are there any good decks for this difficulty 9 horror?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57874-about-massing-at-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=575032","commentId":575032,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1325745642,"content":"If you have the cash it's worth it otherwise save your money and get it later.

When I first beat Massing solo during a deck testing session I was so happy. It was defiantly one of the best game experiences io have had in a long time. You get a great feeling of accomplishment and a real sense of achievement that your deck building and play strategies you have devised works.. This is how the game is meant to be..

But officially not some hand made ideas.\n\n "}]}
