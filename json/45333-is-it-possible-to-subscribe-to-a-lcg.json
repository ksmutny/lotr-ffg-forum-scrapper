I have a standing pre-order on anything Warhammer Invasion with my LGS. That's about the next best thing I suppose. Now that I think about it, I prefer this. Once the packs hit the stores, spoilers go up and then I have to have it now. I don't want to have to wait for FFG to ship it to me. Plus, if nothing else, it gives me a chance to drag the GF to the \"Pokemon Store\" once a month."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45333-is-it-possible-to-subscribe-to-a-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=455205","commentId":455205,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1303118470,"content":"Go to your local store and subscribe there.

For the most part th FLGS is the way to go- supporting the industry and saving yourself all the ordering hassle."}]}
