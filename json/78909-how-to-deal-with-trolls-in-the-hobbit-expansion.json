Using Nori and other threat reduction cards, i was abile to keep myself under the threat of being attacked by all the trolls at once. Use the first phase to build up your allies. If you can manage it right , you should be able to kill the trolls with one attack from an eribor battle master.\n\n \n\nI know elrond, Nori, and dain worked well for me. Elrond gives you access to tactics heroes and elrond's council. I did this combo where I would use \"We are not idle\", lure of moria, and will of the west to generate infinite resources. It kinda breaks the game, so variations on this work well too if you're not looking to basically become invinsible to the encounter deck.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78909-how-to-deal-with-trolls-in-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=760032","commentId":760032,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1360244463,"content":"The above suggestions are good. If you want to go the tricky route, you can also use O Elbereth! Gilthoniel! to send the troll who restricts how many characters can attack to the bottom of the encounter deck. This frees you up to swarm the remaining trolls. If he happens to pop out again later, at least you won't be dealing with all the trolls at once. Alternatively, you can use Elbereth on the troll who prevents attachments, and then you would be able to use Forest Snares."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78909-how-to-deal-with-trolls-in-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=760033","commentId":760033,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1360244576,"content":"Actually, the troll you put on the bottom couldn't pop out again, because that would be the last card of the encounter deck and advance you to the next stage! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78909-how-to-deal-with-trolls-in-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=760042","commentId":760042,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1360246152,"content":"Raven1015 said:\n\nActually, the troll you put on the bottom couldn't pop out again, because that would be the last card of the encounter deck and advance you to the next stage! \n\n\n\nHah!

Woops. Haven't tried for real since then, but I presume it's very hard given the decks. The gimli deck has a bunch of practically worthless cards that offer little interaction. The other deck can make up for it if you have the god hand:\n\nT1: Steward of Gondor into Fili (and obviously Kili) into A Very Good Tale into Galdalf/ That 6cc dwarf can give you a nice start with lots of guys to block the trolls and the trigger on the extra resource.\n\nIf the Gimli deck draws well it might even hold off the trolls for a while. You need to be lucky with the encounters though. If you take on two trolls as well (recommended imo, and you often have little choice) you'll take two 'sacks' and with some bad luck (as you can't assign the sacks) 2 heroes might even immediately die. You can try to use Gandalf v1to deal extra damage. Boosting Gimli is the key though, unless you actually have cards from other sets."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78909-how-to-deal-with-trolls-in-the-hobbit-expansion/?do=findComment&comment=760140","commentId":760140,"userName":"Nizi","timestamp":1360259869,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\n \n\nHas anyone tried to use Dúnedain Signal together with Hands Upon the Bow and Khazad-Khazad on a damaged Gimli to clear the trolls when they're still in the staging area?\n\n \n\n \n\nI thought the trolls couldn't be damaged while in the staging area? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\n(edit: sorry, didn't find the edit button at first :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\n \n\nAs for sending a troll to the bottom of the deck: that's kinda cheap.

I did a wrong translation.\n\n \n\nI just tried out another idea (against Peril in Pelargir) which might also work against the trolls. It's a bit more complicated and requires a special deck building.\n\nThe idea is to have two tactics heros. One for the kills (Legolas or Hama) and one for questing (Gimli, Thalin, Elladan) or defending (Beregond). The third hero has to be from the lore sphere. In the troll scenario Loragorn is the prefect choice, as he will lower your threat level just before you encounter  the trolls. While playing the game your questing/defending tactics hero will built up his ATT by attaching Keepig Count to both tactics heroes. Needless to say that this deck should include three copies of Master of the Forge and Daeron's Runes to get these attachments in time (which is why the third hero has to have the lore icon). Gleowine is also very helpful to make this deck work."}]}
