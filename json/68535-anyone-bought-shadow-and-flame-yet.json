Based on the member search facility on this site there are not that many LOTR LCG players in Denmark. I live in Copenhagen and most of the times we buy the LOTR LCG expansions at either Faraos or Fantask. It seems they each buy four or five copies of each expansion so maybe they share around ten LOTR LCG customers in the Copenhagen area between them. Of course other Danish players buy them online or from other shops.\n\nThis is not a problem for me and my family as we play it as a family game - both solo and up to four players. The cooperative gameplay and scalability from single to multiplayer are the best features about this game's design and it was the major reason that we picked it up on recommendations from Faraos - apart from the always popular LOTR theme of course."}]}
