This leads me to ask this here, since now we see the same wording with Lord of Morthond. And I am doing it here, instead of the official ffg way, in case some of you have already asked it and got the answer.\n\n \n\nTo be plain: when the card reads \"after you play\", what does it actually mean?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86047-rules-enters-play-vs-play-from-hand-vs-play/?do=findComment&comment=810546","commentId":810546,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1373363513,"content":"when you pay for it in the default manner."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86047-rules-enters-play-vs-play-from-hand-vs-play/?do=findComment&comment=810571","commentId":810571,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1373369258,"content":"ps: Of course I understand \"enters play\" basically includes \"after you play from hand\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86047-rules-enters-play-vs-play-from-hand-vs-play/?do=findComment&comment=810572","commentId":810572,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1373369309,"content":"> when you pay for it in the default manner.\n\nBut what is then the difference between play from hand and play?

The FAQ has had complete turn arounds on rules between versions, making a card legal to do one thing in one faq and then it can not in the next faq. We have had card erratad and then errated again as the last errata broke game rules. The \"ask the designers\" email system has returned rulings that are completely incorrect when you read the rules and the faq. The amount of times these have be reversed in a faq is a joke. We have different events using the same keywords .. it is a real mess. get used to it."}]}
