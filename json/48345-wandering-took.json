It is like the Took has a weaker version of Ranged and Sentinel.\n\n2) In solo there are no other players to give the Took too so you can not use his ability. In solo you use Wandering Took as a cheap body to throw before your enemies. Cost 2 for 1/1/1/2 is fairly good even without his ability."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48345-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=484879","commentId":484879,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1308008168,"content":"Blepta said:\n\n \n\n2) How should I play this card in solo game?

Once you get into deckbuilding I see little use for them. Right now it is impossible to reach the 50 card tournament limit without doing dual-spheres, which means you will have a host of other allies to choose from. Even when I had only one core set my Spirit/Tactics deck did not use this card. I took some lower cost tactics allies instead."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48345-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=484887","commentId":484887,"userName":"jesseolivier2","timestamp":1308008960,"content":" wandering took is awesome in a deck when your playing with a friend whose deck is spirt and leadership. They have tonns of ways of lowering their own threat, but it could get to a point where they have it to spare. You can pass on Your Wandering Took, they can get rid of that new threat, then pass him right back.\n\nkinda neat idea but only really works in easy quests i think?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48345-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=485011","commentId":485011,"userName":"Kzer-za","timestamp":1308035222,"content":"Wandering Took's ability is useful not so much for the threat manipulation, but for giving someone an ally in a pinch, like when they need an extra blocker or an extra point of attack. Without the ability, he's still a decent cheap ally."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48345-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=485166","commentId":485166,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1308057827,"content":" Yeah, I question the usefulness of his special ability too, but the stats seem to make him one of the best low-cost allies in the game. An extra Will for  quests or as a back-up attacker is pretty much always useful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48345-wandering-took/?do=findComment&comment=485430","commentId":485430,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1308100241,"content":" I think the Tooks threat manipulation is useful, if you build the decks to utilize it.
