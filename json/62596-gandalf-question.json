So I used Sneak Attack to put Gandalf into play, activating his 4 DMG effect, and after the combat phase ended, due to the Sneak Attack card, Gandalf returned to my hand...\n\nOn the next turn I payed 5 to play Gandalf, and used his 4 DMG again, removing him after the turn ended.\n\nIs that ok? Looks kinda Over to me but I think it is fine right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62596-gandalf-question/?do=findComment&comment=612613","commentId":612613,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1333368992,"content":"looks good to me-\n\n \n\nsneak attack return to hand\n\npay for full - disacard\n\n \n\nrich"}]}
