So it is more clear that the Player is controlling the attachment and can control only 1 at any given time. Remember that there is (as far as i know) no official Statement in the rulebook that you *control* your thread dial like you do with your cards on the board.\n\nIn multiplayer you could ask who has control over FotV if you attach it to another Players thread dial (if it would spell Thread dial instead of Player) which would lead to the possibility of attaching more than 1 to the same dial.
