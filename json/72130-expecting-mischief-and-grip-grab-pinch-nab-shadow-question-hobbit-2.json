Like if you have to deliver 6 points and use up 3 and kill one character when you move to the next and he has 2 shields and 2 health you still use the shields and only deliver one wound. Also you couldn’t give 6 characters one wound each?\n\n\n\n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72130-expecting-mischief-and-grip-grab-pinch-nab-shadow-question-hobbit-2/?do=findComment&comment=705040","commentId":705040,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1349379105,"content":" Regarding 1st question: Since the card is worded in a similar way to Thalin's ability (Deal x damage to … enemy revealed … ) I've been playing that it works the same way. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72130-expecting-mischief-and-grip-grab-pinch-nab-shadow-question-hobbit-2/?do=findComment&comment=705064","commentId":705064,"userName":"raven614","timestamp":1349382929,"content":" Thanks for the reply. Yea that's the way i've been playing it just wanted to confirm with someone. I've been using Denethor and Expecting Mischief and finally won hobbit 2. My other hero's were Gimli and Glorfindel. No spirit so the game has to be played in about 15 turns unless Gandolf comes in to save the day."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72130-expecting-mischief-and-grip-grab-pinch-nab-shadow-question-hobbit-2/?do=findComment&comment=705171","commentId":705171,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1349408262,"content":"regarding 2- when dealing actual damage you never take into account defense, as to the other i dont see why you couldnt give one wound each?\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72130-expecting-mischief-and-grip-grab-pinch-nab-shadow-question-hobbit-2/?do=findComment&comment=705292","commentId":705292,"userName":"raven614","timestamp":1349429024,"content":" Shadow: Defending player deals damage among characters he controls equal to the number of Goblin enemies with him.\n\n \n\nSo yes I see now you deal the damage out disregarding the shields but you can spread it out the way you want. I have to remember to read the text very carefully. Thanks Rich. Sorry about the dumb question but still playing and enjoying the game. I only have the core set Kaza Dum and the hobbit. I was thinking about going right into this new saga expansion with the new city seige. Was wondering if the new mechanics would make the earlier expansion cards not as useful.
