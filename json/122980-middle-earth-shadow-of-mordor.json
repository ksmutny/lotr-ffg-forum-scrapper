Sure, you can make whatever fanfiction you can using names and places of Middle Earth, and the story on its own can be good, but that doesn't mean work as an adaptation is good, since it contradicts the canon. Without knowing much about the game, but based on what had been said about it here, it seems the developers didn't even research enough to know a dead elf as a wraith (FFG has done this, Lost Soul of Lorien) is somethng that does not happen, or at least didn't give a good justification for it.\n\n \n\nAnd that is why I always say, why do fanfiction? If your story is good and you're not going to do enough research so that there's no incompatibility with the source material, why make it then? Why does it have to be in Middle earth at all? Why not create your own universe? But that's another discussion.\n\nEdited September 29, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122980-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/?do=findComment&comment=1281480","commentId":1281480,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1412024183,"content":"I am ok with spin-offs and derivative works bending the lore a bit, because its basically glorified fan-fiction: and fan fiction never really fits in with the established setting.

That nemesis system you're talking about is something presented as complicated in a good way, but is extremely simple in the end. Notable orcs just remember what happened, which is done by simple variable manipulation.

Levelling up and being decent at the game removes some of the fun though as dying is part of what makes it interesting.\n\n \n\nI honestly think that when it came to wargs and trolls, they wanted to go complete movie license but weren't allowed to. While Jackson and his company did collaborate on the art design for the game I think they weren't willing to let them copy the designs for wargs and trolls for the movies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122980-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/?do=findComment&comment=1291590","commentId":1291590,"userName":"Epi Lepi","timestamp":1412713288,"content":"> No, I don't think that DLC's will add something really fresh to the game, just another mob of orcs to slice through.\n\n \n\n \n\nThey announced a DLC where you play as Celebrimbor when he was still alive that sounds like it could be interesting. I hope they change up his combat style slightly, like the differences between Batman, Robin and Catwoman in Arkham City."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122980-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/?do=findComment&comment=1291635","commentId":1291635,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1412714803,"content":"They could design their own wargs and trolls, it's not a big deal. And the Gollum was exact copy from the movie, by the way.\n\nYou can call the system cool, but its nothing special. Technically, it's the only thing that keeps this boat afloat and prevents it from being a complete boredomfest. Dying is not what makes the game interesting, being hard to stay alive does."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122980-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/?do=findComment&comment=1318341","commentId":1318341,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1414800940,"content":"Man, finished the game today and I will not spoil, but I definitly did not like some things they did there.\n\nAt least were sure there will be a sequel! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nAlso indeed did not like the way the let Ratbag leave play...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/122980-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor/?do=findComment&comment=1318482","commentId":1318482,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1414827086,"content":"Yeah.
