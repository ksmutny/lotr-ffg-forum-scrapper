This gives the feeling as if he took part in a great adventure (as in RPG). This is a plus buying AP in chronological order.\n\n \n\nEvery time as released a new AP, the pool of cards players increases, giving a feeling like heroes gained experience, they became stronger and gained new allies. At the same time, each scenario is pushing the storyline forward, even the threat of Sauron grows, it is more noticeable. And also the scenarios become more epic - from simple delivery of the message to Lady Galadriel, to the battle of Osgiliath. From the Mirkwood we wandered up to the very gates of Minas Morgul.\n\n \n\nSo now, looking back I can say that my team has come a long way, surviving many adventures, gained a lot of experience and allies, but even though that is stronger, more experienced, this is not the end of the road, yet much more dangerous adventures ahead of us, and a long way before us. Soon we will move to Isengard.\n\n \n\nSo it is for me plus,  buying expansions chronologically. And that feeling of waiting for the next - what else awaits us on our way. Where to take us this time fate.\n\nEdited February 22, 2014 by 13thcaesar"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99852-plus-buying-supplements-chronological/?do=findComment&comment=993194","commentId":993194,"userName":"Lilikin","timestamp":1393158484,"content":"As a newbie, how do I easily see the chronological order of the packs?

Still Khaz is stand alone, so are the Core quests. Mirkwood and Darrowdelf do have a loose order making a story.. but it is not as strong as recent packs.\n\n \n\nSo while I personally think playing it in order is unimportant, if you are a \"deep story\" kind of guy I would at least play each section in order. Though witch section you start makes zero difference as the stories are self contained and do not spill over.\n\n \n\nBTW, the release order is posted on the product page. The cycles are listed bottom to top, in order and each pack is in order form top to bottom when you click on them,. deluxe packs are also in order and all come out before the associated cycle. PoDs come out in order after each cycle.\n\n \n\nSo in the provided list add a PoD between the end of each cycle and the deluxe. Hobbit 1/2 is after Darrowdelf and Black Riders is after HoN.... again Saga packs are shown in order...\n\n \n\nDelux\n\nCycle\n\nPoD\n\nSaga\n\n \n\nseams to be the pattern.\n\nEdited February 23, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99852-plus-buying-supplements-chronological/?do=findComment&comment=993237","commentId":993237,"userName":"13thcaesar","timestamp":1393164105,"content":"Each deluxe expansion is a prelude to the next cycle. \n\n \n\nCore Set  -> Shadows Of Mirkwood Cycle.\nKhazad-Dum Deluxe Expansion  -> Dwarrowdelf Cycle.\nHeirs Of Numenor Deluxe Expansion  ->  Against The Shadow Cycle.\nThe Voice Of Isengard Deluxe Expansion -> The Ring-maker Cycle.\n \nBesides, each cycle using the Encounter decks, which includes Deluxe Expansion.
