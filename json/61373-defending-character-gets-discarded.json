I was just hoping someone could enlighten me as to how you handle an attack when the defender is discarded due to a shadow card effect. I had it happen once today while playing Redhorn Gate where Snowstorm was dealt as a shadow card, and my defending ally was discarded. Is the attack considered resolved, or does this attack go against other heroes/allies? Also, do I have a chance to defend with these other characters if in fact the attack redirects? Just hoping someone can clarify for me. It's never come up for me until today, but there's a good chance if affected the outcome of my game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61373-defending-character-gets-discarded/?do=findComment&comment=601792","commentId":601792,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1330806172,"content":"if an ally gets discarded when defending- the attack is considered undefended and thus needs to be converted to damage and placed on a hero\n\nalso you're lucky if youve managed with not encountering this till now- its a pain and you feel all the more lucky for hasty stoke and likewise"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61373-defending-character-gets-discarded/?do=findComment&comment=601794","commentId":601794,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1330806473,"content":" Argh. Yeah, that changes today's win to a loss. Lol. Up until now the only time it happen was with Sudden Pitfall, but it killed off my last hero anyways so I never had to deal with what to do with the enemies remaining attack. Jeesh, that's rough.
