Elladan is solid, but his inclusion means that 2 hero slots are taken and so severely limits deck building opportunities. A really powerful, fun Glorfindel would have been great\n\n\n\n2.       Another Tactics Silvan hero: Obviously Legolas is great and arguably the tactics silvan allies work best with Thranduil anyway, but a tactics hero that synergizes with Silvan strategies would have rounded out a really fun archetype\n\n\n\n3.       Noldor attachment that synergizes with heroes spending resources: Noldor has four heroes that spend resources to use their special ability. In my experience two of these get rarely used (Glorfindel, Elladan) on Gildor the effect is solid and Elrohir I consider it to be formidable. I wished such an attachment would exist to give Glorfindel a significant boost.\n\n\n\n4.       Another Dunedain hero apart from Aragorn: I am still a bit in shock about the Spirit Aragorn fiasco. I feel that the Dunedain selection is good in Leadership and Lore, but I feel like they miss a low-threat option in Spirit and Tactics.\n\n\n\n5.       An excellent 2/3--cost leadership Rohan ally: Rohan received a serious boost in the last cycle, but I felt they have emphasized the Spirit/Tactic sphere even more than before. I am fine with them essentially having abandoned lore, but I consider it a bit disheartening that they have some really good leadership heroes, but the arguably best ally in the sphere remains the solid-at-best Snowbourn scout.\n\n\n\nHonorably mentioned: A better silvan/noldor weapon in lore, a better leadership and low-cost Noldor ally\n\n\n\nAll things considered the game have had a great run and none of the main archetypes has holes that makes them unplayable even against the harder quests, I just wished we would have gotten these cards.\n\n\n\nWhat makes your list?\n\n\n\nEdited October 4 by RebelX"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311668-top-5-cards-you-would-have-liked-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=3997450","commentId":3997450,"userName":"TrueLolzor","timestamp":1601811649,"content":"I'd like to see Blue, Red, and Purple versions of Saruman."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311668-top-5-cards-you-would-have-liked-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=3997466","commentId":3997466,"userName":"koriakin97","timestamp":1601814750,"content":"I would change 5 to Aragorn ally, so that when I travel to Prancing Pony I can play him for free from my hand"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311668-top-5-cards-you-would-have-liked-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=3997472","commentId":3997472,"userName":"koriakin97","timestamp":1601815942,"content":"And about Silvan tactics hero- you can kinda supplement it with Haldir, Thranduil Legolas deck. You pack all offensive silvan allies, elves weapons and events like Hands upon the bow. You can easily kill up to 4 enemies each turn before they attack. Works best with questing Celeborn deck"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311668-top-5-cards-you-would-have-liked-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=3997554","commentId":3997554,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1601837015,"content":"What latest comments from Caleb?

Spirit Sam Gamgee hero: This would have completed the set with each of the four hobbits having a spirit and a non-spirit hero. This card should have reflected his role as a gardener.  Maybe something like: Planning Action: Discard a resource from Sam Gamgee to gain: Action: If Sam Gamgee has committed to the  quest this round, play an ally or attachment from your hand. reduce that card's cost by 1. \n\n2. Another Spirit and Leadership Guarded card. More palantiri would have been nice, and I feel that Guarded cards would have been the best way to get them. A Guarded (Enemy) ally who plays into your staging area would have been a fun way to get Dunedain decks to have enemies engaged with them without having to deal with the threat.\n\n3. Another four cost Beorning would have been fun. Maybe one with 8 hitpoints, 0 defense, and Response: After this ally defends an attack, discard it to deal x damage to the attacker where x is this allies remaining hitpoints.\n\n4. More unique Gondor allies: Bergil, Hurin the Tall, Duilin, etc.\n\n5. More support for damaged dwarves like Gloin, Gimli, and Veteran of Nanduhirion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311668-top-5-cards-you-would-have-liked-to-see/?do=findComment&comment=3997848","commentId":3997848,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1601911143,"content":"> 20 hours ago, Gizlivadi said:\n> \n> What latest comments from Caleb?

And with the new contract in the Dreadnaught I have hopes for even the odd player card in new packs. So here is my list:\n\n \n\nLOTR lcg heroes and allies I want to see:\n\n \n\n \n\nHeroes:\n\n \n\n \n\n1. Crown of the Windlord Attachment that lets you exhaust it to return a Eagle ally from the discard pile or in play to your hand. \n\n2. Fembrithel an Ent-Wife! (Or just another Lore or Tactics Ent hero like Leaflock or Skinbark preferably the former as its ally isn't great and maybe an ability like deal it a damage to increase its defense by 3)\n\n \n\n3. A Stone Giant (Gandalf did say there were good Giants, imagine one who starts with Toughness 1)\n\n \n\n4. Lore Legolas (he just seems like he should have one, maybe with the ability to discard a card to ready after declaring an attack or after he participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, ready Legolas. To show his battling hordes of enemies)\n\n \n\n5. Some Corsair support, literally anything, a mercenary/pirate for hire similar to the Dwarf but for tactics reassures. Or maybe a Cutless weapon (after declaring character as a defender [or after it takes damage instead] exhaust to ready character) and/or her throwing knives (exhaust attached character to attach this card to an enemy, deal that enemy 2 damage, at the end of each round deal it an additional 2 damage, after enemy is defeated exhaust a character to attach throwing knives onto that character instead of discarding it)\n\n \n\n6.  Huorn - expensive ally that you place into the staging area and you can exhaust to deal 1 damage to an enemy that is placed in the staging area to replicate their part in The Battle of Helm's Deep, a forest that destroys enemies that enter them. Could also have a similar effect with when an enemy engages you exhaust to deal 1 damage but I like the idea of a staging area Ally.\n\n \n\n7. Anduril, guarded weapon that gives Aragorn a boost for having all four different resource icons.\n\n \n\n8. Aragorn ally, it's about time we got an Aragorn ally that could help out in fellowship decks. He could be Spirit, Leadership or neutral and grant +1 Willpower to heroes or unique characters. If they made him spirit then you could have a MOTK replacement for the lackluster hero one. \n\n \n\n9. Trebuchet or Ballista Ally that can attack into the staging area.\n\n \n\n10.  Contract for all trait theme boosting, something like you can only include allies and heroes with the same trait from the following list: (Rohan, Gondor, Noldor, Silvan, Dale, Eagles, Ents, Woodman, Dunedain, Dwarf, Beorning, Hobbit, Outlands, Harad)\n\nExhaust this card to choose 2 of the following: reduce the cost of the next ally you play this phase by 1, return an ally from your discard pile to your hand, or draw a card.\n\n \n\n11. Alliance Contract - All heroes and allies in your deck can only contain two traits from the following list: Rohan, Gondor, Noldor, Silvan, Dale, Woodman, Dunedain, Dwarf, Hobbit, Harad.\n\nFor the remainder of the quest, all heroes and allies in play are treated as having both of the chosen traits. (This one would require some playtesting but would be super cool!)\n\n \n\n12. Contract for playing with only two heroes, maybe one that lets you search your deck for two cards and add them to your hand, (or cost of 1 or less cards and put them into play)\n \n\n13. Player card versions for the other saga treasure/boon cards."}]}
