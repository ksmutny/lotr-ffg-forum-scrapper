Determine damage.\nRepeat for all enemies attacking.\n\n \n\nIt seems that Grimbeorn remains an elligible defender since he never exhausts in defending, and with his 10 HP, he can weather all four trolls, which for me freed up everyone else to attack - my threat climbed as the fight went on due to limited questing. Legolas got the required progress token on the quest by defeating an enemy, so when the last troll died, the quest was completed.\n\nIf I'm missing something, please feel free to let me know.

If you look at the rule book section on player attacks (p. 20), you'll notice it says a player must exhaust at least one ready character to declare an attack, and can declare one (and only one) attack against each enemy with which he or she is engaged. It does NOT say that a given character is limited to one attack per round or per phase.\n\nSo, if you control Boromir and are engaged with, say, three Muck Adders, Boromir could be used to attack all three during your player attack step (readying between each attack thanks to his ability). However, he could NOT attack the same Muck Adder twice within a given combat phase.\n\nIn the Brand example, say you exhaust your Prince Imrahil to attack an Eastern Crows with which you are engaged. Your ally lends Brand's ranged support to the attack (remember, ranged doesn't allow him to initiate attacks during your attack step; it only lets him JOIN attacks that you yourself declare). The Crows are toast, and Brand's controller chooses to ready Imrahil. Since it is still your attack step, you can use Imrahil to attack any other enemy with which you are engaged.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59556-grimbeorn-the-old/?do=findComment&comment=585114","commentId":585114,"userName":"Captain Poe","timestamp":1327581732,"content":"Boromir is scary... i never realized what people were talking about.

Then because it is still the same player's turn he could use Aragorn to attack again.\n\nAlso, if you had Unexpected Courage on a character you could attack, ready him, attack again (a different enemy because you cannot attack the same enemy twice in a turn).
