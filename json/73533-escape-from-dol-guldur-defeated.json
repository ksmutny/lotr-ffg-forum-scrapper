Only one \"player\" with a threat over 40.\n\nGotta say, if you have the mental energy - or the table space ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] - to play 4-handed, this seems to be the best way to go. I never got near even finishing Quest Card 2B while playing solo or 2-handed. As was my goal, I used only the Core Set cards, 3 heros and all their corresponding sphere cards per \"hand\".\n\nIf this quest is really kicking you in the teeth - as it was me - give this play style a shot. I lost my first try at it, but not by a lot. Second time round = victory!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73533-escape-from-dol-guldur-defeated/?do=findComment&comment=717084","commentId":717084,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1351654736,"content":"Should be doable with 2-handed as well.\n\nAlready did the core cycle 2-player style on nightmare myselfgui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] (which concludes with Escape from Dol Guldur)"}]}
