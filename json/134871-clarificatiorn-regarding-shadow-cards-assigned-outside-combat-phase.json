During this attack, are there some steps that allow me to do one or more actions?\n\n \n\n3) The shadow card is discarded at the end of this attack? Or it remains assigned to the enemy until the end of the next combat phase, where the shadow cards are discarded (as rules)?\n\nI think that the card remain assigned, because I have not found a rule that says to discard this shadow card.\n\nSo that shadow card will give again his bonus during the combat phase (for example a shadow card that gives +2 in attack value for the first attack, continues to give his bonus during the \"normal\" combat phase).\n\n \n\nWhat do you think?\n\n \n\nThank you in advance\n\nEdited February 13, 2015 by Emilius"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/134871-clarificatiorn-regarding-shadow-cards-assigned-outside-combat-phase/?do=findComment&comment=1448268","commentId":1448268,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1423862002,"content":"The FAQ is your friend for these questions.\n\n \n\n(1.26) Enemy attacks outside of the combat phase\nIf an enemy attacks outside of the combat phase, it is\nstill dealt a shadow card at the beginning of the attack.\nThen follow the 4 steps under Phase 6 “Combat” in the\nrules.
