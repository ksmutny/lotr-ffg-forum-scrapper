I have not yet started mixing and matching decks yet. I just got my butt handed to me in a 2 player match, and was thinking it would be impossible to beat the quest solo.  I have checked a few threads and forums, and everything i see suggests that you beat the quest with a custom deck, and most seem to place it as the harded or 2nd hardest solo quest available.\n\nIs beating it with a premade deck out of the question? Is success so dependent on luck that its not even worth attempting?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58569-escaping-dol-guldur-with-a-premade-deck/?do=findComment&comment=575855","commentId":575855,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1325898333,"content":"i just do not understand why anyone even wants to use pre-made decks... also the answer is no.. probably not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58569-escaping-dol-guldur-with-a-premade-deck/?do=findComment&comment=575917","commentId":575917,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1325920001,"content":"booored said:\n\n \n\ni just do not understand why anyone even wants to use pre-made decks... also the answer is no.. probably not.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nagreed, however pre-made is the only way to go for the first few games, until you get enough experience,  however captain poe, my advice to you would be to start deck building if you want to go for the hard ones, otherwise things get pretty difficult, yes there are some on here who refuse to deck build, but the vast majority prefer to do so, and this starts to open up many options\n\nas for guldur, i have not beaten it solo, it is the hardest, worse than the shadows of mirkwood finale- return to mirkwood, so i do not think it would be possible\n\n \n\nhave you tried anduin yet? couldnt remember if you had or not...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58569-escaping-dol-guldur-with-a-premade-deck/?do=findComment&comment=576064","commentId":576064,"userName":"Trantor3","timestamp":1325949790,"content":"Don't bother trying.

I enjoy trying, even though it is quite difficult. Having one hero MIA, and then being hit with the treachery that makes another stay exhausted unless you pay two resources is brutal. \n\nI am confident that it can be done, should the right cards be pulled. And, as I say, I have tried it 5-7 times, and came pretty close once. So, it is not inconceivable, just very difficult. \n\nThat said, I enjoy the difficulty of this game. I think that for the developers, it is far better to err on the side of too difficult than risk making the game too easy. "}]}
