Shadow cards are delt face down from the encounter deck at the very beginning of Combat Phase, and revealed later when the enemy makes it's actual attack.\n\nCorrect me if I'm wrong, but you appear to be positing that Black Riders Frodo can cancel a shadow card (and presumably get a new one dealt in its place).\n\nThis is untrue. In the terminology of the game, shadow cards are not revealed—instead, as the Rules Reference puts it [6.4.2]:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> The active player flips the attacking enemy's shadow card faceup and resolves any shadow effect the card might have.\n\n(Emphasis added.) A card is only revealed when the word \"reveal\" is actually involved (as per, e.g., this FAQ entry [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule266]).\n\nEdited June 10 by sappidus"}]}
