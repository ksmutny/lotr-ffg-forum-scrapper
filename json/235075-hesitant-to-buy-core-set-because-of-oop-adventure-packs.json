From what I have heard you dont NEED them all or play them in order but the experience is much better if you do. So I am wondering if I should just skip base set and move on to the second base set and the darrowdwelf cycle. ANy opinions? thanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/235075-hesitant-to-buy-core-set-because-of-oop-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=2510006","commentId":2510006,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1479757138,"content":"You have to have the Core Set to play anything else. The adventure packs like dwarrowdelf require their expansion (khazad-dum) and the Core set.\n\n \n\nI would recommend the Core set and any Mirkwood expansions you want that are available. You'll spend enough time with it, learning rules, deckbuilding and trying the scenarios that by the time you are ready, the remaining Mirkwwod APs should be back.

Save the encounter cards for when you have the whole cycle and can enjoy it in full. And also remember that the Hobbit saga boxes go very well with Khazad-Dûm/Dwarrowdelf."}]}
