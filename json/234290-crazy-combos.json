When they pass it back, (+2, -2). So you keep passing until P1 reaches 49 (or P2 reaches 0), then reset P1 with Lore Aragorn. P1 is at starting and P2 is well below his starting threat.\n\nEdited November 8, 2016 by Kakita Shiro"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/234290-crazy-combos/?do=findComment&comment=2494287","commentId":2494287,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1478629284,"content":"> I should also add, please explain how it is broken, the wandering Took one doesn't make sense to me.

Steward of Gondor is usually included, but can be considered optional.\n\n \n\nOr Resourceful in lieu of Steward of Gondor. And Song of Wisdom and Burning Brand as another optional bonus. And you can add a lot more to make Boromir more versatile (Song of Travel and Lay of Nimrodel to give him the occasional monstrous quest boost, Dunedain Cache or one of the bows to give him Ranged, Dunedain Signal or Arwen to give him Sentinel etc.).\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, I think some scenarios practically require the use of the core part of this combo (Boromir/Blood of Numenor/Gondorian Fire/Resourceful or Steward of Gondor). Has anyone successfully defeated The Three Trials, straight solo progression-style, without using the above combo along with Aragorn (Lore) and Glorfindel (Spirit)? If yes, I'd be curious to know how. If any of the combo cards were nerfed, could the scenario (under the conditions mentioned above) still be beaten?\n\n \n\nI'm about to try Nin-in-Eilph straight solo progression style and have a feeling the same may apply there... but I'm not asking for confirmation, tips or suggestions on that one!!!

Should've known there were other ways.\n\n \n\nClearly proves your superior deck building skills, and the fact that I've had blinders on as a result of not playing nearly as often as I used to, which has hampered mine. And your choice of heroes/cards made me realize I had been further limiting myself... while I own all of the LotR saga boxes, they're all still shrink-wrapped because I've decided to set them aside until I can play the entire saga... so no access to Merry or Dagger of Westernnesse, etc. But that's on me, not you... certainly wouldn't have wanted to add another \"excessive\" restriction to the challenge.  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nEDIT: Thanks for taking the time to take up the challenge, Pocket Wraith, and especially to do a full write-up of your sessions.\n\nEdited November 22, 2016 by TwiceBornh"}]}
