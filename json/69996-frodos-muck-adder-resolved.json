If you use Frodo's ability to raise threat instead of taking damage from a Muck Adder, then the Adder has not actually damaged Frodo and it's ability will not trigger.\nCheers,\nCaleb\n\nthanks for the response"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69996-frodos-muck-adder-resolved/?do=findComment&comment=683039","commentId":683039,"userName":"Shockeffect","timestamp":1346072485,"content":"Well its good to know for sure now how Frodo's ability is meant to be used.  I just hope (crossing my fingers) that FFG will work on their wording of game text with a bit more care.  Thanks for asking."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69996-frodos-muck-adder-resolved/?do=findComment&comment=683064","commentId":683064,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1346073906,"content":"I think that's what we were expecting.
