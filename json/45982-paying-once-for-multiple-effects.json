Since it is an action it is completed fully before you can take the next action. So you discard a card to get +1 Willpower and then that card is in the discard and you can not discard that card again. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45982-paying-once-for-multiple-effects/?do=findComment&comment=461089","commentId":461089,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1304086284,"content":"A general rule I've seen for most games is that you cannot pay one cost and trigger two effects that require the same price.
