I assume he does because his text is the same as theirs, but the rules sheet for Conflict At Carrock doesn't say for certain. Can anyone confirm if this is the case? Thanks in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77580-grimbeorn-vs-arwen-and-wilyador/?do=findComment&comment=748844","commentId":748844,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1358396271,"content":"Grimbeorn joins the first player as an ally.  The other two are controlled by the first player. \n\n \n\nFFG clarified sometime ago.  Join the first player means he stays with him for the rest of the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77580-grimbeorn-vs-arwen-and-wilyador/?do=findComment&comment=749138","commentId":749138,"userName":"GongShowHost","timestamp":1358433508,"content":"Oh man that stinks!
