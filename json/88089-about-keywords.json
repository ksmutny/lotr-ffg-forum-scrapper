Those where there's keywords would almost have to occur every time. Anyone knows of a quest where you are asked to draw a card and just ad it, no reveal it? A quest where you have the risk drawing/finding a card that actually has a keyword on it I mean :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88089-about-keywords/?do=findComment&comment=835113","commentId":835113,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1376059251,"content":"ah, i think you are correct there leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88089-about-keywords/?do=findComment&comment=835114","commentId":835114,"userName":"Nyck","timestamp":1376059309,"content":"@thomasschmidt\n\nWell, take the spiders of mirkwood in the core set. \"On a chosen path\" each player adds a spider to the stage and some of them have \"when revealed\" effects on them... \n\nEdited August 9, 2013 by Nyck"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88089-about-keywords/?do=findComment&comment=835182","commentId":835182,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1376063035,"content":"> @thomasschmidt\n> \n> Well, take the spiders of mirkwood in the core set. \"On a chosen path\" each player adds a spider to the stage and some of them have \"when revealed\" effects on them...\n\nOh, that's right.
