Action: Spend 1 resource from the attached hero's resource pool to give attached hero +1 defewnse for each resource in its resource pool until the end of the phase. (Limit once per phase.)\n\n \n\nThis attachment does not specify that it has to be put on a Spirit hero, so as long as I can resource match to actually play the card from my hand can I put it on any Gondor or Dunedain hero?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95942-putting-attachments-on-charactersheroes-of-another-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=940845","commentId":940845,"userName":"soldat7","timestamp":1388373961,"content":"Yes.
