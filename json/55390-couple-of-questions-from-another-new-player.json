You can play actions before/after any step and you can play actions DURING any green step.\n\n2. As many as you want (and can afford to pay for).\n\n3. Do you mean replaced with another attachment or do you meant moved to another character? You can place as many non-restricted attachments on a hero as you want. You can also place up to 2 restricted attachments. You cannot move attachments between characters unless you have a specific card effect that allows it.\n\n4. All allies and heroes are characters.\n\n5. You may only defend with a single character. You may not do a combined defense except as allowed by specific card effects (such as Stand Together)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55390-couple-of-questions-from-another-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=548086","commentId":548086,"userName":"Nickster2","timestamp":1319725968,"content":"Thank you very much for the quick response, all clear now and ready to play :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55390-couple-of-questions-from-another-new-player/?do=findComment&comment=548095","commentId":548095,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1319727069,"content":"Nickster said:\n\nHey everyone,\n\nstarted playing this game and really enjoying it!

Pretty much, yes.\n\n2. As many as he/she wants.\n\n3. Are you asking about if it is possible to move an attachment from one character to another?  If so, then not really.  Some attachments have the ability to do this (Dunedain ___ comes to mind), but otherwise there's no way to do this.\n\n4.  Characters are Heroes or Allies.  Creature is a trait, much like Hobbit, Orc, Silvan, Item, Condition.  Traits have no effect on the rules unless a card refers to them.  Since an Eagle is an Ally, it is a Character.\n\n5.Stand Together is the only card that lets you do this.  Normally, if you defend an attack, you can only defend with one character."}]}
