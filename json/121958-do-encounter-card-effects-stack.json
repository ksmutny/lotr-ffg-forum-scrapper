I'm really hoping it's not true but do location, treachery, and enemy effects stack? For example a location card that has archery. Would 2 of the same location have double the archery damage I need to deal to my characters? Or a treachery that lowers attack and defense of my characters by 2. Would 2 of the same reduce my attack and defense by 4?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121958-do-encounter-card-effects-stack/?do=findComment&comment=1261435","commentId":1261435,"userName":"Skeezix","timestamp":1410653708,"content":"Unless it says otherwise, yes. As in your example two things with Archery 2 would mean you have to assign 4 points of archery damage."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121958-do-encounter-card-effects-stack/?do=findComment&comment=1261438","commentId":1261438,"userName":"GondorianFire","timestamp":1410653876,"content":"Right, thank you."}]}
