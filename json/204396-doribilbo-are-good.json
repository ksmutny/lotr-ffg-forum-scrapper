That deck is the combat deck and it works a lot, very well, in 2 players, when the other player has a good quester deck, like spirit-Caldara.\n\n \n\nI have won easily my first quest-testers, with epic moments include:\n\nJourney Anduin: Bilbo defending and Dori defeating enemies like 2 trolls, the Adder, the Uthack...\n\n7th level: Dori defeated a troll\n\nMassing Osgiliath: Dori killed .... Witch King! (in only 1 shot)\n\n \n\nI was very surprised with those results... I find Dori very versatil: first rounds helping Bilbo while he is building his own tank-machine. And after, he attacks with weapons and KhazadKhazad events, and sometimes helping with centinel, defending enemies from other players.\n\n \n\nAnother cards to keep Bilbo safe:\n\n- First of them: Burning Brand, for sure\n\n- And second: Fast Hitchs, of course\n\n- Another cards: song mocking, close call, erebor boots, ring mail, gondor shield, half determination\n\n \n\n- The drawing cards is not problem: Master Forge is awesome here, the same Bilbo helps a lot, Gather, Advice (the other hero is lore Pippin), etc.\n\n- Probably the card id like and i dont have is Unexpected or Miruvor for Dori (the other player may play them for him ^^)\n\n \n\nIn 2 players mode, this is a good combat deck, while the other players plays a good quester deck (as i said) like caldaras decks.\n\nEdited March 3, 2016 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204396-doribilbo-are-good/?do=findComment&comment=2082499","commentId":2082499,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1457020994,"content":"I'd be interested in the deck list here.  seems really neat and not something I would have ever come up with."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204396-doribilbo-are-good/?do=findComment&comment=2082523","commentId":2082523,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1457021801,"content":"Sounds like the enemies engaged with you would pile up if Dori is exhausting to buff Bilbo instead of killing them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204396-doribilbo-are-good/?do=findComment&comment=2082952","commentId":2082952,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1457033415,"content":"Yes, Shiro, it seems too so to me, but when you play it happens otherwise.

By the time you have all four attachments on him, and only Herugrim is restricted for him, you'd have someone that can quest for 2/3+, ready from successful questing, defend for 4+, ready and gain a resource, and then attack for 5-6+.  And any willpower buff you can put on him adds to questing and attack simultaneously.\n\n \n\nDespite TaTheoden's higher base willpower, I favor SpTheoden as a partner.  He's got a sphere match for his toys, a discount on the mostly-spirit Rohirrim (including a mount-fetching ally), and can put the extra resource to good use in paying for Rohirrim.\n\n \n\nIn fact, I wonder if a SpTheoden/Dori solo Rohirrim deck might not even function well in solo.  Combine useful leadership/tactics attachments with Rohan allies, and I think you could get to Super Theoden in a hurry.  Honour Guards, Raven-winged helms, and song of mocking could all help the defense always pay off.  Rohan's solid on questing and attack, so a two-hero combo to provide solid defense could really go far.  I'm thinking Balin for the leadership hero, to provide some emergency shadow protection for Theoden.  Still, with no lore and two key attachments, getting to the key attachments could prove difficult.\n\n \n\nOf course, when we're introducing multiple other cards into the combo to make things awesome, we should also consider another possible partner -- Lore nobles, natural burning brand targets and in the card draw sphere.  While you can't give noble outside of the saga, you can give sentinel to any hero with the 1-cost leadership signal Dunedain Signal.  There's four Lore nobles:\n\n \n\nDenethor (3 defense, gondor)\n\nElrond (3 defense, noldor)\n\nFaramir (2 defense, gondor)\n\nGlorfindel (1 defense, noldor)\n\n \n\nWhile you can't have the turn 1 Mardil/Day's Rising combo immediately, Elrond and Denethor would start at 5 defense with no attachments at all.  And while neither is a great attacker, but Denethor always has a use for his extra action, while Elrond always does if he has Vilya attached.  Of the four, I like Denethor best as a partner, since he can use Gondorian Shield for +2D, he doesn't need an attachment to make post-defense readiness worthwhile, and  he's five less threat than Elrond.  On the other hand, if you ever get the combo set up on Elrond, he can use the resources to pay for any ally, and Vilya well help you go through the deck faster.\n\n \n\nAnyway, that's my thinking on the best way to make Dori shine, not that Seastan is going to put Dori into a deck anytime soon.  I'm still playing through the quests with my original hero lineups, so it'll be a while until I put one of these together, maybe another great-with-Dori card will come out in the meantime."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204396-doribilbo-are-good/?do=findComment&comment=2084768","commentId":2084768,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1457118392,"content":"Sure, good idea.
