Using road goes on forever to chain a few side quests and I has an extra hero a few turns in!\n\nThis cycle is aweomse because we are getting this fun new haldan archetype which I can't wait for, I'll probably proxy him soon to try him, We got thalion, and we got Thranduil to liven up our silvan decks, and mpre support for Dale and eagles, as well as the beorning archetype. \n\nStrong support for old and development of new decks, it's awesome. \n\n \n\n "}]}
