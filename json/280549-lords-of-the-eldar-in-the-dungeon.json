In my 3rd game, early on (when I was aware of how brutal of a quest it was)  I was playing a 2 spirit one lore hero  noldor deck, and I saw my 2  will of the wests early. I was getting punished pretty bad and tossed them for various effects since I thought I'd die before being decked.\n\nSomehow I survived until halfway through stage 2 (which I hadn't even gotten to yet in the other plays) and the danger of threating out was the largest  of many dangers.   I ended up in a strange situation.  I had no cards in my deck so every round I could draw lords of Eldar, discard to arwen, play with the 3 resources I had, placing it back on the bottom of my deck. I played around 6 rounds like this somehow avoiding the doomed cards and pulled a victory with my waning noldor forces. ( I let Galdor go as a captive and lost several useless lore resources for the last quest cards effect)\n\n \n\nKind of a cool hail Mary, lots of Yolo style questing at the end haha.  That's all, just thought it was an odd ball occurrence "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280549-lords-of-the-eldar-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=3432088","commentId":3432088,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1533644272,"content":"I think you have to rescue the captive hero before to win, but I have't played the quest myself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280549-lords-of-the-eldar-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=3432233","commentId":3432233,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1533651927,"content":"I’ve played it twice yesterday 2 handed for the first time.  Both times made it to stage three were I got overwhelmed both times.\n\ngood job beating the quest!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280549-lords-of-the-eldar-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=3432511","commentId":3432511,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1533662554,"content":"> 5 hours ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> I think you have to rescue the captive hero before to win, but I have't played the quest myself.\n\nI did, I was just adding in that I used the lore hero as Captive since his resources  were useless "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280549-lords-of-the-eldar-in-the-dungeon/?do=findComment&comment=3432514","commentId":3432514,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1533662676,"content":"> 2 hours ago, Ywingscum said:\n> \n> I’ve played it twice yesterday 2 handed for the first time.  Both times made it to stage three were I got overwhelmed both times.\n> \n> good job beating the quest!!!\n\nFunny we both played it yesterday ha!\n\nYeah it's crazy hard, the encounter deck just spews out cards at an alarming rate and it also takes away your cards so it's an uphill battle but I really enjoyed it"}]}
