Good Harvest lets you use other sphered resources to pay for cards of a named sphere, it does not make them resources of that sphere.

Gandalf's text reads, \"When playing a card this way...\", implying that he has the extra icons only for playing the card. But Heed the Dream has already been played, I would think, by the time you start resolving its text.

Here is my email/his response:\n\n \n\n \n\n> 1) If I use Gandalf's ability to play Mithrandir's Advice off the top of my deck, do I get to consider Gandalf to have a printed lore icon when resolving the action on the card? In other words, when does the phrase \"when playing a card this way\" stop working? Is it when I've finished paying the cost of the card, or is it when I finish resolving the text on the card?\n> \n>  \n> 2) If Gandalf's icons persist until I've finished resolving the text on the card, does this mean a card like Quick Strike can provide a unique \"nested\" action window where Gandalf's resources can be spent on sphere-specific action cards played from the hand\n\n \n\n> 1. Gandalf’s added icons disappear after you have fully resolved playing the top card of your deck. So, when you play Mithrandir’s Advice, Gandalf is considered to have the printed lore icon. \n> \n> 2. Quick Strike’s ability resolves immediately, granting you an attack. Quick Strike’s ability is not considered to be active throughout the entirety of the attack, so Gandalf would not have the tactics icon for more the instant it takes to play the event.\n\nEdited August 1, 2016 by Seastan"}]}
