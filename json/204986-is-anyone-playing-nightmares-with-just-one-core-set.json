I do still only have 1 copy of the 1 of cards but honestly the 2 of cards are far far far FAR more important and better than the one of cards. Many of the one of cards are either extremely situational, very high cost or are unique. The two of cards include cards like Steward, Feint, Test of Will, Hasty Stroke, Sneak Attack, Greeting, Forest Snare, Blade of Gondolin, Northern Tracker, Will of the West, Faramir, Ever Vigilant, thicket of spears and quick strike all of which can be utterly amazing in the right deck and only two of these cards are unique..... \n\nThe only x1 cards I would really worry about are UC and for certain decks/builds or solo play Henamarth Riversong. Celebrian's Stone I suppose is another one for certain Aragorn decks (next to useless in mine as Scorpigorn doesn't want more willpower and gaining the spirit sphere is useless to that deck) but honestly many of the x1 cards are very average and it is many of the x2 cards that you need a third copy of to make decks that have a bit more power and bite and have the potential to beat nightmare quests.\n\nLong story short, I personally would not play nightmare without at least a third copy of all the x2 cards in the core set or it will be far too punishing. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204986-is-anyone-playing-nightmares-with-just-one-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=2092400","commentId":2092400,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1457530076,"content":"You could use something like this deck: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175783-one-deck-to-rule-them-all-nightmare-edition/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175783-one-deck-to-rule-them-all-nightmare-edition/]\n\n \n\n(Take a look at the end of the decklist for the single-core substitutions).\n\n \n\nIt can beat almost any Nightmare quest even in the single-core configuration. I think it's mainly due to the fact that Galadriel's Mirror can compensate for not having 3x or the key cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204986-is-anyone-playing-nightmares-with-just-one-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=2092665","commentId":2092665,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1457539072,"content":"Sleeves and proxies!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204986-is-anyone-playing-nightmares-with-just-one-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=2092826","commentId":2092826,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1457543889,"content":"I got a second core set awhile ago, and it helped a lot, but I don,t think I need a 3rd core set; I'd ratter spend the money to buy a few AP's."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204986-is-anyone-playing-nightmares-with-just-one-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=2093858","commentId":2093858,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1457587617,"content":"A second core isn't that important for NM unless you're playing Spirit.
