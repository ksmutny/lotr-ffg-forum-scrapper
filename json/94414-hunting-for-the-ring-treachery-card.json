There are several cards that are worded somewhat poorly and this is one of them. The \"spirit\" of the card surely means you have to meet the conditions of the first option, ie. be engaged with a Nazgul, to choose option one, and if you aren't engaged with a Nazgul you must choose option 2."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94414-hunting-for-the-ring-treachery-card/?do=findComment&comment=928738","commentId":928738,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1386835157,"content":"Got an answer from Caleb:\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYou cannot choose an option that you cannot fulfill.
