After questing I would make the Old forest road the active location, thereby readying a hero. Spider comes down due to threat, and attacks and I defend with the hero.\n\nRound 2, if questing does not satisfy the requirements to put sufficient tokens on the travel location to discard it. Can I travel to that location again? Could I ready a hero?\n\nSo in a 2 player game, would only the first player get to travel to that location, even when the 2 player becomes the active player?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71466-how-many-times-can-you-travel-to-an-active-location/?do=findComment&comment=697845","commentId":697845,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1348219995,"content":"hey\n\nthe location stays active until cleared, so no you cannot re-travel\n\nyou can of course re travel if the location is forced back into the staging area (possible in some quests and cards)\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71466-how-many-times-can-you-travel-to-an-active-location/?do=findComment&comment=697913","commentId":697913,"userName":"mustardayonnaiz","timestamp":1348227131,"content":" Thanks! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71466-how-many-times-can-you-travel-to-an-active-location/?do=findComment&comment=697951","commentId":697951,"userName":"Abelard3","timestamp":1348230133,"content":"Just to say, pure tactics is very difficult to play with because you don't get very much willpower."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71466-how-many-times-can-you-travel-to-an-active-location/?do=findComment&comment=697963","commentId":697963,"userName":"mustardayonnaiz","timestamp":1348233486,"content":"Abelard said:\n\nJust to say, pure tactics is very difficult to play with because you don't get very much willpower.\n\n\n\nOk good, I just got this game and thought I was doing something wrong, I switched to Lore last night and got a little further than with the tactics deck. The allies contribute willpower and the snares are nice. But I still can't seem to get my threat to stay under 50. It seems you either commit all your characters to the quest to maximize progress, but then you have no cards for defense and your heroes die. \n\nI think I just need to play more…..but even though I lost like 10 or more games, it still is really fun to play. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71466-how-many-times-can-you-travel-to-an-active-location/?do=findComment&comment=698026","commentId":698026,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1348238789,"content":"once you've made a location active, you can ignore its threat when you're counting up all the threat in the staging area for questing. are you remembering to do that?
