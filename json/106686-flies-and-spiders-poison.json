Same subject, slightly different question.\n\n \n\nIf an effect tells you to give a poison to a character you control, can you give it to an unconscious character, or does the recipient have to be conscious?\n\n \n\nIf you can give it to an unconscious character, what happens when they have as many poison as hit points? Do the poison cards get discarded again and they stay unconscious? Do they die?\n\n \n\nI have to say I find this quest the hardest in terms of rule clarifications. I seem to spend more time checking rules than actually playing!\n\n \n\nAnyway, thanks in advance!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106686-flies-and-spiders-poison/?do=findComment&comment=1431306","commentId":1431306,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1422891999,"content":"From the rules insert, and reiterated on the quest cards themselves, it says:\n\n \n\n\"Unconscious characters cannot quest, attack, defend, collect resources, trigger abilities, be poisoned, or ready (except by effects that target unconscious characters).\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106686-flies-and-spiders-poison/?do=findComment&comment=1431430","commentId":1431430,"userName":"Chaos101","timestamp":1422897034,"content":"Thank you GrandSpleen for pointing out the obvious!\n\n \n\nI was having a mare yesterday with this quest and couldn't see the words for the writing!!\n\nI must have read that sentence at least 3 or 4 times!\n\n \n\nMany thanks again.
