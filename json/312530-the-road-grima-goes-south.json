We have the answer to ‘Who is Tom Bombadil?’ [“He is.”], ‘Do Balrogs have wings?’ [As physical manifestations of Maiar, they could if they wanted so it makes no difference] and ‘Was the prophecy of the Witch-king’s demise a self-fulfilling one?’ [No.] But the one that yet remains unanswered is ‘What if Grima Wormtongue had joined the Fellowship of the Ring?’ Well fear not, for within I have the answer.

I weirdly have a special place in my heart got Grima and Saruman because they were the only human heroes amongst a sea of “Name that Orc” commanders in the game boy advance The Third Age awesome LOTR strategy game.
