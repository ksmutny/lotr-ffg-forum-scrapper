In the Hobbit boxes there are Treasure cards which bring those two boxes together as somewhat \"campaign\" as you \"unlock\" certain cards to use in the later quests but thats it so it's pretty lame.\n\n \n\nAs for the LOTR Campaign mode there are good and bad cards you earn, dead heroes can't be played later and therefore all later quests from those sagas are effected which is huge considering there will be at least 18 quests (3 from the 6 boxes)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135412-campaign-mode-which-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1456922","commentId":1456922,"userName":"Marten","timestamp":1424424579,"content":"Thanks\n\nEdited February 20, 2015 by Marten"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/135412-campaign-mode-which-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=1457961","commentId":1457961,"userName":"Solaufein","timestamp":1424475398,"content":"Oh man, I hadn't realized they were all so interconnected.
