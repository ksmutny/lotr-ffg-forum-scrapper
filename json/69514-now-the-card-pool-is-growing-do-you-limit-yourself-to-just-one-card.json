If you are worried about what to do with duplicate uniques, there are plenty of cards in each sphere that will put them to use (Daeron's Runes, Hama, Erestor, Trollshaw Scout, Protector of Lorien, etc.). If there is a card that has a similar but better effect, I would replace that better card with the worse card that has a similar effect, if that makes sense. I used to play with Gleowine, but I don't really build with him anymore because of cards that aren't unique like Daeron's Runes or Master of the Forge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69514-now-the-card-pool-is-growing-do-you-limit-yourself-to-just-one-card/?do=findComment&comment=678001","commentId":678001,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1345509291,"content":" I only have a single core set and I try to keep multiple playable decks on hand so I can just do a pick-up game with my friends whenever we want.

It is only with very few cards that I use duplicates, and I don't think I have ever had a card in triplicate in my deck. As has been pointed out, it makes the game more interesting to have a wider variety of cards come up, plus it adds to the suspense, or whatever, having only one Gandalf, because you only play him when you really need him, very thematic-like!\n\nBut yeah, it probably also explains my dismally poor record at completing quests…"}]}
