Multiple filter values can be included separated by a comma\n- includes the negation of a given filter. Multiple filter values can be excluded separated by a comma\n\nFor example:\n\n+sphere=Lore,Leadership will include only cards from the Lore OR Leadership sphere\n-sphere=Spirit will exclude cards from the Spirit sphere\n\n \n\nYou can mix these special filters (prefixed with + or -) with regular queries. For example:\n\nAragorn +sphere:Leadership,Lore -sphere:Fellowship,Tactics\n\nThe above would search for Aragorn and filter for Leadership and Lore spheres, but exclude the Fellowship and Tactics spheres.\n\nThese special tokens can be also be combined with existing basic filters from the drop down menus. For example, you could choose 2 from the Cost drop down and Ally from the card type drop down, then enter the following query:\n\n+sphere:Spirit,Tactics -keyword:Ranged +trait:Silvan,Noldor\n\nThis will return all 2 cost Spirit and Tactics allies with the Silvan or Noldor trait that do NOT have the Ranged keyword. I will have a post on the blog soon, with full details of the advanced search syntax, but I wanted to make the announcement here and encourage people to try it out.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125224-hall-of-beorn-card-search-fog-on-the-barrow-downs-w-images-and-advanced-search/?do=findComment&comment=1305071","commentId":1305071,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1413787828,"content":"You're the best!

Numeric filters now support ranges with a - character. For example: +rcost:2,3,4,5 can instead be written as +rcost:2-5\n\n2. Numeric filters now support < and > comparison. For example: +rcost:>2 returns cards with a resource cost greater than 2.\n\n3. Added a unique filter. It works just like the unique checkbox, except that it can be negated.\n\nHere is an example that uses all of these new features:\n\n+trait:silvan +rcost:2-4, +atk:>1 -unique\n\nThis returns all non-unique Silvan cards with a resource cost between 2 and 4 (inclusive) and an attack strength greater than 1.\n\nEnjoy, and please do give feedback if you find anything that is not working or think of a way that advanced search can be improved."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125224-hall-of-beorn-card-search-fog-on-the-barrow-downs-w-images-and-advanced-search/?do=findComment&comment=1308951","commentId":1308951,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1414055632,"content":"Just uploaded all the old forest artwork for anyone who doesn't have it yet and wants to see the art :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] All the card text spoilers are already up on Hall of Beorn card search so I didn't include the 2A stages.
