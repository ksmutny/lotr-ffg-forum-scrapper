If you look in the back of the rulebook at the turn summary, any part of it that's green you can take actions freely during it. The red bits you have to wait until they're done before taking any actions. In the case of combat there's additional detail in that there are action windows after each step of resolving an attack.\n\nSo in your example, yes you can exhaust a Daughter of the Nimrodel to heal a hero during the combat phase, and this can save their life if you do it in the middle of them defending an attack which would otherwise kill them, because you have multiple action windows before you reach the point of actually placing damage. One exception however is that if the hero would be killed by the shadow effect (as in a direct damage like the Hummerhorns shadow), the shadow effect resolves immediately when you flip over the shadow card, so in that circumstance the hero is dead before you get to the action window (and because your defender is gone you now have an undefended attack for even more hero-killing fun). Direct damage shadow effects aren't too common though, thankfully."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200132-dumb-newbie-questions-thread-for-new-guy/?do=findComment&comment=2027574","commentId":2027574,"userName":"rdw5150","timestamp":1454415641,"content":"Thanks!\n\n \n\n<SIGH> I guess I could have saved poor Denethor :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png]\n\n \n\nPeace\n\n \n\nRoger"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200132-dumb-newbie-questions-thread-for-new-guy/?do=findComment&comment=2050364","commentId":2050364,"userName":"rdw5150","timestamp":1455381055,"content":"Is there an order that I have to deal with attackers (lowest threat first, etc), or can I deal with them in any order I wish?\n\n \n\nOr is it all simultaneous?\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200132-dumb-newbie-questions-thread-for-new-guy/?do=findComment&comment=2050379","commentId":2050379,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1455381575,"content":"Any order."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200132-dumb-newbie-questions-thread-for-new-guy/?do=findComment&comment=2064558","commentId":2064558,"userName":"rdw5150","timestamp":1456093437,"content":"Hi!\n\n \n\nOK dumb question that would seem to have come up before now :rolleyes: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_rolleyes.gif]\n\n \n\nIf a card deals damage to an enemy (for instance Gandaf's ability to deal 4 damage to an enemy, or Swift Strike dealing 2), does armor reduce this damage\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200132-dumb-newbie-questions-thread-for-new-guy/?do=findComment&comment=2064580","commentId":2064580,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1456094457,"content":"An enemy or character's Defence Strength (I guess this is what you mean by armour---the value next to the shield) does not protect them from such damage.
