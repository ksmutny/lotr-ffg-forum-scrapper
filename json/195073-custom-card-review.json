My personal series is Custom Card Review, where I look for fan-mad content, primarily for this game, and discuss and review it. Here's my first episode of Custom Card Review [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1loAxkfEigU], and it features the first card from the Custom Artwork Cards [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?p=992469] thread here on this forum. Ian, from Tales from the Cards [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/] will (hopefully) be featuring my LotR content on his blog as well.\n\n \n\nI'd love to get some feedback, positive or negative, so feel free to let it all flow, though, like I say in the video, if your feedback is about whether or not you agree with my assessment of the card, please leave it on Youtube, so I can get notified and get back to you more quickly. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nThanks muchly"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195073-custom-card-review/?do=findComment&comment=1920577","commentId":1920577,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1449351785,"content":"Wow. 16 minutes to review a single card :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195073-custom-card-review/?do=findComment&comment=1920579","commentId":1920579,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1449351868,"content":"Excellent idea!

I'll be very selective, just cards that I think I can get a decent review out of, whether it's a card that I think would never be played and I want to discuss why and what could be done to fix it.... or a group of cards with a really cool synergy, or a card that is awesome but could cause some ridiculous combos and such. I certainly don't have the time to gt through every card I'm currently aware of and by the time I did, there would 3 times as many new ones... :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/195073-custom-card-review/?do=findComment&comment=1920612","commentId":1920612,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1449354074,"content":"That's fair enough.
