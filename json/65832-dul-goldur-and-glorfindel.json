I tried very many builds, and came within one questing phase on 3B without victory.  My final build and sucess was in large part due to trying to find a use for Glorifindel, as I've generally been one of the players who didn't care for the piece. I found him to be costly, and found a lack of synergy between his high quest and high attack.\n\nI played probably 20 games this weekend, and had some very close victories with Frodo, Eowin, and Bormir, but just could not pull off a victory. After growing bored of constantly tweeking and failing, I threw together a deck with Eowin, Glorfindel, and Legolas. It took a bit of fine tuning, but I eventually won, and in large part because of glorfindel. The combo of Glorfindel in conjunction with Rumour from the Earth was extremely valuable. basically, I never was able to afford anything from the lore sphere, because I spent Glorf's resource on returning RFTE to my hand every round. What it did do was give me the forsight I needed to know if I should quest with him, or save him as an attacker. It didn't always work… in particular, if a card had surge, I basically had to make a gut instinct call… but I must say that my opinion has drastically changed of him. Also in large part of him allowing the play of elrond's counsel, which is also priceless on this particular quest, and fairly hard to pull off unless you can luck out and pull an Arwin.\n\n\nI still don't think he is the best hero, but I suggest if you play him, really playing to his stregnths… which in order to do this, you have basically got to have an ability that allows you to see when to quest and when to combat. He's definitely earned some respect in my book.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65832-dul-goldur-and-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=642985","commentId":642985,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1339418211,"content":"He is A good Hero. And with Asfaloth he will get much better.\n\nGlorifindel with Ucourage, Asfaloth can quest kill and get rid of Locations every round + his is a healer.He is pretty awesome and worse his 12 threat. My favorite hero for now.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65832-dul-goldur-and-glorfindel/?do=findComment&comment=642990","commentId":642990,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1339419024,"content":"Rumour is good but Henamarth better in most of the cases I would say.
