Edit: oh dear. Played it wrong all the time!\n\nAlso, I am not a native english speaker, so I do have some issues with the second part. Translated it means \"each player has to discard a card or surge\", but there would be easier and more elegant ways to describe this. Additionally, I think it does not make much sense, from the games perspective: either all or none player will discard a card then. So I suppose it should have ment: \"If not at least one player discarded a card then surge\". But that is definitly not the result if translated.\n\nEdited February 16, 2019 by Flrbb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291017-how-do-you-play-fouled-well/?do=findComment&comment=3626253","commentId":3626253,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1550308817,"content":"> 7 hours ago, Amicus Draconis said:\n> \n> Fouled Well reads: \"When Revealed: Each player may choose and discard 1 card at random from his hand.

Basically it's an all or nothing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291017-how-do-you-play-fouled-well/?do=findComment&comment=3628765","commentId":3628765,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1550611683,"content":"I asked Caleb about this and he confirmed, all players have to discard a random card.
