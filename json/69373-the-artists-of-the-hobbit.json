I have seen some other LOTR game not sure which one it was but it had the photos of the characters from the movie and it looked really cheap. I wish I had discovered this game earlier. And I wish FFG would get more involved with people here in the UK. They have really amazing game. They would really need a good PR campaign. Board game nights once a week in local shops."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69373-the-artists-of-the-hobbit/?do=findComment&comment=676137","commentId":676137,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1345301445,"content":"agreed- the art is great in this game, and the variety is a good thing"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69373-the-artists-of-the-hobbit/?do=findComment&comment=676140","commentId":676140,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1345302706,"content":"daftpunk9050 said:\n\nI have seen some other LOTR game not sure which one it was but it had the photos of the characters from the movie and it looked really cheap. \n\n\n\nPossibly the old Decipher LotR CCG.
