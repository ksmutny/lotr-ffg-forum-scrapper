He was volunteering the entire time so he didn't have time to sit down and play through the new scenarios while he was there, thus it was the first time for all three of us when we sat down to enjoy a nice evening of Lotr Lcg ... in the middle of the week.... at 9 o'clock.\n\n \n\n \n\nSo after debating extensively about what decks we were using we got started and promptly died quickly twice in a row. Good time. Gave us a taste for the quest. So we paused, modified 2 decks, and proceeded to really give the 2nd Blackriders quest one more run for its money before going to bed to get ready for work in the morning.\n\n \n\nTwo and a half + hours later.... We finally won! \n\nWhat an epic quest... SUPER COOL and I am suuuuuper tired today."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89031-omg-length-of-quest-soooooo-long/?do=findComment&comment=847877","commentId":847877,"userName":"Samwise Gamgee","timestamp":1377219453,"content":"Looks like Black Riders is the boat!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89031-omg-length-of-quest-soooooo-long/?do=findComment&comment=848990","commentId":848990,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1377344156,"content":"How many rounds was it?

We were very tired by the end of it we went through the encounter deck at least four times but that's not saying much. Some effects make you discard until you get so many of some card type.\n\nI actually lost by threat to spiders of mirkwood because we simply could not get ungolianth to show up normally no matter how many times we blew through the encounter deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89031-omg-length-of-quest-soooooo-long/?do=findComment&comment=849304","commentId":849304,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1377376990,"content":"I don't understand.

Not that I'm aware of. It gives you the chance to pull a number of spider enemies out equal to the number of players and only once.
