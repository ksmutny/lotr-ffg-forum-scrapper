If that is also a surge then you repeat the process. \n\nI'm not exactly certain about the second part of the question. Do you mean Shadow and Actions?

Shadow effects don't cause surge to happen because only Shadow effects happen. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49821-thicket-of-spears-and-surge/?do=findComment&comment=498418","commentId":498418,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1310414603,"content":" For the second half of the surge question:\n\nYes, surge cards revealed by actions (such as Eleanor's) or Treachery cards will still active the surge rule.\n\nThe FAQ probably says it better though:\n\n(1.01) Encounter Keywords\nSurge, Doomed, and Guarded keywords should be resolved any time the card on which they occur enters play, including during setup."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49821-thicket-of-spears-and-surge/?do=findComment&comment=498523","commentId":498523,"userName":"madprof666","timestamp":1310436122,"content":" aye thats what i meant, sorry for not being clear, im quite new tob these games. and thanks for clearing that up for me"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49821-thicket-of-spears-and-surge/?do=findComment&comment=498524","commentId":498524,"userName":"madprof666","timestamp":1310436161,"content":" aye thats what i meant, sorry for not being clear, im quite new tob these games. and thanks for clearing that up for me"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49821-thicket-of-spears-and-surge/?do=findComment&comment=498526","commentId":498526,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1310436539,"content":"Apophenia said:\n\nmadprof666 said:\n\n \n\nThicket of Spears must be be paid from three Tactics heroes. \n\n \n\n \n\nOk, so unless there are 3 tactics heroes in play the card is useless?
