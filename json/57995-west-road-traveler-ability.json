If you dont have an active location she has nowhere to go! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57995-west-road-traveler-ability/?do=findComment&comment=571830","commentId":571830,"userName":"Ironmanrcm","timestamp":1325026168,"content":" Thanks, I guess that makes sense."}]}
