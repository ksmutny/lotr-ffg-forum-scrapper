This got me wondering, if I used Saruman's ability while on stage 3B to target the Nazgul (assuming it is still in the staging area) could I win without having to fight it if I complete the stage before Saruman leaves play at the end of the round? The quest never states you have to defeat the Nazgul, just that it has to be \"not in play\". Is there a difference between being \"not in play\" and \"considered out of play\", as per Saruman's response ability when he enters play?\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111351-saruman-vs-nazgul-of-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=1163694","commentId":1163694,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1405943676,"content":"Yes, we asked that in France.

Some fans speculate that this is the same morpheme as in the wizard name Radagast, though their connection between \"rada\" and \"rudu\" (red, reddish brown in OE) is a bit of a stretch.\n\n \n\nOn topic: Saruman is incredibly powerful, and the only thing stopping me from using him is that my Gondor and Rohan friends often start with a high threat."}]}
