Yeah, I'm trying to do it in the evenings after the day is done and a few nights have ended up lasting pretty late. My goal was to get through the Core set before letting others know about the attempt.

I don't care if I lose, because I enjoy so much. Now I'm on the second mission (Journey along the Anduin), and this afternoon I'm gonna make my 5th attempt, the second one in easy mode. I think easy mode is a hidden \"one play standard mode\" for one player with some quests. \n\nEdited August 30, 2014 by ruferto"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120683-new-blog-the-end-may-be-dark/?do=findComment&comment=1238657","commentId":1238657,"userName":"player1922162","timestamp":1409386697,"content":"Interesting.

I felt like I was setting up a bad standard using him twice in a row in the first three quests. I tried switching with Frodo, but it just didn't work right. And for solo, one-handed Dol Guldur, beggars can't be choosers. Can't say I won't bring him out on a future quest where low threat and high power is needed, but I'll try to set him aside for a while."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120683-new-blog-the-end-may-be-dark/?do=findComment&comment=1239208","commentId":1239208,"userName":"MightyRauros","timestamp":1409421500,"content":"The next post [http://theendmaybedark.blogspot.com]is up!
