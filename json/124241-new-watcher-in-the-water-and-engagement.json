When does he do this? Just the first time he enters play? Every time the first player token changes? At the beginning of each engagement phase?\n\n \n\nThe answer to that question would also answer the question of when do the Sam, Pippin, etc's abilities trigger.\n\n \n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124241-new-watcher-in-the-water-and-engagement/?do=findComment&comment=1289888","commentId":1289888,"userName":"wlk","timestamp":1412618368,"content":"Nice one...\n\nI'd say each time the engagement status changes, and that would be when the watcher enters play, then every time the token changes.\n\nI didn't notice since I played solo, so that was a moot point.\n\n \n\nI asked a ruling about Sam some time ago about the effect \"put [...] enemy into play engaged with the first player\" (check here: http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92528-sam-gamgee-and-the-prancing-pony/#entry895171 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/92528-sam-gamgee-and-the-prancing-pony/#entry895171])\n\n \n\n> Any time an enemy ends up in your play area, engaged with you, it has engaged you and you have engaged it. It doesn't matter if it comes from the staging area, the encounter deck, discard pile, or even out of play: if it ends up in your play area, it has engaged you. And if that enemy's engagement cost is higher than your threat, Sam's ability will trigger at that time.\n\n \n\nHowever, the answer was about \"entering the play area\", so this might not apply here.\n\nActually, the watcher never \"enters the play area\", he's only \"considered engaged\".\n\nBut the more I read this, the more I understand it as \"both applies\": he engages and he's also in the staging area (meaning that he could also be targeted by dunhere for example).\n\n \n\nThink this requires a ruling question to Caleb...\n\nEdited October 6, 2014 by wlk"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124241-new-watcher-in-the-water-and-engagement/?do=findComment&comment=1290369","commentId":1290369,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1412635529,"content":"I would say: it doesnt triggers nothing about engagement effect.\n\nIt is so because 'it is considered' but it doenst make the engagement action."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124241-new-watcher-in-the-water-and-engagement/?do=findComment&comment=1290484","commentId":1290484,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1412642995,"content":"Yeah it is only considered to be engaged with the first player but does not actually engage him per say and would not trigger that stage effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124241-new-watcher-in-the-water-and-engagement/?do=findComment&comment=1290711","commentId":1290711,"userName":"wlk","timestamp":1412662106,"content":"Sent question to Caleb... will post answer here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124241-new-watcher-in-the-water-and-engagement/?do=findComment&comment=1290782","commentId":1290782,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1412670820,"content":"Was already ask with Durin's Bane, and I think considered to be engaged does mean it never engages."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124241-new-watcher-in-the-water-and-engagement/?do=findComment&comment=1291169","commentId":1291169,"userName":"wlk","timestamp":1412697271,"content":"Indeed, Caleb confirmed, same as Durin's Bane:\n\n \n\n> In order for a player to engage an enemy (or an enemy to engage a player) it must enter your play area.
