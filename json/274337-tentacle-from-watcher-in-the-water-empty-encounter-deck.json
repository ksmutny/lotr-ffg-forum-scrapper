What if a character attacks/get attacked by a tentacle (their effects ask to discard a card from the encounter deck and trigger if the card is another tentacle or have shadow effect) and the deck is empty? Do I get a free pass, because its a combat phase (like with shadow cards)? \n\nEdited April 26, 2018 by DarkPhoenix"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/274337-tentacle-from-watcher-in-the-water-empty-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=3298420","commentId":3298420,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1524745484,"content":"You would get a free pass and the tentacle's ability would whiff."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/274337-tentacle-from-watcher-in-the-water-empty-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=3299739","commentId":3299739,"userName":"DarkPhoenix","timestamp":1524813041,"content":"Thats nice.
