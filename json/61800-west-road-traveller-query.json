The wording is specific to switching and you can't switch if there is no active location."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61800-west-road-traveller-query/?do=findComment&comment=605391","commentId":605391,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1331676521,"content":"Veybo said:\n\nWest Road Traveller states \"Response: After you play West Road Traveller from your hand, switch the active location with any other location in the staging area.\"\n\nSome of the Quest cards in \"The Massing at Osgiliath\" set state \"Players cannot travel to XXXX Bank locations.\"\n\n\n\nJust my opinion, I think that you can, as long as that particular location does not contain \"...cannot be affected by player card effect\" or something like that.  Since you are switching the active location, you are not Travelling, so you can avoid the Travel effects and work around the \"cannot travel\" effect."}]}
