I like to make an all around deck, but tend to get tired of playing it after three or four cycles (not of the moon or the earth) of playing the regular quests. I find changing up the focus of the deck e,g; which card i want to help shine, makes deckbuilding pretty fun. However, it is somewhat challenging because I share two core sets with my wife and she often takes all the support/main cards. Like Eowyn, Beravor, and Theodred. \n\n**** hero hog."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51630-deckbuilding-preference/?do=findComment&comment=516283","commentId":516283,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1313627556,"content":"Some good comments.  Along these lines, once the card population increases I would love to see FFG get creative with the quest scenarios to challenge deckbuilding and gameplay furhter...I could see a campaign set where the results of one scenario take you down different paths or cause you to start with a disadvantage or advantage in the subsequent scenarios.  Another interesting one would be parallel scenarios...build 2 decks with no common uniques (other than Gandalf of course.  He gets around).  Play the scenarios (most interesting if they are different scenarios), if they both win, you play against the 3rd scenario with both decks.  I think there are lots of concepts that can be built into the game to keep it fresh and unique."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51630-deckbuilding-preference/?do=findComment&comment=516557","commentId":516557,"userName":"avgzxc","timestamp":1313670915,"content":"I think it's a \"soft\" cheat when someone reads(or worse: memorises) the whole encounter deck.
