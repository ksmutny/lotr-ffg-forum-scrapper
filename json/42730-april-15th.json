But since you leave so close to the proverbial horses mouth might want to call them. They would have it for sure on the release date as they would want to release there at the same time as all of the other stores being able to officially release it. So you are lucky in that you are guaranteed to have it on time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42730-april-15th/?do=findComment&comment=453190","commentId":453190,"userName":"yohko2","timestamp":1302697299,"content":"If it's true, i'll get the game and all adventure packs, isolate myselft in a dark playing room with candles and LotR music and play cards until my hands grow sore."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/42730-april-15th/?do=findComment&comment=453342","commentId":453342,"userName":"DrNate","timestamp":1302714418,"content":"if you limit youself to 1-2 spheres per deck, that gives you a total of 112 different three hero combinations. multiply that by three different quests. Plus there is easy mode, hard mode And Nightmare mode. If you get tired of all of those, you can try a three sphere deck Or even a four sphere deck!
