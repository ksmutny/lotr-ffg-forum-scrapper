Cheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/35278-are-hands-of-cards-condusive-with-cooperation/?do=findComment&comment=357149","commentId":357149,"userName":"grouik2","timestamp":1284450429,"content":"Some of the enemy cards are unknown but others you know.

In too many cooperative games, I find that it generally breaks down into one person tells everyone else what to do, or the most experienced folks just order around the newbies. Play pandemic and see what I mean. While this doesnt happen every time, it happens enough. I think the hands allow for single player decisions within the framework of a multiplayer co-op game. Each player can construct their own deck, play resource cards from their own hand, and take their own turn. While the players must work together to win, this allows for each player to make their own decisions, free from the direction of the rest of the group. Once that player plays their cards for the round, the group can then work out who is exploring, attacking, defending, ect.\n\nWhen I teach this game to friends, we'll likely play with decks Ive made and with our hands showing so I can show them how it goes. After that, I'll turn them loose with my cards and let them make their own decks and play their own hands how they want to. if I want to play a game where I just direct the flow, I'll play solo with single or multiple decks. I think not being able to tell other players what to do makes the game more fun and challenging, as I am not simply telling them what to play and when, but letting their choices and deck work the way they want them to, and then combining it with my deck and choices, and then seeing how we do as a team."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/35278-are-hands-of-cards-condusive-with-cooperation/?do=findComment&comment=360953","commentId":360953,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1285054966,"content":"I see no reason why you can't have hidden hands. There aren't any mobile phones in middle earth so you can't constantly be in touch with everyone unless you all go around in a pack all the time. Also if you're in a fight with something you're hardly going to stop and say 'two ticks old chum, I just need to check that the other guys have the right cards for this fight. Thanks ever so much'. Hidden hands could represent the split second decision making needed for fights and the unexpected.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/35278-are-hands-of-cards-condusive-with-cooperation/?do=findComment&comment=360999","commentId":360999,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1285060963,"content":"spirit said:\n\nThere aren't any mobile phones in middle earth so you can't constantly be in touch with everyone unless you all go around in a pack all the time.\n\n\n\nSure there are, why do you think Celebrimbor (and Sauron) were so keen on making rings of power lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] .
