Maybe a next turn button that adds resources and threat and the turn counter automatically so you never forget and have to back track.\n\nI wouldn't be able to put any of Fantasy Flights fantastic art work in there but my brother is a pretty sweet fantasy artist.\n\nIf enough people like the idea I could crack one out in a week.\n\nThanks Dan."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220266-community-made-tlotr-companion-app/?do=findComment&comment=2223853","commentId":2223853,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1463603429,"content":"Would be very nice.
