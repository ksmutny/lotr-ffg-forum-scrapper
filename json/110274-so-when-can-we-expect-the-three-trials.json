This is essentially just telling us its available, everyone's already seen the cards. Lucky Three Trials should get spoiled tomorrow when it comes out!\n> > \n> >  \n> \n>  \n> \n> How do we know it's getting spoiled tomorrow?\n> \n>  \n\nOn the day that dunland trap was released someone from FFG posted all the cards in the dunland trap spoilers on cardgamedb (which FFG apparently bought recently). I'm hoping this is a new trend with the ring maker cycle where they spoil the cards once they are released to the public so that those of us who live far away (well... really just anywhere but the US....) and have to wait several extra weeks at least get to see the contents when everyone else does if we so wish.\n\nSuper super impressed by this and will be mega let down if it doesnt continue."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110274-so-when-can-we-expect-the-three-trials/?do=findComment&comment=1166322","commentId":1166322,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1406082862,"content":"http://boardgamegeek.com/article/16388962#16388962 [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/16388962#16388962]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110274-so-when-can-we-expect-the-three-trials/?do=findComment&comment=1169087","commentId":1169087,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1406253900,"content":"Nothing on cardgamedb just yet, it is however only the first day of release though.
