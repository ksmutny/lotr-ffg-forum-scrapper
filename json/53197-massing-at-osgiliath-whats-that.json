Some other quests important only 5 first round. after you already undestand you win only matter of time and scores.But this one no. Until the end you dont know what can happen. Scaling is very good. More players more interesting and hard.\n\nyou really feel yourself in the siege city full of enemies. Every stage is different and each stage more and more difficult. There is no time for relax more you progress more danger you meet. Last stage is hell. Witch-King is really Big Problem.  I try this quest many times  solo and everytime is something special.\n\nOther quest sometimes can be very monotony but not this one.  For me is good example how quest is should be done. Dol-guldor is also ok. But most of other quests is boring and easy for me. They are ok but to forseen sometimes. But not HFG, is also very tricky but  easy as well.\n\nRosghobel sound very promising. Cannot wait, maybe next week i get it.\n\ni hope Khazad-dum will be done the proff. level as Massing or Dol-Guldor.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53197-massing-at-osgiliath-whats-that/?do=findComment&comment=528648","commentId":528648,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1316104930,"content":"Svenn said:\n\nVyron said:\n\na viable option would be to have a \"scale\", e.g. as solo player, you \"only\" need idk 4 quest points, as opposed to 10 with 4 players... etc etc\n\n \n\nI like this idea, though technically it's supposed to scale via the 1 extra encounter card per player.

But FFG is getting better and better with scalability. Journey down the Anduin wasn't good (2B: 2 encounter cards is difficult for solo games, but it doesn't matter much if you are 4 players and have 5 encounter cards revealed), and Escape from Dol Guladur also (if you're playing solo, you have 3 bad objectives attached on only 3 heroes. With 4 players, 3 objectives but up to 12 heroes. And the impact on ressource generation because 1 hero being captured in a solo play, but still starting with the threat of all 3 heroes, that can be brutal.). But with HfG they started scaling (The Old Ford; only players with a clue can go questing in 3B); they increased this in the Carrock (number of those damned Sacked! cards depends on number of players); and I hope/think Rhosgobel scales really nice (Rhosgobels threat strength is player-dependent; the timing mechanism is also depending on the number of players: with 4 players, you'll draw Swarming Insects 4 times faster as when you're playing solo; in 2B the cost for looking at 3 encounter cards and choosing 1 is also proportional to the player number; and finally there's only 1 Wilyador helping you but he's \"shared\" between all players). I didn't have the chance to play Rhosgobel other than solo, but I think it'll scale brilliantly. I'm really looking forward to play this quest with my brother...\n\nLet's see if this development continues and FFG achieves the same difficulty level regardless of the number of players in future scenarios. They're on a good path."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53197-massing-at-osgiliath-whats-that/?do=findComment&comment=528808","commentId":528808,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1316134079,"content":"the larger the number of players, the harder it is to predict the encounter deck - in a quest like Carrock where you're wanting to quest slowly, that can be an issue - you commit enough willpower to the quest, get a few good (or perhaps in this situation bad) cards, and you've completed stage 1 in a single turn, with no time to amass resources and allies.\n\nI think the AP quests are doing a pretty good job of scaling - certainly better than Anduin or Dol Guldur - sure this means things will just keep on getting better.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53197-massing-at-osgiliath-whats-that/?do=findComment&comment=528814","commentId":528814,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1316136388,"content":"That what i call game balance.
