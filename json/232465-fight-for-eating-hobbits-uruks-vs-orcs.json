Pro: Orcs are numerous and easy to hunt. Con: They taste like terror and malevolence.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232465-fight-for-eating-hobbits-uruks-vs-orcs/?do=findComment&comment=2465964","commentId":2465964,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1476907854,"content":"They don't taste very nice, do they, precious?"}]}
