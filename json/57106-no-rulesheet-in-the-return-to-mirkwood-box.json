This player places the Gollum objective card in front of him to represent that he is guarding it. Various effects in the encounter and quest deck, as well as the effect on Gollum itself, interact with the player who is guarding Gollum.\" \n\n\"Once a player is guarding Gollum, that player cannot relinquish the responsibility to another player unless card text allows, or in some cases, mandates a change. The text on the Gollum objective itself allows the players to choose a new guard at the end of each game round.\"\n\n\"The Gollum objective has hit points, and it is possible that he will be destroyed during the quest. If Gollum is destroyed, or leaves play for any reason, the players have lost the game. Gollum cannot be used to attack, defend, or commit to a quest. Otherwise, Gollum is considered an ally character under the control of the player guarding him. Card effects that affect allies do affect him, and any attachment that can be played on an ally can be played on Gollum.\"\n \n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57106-no-rulesheet-in-the-return-to-mirkwood-box/?do=findComment&comment=563840","commentId":563840,"userName":"Lobosolo1","timestamp":1323039289,"content":"Thanks Titan!  Now we can try out the scenario."}]}
