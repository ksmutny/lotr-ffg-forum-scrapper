I really like how Elrond or Vilya turned out, with a minor exception. I see it was easier to do this way but thematically it seems off the Ring can only be attached to Elrond, given the history of the previous bearer Gil-Galad. I think a Noldor or Istari hero would do well; but on the other hand I understand Elrond's power, and it could have been hard to word it otherwise, not least due to the lack of space for the card text."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67956-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=662834","commentId":662834,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1343112771,"content":"I think making the ring only work with Elrond was a good call based on mechanics.  The ring is a powerhouse, and if you want to use it you need to roll with the most 'expensive' hero in the game.  Your high starting threat makes it more difficult to use the ring's power.  Can you imagine what it would be like if you could put the ring on the new Glorfindel?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67956-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=662843","commentId":662843,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1343114811,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nI think making the ring only work with Elrond was a good call based on mechanics.  The ring is a powerhouse, and if you want to use it you need to roll with the most 'expensive' hero in the game.  Your high starting threat makes it more difficult to use the ring's power.  Can you imagine what it would be like if you could put the ring on the new Glorfindel?\n\n\n\nI also think is ok for now.

I was thinking it could be a Noldor hero but not that every Noldor hero would have the same power. I totally see though how hard it would be to word all of that.

There is an incredible potential in Tolkien's work, and in fantasy. Just look how \"easy\" it was to create massive audience with the garbage of the likes of Eragon or GoT. I am not to make the lovers angry, I just want to show the potential of such work. And Tolkien is already so popular that there will be huge audience once anything Tolkien-based is announced. And the fact that it is from a different time will only create a new one. I myself am very skeptical that Silmarillon-based film will ever happen (due to movie rights mostly) but I can imagine the outrage among the fans if it shall, and the crazed masses pouring into cinema; it would be full of great battles, beautiful sceneries, epic stories, hot actors and actresses, it doesn't get more attractive than that in current culture.\n\nThe adaption can still pose a certain problem but there are \"major\" stories to pick upon, the Trees and the Silmarills, the Exodus of Noldor, Beren and Lúthien, Children of Húrin, Fall of Gondolin, War of Wrath, etc."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67956-vilya/?do=findComment&comment=664563","commentId":664563,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1343382629,"content":"mmmm, im not sure what to think about a silmarillion film, mind you i still dont like the idea of a hobbit film (but thats a whole other thread)….though for different reasons. i think that there is more complex lore for the producers to crap on and turn into a hollywood story, and if i thought the trilogy pulled some bad decisions then the silmarillion would be much worse as if they pulled the storys from the books straight to film, or even followed them closely, then most film viewers would be baffled. hell how many of us had to read the silmarillion 2/3 times until we properly got it?\n\nit still would have all the wonderful scenes as lleimmoen said, but i think the task would be great to adapt it to a film, far more than the trilogy or the hobbit\n\n "}]}
