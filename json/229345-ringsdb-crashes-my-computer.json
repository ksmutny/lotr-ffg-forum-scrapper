It works on my laptop, phone and ipad, but any time I try with the desktop it crashes the computer. I've never seen a webpage do this before. Anyone have a similar idea or have any idea how I can fix it?\n\n \n\nHrmm interesting, I downloaded Firefox and it works there, but no in my Google browser, so weird.\n\nEdited September 5, 2016 by FrogTrigger"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229345-ringsdb-crashes-my-computer/?do=findComment&comment=2400163","commentId":2400163,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1473083206,"content":"It doesn't crash my computer, but it does crash my Chrome brower tab.
