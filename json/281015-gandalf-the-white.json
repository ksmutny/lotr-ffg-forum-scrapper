He's the one single hero i've wanted the most since opening the core set and i'm still hyped for him if he ever comes out. And the longer i have to wait, the more anxious i am that the game will be over before they can make him. Do you think one hero Gandalf is enough or does white variant deserve his own card? \n\nTo make for some more discussion, this is my fan version i've designed: \n\n \n\n \n\nGandalf-Przód.jpg [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_08/371661282_Gandalf-Przd.jpg.a05d24120104b87f41146ffe6d7f98dd.jpg] [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_08/371661282_Gandalf-Przd.jpg.a05d24120104b87f41146ffe6d7f98dd.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281015-gandalf-the-white/?do=findComment&comment=3440940","commentId":3440940,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1534285026,"content":"Wow, I love his ability!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281015-gandalf-the-white/?do=findComment&comment=3441034","commentId":3441034,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1534291726,"content":"He was actually discuessed helluva lot on these forums prior to the saga box release which contained that boon which represents him becoming the white (Beyond All Hope or something, don't quite remember the name).

First, I think that the current hero Gandalf we already have is supposed to represent Gandalf in general, both grey and white (the reason he appears grey in the artwork is because I think the most iconic representation of him is as the grey, plus he lived most of his life as that and only the last few years as the white, plus even when he was the white he would wear the grey cloak over the white garments). His ability, moreover, I think is a perfect representation of Gandalf, again, in general. Second, if they were to make a new version specifically representing Gandalf the White, he would still be named Gandalf to avoid uniqueness trouble. So, in the end, you would end up with just another version of Gandalf much like we previously had Leadership Aragorn and then Lore Aragorn. Personally, I would much prefer if the designers made hero versions of Radagast, Saruman and (if license permits, which I think it should now), Alatar and Pallando before a new version of Gandalf, which is already really good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281015-gandalf-the-white/?do=findComment&comment=3441204","commentId":3441204,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1534310803,"content":"Alatar and Pallando would have an ability like : \"After they quest remove them from game\" or something ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281015-gandalf-the-white/?do=findComment&comment=3441280","commentId":3441280,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1534322464,"content":"I would agree with others that the current Gandalf is not designated as grey or white, there is the boon, and 2 allies.

But I could he wrong \n\nI would be surprised if another Gandalf hero came out as well -- and I think the version here is under-costed -- he either gets free readying or +2 willpower, and may get +1 willpower with free readying.  I don't think we will ever see the same (non-saga) hero in the same sphere as another version of the same hero, and I can't see Gandalf with a sphere.\n\nI don't think the same logic applies to Bilbo and Frodo, while there are \"four versions\" of Bilbo, two are essentially objective heroes tied to a handful of quests, leaving us only a single ally and a single (overcosted) hero.  There's plenty of room for another version of such an iconic character.  Frodo is even worse in this regard, since four of his five versions are restricted to saga quests, leaving one of the central characters of the story with only a single playable version; and not one that works well with other Hobbits at that.  We badly need need new versions of both."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281015-gandalf-the-white/?do=findComment&comment=3441396","commentId":3441396,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1534336033,"content":"I'm surprised that no one say it before but a Gandalf the white hero does not perfectly fit in the timeline of our game.

In fact his ability work well with the pipe ability, both spirit and hobbit mechanic, since it give us a good way to spend the threat we win in order to draw cards.
