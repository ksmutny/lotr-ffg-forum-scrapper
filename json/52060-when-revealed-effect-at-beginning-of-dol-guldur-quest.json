When I draw a card to attach to a Objective card, and I draw in this example King Spider lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php [http://lotrlcg.com/cardFocus.php?Title=King%20Spider], does it make its effect or doesn't?\n\nIn the quest card 1A, it doesn't mentioned the word \"revealed\" and neither a form of it. The quest card says:\n\nSetup: Search the encounter deck for the 3 objective cards, and place them in the staging area. Also, place the Nazgul of Dol Guldur face up but out of play, alongside the quest deck. Then, shuffle the encounter deck, and attach 1 encounter to each objective card.\n\nIn the FAQ says:\n\n(1.19) Card Effects during Setup\n\"When Revealed\" effects are resolved if the cards are\nrevealed during setup. A player can trigger responses\nduring setup, following the normal game rules. Players\ncannot take Actions during setup.\n\n(1.22) \"When Revealed\" Effects\nA card is only considered to be revealed if the card or\ngame effect causing the card to enter play specifically\nuses a form of the word \"reveal\".\n\nI think this example is equal than the example mentioned in the point 1.22 of the FAQ. This situation may be a example of The Golden Rule, the cards take precedence over the rules.\n\nI think too the same situation resolves equal if the card has Doomed and/or Surge. It's not been revealed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52060-when-revealed-effect-at-beginning-of-dol-guldur-quest/?do=findComment&comment=519187","commentId":519187,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1314166366,"content":"I find it crystal clear that \"when revealed\" are not resolved here. There are many that disagree. There is one argument about objectives but I find that totally out of place as it, in my opinion, refers to objectives that enter the game from the encounter deck - like in Hunt for Gollum.
