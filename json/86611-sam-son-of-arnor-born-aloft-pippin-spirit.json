Even if the first sentence fizzels the second will not. This is a pumpable effect. Maybe less threat problem would be to use something like this...\n\n \n\n \n\n> ive just realised how epic fast hitch would be on sam once this combo gets going. 6 willpower, 4 attack, 4 defense and 3 ready abilities....he would be like a 1 hobbit army!\n\n \n\nyeah.. also remember they never broke to infinite loop took combo... so threat mean nothing any more anyway. I do not run this combo, but you can reduce you threat with impunity if you really want to.\n\nEdited July 19, 2013 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86611-sam-son-of-arnor-born-aloft-pippin-spirit/?do=findComment&comment=818558","commentId":818558,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1374429866,"content":"And how about the amazingly simple yet powerful Sam + The Hammer Stroke combo!

Pair Sam with Merry and maybe Boromir(tactics)/Beregond...use Beregond/Boromir with behind strong walls (or Boromir's ability) to defend the enemies, attack with Sam and Merry, Merry readies Sam to attack again. Or include Cram to ready Merry to start their chain over. If using Boromir pay the threat to use his attack too. Could be a 3 person wrecking crew"}]}
