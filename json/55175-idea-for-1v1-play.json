If I want a player v player game I'll just play MTG or Shadowfist or any number of other games like that. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55175-idea-for-1v1-play/?do=findComment&comment=547531","commentId":547531,"userName":"reno1051","timestamp":1319622398,"content":"i have a pvp variant worked out...just needs some play testing and refining.  its been in the works for at least 2 months but i have been very busy with work so i didnt have time to progress and finalize it yet."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55175-idea-for-1v1-play/?do=findComment&comment=547591","commentId":547591,"userName":"Hannibal_pjv","timestamp":1319632954,"content":"Freep card discard will put those encounter decks out of sync. For example \"Discard target revealed xxxx-card\".\n\nBut an possible solution. Even better would be preorganised decks, where deck sync is not so relevant.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55175-idea-for-1v1-play/?do=findComment&comment=547712","commentId":547712,"userName":"gobliin","timestamp":1319651261,"content":"I think that it could be a interesting idea. It would keep the basic mechanic of the game and it would allowed some competitive environnement which could be good for organise play."}]}
