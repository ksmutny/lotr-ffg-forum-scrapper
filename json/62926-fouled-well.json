It's easy to infer that the reference to choice is a superfluous error; it strains credulity to say the insistence on a discard \"at random\" was an unintended part of the card. \n\nIn order to discard a card \"at random,\" you have to physically \"pick\" a card. That's all it means. You use a method of random selection to choose which card is discarded. Yes, it would be simpler if it were worded the same way as Necromancer's Pass, but the randomness is the most important part of the text. Each player must randomly discard 1 card, or Fouled Well gains surge. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62926-fouled-well/?do=findComment&comment=616070","commentId":616070,"userName":"guest479094","timestamp":1334101532,"content":" Oh I am not in any way trying to negate the random aspect. I am exploring whether or not the choose and discard are somewhat distinct. IOW, choose a card at random, then decide whether or not to discard this card. My reasoning stems from the fact that all other usages of \"choose and discard\" involve knowing what card is being discarded before the decision to discard is made AND the fact that the only other effect I can find which involves a random discard (or blind discard from either deck for that matter) says simply to discard. \n\nEven if such reasoning wrong (and I strongly suspect it is) there seems to be some discrepancy or inconsistency present.
