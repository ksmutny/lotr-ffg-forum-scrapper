So, if you always do that, it's not that hard (if it weren't for some nasty encounter card effects). In my solo games I had success by using decks with a low startig threat (for example, Hobbits)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104470-voice-of-isengard-the-command-time/?do=findComment&comment=1057525","commentId":1057525,"userName":"player723290","timestamp":1398154339,"content":"Here is the point!\n\nThe italian translation is wrong!\n\nIt si written to' place a progress token, not a time counter....!!\n\nOk, guys thanks for everything...\n\nLet's try a new adventure...!"}]}
