I think these are great ideas for player cards, especially since they'll be limited to 3-per-deck. That will decrease the power they have, but still make them really useful. I imagine most decks running Gimili would include Cleave."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63164-cleave-and-multi-shot-house-rule/?do=findComment&comment=619428","commentId":619428,"userName":"Cotillion37","timestamp":1334775311,"content":"Those do sound like some pretty sweet ideas for future cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63164-cleave-and-multi-shot-house-rule/?do=findComment&comment=634753","commentId":634753,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1337721244,"content":"You Cleave idea sounds pretty much like my \"Inner FIre\" custom made Event: http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/769703/cordeirooos-custom-made-lotr-stuff [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/769703/cordeirooos-custom-made-lotr-stuff]"}]}
