you need to think what player cards you want most too......the first cycle of 6 packs has alot of EAGLES and ROHAN characters so if you like them then you can pretty much go for any pack.....the new dwarrodelf cycle will see obviously DWARVES so if you are a dwarf fan maybe hold out and buy khazad dum (the deluxe expansion) and wait for the releases....again this will mean multiple orders. maybe decide on the difficulty you want also....if you want a challenge i would say HUNT FOR GOLLUM or if you want a pack that is really hard then the last one RETURN TO MIRKWOOD- though i wouldnt recommend this one without you having a bit of experience first. if you like locations and theme then go for  EMYN MUIL or DEAD MARSHES....or if you like fighting the CONFLICT AT THE CARROCK is a good one.....if you like a game with an interesting 'race against the clock' then go for JOURNEY TO RHOSGOBEL\n\n3. i would say it takes a while to get your head round the rules...ESPECIALLY THE VAGUE ONES....have a copy of the recent FAQ ready at hand and a link to this forum ready...you will ask alot of questions even if you are an experience player of other similar games.....after you get the phases in your head things run pretty smoothly from there. the worst thing i think is timing....what you are allowed to play when, i would reccomend downloading the rule book which is available here on the site, and browse through it and the action chart at the end\n\nps. im not trying to put you off here.....im obsessesed with this game, but i do like to be fair when i say the rulebook isnt that great, that said once youve been playing for a while i think you could comfortably teach this game...i know i could teach this if i had the time\n\n \n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58863-help-future-players/?do=findComment&comment=578607","commentId":578607,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1326383626,"content":"Listen to Rich! ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] Welcome to the game you guys, and happy gaming! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58863-help-future-players/?do=findComment&comment=578612","commentId":578612,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1326383932,"content":" The only thing you'd need an additional core set for is extra threat counters, and possibly having extra copies of the cards that only come in 1 or 2 copies in a single core set.  It it totally feasible to play 4 player with one core set, though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58863-help-future-players/?do=findComment&comment=578620","commentId":578620,"userName":"AngeloGargamel","timestamp":1326385061,"content":"Thanks for the quick reply!!\n\n \n\nI've read the rulebook and take a look in some cards... i'm really excited to begin playing the game!\n\nI'm thinking, based on rich's answer', i'll buy core, thehunt for gollum and the sequel (forgot the name...), even if we'll just play the core at the beginning!happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\nWe want to play some hard adventures (like the difficult in gears of war 4 players)\n\n \n\nThanks again!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58863-help-future-players/?do=findComment&comment=578625","commentId":578625,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1326385319,"content":"AngeloGargamel said:\n\n \n\nThanks for the quick reply!!\n\n \n\nI've read the rulebook and take a look in some cards... i'm really excited to begin playing the game!\n\nI'm thinking, based on rich's answer', i'll buy core, thehunt for gollum and the sequel (forgot the name...), even if we'll just play the core at the beginning!happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\nWe want to play some hard adventures (like the difficult in gears of war 4 players)\n\n \n\nThanks again!\n\n \n\n \n\nwell i can probably say with ease that you will find the game a challenge at the start, i think everyone does....so if thats what you want you're in for a treat\n\ngreat things await those who buy this game.........be warned though....the One Ring's power is strong....you may get hooked gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58863-help-future-players/?do=findComment&comment=578632","commentId":578632,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326385827,"content":"hmmm.... buying for a gaming group can be tricky, as you can easily over buy... but imo a single player needs 2 copies of core + all expansions at a minimum to really get into this game... 3 copies of core if you are serious about making ubr decks.

If you're regularly playing with 3 or 4 players, then you won't have any extra cards lying around. Each small expansion will only add 6 cards to your deck - assuming you've got 4 1-sphere decks.\n\nThat's not a problem, you can still play the game, it just gives things a different feel. Personally, for a lot of multi-player, I think a 2nd core set is worthwhile. 3rd core set, definitely just for hard-core players.\n\nThat's not to sat you can't have fun with a single core set, you just won't really be able to deck-build for quite a long time, and you'll probably struggle with some of the later expansion quests (starter decks could easily get milled out by Return to Mirkwood)\n\nUltimately tho, if it's just your group of 3 or 4, you can do what you like. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58863-help-future-players/?do=findComment&comment=578856","commentId":578856,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1326436366,"content":"I would second Rich's comment about keeping this forum handy.
