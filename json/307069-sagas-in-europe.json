I want to buy into the saga series but can't find the first one (the black riders) anywhere in Europe. Can I expect a reprint soon or do I have to buy an other expansion? If so what expansion can you guys recommend."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307069-sagas-in-europe/?do=findComment&comment=3920849","commentId":3920849,"userName":"Sasajak","timestamp":1585387037,"content":"Welcome to the game. Â Unfortunately youâ€™ve discovered itâ€™s most frustrating aspect - getting the exact expansions you want when you want them if youâ€™re outside of the US! Â But donâ€™t be disheartened; the expansions are well worth it.Â  You can either be patient and check checking your stores or buy from the US and pay a bit moreÂ (I used Amazon.com when I lostÂ patience ðŸ˜‚). Â At the moment though Amazon.com isnâ€™t shipping some non-essential items.Â eBay is a waste of time, unless you want to pay a lot more thanÂ normal prices. Â Hope that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307069-sagas-in-europe/?do=findComment&comment=3920852","commentId":3920852,"userName":"Preotet","timestamp":1585387972,"content":"Maybe this will help.\n\nÂ \n\nhttps://boardgameprices.co.uk/item/show/4278/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-the-black-riders [https://boardgameprices.co.uk/item/show/4278/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-the-black-riders]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307069-sagas-in-europe/?do=findComment&comment=3921206","commentId":3921206,"userName":"Starnoxiar","timestamp":1585466424,"content":"Thanks!"}]}
