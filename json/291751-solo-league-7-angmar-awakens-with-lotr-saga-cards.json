This month we'll be playing three quests from Lost Realm and the Angmar Awakens cycle. The quests are:\n\n1) Weather Hills (Deluxe)\n2) Escape from Mount Gram (AP2)\n3) Battle of Carn Dum (AP5)\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.\n\n2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests -- this means you must have at least one of Tactics Aragorn, Halbarad, Rossiel, and Amarthiul.\n\n3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:\n\nFor each token you have, after you draw/mulligan your initial hand you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource.\n\nThe original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:\n\nRule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.\nRule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.\n\nSo for example, if I start with six tokens against Carn Dum and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)\n\nRemember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing Escape from Mount Gram it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Weather Hills.\n\n4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker). You are required to reveal which Heroes you used, and how many cards in your deck came from outside LR/Angmar cycle, LOTR saga and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.\n\n5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered, though we haven't had a zero-token winner in the last three months. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:\n---\n1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from LOTR saga, LR/Angmar or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.\n\n2nd) The number of heroes specifically from LOTR saga and LR/Angmar. More is better.\n\n3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: TaAragorn, Halbarad, Rossiel, Amarthiul. More is better.\n\n4th) The number of cards in the deck outside LOTR saga and LR/Angmar. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n5th) The number of cards outside Lost Realm, Escape from Mount Gram, and Battle of Carn Dum. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n6th) Performance in February's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish February's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.\n---\n\n6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for May's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in April's league. April's league will be in LOTR saga, quests still to be determined.\n\n7) Weekly deadlines will be on Monday at 11pm Eastern. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.\n\nWeather Hills: March 11th\nEscape from Mount Gram: March 18th\nBattle of Carn Dum: March 25th\n\n8 ) I've created a google spreadsheet for results here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yK0oi1aAeiMmtXUNBhIeJ8zGqkAHib5iyGtWWACW0LM/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yK0oi1aAeiMmtXUNBhIeJ8zGqkAHib5iyGtWWACW0LM/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nTo join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.\n\nIf you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results (I hope to do this), but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself.\n\nEdited March 4, 2019 by dalestephenson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291751-solo-league-7-angmar-awakens-with-lotr-saga-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3638885","commentId":3638885,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1551678890,"content":"I have been so busy lately, but I hope I can find the time to do this month's league!

I was not finding the motivation to make a deck to play these quest. Then I remembered I have no Dunedain deck!\n\n \n\nI used my new Outmatched Duendain deck [http://www.ringsdb.com/deck/view/147293], heavily based on Gizlivadi's Dunedain deck [http://www.ringsdb.com/decklist/view/2972/all-that-is-gold-does-not-glitter-1.0]. I have to say that playing Mount Gram has been a blast. I took Halbarad as my hero and I was very lucky by having in my starting hand a song of wisdom and Steward of Gondor. Also, from the Prision Cell I freed a Ranger of Cardolan, so I was for sure lucky. Nevertheless, I have to say that his ability to quest for free when you are engaged with an enemy made all the difference.\n\n \n\nFor battle of Carn Dum I don't know what to say. It was not all that heavy, but then I think it is a quest that depends a lot on what the encounter deck throws at you, but on this quest Outmatched won the day for me, well that and Ancestral Armour, Burning brand, Armored Destreir... 😛\n\n \n\nI am happy, I was about not to participate because I was lazy, and at the end of the day I had tons of fun and I ended up with a new deck in my library!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291751-solo-league-7-angmar-awakens-with-lotr-saga-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3658956","commentId":3658956,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1553691617,"content":"Carn Dum has a terrible reputation.  A deserved reputation, if you have no protection against shadow cards.  After finishing my first run, I tried running through these three quests with my Stereotypical Dunedain Deck.  I started with 12 tokens, then went to 18, then went to 24, then went to 30--I'll admit I didn't play all those out, I just scooped in disgust after losing Amarthiul to a shadow in the first few turns.  Fully healthy, six defense -- boom, dead.  Finally managed to overwhelm it with 36 tokens and chump blocking with 3-cost Dunedain, and didn't feel like playing it again to see if I could lower my count.\n\nBut in the real entrants, all of which have Lore or Balin, here's how we did (outside cards in parens):\n\n0 Yepesnopes (27)\n0 Thanee (42)\n2 Vermithrax (23)\n4 Skihorse4848 (41)\n6 Gillies2921 (44)\n8 dalestephenson (31)\n\nOK, I'm last with my official deck as well.  But I'm first in the non-Aragorn division.  For some reason, nobody else wanted to take down Carn Dum with Rossiel.\n\nHere's the final standings:\n\n0 Yepesnopes (27)\n0 Thanee (42)\n3 Vermithrax (23)\n6 Gillies2921 (44)\n11 dalestephenson (31)\n14 Skihorse4848 (41)\n\nCongratulations to Yepesnopes, second lowest in outside cards but taking no tokens against the three quests.  If memory serves, this is the first time he's used regular quests instead of nightmare, and it paid off in the standings.  Yepesnopes gets to choose the cycle for May's league, Thanee gets to pick a quest from it to play, and Vermithrax gets to pick a quest not to play.  SkiHorse4848, courtesy of bad luck on Weather Hills, gets to choose a supplemental cycle for player cards.  Thanks to all of you for playing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/291751-solo-league-7-angmar-awakens-with-lotr-saga-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3659224","commentId":3659224,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1553704051,"content":"Hi!\n\nI already choosed cycle once.
