The FAQ has updated rules that are considerably more difficult; essentially, wounds and threat don't reset between quests, but all cards in hand and in play get shuffled back into the player deck. All cards discarded or removed from the game stay in those zones. Quite a bit more challenging, if that's what you're looking for."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62296-heroic-core-quests/?do=findComment&comment=609882","commentId":609882,"userName":"Eric W","timestamp":1332662347,"content":"We played that wounds, resources and card hands stayed the same.  Basically, once a quest was reset you stood all your characters and started the next quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62296-heroic-core-quests/?do=findComment&comment=610007","commentId":610007,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1332691752,"content":"That actually makes it quite easy, since you're already built up ally and attachment wise.
