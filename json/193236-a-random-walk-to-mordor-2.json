The Weather Hills              Gandalf         Erestor         Bifur           Thalin          Faramir (Le)    Merry (Sp)\n\n \n\nBad luck tonight. Built two decks to give this a shot, one Erestor Bifur Merry, the other Gandalf Thalin Faramir.\n\n \n\nThe lore deck has a lot of ents and healing to try and weather the damage the encounter deck puts out + Steed of Imladris to power through active locations. The other deck is a bit of a mixed Gandalf bag that could use some tuning. But Blades of Gondolin are good in a scenario with about one enemy per round where they're all Orcs.\n\n \n\nFirst attempt: No healing in the first couple of rounds, and I got buried under the treacheries. Lost Thalin and Merry pretty quick, as the least useful of the heroes, and then couldn't pull out of it from there.\n\n \n\nSecond attempt: A weather treachery surges into all three sidequests, and I got buried under threat before the last one could be cleared. Healing > Hero damage > Threat was my priority order, and I think that's right, but man does the staging area fill up fast when you're actually questing for progress tokens.\n\n \n\nI like my healing strategy, but I'm a bit surprised it hasn't been more consistent. Lembas, Self Preservation, and the Warden of Healing are all good when the character-blanking treachery is in play. And Bifur + Erestor on the same team make it easy to pay for any of them and have cards left over for standard discard effects. Steed of Imladris is also fantastic in such a location heavy quest. I think I need to add more card draw and some threat reduction."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193236-a-random-walk-to-mordor-2/?do=findComment&comment=1894388","commentId":1894388,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1447608782,"content":"Over the Misty Mountains Grim (option 64 from the extra list)\n\n(Careful! Wall of text incoming J)\n\n \n\nDeck 1 = Aragorn, Bombur, Eomer (Starting Player) Deck 2 = Prince Imrahil, Fatty Bolger, Dunhere\n\nNote: I don’t use any treasures you could have if you get them in “We must away, ere break of day”\n\n \n\nAt first I tried to combine Aragorn with Fatty to make use of his ability, but this ultimately didn’t work out, mainly, I think, because I split up my two lore heroes resulting in me having not enough resources to pay for my healers, as the boulders were giving me a very hard time keeping my party alive and power questing was very hard as 4 of my heroes have 1 or less willpower.\n\n \n\nSo I switched it up to the line-up you can see at the top, netting me 2 duo sphere decks, what made bringing my precious healers into play much easier. With the “new” Decks I ended up having Bombur and Fatty in 2 different Decks, who are pretty much the 2 weakest heroes in the game and putting both in the same deck prohibits nearly any useful move with the deck.\n\n \n\nMy strategy with the “new “decks then was, to make use of Bombur’s high health pool and respectable 2 defence. Eomer should do the fighting (especially in stage 3) and Aragorn was my flex hero doing whatever seemed necessary in the current game state. The other deck was made for questing. Yep that’s pretty much it. I threw in nearly all of the 1 to 2 cost spirit allies, who have 2 willpower, so if the draw and starting hand would have a high chance at boosting my questpower by a least 2 per round. This was important for my strategy, as I decided, that with only 1 tactics hero it was kind of pointless to try to kill the stone-giants in stage 2 when 1 can advance with having one or more in play. Obviously I was going to face the 4 threat of the giant and its surge effect for the boulders. What may seem like a pretty straight forward strategy gets spiced up by the fact, that there are treacheries in this quest, which make the giants engage the play with the highest threat (what destroys an ally, because of the forced effect of the giant), destroy all attachments in play, remove all Baggins resources (what will make the step from stage 2 to 3 very ugly) and either reveal 2 additional encounter cards or raise your threat by 4. Also **** these boulders, which deal 3 damage and remove the character from the quest.\n\n \n\nBesides the questpowers of deck 2, I threw in a lot of dunedain buffs (attack and defence) and the pretty common steward, Gandalf + Sneak Attack and Errand Rider to smooth out my resources.\n\nNow to the winning attempt (I lost 3 games with my original set-up and then 1 with the new one). I got good starting hands with Arwen and a Dunedain defence buff for deck 2, what would make Bombur pretty good at taking hits from stone giants, should that happen (4 defence + 5 HP) while also getting the 2 willpower turn 1. Deck 1 has a Daughter of Nimrodel and 2 lore and 1 tactics outlander.\n\nQuest-setup first puts one stone-giant in the staging area then reveals one card per player: Boulders (does nothing but surge), heavy rain (but there are no attachments), boulders again (surge), no campfire (doomed 1; both decks reveal another card as there wasn’t anything bad till now), Cave Entrance, Guffawing of Giants (meaning the set up giant will attack after questing!). I was quite happy with this setup as 1 copy of heavy rain passed by and 2 copies of boulders (plus I have all the tools to handle the giant).\n\n \n\nDeck 1 does nothing (as I only play attachments when necessary as there might be another rain and the giant will kill any ally I play), while deck 2 brings out Arwen and the defence boost for Bombur. I send everyone on the quest (except Bombur) and reveal a second giant and another Guffawing of Giants (not sure on the order anymore; I choose the same giant to engage as I already did in the setup. I’m not totally sure this is a legal move as this feels pretty cheap but nothing on the card says I can’t choose the same giant twice). Not really advancing on the quest I’m still fine: I can handle the giant and have no problem travelling to the cave entrance to avoid his ugly effect.\n\n \n\nOver the next turns I make slow progress (around 4 each turn) while dodging the second heavy rain (in form of a shadow card) but getting hit by More like a Grocer (it’s worth mentioning I have Bofur dropping in and out of play triggering Eomer and Imrahil every turn) . That way I only had 2 Baggins resources when advancing from stage 2 to 3, but I have a real army of allies out, my heroes a pretty healthy (thanks to 2 daughters since turn 3).\n\nAfter shuffling all encounter cards back into the encounter deck (stage 3A tells you to do so) I have to reveal 4 encounter cards from the new encounter deck (after paying 2 Baggins resources): 3 Goblins are added to the GG (Great Goblin), who was already added to the staging area from stage 3A, and Chaos in the caverns (what would return all goblins to the staging area and then give all of them +1 threat but as I just advanced to this stage that doesn’t matter). Both Decks engage 2 enemies (deck 1 grabbing the GG). This is pretty much the last important moment for the rest of the game, because the staging area is empty quest progress will be easily achieved, so it’s just about surviving this round and getting rid of the great goblin as soon as possible, as his forced effect could drown me in enemies and I can’t win with him in play. I did the math before questing this round to make sure I would have the 10 damage needed to one-hit the GG but had hoped to get less enemies, as I am unwilling to give up my chance at killing the GG, deck 2 takes a weaker goblin undefended and deck 1 uses Orc-Cleaver to kill an other(I have 1 Hasty stroke in case of an emergency, but with 4 attacks it is still risky especially as there are shadow effects that will cause additional attacks, what is extremely bad if this ends up on the great goblin), after I defended the GG to check is shadow card first, which had no effect, and reveal one goblin by the forced effect and it to the staging area. My whole board takes a big load of damage, but everything survives AND I can clear the GG (adding it to the victory display). Two turns later I quest through for the WIN.\n\nScore: 81/151 (lower number is without counting rounds)\n\n \n\nFinal thoughts: After struggling in my first attempts I really realised how annoying the first stage can be. With Crows, Boulders and No Campfire there are sooo many cards that can surge, resulting in the encounter deck really digging for this ugly heavy rain or more like a grocer. I think I really went lucky with the setup effectively burning two boulders and one rain. Sadly neither Bombur (who really was the game winner with the help of the dunedain buff, Arwen and the daughter heal) nor Fatty Bolger could convince me to give them a second try in any other deck, because in my winning attempt Bolger would never use his ability and there are better heroes do defend (even in the lore sphere e.g. Denethor or Elrond as they have other useful abilities when no defending is needed). In the end it was a fun challenge, even though it was a little frustrating after the first three losses, which weren’t really close (that is the reason I didn’t make a complete session report as I lost my motivation to write down every detail)\n\n \n\n“Fun Facts”\n-No Giants were harmed during this paythrough.\n\n-No Tests of Will were possible in all 5 attempts!\n\n-Orc-Cleaver was a really great help getting rid of 2 orcs\n\n-Bombur got my only copy of unexpected courage (never thought this would ever happen :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])\n\n-Fatty Bolger was the best defender of a deck (with a ring mail)\n\n -Bofur combined with Imrahil and Eomer is really great :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n-I like Deep Knowledge much more than I thought I would\n\n \n\nI didn’t write down the deck lists, but if someone is interested I could do it J\n\n\n\nEdited November 15, 2015 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193236-a-random-walk-to-mordor-2/?do=findComment&comment=1894543","commentId":1894543,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1447619871,"content":"Nice write up Calvadur - sorry it caused you so much frustration!

The healing is nice, but these heroes have too little attack power to take out nightmare enemies.\n\n \n\nNext up I tried it on normal mode.  Thankfully I got an early Warden of Healing to keep everyone healthy and an Honour Guard to keep the Warden alive and keep damage off of Wilyador.  Questing was a little slow, but I was able to play Healing Herbs, two Lore of Imladris, and I found 2 Athelas in the encounter deck.  Bifur got caught in two webs so he just read a book the whole time.  I was never in any real peril, but that quest has some very nasty treacheries I had forgotten about, and I had no spirit heroes for Tests of Will.  Final score was 111 and I had 8 extra healing to spare for Wilyador.\n\nEdited November 26, 2015 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193236-a-random-walk-to-mordor-2/?do=findComment&comment=1908434","commentId":1908434,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1448544005,"content":"> I also went with 3 Honour Guards, because they can prevent the damage to Wilyador without getting discarded.\n\n \n\nNice, I wouldn't have thought of this!\n\n \n\nThe Eagle Hunter in Nightmare mode is hard to deal with, and like you said you can't just ignore him because of the damage he's putting on Wilyador.

This perticular hero team was actually pretty stellar, so I opted for half-baked decks just to try some things and it still worked out in the end (I really should have included healing, more card draw and threat reduction). Ingold deserves some loving in a good Gondor-resources deck. 2/3 willpower for 3 is pretty boss in leadership until you get your mass willpower bonuses going.
