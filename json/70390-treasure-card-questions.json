I assume they are shuffled into the encounter deck at the start of the scenario, and when you reveal them from the deck they are 'discovered'. Does that mean you can immediately attach them to an eligible bearer? Or do you set them aside and can only use them on the next quest? Do you have to beat the quest in which you discover them to use them?
