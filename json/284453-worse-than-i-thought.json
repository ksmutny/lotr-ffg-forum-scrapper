Don't know how development works on these things, but I would assume there should be more people on board. \n\nEDIT: Also, I feel like the Arkham LCG craze will tone down way faster than LOTR LCG did. FFG has overdone it with the Lovecraft theme. There are literally so many games from them with that theme and they are releasing the 3rd edition of the board game soon which I am sure will be the main focus for many players for this universe. LOTR LCG is unique on the other hand. There is no other LOTR themed game of that scale. I considered for a second to get into the Arkham LCG but then thought to myself that Elder Sign covers me (although a different type of game). Plus my friend has the board game so we are covered there as well. How much more Lovecraft theme can someone digest. \n\nEdited October 13, 2018 by Gandalf_"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284453-worse-than-i-thought/?do=findComment&comment=3502459","commentId":3502459,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1539458203,"content":"Arkham has the advantage of being based on a public domain work -- no license fee.  So even if it sold exactly the same as LOTR, the profit motive would be greater for Arkham.  It's also not vulnerable to the license running out.\n\nHowever, given that LOTR material, when they bother to produce it, still sells out quickly I'm not especially worried that LOTR will be ended for being unprofitable.  I choose to incent FFG to produce material by buying it when it comes out.  Do I wish they'd produce more and quicker?  Absolutely.  But I'm not going to cut off my nose to spite my face."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284453-worse-than-i-thought/?do=findComment&comment=3502484","commentId":3502484,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1539460072,"content":"I don't mind a slowdown of content, it's the lag between announcements/releases and the delay between packs of the same cycle that frustrates me. \n\nI'd rather they went most of the year releasing nothing (maybe some nightmare), and then released a deluxe and cycle over a few months."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284453-worse-than-i-thought/?do=findComment&comment=3502639","commentId":3502639,"userName":"Stewart777","timestamp":1539474317,"content":"I see what you guys are saying, but playing devils advocate for a sec - this game is 7 years old and just look at the amount of games that have been released over that period.

I can't believe how bad FFG is at getting their products into the hands of the customers who want them.\n\nI don't quite agree with your assertion about power creep, though. Or to be more precise, I think the big jump in player card power happened in Dwarrowdelf (the second cycle) and the encounter cards caught up after that. Since then, the power level has been surprisingly flat, such that many older quests are still competitive against many modern decks.\n\nI actually run a blog series [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/] to investigate this stuff, and I've found it's still fun to play the game out of release order. The biggest problem you'll run into, I think, is the rising complexity of new archetypes; nothing is quite as straightforward to play as it was back in the early days.

This makes any overstock in a warehouse or slow-moving products on a store shelf deadly, for publishers, distributors and retailers alike. There are also big increases in shipping, storage, employee wages, etc. Physical products in general are going to only become more expensive with time (until we get Replicators).\n\nFFG's solution seems to be to have slim production runs. Far better to run out of copies and lose some sales than to overprint and have your revenue destroyed by dead product, or so they seem to be thinking.\n\nAs a retailer selling their products, I can't fault them for this strategy. I have to sell about 3 copies of a game to see any return on investment. That might not be too hard to do if the store were only full of hot sellers, but half of the new games that come out struggle to sell even 1 copy. For every game like that, suddenly I need some other similarly-priced game sell 4-5 copies instead of just 3, not only make a profit on itself but to make up for the failure of the slower product.\n\nThe end result is that the cult of the new is almost a requirement in this industry. \"Evergreen\" products are not really ever green. Most of them dwindle over the years, and they can't afford to sit on their laurels and let the hobby mellow. There always needs to be a push for the next hit game, even if it's at the expense of steady sales in an established game. They can't afford to wait for LotR to cool off before they start to think of what comes after it.\n\nEdited November 21, 2018 by JohnGarrison1870"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284453-worse-than-i-thought/?do=findComment&comment=3558119","commentId":3558119,"userName":"BigKahuna","timestamp":1544016315,"content":"Board game publishing/design and everything else that goes into it is a high risk, with little reward the vast majority of the time business.  Game makers like FFG do well because they have built up a reputation and work in larger volumes with a built in audience using some of the beloved franchises among gamers which is in part while they are successful but suffice to say the overwhelming vast majority of game makers largely fail to turn a profit worth speaking of and even when they do it might be enough to pay the rent and the investment for the next one.  I would wager your chances of becoming rich making a board game are about as good as playing the lottery.\n\nIts why things like kickstarter are so popular as it takes the risk out of the whole thing for developers/publishers of games and why the current trend that a small select of audience capturing publishers are buying up all of these smaller companies.  It's all an effort to raise volumes and decrease costs, in particular for international distribution.\n\nSuffice to say the idea of the \"small game\" is dying a very painful death at least in the mass market and many people who might in the past have worked for smaller companies to get their games published are going into self-publishing using services like Kickstarter and Gamecrafters to publish their games.  Effectively removing the business risks entirely.  I mean if you want to find the next generation of great board game designers your less likely to find them working for FFG and more likely to find them publishing their games on Gamecrafters.\n\nGames like Lord of the Rings LCG are kind of part of a dying breed.  Its just a bit too niche for the overhead of modern distribution.  5 years ago it was iffy, today its becoming increasingly unlikely.  Even games like Star Wars Destiny are struggling and they are backed by FFG and the Star Wars franchise... yet still its struggling.  What's worse is that typically high points of sales like Christmas are becoming instead \"belt tighting\" moments for people, where they spend less not more money than usual, a sign that the economy is shifting for the worse.  With craziness like US's Trump and UK's Brexit going on, the prospects for the future are not that great and niche products on the market like a collectable card game about Lord of the Rings is not likely to survive the economic shifts coming down the pipe."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284453-worse-than-i-thought/?do=findComment&comment=3558495","commentId":3558495,"userName":"j_gunder","timestamp":1544036398,"content":"Nice post, BK.  Agree with you about basically everything.\n\nWhether it is indeed dying off slowly or whether they're considering a reboot, I'm fine with it either way.  And that's coming from the perspective of someone who has purchased everything since the beginning.  Our group has been gradually making our way through the material and having a GREAT time doing it (with the exception of a few quests that have been extremely difficult), we're about 2/3s through all of the printed material.\n\nThe game has become bogged down in options and the struggle to keep creep in check is evident.  Still an awesome game, still super fun, and there have been some really great innovations in the later material--but I miss the simplicity and charm of some of the earlier quests.  I think FFG has learned a lot in the last couple years, and if a reboot is in the works, sign me up!  If not, I'll enjoy the next couple months of material I have left and will be glad to retire it until I'm ready to replay everything!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284453-worse-than-i-thought/?do=findComment&comment=3559078","commentId":3559078,"userName":"Crusaderlord","timestamp":1544090320,"content":"Lots of interesting thoughts - the fact that print runs both of new releases and older packs sell out quick tends to suggest the game is popular enough to keep supporting - so maybe there is hope yet for a continuation.\n\nWhat would be really annoying is if the game is effectively cancelled with no more chances to get some of the older packs or cycles skipped.
