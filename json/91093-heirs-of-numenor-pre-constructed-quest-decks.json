I know that there are still two quests to go, but there are still a few encounter sets unused as well... So we might be able to pre-construct all six quests without having to buy a second heirs of numenor box\n\nSounds good to me, I hope they keep that up in all the future cycles because it's a pain having to separate out all the encounter sets all the time"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91093-heirs-of-numenor-pre-constructed-quest-decks/?do=findComment&comment=876152","commentId":876152,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1380249241,"content":"I had the same hopes, but Blood of Gondor uses the Ravaging Orcs sets.  That is the same set used by EaAD.  I also have this feeling that the Morgul Vale with use Mordor Elite, which is used by AoO."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91093-heirs-of-numenor-pre-constructed-quest-decks/?do=findComment&comment=876333","commentId":876333,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1380286877,"content":"They shouldn't avoid using encounter sets for this reason - I'd rather have more complex quests and need 2 sets.  They'd also rather I bought 2 sets.\n\n \n\n(I don't mind shuffling quest decks and make do with 1 set :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png])"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91093-heirs-of-numenor-pre-constructed-quest-decks/?do=findComment&comment=876367","commentId":876367,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1380291147,"content":"Sorting out encounter deck by icons can be tedious, but the card number (like, 7/12, 3/8) makes it easy to keep track and make sure you haven't lost any cards.
