I think my playing style would probably be conducive to using it. And since a lot of Lore allies are 3+ for cost, it would be a great replacement for Lore of Imladris. I, too, wonder how Healing Herbs will work in Rhosgobel.\n\nDurin's Axe is great. I have no complaints about it. I think it's interesting that many objectives are guarded, causing another encounter card to be placed in the staging area, but this one has surge instead. I think that's a good move because it wouldn't make sense for this to be guarded. What do orcs care about this axe?\n\nPath of Need is probably the most controversial card from this pack. I'm really interested to see how it plays. It certainly will take some strategy to use. If you don't have to exhaust to quest while it is attached to the active location, it could be really easy to over-commit and remove the location from the staging area, meaning you won't get the benefit of attacking/defending for free. Then again, you would get to attack/defend in the round in which you traveled to the location Path of Need was attached to, assuming you played it on a location in the staging area rather than directly on the active location. I think it's very interesting that they've limited it to one per deck. It'll be a lot harder to find it in your deck with only one copy. You know, this would be a great card to put on The Carrock in Conflict at the Carrock. Then you just make sure you have 4 allies to die and enough combined attack with your heroes to fell a troll. You don't need to keep your threat low because you could just knock each one out in the round they engage you. EDIT: Better yet, if all three heroes have a Tactics icon, you just let the trolls engage and use Thicket of Spears to prevent their attacks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640148","commentId":640148,"userName":"FAAx87","timestamp":1338813799,"content":"Path of Need on Durins Door …"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640153","commentId":640153,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1338814577,"content":"^^^^^^ yes……let me think about that for a moment- very interesting indeed"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640154","commentId":640154,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1338814610,"content":"Path of Need could be crazy.

Then while it is a very strong card, is it really that much more powerful than Grim Resolve. The answer is probably yes, it is more powerful, heroes can do whatever while it is activated but to trigger its effect is certainly more complicated. You play it as an attachment so you shall have the location active by the time you go questing and then it will be gone if you quest well enough, if you don't quest well enough, what's the point of playing it? Battle! I am sure it will find its uses - new combos will likely show up soon but for now I am not really psyched about it. In fact I see no reason of the deck restriction to a single copy but time may prove me fool.\n\nNeither do I think the herbs too good. I find Warden of Healing a much stronger card.

If you've only got 2 heroes, you need them to do more than in a standard deck, and giving it a secrecy card would have made it more accessible to those decks. I suppose it only takes 2 rounds of Steward of Gondor to get enough resources for this card, and if both your heroes are Leadership and SoG is on the table, you should be able to buy this in a single round.

If you switch out the location that has Path of Need attached then it would seem that no one is committed to the quest. In order for Path of Need to activate it needs to be attached to the \"active location\". By removing the active location Path of Need no longer applies. If my thinking is correct the quest phase could be disastorous…no progress would be put on the location you swapped or the quest because no progress would be gained.

If you can make good use of Strider's Path, anyway (and why not?), then go ahead and work it into a combo. That's good stuff. Otherwise, with my luck, I'd be worried that Path of Need would be at the bottom of my deck. Sure, I can draw there, but will I draw there before it's too late to get the boost?\n\nMeanwhile, I have to agree that the Dwarrowdelf cards are more powerful on the whole than the Mirkwood cards, but the power of cards isn't an even field. It's a spiky chart, and there are definitely some powerful cards from the Shadows of Mirkwood. Boromir, anyone? Still, until they make another card that deals with Treachery effects, A Test of Will is hands-down the strongest card in the game. I'm not a fan of Sleeping Sentry. I think it creates a \"false\" gaming experience. If the encounter deck is meant to \"play\" against us, then it should start getting the edge and push an advantage. When it hits, Sleeping Sentry doesn't capitalize on an advantage; it just wins. But for all the griping about the card, it's easy to deal with the Treachery effect with A Test of Will. (And to deal with the Shadow effect with Hasty Stroke and/or Burning Brand.)\n\nAs I see it, the problem isn't that the Dwarrowdelf cards are stronger than the Mirkwood cards. It's that there are still aspects of the game (treachery cancellation) that are only addressed by one card. Until we have multiple cards that perform similar functions (albeit in different ways), we have auto-include cards.\n\nZigil Miner may or may not be too strong, but it helps move away from the \"auto-include\" status of Steward of Gondor. Path of Need may or may not be too strong, but it's certainly not an auto-include. If anything, it gives players with expensive Zigil Miner decks something else to toy with instead of Grim Resolve.\n\nAnd if you're like Boooored and don't think you can have fun with such powerful cards… um, don't play them?

Sure you can just not play it.. but wouldn't it be better if they just designed GOOD cards instead?\n\n\n\n \n\nCards that give such a different approach to the game are good.  It keeps thing from getting stale.  The challenge of building a deck to maximize the ability of a single card in a 50 card deck is appealing to me.  After I have experimented with it, Path of Need will get filed away with cards like Zigil Miner.  When I see future cards that compliment it's strengths and overcome it's weaknesses, I might use it again.  Until then, I will enjoy building new decks.  Half the challenge of card games is designing a deck that is able to deal with almost anything that your opponent can throw at you.  And if there are cards that allow us to do that in new and exciting ways, all the better!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640608","commentId":640608,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1338898950,"content":"@ the janitor - i agree, but i get exited no matter what cards comes out, as i usually spend the first 5 minutes looking at the artwork! i dont know how long youve been on the forum/playing the game, however we have had this argument about 5 times over now, so im just warning you, there is a definate split in players who take your side and players who takes booored and others….of course there's people in the middle as usual, but i think those who have chosen sides would have budged the first time round if they were going to happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]…..some people see it as new fresh approaches….some bad design…………"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640689","commentId":640689,"userName":"Robert McMutton","timestamp":1338907100,"content":"About this new card Path of Need, well, you are commenting a lot of it, but you are losing the best part (as richsabre noted), the amazing art of Magali Villeneuve lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].

Some say Steward in every deck, I can do without, I really enjoy Zigil combos, some are bored (no pun intended), some think Gimli is the thing, I think he's the worst Tactics hero… sorry to be giving personal examples but that's how it comes to mind. People have different views and they enjoy, at least quite a few it seems. Some say the game's too easy, some say too hard.\n\nAs for the former, it took me some time to realize it is Boromir in the picture (arrows, shield, horn, of course), I got confused by the quotes. And yes, MV is taking the spotlight, if you only take player cards, I think she might have like 20% in this cycle (2 per pack). There's no one else to compete with that frequency, although BZ is having quite a few locations which I find mostly gorgeous. I am not actually checking much from the enemy, treachery art, is there someone who appears much more frequently than others?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640705","commentId":640705,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1338908907,"content":"i do not believe so….it seems they are more focused when it comes to player cards- ill have to check\n\ni think the major characters or 'important' cards such as path of need  always get more attention when it comes to art- makes sense i suppose"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=640819","commentId":640819,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1338929476,"content":"Look, maybe I am being a little harsh… yes it is true unless you get the combo out the attachment is not long for this world.. unless you have something like impassable bog out with 7 or w/e quest points.

If the card said, \"Attach a location to Path of Need.\" I would see that as an effect and The Carrock would be immune to it. As it is written, the card has no effect on the active location. It is not moving the active location and it is not adding progress to the active location. It simply says \"Attach to a location,\" which is an effect on the card, not the location. If The Carrock said, \"Immune to player cards,\" again, I would concede that Path of Need could not work.\n\nHmm. I'm still thinking about this. \"Attach to a location\" is a player card effect, and I suppose the target of the effect is indeed the location, so maybe Richsabre is right. Grrr!

Is an attachment a player card effect ON the location. Say an Mathom… the effect is happening ON the Mathom card not on the location and triggered when teh location leaves play..… This is kind of like the target effect rule. Targeting a location specifically with an affect (not a card) is different that a global effect that targets all cards of a certain type on the board… EG: Dark Knowledge is a targeted affect and Burning Brand is not.\n\nThis is a very common thing and is in CoC, aGoT and a famous example is in magic the gathering Wrath of God vs Lightning Bolt.\n\nI think technically this immune to player effects is talking about targeted affects.. so Northern Tracker, Lorian Guide, Shadowborn Scout, Riddermark Finest etc etc etc.. .there are tons.. these are all cards that target the location and resolves ON the location effecting the location itself. The Mathom or in this case this new card I hate effects is not occouring on the location. The effect is not targeting the location, nor is the effect doing anything to the location at all.\n\nThis is how the rule read to me on a techy level. So I think yes you can cast this on such places.. BUT I also think this is NOT what the designers mean. After playing this game form release I have a feel for their terrible wording and it very well could be talking about all player \"card\" interaction not player \"effects\".\n\nMight need a ruling on this form nate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=641265","commentId":641265,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1339009501,"content":"The Janitor said:\n\nPoint taken.

Tragic said it best in his 3 player deck construction video. In LoTR (say in a 3 player game) you are making ONE DECK that is getting played by three people at once.

The ONLY cards that need to be in any given deck are allies as they can only be played on your side.\n\nAny events and attachments can be placed in any deck regardless of witch deck has targets.\n\nIf you build a 2 player deck and try to make them both in teh same way you build a a solo deck all you are doing is diluting the power of the decks as a whole function for a given game situation. It is much better to specialise each deck for certain functions.\n\nThis is exactly how you build a solo deck, as in you have to build a solo deck to handle many game situations at once… when building a multiplayer deck you do the same thing but to strength the power of the deck to deal with these situations you can specialise each individual deck.\n\nThis is one of the hardest concepts for deck designers who come to this game to work out. It is a typical newish player mistake, especially for those that come from other deck construction games because (as far as I know) LoTRlcg is the only game that has these completely interdependent deck setups.\n\nYou really need to consider the two decks as a single deck, and build it accordingly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65503-new-preview-great-attatchment/?do=findComment&comment=641384","commentId":641384,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1339050360,"content":"I do like to build a questing deck, deck for combat, deck that draws cards, deck that earns resources, yes, but then I don't want to be bound to play say deck A with deck B, I like variety so I am glad if deck A can also play with deck C or D.
