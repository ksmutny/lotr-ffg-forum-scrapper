The doubt was if the unique rule didn't apply what will become when the players with the same unique card in play do when they join each other.\n\n \n\nThe problem here is the reading of the FoS rule: \n\nEllrohir and Elladan cards are affected by one another.\n\nThe effect on the card is a constant one but needs a condition to be met to do it's effect: in this case the condition is the other card being in play. And the fact they need that condition, is where they are affected by the other, so they need to be in the same staging area to affect the other, because of the FoS rule.\n\n \n\nYou need to think that each staging area is a different play area and it is only affected by the cards that are in play on that staging area.\n\n \n\nHope this clarifies my position. If not feel free to ask any doubts\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77357-foundations-of-stone-questions/?do=findComment&comment=748912","commentId":748912,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1358407264,"content":"And you are correct sir!  I received this response from Caleb:\n\n\" Because cards in one staging area cannot affect the cards in another staging area (except for uniqueness), Elladan and Elrohir do not get their bonus stats if they are in separate staging areas.  Cheers, Caleb\"\n\nSo it looks like the unique rule is just an exception in this case and can't be used to extrapolate about rules affecting other cards\n\nThanks for the discussion!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/77357-foundations-of-stone-questions/?do=findComment&comment=749642","commentId":749642,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1358512356,"content":"Nice to know that you got an official reply, in either way.\n\n \n\nGlad to know that my interpretation was correct."}]}
