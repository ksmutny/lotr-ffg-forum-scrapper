Or would Ungoliant Spawn be considered already 'defeated' because it's in the victory display?\n\n\n\nAs always, thanks much!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300400-what-does-defeat-mean-re-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=3792268","commentId":3792268,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1569333085,"content":"The more commonly used term you will see is “destroyed,” but if you see “defeated,” I assume those two words to be equivalent. Some specific answers: \n\n1) yes, that is correct. \n\n2) no, being discarded does not count as being defeated. And being defeated does not count as being discarded either (matters for some player card effects). \n\n3) correct\n\n4) the game would just be stuck in limbo until you threat out or otherwise lose. Chalk it up to limited design vision in some of the early scenarios in the game. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300400-what-does-defeat-mean-re-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=3792278","commentId":3792278,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1569333725,"content":"Quoting GrandSpleen for everything, just adding that for Number 4 you can take some ideas from the later quest The RedHorn Gate, which had a similar situation with Caradhras and made the players search also the Victory Display for the card, just to avoid similar scenarios  (and in later cycles problems like these are completely avoided thanks to having key cards out of play at the start of the game and then put in play at the right time)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300400-what-does-defeat-mean-re-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=3792279","commentId":3792279,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1569333751,"content":"To parenthetically add to @GrandSpleen [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/177891-grandspleen/], re: #2… Despite being referenced a few times, I don't believe defeat(ed) is ever formally defined in the Rules Reference/Learn to Play/FAQ—an oversight. However, going back to the original Core rulebook yields the expected definition:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Any time [an enemy or character] has 0 hit points, it is immediately defeated.\n\nThus indeed, something like Great Hunt does not qualify for defeating an enemy."}]}
