Asmodee's acquiring of FFG may have something to do with it as well (lack of enthusiasm for game, less support).\n\n> 44 minutes ago, player1683311 said:\n> \n> Grey company has slowed considerably and have really just been doing book club which is cool, but I'd love more game content. \n\nThey should be back to normal after they finish RotK"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280922-someone-told-me/?do=findComment&comment=3441562","commentId":3441562,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1534343558,"content":"> On 8/13/2018 at 6:35 AM, John Constantine said:\n> \n> It amazes me how people keep starting new blogs, podcasts, etc. for a game with as low demand for this as LotR LCG.\n\nI think if one were to start a blog whose main focus was 1) whether or not to sleeve cards, and 2) what kind of box to store the game in, you would have a smashing success."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280922-someone-told-me/?do=findComment&comment=3441673","commentId":3441673,"userName":"CDavis7M","timestamp":1534347393,"content":"There's a certain community college professor making a living doing just that."}]}
