I ruled that you would be able to take the damage, but the effect would get cancelled because Beechbone would no longer be in play?\n\n \n\nSecondly, if The Power of Angmar is in play (http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-lost-realm/the-power-of-angmar-r1333 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-lost-realm/the-power-of-angmar-r1333]) stopping you being able to remove cards from your discard pile, are you able to play Lord of the Eldar?

Then, until the end of the round all Noldor character get +1 [Willpower], +1 [Attack], and +1 [Defense]. \n\n \n\nI would say this clearly cannot be played since you cannot resolve the first effect, and the second effect is dependent on the first effect resolution.\n\nEdited December 2, 2015 by shosuko"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194422-a-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1915295","commentId":1915295,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1449029556,"content":"In a recent video, Matt Newman immediately shot down the idea of Beechbone's ability continuing after he was killed.  Here's the video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpohKcmOtBY] and they talk about it at about 8:25. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194422-a-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1915607","commentId":1915607,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1449054547,"content":"Make sense with the new ruling of «checking the state when a lasting event should affect something» where we check current ressource on the heroes when using Blood of Numenor.\n\nSo, when you resolve \"where X is the number of damage\" it is 0 since it's dead."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194422-a-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1917151","commentId":1917151,"userName":"Farjord","timestamp":1449147606,"content":"Thank you all very much for your answers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
