So I dealt the shadow card to the enemy with the highest engagement cost, and the other 4 enemies did not get one (yay!) as per the rules.\n\nOne of my heros had Watchful Eyes attached, which forces you to reveal a card from the encounter deck if the hero isn't ready at the end of the combat phase. But I needed to use him to help kill off the enemies, and had used up all my readying on defenders.\n\nAm I right in thinking that I am free to use this hero this phase, effectively without triggering Watchful Eyes, as the encounter deck is now empty, so I cannot reveal a card from it?\n\n(I played it this way.)\n\nEdited November 21 by steve83"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/312703-revealing-cards-outside-of-the-quest-phase-with-empty-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=4018309","commentId":4018309,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1606018706,"content":"Yes.

I was thinking in the context of the deck resetting, the beginning of the quest phase is the first opportunity.\n\nAlthough even that is incorrect... you could play a guarded card and that would reset it first"}]}
