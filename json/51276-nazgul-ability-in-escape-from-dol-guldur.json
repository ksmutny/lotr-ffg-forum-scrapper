Players may play event cards and take actions at the end of each step.\"\n\nSo then, you can play Sneak Attack + Son of Arnor from your hand between steps. Son of Arnor has a Response, which is activated the moment he enters play (i.e. from an event like Sneak Attack). It reads \"After Son of Arnor enters play, choose an enemy card in the staging area or currently engaged with another player. Engage that enemy.\"\n\nThen again, Nazgul is engaged with the other player. You (the player who comboes Sneak Attack + Son of Arnor) can \"break\" his engagement and make the card yours. When you do that, the Nazgul is NOT attacking, because is not your turn, but the second player's turn, and the Nazgul NOW is not engaged with him. And you did that BEFORE the revealing of the Shadow Effect and BEFORE combat/damage recount. So no calculations were made and the shadow card is discarded.\n\nWhen the second player finishes the combat phase, we pass to the next player's combat phase. If there are no more players (that means, ALL the player did his combat phase, and in our example the player that did the combo was the first in doing that, so player 1 and 2 have made it), they proceed no the next phase (Refreshment). And Son of Arnor returns before the new phase starts to the owner's hand (Sneak Attack).\n\nI hope that my \"slow\" description was of more help :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=513135","commentId":513135,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1313079253,"content":"Yeah, that description is clear :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  I completely agree that all of the card plays are legal.  My complaint is that the rulebook isn't clear on what happens to an attack declared against a player that is no longer engaged with the attacking enemy after the attack has already begun.  I am very hopeful that we'll get an official response to this soon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=513496","commentId":513496,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1313138635,"content":"Wow, and I thought I had Son of Arnor covered, as it is one of my favourite cards.\n\nJust to make the card more obviously awesome for others, too, I would add that not only Sneak Attack is the great combo but also Stand and Fight. They work just the same for the effect in that particular phase, the difference: Stand and Fight costs 3 Spirit tokens instead of 1 Leadership; but Son of Arnor stays instead of going back to hand.\n\nBack to the point. So, you are the first player, the other player has Nazgul engaged, in that case you can just Sneak (or Stand) Son in after the attacks against you were made. Vice versa, you are not the first player, the other player has Nazgul engaged, if you then interupt the fighting sequence, the attack has no bearing (beside perhaps playing some event cards affecting it, like Swift Strike) but then you get Nazgul and have to deal with it.

You do your defending, then ****** the enemy from the player who were about to do his. I have always played it thus.\n\n\n\n \n\nIt is interesting, and strange that the combo has a significantly different effect depending when it is played in the round. It almost throws some question marks around the validity of using SoA before the attack starts, does that really mean the Nazgul misses an attack that round?  From the rules though that seems clear how that should be played and is now the only sensible way to play SoA and Sneak attack.\n\nBased on the rules though i would never have surmised the damage was dealt to the player who played SoA....\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51276-nazgul-ability-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=514089","commentId":514089,"userName":"Jekzer","timestamp":1313248210,"content":"radiskull said:\n\nPlayer 2 did not declare defenders (he couldn't), so yes, one of player 2's heroes will take all the damage.\n\nIf player 1 already defended, I think that player 2 engaging the Nazgul would be a bad idea, but I would extrapolate that instead of being defended by player 1, it becomes undefended by player 2.\n\nOnce player 1's enemies finish attacking him, player 2's enemies will attack him, including the Nazgul (again) in this case.  There aren't two combat phases in a row, the first Nazgul attack came during the part of the combat phase where enemies attack player 1.  The rules state that you repeat the combat steps \"for each enemy that [you are] engaged with.\"  Thus, it doesn't matter that the Nazgul already attacked player 1.  It is engaging player 2 during the time when enemies attack player 2, thus it attacks.\n\nFinally, shadow cards attach to an enemy, so if the enemy moves after step 2, so does its shadow card, which will then be revealed in step 3.\n\n \n\nPresumably, if you moved the Nazgul after step 1, the second player would then have the opportunity to declare one of HIS defenders, since it moved before the \"Declare Defenders\" step.\n\n \n\nP.S.  I'm using male pronouns because that's what the game does.  I in no way want to disparage any female gamers.  What I wouldn't give for English to have a non-awkward, gender-neutral, singular personal pronoun.  Sigh...\n\n\n\n \n\nSo, to sum up: let's say that player 1 already defended successfully all the attacks from his engaged monsters. So he finishes his \"defense sub-phase\". We move to player 2 (he has the nasty Nazgul engaged and is the only one). Player 1 decides to play the combo Sneak Attack + SoA after dealing the shadow card. Then player 2 ends his defense phase (no engagements now). And now we return to player 1, because he has a new engaged enemy (even if he already passed successfully his defense sub-phase)?
