But….\n\n1. In the setup of The Hunt for Gollum I revealed the treachery card 'Old Wives' Tales' which states \"Discard 1 resource from each hero's resource pool, if able. Exhaust any hero that could not discard a resource from its pool\". Assuming I am playing this right, no resources would have been assigned yet as it is only the setup stage so would every hero would have to exhaust? I played it as such, which made the first round very tricky!\n\n2. Stage 1b and 2b of the quest deck states that \"After the players quest successfully, the first player looks at the top 3/2 cards of the encounter deck. Reveal and add 1 of those cards to the staging area, and discard the other/other 2 cards\". If I reveal Eastern Crows do I then need to satisfy the surge element and reveal an extra card from the deck?\n\nThanks in advance for your help with this (and apologies again if it has already been asked and answered)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73747-the-hunt-for-gollum-questions/?do=findComment&comment=718750","commentId":718750,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1352017092,"content":"Chaos101 said:\n\nHi All,\n\nSorry if these queries are repeated but the search facility doesn't seem to work on my PC and I'm not trawling through 140 pages of posts to find out if this has already been asked.
