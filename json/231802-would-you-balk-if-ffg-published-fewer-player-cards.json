As the game grows, the number of possible decks has exploded, to the point where the addition of just one new card sometimes opens up a new deck archetype, usually with multiple variations (e.g., Strider, Sword-Thain, Elven Light, Gather Information). And nearly every hero opens up a new deck archetype.\n\n \n\nI would almost rather see just a few player cards published each cycle (say, 8 in a deluxe and 2 in each adventure pack), especially if those player cards that did get published were of the calibre of the examples I gave above. The adventure packs themselves might start to include two quests instead of just one, or to include encounter card setups that make use of the larger number of cards. Heck, maybe they'd start to publish the nightmare decks simultaneously and include them in the adventure pack!\n\n \n\nI'm not even sure this change would decrease sales of the game - I enjoy playing the new quests, especially because I'm interested in seeing what new ways the designers have come up with to challenge us or to smash powerful deck archetypes. And, if the player cards were as game-changing as some of the examples I gave above, I certainly wouldn't mind. As it is, only about half of the player cards that I get these days actually make it into decks. Partly this is because of a lack of time on my part, and partly because some of the player cards are very conditional and require careful deck-building (Master Ironsmith, Guarded Ceaselessly, Arrows from the Trees, Scouting Party).\n\n \n\nBut I digress. My original query was: would you balk if FFG published fewer player cards?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231802-would-you-balk-if-ffg-published-fewer-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2446671","commentId":2446671,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1475807918,"content":"I wouldn't balk, but I wouldn't like it either. It literally took us years for the card pool to get deep enough where multiple deck styles could be considered tier 1. Fewer player cards means a slower evolving metagame. Also, this naturally means more encounter cards which means that the encounter deck size grows.

I love the amount of player cards we get. Even if they don't make it into my decks I really enjoy receiving the vast majority of player cards that we get just for their art, theme and the fact they may be great in future decks I build. Just because they don't end up in my decks doesn't mean they won't end up in somebody elses either. The abundance of player cards is what opens up deckbuilding. If we just received 2 player cards and they were always power cards or cards that make a huge difference/change the meta of the game everyone would eventually end up with extremely similar decks all rocking the same power cards.\n\nSome people don't like the best of the best of player cards, some people like to play easy mode with subpar decks.\n\nSome just want to play thematically and don't care about deck power etc.\nAlso sometimes the cards you think are coasters end up being gems in later decks you build. Some new cards we get make older cards more playable (any time we get cost reducers older more resource intensive cards are given a slight boost).\n\nI'm not sure I've ever played another card game that has such a small and slowly growing card pool for players than this one. I come from a Magic background though so this was always going to be the case for me. To reduce an already extremely low amount of cards per pack to me just doesn't make sense. I mean it makes a little bit more sense towards the end of the game when we already have a good pool of player cards but even then I'd prefer if they stick to the one hero and nine player cards format. To be completely honest I would probably rather an extra player card or two!!! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231802-would-you-balk-if-ffg-published-fewer-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2446761","commentId":2446761,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1475816649,"content":"That would be a \"bye-bye\" for me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231802-would-you-balk-if-ffg-published-fewer-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=2446785","commentId":2446785,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1475820334,"content":"I could easily handle a cardpool that was double the current size. 2 cards per pack?
