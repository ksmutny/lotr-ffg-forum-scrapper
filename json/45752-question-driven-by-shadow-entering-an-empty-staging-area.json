As a result of this, I revealed an additional card from the Encounter Deck (East Bight Patrol).\n\nNow that I have an Enemy in the Staging Area, does Driven By Shadow still get to add +1 Threat to the Patrol? Or is the total effect of DBS upon an empty staging area simply to reveal an additional card?\n\nMany Thanks.\n\n \n\n \n\n  \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45752-question-driven-by-shadow-entering-an-empty-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=458723","commentId":458723,"userName":"Hastur360","timestamp":1303723025,"content":"Both things happen. You flip Driven By Shadow, it's effect goes off, Each enemy and location currently  in the staging area gets +1 Threat until the end of the phase. Then it checks the empty staging area and then surges.  So when you flip the Patrol it will not get the +1 Threat as it was not currently in the staging area when the first part of Driven By Shadow took effect.\n\n \n\n-Edited this once Widowmaker pointed out the currently. Was using the info from the living card database which does not include the word currently. So I checked my actual card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45752-question-driven-by-shadow-entering-an-empty-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=458729","commentId":458729,"userName":"Widowmaker93","timestamp":1303724061,"content":"Yeah if you read DBS you will see that it has that nifty little word \"currently\" in the text describing who gets the +1 threat (i.e. Each enemy and location currently in the staging area....\").  Therefore when it's effect is resolved there are no enemies in the staging area so no one gets the +1 and DBS activates it's surge effect bringing in EBP. They will not get the +! threat since when the card checked for legal targets there were none \"currently\" in the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45752-question-driven-by-shadow-entering-an-empty-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=458760","commentId":458760,"userName":"ChinaBlade2","timestamp":1303727251,"content":"Many Thanks for this clear and speedy help.\n\nI would definitely be unable to play this game without access to these forums - my list of clarifications is getting as long as the Rules themselves!\n\nVery Best Regards."}]}
