Each questing character not chosen does not count its [Willpower] until the end of the turn.\n\nWhen would this ever be relevant?  Normally you have already quested successfully and were able to advance to this quest during the Quest phase at a point where Willpower is no longer relevant.  Otherwise, you have an option to skip it during the Combat phase.\n\nPerhaps I didn't face an Encounter card yet where this would matter, but I don't understand how you'd reveal this quest before the Quest phase or before the Quest step has already resolved where Willpower would still be relevant."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62144-search-for-an-exit-narrow-paths/?do=findComment&comment=608344","commentId":608344,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332322200,"content":"if you commit you characters then flip the quest card at the staging step as you have to, then you are going to get less willpower than expected when it coes to quest resolution\n\ni think thats right.................otherwise im confused as per usual!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62144-search-for-an-exit-narrow-paths/?do=findComment&comment=608349","commentId":608349,"userName":"Bomb","timestamp":1332322592,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nif you commit you characters then flip the quest card at the staging step as you have to, then you are going to get less willpower than expected when it coes to quest resolution\n\ni think thats right.................otherwise im confused as per usual!\n\n\n\nI think you are probably correct then.  I may have ****** up playing Flight from Moria for the first time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62144-search-for-an-exit-narrow-paths/?do=findComment&comment=608351","commentId":608351,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332322868,"content":"yes, you always have to wait and flip quest cards at the start of the staging step, then carry out what the card says"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62144-search-for-an-exit-narrow-paths/?do=findComment&comment=608354","commentId":608354,"userName":"Bomb","timestamp":1332323102,"content":"Well I still lost so no harm done.  :-)  I actually stopped reading side 2A after I realized they were all the same."}]}
