Thanks.\n\n \n\n \n\nI'd say it's possible, although it thematically makes no sense that a sacked hero is receiving stuff by other members of his fellowship. \"Collect\" means that the hero is actively gathering resources, while \"add\" means that he is provided with resources. That's why \"Parting Gifts\" should also work, and Bifur could use his ability (which is also passive) to get some extra resources.\n\n \n\nNow I have that picture of a Zigil Miner in mind, who happily drops his gold next to the sacked hero - and walks away singing and whistling into the sunset, while the hero desperately tries to get rid of his gag to curse the Miner."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60081-sacked-and-ziggy/?do=findComment&comment=590458","commentId":590458,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1328521558,"content":"Here are what the rules say about the resource phase\n\n\"Each player simultaneously adds 1 resource token to\neach of his heroes’ resource pools.

If you look at dict.leo.org there are about 20 possible translations for \"collect\". Some of the other translations fit with what you're saying, in the sense of gathering or accumulating resources."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60081-sacked-and-ziggy/?do=findComment&comment=590607","commentId":590607,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1328541594,"content":"I think there was a lot of linguistic slippage in the core set, and, to a lesser extent, throughout Mirkwood.  The designers didn't sit down and define a lexicon of game terms, and used language inconsistently in card design (a problem that only gets magnified in translation).  The use of 'add' and 'collect' to mean the same thing is an example of the lack of linguistic precision.  I love the game, but trying to parse card wording closely can get you in trouble."}]}
