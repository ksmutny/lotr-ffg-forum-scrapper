The more players you have, the more likely you will get this card early in the game. Feint is rather unreliable in this scenario. I play solo and I have Counterspell attached to DB in almost every second game. However, Feint is one of the few event cards that were in all of my S&F decks so far. I play only two copies btw whih makes it less likely to have it in my starting hand. (message: don't claim that the game is too easy when you' re using two core sets lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif])\n\n \n\nFurthermore: Hama + Feint being dull is true for every scenario!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69822-hamafeint-and-durins-bane/?do=findComment&comment=681765","commentId":681765,"userName":"PESKPESK","timestamp":1345878127,"content":"Well even with Counter-spell, it’s almost broken if you combine it with Denthor/Henamarth Riversong and use their ability peek at the encounter deck to mess with the Counter-spell ( Move treachery to the bottom of the deck, play another even first, knowing when to try a different tactics this round etc.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69822-hamafeint-and-durins-bane/?do=findComment&comment=681962","commentId":681962,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1345907530,"content":"PESKPESK said:\n\nWell even with Counter-spell, it’s almost broken if you combine it with Denthor/Henamarth Riversong and use their ability peek at the encounter deck to mess with the Counter-spell ( Move treachery to the bottom of the deck, play another even first, knowing when to try a different tactics this round etc.)\n\n\n\nYes that how you do it.

That, and well, you need to have it in your starting hand. True, you have a mulligan and everything, but if your whole game hangs on this, it's still risky.\n\nBut I agree, Hama is just…awesome. He juste redefines the way tactics is played. I had a pretty nasty Beorn + Hama + Thalin deck that simply chewed up anything in its path. I mean…8 atk off the bat, and a guy that could defend everybody without exhausting + the Hama  / feint machine.

So wouldn't it just cancel one of Durin's Banes attacks rather than all of them? Thats how I have been interpretting it so far anyway. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69822-hamafeint-and-durins-bane/?do=findComment&comment=809657","commentId":809657,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373219385,"content":"this is an old thread before that faq changed the ruling i believe. i think thats why it was changed\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69822-hamafeint-and-durins-bane/?do=findComment&comment=809685","commentId":809685,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1373223648,"content":"threadcromancy!!!\n\n \n\nBe sure to check the date, folks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69822-hamafeint-and-durins-bane/?do=findComment&comment=809698","commentId":809698,"userName":"cyberlettuce","timestamp":1373225833,"content":"Ah righty ho I didn't realise it was such an old thread :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
