That's why you construct decks to have extra card drawing power so that this is almost always the case when it matters the most. Admittedly, you can't do that with just the Core Set very well; Ancient Mathom from the Mirkwood cycle is one of the best card-draw specialists, and Bilbo Baggins (not from the Hobbit set, but from the Mirkwood cycle) is a handy hero.\n\nWhat deck are you using? Perhaps people can help. I know my first decks were crap, and it's no good to have a great deck if you don't know how to use it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72136-finally-i-can-solo-core-set-quest-1-with-ease%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=704081","commentId":704081,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1349229243,"content":" I v only bought the core set and 2 large expansions, since i can put them all in one box.

FFG can make all the female non-tolkien characters they want, but if you want official lotr women, then, with the exception of galadriel and a few minor characters, we have them - Arwen and Eowyn. oh and theres the women in the houses of healing but i cant see anyone wanting her in a hurry gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\nand i do hope that ffg concentrate on the official tolkien characters before home-brewing any of their own, i mean theyre plenty of them out there (but no women haha)\n\ni hope ive put that across in the least sexist way possible\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72136-finally-i-can-solo-core-set-quest-1-with-ease%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=704175","commentId":704175,"userName":"ArachneJericho","timestamp":1349252083,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n1. tolkien's world doesnt have many female heros, its the way it is, but at least the heroines he does have are amazing\n\n\n\nTolkien wasn't the greatest when it came to populating his works with female characters.

I combatted with some of my own luck given to me by Beravor. Whom I will never diss again. Ever. She can give you an extra two cards per turn, and that was more than enough to draw out Sneak Attack, all three Gandalfs, Steward of Gondor (with which to play Gandalfs), and more importantly, Forest Snare to snare Ungoliant so that, after killing Ufthak, I devoted the rest of my Gandalfs to damaging Ungoliant.

So far, 2 wins, 2 losses---which isn't bad for a deck thrown together from a limited card pool. On my last game I won I needed to defeat Ungoliant's Spawn… without a Gandalf. I countered the Hummerhorns shadow effect with Hasty Stroke, so I had a ton of allies to attack with. I think if I hadn't had my Hasty Stroke and a few other cards, I would have had Gandalf instead. I already had a Sneak Attack, so boom, boom, Spawn would be dead regardless.\n\nWith Beravor I was able to draw half of my deck through the game (which alleviates luck quite a bit). In games with access to a wider card pool, I've been able to use decks that go through almost ALL of my deck by game's end, setting off almost every combo.\n\nThat said, in the games I lost, I usually made one mistake and it was all over.
