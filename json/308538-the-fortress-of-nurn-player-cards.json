It can perhaps be used with Thorongil, even though I would prefer to fuse Lore Aragorn with its Leadership or Tactics counterpart.\n\nThe contract could be interesting, not only for Hobbits, but the \"exactly 10 card\" restriction might prove bothersome.\n\nHaleth is a good enabler for the Woodmen archetype, though a bit pricy. Woodmen Lore is kinda going against the theme of putting a lot of attachments on a single location.\n\nThe Westfold lancer is 2 Willpower for 3 cost in Tactics so quite good and its effect can be sometimes useful. Possibly a good card.\n\nThe Misty Mountain Journeyman is a good counterpart of the Northern Bowman from last pack, with both being quite at home in the usual Dunedain decks. Strange shenanings aside it might very well be the new Dunedain Pathfinder as cheap willpower for the Dunedain.\n\nKnowledge of the Enemy is some much needed resource acceleration for Dunedain decks, but in general useful for those combat decks that tend to engage a lot of enemies for a Fellowship.\n\nThe Tireless Thoroughbred seems a bit overpriced (both as cost and by using a Restricted slot) for what it gives.\n\nShining Shield is the counterpart of the Sword from last back, only for Noble and with a larger effect when over 40 threat. Might be very good for Denethor and Boromir in Pillar of Kings Gondor Swarm decks (especially in combination with a Gondorian Shield) but there a lot of good target.\n\nThorongil can be really interesting, though I am not yet sure if the \"gain\" part of the text is meant as \"in addition\" or \"substitution\". If for example I can have a Lore/Tactics Aragorn which has the Warrior trait and both the -1 Defense and engagement ability of the Tactics version in addition to the lowering threat ability of the Lore version.\n\nA Desperate Path can be awesome with encounter deck scrying and manipulation (or in the right quest knowing which treacheries are in the encounter deck), otherwise is too much of a gamble for my tastes. But when it hits it's surely spectacular.\n\nÂ "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308538-the-fortress-of-nurn-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3941798","commentId":3941798,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1589966505,"content":"Not sure to have understood how the contract works. 10 cards per each sphere makes 40.

In many decks the Envoy of Pelargir is a good resource smoother so that's another possibility. Ally Treebeard is one of the best ally around.

I first thought it was a monk looking dude, but upon closer inspection it appears to be a woman. I really dislike that haircut too. Very not fitting in the theme of lotr lcg.\n\nSecondly, Aragorns art. I too was a little shocked at the poor art. But looking at the artist I was even more surprised. Alexander Karez is currently (since Magali left) my favorite artist for this game. He has done some great pieces including Hirgon and Thalion.

I think if this was released in a different AP or had epic art in this one, people wouldn't be so down on it. I am hoping that a promo or quality alter pops up on the market at some point for sure.\n\nThe contract seems pretty interesting/Strong, albeit with obvious drawbacks but also a lot of possibilities. Not only does your board state start off stronger but you are getting more mana(admittedly not color matching mana) so you can churn out a lot of board presence easily, either small and cheap allys or using cards like a good harvest to boost out bigger guys. Also anything that benefits from multiple things that share types etc. is great here, not to mention valor action decks.Â \n\nHaleth seems awesome- as good as the master of the forge is, I think I might like a beefier version of him with some relevant types/stats- Also a veryÂ intriguing choice for messenger of kings\n\nWestfold Lancer isn't that good in general, but with Theodens discount, and more importantly Lothriel cheating him in, he is quite strong IMO\n\nMisty mountain Journeyman is really solid for relevant decks\n\nThorongil has a lot of possibilities that I haven't considered once you factor in messenger of kings, but immediately loreagorn and Eowyn stand out as powerful targets. I think one of the more interesting ways of playing this will be to have multiple heroes that could benefit from it, thus having it be a toolbox of sorts, for example if you draw it on the cusp of threating out, get loreagorn to save you, if you get it early on, put it on Arwen, if you are fighting a tough enemy put it on Eowyn, etc.- I'd bet there are far more interesting uses but those blunt ones come to mind.\n\nNot sure I like tireless thoroughbred but there are a lot of warrior characters in the game. This is probably the dud of the set for me, but perhaps I am undervaluing how nice it will be to have in four player games where those keywords value is higher.\n\nShining shield isn't flashy, but I like it. Dunedain Warning is an incredible card, and while this is obviously more narrow, it has the upside of having the ability to be twice as potent. Its niche, but not bad by any means.\n\nKnowledge of the enemy is a bit weird since you can only use it during the planning phase, but it has an insane ceiling and could be quite interesting in Dunedain decks and the like.Â \n\nWoodman lore is not something I expected, but I dig it. It will often be 1 mana to untapped your board, more or less, and its even more appealing with Haleth being added to the game. Perhaps I am overvaluing it from how powerful other mass-readying cards can be\n\nA desperate path is insanely powerful, but obviously a double edged sword. It really comes down to how devastating the encounters treacheries are. For example it would be totally not viable vs. battle of Carin dum, but in some cases keeping a board combat ready and getting a boost to quest will far outweigh the average treachery. I like that, by design, its an \"oh crap\" button, which might sometimes be worth pressing even vs. harsh encounter decks if you're on a turn you'll lose anyways.Â \n\nÂ \n\nAll in all its a good and exciting pack, but naturally I too would prefer seeing more, which I hope we get when the LOTR amazon series airs and they have the sense to ride the hype wave.

However, I would say that if it was moved from one character to another, it goes from unattached to attached. Using some intermediate value theorem logic, I would have to assume that's an attachment process.

The restriction on thorongil does not suggest that you have to play it in order to trigger it's ability. If it did, you could not trigger it with vilya or thrors ring.

If you compare him to Argalad you're on the wrong track. I would argue he is a superior Coragorn.\n\nÂ \n\nArgalad is a lore hero that can quest using his attack power, but only under the condition that an enemy was revealed/is in the staging area. And he then deals 1 damage to that enemy. But if no enemy shows up Argalad is just sitting there and if an enemy does show up, you might need his attack power more. Therefore he really needs direct damage support to truly shine.\n\nÂ \n\nCoragorn is a leadership hero that you can spend 1 resource on, to send him on the quest without exhausting. His main role is attacker/defender but by spending 1 resource you can get 2 more willpower this turn. That is an ok ability. However if you do not reveal an enemy then your resource was jsut spend for ensurance. Coragorns weakness is that you have to decide before the reveal.\n\nÂ \n\nSparagorn has this last part as innate ability. You can simply reveal the encounter card and then decide if you want to use him for willpower or combat. If you reveal a location you use his ability, if you reveal an enemy you keep him ready. That is very powerful in the first 2 turns of the game. Coragorn can of course do both if you pay a resource, butÂ the Sparagorn player can pay for unexpected courage with the same resource cost as 2 activations and blow Coragorn out of the water. Sparagorn with UC can double questÂ (send him to the quest, ready him, reduce threat of location) or quest and combat or double combat. This makes him increadibly flexible with only 1 in-sphere card. Better yet, every Willpower enhancer on him is twice as effective because you can use his willpower twice a turn, making cards like silver circlet 4 WP for 2 resources. And that's ignoring the 1 progress token bonus.\n\nÂ \n\nHis flexibility makes him a great target for crazy combo's too. Sparagorn + Unexpected Courage + Silver Circlet + Idraen + Spare hood and cloakÂ + Northern trackers/Rhovanion outriders. Quest with everybody, ready Sparagorn, have him clear a location in the staging area, trigger Idraen to ready, have her give the cloak to ready Sparagorn, clear the active location, ready Idraen again and you end up with two competent fighters for the combat phase.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308538-the-fortress-of-nurn-player-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3955592","commentId":3955592,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1593115957,"content":"I gotta say your pitch for sparagorn is probably the best I've seen, but I am not convinced he is so great out the gate.

The strength of coragorn is that he does not need any help -- he has two actions each round (commit to the quest + attack/defend) for the cost of one resource. Everything you add to him just further strengthens his out the gate ability (celebrian stone makes questing stronger, courage removes the cost to ready, theodred essentially pays for aragorn, etc). You will always have questing and almost always have combat. The question becomes whether or not you want to spend the money to have him ready for combat. No enemies? Perhaps it's risky. One or more? Spend it.\n\nNow with sparagorn, the option becomes: commit to the quest for guaranteed questing, or hope that a location pops so that you can possibly lay one progress down (if WP >= threat). Of course, if there is a location already in staging, sure, for the cost of exhausting a hero, \"quest\" and MAYBE get a progress. Again. That depends on whether or not you have 1) a 2 or less threat location 2) you have some juice to his will power.
