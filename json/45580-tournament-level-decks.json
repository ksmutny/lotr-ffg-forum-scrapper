At least not any time soon.\n\n \n\nHowever for the purposes of casual play you can probably do whatever you want. If you just combine the decks the game will probably be more random because you could get 4 Hill Trolls early on or get nothing but weaklings the entire game. The standard decks are probably make with a certain distribution to make them a certain difficulty and adding or changing cards will change that. However feel free to add in a couple of extra Hill Trolls if you are feeling the game is too easy. lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45580-tournament-level-decks/?do=findComment&comment=457260","commentId":457260,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1303409269,"content":"Are there any already written rules on how tournaments will work?

I'll be curious to see how viable 50 card decks are. They certainly make the game more difficult at this very moment."}]}
