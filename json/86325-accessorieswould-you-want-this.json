Art book. not a new suggestion but as the art collection gets bigger and often better, its something i want more and more\n\n \n\n2. Game/Deck journal. like the campaign log we get in the insert only more like a 'gaming journal' you could use to write deck ideas down in, write deck and game reports, and keep scores in writing. the idea would be to make it a nicely designed book (though hopefully not leatherbound becuase i won't be able to use it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )\n\n \n\n3. Game mats. Different selections of art from the game. again not new.\n\n \n\n4. Deck boxes. as above.\n\n \n\n5. More art sleeves. i have all the limited ones (gimli, gandalf, daughter of the nimrodel, nazgul on fell beast), i dont sleeve all my cards at once but more would be nice to collect for different decks.\n\n \n\n6. tokens bag. like this only with lotr design\n\n \n\nFFS43.jpg [http://store.fantasyflightgames.com/client/Products/ProdimageLg/FFS43.jpg]\n\n \n\npost yours!\n\nrich\n\nEdited July

and you can go without a gamin mat, but for those wanting something extra, it would be nice to have something official from ffg to compliment the game\n\nEdited July 14, 2013 by
