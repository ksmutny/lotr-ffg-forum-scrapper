That's a lot of allies having to sit on the substitute bench, IMO.

Your comment seemed to imply you could play two at a time.\n\nAlso, my comments were mostly from a 1 player perspective.\n\nI don't see how Resourceful is going to combo much in a single hero deck paired with a Miner deck. The Miner deck needs his partner to run card draw (Bilbo or Beravor) as he can't just hope to always draw his combo. Getting 3 Miners in play by turn 2 without access to major draw is a fluke more than a reliable strategy. Also, the Miner deck needs some Spirit heroes to play the miner (idealy, 2 of them to ensure a first turn Miner). And he still needs to play the game. All that to say, I don't see this card making the Zigil Miner paired decks any stronger than they currently are. I'd much rather run two 3 heroes deck than try forcing secrecy for one of the two.\n\nAnd I totally second Radiskull's take on power creep. I still believe this game will inevitably face the issue, but the rate at which we get player cards (as opposed to other card games where all cards are player cards) is playing for us in delaying the inevitable.

So lets try not to get off topic about steward vs this new card.\n\n \n\nThis is funny. You claim this card shows power creep, but yet, when people are proving that you are wrong, you tell them do not go off topic.\n\nLet's reiterate. In 3 heroes decks this card costs 4. Do not tell that you lower your threat so you can play it cheaper as this is not a strategy (you need multiple cards to pull it off, and usually the pressure from encounter deck means that you deal with current threat nows, so you don't have multiple turns to just lower threat). So when this card costs 4, let's compare it to Steward:\n\n- Steward comes into play and your net resources are already 0. During the second turn, you gain 2 total, during sixth turn you gained 10 resources already.\n\n- Resourceful comes into play and your net resources are already -4. During the second turn, you are at -3. During sixth turn , you are at +1 and this is the point when you start gaining something.\n\nIn this scenario ,Resourceful stands as a weak card , that probably will ruin your game. You are losing a lot of resources in the first  most crucial turns. Steward is great because you do not lose any resources and the gain is almost instant. Frankly, I am not that happy about having resource acceleration that starts working from the sixth turn... Still, we do not have many ways to accelerate resources, so we may try to use this card and see what happens. But this is not a game changer.\n\n \n\nNow let's assume you play secrecy deck. This is where the card shines as it costs just 1. Still, lets compare it to steward.\n\n- Steward works the same as before, but maybe it is little harder to have leadership hero inside\n\n- Resourceful comes into play and you net resources are already -1. During the second turn, you are at 0. During third turn you are at +1 and this is the point when you start gaining something.\n\nIn this scenario, new card gives some more options to secrecy decks. It is not great because you are losing resources at the beginning of the game, but quite quickly it starts to pay off. With the limited amount of resources acceleration, every card like this can be used, especially if they are off color.\n\nBut tell me, where is power creep in such limited card that clearly is not better than previous cards? Where is a power creep, if the new card does NOT replace old cards? (but it just adds some diversity).\n\nAh, I get it now, you do not know what power creep means! Here is a definition for you , taken from MTG wiki:\n\n\"For example, compare Pearled Unicorn with Ronom Unicorn (create). Both have the same power, toughness, color, and creature type. The newer Ronom Unicorn, however, costs 1 less mana and has an effect, making it superior to Pearled Unicorn in almost every way.\"\n\nTell us that you see power creep, when they print non unique, or cheaper steward of gondor."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612824","commentId":612824,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1333419094,"content":"What I mean by going of topic is that these conclusion imo are completely backward..

This is a no brainier. Saying it doesn't work in a deck not designed to use it doesn't mean anything. That is like me saying if I put vassal of the wind lord in a 3 spirit hero deck it is suddenly a useless card.. it is not useless or bad, your deck building is. So yeah.. in your scenario is is a weak card.. but then so is steward if you have no songs and no leadership heroes.\n\nThough as stated you can combo it with a ziggy deck, using ziggy to cast it on another players 3 hero deck... as ziggy sorts itself for resources. You can hard cast it for 4 on Turn1 at best. Though as I said in my tests with ziggy it usually starts to cook around T3. So Bilbo should be in the ziggy deck and Beravore should be on the table and ziggy should go first. Now ziggy has weaknesses, being a combo deck .. the combo might not trigger... in witch case the entire deck fails. Though this is SUPER rare due to card draw. I think it has happened to me twice.\n\n\nguciomir said:\n\n \n\nNow let's assume you play secrecy deck. This is where the card shines as it costs just 1. Still, lets compare it to steward.\n\n- Steward works the same as before, but maybe it is little harder to have leadership hero inside\n\n- Resourceful comes into play and you net resources are already -1. During the second turn, you are at 0. During third turn you are at +1 and this is the point when you start gaining something.\n\nIn this scenario, new card gives some more options to secrecy decks. It is not great because you are losing resources at the beginning of the game, but quite quickly it starts to pay off. With the limited amount of resources acceleration, every card like this can be used, especially if they are off color.\n\n \n\n \n\nWell, the card cost 1, and you get 1 back.. so it pays for itself in 1 turn. This synigises with the next time it is drawn. What makes this card better than steward is the vast variety of game situations it can be used for.. you can split your resource gain across heroes.. do not tell me you haven't played a steward and ended up with a billion resource on one hero and none on another meaning steward is in fact a 100% DEAD card... you do not need any allegiance to cast it as it is neutral, and unlike steward, its effect increases. So for 3 cost you get 3 resources, of your choice (by casting on different heroes) this to me is much more powerful. Also you can free slots in your deck to remove parting gifts witch is a lame way of handling the resource build up, though there is the belt now.\n\nI am not saying steward isn't a strong strong card.. I am saying that this card is more versatile, fits in more decks, has a stronger effect in total and cheaper to cast.\n\n \n\n 7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612893","commentId":612893,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1333435460,"content":"booored said:\n\nWell, the card cost 1, and you get 1 back.. so it pays for itself in 1 turn.\n\n\n\nThat's just not true.  The attachment only generates cards during the resource phase, which means it generates no resources the turn you bring it out.  That's quite different from steward which, generates resources the moment it hits the table. \n\nIn addition, I question your definition of' 'versatile'.  If a card only works with secrecy decks, its not a versatile card.  Yes, its great for secrecy, but Steward will see play in a much wider variety of decks.  That's versatility."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612897","commentId":612897,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1333436239,"content":"no versitility is how the card can be used once in a deck, as the versitility yo uare talking about is the deck construction itself.

Assuming you start with the card, you can play it in turn. Here is an evaluation of how you stand several turns down the road at the end of round 6.\n\n\n- Resources: You have only now broken even with resource collection. You may have potentially gained a small advantage I resource distribution, but even in round six, you haven’t gained any resources. And if something destroyed the attachment, you put yourself in a huge hole.\n- Cards: Remember, the card itself is a cost. You had to lose a card in hand for the privilege of not gaining any net resources. So, even six turns into the game, you have less overall assets than if you had never played the card.\n- Opportunity Cost: This is the big one. You need to evaluate what you lost in not playing a different card on turn two. How many progress tokens have you lost because you didn’t play Faramir? Even a generic 2 willpower ally would probably net you 8-10 resources over this span. How many locations are still in play bogging you down because you didn’t play Northern Tracker? What could you have done with five additional actions (not to mention two resources) if you had played Unexpected Courage? You have dug a gigantic hole for yourself with no actual benefit.   Even in the next several turns when you start to net resources, you will not escape the cost of not having played a permanent asset earlier in the game.\n\n\nWithout secrecy, I don’t think Resourcefulness is a playable card.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62595-new-preview-out/?do=findComment&comment=612907","commentId":612907,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1333438252,"content":"booored said:\n\nno versitility is how the card can be used once in a deck, as the versitility yo uare talking about is the deck construction itself.

Which part of it did you and Booored not get?\n\n(Note: all these comments are based on playing Resourcefullness at its full 4 resource cost - nobody is arguing that the card is great with the secrecy discount).\n\nThe fact that resourcefullness can be spread over multiple heroes is not \"flexibility\". You need multiple copies of it in order to do that. It's not like the Dunedain attachment that can really move from one hero to another. Given the choice between playing a single Resourcefullness on a hero versus playing Steward of Gondor on that same hero, who would pick Resourcefulness?\n\nEven that potential triple-play makes absolutely no sense.

You are left with 2 \"duplicate\" Steward of Gondor in your hand and have 3 resources available. With Resourcefulness, you play nothing (3 Resourcefullness in hand), so you have the same 3 resources available (advantage SoG).\n\nTurn 2 - The SoG guys generates 5 resources. Total count: 8 resources. Resourcefullness plays his first copies. He's down to 2 resources with 2 copies left in hand (at this point, both players have 1 attachment in play and 2 unused cards in hand, but one of them - guess which one - has 8 resources versus 2 resources for the other).\n\nTurn 3 - SoG is now up to 13 resources. Resourcefulness plays his second copy. He's still down to 2 free resources (advantage SoG).\n\nTurn 4 - SoG is up to 18 resources. Resourceful finaly manages to play his 3rd copy. He has 3 resources left.\n\nTurn 5 - From this point on, each turn, the SoG player generates 5 resources while the Res player generates 6. It'll take the resource player 18 turns to catch up with the extra supply generated by Steward of Gondor.\n\nCan it be any clearer that there's no way, at a cost of 4 resources, that this card is better or even close to being as good as Steward of Gondor? I'm not even going into the fact that the Steward guy would have had a huge army of allies in play from his 18 resources by Turn 4 while the other player is stuck with his heroes, 3 attachments and a Wandering Took at the same point in the game...\n\nSeriously!\n\nAnd as for extra SoG being useless because of its unique status, they can still be pitched for Eowyn or Protector of Lorien. That's still a better use of your cards than playing 2 additional copies of Resourcefulness...\n\nAs for this card being the difference between a Northern Tracker and a Lorien Guide, you are again so wrong... You could just play a Northern Tracker instead of Resourcefullness and still have the means to afford a Lorien Guide the next turn!\n\nAnd as for scenario becoming impossible to beat with a single deck, again, I think you're way off... As player card pool increase, we'll keep getting access to more and more cards. A deck to beat them all will emerge; there are a number of great builds already efficient against \"most\" scenarios.
