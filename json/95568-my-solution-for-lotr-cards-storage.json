Also i try to not replicate a box when somebody ask me to craft one, so it depends from materials painting, drawing and stuff like that, each one of my box is personal and unique, i remember one box in particular for warhammer invasions LCG, with the Bloodthirster paint took me 3 month: 750 euro :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]!!!\n\n \n\nSo in conclusion ive done this box for me, and ive done it bigger than necessary, also if you like one i can do pretty much whatever you guys want, size or painting dosent matter :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nEdited December 23, 2013 by Cricco"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95568-my-solution-for-lotr-cards-storage/?do=findComment&comment=937103","commentId":937103,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1387799369,"content":"That is a pretty amazing piece of work.
