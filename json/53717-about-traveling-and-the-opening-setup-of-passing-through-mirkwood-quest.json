Just purchased this game today after saving a little extra cash the last few weeks and I'm starting the intro quest. My question is this. The 'Passing through Mirkwood' setup has me place the Old Forest Location in the staging area. Is this area considered an already active location and I put my first quest phase progress tokens toward it or do I travel to the location during the first travel phase and put my progress tokens toward the quest? (if no other locations are put in the staging area during the quest phase)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53717-about-traveling-and-the-opening-setup-of-passing-through-mirkwood-quest/?do=findComment&comment=532935","commentId":532935,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1316975470,"content":"No, it starts in the staging area.Â  After you quest you have the option to travel, so you can make it the active location at that point if you like."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53717-about-traveling-and-the-opening-setup-of-passing-through-mirkwood-quest/?do=findComment&comment=532968","commentId":532968,"userName":"A Paperback Hero","timestamp":1316980441,"content":"Thanks for the response. That's exactly how I decided to play it. Just finish the intro and game and I really enjoyed it! Glad I took the risk and also bought some of the expansion packs. (Journey to Rhosgobel and Hunt of Gollum). The local game store didn't have Conflict at Carrock, but I will order it online soon!"}]}
