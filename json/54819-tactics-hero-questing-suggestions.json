BUT the current situtation where they are SO limited is a real pain. This kind of thing seems ideal: options to make their questing viable/gain a short-term boost, but with serious drawbacks/downsides, to stop them just getting 'better'\n\nnot sure about teh actual numbers- would probably need a fair bit of play-testing to get balanced."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54819-tactics-hero-questing-suggestions/?do=findComment&comment=542774","commentId":542774,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1318774164,"content":"Dwnhmcntryboy said:\n\n...Tactics should have stupid stuff to help them Quest...: \n\n\n\nI think your card ideas were cool and that cards that helped Tactics characters quest should be temporary (for the phase/round).  I don't think these cards would be stupid, but useful. Choice of words?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54819-tactics-hero-questing-suggestions/?do=findComment&comment=542870","commentId":542870,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1318787734,"content":"I believe that the uniqueness of the different spheres will further diminish with future cards. The forerunner here is Spirit (card drawing/Ancient Mathom and resource generation/Zigil Miner in Khazad-Dum) that can do everything except heavy fighting. Tactics will eventually receive questing/willpower support cards and not even necessarily with drawbacks suggested by the OP. Maybe they will be one-use cards or tied to exhausting chars/heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54819-tactics-hero-questing-suggestions/?do=findComment&comment=544362","commentId":544362,"userName":"Dwnhmcntryboy","timestamp":1319036531,"content":" I agree with not overpowering the Tactics sphere's questing ability. There should be sacrifice for them to quest."}]}
