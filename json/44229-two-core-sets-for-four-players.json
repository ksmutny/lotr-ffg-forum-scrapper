The more different cards there are the more possibilities you have to customize stuff. I enjoy using semi-random decks, i.e. there's a core of about 36 cards (12x3) that are fixed and have been carefully selected to work well together. Then I add 14 random cards (of the same factions used in the fixed deck). This creates decks that work pretty well but still have this fun surprise factor that can force you to come up with new combos or just play cards you'd otherwise never use.\n\nI think this should work marvelously with encounter decks: Use a fixed base (i.e. the standard encounter deck) then add a bunch of random cards from the other APs.
