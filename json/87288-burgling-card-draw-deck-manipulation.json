The first revealed card remains the \"revealed card\" unless you use the effect on The Lonely Mountain. In order to use the effect on The Lonely Mountain you must take the revealed card into your hand.\n------------------------------\n\n \n\nBrief reply, leaves me with some questions.  If we take it at its word though, it simply means that the revealed card is the revealed card, no matter what happens to it (excepting use of the Lonely Mountain action).  Makes me wonder though!  If I end up shuffling that card into the deck via The Eagles Are Coming!, or discarding it via Eowyn or whatever effect, it sounds like a legal play to use the Lonely Mountain to search your deck for that card and take it into your hand, or to move it from the discard pile into your hand.  I asked those questions specifically when I submitted the rules question, and got the reply above... not directly addressed, so I'll take them as legal plays.  Not game breaking by any means, just weird!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87288-burgling-card-draw-deck-manipulation/?do=findComment&comment=1809798","commentId":1809798,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1442850716,"content":"I don't think it is game breaking either, but that is really interesting.  So the revealed card could be something useless.  You trigger Imladris, rearrange your deck so it is the 5th card instead of the top and order the other 4 cards in a way that is advantageous for the search.  Now, you can trigger the Lonely Mountain action and take the \"useless\" card into your hand (even though it is 5 cards deep) and reveal the new top card which you placed there with Imladris.  Seems strong.\n\n \n\nAlthough, would taking the card into your hand count as searching your deck which would require a reshuffle?  It would be easy to find the card without looking at the rest of your deck in the case of Imladris, but in examples where you have to shuffle your entire deck, you could not know where the card went to...\n\nEdited September 21, 2015 by cmabr002"}]}
