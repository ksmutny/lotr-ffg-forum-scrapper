It seems like the Lord of Morthond is an ongoing effect, that requires each hero to have printed leadership icon, which is different then playing Burning Brand on Gandalf which only requires him to have lore when it is played.\n\nEdited August 22, 2014 by Tracker1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114367-gandalf-lord-of-morthond/?do=findComment&comment=1218686","commentId":1218686,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1408703064,"content":"We can speculate on it all day long, but I think I'll just email Caleb this question to make it easier for all of us."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114367-gandalf-lord-of-morthond/?do=findComment&comment=1218790","commentId":1218790,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1408708839,"content":"There is one big thing telling me \"no\".

This would allow you to play cards like Strength of Arms from the top of your deck. However, Gandalf’s ability is only active while you are playing that card. As soon as that card is played he reverts to neutral status.

He gains all four resource icons when playing the card, so he would have Leadership whilst the ally was played.\n\n \n\nOn a side note, does anyone else think the wording on Gandalf is slightly odd? Why do they give him all four icons when, with the current pool, he wouldn't benefit from any other than the sphere of the card being played. I can only think that they didn't want Gandalf paying for Baggins or Fellowship cards, and this was the most concise wording they could come up with. EDIT: Or there's some non-spoiled card for The Road Darkens that makes use of it.\n\nEdited August 23, 2014 by blinky"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114367-gandalf-lord-of-morthond/?do=findComment&comment=1220844","commentId":1220844,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1408799686,"content":">  \n> \n> > Good to know, thanks. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > Presumably the same ruling would apply to Knight of Minas Tirith [http://www.hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Knight-of-Minas-Tirith-AoO] as well.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I think you might be able to use the Knights of Minas Tirith Response.\n> \n> It's a question of when the card (Knights) gains it's response, and when it loses it - the implication is that if you have three tactics heroes it gains this response all the time, however the response is only one use (unlike Lord of Morthond). \n> \n> So Lord of Mothrond does gain it's response as you play it with Gandalf, but by the time you would ever use it it's gone again.
