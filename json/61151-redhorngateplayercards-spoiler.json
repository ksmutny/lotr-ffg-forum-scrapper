Quite cool! Hard quest but there is some trick to make it more easy. Anyway enemies there really powerful beasts. Snow wargs is really nasty and Mountain wargs more powerful then other wargs from core set.\n\nSome tips:\n\nYou must try explored Caradras on the staging area before you come to third quest card. Otherwise you will lose many characters and questing will be really difficult. Arwen really helps you a lot but on the last stage you can lose her easy cose Caradras make every questing characters -1 will power and quest card say: discard all characters with 0 will power. Every time thanks to frozen cold i lose 1 hero on the last stage.\n\nQuest is really different to all other previous quests before, quite hard, interesting as well.\n\nCongratulation FFG good job!!!

There is no restriction on moving C out of your victory display to fulfil 2B's Forced, which doesn't say anything about moving C from the staging area to become the active location, just that C becomes the active location.

Looks like we need some special rule about cards in Victory display."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61151-redhorngateplayercards-spoiler/?do=findComment&comment=604195","commentId":604195,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1331345111,"content":"Finally, Redhorn Gate is due to be delivered in the UK 13th March.
