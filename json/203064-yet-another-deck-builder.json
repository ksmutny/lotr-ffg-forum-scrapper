I find it greatly speeds up my deckbuilding as I only ever have to search for 2 or 3 cards. FYI, if you choose any hero, it will give a suggestion. So you could just pick a hero first and hide the suggestions right from the start. Alternatively, if you are a little tech savvy, you could just download a previous version of the deckbuilder from github and run it locally on your computer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/203064-yet-another-deck-builder/?do=findComment&comment=2061243","commentId":2061243,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1455895694,"content":">  \n> \n> Hi\n>  \n> I'm considering creating another deck builder for this great game.
