The latest expansions and packs overshadow earlier releases by a VERY good margin (imho some of the best adventures in the game). Their approach to players specifically is a marked improvement over late Dwarrowdelf/HoN design (more well rounded cards, less cheese and must-includes).\n\n \n\nTrouble in Tharbant and the 3 trials are evidence of this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125515-how-much-is-this-game-improved-past-the-box-set/?do=findComment&comment=1308599","commentId":1308599,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1414023269,"content":"Yeah the game only gets better with every new quest and player card released.

And I love Into Ithilien. Yes it is hard and everything people have already said about it in the past, but it introduced Southrons to the game. And you can win quest either just through fighting or sneaking through the forest. It totally your choice. Sneaking through the forest is harder, yes, but that's how it should be.\n\n \n\nSiege of Cair Andros is awesomely desgined quest. The choice between which locations to save is great. And depending on what you save, game will unfold differently. I have yet to win it, but I never felt frustrated by it. \n\n \n\nWhole expansion is mostly combat oriented, that's for sure.\n\n \n\nAnd let's be honest. I believe that quite a lot of players got so frustrated by the quests that they marked this expansions as \"badly designed\" or as one of the downs of the game. Far, far from this. And I do not consider myself as that great of a player and deck-builder.\n\n \n\nI recommend Heirs of Numenor wholeheartedly.\n\n \n\nOh and one more thing. I bought this expansion after I got only the Core Set and Mirkwood Cycle, so you do not really need Khazad Dum and DD Cycle. It makes things easier, that's true.\n\nEagles all the way baby! \n\nEdited October 23, 2014 by Eldainorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125515-how-much-is-this-game-improved-past-the-box-set/?do=findComment&comment=1309358","commentId":1309358,"userName":"OMZA","timestamp":1414083362,"content":"The problem in CairAndros is that you have to face enemy cards that represent a whole unit or squad, with an unbeliveable ton on attack/def stats, which represents that they attack together the same poor errand rider (chose any chumpblocker here) and block together, like a roman militia, against your attacks.
