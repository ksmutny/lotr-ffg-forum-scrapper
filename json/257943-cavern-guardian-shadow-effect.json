Discarded objective cards are returned to the staging area. (If this attack is undefended, discard all attachments you control.)\n\nIs it correct to discard an attachment in my hand? , I don't understand if the effect refers exclusively to the attachments that have been already played.\n\nRegards,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/257943-cavern-guardian-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=2967539","commentId":2967539,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1504502949,"content":"You have to discard one that is in play.  You only \"control\" a card if it's in play.  The core set manual is very sloppy about explaining this, but that's how it is -- you \"own\" cards in your hand, but you don't \"control\" them. "}]}
