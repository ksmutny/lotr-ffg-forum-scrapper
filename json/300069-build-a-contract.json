But because we often run decks with multiple copies of a card, it might be hard to find the one card we need to make our decks work. I figure the extra card draw might come in handy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300069-build-a-contract/?do=findComment&comment=3785785","commentId":3785785,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1568570406,"content":"That's a great idea!

But what do you mean with discarding cards from play? 8 playercards in the discard pile? Or do encounter cards count?\n\nGeneral Grievous ideas are neat, but partially overpowered. The Dunedain contract buffes a Dunedain trap deck by insane amounts. Also 5 threat reduction PER ROUND for the hobbit contract? Insanity!\nForces of Good seems interresting as usually at least one hero or ally you would like to have doesn't fit the requirement. Reward seems fair (might even be underpowered)\n\n2-hero support is awesome. Also having the contract as more of a backup in case of a hero death is fitting, but don't scale the buff of the ones digit of the threat. Just by going from 29 to 30 you loose so much power. Or you get power by going down in threat. Just seems to swingy. I'd reduce (or remove) the healing on the first side and add i to the second one (ofc only at the start/end of the round, not every phase). Also keep the buff scaling of the tens digit. If you want to give the remaing hero more power have all or a part of the slain heroes added to him (as in add e.g. the slain heroes willpower to the remaing heroes willpower).\n\n \n\nI'd like a contract to support high starting threat (something i feel isn't really there aside from some valor effects as starting high reall is more of a burden, even with the higher stats heroes):\n\nSide A:\nYour starting threat must be 33 or higher (I went with 33 so you are at least at 30 when going with tactics Eowyn)\nIf your threat is below 33 treat this textbox as empty (I would have made it that you can't reduce is below but stuff like trouble in tharbad would be a problem).\nAt the beginning of the engagement phase choose an non-unique enemy, then choose one: This enemy engages you or this enemy doesn't make engagement checks this phase.\nFlip this card over, if your threat is ever 40 or higher.\n\nSide B:\nYour threat can only be increased or lowered by one at a time (interaction with favor of the valar up to discussion :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]).\nYou may, additionally, optionally engage one non unique enemy engaged with another player per teammate during the engagement phase (so up to 3 optional enemies, each from another palyer, + the one from the staging area).\n\nWithout playing it, I am not sure the idea is balanced or even fun. You have impact in a multiplaer game by stopping one enemy noone can deal with right now or get more enemies to you and protecting your allies this way as you probably would have to fight a lot anyway. Side B doubles down on this idea. The side doesn't offer great benefits to solo play aside from being able to skip questing without to much punishment."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300069-build-a-contract/?do=findComment&comment=3785846","commentId":3785846,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1568580309,"content":"> 43 minutes ago, Calvadur said:\n> \n> Supporting a highlander deck is a neat idea.

Considering you are probably going with two courages, or even a double circlet, you are pretty OP out the gate.

Your starting heroes get +2 until the end of the round. \n\nIn WP, you get essentially a cirdan/eowyn level of questing boost. But a +4 pooled attack is given only with Beorn. And two sets of +2 defenses even on average heroes suddenly gives you a pair of tanks.\n\nIt is in the versatility of this effect that makes it appealing. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300069-build-a-contract/?do=findComment&comment=3997659","commentId":3997659,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1601864329,"content":"That could work as well, I was just going with the number 2 theme.
