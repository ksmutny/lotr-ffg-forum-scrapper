I will not wait eagerly for the new cycle while finishing playing the PODs I was missing.\n\nI have also a some supplemental materials (almost all the Player Mats, a few promo hero cards) and I still don't own (and I don't think I ever will) the Limited Collector's Edition, but I think this is a great achievment for me and my limited resources so I will go and enjoy a few games to celebrate (**** you Attack on Dol Guldur I will beat you this time...)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297360-finally-completed/?do=findComment&comment=3737854","commentId":3737854,"userName":"Pericles","timestamp":1562858979,"content":"Congrats!

I \"finished\" my set this year as well. I don't have any nightmare, and only the Saga/Laketown POD's, but to me that is finished. I found this card game around 2013 randomly searching for information on the older 1990s MECCG card set (I think I may have also saw a Core set at Barnes & Noble). At first I started with the Core, Hobbit and LotR Saga sets (that were available at the time), but once I found ringsDB I realized there were a ton of cards I needed to make any of the decks listed on the site. So over the last few years (2017 - 2019), I was constantly buying sets off Amazon and eBay when I could get them for under retail. I found a local shop or two that tried carrying some of the early sets, but all the local shops in my area (Northern Nevada) either closed down in the last 5 years or just don't carry LotR LCG. Now I am driving myself nuts waiting for the pre-orders of the current set to ship."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297360-finally-completed/?do=findComment&comment=3819394","commentId":3819394,"userName":"TheSpitfired","timestamp":1572561110,"content":"Congratulations!
