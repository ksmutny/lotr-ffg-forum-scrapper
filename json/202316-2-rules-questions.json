The first question is about multiple defenders, it is so long since I had used them but I was thinking about the new Anchor Watch card. When you have multiple defenders of an attack, thanks to Stand Together, Dori or the above, and the attack strength is higher than the defense, how do you deal damage? Do you have to apply it all to one character? And can you overkill it?\n\n \n\nThe second is with Hands Upon the Bow and Quick Strike against immune to player cards enemies. If I remember correctly, the former is not allowed whilst the latter is, but I am not sure, and am not sure if I see why, the wording seems almost the exact same.\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202316-2-rules-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2048133","commentId":2048133,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1455268352,"content":"Damage is applied to a single character when using multiple defenders, you can't spread it around."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202316-2-rules-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2048180","commentId":2048180,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1455270984,"content":"Ok, thanks, I thought so.

Quick strike only ever targets one of your characters so in effect you aren't actually targeting the enemy, your character's attack is.\n\n \n\nHope that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202316-2-rules-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2048283","commentId":2048283,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1455279312,"content":"Ok, that was the thing, I remembered right.

Yes, if youhave multiple defenders only one will take the damage even if it's Overkill \n\n \n\n2. I fear Davachido is wrong, both, \"Hands upon the bow\" and \"Quick Strike\" target your own character and allow them to make an attack against an enemie (and immune to Player Card effects doesn't prevent getting attacked):\n\n \n\nhttp://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/quick-strike-core [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/quick-strike-core]\n\n\n\nhttp://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/shadow-and-flame/hands-upon-the-bow-saf [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/shadow-and-flame/hands-upon-the-bow-saf]\n\n \n\nThis would also fit with the Report in the cardgamedb rules clarification threat (page 4, right at the top):\n\n\n\nhttp://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications/page-4 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications/page-4]\n\n \n\nCaleb says, that you can attack Bolg, who is immune to Player Card effects, with \"Hands upon the bow\"\n\n \n\nEdit: My 2nd point is wrong, the ruling I refer to is outdated (see next post by GrandSpleen)\n\nEdited February 12, 2016 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202316-2-rules-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2048454","commentId":2048454,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1455287158,"content":"That ruling about Bolg and Hands Upon the Bow was reversed soon after it was given, around the time when the FAQ was updated to include extra information about \"immune\" enemies.  \n\n \n\nFrom that FAQ:\n\n\"For example: Hands Upon the Bow (D 131) cannot be used to attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects, because it clearly indicates that the player must pick an enemy in the staging area to attack.

Basically something about QS makes an attack target an eligible enemy which means that the card is only targeting a character to allow them to attack out of the attack phase.\n\n \n\nWhereas hand upon the bow allows you to circumvent normal attack rules for targeting, similar to Dunhere, by targeting that enemy with the ability on the card. At least that's what the officially ruling goes anyway."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202316-2-rules-questions/?do=findComment&comment=2049195","commentId":2049195,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1455305483,"content":"> That ruling about Bolg and Hands Upon the Bow was reversed soon after it was given, around the time when the FAQ was updated to include extra information about \"immune\" enemies.  \n> \n>  \n> \n> From that FAQ:\n> \n> \"For example: Hands Upon the Bow (D 131) cannot be used to attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects, because it clearly indicates that the player must pick an enemy in the staging area to attack.
