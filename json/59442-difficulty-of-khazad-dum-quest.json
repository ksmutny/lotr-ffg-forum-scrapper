I won't give away the strategy, but once you see it you'll kick yourself for why you didn't see it earlier.\n\nI haven't tried the last scenario yet...but I suspect it will be quite difficult solo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59442-difficulty-of-khazad-dum-quest/?do=findComment&comment=585500","commentId":585500,"userName":"Basuh","timestamp":1327640175,"content":"bifur/bilbo(lore) for support and dwarfs (eowyn) for spiritsupport/questing/rohan and zigil and leadership gloin or dain or theodred( could be the rohan-staging-attacker) for stweard of gondor and balins song and more carddraw.\n\nits just too easy to run straight trough the quest cause you can draw cards like hell and a impressive mass of willpower and threatmanipulation....\n\nwith my setup i start with 25 threat and get so much money and cards for pump everything out too fast.\n\n \n\ni dont like not playing existing cards, cause its not MY job to balance the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59442-difficulty-of-khazad-dum-quest/?do=findComment&comment=585509","commentId":585509,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1327641887,"content":"So far only have beaten the first quest in 3rd or 4th attempt due to lack of time ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n2 players: We first tried to choose Dwarves only for heroes. My wife played Leadership/Spirit and I played Tacitcs/Lore with all the Eagles in my deck. We failed 2 times, until we swapped the Spirit Dwarf (Bifur?) for Eowen, and won .
