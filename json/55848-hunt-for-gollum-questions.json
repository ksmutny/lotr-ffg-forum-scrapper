So you can claim the Signs (since it's a Response), then you add the progress tokens, reach stage 3B and don't have to reset. Probably only to then draw Hunters from Mordor as Shadow Effect or something and still reset lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif].\n\n#2: Yes, once it becomes unguarded, it remains so, unless it hits the discard pile and comes back (Athelas via Forest Grove) or gets shuffled back into the Encounter deck and comes back (False Lead for Signs in HFG)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55848-hunt-for-gollum-questions/?do=findComment&comment=552235","commentId":552235,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1320502478,"content":"Ok, that makes sense. So the best strategy would be to keep the unguarded clues in the staging area until I finish the second stage - so that the shadow effect of the Hunters won't effect my heroes?
