I love the synergy of Merry and Pippin with other hobbits (best to use them in a mono-hobbit deck). Sam on the other hand, I really am looking forward to because not only it provides much needed leadership to the hobbit deck, but his ability works in any low-threat deck or even mono-leadership deck. I will definitely be trying him out in all sorts of decks, even if it's just to splash leadership to get steward of Gondor and Sneak attack. His questing power for 3 and low threat are perfect for any deck.\n\n \n\nI may be overestimating a bit, but I think Sam might be the new \"spirit Glorfindel\" but of the leadership sphere. He's only 3 threat more, but has a positive effect rather than the negative threat gain, and the ability I foresee as going off quite a bit, so essentially he comes with a \"Light of Valinor\" pre-attached to him but boosts his attack and defense to a reasonable amount. I don't want to say he will be more powerful than Glorfindel, but maybe with all the hobbit attachments (like the cloak) he might just prove to be better (though I might be biased given that the leadership sphere is my personal favorite giving access to sneak attack and steward).\n\n \n\nDoes anyone else think Sam might prove to play on par or even higher than Glorfindel?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816332","commentId":816332,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374096014,"content":">  \n> \n> Does anyone else think Sam might prove to play on par or even higher than Glorfindel?\n\nthats tough to say- i think, as you point out in your post, it depends on the cards we get specifically for him. one of the main reasons glorfindel is so powerful is the light and asfaloth\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816338","commentId":816338,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1374096449,"content":"Did anyone else think that Merry looked just a tad bit like Pippin in the films?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816369","commentId":816369,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1374098432,"content":"My post just got destroyed (after I wrote it for an hour) so this is more of a summary:\n\n \n\nI'm concerned that getting Pippin will mean we'll get new versions of other fellowship members (particularly Aragorn and Boromir). I don't feel that we \"need\" a new gimli or legolas either. \n\n \n\nI'm concerned about the overall power of these three heroes (although I do really like them at the same time), all three hobbits feel like they get two special abilities (that they don't pay for)\n\nMerlonde gives +3 stats (effectively) as her only ability. Bifur has +1. The elf brothers each get +1 (but only together, separately they actually pay 1). Sam is basically the second best at this role (With only spirit glorfindal being better at +7 - but everyone seems to agree that he's overpowered, and probably the best single hero in the game).\n\n \n\nSam gets +3 stats if you engage something more threatening than you. He also gets a free ready. This means that Sam can quest for the same as Aragorn but doesn't have to spend a resource to ready, he can ready for free if he engages something above the threat cost. He gets to attack or defend at +2 as well as questing for 3. I think Sam is clearly the most powerful hero here (and much more powerful than other \"8\" cost heroes, except for Spirit Glorfindel)\n\n \n\nMerry gets up to +3 stats (in a Saga expansion with a hobbit bonus hero) or more likely +2. He also gets the amazing ability to ready another combat hero. I feel that these two abilities together may be too good - although I do like that one of them is better with hobbits and the other is better without (since letting another hobbit attacker ready to attack again isn't that great). He has good potential as the combat star in a tri-hobbit deck, and as a support in mono-tactics to get for instance, double legolas questing, or Gimli with high damage twice. (Although I think merry might be a bit too good, I really like the design here).\n\n \n\nPippin has obvious synergy with hobbits. (Letting the hobbit theme of engaging high threat enemies work for longer, and on smaller enemies). I think his secondary card draw ability will rarely see play outside of the hobbit theme. Overall I find him quite underwhelming if not taken in the hobbit theme. It's especially a shame because spirit Pippin also only works with all hobbits - which means we now have two hobbit cards that absolutely need other hobbits, and they don't work together. (Merry I think will work even without other hobbits).\n\nOverall I'm excited by the direction of the hobbit theme, but I fear that it's trying to ramp up too quickly to compete with the strong Dwarf theme - and that this could lead to power creep and inbalance with other themes. (See outlands). The smaller themes like hobbit and outlands will already have an advantage in being very focused because of their narrower card pool. Making them too good will sideline other bigger themes (even dwarfs if Hobbits continue to get power like what's shown here).\n\n(Dwarfs are too strong as a theme mainly because they should have been broken up the way elves and men were - but since they weren't initially we're now stuck with that poor design choice - I hope it won't prove to be a problem for power creep and balance in general).\n\nSorry if it isn't clear - but I don't have time to write it all again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816371","commentId":816371,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1374098539,"content":"Not much to add that hasn't been mentioned yet.  Artwork is decent.  Synergies are very nice for the Hobbits!\n\n \n\nI did notice that Sam is really the only one that really doesn't have any built in hobbit-dependant abilities... making him a bit more versatile than the other two.  That combines with his better stats probably justifies the higher threat cost.\n\n \n\nI honestly think the lack of a Spirit sphere amongst them is due to the previous Pippin having that sphere, regardless of who the 4th hero in the set will be.  This way, you can run with Sam, Merry, and either version of Pippin based on whether you prefer to run green cards or blue.\n\n \n\nPersonally, while the Pippin cards are OKAY if you want to create a theme deck, I am looking forward to a Sam, Merry, and Glorfindel (spirit) deck that starts below the Secrecy threshold.  That gives me the blue cards I need to cancel treachery/shadow, to stay under the secrecy level, and the allies for questing.  Sam can bring his secrecy cards to the party.  And Merry pulls in those potent Tactics cards to give them all some bite (Gondorian Shield on Sam to give him 3 defense after questing, potentially 5 with the cloak- for 2 resources total...

I also like the spheres they're in. Sam literlly leads Frodo towards the completion of his task, merry is (with eowyn) the witch-king slayer and pippin is a Took ! The hard part will be choosing which hobbit to use and which one to let out ! And if Fatty is going to be the fourth that's going to be an even harder choice. I'm really looking forward to see what the tactics cards will be like. I also like that each one of these hobbits is perfectly playable in non-hobbit decks. Pippin will still increase enemy's threat cost by 1 and you'll still draw a card if you engage an enemy with a higher threat, plus with mirlonde he's great for monolore secrecy. Same for Merry, a tactics hero with 6 threat and 2 WP (3 with theoden)...pretty welcome...and he has a very cool and thematic ability. Sam is just awsome, he quests for 3 (for only 8 threat in the leadership sphere !) and stands in front of a tough enemy raising all of his stats by one (except for HP which by the way is just awsome and accurate since he's the sturdiest hobbit ever).

I know they're already in the core, but they are such critical members of the fellowship I would be very surprised if they weren't included, besides I suppose we're about due for new versions of them. Boromir on the other hand is an interesting case, he obviously is also very important but it seems kind of odd that he could be our first 3rd version of a hero especially after getting one so soon (although pippin goes against this reasoning). What sphere would he even be? Another tactics?! An argument could be made for lore (albeit not a strong one) and spirit would be a real clash. Instead I may think that we would get an ally version (likely tactics). It has a precident with Gloin, Bifur, and Dwalin from the hobbit boxes so I doesn't seem it would be a huge reach.\n\nPersonally I think the heroes for the next box would be(rounding out the fellowship):\n\nAragorn (we can't NOT get another version of him in these expansions...it's gonna happen), Legolas, Gimli, then the last spot be occupied by any one of the following: Elrond, Haldir (my pipe dream), Celeborn, Galadriel, or Arwen (I'd think she's least likely since her book part is so small despite being an important character)\n\nEdited July 18, 2013 by Pharmboys2013"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816491","commentId":816491,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1374115010,"content":"I dig all of it except for 4 attack on a Hobbit.  Sam looks great.  Surprised at his own wrath, maybe.\n\n \n\nAlso, using Merry to ready Beorn is a patently illegal move, yes?\n\nEdited July 18, 2013 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816500","commentId":816500,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1374115757,"content":"> Also, using Merry to ready Beorn is a patently illegal move, yes?\n\nHe means the ally version of Beorn, and I think it is totally legal."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816507","commentId":816507,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1374116045,"content":"You're right.  I obviously didn't read very carefully.  Thanks for pointing that out!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=816565","commentId":816565,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1374127048,"content":"> I feel really annoyed when I hear people complain about something that others put a lot of work and time into.\n\nI got quite annoyed reading this.

Untap effects are always strong. I expect him to sit very comfortably with either 2 other hobbits for 3attck , maybe 4. Still the real power is when playing with Brand.

Brand untaps target toon for your partner. Merry untaps Brand. Brand and Target Toon attack. Brand again untaps target toon again. So we are lookign at +5 attack minimum each attack from range + the attack value of what ever card you are untapping every time. Some thoughtful optional engagements can max the untap effect based on turn order, but in most cases the untap will be used for the NEXT attack. Still swarms of enemies can now be taken down with ease.\n\n \n\nAlso the sword deck can pull as much has they like and block, not needing to worry about attacking back as you can untap all the cards. This can be done nearly on trun 1 as well. Pretty powerful.\n\n \n\nIf you get some Elf Rope or w/e the **** it is called or UC on Merry this becomes a combo that can untap entire hero lines across the table. It isn't quite infinite but close.. though there are better uses for UC, the elf rope might find a good target in Merry.\n\n \n\nPretty keen to try it when I get a chance.\n\nEdited July 19, 2013 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=817208","commentId":817208,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1374192783,"content":"> I still think that you're right that we'll have at least one of Legolas, Gimli, or Aragorn in the next one.

Guess he is out. I don't think that Bpmbadil has to be that strong. He is very passive/uninterested, so he could be designed in a way that he has some low stats but a great passive ability. or an ability that is triggered when you play a song on Bombadil.

Along with specific items, weapons for them (Anduril, Lothlorien gifts, etc.)\n\n \n\nI know the existing versions of these characters are great, but they are my favourites and I want as many options to play them in different sphere combinations, synergies and circumstances as possible. I personally don't think it's likely, due to a lot of negative buzz concerning this topic in the past. I think we'll get ally or object ally versions of them instead. Like the Hobbit with Thorin's Company, the designers will want the single player to have the option of having the whole fellowship under their control.\n\n \n\nI think this is a big shame. This is the real Lotr now, and I want up-to-date, definitive versions of it's most prominent characters. I think objecting to duplicate characters not only cuts down on the options available for playing with your favourite heroes, it hurts the longevity of the game. There are only a finite amount of characters, and while I very much appreciate seeing lesser characters as Heroes, eventually that is all we'll get. A second Pippin? Strange perhaps, but honestly how could he not be in the black riders set? The three hobbits previewed synergise fantastically together.\n\n \n\nHaving said all that, I think FFG will go the elven route with the second fellowship set. Galadriel, Celeborn, Arwen and Haldir. All new heroes, two new girls (much needed, as inevitably with some stunning art from Magali), and all giving a much needed boost to the much needed and requested Elven synergies. I would prefer this in a parallel Elven cycle, but I don't think it will happen.\n\n \n\nThe Three Hunters in the Treason of Isengard box? I would love it but I think it's unlikely. Rohan synergies and Ents are a certainty, I think.\n\n \n\nAs sad as it seems I think we may be stuck with the core set Legolas and Gimli (as Heroes at least) for some time.\n\n \n\nPs, whoever said the main objective ally after the breaking of the fellowship could be Aragorn, I think that would be an excellent idea. However, I think it more likely to be Gandalf the White (Fangorn onwards, of course). It wouldn't step on the toes of people who want to use the existing Aragorns, and would go part way to giving us an actual Gandalf hero. (A powerful Hero, and one they would never have to worry about breaking the rest of the game.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=817549","commentId":817549,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1374243980,"content":"> My guess is that we won't get a fourth Hobbit hero in BR.

He is very passive/uninterested, so he could be designed in a way that he has some low stats but a great passive ability. or an ability that is triggered when you play a song on Bombadil. Same goes for Goldberry (who could have some healing ability) who I don't think is a stretch. She is more powerful than most of the characters in LotR and she gets more page time than Hirluin. Let's not forget there is a certain lack of female heroes.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nI see the only sensible way in having Bombadil and/or Goldberry in game as a one-time use ally (think Escort from Edoras) or through an attachment or event. They weren't travelling through the Middle-Earth, so I see little sense in having them as a heroes in, say, Siege of Cair Andros, or in Moria. I know that the game stretches the believability sometimes too thin, but why stretch it even more?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86538-new-preview-hobbit-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=817562","commentId":817562,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1374245415,"content":"So, the Spirit hero will also be Hobbit? ****, I hoped for Spirit Aragorn.\n\nWhy?
