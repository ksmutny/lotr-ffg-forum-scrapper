See FAQ p8:\n\n\"Q: When should Feint (CORE 34) be played?\nA: This card should be played any time before \nresolving step 1 of the target enemy’s attack during the \ncombat phase. (Once the act of resolving an enemy’s \nattack begins, it is too late to prevent it from attacking \nwith Feint.)\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125850-2-quick-combat-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1313591","commentId":1313591,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1414447988,"content":"Oh boy.

Sleeping sentry really is the most brutal card ever printed.\n\n \n\nI got the same treachery you posted right after entering quest phase 2 so I only got 2 orcs back from the discard pile. Just brutal. I dont even remember coming across this card in regular RtR, which goes to show what an improvement NM is (and how well designed too).\n\n \n\nHowever I have also enjoyed my time with NM a lot. It takes real strategy and carefulness to make it through. You both need to know the encounter deck's tricks and fine tune your deck, making you a better player. Ive already improved my deck by removing Saruman for 3 dunedain watchers and took less resource generation for some extra card draw. Hopefully I wont have to switch to Outlands/Gandalf hero to make it through.\n\n \n\nNM RtR has my ideal \"hard\" difficulty. Here's another question, what other NM quests are at the same level? I like tough but not ram-your-head against-the-wall hard (I just end up frustrated and feeling dumb :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]). Im thinking about picking up NM PtM next."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125850-2-quick-combat-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1314035","commentId":1314035,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1414493973,"content":"I found the first two of the Khazad Dum Nightmare quests (into the pit and seventh level) are both of a similar difficulty level and so is The Redhorn Gate (except for Snow Giant.... brutal card...). The Long Dark and Watcher in the Water nightmare are slightly harder but not too crazy. Passage through Mirkwood is also about the same yep and Journey Down the Anduin is also not too crazy (except for Gladden Fields with 10 Threat).\n\n \n\nOrc Ambush actually is in the normal encounter set for Return to Rivendell but every time I've every encountered it there has been an orc in the staging area or it has only revealed an orc or two from the discard pile. Nine was just ridiculous....\n\nEdited October 28, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125850-2-quick-combat-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1315322","commentId":1315322,"userName":"Jban","timestamp":1414575420,"content":"Returning to the subject are these options possible after losing your defender to a shadow card?\n \n\n * Sneak - Gandalf/Orc Slayer (to kill the attacker)\n * Quick Strike/Haldir\n * Pursuing shadows/Rain of Arrows/Goblin-Cleaver/Taking Initiative\n\nI think you can, but don't know for sure.
