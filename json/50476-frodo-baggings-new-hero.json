Frodo then gets the Ring and at that point Gandalf asks Aragorn to search for signs of Gollum.\n\nKey days -\n\n * T.A. 3001............ Bilbo's farewell feast. Gandalf suspects his ring to be the One Ring. The guard on the Shire is doubled. Gandalf seeks for news of Gollum and calls on the help of Aragorn.\n * T.A. 3009............ Gandalf and Aragorn renew their hunt for Gollum at intervals during the next eight years, searching in the vales of Anduin, Mirkwood, and Rhovanion to the confines of Mordor. At some point during these years Gollum himself ventured into Mordor, and was captured by Sauron. Elrond sends for Arwen, and she returns to Imladris; the Mountains and all the lands eastward are becoming dangerous.\n * T.A. 3017............ Gollum is released from Mordor. He is taken by Aragorn in the Dead Marshes, and brought to Thranduil in Mirkwood. Gandalf visits Minas Tirith and reads the scroll of Isildur.\n\nSo it's not too much of a jump Frodo being around in terms of being a card, but all through the \"historical\" Hunt for Gollum, Frodo is happily living in the Shire and does not go on adventures.
