At first it wasn't a problem as you didn't seem to need them, as you'd be dead long before you had need of more than 5 wound markers, but as the game has evolved, and specifically with quests being long rambles with lots of progress needed, I think I'd like to see something like this addressed, too!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=698772","commentId":698772,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1348385940,"content":"yes i agree- on quest that have a large amount of progress and locations with the same it can be problem, same if you have steward of gondor and some other resource machine and dont spend any for a while\n\ni usually use progress for resources as i cant use damage and either one for locations as i wont get mixed up there\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=698776","commentId":698776,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1348386930,"content":"I use only damage tokens from lotr core set.

(No idea about the colors around it, but maybe make them darker so the bright red blood has a better contrast?)\n\n \n\nIf we can't come up with good-looking tokens, wich i doubt, we can always just put the 5 on top of the normal-looking tokens without messing with their colors (Excepto for the golden 5-resource, that one looks awesome  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])\n\n \n\nI really appreciate your assistance, this is something i was wishing and needing for months to make my LotR more cool looking and more practical too.\n\nEdited January 10, 2015 by Strilar"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1403319","commentId":1403319,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1421095526,"content":"I find it interesting that you think the 5-resource token looks like a completely new token considering I did the same thing for that one as I did for the others: adjust the hue, saturation, and lightness.

The 5-Wound and 5-Progress however, look like someone just sprayed red/green paint over them, on the 5-wound, the chainmail border is red, the \"skin\" is red and the wound is red, while on the 5-progress it's the same, green grass border, green path, green footprints, thus the 5-Resource looks like a \"real\" token while the others look obviously fake if that makes any sense.\n\n\n\n> Anyway, I tried a few variations: http://1drv.ms/1BV3TJK [http://1drv.ms/1BV3TJK]\n> \n>  \n> \n> That link goes to a shared folder.

Already discussed about this one above.\n\n \n\n\n\n> - token_stickers_border is an example of adding borders. I might be able to do better/more elaborate borders, but I was just demonstrating.\n\nI see what you mean now, the borders help make the tokens more distinct and one of my LotR players prefered this one, they look very plain with the solid colored border though (i know it's just a demonstration). I'm curious about what you have in mind for better/more elaborate borders. Maybe we could have \"blood\" on the wound token and leaves on the progress, but i would like to see your own ideias too.\n\n\n\n> - token_stickers_original just has the original token images (except resource token)\n\nYup, this was exactly what i had in mind and needed when i made my first post, but after seeing that 5-resource i'm excited to see if we can make them even more cool-looking! If all else fails, i'll use these, but i'm sure we can come up with something.\n\n\n\n> - token_stickers_reverse is an example of essentially reversing the colors (red switch to black and light to dark). I only worked on the damage token so far.\n\nOne of my players like this one for being \"distinct\" but i personally don't like the reversed-colored wound because we can hardly tell what picture it is, it doesn't even \"look\" like a wound with the colors switched, it's more like a dark blur or something. I'm curious about how the reverse-colored 5-progress would look though (green path, dirt footprints?)\n\n\n\n> - token_stickers_vivid is just an attempt to make the colors more vivid. Sadly, making brown vivid means making it red/orange, so that doesn't look so great to my eyes.\n\nI agree that the red/orange on the progress token doesn't look great, i do like the 5-wound though, wich is my favorite of these new versions, it looks distint enough from the 1-wound, and the wound looks more \"alive\", it still doesn't look perfect for some reason but i would still use this one i think.\n\n\n\n> Let me know what direction you like and I'll see what I can do.\n\nFinally, one of my friends gave some other suggestion, this time not just about the color scheme, but another way to make the 5-tokens look more distinct.\n\nHe made a basic sketch here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/yddyxhug3ydyewl/token_stickers_vivid_DANY2.jpg?dl=0 [https://www.dropbox.com/s/yddyxhug3ydyewl/token_stickers_vivid_DANY2.jpg?dl=0]\n\nIn case you can't see it, basically his ideia is to have 3 \"slash\" wounds instead of 1 on the other token, to make it look like a claw or something ( /// ) and to have more footprints on the 5-progress, we can easily put 4 footprints instead of 2.\n\nIf possible i would like to hear other player's opinions and suggestions, and maybe they can make their own versions of LotR LCG tokens as well. Would be cool to discuss diferent ones.\n\nIn any case, good job with these and thank you once more for helping, i look forward to your new variations of the stickers pictures for the LotR tokens!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71573-i-want-more-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=1404154","commentId":1404154,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1421142817,"content":"Awesome work.\n\n \n\nI just want to point out that having a different colour for the ressource token strike it more than just having more saturation.\n\nIf you take time into account, after a lot of finger touching those and all, saturation may fade away, and only the difference in colour will strike.
