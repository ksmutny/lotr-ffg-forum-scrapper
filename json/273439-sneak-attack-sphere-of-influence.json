I was definitively thinking of Stand and Fight. Maybe some wishful thinking also; the ever-sneaking Gandalf can get a little tiresome sometimes :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].\n\nBasically any card that lets you put allies into play (and there are quite a lot of them in the card pool now) works the same way (i.e. you don't need to have a hero of the same sphere as the ally that is being put into play). Resource matching is only needed when the ally is being \"played from hand\" (which is not the same as being \"put into play\"). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273439-sneak-attack-sphere-of-influence/?do=findComment&comment=3284901","commentId":3284901,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1523703609,"content":"Well, then you can play Curious Brandybuck, also without a Spirit hero.
