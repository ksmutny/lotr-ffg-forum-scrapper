Caleb is writing in regular, relatively conversational English, with all the imprecisions that that entails.\n\nI believe his intention is more in line with what you also said:\n\n> 13 hours ago, dalestephenson said:\n> \n> I suppose an objective hero intended to be used with a single scenario isn't really meant to be considered part of your collection of heroes\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309589-vision-of-the-palantir-thorongil/?do=findComment&comment=3959110","commentId":3959110,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1594043860,"content":"I'd guess that if asked, Caleb would certainly go against LAoM objective heroes as being part of \"your collection\" for the purpose of Thorongil (and Helm of Secrecy, though it could be argued that \"no threat cost\" is not the same as zero, so threat isn't actually comparable for that purpose).  So please, no one ask him.  Closing off this fun interaction benefits exactly no one.\n\nWhen I talk about my LOTR collection I mean *all* of the content, in the absence of additional qualifiers.  LAoM heroes are not part of my player cards, but they unambigiously are heroes in my collection."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309589-vision-of-the-palantir-thorongil/?do=findComment&comment=3963012","commentId":3963012,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1595179486,"content":"It just seems like a small over-sight, but Im sure Caleb did not intend for LaoM heros to be considered part of 'your collection.'
