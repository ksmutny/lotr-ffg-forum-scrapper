These results are skewed due to spirit Glorfindel and his bag of tricks, but other cards like Arwen, Master of the Forge, Rivendell Blade, Gildor, Erestor, Rivendell Minstrel, and Stargazer are great cards, and see alot of play without Glorfindel.

Just got Black Riders so I'm sure Hobbits will soon be #1. In Warhammer 40k it has to be Tau Empire whilst in LOTR strategy game it's Gondor!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92237-what-faction-are-you-yesanother-richsabre-poll/?do=findComment&comment=896926","commentId":896926,"userName":"jormungandr","timestamp":1382785397,"content":"j>a>f"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92237-what-faction-are-you-yesanother-richsabre-poll/?do=findComment&comment=897152","commentId":897152,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1382820857,"content":"My current deck, which I set up last Xmas to play Heirs of Numenor and have had set up all year, as I want to take it through the entire Against the Shadow cycle before I change it, is a Rohan-Gondor split, with a good dose of elves all the same.
