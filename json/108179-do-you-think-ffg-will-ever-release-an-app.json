It doesn't even have to be the game... Maybe just a deck builder. Sometimes you are just too lazy to get all the cards out and sort through them, and it would be nice just to have all the cards on your ipad as an easy way to look through them in a moment of boredom. And you could save all your decks on it... Maybe it could have all the rules and erratas too. It could be well handy. And if it was just a deck builder it wouldn't dent their sales, because you'd still need to buy the cards to play the game.\n\nI seem to remember one guy on here made his own app (inadvisedly!) and quickly had it taken down by FFG, so maybe there is a small possibility of FFG doing their own in the future.\n\nBut anyway... I was just wondering what you think.

Both have deck builders, both have online play. OCTGN is PC only (though apparently if you're a tech head you can get it working in wine on Mac and PC, but I do not know anyone that has been able to get it to work). LackeyCCG can play on Mac, PC, Linux and the iPad version is in its final RC releases and should be out any time now, just waiting on Apple approval basically.. and an Android version is in the works. The lackyCCG plugin is not kept uptodate as often as OCTGN. \n\n \n\nPersonally LackeyCCG is by FAR the better app to play the game in, it has save and load, crash protecting, built in functionality to play multihanded and more.. OCTGN has none of those options.\n\n \n\nLackeyCCG\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nOCTGN\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThere is ALSO a extremely advanced deck builder.

Have a play with it.. seriously phenomenal. \n\n \n\nIt can export decks to Lackey, OCTGN and forum posts.  Has statistical information, testing section, filters and card sorting and even effect filters.

The apple approval process is a very arduous one and Trevor (the developer) has had a child and moved house and more.. so a lot of life stuff has delayed it. I expect it should be out soon, though I have been saying that for a long time now! hehe\n\nJust a side note, I do not update the LackeyCCG plugin as often as I probably should. It will always get updates form me but if your looking for near Zero Day updates then the boy doing the OCTGN plugin are your guys. On the plus side it is very easy to update lackeyCCG yourself if you can not wait.\n\nAlso OCTGN has a \"proxy\" system, while lackeyCCG uses a censored card system. This means that even if you do not have the card images, you can play on OCTGN, but in LackeyCCG the most recent packs will be blurred. This is as FFG is only semi tolerant to these digital versions, and asks us to only release cards 6 months after the real cards have been published.\n\nAs for FFG making their own app? I think it is only a matter of time. They recently bought CardGameDB and though they reversed the decision they removed export for OCTGN form that site as part of a process to remove the digital versions. This was stopped at FFG, but the general rumor (and that is all it is) was that this was part of their process to pave the way for a official application.\n\nOn a personal note I think they are crazy to no make a digital app. It seams like money for nothing. Developing a video game version is just a logistics problem, the game, the art.. everything is done. Also the LCG pack format is a very comfortable and recognized idea in computer gaming circles.. they call it DLC. To be honest I find it incredible they haven't already started doing this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108179-do-you-think-ffg-will-ever-release-an-app/?do=findComment&comment=1115048","commentId":1115048,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1402386347,"content":"Is there any kind of legal constraint regarding using art for a digital version?
