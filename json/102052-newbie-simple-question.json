If I Sneak attack Gandalf into play during the encounter phase, does he go back into my hand before the combat phase.\n\nOr is it better to bring him into play after the Shadow Cards are dealt and then pop one of the enemy four 4 hit points. OR can I even do that? Easy question for you, a brain buster for me.\n\nThanx in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102052-newbie-simple-question/?do=findComment&comment=1022878","commentId":1022878,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1395533252,"content":"First - Yes, if you used Sneak Attack to put Gandalf into play during the encounter phase he would return to your hand at the end of the encounter phase, before combat, and that means you wouldn't be able to use him to attack or defend. If you used him during the combat phase, depending on your situation you'd probably get more use out of him. And yes, I'm pretty sure you can Sneak Attack him before you turn over the shadow cards. There is a flowchart in the back of the rulebook that explains where the action windows are, if that helps."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102052-newbie-simple-question/?do=findComment&comment=1023064","commentId":1023064,"userName":"tacomen253","timestamp":1395548103,"content":"Legolas18 is correct.\n\nÂ \n\nYou can use Sneak Attack immediately after the shadow cards are dealt to the enemies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102052-newbie-simple-question/?do=findComment&comment=1023138","commentId":1023138,"userName":"dizpatcher","timestamp":1395563183,"content":"Thought that was about it.\n\nThanx so much."}]}
