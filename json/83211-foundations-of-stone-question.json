He will add 0 bonus to Nameless thing by the way. Only one way to get Frodo back is :when you destroy Nameless thing frodo will be discarded and  you can play Fortune of Fate to get him back. Otherwise Frodo is dead."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83211-foundations-of-stone-question/?do=findComment&comment=790811","commentId":790811,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1367410440,"content":"  Thanks Glaurung.    :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83211-foundations-of-stone-question/?do=findComment&comment=790818","commentId":790818,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1367410919,"content":"to add…\n\nFrom FAQ\n\n \n\nQ: How does the card Lost and Alone (DD 124) work?\nWhat if the hero gets attached to a Nameless Thing\n(DD 125) or was my last hero in play?\nA: You only put the lost hero back into play if you draw\nthe hero, whether during the resource phase or through\na card effect. If the hero is discarded or attached to a\ncard like a Nameless Thing, then treat it like any other\ncard. In the latter situation, the value of the hero would\nbe null, since it has no printed cost. If your last hero\ngets shuffled into your deck you are not eliminated from\nthe game; heroes are not considered to be killed unless\nthey are in your discard pile. You will continue playing\nuntil you either draw the hero, are eliminated through\nother means, or the game ends."}]}
