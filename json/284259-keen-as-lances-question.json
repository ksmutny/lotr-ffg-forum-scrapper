Action: Add Keen as Lances to the victory display. Then, choose one: add 2 resources to a hero's resource pool, draw 3 cards, or reduce your threat by 4.\n\nRegards,"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284259-keen-as-lances-question/?do=findComment&comment=3497880","commentId":3497880,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1539148735,"content":"Hi,\nSome players cards go to the victory pile. Like Keen as lances for example. The second keen as lances, and that count for the group so no matter who play it, would only cost 4.\n\nHere is a link with some of the card who use the victory display: http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/8379/mono-lore-scrying-for-multiplayer-3.0 [http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/8379/mono-lore-scrying-for-multiplayer-3.0]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284259-keen-as-lances-question/?do=findComment&comment=3498002","commentId":3498002,"userName":"caribecards","timestamp":1539160820,"content":"Thank you!"}]}
