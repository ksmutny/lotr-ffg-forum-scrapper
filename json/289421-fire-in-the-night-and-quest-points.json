That is to say the 50 quest points printed on the main quest are still a necessary objective to achieve to be able to win or are simply a reminder of how much damage Hrogar's Hill can take before losing?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289421-fire-in-the-night-and-quest-points/?do=findComment&comment=3596682","commentId":3596682,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1547847254,"content":"Since the quest card says \"If Dragnir has no hit points, the players win\", that suffices.  The effective purpose of the 50 is to supply a damage comparison for the loss condition."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289421-fire-in-the-night-and-quest-points/?do=findComment&comment=3597237","commentId":3597237,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1547905082,"content":"@dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/] has certainly got it, but just to mention, as the same question has arisen on Discord several times… Shadow and Flame similarly has a win condition printed on a quest card, and a quest point requirement that nevertheless does not have to be met to win:\n\nhttps://boardgamegeek.com/article/12104824#12104824 [https://boardgamegeek.com/article/12104824#12104824]\n\nAnother parallel example is winning by destroying the Stormcaller in Flight of the Stormcaller.
