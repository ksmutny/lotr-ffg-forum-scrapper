He defends against a Wargs with a Muck Adder as shadow effect which decreases his defense by one.

If, however, you were in the same situation while playing The Massing at Osgiliath and revealed Wolves from Mordor (Shadow: Deal 2 damage to the defending character), Gimli would be toast unless you had a copy of Hasty Stroke (or Landroval, I suppose).\n\nThe round sequence chart at the back of the rulebook gives you a comprehensive idea of when you can and cannot take actions.
