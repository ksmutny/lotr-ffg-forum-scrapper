The idea behind this is that for one month (January ’12), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a 2 Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes used, and any additional narrative you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-month lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this month are valid. As the month unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the month.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the final Top Ten? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this month’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the month is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this 2 Player Tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].\n\nAnd now… on to this month’s 2 Player Tournament!\n\n2 Player Tournament #2:\n\nQuest: Return to Mirkwood\nDeck Parameters: Each Player may use 1-3 Core Sets + All Shadows of Mirkwood APs\nNumber of Players: 2 Players\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. muemakan ~ 83 (Théodred, Éowyn, Dúnhere) & (Frodo, Bilbo, Beravor)\n2. plueschi ~ 105 (Éowyn, Eleanor, Théodred) & (Thalin, Bilbo, Beravor)\n3.

She played all Spirit (Eowyn, Frodo, Eleanor) and I all Tactics (Thalin, Boromir, Legolas). It was discouraging starting off because we lost half our starting hands to Eyes of the Forest. We faced a Hill Troll starting in the staging area but thanks to Winged Guardian's sacrificial defense and boost to Eagles of the Misty Mountains, I took it out pretty quickly. We took a couple turns on the first stage but ran quickly through the forest thanks to the Rohirrim. We were fortunate enough not to draw any Attercops but did have to deal with the Hummerhorns at the end (Frodo absorbed the damage!)  we got through the 3rd stage in 1 turn and then faced a Wargs, Marsh Adder, and the Hummerhorns. Fortunately I had two Feints in my hand and was able to keep the Wargs from running away. Boromir attacked the Wargs and then readied to join with Legolas and Landroval to finish the Marsh Adder. The Hummerhorns were obviously engaged with my wife and Westfold Horse Breaker lent his horse to Legolas who did that sick flip move he does in Two Towers to mount up and ride down those Hummerhorns. This final kill gave us the two progess we needed to complete the fourth stage and win the game!

I wondered if you could help me out, I'm planning to play this today with a friend and I wondered how to build a deck that managed its threat as successfully as you. As I understand it you both played Greetings, that make sense, but I can't see how you managed it quite as well as you did and could do with some pointers.\n\nYour starting threats were 27 and 26, you had 9 rounds were your combined threat went up by 5 each round (1 each +3 for gollum). That makes 53+45 = 98 threat to needed to reduce. 6 Greetings makes 36 leaving 62 threat. The only other threat reducing card I know of is Gandalf but you'd need to play him 13 times (in 10 turns) to drop your threat by 62 and since I'm sure you didn't do that, I'm missing something.
