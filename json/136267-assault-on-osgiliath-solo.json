Conversely, I have also gotten trounced on the first turn or 2 if a really beastly enemy, like the Mumak, comes out.  My most fun game was one in which more Osgiliath locations just kept coming up and I had to really struggle to get control of them...ended up losing, but it was a great time.\n\n \n\nPlease do not think I am complaining about the difficulty (either way), just wondering if others have had a similiar experience with soloing this quest or if I'm maybe doing something wrong.  Seems like it would be one of those quests that really shines more brightly with multiple people playing.  \n\n \n\nThanks.\n\nEdited February 27, 2015 by Trialus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136267-assault-on-osgiliath-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1468633","commentId":1468633,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1425079225,"content":"Unfortunately, in solo play, the quest is a bit broken, as it's not uncommon to beat it one or two turns, especially if you're using Tactics Boromir to smash through the Ancient Harbor.

I used the West Gate as my selected first unique location and then used its Action text. Once I put it in my victory display, I would use its Action when I could and then make it the active location again to fulfill all the Action requirements. The only issues were when I had Ruined Tower in my Victory Display because when I placed West Gate back as the active location, Ruined Tower went back to the staging area. This was not necessarily a problem as I just worked it out so that they were the last three. The West Gate allowed me to control pretty well what I was dealing with location wise.\n\n \n\nAll that is a moot point because it appears from everything I have been reading, my interpretation of that requirement on the Quest card was incorrect. So, I will relegate this to multi-player mode only."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136267-assault-on-osgiliath-solo/?do=findComment&comment=2089286","commentId":2089286,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1457378363,"content":"I generally play every quest one-handed and two-handed solo to get a feel for how swingy it can be. You're absolutely right about this one. One-handed it can be quite random, but I find that enjoyable. Quests that are trivial in one mode or another have little replayability.\n\nAlso, I try to avoid hacks. I don't use Bomomir in Osgiliath, I don't use Hama in Shadow and Flame. I find that can increase the challenge somewhat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136267-assault-on-osgiliath-solo/?do=findComment&comment=2089496","commentId":2089496,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1457382855,"content":"Try the nightmare version... it's better (and brutal)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/136267-assault-on-osgiliath-solo/?do=findComment&comment=2090328","commentId":2090328,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1457423992,"content":"> Unfortunately, in solo play, the quest is a bit broken, as it's not uncommon to beat it one or two turns, especially if you're using Tactics Boromir to smash through the Ancient Harbor.
