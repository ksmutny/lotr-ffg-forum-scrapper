The question is, what happens then there are two enemies with identical engagement costs? in that case \"the enemy\" is actually two enemies, so how to decide?\n\n \n\nEdited March 3, 2017 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243908-engaging-checks-when-several-enemies-have-the-same-engagement-cost/?do=findComment&comment=2665635","commentId":2665635,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1488583874,"content":"hmm, my answer seemed a lot more useful before reading the quote from the other forum.\n\nOkay, when choosing which to engage I guess I assumed it was the first player's choice - though I don't have a reference for it and in practice we always let the engaging player choose, but as you note there isn't clarity on it.  However, I do think the text is fairly clear that you engage just one of them per pass."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243908-engaging-checks-when-several-enemies-have-the-same-engagement-cost/?do=findComment&comment=2665640","commentId":2665640,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1488584084,"content":"> 3 minutes ago, RichardPlunkett said:\n> \n> hmm, my answer seemed a lot more useful before reading the quote from the other forum.\n> \n> Okay, when choosing which to engage I guess I assumed it was the first player's choice - though I don't have a reference for it and in practice we always let the engaging player choose, but as you note there isn't clarity on it.  However, I do think the text is fairly clear that you engage just one of them per pass.\n\nAn alternate interpretation, I suppose, is that since it says you engage \"the enemy\" with the highest threat, and there are two, and there are no rules for how to decide, that you would get stuck and not be able to engage any enemy.  Thus, you lose, because the game cannot move forward...but I don't really like that interpretation :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nEdited March 3, 2017 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243908-engaging-checks-when-several-enemies-have-the-same-engagement-cost/?do=findComment&comment=2665652","commentId":2665652,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1488584678,"content":"The FAQ contains several rules/rulings of the form:\n\n(1.03) Conflicting Effect Targeting\nIf an encounter or quest effect attempts to target a single player or card, and there are multiple eligible targets, the first player selects the target of the effect from among the eligible options.\n\n \n\nSo I think it's safe to say, in the absence of any better reference or an official position, that the first player gets to choose, since it's hard to see an official ruling coming in any other way.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243908-engaging-checks-when-several-enemies-have-the-same-engagement-cost/?do=findComment&comment=2665655","commentId":2665655,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1488584838,"content":"> 6 minutes ago, RichardPlunkett said:\n> \n> The FAQ contains several rules/rulings of the form:\n> \n> (1.03) Conflicting Effect Targeting\n> If an encounter or quest effect attempts to target a single player or card, and there are multiple eligible targets, the first player selects the target of the effect from among the eligible options.\n> \n>  \n> \n> So I think it's safe to say, in the absence of any better reference or an official position, that the first player gets to choose, since it's hard to see an official ruling coming in any other way.\n> \n>  \n\nThe one good thing about this interpretation is that it makes using Follow Me! even better if you want to grief your teammates :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]\n\nI do think it makes some sense to allow the player (making the engagement check) to decide, though.  For example \"each player must deal 1 damage to a hero he controls\".  Technically, they are all heroes and there is a \"tie\".  The first player doesn't get to decide which hero to damage for player 2.  And the rules on engagement checks say \"...the player to his left makes an engagement check\".  So since it is specific to that player, I think he should be able to decide perhaps.\n\nEdited March 3, 2017 by cmabr002"}]}
