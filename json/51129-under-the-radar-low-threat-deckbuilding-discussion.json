With the addition of Frodo Baggins, I was finaly able to give it a try. Here's the decklist I came up with (from 3 Core Set, 1 The Hunt for Gollum and 1 Conflict at the Carrock), for solo play:\n\nHeroes:\n\n * Dunhere\n * Eleanor\n * Frodo Baggins\n\nLeadership:\n\n * 3 x Dunedain Mark\n * 3 x Steward of Gondor\n * 3 x Sneak Attack\n\nSpirit:\n\n * 2 x Eomund\n * 3 x Northern Tracker\n * 3 x Wandering Took\n * 3 x Unexpected Courage\n * 3 x A Test of Will\n * 2 x Dwarven Tomb\n * 3 x Hasty Stroke\n * 3 x Stand and Fight\n * 3 x The Galadhrim's Greetings\n\nLore:\n\n * 2 x Daughter of the Nimrodel\n * 1 x Gleowine\n * 2 x Henamarth Riversong\n * 1 x Rivendell Minstrel\n * 2 x Forest Snare\n\nNeutral:\n\n * 3 x Gandalf\n * 3 x Song of Kings\n * 2 x Song of Wisdom\n\nObviously, the idea is to keep your threat low enough that you never need to engage enemies and you pick them off from the staging area with Dunhere. Once he gets a few Dunedain Mark, he's able to kill any enemy without you ever having to face them directly.\n\nI played 4 games against Passage through Mirkwood (2 defeats, 2 wins), 2 against Journey Along the Anduin (2 wins), 2 against The Hunt for Gollum (2 wins) and 1 against Conflict at the Carrock (win). In all instances, I managed to beat my previous best score (except for Conflict at the Carrock; I still scored 14) without trying anything special (no \"squeazing\" the encounter deck for all victory cards or waiting additional turns for extra plays of Gandalf). The nature of the deck makes it so that your threat remains very low, resulting in great scores.\n\nMy first two tries didn't go very well. However, I'll put it on the count of getting East Blight Patrol on the first turn both times. That card is the perfect countermeasure to my deck: low engagement cost, high attack power. It means you're forced to use Frodo's ability and your threat starts to increase, meaning you then have to engage spiders and all other monsters and there's no end to it. Those games also let me get a feel for how to play the deck.\n\nA lesson I learned early is that you need an ally, idealy Eomund, on the first turn. Getting over those first 2 turns is the key, as if you can keep control of your threat there (meaning your threat is still under 25 after 2 turns), then you should be able to start taking control. Eomund's 2 Willpower is a great deal for 3 resources. He will definitively replace Lorien Guide in most decks I'll build, even if he's unique.\n\nTry to split your Unexpected Courage early. Getting one on Frodo or Eleanor means they can both quest and defend in the same turn, allowing you to deal with some of the low threat monsters (Dol Guldur Orcs, Misty Mountains Goblins) while still progressing on the quest.\n\nAs soon as you can lower your threat under 20, go for it. Under 15 is another critical number, depending on the scenario you're playing.\n\nObviously, abusing Gandalf (Sneak Attack, Stand and Fight) is another key component of the deck.\n\nFinally, regarding the songs, I chose to go with 3 Song of Kings as getting Steward of Gondor is much more important than getting any of the Lore cards. However, once you do get Steward of Gondor, you want to play it on whatever charcter will end up with Song of Wisdoms, as there are multiple 3-cost cards in Lore.\n\nAll in all, the deck makes for interesting starts. After 4 or 5 turns, as with most \"good\" decks, you can see how things are going to turn. Conflict at the Carrock was probably the most stressful scenario as I was afraid of overquesting for a few turns (a well-timed Despair actualy gave me a break until Henamarth joined my army), but once I had most of my allies in play (as well as grabbing Grimbeorn the Old on the way). I was ready for the Trolls.\n\nI now have to try it against Escape from Dol Guldur. I don't have much hope, but who knows. If I could get 1 win in 5 or 6 tries, I'd be happy.\n\nI'd like to hear people's thought on such a build and other options for a low-threat strategy. I considered using another 8 points hero (Denethor, Gloin, Theodred), but not having Dunhere would kind of defeat the purpose of a low-threat deck, I think. Another thing I'm considering is trying 2 players with 2 heroes only each (Frodo Baggins and Eowyn; Eleanor and Dunhere). Having access to 6 Unexpected Courage along with increased questing power from Eowyn (both decks would be built similarly, at least until further songs are available), would probably (or would it?) compensate for the additional card and lower resource count. What do you think?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/51129-under-the-radar-low-threat-deckbuilding-discussion/?do=findComment&comment=510462","commentId":510462,"userName":"avgzxc","timestamp":1312727907,"content":"I'd add A Light in the Dark.
