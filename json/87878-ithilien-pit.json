I can't find any rules that would clarify this.\n\n \n\nI believe you would need to wait until your own attack phase.  Ranged in the rulebook specifically states:\n\n \n\nA character with the ranged keyword can be declared \n\nby its controller as an attacker against enemies that are \nengaged with other players. A character can declare \nranged attacks against these targets while its owner is \ndeclaring attacks, or it can participate in attacks that are \ndeclared by other players\n \nThe first sentence falls in line with the effect of ithilien pit whereas the second sentence does not and seems unique to ranged"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87878-ithilien-pit/?do=findComment&comment=852380","commentId":852380,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1377696270,"content":"Ok, I sent the question into FFG and Caleb clarified that you do, indeed, have each player do their own attacks against the enemy during their own attack windows. Sad. This card would be much more powerful if every player could attack at the same time, but it's still powerful, especially since we can attack it even if it's in the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87878-ithilien-pit/?do=findComment&comment=3858832","commentId":3858832,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1577747577,"content":"> On 8/5/2013 at 1:48 PM, Morithain said:\n> \n> The wording on this card is confusing me.  When an enemy gets this attached to him, does that mean anybody can attack him immediately, or do you have to wait until the combat phase?\n\nThat was my first question as well.  Sounds like this card would be more useful in multi-player games (or multi-handed games) than in true solo.  Probably only worth having if the scenario has a difficult enemy with high engagement cost."}]}
