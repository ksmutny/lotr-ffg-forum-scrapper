Solo I beat Hunt for Gollum on the first attempt but took me several tries to beat Anduin solo.\n\nThe consensus is that the scenario rating system is based off of two-player games. So Hunt for Gollum and Journey Along the Anduin are both 4s when it comes to two-player games. Gollum would become something lower than 4 in solo and Anduin would become higher than 4. Dol Guldur is probably a 10 solo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52252-a-huge-disparity/?do=findComment&comment=520924","commentId":520924,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1314503963,"content":"Gollum can be very unpredictable i find - Hunters from Mordor are fairly easy to deal with if there are no clues out, but lethal if there are lots.

I find Gollum to be more predictable than other quests, at least in solo play. I think the reason for this is the lack of balance between questing and fighting. It is very heavily leaning towards questing, and there isn't a lot of fighting. You can also affect the staging area because you get to select quite a few cards to put there in the first two scenarios. So, you can manipulate the quest a lot more than you could previous ones. \n\nIt does make sense that scenarios are rated or averaged out for 2 players. I guess that's a good compromise between 1-4 players. I play solo, so that would explain why Gollum's difficulty bears little resemblance to Anduin's. I would say Gollum is difficulty 2 for solo players. Anduin may be more like a 6 and Dol Guldur is certainly right around 9-10. I only came close to passing that one once."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52252-a-huge-disparity/?do=findComment&comment=521365","commentId":521365,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1314594968,"content":"The difficult level in this game is really strange thing!!!

Leadership/Tactics (Aragorn, Theodred, Legolas) and Spirit/Lore (Beravor, Dunhere, Eleanor) and they started the game with 6 Threat and 4 Enemies in play after the Hill Troll had been added. Things were looking bad right away, but then the first quest phase added Marsh Drake and Wargs for a total of 11 Threat. Needless to say five of the six Enemies (including Hill Troll) were auto-engagements and while Aragorn survived the Troll's attack, killing anything was out of the question. Most of the characters were hanging on for dear life. Gandalf jumped in to defend against the Hill Troll on turn two, except the Troll drew a Shadow Effect that forced an exhausted ally to be returned to hand, yep, Gandalf was the only one available, so Troll was undefended. With Threat 35+ for both parties, Eleanor cancels Necromancer's Reach, only to draw Evil Storm that wipes out Aragorn, Beravor and Eleanor.\n\nYesterday we too got wiped out by HfG, triple-Clue draw late in the game (with 6+ locations in the staging area), then 2 Hunters from Mordor to guard the first two Clues. Threat hit 50 for both real fast. Yes, Spirit cards were in the game, but even with Beravor drawing like crazy, no Northern Trackers (ironically it was the exact same pair of decks as in the loss to JDtA above). Then the other two decks (Lore/Leadership and Tactics/Spirit) just molested Conflict at the Carrock for a relatively easy win, including killing two Hill Trolls during stage 1 and exploring all four copies to River Langflood. And this was with only Gandalf available as threat reduction. Didn't feel much like a difficulty 7 quest, not compared to the hammerings on the two plays of diff 4 quests just earlier."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52252-a-huge-disparity/?do=findComment&comment=521416","commentId":521416,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1314603745,"content":"Shelfwear said:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nGhostWolf69 said:\n\n \n\nStuff like that never happens in Anduin.\n\n \n\n \n\nReally?

You have plenty of ways to prepare for and counter effects coming from Treachery (like \"A Frightened Beast\") and Setup Instructions (Like the Hill Troll in Anduin.) Sometimes you suffer a bad draw and end up on the wrong side of luck, for sure, but usually, if you are prepared for it you can handle it.\n\nGollum IMO is really hard to counter. If bad luck shines (and it seems to do that quite alot) you cannot counter it. I see now way to counter Multiple \"Gollum Clues\" and \"Hunters of Mordor\" for instance, wheras I have \"Eleanor\" (God bless her) and lots of \"A Test of Will\" to counter Treachery.\n\nAnd that Hill Troll in Anduin? You KNOW it's gonna be there... so there's zero surprise involved. Sure you might have a crap hand all around the table so no one can deal with it even after all the Mulligans, but that is RARE in our group.\n\n\"There are instant kill moments in every quest so far. Its the unpredictable nature of a card game...\"\n\nOf course there is. I'm just saying some are more easily countered than others or doesn't appear as \"random / out of the blue\" as in Gollum. That is my experience.\n\n/wolf\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52252-a-huge-disparity/?do=findComment&comment=521425","commentId":521425,"userName":"GhostWolf69","timestamp":1314605256,"content":"The Opposite is also true, I've never had an Easier win than in Gollum.
