Some asked for the stories told by individual scenarios, others asked for isolated ‘What Ifs’, both of which we have now on our blog. But the overwhelming majority wanted to see our take on The Hobbit Campaign. I can confirm that will indeed be our next story, and I look forward to seeing what you think on this take of The Hobbit. May The Road rise to meet your feet!\n\nhttps://theroadlotr.wordpress.com/2020/12/04/the-hobbit/ [https://theroadlotr.wordpress.com/2020/12/04/the-hobbit/]"}]}
