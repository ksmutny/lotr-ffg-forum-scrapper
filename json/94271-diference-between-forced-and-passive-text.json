When determining the order of effect\nresolution among abilities within those categories,\nplayers should first resolve abilities that use the word\n“when” and then resolve abilities with the word “after”.\n \nSo from a rules standpoint, there is a reason why some text is passive and some is Forced.  But no particular reason, that I can see, why a card like Gladden Fields is Forced rather than passive, or why Hidden Path is passive rather than Forced."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94271-diference-between-forced-and-passive-text/?do=findComment&comment=919143","commentId":919143,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1385714254,"content":"Hidden Path has a constant effect.\n\nGladden Fields has an effect which triggers at a specified time."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94271-diference-between-forced-and-passive-text/?do=findComment&comment=919159","commentId":919159,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1385716391,"content":"mmmmh, ok,\n\nbut....\n\n \n\nIf there are 2 cards with the same 'forced', you must do both or only one when the thing that triggers them happens?\n\nFor example:\n\n \n\nffg_croaking-crows-otd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_croaking-crows-otd.jpg]\n\nCroaking Crows:\n\nForced: When a location is revealed from the encounter deck, put 1 progress on Smaug the Golden.\n\n \n\nIf there are 2 Croaking Crowns, and some 'forced' must be resolve one by one...., the second 'forced' is out?

It's not. After something happen and lot of things trigger, you should resolved all of them. Starting with passive first, then forced, then response. First player choose the order between each of the same. After each effect are resolved, other triggers that appeared can be triggered. Your game progression only resume when you have nothing else to trigger and proceed to the next action.\n\nExemple : if a character leaves play and you play heroic sacrifice, you can draw another heroic sacrifice and play it.\n\nOther exemple : the Nine are Abroad says to treat all character's text boxes as if they were blank until the end of the round. You have Gandalf in play. At the end of turn, the text of Gandalf is blank, so he doesn't go away, the passive wears off. But it's still the end of turn and the game didn't advance. So the forced effect of Gandalf will still trigger."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94271-diference-between-forced-and-passive-text/?do=findComment&comment=919280","commentId":919280,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1385736134,"content":"Ok thanks"}]}
