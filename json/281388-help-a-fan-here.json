Every now and then a thread will pop up with a troll giving faulty evidence that the game is dying. Take no notice of such.\n\nWell, eventually.

Learn to play and there are almost 200 quests (roughly 100 unique with extended difficulty for most).\n\nIt is a great experience to sit down and not have to learn a new game constantly but have each scenario be somewhat different so you get the best of both worlds. Replaying them with different decks is fun too.\n\nYou can take the game as seriously as you want, go it alone or build decks from the internet. Play easy mode or nightmare mode.  \n\nIn summation, it is an incredible thematic and well designed game, whose difficulty and time needed scale to your level of interest. While offering a new experience with each pack while allowing you to not learn a new set of rules each time when compared to buying constant new board games. Play alone or play with friends. This game has it all. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281388-help-a-fan-here/?do=findComment&comment=3448258","commentId":3448258,"userName":"gmcc","timestamp":1534923614,"content":"Yeah this would be for solo purpose but i dont even know how to build decks in this game.

As I intensely play some of those games for the half of my life I never found this game that hard... because I get to learn the hard way way before ^^.\n\nEvery Deluxe is a standalone (but difficulty of the scenario tempt to increase over the time), every saga is standalone but the main interest is to play them in the order (like....a saga ^^), every adventure pack (usually written AP) belong to a cycle and is linked to a deluxe (to the core set for the first cycle), you need the deluxe to play the scenario, and the whole deluxe+cycle make a story on their own (even more true since the third cycle).\n\nHave fun!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281388-help-a-fan-here/?do=findComment&comment=3448404","commentId":3448404,"userName":"PigsAreOurEquals","timestamp":1534940182,"content":"If deckbuilding is a new thing for you, you can find many excellent and fun decks on ringsdb.com.\nThere are useful filters so that you can check for decks made with packs you actuallly own.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281388-help-a-fan-here/?do=findComment&comment=3448452","commentId":3448452,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1534944442,"content":"In this game, when you deckbuild, you want to look add a good combinations of cards for the spheres of the Heroes you are using.
