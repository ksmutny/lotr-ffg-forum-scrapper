Banker.\n\nAction: Exhaust Gondorian Banker to add up 2 resources to one of your hero's resource pools.  During the next round the player does not collect X amount of resources to his heroes resource pools with X being the amount borrowed.\n\n \n\nI know this card would probably have problems but this is the best I could come up with and I think the Idea would be really fun.  If you have Ideas on how it could be better feel free to share.\n\n \n\n \n\nKhamul\n\nEdited December 1, 2013 by Khamul The Easterling"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94363-card-idea/?do=findComment&comment=920104","commentId":920104,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1385852406,"content":"Maybe you could gain one resource for each card you discard, or for every two cards you discard"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94363-card-idea/?do=findComment&comment=920230","commentId":920230,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1385881007,"content":"I had initially thought that selling cards would be Lore's primary way of generating more resources - as it struggles greatly with it.
