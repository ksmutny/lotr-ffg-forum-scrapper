Neither saga expansion uses encounter cards from the Core set.\n\nBut as others have pointed out, yes, there are not nearly enough player cards to make decks with just the saga expasions together. You'd need a lot more (which the Core provides) to make workable decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79698-how-does-on-the-doorstep-not-need-the-original-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=766401","commentId":766401,"userName":"Periculum","timestamp":1361627627,"content":"Each set of six Adventure packs use the encounter set from the box before it. The hobbit boxes are a special case at the moment. The core set is followed by the Mirkwood cycle, Khazad-dum is followed by Dwarrodelf, and Heirs of numenor is followed by against the shadow. At this time, the hobbit boxes don't mix with any of the adventure packs.\n\n \n\nSo many key cards are in the core box. While there are plenty of cards out side of the core box, I still don't see a good way to build decks without having at least one core."}]}
