Traveling to a location is completely optional.\n\nÂ \n\nKeep in mind, the benefits of traveling to locations is solely that it reduces the amount of threat in the staging area. If you are capable of completing the quest without traveling to the location, it is to your benefit (usually, not always) to ignore it. In the same manner, the benefit of engaging enemies is that their threat is no longer in the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58339-location-cards-in-the-staging-area/?do=findComment&comment=573934","commentId":573934,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1325538258,"content":"Thank You!
