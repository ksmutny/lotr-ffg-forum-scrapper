After an enemy card is revealed, it is added to the staging area.\n2. Enemy cards remain in play until they are defeated or removed from play by a card ability.\n3. If an enemy engages a player, it remains engaged with that player until it is defeated or removed from that player’s play area by a card ability.\n4. When an enemy enters a player’s play area from another game location, that enemy has engaged that\nplayer, and that player has engaged that enemy.\n5. An engaged enemy does not contribute its threat strength to the total threat strength of the staging\narea.\n6. Instead, each engaged enemy makes an attack during the combat phase.\n7. An engaged enemy remains engaged with a player until it is destroyed, moved to another play area, or\nremoved from play.\"\n\nNow my questions (I was very confused on these points and I see I was playing it wrong. So it's important for me to clarify these points 100%. Thanks for bearing with me!);\n\na) Number 3, 5 and 7 are valid regardless if the player engages the enemy or the other way around; the enemy engages the player, right?\nb) What time length does the number 7 above refer to? Will it will remain engaged (and won't contribute to the threat count, and will remain in player's play area unless a game effect moves it somewhere else) until the end of the phase, round or the game, if it isn't destroyed/removed/moved by then?\nc) An enemy engages with a player, not with a character, right? Does this means, if an enemy attacked a character in a specific phase, it doesn't have to attack again same character in another phase/round, right?\nd) Is there any difference between a player attacks an enemy and an enemy attack a player?\n\nMore will come about some other, related points after your responses."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279777-engaging-an-enemy/?do=findComment&comment=3416378","commentId":3416378,"userName":"icabod","timestamp":1532636814,"content":"> 3 hours ago, mrblue74 said:\n> \n> a) Number 3, 5 and 7 are valid regardless if the player engages the enemy or the other way around; the enemy engages the player, rig﻿ht?\n> b) What time len﻿gth does the number 7 above refer to?

In a 2-4 player game towards the end when even the lower threat decks are at 35+ threat, it can be tricky to make sure the non-combat focused decks don't get an unwanted enemy without optionally engaging."}]}
