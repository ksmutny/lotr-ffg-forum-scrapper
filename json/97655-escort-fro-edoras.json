He gets +1 ATK when a character leaves play.  Other cards have benefits too: Prince Imrahil readies when an ally leaves play and Horn of Gondor adds a resources to a hero when a character leaves play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97655-escort-fro-edoras/?do=findComment&comment=963206","commentId":963206,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1390547662,"content":"Also Escort from Edoras can be a good support ally in those quests that use willpower for various challenges, like escape tests in dead marshes and hide tests in black riders.\n\nWhen the time comes he can then be sacrificed for a power questing round or to a big enemy as cannon fodder (he is one of the few allies that can legally block witch king after all; not that there aren´t other ways around him)"}]}
