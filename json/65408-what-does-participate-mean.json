Yes, Legolas can use his ranged ability to destroy enemies engaged with other players and his Response is triggered (that's why it's called a \"response\"). If he has the Blade of Gondolin attached then  you get to place an extra progress token (3 instead of 2).\n\nNo, Brand does not have to single-handedly attack and kill an enemy to trigger his ability. He simply has to be a partcipant."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65408-what-does-participate-mean/?do=findComment&comment=639256","commentId":639256,"userName":"gvaughn1","timestamp":1338573779,"content":" Thanks.
