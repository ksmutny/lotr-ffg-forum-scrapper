That player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders against each enemy attacking him this phase.\n\nThe card:\n\nM1038.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1038.png]\n\nAnd my questions ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] :\n\n1. Can you play this event when you reveal a shadow card of an enemy that is attacking to you (you defended with one character but, for exemple, his shadow card dealt increase the power of attack by 2, and you see your character will die, so you use this event and add other character to avoid the death of the first defender) Can you do it?\n\n2. You declare X characters as defenders against each enemy attacking. Then: each character declared as defender can defend each attack, even he was exhausted (for example, as the card...\n\nM1682.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1682.png]\n\nthat can declare as defenders exhausted characters).\n\nCan you? Whit this event, X characters joined can defend all attacks of each enemies?\n\n3. The normal way: you declare X characters against only one attack. At the first of combat phase.\n\n \n\n3rd option is true, but... 2nd and 1st also?\n\n \n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93013-stand-together/?do=findComment&comment=901839","commentId":901839,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1383518835,"content":"1- You couldn't use it after a shadow effect has been revealed -- this card gives you the ability to declare defenders, and delcaring defenders takes place at an earlier step of attack resolution.\n\n \n\n2- Stand and Fight doesn't give you the ability to defend while exhausted.  You still have to declare the defender legally (meaning, the characters needs to be ready).  The only thing it does is allow you to declare simultaneous defenders.  So, you declare 3 characters as defenders against 1 attack, then exhaust all 3.  Those characters cannot defend again unless you are able to ready them.  If you used Grim Resolve to ready a bunch of characters, you would be able to declare any and all of them again to defend additional attacks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93013-stand-together/?do=findComment&comment=902142","commentId":902142,"userName":"Demoncow","timestamp":1383575536,"content":"so stand together(core) and light the beacons(HoN) is an amazing combo especially with gondorian spearmen(core) and spear of the citadel(HoN)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93013-stand-together/?do=findComment&comment=902222","commentId":902222,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1383583835,"content":"wow, true\n\nNice combos"}]}
