But both requires special deck builds for multi player as none of my usual decks contain all of them.\n\nWhich led me to have my primary deck around, a secondary deck (if someone does not have a own deck or I want some variety) and a third supportive deck which is basically only suitabe for these kind of three or four player missions.

Swap Elf Helm for something else.  Don't need trap recycling? Swap Anborn for something else.  Your friend is running Dain? Include Blue Mountain Traders and Erebor Hammersmiths.  Your friends are using unique versions of some of the cards in this deck? Swap them out for other high stat allies. Really, with this deck you can change the majority of the cards and it still works. \n\n \n\nI will say that this deck seems to work best in conjunction with my Dain, Thorin, Ori deck.  Occasionally the Elrond deck gets stuck with too many high cost cards in hand and cannot get Vilya.  With my Dwarf deck I am often able to give the Elrond deck 15-20 resources with We Are Not Idle and the player can play 4-5 strong allies.  Perhaps it will be fun for you to play and won't feel so support oriented.\n\n \n\nHeroes\n    Bifur\n    Elrond\n    Glorfindel [spirit]\nAllies (29)  \n 1x Beorn\n 1x Boromir\n 2x Eagles of the Misty Mountains\n 1x Gwaihir\n 1x Landroval\n 1x Legolas\n 2x Arwen Undómiel\n 2x Elfhelm\n 2x Imladris Stargazer\n 3x Northern Tracker\n 1x Anborn\n 2x Gildor Inglorion\n 1x Haldir of Lórien\n 2x Master of the Forge\n 3x Warden of Healing\n 3x Gandalf [Core]\n 1x Treebeard\nAttachments (18)  \n 2x Light of Valinor\n 2x Unexpected Courage\n 2x A Burning Brand\n 2x Asfaloth\n 3x Lembas\n 3x Ranger Spikes\n 3x Vilya\n\n 1x Forest Snare\nEvents (3)  \n 3x A Test of Will"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190550-any-house-rules-on-location-lock/?do=findComment&comment=1836567","commentId":1836567,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1444142253,"content":"I definitely know what you mean.  If you're playing 4 player, Northern Trackers and Glorfindel/Asfaloth are often a necessity.  I've never actually tried this house rule, but I've thought about allowing 2 active locations when playing with 4 and maybe 3 players.  There would need to be a first in, first out system with the active locations so you couldn't slap a path on need on one location and keep exploring the other active location."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/190550-any-house-rules-on-location-lock/?do=findComment&comment=1836730","commentId":1836730,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1444147303,"content":"I was just about to suggest 2 active locations as a possibility. i've never played above 2-player so I have no idea what things are like up there though.

I want to address SURGE (which contributes to this). I'm seriously sometimes wondering if surge should never be allowed to add more than P cards (P = # of players). I'm also starting to disregard the \"surge anytime\" ruling. Surge during staging? Fine. Surge in some random other moments, yes even if you tell me to REVEAL? No way.
