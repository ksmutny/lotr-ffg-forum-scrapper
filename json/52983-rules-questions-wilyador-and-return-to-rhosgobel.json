If Wilyador leaves play, the players have lost the game.\n\nAnd Return to Rhosgobel 3b:\n\nWhen Revealed: Heal 5 wounds from Wilydor for each Athelas objective card the players control.\n\n \n\nBy card text, it looks like you can only heal a maximum of 5 wounds on Wilyador, even if you control more than one Athelas card. Which would make the effect completely pointless and the quest unplayable, so I'm probably wrong... right?\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52983-rules-questions-wilyador-and-return-to-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=526723","commentId":526723,"userName":"Troymk1","timestamp":1315734077,"content":" each single card of Athelas is maxed out at 5 healing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52983-rules-questions-wilyador-and-return-to-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=526727","commentId":526727,"userName":"Hojyn","timestamp":1315734526,"content":"Troymk1 said:\n\n each single card of Athelas is maxed out at 5 healing.\n\n\n\nThat's probably the correct interpretation, yes.\n\nNonetheless, the \"card effect\" comes from Return to Rhosgobel, not the Athelas cards (these have no effect at all). It's just poor wording, I guess, but I thought I'd check. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52983-rules-questions-wilyador-and-return-to-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=526760","commentId":526760,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1315740274,"content":"I think you're actually right (it is a single card effect that heals more than 5 wounds).
