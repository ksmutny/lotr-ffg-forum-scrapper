I remember time of core set when every player play Gandalf with stand and fight from discard pile. Then in the first faq ffg change the rules. Which is make sense. That was to broken combo…..\n\nText should read: must belong to any sphere….."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126627-dwarven-tomb-stand-and-fight-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=1330275","commentId":1330275,"userName":"Gibby","timestamp":1415704482,"content":"Crabble, \n\nI don't fully understand which are the instances of sphere rule related issues that your question \"So where is the difference\" pertains to. \n\nLet me take a blind stab and go through an examples of how Stand and Fight and A Good Harvest should work given their wording. \n\n \n\nA Good Harvest. The card reads:\n\nAction: Name a sphere. Until the end of the phase, you can spend resources of any sphere when paying for cards that belong to the named sphere.\n\nExample of allowed action: Name Tactics and play Thicket of Spears paying with a resource from say Aragorn, Denethor, and Baggin's sphere Bilbo each. \n\nExample of invalid action: Name Tactics and play Thicket of Spears paying with a resource from Aragorn, Denethor and Gandalf (Hero).\n\nIn the latter case Gandalf does not belong to a sphere and hence his resources cannot be spend as tactics resources, even with A Good Harvest. \n\n \n\nStand and Fight: \n\nAction: Choose an ally with a printed cost of X in any player's discard pile. Put that ally into play under your control. (The chosen ally can belong to any sphere of influence.)\n\nIt seems painfully obvious that the text in parentheses was added as a clarification that the ability to recur allies is not restricted to Spirit allies. If its purpose had been to restrict its usage by excluding neutral allies, then it would have read \"The chosen ally MUST belong to A (or ANY) sphere\" or even \"Neutral allies cannot be chosen\". Also, in that case the role of the parentheses would not be very clear. \n\nIgnoring the added reminder text, nobody would have doubted that the card can be used to return Gandalf from a discard pile to play, except for those doubting that anything outside the Spirit sphere can be returned at all. I admit that the reminder text as it is phrased is a bit awkwardly. My guess is that the phrasing is an artefact of a designer not being aware of the existence an allies that does not belong to any sphere (Gandalf). If there were no sphereless allies, then the text would be perfectly clear in its function to express that the ability is not restricted to Spirit allies. The intention of the phrasing becomes less clear and confusing in the presence of the coreset's sphereless ally. However, even with the confusing wording, Gandalf is not excluded as a target (since it is nowhere stated that the chosen ally HAS TO (or MUST) belong to a sphere. \n\n \n\nThe ruling that followed, as MightyRauros pointed out, was probably to prevent overly excessive Gandalf abuse in the early days of the game (as if Sneak Attack * 3 (6 with dwarven tomb) plus three hardcasts per player weren't enough). While I think  that this was not the most appropriate way to address the Gandalf issue, I respect the designers' intention. What bothers me about the ruling is that it attempts to retcon the misguided reminder text by bending it beyond any reasonable interpretation of its original phrasing. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126627-dwarven-tomb-stand-and-fight-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=1330567","commentId":1330567,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1415720476,"content":"If you just consider the Stand and Fight ruling an \"errata\" rather than a \"clarification,\" we can drop all the passive aggressive silliness that comes up every time we discuss this card.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126627-dwarven-tomb-stand-and-fight-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=1330746","commentId":1330746,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1415729622,"content":"> If you just consider the Stand and Fight ruling an \"errata\" rather than a \"clarification,\" we can drop all the passive aggressive silliness that comes up every time we discuss this card.  \n\n \n\nWell spoken. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nBack in the days where we had a limited card pool availabe this ruling might have been \"big\" and surely could have been better by making an errata to Stand and Fight itself rather then making a \"new\" rule like they way they did but you know I think I got used to it over the last years and with 3*Tome of Atanator and 3*Sneakattack you can still do a fair amount of legal Gandalf abuse if you want."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126627-dwarven-tomb-stand-and-fight-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=1331230","commentId":1331230,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1415752306,"content":"For the record, I did not intend to engage in \"passive aggressive silliness.\" As a newish player who has only played Core + Mirkwood cycle, I do not have access to a broad card pool, have not \"snuck a peek\" of cards in sets I have not yet played (I like to be surprised when I get a new set) that may render Stand and Fight obsolete, and was not aware of the history of discussions regarding the Stand and Fight card.\n\n \n\nI don't know how long Gibby has been playing the game, how large a card pool he has, or the extent to which he has followed the Stand and Fight debate over the years. And I did not research the history of the Stand and Fight debate on these boards before I replied to jimjim19681968's question… I just quoted the FAQ (which remains the only official document on the subject put out by FFG beyond the Core rules), gave my two cents, and evidently a number of players including Gibby think the ruling and wording of the FAQ for Stand and Fight are inadequate (whether as a clarification or errata), which is a reasonable position, and chimed in. \n\n \n\nAt the risk of sounding passive aggressive… Is it really necessary to accuse those of us who don't have the years of experience, card pool, and historical knowledge of discussions regarding a specific card of engaging in \"passive aggressive silliness\" or \"Gandalf abuse\"???  \n\n \n\nAnd don't get me wrong… I can easily live with the Stand and Fight ruling. It's not like being able to fetch Gandalf out of the discard pile using Stand and Fight is critical to victory in the majority of games, even with limited (Core only?) card pools. The bigger issue here is how some posters/players are making assumptions and characterizing other posters/players unfairly. \n\n \n\nGrand Spleen, I respect your knowledge and experience of the game, and the tone of most of your posts on these boards is both knowledgeable and respectful… but I think that you yourself came across as passive aggressive and full of assumptions this time around that aren't exactly charitable to newbies.

I see none of that passive-aggression here. Maybe a bit of silliness, but that is always a given here :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] The discussion is interesting and quite civil, is it not? perhaps I missed something.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I grant the topic is for many discussed to death. But not all of us have been here from the inception of the game and something so controversial as this ruling is bound to come up once in a while. It is because it shocks majority of players who hear it for the first time. I know I was devastated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nStill, you are very right Grand Spleen that all this discussions would have been avoided by doing an errata.\n\n \n\nUnfortunately, the designers decided to publish official interpretation instead. So since they chose that way, they were not supposed to alter the rules (which is natural and expected form time to time), but to act within the existing rules system. And most players felt the Stand and Fight ruling was absolutely not in line with the game system. It seemed like a random and arbitrary modification through means that were designed not to change the principles, but only to clarify minute details.\n\n \n\nThe rulebook, the card texts, FAQs and official interpretations all create the rules of the game we love. The illogical ruling on Stand and Fight damages the cohesiveness of the system. It makes the rules less comprehensible in general, and adds totally unnecessary layer of casuistry that we need to observe. Of course we can shrug it off as not important (\"just a game\", \"co-op only so do what you like\"), but then we can do that about any aspect of this game.\n\n \n\nThat is why people keep discussing it, and that is why perhaps it would be best to address this properly one day. I would love a new reverse ruling. Perhaps it is not possible for some reasons (balance?). But if not, an errata to solve once and for all would be nice. Until then, this for me is a gaping hole in the otherwise generally quality fabric of the game.\n\n \n\n \n\n> Then in the first faq ffg change the rules. Which is make sense. That was to broken combo…..\n\n \n\nPerhaps it did, I can certainly be persuaded to believe that. But publishing a casuistic and controversial ruling is not the proper way to address it. It creates more trouble than it solves. It just feels like bending the rules so that the card sort-of, kinda works the way you wish, instead of actually fixing the text.\n\n \n\nBTW, I actually always felt that the SaF ruling just \"happened\", without any greater sense or reason. But maybe I am wrong, it is just my impression.\n\n \n\n \n\n> Text should read: must belong to any sphere…..\n\n \n\nYes, something like that would do.
