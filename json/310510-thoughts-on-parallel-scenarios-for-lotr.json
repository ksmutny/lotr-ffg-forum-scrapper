A hero redone with a different ability and/or stats and maybe a card or two different with an accompanying quest. So for the mere fun of it what kind of hero redo/accompanying quest would you guys like to see?\n\n \n\nFor me personally I would love to see Na'asiyah get a new version along with a new sailing quest. My thoughts on a redo for hers would be:\n\nNa'asiyah\n\n8 Threat\n\nTactics \nWillpower 1\n\nAttack 2\n\nDefense 2\n\nHit Points 4\n \n\nCorsair, Warrior\n\nResponse, After Na'asiyah participates in an attack that destroys an enemy, add one resource to her resource pool. If that enemy had any resource tokens on it, add these to her pool as well.\n\nAction: Spend a resource to ready Na’asiyah, limit once per phase.\n\n\n\nI think this version of her would be a cool interaction with many of the Corsair enemies in the game so she could pillage their loot and use it to ready herself. \n \n\nFor accompanying cards:\n\n\nAlly\n\nCorsair Mercenary\n\nTactics \n\nCost 0\n\nWillpower 2\n\nAttack 2\n\nDefense 2\n\nHit Points 3\n\nForced: At the end of the round you must pay a resource or place Corsair Mercenary into the staging area and it loses the Ally type and gains the enemy type with threat equal to its willpower. \n \n\n \n\nAttachment \n\nCutlass \n\nCost 1\n\nAttach to a Corsair Hero\n\nRestricted, limit one per hero\n\nThe attached hero gains +1 Attack for each resource on it.\n\n \n\nEvent\n\nSpoils of War\n\nTactics\n\nCost 0\n\nAction: Place a resource token on each Non-creature enemy in play. After that enemy is defeated, the attacking player adds that resource to one of its heroes resource pools.\n\n\nAnd the quest would be sailing into the Northern Waters to break the ice and chart uncharted waters in search of a lost treasure ship. \n \n\nSo how about you guys, what would you like to see?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310510-thoughts-on-parallel-scenarios-for-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=3975168","commentId":3975168,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1597603655,"content":"I like your card ideas.

I think the only difference for this version is it’s the same sphere instead of a different one like is the norm. Plus accompanying cards/quest. "}]}
