The Steward's Fear.\n19. Encounter At Amon Din.\n \n \n \nPast these 19 scenarios with no problem. I tried it four others that I can not for the pass:\n \nThe Redhorn Gate - Combo Caradhass and Snowstorm (especially when you have five Snowstorm cards in the encounter deck) in last stage is terrible.\nThe Siege Of Cair Andros - In last stage had an infinite loop: I had four cards in the encounter deck - Lieutenan Of Mordor and The Power Of Mordor, so I had to lift the threat of 3 to infinity.\nThe Druadan Forest -  Keywords Prowl I hate it. wounded I crawled far into the 2nd stage and there I died.\nAssault on Osgiliath - I controlled all areas of Osgiliath without Ruined Tower, to which I could not travel - \"Travel: If there is one active location, exhaust a character to travel here. (There are now two active locations.)\" - This is the only way to traveling here?\n \nhas anyone tried these four scenarios for 4 players?

I do not doubt it, i think  (and of course the fact that it is based on the books Tolkien'a) is the main reason for its popularity.\nThe fact that I bought a second core set to have four trackers, is possible to play without them, but the two players he feels uncomfortable to write about your threat on a piece;)\nI don't have  a problem gather 4 players,  just because when I show once to somebody  this game ... and he become addicted from this game  ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\nI believe that the game works superbly with 4 players (only these four scenarios I don't know how to bite  :angry: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_angry.png] )\nEdited October 20, 2013 by 13thcaesar"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92374-passage-through-middle-earth-for-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=892868","commentId":892868,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1382304342,"content":"no problem ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\ni see your point about being in a minority....as i say, it may be down to the box saying 3-4 player availability only with two core sets....potential player groups may see this and think 'i can either buy this game twice, or go and find a game which i only need to buy once'...if these players were told it is mainly the trackers that is the problem perhaps we would see more 4 player groups.\n\n \n\n...then again perhaps im talking rubbish (as usual ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] )\n\n \n\ni cannot really comment at length on player groups. i have only played a handful of times with 3 player, and i enjoyed it very much. playing in a group has a distinctive feel to it, very different to playing on your own (initially wrote 'playing by yourself' haha)\n\n \n\nboth have their good sides....when playing solo i can get into the theme, and the immersion is higher, but group play is more of a 'game' game, to me at least... to have with some beers and a chat with friends\n\n \n\nrich\n\nEdited October 20, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92374-passage-through-middle-earth-for-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=892891","commentId":892891,"userName":"13thcaesar","timestamp":1382306480,"content":"This game is a thematic even with 4 players (but I know what you mean) - that's why I want to play this campaign to show the narrative side of this game to other players (as the story develops - my group  saw just a movie, so I also become as a guide the Middle-Earth).\n \nHow I introduced it to one topic, I wish I could play the campaign in a tournament (the official tournament rules do not appeal to me) - split us into two two-person group that will be able to be combined in the main cities, but at the same time each player will compete with others. - And see which one of us go to far  (would use a rule of the fallen heroes). but first  I wants , my group has gained experience, learn strategies for each scenario and show them narrative side of this game. so I first want to play the campaign with 4 players.\n \nI'm waiting for the moment when we will be able to do a typical theme decks for every race / faction - then everyone will be able to represent your favorite race and compete with the \"family\" site. I hope that before this game dies, we will have developed enough of all races / factions will be represented with all the free peoples of Middle-earth  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] \n\n \n\nAnd available all regions of Middle-earth. it would be great playing such a campaign (Passage through Middle-earth) if we had available all  regions and developed all races/ factions.\nFor example: You want to play hobbits? start of quests in the Shire.
