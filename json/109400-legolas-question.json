Always place progress tokens on an active\n> location instead of the quest, unless the ability\n> specifically states to bypass any active location.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nConcerning what Booored and I said :\n\n \n\n> Q: If there is an active location with the text \"Immune\n> to player card effects\" when Legolas participates in an\n> attack that destroys an enemy, do I place 2 progress on\n> the active location or the quest?\n> A: No. When Legolas' ability would put progress on\n> the current quest, if there is an active location, it puts\n> progress on that location instead. If that location is\n> immune to player card effects, it ignores Legolas'\n> ability. Therefore, no progress would be placed on the\n> active location or the current quest.\n> \n>  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109400-legolas-question/?do=findComment&comment=1133979","commentId":1133979,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1403784205,"content":"This is a game effect as well.. so same goes for Longbeard Elder or anything with similar progress token placement on the \"quest\"\n\nEdited June 26, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109400-legolas-question/?do=findComment&comment=1135260","commentId":1135260,"userName":"Aragorn son of Will","timestamp":1403874164,"content":"Okay I just read the core rulebook and it agrees thanks"}]}
