If the transaction was made and the product in the buyer's power, they should be able to show it at will. Now regarding hero Amarthiul, first of all it's unexpected and awesome to have him, since Turch never became a player card. His ability is very good, but I think the lack of willpower really hurts the Dunedain archetype, i.e. the Secret Defenders deck this cycle was supposed to develop. For example, Rohan has Eowyn, hobbits have Sam, silvans have Galadriel and Celeborn, noldor have countless high wp heroes, etc while Dunedain have at most 2 wp heroes, which really hurts the deck for solo. And I know this is not a faction game and I could just put Sam but we still should be able to build strong solo faction drcks. And Stwb is never a guaranteed first turn play, and in current quests you just need good questing from the start. Still, he's a great combat splash hero.

If the transaction was made and the product in the buyer's power, they should be able to show it at will. Now regarding hero Amarthiul, first of all it's unexpected and awesome to have him, since Turch never became a player card. His ability is very good, but I think the lack of willpower really hurts the Dunedain archetype, i.e. the Secret Defenders deck this cycle was supposed to develop. For example, Rohan has Eowyn, hobbits have Sam, silvans have Galadriel and Celeborn, noldor have countless high wp heroes, etc while Dunedain have at most 2 wp heroes, which really hurts the deck for solo. And I know this is not a faction game and I could just put Sam but we still should be able to build strong solo faction drcks. And Stwb is never a guaranteed first turn play, and in current quests you just need good questing from the start. Still, he's a great combat splash hero. I do hope though that we get some kind of wp boosting attachment for the Leadership Tactics dunedain deck to work in solo.\n\nI was really hoping for a low threat cost alternative option to Sam and at 10 threat and his abilities Amarthiul is definitely a nice option but 1 willpower is definitely very troubling... if he just had 2 willpower and only 2 defense..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1872861","commentId":1872861,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1446270006,"content":"Dunedain definitely won't be heavy questers, but I guess we kinda knew that the archetype was all about combat.  Too bad for solo players, but it's starting to get pretty interesting for multiplayer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1872922","commentId":1872922,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1446279807,"content":"This hero has unique stat box.

Also it is just annoying because they are still fairly new and fresh and part of the current cycle so are for many players the most played quests right now.\n\n \n\nI can't think of any hero that cannot be used in certain quests (excluding Saga where this sort of thing really needs to happen or quite a few quests would make no sense, Saruman or Grima fighting themselves, two copies of Aragorn in play etc) except for Faramir and now Amarthiul.\n\n \n\nAlso seriously what is with his 3 health...? why does he not have at least 4? He is a dunedain warrior.... not a hobbit or dwarf... dwarves only have TWO heroes with 3 hitpoints btw and every single other one has at least 4 yet this guy somehow has 3...\n\nyep thats right hes ranked with people like Eowyn and Denethor and Caldara for hitpoints... \n\n \n\nHe also has 3 defense, 3 attack and 1 willpower so is more or less built for combat yet has this high defence but awful amount of hitpoints... the 1 willpower also seems to be a massive waste of a stat..... \n\nA statline of 0/3/3/4 would be way better on this guy. 2/3/2/3 would be even better. Hell I'd even pay the extra single starting threat to have him be 2/3/3/3 or even 1/3/3/4. I would even prefer he be 2/2/2/4 like Halbarad as boring as that is!! That single hitpoint makes all the world of difference!\n\n \n\nStruggling with this hero personally.... amazing abilities that fit right into the Dunedain theme and make Dunedain decks far more of an option now and great traits (warrior, ranger AND dunedain) but to me the absolute worst stat line ever for both what he is meant to represent and what you want to do with him (attack AND defend). Awful health yet high starting defence and no sentinel so a very awkward and below average defender. Lastlucker willpower and an attack value of 3 which is nice but can be found across a multitude of heroes most of which have additional offensive abilities. \n\nSo he doesn't quest well, is an average and risky defender at best and is even an average attacker... \n\nI know I am judging this hero very harshly and he does have fantastic abilities but I had high hopes for this hero and he seems like he is all about the abilities to me :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nEdited November 2, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1874780","commentId":1874780,"userName":"Valiko33","timestamp":1446458662,"content":"Thanks for the illustrations DeadLord. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nI'm not agree with you PsychoRocka. 3 Defense is a very good stat for a Hero!\n\nOnly 7 heroes have 3 or more defense (Beregond (4) and Dáin Ironfoot Denethor Elrond Erkenbrand Gandalf and Treebeard having 3). On a pool of 65 heroes, it's pretty cool ! And it's hard to say it's a bad defender. Even with 3 HP. I agree that 3 HP is a bit low, but i used to play Denethor as main defender, and he also has 3 def and 3 HP. It's a Dunedain, so you can play Weather Hill Watchman to retrive Dunedain Warning and have very quickly 4 Def, which is very strong. Maybe we will have a dunedain attachement that boosts the HP of a Dunedain Hero. Maybe the Lore Cloack on the Dread Realm pack...\n\n \n\n3 attack is also huge ! Except for Beorn, no hero have more than 3 in attack.\n\n \n\nI love the idee of helping a hero in a cycle, playing with him as an objective, and then, when you saved him, you can play him as a Hero. I find the idea very thematic, and it increase the immersion and improve the narration. For me it's not an issue that you can't play him on 3 scenarios. There are now 70 scenarios available to play. If you for example choose randomly your scenario at the beggining of a game, you can play with him 96% of the times. Otherwise, you can just swap him with Mablung for example.\n\n \n\nAnd his abilities are so strong! Having acces to feint, to Dunedain Hunter... when 1 enemy engaged is so cool!\n\nAnd the extra resource is amazing too.\n\nEdited November 2, 2015 by Valiko33"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1874787","commentId":1874787,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1446459782,"content":"I think I would have him something like 2/2/3/4."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1874788","commentId":1874788,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1446459952,"content":"I must admit Feint is the very first card I thought of with him, works very well.

Don't forget that if you don't try to kill your enemies, you're also saving yourself a few character actions as you don't need attackers during your first few turns.

Then, all 3 of them have some tricks to remain ready for combat, and they can help there too.  The spirit allies are willpower questers.  The deck also includes A Watchful Peace to try to slow down the number of enemies getting pumped out by the encounter deck, and Arwen to give Sentinel to Boromir.\n\n \n\nThe other deck usually quests on turn 1 to try to clear the active location.  It tries to set up the Song of Wisdom + Burning Brand combo for Boromir, but the most important early card is Gondorian Shield to get his defense up to 4 (5 with Arwen).  \n\n \n\nThe problem has been, as you may have guessed, threat.  The Boromir deck relies on Aragorn + Sneak Attack/Gandalf.  The spirit deck has some Galadhrim's Greeting.  Once set up it can handle any combat thrown its way, but getting set up is a problem.  Also, once doing a regular willpower quest, the spirit deck struggles to pump out enough willpower to keep up in the early game, and often I'm raising my threat due to questing unsuccessfully for one or two rounds.  \n\n \n\nI haven't won yet, so the strategy isn't quite there.  I've considered swapping Boromir for Elrohir, but then I have to work in Elladan somehow (replace Legolas?  I hate to lose that progress), and then I also need another card to set up the combo (Steward of Gondor).  Could also put in Eowyn --maybe replacing Idraen -- to give a little bit extra willpower questing.  I usually clear that Battle keyword location with some progress to spare, so losing the turn 1 attack power is OK.  But losing the combat readiness would hurt.\n\nEdited November 15, 2015 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1894437","commentId":1894437,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1447612730,"content":"In my one win I had two Dunedain Hunters in my opening hand and I played them straight away to get a couple of Orc Grunts out of the deck.\n\nI just tried the Erestor Love of Tales deck, but I threated out on turn three.

Really underwhelmed by it right now. \n\n \n\nCompared to a card like Lure of Moria (a 3 cost event targeting all characters of a specific trait with a generically useful effect) it seems similarly useful. But when you really dig into it it's SO much more limited!\n\n \n\nYou have to find it in your discard pile, you need 3 spirit resources (harder to find than 3 Leadership resources most of the time) and in most cases all it will do is give each character a +1 to whatever they're doing. Additional readying effects HELP, of course, but in exchange you lose the utility of setting up effects like We Are Not Idle and A Very Good Tale.\n\n \n\nGreat if you're running Erestor or Cirdan.

I still don't quite have the hang of it, but I just wanted to share my thoughts.\n\n \n\nI love the quest. I think the designers have done a very good job on this one. It's very tough, and it was obviously the intention of the designers to release a difficult quest, so this should not count against it. Even more impressive is that it does not feel unfair, in the sense that nightmare Dol Guldur, Return to Mirkwood, and Amon Din are hard because they are unfair. Possibly because in other quests you can be hit by an unlucky shadow card out of the blue and feel cheated from victory, but here in Carn Dum that is the regular, and you are expected to be ready for it, but also because there are no truly devastating cards, just a very high average card difficulty. \n\n \n\nThis quest certainly inspires deckbuilding, but at the same time doesn't present an easy solution, apart from maybe Hama-Feint, although that strategy is weaker in multiplayer. It seems as if this quest was rigorously playtested, and when someone came up with an idea to beat the quest, they added in some card or effect to hurt it. There have been a few times where I thought I had sealed victory going into the second stage only to remember the Champion's -10 engagement effect too late and I die in a swarm of enemies.\n\n \n\nI have found Loragorn-Frodo-Spirfindel to work pretty well, and doesn't feel as cheesy to me as Hama or Love of Tales. There is also a mono-spirit deck I'm working on that uses West Road Traveller to get rid of the battle and Shadows Give Way to stop shadows, but it still needs work. I look forward to getting in some 2-attempts as well soon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1902538","commentId":1902538,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1448082302,"content":"Whew!  I finally had a 2-handed win against this quest tonight.  I had Boromir (Tactics), Legolas, Gandalf,and on the other side Aragorn (Lore), Thorin, and Imrahil.  \n\n \n\nVictory came because I drew into my 'defensive suite' in my opening hand (Gondorian Shield, Arwen, Song of Wisdom, Burning Brand).  An early Herald of Anorien from the Aragorn deck got Arwen into play early, and by turn 2 Boromir was set up (5 defense, sentinel).  Later got a Warden of Healing to let him keep defending even though Thaurdir was chipping away.\n\n \n\nThe other deck took awhile to heat up, but eventually got Faramir and Sword that was Broken on the table, and a nice little swarm of allies so it could quest for 20+ (a little over 30 on the final round).  It never drew Steward, but it got King Under the Mountain pretty early, which was necessary because it helped me set up A Good Harvest + Desperate Alliance to allow the Boromir deck to continue functioning.  \n\n \n\nGandalf was helpful for accelerating the draw of the tactics deck (by letting me play the top card of the deck), but otherwise none of his toys came out.  On the final round, I quested through stage 2 in one go, took 2 hits from Thaurdir and one from a Werewolf, and then Boromir, Legolas with a Rivendell Blade, Gandalf, and a Vassal of the Windlord got 10 damage onto Thaurdir for the win.\n\n \n\nHappy to be done with that epic string of losses... definitely was more challenged by this quest than any before, but it was never frustrating like Nin in Eilph or some of the other wonky ones.  It's a cool quest, but doubt I'll be revisiting it anytime soon!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1902702","commentId":1902702,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1448112640,"content":"I was thinking along the same lines with both players built around setting up Boromir.

After three quests that were not much of a challenge for solo play (in my opinion at least), it seemed like the Battle of Carn-Dum finally was a quest again that I would not complain about. After this initial impression, I banged my head against it quite a few times with a variety of decks that I usually find fun to play. Like others in this thread, I slowly got the feeling that this quest is unfair and that the encounter deck just has too many tricks up it sleeves. In the past couple of days, I eventually took the time to analyse my defeats in more detail (then became frustrated in between) and finally fine-tuned my deck, so that I can be victorious without feeling too lucky about it.\n\n \n\nMy final verdict on this quest is that it is really great. For the first time since the Nin-in-Eilph, I feel like I was challenged as a deckbuilder and solo player. I am sure the Glaurungs among us dearly appreciate quests like this.\n\n \n\nOn a final note, I did not really plan to come up with a somewhat thematic deck for this quest but I incidentally ended up with Elves and Dunedain: Elrond (solid defender with a Burning Brand, plus extra healing), Loragorn (desperately needed to cope with threat), and Glorfindel (Light of Valinor and Asfalaloth are too useful in this quest to pass on). If people are interested, I will be happy to write up the complete deck and a strategy guide within the next days/weeks. Until then, I hope others (except Seastan, who probably is done with it already) enjoy the challenge as much as I did. =)\n\nEdited November 24, 2015 by tricil"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1910943","commentId":1910943,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1448744325,"content":"I cant remember the last quest i didnt beat on the first or second try.

I am about 6 losses in so far (I think? Maybe more?) and do not imagine my decks will be beating it any time soon. \n\nI think this quest is easily far harder than Lake Town, Dol Guldur, Morgul Vale or Nin-in-Eilph.\n\nInsane amount of threat gain? Check. A Boss enemy that can easily make multiple attacks a turn and starts the game off in staging? Check. Awful Treacheries? Check. Awful enemies? Check. Some downright nightmare location cards? Check. \n\nSome of the worst side quests ever? (Orc Ambush and Furious Charge are both horrid!) Check!\n\n \n\nRight when you think you have things under control something awful happens and you are just screwed. The champion side of Thaurdir is just retarded, -10 engagement cost to all other enemies? Yeah great so even when you stave off his attacks, keep locations under control and have managed to control enemies fairly well by keeping half of them in staging Thaurdir is flipped and all of a sudden every enemy in play is engaging someone! Just the nasty extra attack really wasn't enough and they had to add this -10 engagement to the champion side as well? Overkill.....\n\nCarn Dum Garrison is simply too strong... 3 armour AND five hitpoints? and you start with 2 of them and are bound to have a third appear within a few turns? Crazy. Even the weak enemy, the Orc Grunts or whatever, have surge so they usually surge into some 4 threat location, another enemy or a goddamn sorcery treachery...... they are honestly just as bad as any of the other horrible cards in this quest purely because of surge and the potential to get something so nasty from that surge effect. Oh and they have doomed 1 because there isn't already enough threat gain in this quest..\n\nAnother thing I have noticed is that literally EVERY SINGLE TREACHERY in this quest except for Daechanar's Will which goddamn it, Flips Thaurdir ANYWAY has the sorcery trait...... this is stupid.... only half of them should have this.... essentially every single treachery in the quest does whatever it does on its own AND then deals a shadow card to every single enemy in play OR allows Thaurdir to make an instant attack. Well actually to be honest they do both because even if they trigger the shadow cards effect this is just helping Thaurdir get to 3 shadow cards which then makes him flip and get an extra attack!!!\nThis is way too nuts... \n\n \n\nSome of the shadow effects in this quest are crazy as well and you BETTER NOT be chump blocking or it will be game over VERY quickly but at the same time you do not have ANYWHERE near enough time to set up a super defender considering you could be facing multiple attacks of 5 or 6 attack strength on the first or second turn and the attacks only get worse as the turns go on. \n\n \n\nHonestly most games I was not even able to make it past Accursed Battlefield.... the starting location......\n\nthe amount of threat in staging while you are battle questing on the first few turns is just stupid. \n\n4 from Thaurdir, 4 from the two Carn dum Garrisons because a treachery was revealed and then like 2 to 4 from a location or nasty enemy  so like 10 to 12 first turn (two handed/two player) which would not be so bad if you weren't battle questing and trying to keep back enough characters to at least kill one carn dum garrison considering a werewolf or some other enemy was probably revealed during staging first turn and if not one will definitely appear during the second round and you will get quickly overwhelmed.\n\nHow is this meant to be possible except with the most powerful or most tailor made decks?\n\n \n\nOne particular attempt I double sneak attacked gandalf into play first turn each time doing 4 damage to a carn dum garrison and then was able to finish BOTH off with attacks during the first combat phase. Both Carn Dum Garrisons down and a great start. I also had fantastic other cards and a great hand with the other deck. Pretty sure I conceded on the fourth turn in this game as the encounter deck just INSTANTLY turned my great start into absolutely nothing by just pumping out multiple enemies, multiple locations and multiple attacks from Thaurdir being flipped back and forth and stacking up shadow cards. \n\n \n\nI have to say I am leaning towards agreeing with those who think this quest is too hard and badly designed. I know I am in a small minority but I do not deck build for each quest and am massively a part of the 2 decks to rule them all camp. \nI know that a big part of the game is deck building for quests to find the best way to beat them easily and on a regular basis and to \"solve the puzzle\" but I feel like the designers have done a really good job of balancing the game to a point where you need to deck build for quests UNLESS you have a really powerful all rounder deck that might not stand as much of a chance as a deck tailor made for the quest but you still have a pretty good chance. Even quests like Dol Guldur, Morgul Vale etc can be beaten with a powerful deck that is not built specifically for the quest so long as you persevere or get lucky or have an especially skillful and combotastic game and just manage to pull it off. This is great and means people that like to deck build for quests and people that like to use the same decks consistently are both catered to and can both have fun with their playstyle.\nI feel like this quest does not allow this and you have to be using a seriously mega powerful/broken deck/s or ones that are built specifically for this scenario to stand any sort of chance. I have beaten every quest to date and quite a few of the nightmare quests (up to midway through dwarrowdelf) including Dol Guldur, Morgul Vale, Five Armies and even Ruins of Belegost (with some insane luck!) with more or less the same decks but this quest just laughs at me and spits in my face  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nThis has me worried the game is moving more in a direction (especially with powercreep and everything) where deck building for quests may become something that is not quite as optional and you might not be able to grind out a win without doing so....\n\nIf this really happens it will no longer be a game that is for me. Don't have time to build a new deck from scratch every time I want to play a new quest, just not interested whatsoever. Really hope this is not the case and we continue to see quests that can be beaten with a wide variety of decks. If they want to make quests you HAVE to deck build for they can do that in nightmare... (if they really have to haha). \n\n \n\nI guess 6 or so games isn't really enough to make a judgement so I will stick with it and continue to try and grind out a win but I really don't see it happening.\n\n \n\nI think the main issue is just how quickly it all happens in this quest, even shadow and flame gives you a breather round before its onslaught, deadmans dike starts off brutal but can taper off quite often if enemies slow down etc, once you rescue the captive in dol guldur it gets much easier. In this quest it is hard and fast from the first round to the last round with the potential for game ending treacheries, multiple boss attacks and chain shadow effects on lowly enemies resulting in dead heroes every single turn. Most turns in fact you will have a combination of these things. If you consistently lost on stage 2 or further into the quest it wouldn't be so bad but knowing that you've already lost just a few turns in and having to concede and re set up from scratch is mega frustrating. \n\n \n\nProbably the second biggest issue is the diversity and amount of things the encounter deck can throw at you in this quest. It has:\n-Shadow cards that give extra attacks.\n\n-Shadow cards that make you discard player cards\n\n-Shadow cards that can discard cards from your player deck!!!\n\n-Shadow cards that chain together or can give like +5 attack. (+1 for each shadow card dealt, +1 for each ally defending player controls)\n\n-A location that turns shadow cards with no effect into \"raise your threat by 2\"....\n\n-Enemies that attack out of the combat phase (Thaurdir and the werewolf) \n\n-A Location that heals enemies EVERY TIME they make an attack....\n\n-Encounter deck direct damage (vile affliction) \n\n-Battle keyword on accursed battlefield because there wasn't already enough horrible effects\n\n-A location that raises your threat for every single resource you spend\n\n-The treachery that makes you discard a random card and then search for deck for each other copy of that card and discard them too, imagine this effect making you get rid of every test of will, every hasty stroke, every burning brand, every gandalf....\n\n-Orc Ambush because you know you weren't being overwhelmed or ambushed enough apparently. \n\n-Heavy Curse making all your player cards cost more if there is a copy already in your discard pile\n\n-Orc Grunts shadow effect is just awful, there are already way too many enemies in this quest and so many so quickly that getting this shadow card early on even if it does help you avoid surge is just brutal. the slowing of progress effect is also pretty nasty, especially if you have multiple copies in play... \n\n \n\nLike honestly does the encounter deck want to have any more abilities? It feels like it has a more diverse range of abilities than we do as players!!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1918189","commentId":1918189,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1449198091,"content":"There is nothing inherently wrong with a difficult quest is there?

You also have time to prepare for the big bad boss rather than having him in your face round 1 being a total ******.

The harder a quest is the less variety you can play with.\n\nThen I played Morgul Vale and it kicked my butt so hard I still cringe. I never net deck or use forums to \"solve\" quests. I always want to do it myself. I know other people found the quest pretty easy, but for me it was like the quest had been perfectly designed to counter my style of play, not even sure how. Like others complained about Dul Guldur, but I beat that first try and found it pretty easy. People complained about Into Ithilien, but I played it once, then built a deck to beat it, and that deck I built has like a 90% win rate against the quest (it uses the twins, which I know you like).\n\nBut Morgul Vale was still crushing me after like 30 decks and a hundred tries. It was so freaking frustrating. When I finally did beat it I found out from an official ruling that I had been cheating. I even wrote into Caleb to lobby my case and he told me he appreciated the passion but my wins were invalid. I had to go back and try again. Eventually I mastered the quest, but it took forever. Today, that is still one of my favorites. (If you are curious I was trying to win by moving damage from a bodyguard to final boss using infighting, but Caleb said the damage was still reduced to 1.

I played a couple of my top-tier decks against it and got utterly smashed. I will probably play again at some point, but I honestly don't have the same motivation to keep trying that I did with Into Ithilien. I definitely believe that there is a finely tuned deck that can fair pretty well against this quest (just like there was one for Into Ithilien). I feel like 10+ solo archetypes is an exaggeration, but I don't count your \"first turn remove all encounter cards from the game\" decks since I would never play them (no offense intended, they just only hold interest for me as hypothetical concepts).\n\n \n\nDo you really mean 10 legitimate solo archetypes or was that hyperbole? If you did, would you care to enumerate them? I am very curious to hear your opinion on which decks you think can even somewhat consistently handle this quest. Perhaps I've been unlucky in my play-throughs so far. One game I had a hero death on turn 1 because of surging Sorceries (two Heavy Curses into a Terror of the North) and an immediate attack by Thaurdir (with predictably awful shadow effects). I understand that there are things that I can do to mitigate this, but even as someone who plays nightmare quests this feels a bit extreme. Maybe it is just fatigue with the game, but whereas the losses against Into Ithilien made me want to design a deck to beat it, losses against this quest just make me want to take a break for a while.\n\nEdited December 5, 2015 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1920121","commentId":1920121,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1449319705,"content":"Well, it's hard to have a concept like surge without the occasional bad streak.

You know you're gonna be smashed no matter what you do. Dol Guldur never pretended that it was anything else than a solo killer.\n\n \n\nCarn Dum OTOH gives you the impression that it is beatable. There is only one card that is outright unfair, all the other cards are mean, but not in a sense that you cannot master them. But the fact that every card is a bit harder than usual and that there are almost no cards that can give you a break usually let your games end in a desaster. So Carn Dum is looking more like an unusual big Orc, someone who looks dangerous, but who you think you can beat somehow. You hit at him, he hits back, you hurt him and push him into a corner. But then this Orc suddenly jumps at you with the grace of en elf and fires with various weapons and in a blink of an eye your whole party is dead.

There are so many quests in this game there's room for everyone to be happy.\n\n \n\nThe 'don't play it' is unfortunate because by design an adventure cycle should not be interrupted/skipped. Lake Town has the player go get it on purpose, out of band, to decide to suffer through it. I did! I didn't like it but I don't need to be so disappointed about their decision since it was on purpose a \"challenge\". This is in the cycle, standing in the way (if you want to, obviously, defeat them in order) of the last quest.\n\n \n\nFinally, to your point of 'there is no quest to dominate it'... see, I absolutely want every quest to have me fail it the first few times, until you deck build then it should be a fair fight, a tough fight, but one you can win. Go see me on bgg, over 200 plays, all quests. Eventually, even the hard ones, are conquered. But usually not with 8+ continuous fails. I've come to realize I can only beat this one either by reading someone's combotastic deck (I don't like to do that) or by exploiting the game to the max (elrond-vilya-uber-deck). When it goes too far that way, I feel like I may as well say \"Okay, my heroes now all have +5 defense\" and then sure, I'll beat it.\n\n \n\n I'll still try a few more times (it IS kinda fun to take days off, then come back and try something a little crazy)...  I just want to go on record, as a 200 quest player, not a uber deck builder but an avid one, as a player that has defeated all other cycle adventures, etc.... this one stands out as a bit way too much, with effects that give the player, the \"wtf how unfair is that\" feeling.\n\n \n\nOh, and I'm doing easy mode (only did normal about three times)... and actually, I do suspect this is one of those where easy mode doesn't NECESSARILY make it easier due to the ratio of some cards now having been changed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1943309","commentId":1943309,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1450457199,"content":"I don't have Carn Dum yet, but all this talk about how hard it is makes me all that more excited to open my gifts at Christmas :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1944624","commentId":1944624,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1450500103,"content":"Had a really exciting game using Seastan's ranger deck.

Very stupid, but nonetheless that deck is really good. It's surprisingly not hard to get at least 2 snares really fast, and then off you go. Ever since Leadership became as good if not better at questing as Spirit, and since Lore got many more of these anti-enemy cards, I've thought Leadership-Lore is as good a combination, if not better in some cases, than Spirit-Tactics, at least is solo. Spirit-Tactics is still pretty darn powerful, but getting arguably the best two things in a card game, resources and card draw, can really be better.

That is what they are supposed to do. It is absolutely okay if you lose the quest 20, 30, or 40 times. It just means the quest is hard. This game has been hard since day 1. If you want a cake walk go play Dead Marshes or play a different game or wait a year for the cardpool to expand. But complaining as if FFG has morally offended you is just silly. I don't get it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1948666","commentId":1948666,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1450731027,"content":"I actually haven't gotten a chance to try this quest again, but a friend and i very nearly beat this on our second attempt and we had not done any specific deck building for it.  and we would have won if the last shadow card wasn't what it was.  any other card and it would have been a victory.  \n\n \n\nThat said, I'm glad the quest seems hard and is very challenging.  I'm not glad that it seems others have had to play it 20+ times to get a victory.  But a lot of those that are playing it that many times seems to be OK with that turn out, and - understandably so - are quit proud once they do get their victory. \n\n \n\nA lot of the debate right now is all perspective based though, and while each of us is capable of seeing from the other persons perspective, that doesn't mean it will change our mind about our own thoughts on this quest - or the game in general.  \n\n \n\nI do think that if I had to play a quest 20+ times before I beat it, but know that others have beaten it, then I clearly need to rethink my deck-building ideas and even my game play strategies.  Clearly what I'm doing isn't working.   I wouldn't take this as a fault in the designers. \n\n \n\nAs far as deck building, I do like to build utility decks that can handle a lot of things and use that deck for every quest.  However, I also understand that not every deck idea I make is going to be strong enough to deal with the encounter deck.  You've got to have options and be willing to try completely different ideas.  For example, I've disliked the Dunedain trait for awhile until I saw a deck list that uses Damrod and Forest Snares and even then had to participate in the discussion about why its' OK the Dunedain were relying on traps, making Damrod an excellent fit, before I starting to come around to liking the trait and what it was trying to do.  \n\n \n\nAnyways, I don't think this quest is bad design.  I think this quest fills a much needed spot of being the next go-to quest for a serious challenge.  I've often seen Laketown brought up in this thread, and just thinking of a non-nightmare quest that compares to that is outstanding for me - and several others.  I understand there are plenty of people that dislike the difficulty of this quest.  I'm curious, have any of you tried to quest with the gold ring cards removed?  The designers put those in to have a built-in way of lowering the difficulty of a quest easily and I know several people do this on a regular basis because that is how they would rather play the game.  \n\n \n\nto each their own.\n\nEdited December 21, 2015 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1948900","commentId":1948900,"userName":"zeromage","timestamp":1450737131,"content":"I think if you lose this quest forty times in a row you shouldn't be playing a game that involes deck-building unless you're have someone else make your decks for you (and in that case get second else to make your decks).

I honestly beat the quest with barely breaking a sweat with that deck (and I've lost with other decks to be fair).\n\nPersonally I want some HARDER quests. We have tons of easy quests already, but only a handful which I would say are challenging outside of nightmare and even many of those are easy now. You could spend many many MANY hours playing all of the easy quests in this game and not getting bored. The adventure packs are so cheap, and do repayable even if you lose you're getting your money's worth.\n\nAlso great suggestions already we're posted for playing the game on easy mode."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1949179","commentId":1949179,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1450745655,"content":"Ok I think some people are playing or doing something wrong with this quest big time.\n\nYes I've only had a few more attempts at it but how fast I lose and how quickly it spirals out of control just puts a bad taste in my mouth and stops me from even wanting to make more attempts. I really do think it is horribly designed. \n\nI can accept some people not having that much trouble and certain people overcoming it with particular decks and strategies but I feel like some are just taking it too far. I personally think this is hands down easily the hardest quest to date, inclusive of POD. I think Lake town is far easier than this quest. Same goes for BoFA, shadow and flame, morgul vale etc.\n\n \n\nSorry, but all of the people carrying on about nightmare, do you actually own and play most of the nightmare quests? even the newer ones?\n\nThere are very few nightmare quests I can think of that are harder than this quest and even then they are far more cleverly designed and are difficult because they make you think and present such a different challenge from anything else (for example nightmare druadan forest) and are unique as opposed to being mind numbingly hard and painful.\n\n \n\nPlenty of quests are especially hard. zeromage have you beaten nightmare shadow and flame? nightmare foundations of stone? nightmare encounter at amon din? (this one is an absolute pain fest!) they are all brutal (but at least far more fun and you can get far further before being crushed unlike carn dum) and so are many of the nightmare quests in the heirs of numenor cycle. Plus they are NIGHTMARE quests, specifically designed to be brutal. It really isn't that bad if you rack up 20 losses against a Nightmare quest because you signed yourself up for that. Just trying to beat the second last quest in a cycle should not be like playing one of the hardest nightmare quests....\nHave you got Lake Town and Ruins of Belegost? Both very hard as well.\n\nDo you play with the broken beats-everything and does everything Gandalf hero?\n\nIf you don't play nightmare, don't have these quests or play Gandalf I highly recommend nightmare and those quests and strongly disagree with your opinion that we don't have hard quests out there. There are a whole ton of difficult quests in this game, Nin-in-Eilph, To Catch an Orc, Battle of Five Armies, Dol Guldur etc and any time anyone new gets into the game people are incredibly quick to warn them of just how hard this game can be. It is definitely no walk in the park!\n\nIf you have all these quests and already play nightmare and still think we need harder quests (harder than carn dum, nightmare amon din and ruins of belegost) then you either play with incredibly overpowered decks or are doing something wrong. \n\nI definitely disagree that we need harder quests. Even some saga quests are downright brutal (helms deep and moria/balrog quest forget the name).\n\n \n\nNot everyone is superman Seastan and also not everyone wants to play with broken cheesey gandalf decks. I do believe that a bunch of others have beaten it with specifically tailored decks or some of their stronger decks after a bunch of attempts but some people are taking it a bit far (\"guys this is so easy why cant you beat it, why dont you play easy mode then, we need even harder quests!\") and I feel they are either playing the quest completely incorrectly, are playing easy mode and not mentioning it or just got insanely lucky and won a single game that they would probably not be able to replicate without many many attempts. \n\n \n\nNo it is not impossible or anything but many people play this game differently and quite a lot of people (like me) like to use decks that are strong but not the very top tier and still quite thematic (as opposed to throwing theme out the window and building the strongest and most unthematic deck possible) or like to use the same fairly powerful deck/s for every quest or even like to use decks with a fun or interesting theme (traps, noldor discard mechanic, etc there are so many!). When they build quests that can only really be beaten by top tier decks (except for what seems to be a few exceptions) or by specifically building up decks built just for that one quest I think it is a bit of a disservice to the majority of players of the game. \n\nThis quest in my opinion is definitely the absolute bane of any player that is in the one/two decks to rule them all camp.\n\n \n\nI get that its a deck building game but man, I really don't think there are THAT many of us that build new decks for every single new quest. I know alot of you guys build new decks and change up what decks you are using pretty **** regularly and have several decks at any one time but correct me if I'm wrong, the vast majority of people seem to build multiple decks far far more so to try out different spheres, different heroes, different thematic decks or cool ideas/combos or different traits. I bet there are so few people that build all their different decks based on a certain quest compared to those that build their decks based mainly on a certain idea, line up or trait. \n\nTo get to the point, people deck build to create new decks with cool combos, themes or ideas far far more than people deck build for quests. \n\n \n\nAlso people really need to stop recommending easy mode or asking if people have tried easy mode. I get that for some players this is definitely the answer but not everyone is ok with resorting to that, especially if you have beaten pretty much every other quest the game has ever thrown at you including most nightmare quests, all POD etc without ever having to play easy mode. \n\n \n\nIf Carn Dum sets some sort of trend and we start to regularly get quests this difficult that are not Nightmare, PoD or right at the end of the saga campaign (when we have a million boons and will actually want the quests to be downright brutal because of this and because we will be on the doorstep of Mordor about to finish the saga campaign!) I will definitely stop playing. It is hard enough to find regular time to play a game of this nature that has so many moving parts, so much set up and can take an hour+ to finish a single game at times, especially if you play solo two handed that it will 100% not be worth it if 9 out of 10 games you are just getting absolutely hammered. The game is already hard enough and whats more we have really seen the developers curb back the power creep of player cards lately (making them more fun and combo-y than just straight up powerful) yet encounter cards do seem to still be getting stronger. \n\nEdited December 22, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1949216","commentId":1949216,"userName":"zeromage","timestamp":1450746808,"content":"I've played this game from almost the very first release I'm pretty sure I know how to play.

The Dunland quests, in similar fashion, we're designed to counter a specific style, a style I happen to utilize. All my standard decks lost to those quests, but I just tried a different style and then I beat them. It was challenging and uncomfortable. I don't particularly like those quests, but I certainly don't feel like FFG did something wrong to me personally.\n\nThat is what I don't understand. Like, if you can't beat a quest with the type of deck you want to beat it with, then clearly the game designers did something wrong. It makes no sense. The designers have specifically said that they design the quests to counter player strategies. Isn't that what they are supposed to do?\n\nThe complaining really annoys me because if I beat the quest and don't experiance your \"injustice\" then it must be because I cheated or because I'm using invalid strategies that should basically be considered cheating.

When faced with this evidence, the complainers just double down and act like victims? Get over yourselves. Maybe you just need to keep evolving.

There is a difference between having to use a good deck and having to use one of three or four broken/cheesey decks that have little to no theme at all and rely on some incredibly powerful combo that shuts the encounter deck down. Like for example look at the deck the developers posted alongside the news that this quest is almost out (the twins and arwen). I bet you that deck gets absolutely STOMPED by this quest.

Not that they are particularly hard either but you kind of need to get used to the very unique way the game plays and the various interactions particular effects have and the order in which they resolve etc. \n> \n>  \n> \n> just wanted to add no disrespect or nastiness intended from my posts we clearly just have very different opinions and thoughts on the matter!\n\n \n\nNo disrespect taken from me.  I didn't mean to say this game's rules are simplistic either, I think it's a very rich game, warhammer is just what popped to the top of my head as I'm an avid tabletop gamer, and the rules debates in that game are enough to drive most people away from it.  \n\n \n\nI see your point about Gandalf, but I honestly don't think he's more broken than Boromir, or Dwarf decks, or Outlands, or Tactics Aragorn/Merry.  In fact I think Elrond is a bigger piece of the puzzle than Gandalf.  I haven't seen a really good Gandalf deck without Elrond in it (not saying they don't or can't exist, I just haven't seen one).  While I have seen incredibly powerful Elrond decks without Gandalf.  And in multi-player I don't think I'd even put Gandalf in my top ten most powerful heroes.  He robs other decks of a key card which could very well be a lynchpin for many decks.  Many tactics decks rely on his ally version for threat reduction or card draw, for example.  \n\n \n\nAnd by the way, my one quest that gave me the most headaches is Nîn-in-Eilph.  That quest took me longer than any other one.  Even most nightmares.  I found it to be much harder than Carn Dum.  But I stand by my point that even with that quest you can tailor a deck to specifically beat it.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1950473","commentId":1950473,"userName":"Sin21","timestamp":1450799738,"content":"i appreciate hard quests as they make you think about the game and how you have to approach a certain encounter.

If you gave a player without knowledge the rules for easy mode as well as the cards for nightmare, they would probably name the three modes easy/normal/hard as well. If I could redesign the game I would go with easy (resource + removal of cards), normal (removal of cards), hard (original normal mode) and nightmare (nightmare packs).\n\n \n\nI think one 'easy' quest and one 'super hard' quest per cycle is a good design choice.

The Dunland quests, in similar fashion, we're designed to counter a specific style, a style I happen to utilize. All my standard decks lost to those quests, but I just tried a different style and then I beat them. It was challenging and uncomfortable. I don't particularly like those quests, but I certainly don't feel like FFG did something wrong to me personally.\n> \n> That is what I don't understand. Like, if you can't beat a quest with the type of deck you want to beat it with, then clearly the game designers did something wrong. It makes no sense. The designers have specifically said that they design the quests to counter player strategies. Isn't that what they are supposed to do?\n> \n> The complaining really annoys me because if I beat the quest and don't experiance your \"injustice\" then it must be because I cheated or because I'm using invalid strategies that should basically be considered cheating. I mean give me a break.\n> \n> Many people have beaten the quest, some even beat it easily, using a variety of strategies. The complaints are empirically wrong. When faced with this evidence, the complainers just double down and act like victims? Get over yourselves. Maybe you just need to keep evolving. The designers have no moral obligation to cater to your particular tastes or idea of what counts as a valid approach to deckbuilding. I just don't feel sorrow for you.\n\nAnd a lot of people are complaining that this quest is badly designed, so you better stop doing maths when you clearly have no idea of how statistics work. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nYes, it is possible to beat this quest with combos that are broken, but that's not the sense of deckbuilding. If some people prefer to play with broken decks, it's their particular taste and I don't think the designers should cater that. Get over yourself, play nightmare mode, which is designed for players like you and for those who prefer to make the game a ton easier by using more than one core set.\n\n \n\nIMO the game is going in a totally wrong direction ATM.

The majority are not always correct.

Unfortunatelly none of my three Burning Brands ever appeared thus some shadow and doomed effects raised my threat more than i thought, but yet i won with threat on 49.\n\nLoragorn was a beast with steward of gondor, two blood of numenor, two unexpected courage, sword that was broken and the tactics attachment (edit:I had event written which is wrong offcourse) that you discard a resource to add all other on your attack.\n\nEdited January 1, 2016 by Nickpes"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1967499","commentId":1967499,"userName":"zeromage","timestamp":1451756544,"content":"Cardboard of the rings beat this quest on their new year's stream, with a drunk Brandon as one of the three players.  I guess this quest isn't as hard as we thought.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1967553","commentId":1967553,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1451758402,"content":"> Cardboard of the rings beat this quest on their new year's stream, with a drunk Brandon as one of the three players.  I guess this quest isn't as hard as we thought.  \n\n \n\nDidn't they give themselves one extra starting resource per hero, though?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1967558","commentId":1967558,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1451758611,"content":"> > Cardboard of the rings beat this quest on their new year's stream, with a drunk Brandon as one of the three players.  I guess this quest isn't as hard as we thought.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Didn't they give themselves one extra starting resource per hero, though?\n\nI didn't see it, but that's a huge boost if so."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1967716","commentId":1967716,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1451765839,"content":"They did, they played \"sleazy mode,\" which is easy mode's +1 starting resource per hero but not removing the gold border cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1967938","commentId":1967938,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1451777058,"content":"That is a massive boost.

And even with those points it was a fairly nightmarish slog culminating in a combat round with two or three extra attack shadows, three undefended attacks killing Arwen and Elrond and putting four damage on Glorfindel where discarding a third different card type to the shadow effect would've meant death.

After seeing your post this morning I decided to finally revisit this quest after my first go with at least 10 losses and my second go with no idea how many losses (ball park 4 or 5?) and managed to beat it at last on the second go today (after a restart on turn 3 the first attempt).\n\n \n\nIt was still an immense struggle throughout and I managed to pass 3 player side quests while building up an armada of allies and attachments (Cleared Send for Aid (netting Legolas ally and a Wellinghall Protector), Gather Information and Double Back). Two test of wills were crucial at certain moments as were a few sneak attack Gandalfs and two hardcasted ones as well.\n\nThaurdir is just a dirty rotten ******* and it will be a long time before I revisit this quest, he kept me on my toes all game and a fair few allies fell to his blade... I didn't get sentinel set up on Elrohir all game but managed to get burning brand on Elrond (as well as unexpected courage) and two wardens of healing out eventually so both decks could safely defend against Thaurdir when need be.\n\nOrc Ambush side quest was downright brutal and I picked out the lowliest orc enemies I could find but still struggled against it, I did clear it the turn after it appeared however (probably would have lost if I did not clear it this quickly..).\n\nSo glad I did not get any other nasty encounter side quests and it was hard enough to clear the three player ones.\n\nOnce I got play down to simply Thaurdir in play and whatever would appear each turn (and be cleared within a turn or two at most) I was ready to go to stage 2 and had just finished clearing the third player side quest as well. I got to stage 2 and beat it pretty quickly. I managed to beat it without losing any heroes as well somehow.\n\n \n\nI got extremely lucky in both my player card draws, side quest effects (getting Legolas and the 3 willpower Ent from Send for Aid was incredibly beneficial) encounter draws and even shadow effects and capitalized on this grinding out my eventual first win against this quest.\n\nI made a mistake at one point (not flipping Thaurdir back at the end of the round whilst on stage 1 and dealing an additional shadow to each enemy in play) but noticed before it was irreversible and managed to fix the error and play on.\n\nIt was an incredibly long game and I definitely dragged out how long I was on stage 1 as long as possible.\n\nHappy with the result and glad I can progress past this quest now but still of the opinion it is a crappy quest.\n\nSimply too hard for something that is not at least a nightmare or gencon quest and in a way that is not fun or exciting but just overly punishing, time consuming and annoying. Eager to get my hands on Dread Realm not only for the quest but so that I can stop using proxies of Arwen and Elven Light!\nOh I managed to play Lindir at a point where I had no other cards in hand getting me three cards, that was a random highlight!\n\nEdited January 3, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192169-carn-dum-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=1968450","commentId":1968450,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1451809461,"content":">  \n> \n> > That is a massive boost.

But that quest is very anti-trap while this quest can be won with traps. Basically I tried to get three forest snares out as quick as possible, then used a Burning Branded Aragorn to block Thaurdir, Favor of the Valar to survive quest 2a and basically got the entire encounter deck stuck as shadow cards. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I shudder to think what kind of beastly deck you need to win without such tricks!\n\n \n\nBut wow, there are a LOT of ways you can get crushed here! Even in Solo there are soo many combos! Flippin' Thaurdir! I do play it the right way right? If Thaurdir (captain) has 2 shadow cards, and a card effect causes him to flip, he'll prepare to attack, get a third shadow card, attack, flip back (from receiving the 3rd shadow card), then give himself another shadow card. And if one of his first shadow cards is an Orc Grunts, he'll go down to 2 shadow cards after his attack then when he flips to captain and get's a third one he'll attack again right?\n\n \n\nGood on CotR to win with easy mode!

Granted, a lot of those were brought upon myself, since at the start I was trying to beat it with offbeat decks like an untuned Erestor one. And then I refused to use A Burning Brand for a while. (I have some weird aversion to that particular card.)\n\n \n\nUntil tonight. I sat down and busted out the OP cards: Gandalf/Glorfindel/Galadriel on one hand, Elrond/Lore Faramir/Mirlonde on the other. Wait, Lore Faramir? Well, yes, as has been mentioned a couple of times before, he's actually quite good in this quest with all those high-threat enemies clogging up the staging area. Mirlonde was just for starting threat purposes, as always with her.\n\n \n\nI had a near-ideal start, with the Steward of Gondor/Good Harvest combo AND Light of Valinor AND Shadowfax AND A Test of Will. But of course it soon turned into a desperate slog, including an amazing surge-fest of Heavy Curse, Orc Grunts, Orc Grunts, Orc Grunts (!), Heavy Curse, Angmar Orc. (I politely declined the Angmar Orc's offer of another encounter card.) Through Gandalf shenanigans I would manage to use nearly every single Spirit event at my disposal: A Test of Will x3, Shadows Give Way x3, Hasty Stroke x2, Elrond's Counsel x3. I had the Warden heal about a million damage overall. I got Ethir Swordsman x3 and Nenya out and kept them there. I even perfectly timed my single copy of Mirkwood Pioneer.\n\n \n\nAnd it STILL came down to the wire, every resource gone, full damage on heroes (the live ones, at least, as Mirlonde and Galadriel would fall to Thaurdir in the last round). The only thing that saved me, in fact, was a shadow effect bouncing an enemy back to the staging area, which boosted Faramir juuust enough for this:\n\n \n\n- 1st player declares attack against Thaurdir with Gandalf and Glorfindel for 6ATK, piercing Thaurdir's 4DEF for 2 damage.\n\n- Shadowfax readies Gandalf.\n\n- 2nd player declares attack with Faramir, ally Treebeard, and Shadowfax'ed Gandalf (thank the designers that this cheese works) for 11ATK, getting Thaurdir for the exact 7 more damage needed to kill him.\n\n \n\nThe only other times I've felt so much accomplishment from beating a quest were for Into Ithilien and Helm's Deep.
