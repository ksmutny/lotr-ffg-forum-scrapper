I have really enjoyed this game thus far and it has helped fill my void of Tolkien after finishing all of his works (and his son's). I had a question about the effect of the 'Wrapped' card where a portion of it states \"Attached hero cannot exhaust or ready.\" What if my character I attached it to was already exhausted? For example, I used Beravor's action to draw two more cards before the staging phase. Is it still appropriate to attach to her? And if so, I used her action beforehand so I don't need to reverse it correct?\n\nThe card's full text - When Revealed: The first player attaches Wrapped! to a hero he controls. (Counts as a Tentacle attachment with the text: \"Limit 1 per hero. Attached hero cannot exhaust or ready. At the end of the round, discard attached hero from play. Combat Action: Exhaust a hero you control without a Tentacle attachment to discard Wrapped!.\")\n\n \n\nThanks,\n\nYakazi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309583-card-wrapped-question-the-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=3959535","commentId":3959535,"userName":"Boromore","timestamp":1594141050,"content":"Hi. Yes, you can attach this card to an exhausted hero, as it doesn't say otherwise. Fortuitous that you used Beravor's ability earlier in the round! And no, you don't have to reverse the card draw action."}]}
