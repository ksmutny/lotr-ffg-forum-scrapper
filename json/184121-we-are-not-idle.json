Can you choose to draw the card before you add X resources to a hero's resource pool because it says \"and\" (instead of then, or some other such word indicating an order of operations)?\n\n \n\n2.  Since it uses the word \"and\", if your deck is empty and you cannot fulfill the \"draw 1 card\" are you unable to use the card for resources?  I assume you can still use it since it does not say \"if able\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184121-we-are-not-idle/?do=findComment&comment=1720202","commentId":1720202,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1438719152,"content":"1.

I've been playing it conservatively and have been playing that I must designate resources first.  Then draw a card and realize I should've put the resources elsewhere had I known what I would draw.  It's a small benefit, but one that can definitely matter!"}]}
