In the core set, there was not much value for it, except in conjunction with Northern Tracker or with Stand and Fight to get rid of Brown Lands when they landed to the staging area.\n\nI first began to include it when Prince Imrahil showed up. I thought to get him ready for the cost of 1 and to block any of those unique trolls, now that is great. But it has got even much better still with Ride to Ruin. There are games where I put the guy in four or five times even (I mean different copies of)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54619-snowbourn-scout-ride-to-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=541098","commentId":541098,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1318435266,"content":" Yeah, Rohan is extremely good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54619-snowbourn-scout-ride-to-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=541122","commentId":541122,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1318437922,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nLast night, my wife and I sat down for  to play A Journey to Rhosgobel.  My wife got Ride to Ruin, Snow born Scouts and  Valiant Sacrifice in her opening hand, which allowed her to clear Rhosgobel on the first turn, before we even quested.  I was playing a lore deck with Glorfindel, so was able to start healing Wilyador on the first turn.  It's a potent combination.\n\n\n\n\"Players must defeat stage 1 of the quest before they can journey to Rhosgobel.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54619-snowbourn-scout-ride-to-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=541127","commentId":541127,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1318438769,"content":"Bullroarer Took said:\n\n \n\n\"Players must defeat stage 1 of the quest before they can journey to Rhosgobel.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nYou don't have to travel to it to put progress on it.

I'm totally in love with this card and think it is vastly underrated. Clearing Tower Gates or The Brown Lands when you can't/don't want to travel to them and then chump-blocking with it for a single resource is already great, but with Imrahil, Ride to Ruin and other goodies, it becomes truly awesome. I never play a Leadership deck with less than 3 Snowbourn Scouts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54619-snowbourn-scout-ride-to-ruin/?do=findComment&comment=541314","commentId":541314,"userName":"Eyedunno53","timestamp":1318475492,"content":"I have to agree with the Leadership/Spirit deck wrecking Emyn Muil.  The first time I played it was with one of these decks and I beat it with a final score of 3...

Ride to Ruin is almost too good for it's cost (I know you have to sacrifice somebody, but still). The Riddermark's Finest is another good card to put multiple tokens in a location. With Stand and Fight you can put 4 tokens on a location in one turn. A little more expensive than Snowbourn Scout/Ride to Ruin, but still darn good. And with all the other stuff that Spirit has( Eowyn, Tracker, Mathom, etc) it may very well be the best sphere right now. All it really lacks is a couple of bruisers.   "}]}
