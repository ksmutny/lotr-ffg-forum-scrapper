Sucks big time.....\n\nReally wish it was like MtG and it was released across the world on the same date but that will never happen."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126328-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1322240","commentId":1322240,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1415122071,"content":"> I really feel for the non-USA players, i'm sooo impatient when it comes to getting these cards, the  extra wait would drive me crazy\n\nThat's why I subscribed to Team Covenant. They posted my Nin-in-Eilph from Oklahoma on the 22nd and I received it here in Sweden on the 28th - 6 days later! And there really is no extra wait - since we get every pack at least a few days later than US players, the timespan in-between is about the same. If I'm impatient, I just stay away from the forums and occupy myself with something else."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126328-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1322290","commentId":1322290,"userName":"Djenni","timestamp":1415123904,"content":">  \n> \n> > I really feel for the non-USA players, i'm sooo impatient when it comes to getting these cards, the  extra wait would drive me crazy\n> \n> That's why I subscribed to Team Covenant.

I'm curious since i usually have to wait 2x weeks for my packs and i live in Iceland."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126328-celebrimbors-secret/?do=findComment&comment=1322448","commentId":1322448,"userName":"emusand","timestamp":1415131001,"content":"> That's why I subscribed to Team Covenant.
