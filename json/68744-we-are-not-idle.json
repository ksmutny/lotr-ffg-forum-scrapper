There's no minimum value for X, and nothing to indicate that the card draw is contingent upon adding any particular amount of resources. But I wouldn't be surprised to see an official rules clarification requiring at least one Dwarf to be exhausted (i.e., indicating that the cost is not actually paid unless a non-zero number of Dwarves are exhausted). Feel free to send an email, but the card as printed can just act as a free draw."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68744-we-are-not-idle/?do=findComment&comment=670364","commentId":670364,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1344399751,"content":"starhawk77 said:\n\nrichsabre said:\n\n \n\nseen this on bgg and thought id post here to get some quick input\n\nso the card says exhuast X dwarf characters to add X resources to a heros pool and draw 1 card\n\nthe q. was can X be 0 - in other words just drawing 1 card for no cost\n\nthanks\n\nrich\n\n \n\n \n\nAs written, sure.
