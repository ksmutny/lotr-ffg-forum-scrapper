Great quest, however I think it a first for me to win it in just 3 turns :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] anyway the cutestion is regarding the timing of claiming the Athelas objective card. Not that it really mattered since Wilyador only had 5 damages and I already had an Athelas. But just to clear it out. Quest phase, I have an active location needing 3 progress guarding an Athelas. Quest stage 2B needs 7 more progress. I successfully quest with the result of a total 10 progress points. 3 goes to the location which is explored and the rest goes to the quest which is now complete. Now what happens first? I get to take an action and exhaust a character to claim the objective and them move on to step 3B? I'm pretty sure that's how it should be but I'm not 100% sure. But there is a player window between placing/completing a quest and go on to the next one, right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90021-resolving-order-of-quest-completion-and-claiming-guarded-cards/?do=findComment&comment=860875","commentId":860875,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1378679595,"content":"I think there would be no action window to claim the Athelas.  Like this:\n\n-Progress tokens on the location (location becomes explored, Athelas is now free to be claimed, but no action window yet)\n\n-Remaining progress tokens on the quest\n\n-Quest card is filled up, immediately proceed to card 3 -- no action window\n\n-Resolve text on quest card 3, ending the game\n\n \n\nAnd no chance to claim the Athelas in that sequence of events."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90021-resolving-order-of-quest-completion-and-claiming-guarded-cards/?do=findComment&comment=861063","commentId":861063,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1378706950,"content":"Hm, that's what I expected. I thought otherwise but it's what I expected down deep inside :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] That's about the only thing I find frustrating in this game. The big vast openness in the rules that leaves you to interpret them almost in every situation. Other than that a great game and absolute a \"flaw\" I can live with :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] thanks for clarify it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/90021-resolving-order-of-quest-completion-and-claiming-guarded-cards/?do=findComment&comment=861178","commentId":861178,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1378722715,"content":"The challenge of this quest is partially to quest in a controlled manner in quest phase 2, to avoid getting too quickly to quest phase 3 and the defeat that follows if you´re being too hasty."}]}
