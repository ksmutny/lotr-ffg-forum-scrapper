The shadow effect tells you to resolve the When Revealed effect, but that does not mean the card is \"Revealed\", it is still technically a shadow effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53640-a-test-of-will-and-sacked/?do=findComment&comment=532376","commentId":532376,"userName":"player582283","timestamp":1316822021,"content":"I would play it that I could not counter it with a Test of Will"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53640-a-test-of-will-and-sacked/?do=findComment&comment=532392","commentId":532392,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1316826043,"content":" I would agree with the others.  First off, A Test of Will specifies that it has to be a card revealed from the encounter deck, I don't think that shadow cards are considered revealed from the encounter deck.  Secondly, you'll notice that if you continue to read the When Revealed text on Sacked! that it says it cannot be canceled, so A Test of Will is useless even when Sacked is revealed as a normal treachery card.   You would be better off using Hasty Stroke to cancel the shadow effect, which can be canceled."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53640-a-test-of-will-and-sacked/?do=findComment&comment=532408","commentId":532408,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1316830609,"content":"Kiwina said:\n\nSecondly, you'll notice that if you continue to read the When Revealed text on Sacked! that it says it cannot be canceled, so A Test of Will is useless even when Sacked is revealed as a normal treachery card.\n\n\n\nQuite a bummer that Eleanor too uses the term \"cancel\" with regard to her ability vs \"when revealed\", looks like Miner of the Iron Hills or killing one of the unique Trolls are needed for Sacked."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53640-a-test-of-will-and-sacked/?do=findComment&comment=532828","commentId":532828,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1316954706,"content":"Thanks for everyone who replied.  I missed the \"cannot be canceled\" part in paranthesis when I post the OP."}]}
