It turns out I actually made a huge mistake during that game play: I used Stand and Fight and brought Gandalf in at one point. I had no idea this was not allowed. Thus, that drastically changes the outcome of that game. I may still have won even if I did not do that error, but who knows. I will keep at it and eventually beat this, even if I have given this scenario a go hundreds of times. =p\n\nEdit: REJOICE!! I was going at it again for many hours, and I actually finally beat the quest without any major mistakes, except that I forgot to add 1 damage to an ally at the very end, which has no bearing on the outcome since I won next turn. I will edit the video and upload it to youtube soon. I would even like to even claim it as a \"Speed run\" since I beat it in about 18:25 seconds. A new personal best. =p\n\nEdited August 16, 2017 by StGemma"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/256252-finally-beat-escape-from-dol-guldur-solo-50-cards-core-set-standard-difficulty-progression-play/?do=findComment&comment=2930855","commentId":2930855,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1502920973,"content":"Well done.

I currently have a lot of time on my hands since it is summer break from school. Thus, I have been going at this quest probably hundreds of times over, losing a zillion times in the process of course. Therefore, I know all the cards almost like the back of my hand. =p\n\nAlso, I stick to 50 cards since that is the tournament style. I could certainly have a much higher win rate if I broke that barrier and used a smaller deck since I would get the almighty three attachment combo (Steward of Gondor, Celebrian's stone, Unexpected courage) in my hand more often.\n\nEdited August 18, 2017 by StGemma"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/256252-finally-beat-escape-from-dol-guldur-solo-50-cards-core-set-standard-difficulty-progression-play/?do=findComment&comment=2933118","commentId":2933118,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1503015182,"content":"Yeah, same (regarding sticking to the 50 cards).\n\nAnd like you, I took advantage of an extended period of time off to focus on beating Dol Guldur solo.

Over the years since I first beat it with a combo (so in turn two, probably beat the speed run ^^) but this deck was broke by an errata on love of tales. Since I beat it only with my Gandalf / Elrond / Arwen Undomiel deck (http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/43432) [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/43432], but I heard about beating it with a Caldara deck (near from http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/48903) [http://ringsdb.com/deck/view/48903] and Seastan's Boromir can be also one of the few deck to pass it (http://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/42/seastan-s-boromir-1.0).
