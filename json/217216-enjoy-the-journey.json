The effect isn't bad for 1 cost, but it takes up a Card Slot and doesn't provide repetitive value like allies or Asfaloth.\n\n \n\nSadly I don't think any of this Cards will bring down Northern tracker in a 3 or 4 Player game. There are just so many Locations in Play sooner or later that his value s jsut unbeatable. In Solo or Duo thinks look different though.\n\n \n\n \n\nIt's interesting what they say about Locations. I think the uncharted Locations are very cool and add much more Tension to travelling.\n\nThe ocean Locations on the other Hand don't look that threatening. I was allways happy revealing a Location during that quest instead of something else. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217216-enjoy-the-journey/?do=findComment&comment=2167778","commentId":2167778,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1460565660,"content":"Northern Tracker certainly still seems the best, but you have to be able to afford him.

I don't actually see Glorfindel in many of my 3-4 player games recently, many folks in our community around here seem to be trying some different things recently.  So I see less of Asfaloth, but I still include him in some decks even when Glorfindel is not round (1 progress per turn is still worthwhile, especially if you're combining with other forms of location control).\n\n \n\nI do like each of these cards.  I actually really like the Woodland Courier, though she seems to be getting a mixed reception.  Great target for The Tree People, fits well into a lore/spirit deck, and almost certainly it will be combined with Celeborn in another deck (or in a tri-sphere deck), so I see this as a 1-cost card that has the potential to put 1 point of progress down several times per game (or 2, against many scenarios with Forest locations).  Similar to a Snowbourn Scout without the Theoden cost reduction, after a fashion, but with some actual utility outside of chump blocking (2 willpower, 2 attack on the turn entering play)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217216-enjoy-the-journey/?do=findComment&comment=2167945","commentId":2167945,"userName":"ossderossmane","timestamp":1460571048,"content":"The closest comparable to Hithlain seems to be the Explorer's Almanach.

You guys know she was spoiled ages back right? I ran proxies of it a while ago.... fairly terrible in a non silvan deck but probably works like gangbusters in a silvan deck. Multiple progress placement because of bouncing in and out of play, boosted stats from Celeborn, potentially quest for 2 and then attack for 2 if running Galadriel hero etc.\n\n \n\nMirkwood Explorer is epic!!\n\nYes it takes a while to build up resources on him but if you got him out early game and just kept building resources on him you could take out a nasty location with like 6 or so quest points instantly with him. He is a great counter to that one awful location in each quest that needs to be avoided/explored asap. 2 Willpower combined with this ability is pretty nice too.\n\nThe only crappy thing is that you have to be careful with him as that awful location could appear during a turn you quest with him which means without readying you won't be able to use his ability to clear it until the following turn...\n\nI quite like his art as well, love the pelt cape, long grey hair and headband. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217216-enjoy-the-journey/?do=findComment&comment=2168768","commentId":2168768,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1460610569,"content":"I can't wait to build a \"nuke all the locations\" deck with Idraen at its helm!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/217216-enjoy-the-journey/?do=findComment&comment=2168791","commentId":2168791,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1460613020,"content":"> Mirkwood Explorer is really interesting.
