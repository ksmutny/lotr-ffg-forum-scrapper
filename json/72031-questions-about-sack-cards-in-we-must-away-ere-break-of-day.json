Bilbo Baggins may trigger this effect even with a Sack card attached to him.\")\n\nBilbo Baggins is exhausted when he is sacked (which reads: \"Attached character cannot ready, attack, defend, commit to quests, or trigger effects.\"  So this would be a static situation where Bilbo is not able to remove any sack (as he cannot be readied again to be exhausted to trigger this effect), correct?\n\nAnother related question, Dain Ironfoot has a constant effect which gives +1 boost to attack and willpower to drawf characters when he is ready.  If Dain is sacked, this ability is not canceled because it is not considered triggering an effect, correct?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72031-questions-about-sack-cards-in-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day/?do=findComment&comment=703040","commentId":703040,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1349083481,"content":" Yes                                    "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72031-questions-about-sack-cards-in-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day/?do=findComment&comment=703043","commentId":703043,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1349083757,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n Yes                                    \n\n\n\nThanks Muemakan for the prompt answer.  I take it as \"Yes to both questions\"?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72031-questions-about-sack-cards-in-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day/?do=findComment&comment=703056","commentId":703056,"userName":"JasonRed3","timestamp":1349085288,"content":" I would say yes to both."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72031-questions-about-sack-cards-in-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day/?do=findComment&comment=703058","commentId":703058,"userName":"JasonRed3","timestamp":1349085334,"content":" (assuming Dain is ready when he gets the Sack put on him)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72031-questions-about-sack-cards-in-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day/?do=findComment&comment=703105","commentId":703105,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1349090830,"content":"Oh thank you for the replies.  And yes, Dain is ready, as always, when he is Sacked."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/72031-questions-about-sack-cards-in-we-must-away-ere-break-of-day/?do=findComment&comment=703685","commentId":703685,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1349176725,"content":"I guess \"to trigger effects\" means Actions and Responses.
