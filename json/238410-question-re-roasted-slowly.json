Then, shuffle Roasted Slowly back into the encounter deck.\" This uses the word \"Then\" as a connector between the two sentences, which is addressed in the FAQ:\n\n \n\n \n> (1.15) The word “then”\n> If a card effect uses the word “then,” then the preceding effect must resolve successfully for the subsequent dependent effect to resolve.\n>  \n> \n>  \n\n \n\nSo the question is whether the \"destroy all heroes with (condition)\" effect can be considered to have resolved successfully if no heroes have the given condition. Or, more generally, does the word \"all\" include the number zero, or not? (E.g., does an effect that would discard all event cards from your hand resolve successfully if you had no event cards from your hand? Same question.) I'm pretty sure that at some point there's been an official FFG response to say that the word \"all\" can include the number zero, but I can't find it right now. If I'm right about that, then the first half of Roasted Slowly's effect does resolve successfully even when there are zero sacked heroes, and therefore its second effect will also resolve and it will be reshuffled into the deck.\n \nSo if someone can find that FFG ruling that says that \"all\" can include the number zero, then we'll have resolved this question. Successfully, even.  ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238410-question-re-roasted-slowly/?do=findComment&comment=2566849","commentId":2566849,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1483256952,"content":"Agreed in this case where no heroes are sacked it would go in the discard pile.\n\nA hero would have to be destroyed by roasted slowly in order for roasted slowly to get shuffled back into the deck.\n\nEdited January 1, 2017 by flightmaster101"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/238410-question-re-roasted-slowly/?do=findComment&comment=2566851","commentId":2566851,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1483257378,"content":"Roasted Slowly:: When Revealed: Destroy all heroes with the card 'Sacked!' attached.
