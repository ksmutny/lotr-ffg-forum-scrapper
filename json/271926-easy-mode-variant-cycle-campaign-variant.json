It's meant to serve two purposes:\n\n1) Prevent the frustration of continually losing to the same quest over and over.\n\n2) Create a campaign style mode of play for the deluxes/cycles.\n\nCYCLE CAMPAIGN RULES\n\n1. Start with the first quest in a deluxe box.\n\n2. Play through the 9 quests (3 deluxe + 6 cycle) in order, only moving on when you beat the previous quest.\n\n3. Use the rules from the the Saga campaign regarding your heroes:\n\n * Make a list of all heroes you use on the campaign log.\n * If you beat a quest with one or more heroes in your discard pile, they are added to the fallen heroes list and cannot be used going forward.\n * If you bring in a new hero (whether because one of your heroes died or because you just want to use someone else), add the hero to the campaign log. Then you incur a permanent +1 threat penalty at setup going forward.\n\n4. If you lose a quest (or scoop), the Valar will step in and assist you according to your need:\n\n * If you lost on or before the 5th round, the group gains 2 Grace of the Valar Tokens\n * If you lost after the 5th round, the group gains 1 Grace of the Valar Token\n * Keep track of two numbers in the campaign log:\n   * How many Grace of the Valar Tokens the group currently has.\n   * How many Grace of the Valar Tokens the group earned over the course of the campaign.\n * Redo the same quest.\n\n5. When beginning a quest, immediately after taking or not taking a mulligan, each player may perform the below action X times, where X is how many Grace of the Valar Tokens the group currently has. This does not consume any Grace of the Valar Tokens.\n\n * Action: Draw 1 card or add 1 resource to the resource pool of a hero you control.\n\n6. After beating a quest, reset the number of Grace of the Valar Tokens the group currently has to 0.\n\n7. At the end of the campaign, your total score is the number of Grace of the Valar Tokens the group has earned over the course of the campaign. The lower the score, the better.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nSo the idea here is essentially the Saga rules with an added layer on top that makes it a bit easier to beat a quest if you've just lost against it. If you lasted more than 5 rounds against it, then maybe you just got unlucky and could beat it on the next try, so you're only given 1 Grace token. If you lost quickly, then 1 Grace token might not change the result so much, so you're given 2. Since the total score is dependent on how many Grace tokens you got, and not the number of losses, there is no incentive to sacrifice your heroes off early if you think you aren't going to make it. In fact, it's better for your final score to last into the 6th round then beat it on the next attempt.\n\nWith this mode of play you should never really get stuck on a quest forever. In the worst case you'll eventually have so many Grace tokens you can draw your whole deck and play down every card on the first turn.\n\nWhen you move to the next quest your Grace tokens go away. They are only there to help you through the tough quests in the campaign to save yourself from repeated head-bashing. It also serves as a way to compare decks against each other, to see which ones can get through the campaign with less reliance on the Valar.\n\nThe advantage of this style of play compared to easy mode is that you actually get to play with the full encounter deck as designed. Now, you could combine these rules with easy mode but I don't see the point. You will eventually be given the tools you need to get a win.\n\nFinally, one quirk about the standard Saga rules is that if you lose a hero during a quest, you can simply reset and replay the quest until you beat it without losing a hero. This removes some of the tension in each game because there is no real penalty for doing this. With this mode of play, it will end up impacting your final score.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271926-easy-mode-variant-cycle-campaign-variant/?do=findComment&comment=3256645","commentId":3256645,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1521661029,"content":"I like it.

I think the traditional saga rules unfairly punish Caldara/Folco decks as you say. Boromir has a similar ability, and I think it would feel somewhat unthematic him to come back in the next quest, but I think that's a relatively minor point that can be overlooked for the sake of making these heroes usable in campaign mode.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271926-easy-mode-variant-cycle-campaign-variant/?do=findComment&comment=3269719","commentId":3269719,"userName":"Rajam","timestamp":1522634746,"content":"I began to play the Harad cycle with these rules.

The Crossings of Poros was a tough quest: the first rounds I was barely making any progress (in the very 1st turn I revealed two Desolate Land [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Desolate-Land-CoP]: a location whose threat is equal to the highest number of characters controlled by a single player), and I almost died by threat (reached 48 with the Gandalf-Elrond deck). To make things worse, the side quest which doesn't let me to reduce my threat appeared. Northern Trackers + Rhovanion Outriders were the MVP in this quest, as in round 4 or 5 I could clear all the locations in the staging area and finally was able to make significant progress. Cleared the encounter side quest, triggered the response to reduce my threat by 3, and next turn I cleared Double Back to reduce my threat even further.\n\nDuring stage 2 the encounter set was Mountains of Shadow: the one that increases my threat rapidly. During stage 3 the random chosen set was Desert Creatures. When I reached stage 4, I had to add four extra enemies from the set-aside sets, which joined the Black Serpent and another enemy previously revealed that round. I was fully setup when this happened: Gandalf with Shadowfax, 3 Dúnedain Warning and A Burning Brand, plus Hour of Wrath (credits to the Tactics deck) to make things super easy.\n\nFinal results:\n\n * Campaign log: Arwen Undómiel, Caldara, Círdan the Shipwright, Aragorn, Háma, Mablung, Denethor, Elrond, Gandalf\n * Fallen heroes: none\n * Grace of the Valar tokens earned: 1\n\n---\n\nWith the exception of The Mûmakil, it was the first time I played the quests from the Harad cycle.  It was an... alright cycle. Actually I think this is the cycle I like the least, but that doesn't mean it's a bad cycle or something like that; the story is cool, but some quests were a bit disappointing, and I would've liked even more desert (and desserts :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) and less Orcs. maybe I need to wait for the Nightmare decks before making a final judgment. Dungeons of Cirith Gurat was obnoxious; I don't enjoy quests which drag you around forever. My favorite quests in this cycle were Escape from Umbar, Desert Crossing, The Mûmakil, and Race Across Harad. Mostly The Mûmakil; it was refreshing to fight new types of enemies. Hardest quests were Escape from Umbar and The Long Arm of Mordor, easiest were Desert Crossing and The Mûmakil. Personally I also found The Black Serpent quite easy, maybe I need to try it more times since it's supposed to be DL 8.\n\nI might play a cycle on Nightmare mode next. I'm thinking in Khazad-Dûm because I have played none of the quests in this cycle in NM mode. Don't know yet.\n\nThe Grace of the Valar tokens is a really cool idea. You people should try it and report your results!\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271926-easy-mode-variant-cycle-campaign-variant/?do=findComment&comment=3279552","commentId":3279552,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1523328503,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Rajam said:\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n\nIt's been interesting to hear your progress.

Penalizing scoops by adding to the score definitely brings a new tension to the game.  I encourage others to give this play mode a try! \n\n \n\nStarting Heroes: Thorin, Ori, Dain; Nori, Gandalf, Gimli http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/4431/sellswords-miners [http://ringsdb.com/fellowship/view/4431/sellswords-miners](I’ve made a few modifications since this was posted, but just some fine tuning)\n\nValar Earned: 15\n\nFallen Hero List: Nori, Gandalf, Dwalin\n\n \n\nInto The Pit\n\nValar Earned - 0\n\nFallen Hero List - None\n\nNotes - Threat for both teams was 48.  So no surprise that 3x Signs of Conflict boosting threat a total of 6 for both sides nearly defeated the fellowship. Dark and Dreadful also kept thinning the pack of dwarves. No locations or enemies were of concern.\n\n \n\nThe Seventh Level\n\nValar Earned - 0\n\nFallen Hero List - Nori (Replaced with Dwalin)\n\nNotes - Undisturbed Bones shadow took out Nori. Cave Troll came out in setup and Chieftan of the Pit came out in the second round. Had to engage both immediately, but managed the win.\n\n \n\nFlight From Moria\n\nValar Earned - 0\n\nFallen Hero List - none\n\nNotes - VP up to 7, but no A Foe Beyond drawn. Had Dain and Gimli with Citadel Plates just in case!\n\n \n\nThe Redhorn Gate\n\nValar Earned - 2\n\nFallen Hero List - none\n\nNotes - First scoop resulted when Avalanche led to three undefended attacks and one lost hero in the second round. Played a second time with no Valar and won it handily.\n\n \n\nRoad to Rivendell\n\nValar Earned - 0\n\nFallen Hero List - none\n\nNotes - Orc Ambush actually helped pull a Goblin Archer out of the staging area. The second Orc Ambush only pulled down one orc enemy, so the one card that can wreck about any deck had minimal impact.  Shadow effects can kill Arwen here, but only one did damage to her.  I was holding my breath on about 5 attacks after that.\n\n \n\nWatcher in the Water\n\nValar Earned - 5\n\nFallen Hero List - none\n\nNotes - 1st game earned me two Valar when SETUP produced 3 locations and three enemies. 2nd game earned me one Valar when I threated out trying to open the door.  3rd game ended early with a Wrapped tentacle taking Dain under the sea. I had such good opening hands I did not use the Valar points for those three games. Then I decided to curb stomp the quest and gave out one extra resource to five heroes.  Longbeard Elder scried the encounter deck and had the right card to discard for the win.\n\n \n\nThe Long Dark\n\nValar Earned - 2\n\nFallen Hero List - none\n\nNotes - Played the 1st game wrong and counted that as a scoop.  Forgot to add threat to locations.  Would have activated all lost keywords and bad things would have happened. 2nd playthrough was unremarkable.\n\n \n\nFoundations of Stone\n\nValar Earned - 2\n\nFallen Hero List - none\n\nNotes - 1st lost was due to two bats and no ranged.  Undefended attacks finally caught up to me.  Gandalf finally got Shadowfax but fell to a bat swinging for 6 (3 other enemies and a shadow boosting +2). Bats again wrecked heroes on the second try.\n\n \n\nShadow and Flame\n\nValar Earned - 4\n\nFallen Hero List - Gandalf, Dwalin\n\nNotes - Heroes all exhausted in an attempt to push the Balrog into the pit but came up short by 3 card cost for a first game lost. 2nd and 3rd losses failed to come up with enough chump blockers.  Missing Nori right about now!  Lost some heroes in the final win, but it’s the last game of the campaign, so while sad, no further ramifications.\n\nEdited April 22, 2018 by Denison"}]}
