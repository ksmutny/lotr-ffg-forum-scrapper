Boy, that was a mistake I think, cause it looks like this will be eating a lot of time as well in the future...\n\nIt's already sometimes hard to find enough time for all the great games out there. Currently I'm also buying all Thunderstone and Nightfall expansions as well, but LOTR is my top priority when it comes to bringing the new stuff to the table.\n\nSo keeping up with the output of the Adventure packs can be difficult at times, but then again: We usually have to wait a bit longer than most players in the US, so that gives my playgroup enough time to beat the quests several times...\n\nWhat I'm more worried about right now is the amount of cards that never get played. I mean my gf and I have our two decks (Leadership/Lore and Spirit/Tactics) and we tinker a bit with them, but never really get to try out all the new player cards... which is a shame in my opinion."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56874-anyone-else-finding-it-hard-to-keep-up/?do=findComment&comment=561294","commentId":561294,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1322501096,"content":"Untergeher said:\n\nWhat I'm more worried about right now is the amount of cards that never get played.

I suppose if I lose one fast and early, might play two plays, but that's the limit as then each of my four decks have been in action and seeing the same deck twice in one day is too boring to consider playing again."}]}
