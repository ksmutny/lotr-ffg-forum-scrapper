In order to add a resource, there must be a +1 total count in resources (i.e. I play Wealth of Gondor to add a resource to Boromir’s resource pool increasing my total resource count by +1)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191248-it-never-occured-to-me-before/?do=findComment&comment=1848494","commentId":1848494,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1444850219,"content":"Come here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183614-125-collecting-adding-moving-and-gaining-resources/?hl=%2B1.25+%2Bcollecting%2C+%2Badding%2C+%2Bmoving%2C+%2Bgaining+%2Bresources] for more questions about (1.25) Collecting, Adding, Moving, and Gaining Resources.\n\nEdited October 14, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191248-it-never-occured-to-me-before/?do=findComment&comment=1848502","commentId":1848502,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1444850401,"content":"-\n\nEdited October 14, 2015 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191248-it-never-occured-to-me-before/?do=findComment&comment=1848708","commentId":1848708,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1444856147,"content":"From the text of Heir of Mardil, as soon as you add resources from a card effect, you ready the hero.
