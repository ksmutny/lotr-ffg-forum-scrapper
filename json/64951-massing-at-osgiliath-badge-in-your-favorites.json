I didn't even touch that one at all. It appears FFG removed Massing from Collections completely.\n\nSo basically, take this as a warning and don't update your Top 5 or possibly even your collection at all if you don't want to lose it.\n\n \n\nAshame really, as I was hoping for the possibility of someday being able to fill all five slots with LotR LCG badges. sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64951-massing-at-osgiliath-badge-in-your-favorites/?do=findComment&comment=634623","commentId":634623,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1337703126,"content":"shame….what they should have done is deleted that **** pointless sub forum…i will never get why that was created…."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64951-massing-at-osgiliath-badge-in-your-favorites/?do=findComment&comment=634635","commentId":634635,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1337704169,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nshame….what they should have done is deleted that **** pointless sub forum…i will never get why that was created….\n\n\n\nYeah. I sometimes forget to click on the other subforums, though I still will occasionally as I think they merit existence, but not that one.\n\nWeird that they kept that but ditched it from 'Collections'."}]}
