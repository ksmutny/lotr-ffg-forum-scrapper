I hate this scenario so much for it's lame mechanics and ridiculous solution to hurting players...\"Let's just deal two damage to everything with this card, that'll stop em.\" Well it certainly does do that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54576-rockslide-is-absurd/?do=findComment&comment=540569","commentId":540569,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1318357762,"content":" Sorry for posting this twice guys, accidental."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54576-rockslide-is-absurd/?do=findComment&comment=540687","commentId":540687,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1318376427,"content":"The solution is simple, do not quest with everyone.
