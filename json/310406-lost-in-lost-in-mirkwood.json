But there aren't any set aside cards!?\n\nI must be missing something. What did I do wrong?\n\nÂ \n\nEDIT: Is this connected to the \"if able\" in \"travel to the next A stage, if able.\"? Do I travel to the next C stage (4c) instead!?\n\nEdited August 10 by steve83"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310406-lost-in-lost-in-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=3972771","commentId":3972771,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1597105633,"content":"If you're on stage 2A, the next stage C should be 3C, not 2C."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/310406-lost-in-lost-in-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=3972882","commentId":3972882,"userName":"steve83","timestamp":1597134594,"content":"Ugh! That's what I get for playing through blind! ðŸ™„\n\n2C is literally the next C stage after 2A. But reading through all the quest cards, it is now obvious that the intention is to progress numerically, and then select either A or C.Â  (And the final objective location is therefore superfluous.)\n\nEDIT: Seems I'm not the only one [https://amp.reddit.com/r/lotrlcg/comments/8uovo9/haldan/] to make this mistake.
