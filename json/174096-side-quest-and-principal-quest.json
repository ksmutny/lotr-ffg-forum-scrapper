I am questing using Attack power because Ambush in Ithilien has Battle, even though Gather Information does not have battle.\n2.  I draw Watcher in the Wood as my staging card.   Its effects take place,  but Watcher in the Wood does not gain surge because Gather Information does not have battle,  even though we are still questing with attack power.\n3. Questing resolves, Southron Company counts as 1 threat because the current quest does not have battle.  I make some quest progress, but lets say not enough to clear Gather Information, so it is still in the staging area.\n4.  I engage Southron Company.   Since side quests are only the active quest until the end of the questing phase, and it is now the combat phase,  Southron Company has 5 attack value.\n\nall these circumstances will all be repeated next turn of course, until Gather Information is cleared.  Am  I right about this?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174096-side-quest-and-principal-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1593985","commentId":1593985,"userName":"tricil","timestamp":1430054905,"content":"awp832: If you look at the definitions of Battle, Siege and Defense, you will find an obvious answer. Namely, the keyword only counts for \"characters committed to that quest\" (the one with the keyword). Since the active quest is selected at the *beginning* of the quest phase, you only commit characters to the chosen side quest (you got points 1 and 2 incorrect) and the keyword of any non-selected quest does not matter for the remainder of the quest phase (you got point 3 correct). Outside of the quest phase, only the main quest matters (you got point 4 correct).\n\nEdited April 26, 2015 by tricil"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174096-side-quest-and-principal-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1594184","commentId":1594184,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1430067006,"content":"I made the same mistake, but a quick look at the definitions of Siege and Battle revealed what tricil mentioned: they only apply to the quest card on which they are written."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/174096-side-quest-and-principal-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1594559","commentId":1594559,"userName":"awp832","timestamp":1430090334,"content":"ok cool, that makes play a bit easier.  ty."}]}
