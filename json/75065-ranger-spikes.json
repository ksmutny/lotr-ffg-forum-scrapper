A player can never remove an attachment at will, if the attachment's card text doesn't explictly say so (or of the text of another card alllows it). For example, you cannot remove Light of Valinor from Glorfindel to put it on Elrond, but you can do the same with Dúnedain Mark, because the latter's card text allows it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75065-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=775054","commentId":775054,"userName":"Rashley","timestamp":1363582786,"content":"Beast Rabban brought up some interesting points about attaching 'Ranger Spikes'.  Well spotted!  Read his reply.  Cheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75065-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=781914","commentId":781914,"userName":"Zadom","timestamp":1365204970,"content":"Another question about Ranger Spikes.  If an enemie is attached to ranger spikes in the staging area can you voluntarily engage that enemy?  My example is from Return to Mirkwood where Attercop Attercop was attached to Ranger Spikes but I can't clear the last stage of the quest if enemies are in play so I engaged it and killed it.  Was that correct?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75065-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=782040","commentId":782040,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1365244454,"content":"Yes, you can voluntarily engage enemies with ranger spikes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75065-ranger-spikes/?do=findComment&comment=782202","commentId":782202,"userName":"Zadom","timestamp":1365288150,"content":"Thanks Grandspleen.  Man, I love Ranger Spikes!"}]}
