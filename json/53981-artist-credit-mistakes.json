However, you then used the same piece of artwork on River Langflood (CatC 44) and credit Marco Caradonna with the art. I believe the correct artist is Caradonna.\n\nThe next mix-up is with the Witch-King. On the card you credit Igor Kieryluk as the artist when Aaron Miller is actually the artist (as per his website: www.aaronbmiller.com [http://www.aaronbmiller.com])\n\nJust wanted to make sure the correct artists got their due credit.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53981-artist-credit-mistakes/?do=findComment&comment=535302","commentId":535302,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1317405600,"content":"Guess this is a card for Return to Mirkwood from the same artist (even though he says it has been painted for Hunt for Gollum)\n\nhttp://www.aaronbmiller.com/attercop-lord-of-the-rings-lcg/ [http://www.aaronbmiller.com/attercop-lord-of-the-rings-lcg/]"}]}
