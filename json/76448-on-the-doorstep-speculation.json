Probably with a low threat, but a negative rule (How about Force: draw an additional card from the encounter deck - if that's too harsh, you could make it Force: draw an additional card from the encounter deck, if its an enemy put it into play, otherwise discard it). In return he should have -2 threat. Threat 6: Stats like 2, 1, 1, 4.\n\n \n\nI think he should be a hero because he's one of the most iconic of the dwarfes and probably has the most \"screen time\".  The rule obviously reflects his blundering attracting more attention, and he isn't that fat at this point. \n\nHowever I could even see him as 1, 0, 0, 5 (with a total cost of 4 threat), I think he was a bit more balanced in the hobit though, so i think my initial stats were better. I would make him Spirit probably, which is a shame because I think they're the one sphere  that doesn't need more low threat guys.\n\nI just can't see him as leadership or lore.
