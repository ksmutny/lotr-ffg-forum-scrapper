What we can hope for is to see a great variety amongst those decks.\n\nUntil they start putting more and more restrictions in the scenarios construction (ex: lower the maximum treat, force the use of only 2 or 1 hero, etc.), we'll keep seeing scenarios following regular patterns. The basic rule is still to quest, defend and attack. And as expansions are released, players will have access to more and more cards to allow them to perform those functions.\n\nPlayer versatility will keep on increasing much faster than scenario complexity or strategy, I believe. We've seen it with the release of the songs (everyone can have access to the best hero abilities while still playing the best cards from each sphere). Certain scenarios require specific skills or cards (Journey to Rhosgopel comes to mind); as of right now, that scenario is very difficult without Tactics and/or Lore. But as they'll release more cards with Ranged in various Spheres, it'll reduce the difficulty of the scenario. Who's to say we won't see a healing implement in a different sphere eventualy. As those \"versatile\" cards become common staples in future decks, more and more scenarios (from the past) will become easier."}]}
