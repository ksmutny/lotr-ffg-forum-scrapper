Just put them in the your deck. You can also go above 50 ( although decks this big tend to have a problem with card draw). You can also make decks with as many cards as you like because the 50 cards rule is not mandatory if you just play casual games. \n\n2. They add together. You can for instance even put 2 tokens on a quest with Legolas and if if this will finish the card....put one additional token on the next card with the blade.\n\n3. If you want to start with a really low threat........Normally it doesn´t make a lot of sense because then you only get to resources."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58052-just-started/?do=findComment&comment=571606","commentId":571606,"userName":"Emrad","timestamp":1324972207,"content":"The only valid reason to pick a 1- or 2-hero deck is to have a lower initial threat. This could work very well if you play a Leadership deck and get Steward of Gondor quickly enough to get 3 resources as a normal deck would have. This might be interesting to test in Solo I guess..."}]}
