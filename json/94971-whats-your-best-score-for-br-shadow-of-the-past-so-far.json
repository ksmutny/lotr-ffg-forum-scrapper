You lack both the resources and card draw. Keeping Eowyn ready costs you one spirit resource each round. So how do you play card like The Galadhrim's Greeting? If your result was 60, you must have played that card multiple times. Also, why do you suggest to give the readying attachments only to the spirit player? The lore player also needs some, in case he faces a hide test.\n\n \n\nAll this makes it likely that some rule errors happened."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94971-whats-your-best-score-for-br-shadow-of-the-past-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=933307","commentId":933307,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1387351406,"content":"From the rule book:\n\n\"Players can discuss anything they would like, but they cannot name or read out loud directly from cards in their hand, or from cards that they have seen but the rest of the players have not.\"\n \nThe simple act of playing two-handed excludes you from being able to observe this rule in any kind of manner that matters.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nNow in regards to the decks themselves:\nYes congratulations, some very good scores can be accomplished with these decks. As long as you make certain that team Glorfindel is first player and that the quest dependant hide tests are done with this team (having multiple unexhausting effects for hide tests as you mention)\n \nMy gripe with this has already been hinted at and certainly has not changed after having tried my first ever game playing two-handed: this game is ridiculously easy when you can see both hands at the same time as opposed to playing with a friend. Normally when I play, even if we make up a strategy in advance, I have to try and consider what my co-player may be having in his hand. This is obviously not so without a co-player.\n\nThis advantage was apparent from round one where team Bilbo could play an elf-stone to help team Glorfindel put a Gandalf in play. A play that would have made no sense making if not for the fact that I could see both hands.\n\nRound 2: oh I see team Glorfindel has a renewed friendship. Therefore it makes more sense for me to play an attachment on Sam Gamgee and then get my threat lowered to 20, thus making me able to play Risk Some Light.\n\nAnd it just goes on and on. I could play no cards without considering everything in both players´ hands.\n\n \n\nIn the end, even if I \"won\" with a better score than before (which I shall not put in the quest-log; a first for me), it was the most excruciating LotR experience I have ever had. The game simply isn´t fun for me playing two-handed (and that is the only reason the low scores work) when I´m used to a partner as we meet the challenges in a team-environment.\n\n \n\nTo conclude:\n\nSure if you like playing two-handed then by all means do it.\n\nIf, at the same time, you expect me to credit you for making a low score then you are out of luck.\n\nHaving tried two-handed now for the first time, and finding it even more easy (also boring) than I had anticipated, I cannot get myself to acknowledge any kind of recorded score from this kind of play.\n\nBut to me, skill in this game comes from how you react to the unexpected and adapt as you play. Eliminating this aspect, simply kills the fun.\n\nEdited December 18, 2013 by Nerdmeister"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94971-whats-your-best-score-for-br-shadow-of-the-past-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=933318","commentId":933318,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1387352375,"content":"Quoting the obscenely poorly-worded \"table talk\" rule is kind of grasping at straws.\n\n \n\nIf you are interested in playing \"by the rules\" you will recognize that nothing in the entire game manual prevents you from showing your entire hand to the other players -- so long as you don't read aloud from the cards.  If you are interested in playing in the \"spirit of the rules\" then you've got a whole different discussion on your hands."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94971-whats-your-best-score-for-br-shadow-of-the-past-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=933325","commentId":933325,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1387354223,"content":"> Quoting the obscenely poorly-worded \"table talk\" rule is kind of grasping at straws.\n> \n>  \n> \n> If you are interested in playing \"by the rules\" you will recognize that nothing in the entire game manual prevents you from showing your entire hand to the other players -- so long as you don't read aloud from the cards.  If you are interested in playing in the \"spirit of the rules\" then you've got a whole different discussion on your hands.\n\nI must disagree on this.\n\nThe game is a whole other experience in terms of difficulty when choosing to not observe the table talk rules.\n\nSaying that it makes no difference if you play with or without those rules is an illusion at best.\n\n \n\nYou can certainly choose to ignore the rule and say \"well that´s just a minor thing anyway\".\n\nThough I´m wondering if the rule would be ignored in a tournament environment?\n\n \n\nThe point isn´t if you play the game as you prefer.

What cards did you change? After having a 17:5 streak, I replaced cost-effective cards like Silvan refugee and Escort from Edoras with Elrond’s counsel and Galadhrim’s greeting to reach better scores (use it in last round only if you have the resources available), but of course the deck is safer with more will power. Depends on what you aim at.\n\n \n\nTypically, you are in possession of encounter deck control cards at the beginning of turn 2 the latest, meaning either you know what’s coming at you or you have to reveal only one card. So usually, you only get into trouble if during the quest phase, you face multiple cards of: The ring draws them, Hunting for the ring, Crawling towards them, maybe Black rider. Player 1 is always almost able to pass hide tests, and usually there are only one or two rounds in which player 2 is the starting player and can be hit by Crawling towards him.\n\n \n\nAdditionally, if you preserve the ring only for cards that could put a hide test on the lore player and for The ring draws them, you should be fine. On the other hand, every possible deck can be defeated by an unlucky number of hide tests, but in my games, the encounter deck was hardly ever able to put an unwanted hide test on player 2, just because there are so many ways to prevent that (e.g. Re-arranging cards, Lampwright, optionally engaging a nazgul because you know Rode like a gale/Hunting for the ring is coming etc).\n\n \n\nAs I said, accumulating quest points should be no problem if you use readying effects/Eowyn’s ability/attachments like Protector of Lorien to the max. Even in round 3, which is often critical because of a combined hide 2/hide 3 test, it should be possible to reserve enough will power to safely pass it.\n\nIn the round with score 60, I remember there was no Galadhrim’s Greeting, but Useful knowledge twice (which reduced threat by 6 after re-arranging encounter cards so that I put a Nazgul on top) plus Elrond’s counsel, Renewed friendship and Gandalf.\n\n \n\nIf I find the time, I will post the result of the 2 rounds I am going to play later today."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94971-whats-your-best-score-for-br-shadow-of-the-past-so-far/?do=findComment&comment=934363","commentId":934363,"userName":"Figo3434","timestamp":1387470838,"content":"Those are the two games I played last night with the decks.\n\nOpening draw first player: Galadhrim’s greeting, Errand Rider, Riddermark’s finest, Celebrian’s stone.

This is especially true because having more players by itself does not give an advantage, especially for some scenarios, where it actually makes it more challenging.\n\n \n\nPersonally, I enjoy two-handed play not because it makes things easier but because it opens up more creative deck building options and combo possibilities.
