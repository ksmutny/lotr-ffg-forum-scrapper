The extra language in the FAQ that reads: “If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able to declare attacks against enemies with which he is not engaged, he is still only permitted a single attack against each of these enemies” is there because the core rules insert does not address the issues of ranged attacks.

That was because the way the core rules were written the restriction only applied to enemies engaged with you. Entry 1.11 should NOT be interpreted as limiting all additional methods of declaring attacks, such as Quick Strike, Hands Upon the Bow, Great Yew Bow or Haldir. Those methods are card effects that generate attacks and are thus exempt from the rule that limits the number of attacks granted by the core game rules and FAQ.\nThat leads us into your first question: Hobbit-sense prevents enemies engaged with you from making attacks granted by the Resolve Enemy Attacks step of the combat phase, and it prevents you from making attacks granted by the Attacking Enemies step. It does not prevent you from using those other card effects I mentioned. Those cards generate attacks but they do not technically “declare attacks” as described in the rules because they skip skip the declaration of attack and step 1 of Attacking Enemies by having you choose an enemy target and telling you which character to exhaust. \nCheers,\nCaleb\n\n-------------------\n\n \n\nSo: the 'once per round' rule applies only to attacks declared through the normal framework (which includes Ranged attacks).  Any card effect granting an 'extra' attack will not consume your 'once per round' declaration limit.  So you can attack an enemy in the staging area via your normal attack with Dunhere, then follow-up with a second attack using Haldir's ability.  \n\n \n\nAnd, Hobbit-sense doesn't prevent you from attacking enemies via card effects."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1260915","commentId":1260915,"userName":"DaeMord","timestamp":1410620701,"content":"> Those cards generate attacks but they do not technically “declare attacks” as described in the rules because they skip skip the declaration of attack and step 1 of Attacking Enemies by having you choose an enemy target and telling you which character to exhaust. \n> \n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n\n \n\n \n\n> This is different from Quick Strike (Core 35), which targets a character and allows them to perform a normal attack, which is a framework effect\n> \n>  \n\n \n\n \n\nAt the risk of being picky, dont these 2 directly contradict each other?\n\nEdited September 13, 2014 by DaeMord"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1260933","commentId":1260933,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1410621533,"content":"No. The second one refere to immunity, not to additional declaration of attack.\n\nIt does seem that way when you read them out of context, but you shouldn't read them out of context."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1260980","commentId":1260980,"userName":"DaeMord","timestamp":1410623471,"content":"actually i disagree, these 2 subjects overlap if an extra attack is not a framework effect, then quickstrike should not be able to be used against imune to player card effect mobs, however if it is a framework effect then you should not be able to be used in the way defined above.\n\n \n\nQuick strike in the faq was specificly defined to target the hero card and then do an attack using framework effects, in order that it could be used against mobs who are imune to player card effects, the wording above from caleb would suggest that actually quickstrike targets the mob in question thus should be effected by things that prevent non framework effects from happening\n\n \n\nThe 2 rulings are in contradiction, either it produces a framework effect and targets the hero, or it doesnt and targets the mob, but then cannot be used against immune to player card effects\n\n \n\nthis effects anything doing anything like this, and tbh shouldnt be seen to be doing both because if it is targeting the mob, but bypassing imunity, this raises questions about what is a \"framework effect\" and once again raises \"immunity to player card effects\" as a somewhat confusing and ildefined ruling"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1261083","commentId":1261083,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1410628659,"content":"Immunity rules are weird, and I could not prove you wrong.
