So it always has higher priority. Next to that other players can always declare ranged attacks on the enemies engaged with you, you just cannot participate in those attacks yourself.\n\nWhat you can do, is use \"Quick Strike\" in any phase but the combat phase. For Example, you use \"Quick Strike\" in \"encounter phase\" or \"refresh phase\".\n\n \n\nGrtz, Jban\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1244147","commentId":1244147,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1409685238,"content":"And here's the answer :\n\n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> The limitations on attacks has to do with the number of attacks the game itself grants each player against an enemy each round. The extra language in the FAQ that reads: “If, through card effects such as ranged, a player is able to declare attacks against enemies with which he is not engaged, he is still only permitted a single attack against each of these enemies” is there because the core rules insert does not address the issues of ranged attacks. It simply reads: “A player has the opportunity to declare 1 attack against each enemy with which he is engaged.” So FAQ item 1.11 is meant to clarify that you are also limited to 1 attack against enemies you are not engaged with.\n> But again, those are attacks made via the Attacking Enemies step of the combat phase. Card effects such as Quick Strike and Haldir are special abilities that grant attacks in addition to the normal attacks granted by the combat phase. That means you can use Quick Strike to attack an enemy that you have already attacked that phase.\n\n \n\nMaybe I should ask for GrandSpleen's question too, because it was not an answer about player declaring or character declaring.\n\nI would say you cannot use extra attack's cards when playing Hobbit Sense however."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1244162","commentId":1244162,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1409685551,"content":"Good to read.\n\nThanks for asking Alogos.\n\nHaldir thus keeps his high value with his ability :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114445-haldir-and-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=1244405","commentId":1244405,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1409692491,"content":"Thanks for that Alogos!  Surprised at the response but I always like the responses that make us stronger :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
