There I was really bothered by Denethor's plain madness (as opposed to its colourful description in the books), Army of the Dead taking away much of the previous heroism of the Battle on the Pellenor Fields, or indeed the absence of Tom Bombadil and especially Gildor and Glorfindel. But I understand the immense difficulty of such adaptation -- or can imagine parts of it. In a similar sense, I really wish there was less Legolas (though I liked him a lot) in the Hobbit, and more Beorn (though there is not much more of him in the book itself), especially him getting rid of Bolg, for instance. And I wish the whole thing was a bit darker, more in the style of the Fellowship of the Ring, which I too find the best of the six movies. But I am so grateful I could experience these on the big screen.

In general, I like almost all the deviations from the book in theory but thought the excecution was often terrible. A dwarf-elf romance? Sure why not, just look at how Gimli and Galadriel interacted or read the Beren and Luthien part of the Silmarilion and write something similar. Instead they wrote something about Kili's *****. No human could have written that scene and thought it was acceptable so I suspect they used a Hollywood automated-script-writer.\n\n \n\nBut I like a lot of the world-building they did, especially with the extended scenes.

The studio wanted a PG-13 fantasy action trilogy to sell tickets to the lucrative, younger-skewing action crowd. And Peter Jackson (and, I think, a large portion of the original trilogy's fans) wanted a thematic and tonal prequel to Jackson’s previous Lord of the Rings films.\n\n \n\nAnd in trying to be all of those things, the films didn’t quite succeed on being any of them. The movies were too long and too focused on world-building (the stirring of the enemy and the set-up for the War of the Ring, Legolas and the politics of the elves and dwarves, the corruption of Saruman, etc) to be a light and breezy adventure tale and yet still maintained too much of that zaniness to be a serious LotRs prequel in tone. Action scenes dragged on ad nauseam to further clutter the run-time and little time was found for quieter moments between the characters (partially do to added plot-lines—like the romance--likely included to pad out a three-movie release). And that is before we even talk about the action-scene composition that was clearly meant for 3D viewing and is terrible in every single movie that does it. Case in point: the barrel scene.\n\n \n\nIt was a mess.\n\n \n\nThat doesn’t mean there wasn’t a lot of good in the movies. As someone who is not a particular Tolkeen fan, I didn’t mind the diversion from the main plot of the hobbit to further the world-building and I found a lot of it interesting (it just didn’t fit the tone/pacing of the rest of the movie). Some of the special effects were also very well done (though the abandonment of practical effects for things like the orcs and goblins was stupid). And Bilbo and several of the company were wonderfully cast.\n\n \n\nBut as a whole…I just don’t think it works too well. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197251-peter-jacksons-the-dwarf/?do=findComment&comment=1973019","commentId":1973019,"userName":"Mich the One","timestamp":1452015632,"content":"Huge disappointment for me.

Not because there couldn't be a good, compelling love story fit into this movie--there absolutely could have been. But because as written the romance follows the worst, most cliche, most predictable path possible and even then doesn't give audiences enough time to at least invest in the cliche so that they care when the inevitable happens. \n\n \n\nAs for your other complaints, 100% agree. \n\n \n\nIt is absolutely possible to make great looking, compelling 3D and CGI-heavy effects sequences. But Jackson just couldn't pull it off in these movies. Which is a shame because the lighter CG touch mixed with heavy practical effects that Jackson favored in the initial trilogy worked really well. But as is the 3D focused composition was just terrible. \n\n \n\nAs someone who is at best a casual Tolkeen fan, I have no problem with Jackson taking liberties (even very great liberties) with the original story. I just have a problem with the movies, in the end, not being very good. \n\n \n\nHonestly, I am probably alone here but I would have happily watched a less crowded, more focused Hobbit movie or duology and a separate original movie or duology focusing on the lead-up to the War of the Ring, the corruption of Saruman, etc. \n\n \n\nPS--I didn't realize Tauriel was in cannon--who/where is she in the Lore?\n\nEdited January 5, 2016 by JonofPDX"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197251-peter-jacksons-the-dwarf/?do=findComment&comment=1973487","commentId":1973487,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1452030612,"content":"She isn't."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197251-peter-jacksons-the-dwarf/?do=findComment&comment=1973519","commentId":1973519,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1452031855,"content":"Pretty sure she's not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/197251-peter-jacksons-the-dwarf/?do=findComment&comment=1973733","commentId":1973733,"userName":"Willange","timestamp":1452039474,"content":"I read the Hobbit a couple times, and while the movies are quite different in many aspects from the books, I sincerely enjoyed them a lot.  The LOTR movies were better, but the Hobbit had a few things I loved about it:\n\n1.  The characters (mostly) acted and behaved as I expected them to.\n\n2.  The additions from Tolkien's earlier writings were very welcome.  Sure, they weren't in the book at all, but in his later writings we learn the White Council was operating against the Necromancer at about the same time, and Legolas was eventually added in LOTR, so it made sense that he would have participated in at least some events.  Tauriel was a less welcome addition as she seemed to only be there for the sake of having a female character and her romance with Kili actually made me laugh at one point.  Overall though, I thought the additions made sense and were fairly true to cannon if you consider that the Hobbit was written before Tolkien actually decided to add things like Legolas, the Prince of Mirkwood.\n\n3.  The Battle of the Five Armies may have been only a chapter in the book, but I'm glad they made it long in the movie.  That's because it would've been rather lame if it was too brief.  Also, it makes the Hobbit movies mesh better with the LOTR movies as they also had long and action packed battles (except Fellowship).  That being said, there were some liberties and depictions I didn't enjoy as much.  For example, I really didn't like the giant worm things.  When I saw them, I though, \"Oh look, the Zerg sent Nydus Worms\".  They're pretty cool on their own (if you forget that that's pretty far outside 3rd age scope, 1st age maybe since they had huge and crazy stuff then), but then why not just have the worms eat all the dwarves, elves, and humans?  Why not just burrown inside the mountain?  It presents the same problem the Eagles do, but on the evil side.  The eagles, however, were always there from Tolkien, so you can't blame the movies for that.  The worms however....  Still, mostly cool battle.  Dain riding a battle boar makes it all worth it.\n\n4.  The first two films to a really good job, imho, of capturing the adventuring feel of the Hobbit.  Bilbo is mostly just scared and incapable, the dwarves are clumsy, gandalf is mostly absent, various things are scary, people get captured, gollum riddle scene was top-notch, smaug was cool, and so forth.  You just have to deal with a few over-the-top scenes that seemed really unnecessary to me such as: riding the legs of mountain giants, making a giant liquid-gold dwarf to dump on Smaug, running all over Erebor with Smaug getting easily distracted and taunted, anything involving Tauriel's romance with Kili (you couldn've kept her as a character, but just gotten rid of the elf-dwarf romacnce... just have Legolas go to help because he's nice and then have her chase him because she's in love then she can still save the day somehow and YAY girlpower everyone is happy), etc.\n\n \n\nI think the movies would've been perfect if there were only 2 and you cut out all the crap I mentioned and maybe a little more.  1 movie would've cut out a lot and that would've been disappointing to many, but 3 had too much filler stuff, so 2 would've likely been just about right.\n\n \n\nP.S.
