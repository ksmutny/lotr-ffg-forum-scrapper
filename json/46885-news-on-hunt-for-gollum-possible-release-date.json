I live in Belgium, and as the preview kit isn't available for belgian retailers, this is just a downer. The game is experiencing a hype right now, I know my shopkeeper wants to cash in on this right away because there is a huge demand for the expansion packs. But reading this news... People over here are going to be really disappointed by this, especially since we don't have the option to host a preview event."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46885-news-on-hunt-for-gollum-possible-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=469720","commentId":469720,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1305607328,"content":"ha! my 'nearest' store is about 300miles away from me, and this all reminds me of the south park episode where cartman buys a theme park then doesnt let anyone in, making them go mad with tension, then he lets them in and makes tons of money- maybe FFG is trying this by making us wait? gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46885-news-on-hunt-for-gollum-possible-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=469773","commentId":469773,"userName":"rhino1976","timestamp":1305616822,"content":"looks like UK can't host events either, shame."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46885-news-on-hunt-for-gollum-possible-release-date/?do=findComment&comment=469788","commentId":469788,"userName":"AUCodeMonkey","timestamp":1305618420,"content":" Hey, at least most of y'all are complaining due to geographical constraints.

Though replace Yu-Gi-Oh with the WoW:TCG. I mean the shop owners are good guys and they sound interested in LCG's but they agree with me that it would take a long time to convince others to play. Hopefully another shop I frequent near my work will be hosting an event.
