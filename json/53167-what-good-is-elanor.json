Something like that is the perfect time to cancel the effects. Your heroes won't die which could change the game. Sure you get a new card that might be nasty, but it's likely to be something different that you might be better prepared to deal with.\n\nI wouldn't consider it one of the best hero effects since it is fairly situational, but it can be a lifesaver on occasion. You're essentially trading a potentially devastating effect for hopefully something else that you can deal with at the moment. Maybe there are no enemies in the staging area and you get a treachery, cancel it and the next card could be an enemy that you are ready to deal with versus the treachery that could really mess with you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=528209","commentId":528209,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1316034875,"content":"peterstepon said:\n\nEleanor 7 1 1 2 3\n[Hero]\nGondor.

There are points to make:\n\nIn Rhosgobel, Eleanor is probably the best as she gets to cancel a treachery and increase a chance to reveal Athelas at the same time.\n\nIt really depends on the quest. In those that are mild on treachery, Eleanor is not great. There are quests though where a treachery can be utterly devastating and Eleanor is the only way to save the day (if one cannot play A Test of Will at the moment). Of course, it is situational. However, her ability works well with her nice defensive value - being Gondorian also helps. One needs to build a deck around a bit but that can be done and applies to many heroes. You can then find out that you will use Eleanor in most of the rounds.\n\nAnd she is cheap!\n\nAnd she is hot!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=528271","commentId":528271,"userName":"ianhancock1985","timestamp":1316048035,"content":"The real issue with Elanor is that you need to save her for the quest phase. You could never possibly quest with Elanor... She does almost no damage and while she has respectable armour she doesnt have the hit points to use as a reliable defender, basically if she doesnt cancel a treachery effect she would likely remained untapped this turn.  Not to mention that if you are playing mono spirit, blockers are almost useless since at this stage you dont have anyone that could ever deal with an enemy, you would need to rely on the ranged characters of other players to eliminate an engaged enemy. Compare this to Beravor who, if you save for combat and her services arent required, you can just tap her for cards at the end of the turn- she is never wasted. Thats my problem with Elanor\n\nThink of it this way though- if you had Elanor in a game you could potentially NOT run all of the cancel when revealed effects since you would just be able to nuke it with Elanor. I know at this stage the card pool isnt big enough to say, \"well you can put better stuff in there now since you just freed up 3/6 card slots but its a thought."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=528273","commentId":528273,"userName":"ianhancock1985","timestamp":1316048182,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\ncrease a chance to reveal Athelas at the same time.\n\nIt really depends on the quest.\n\n\n\nIs anyone else building a rounded deck and playing a random adventure?

Therefore, two Encounter cards that look equally bad \"on paper\" will have hugely different effects in any given game situation:\n\nExample:\n\n\"The Necromancer's Reach\" was one of the worst cards ever in the core set if you ask me... it killed more than one Hero and Ally. But only if you have a lot of Exhausted Characters... sometimes you don't. And sometimes you can take it. Some times you'd much rather take a \"Treacherous Fog\" sometimes you don't... depending on how high Threat Levels you have and Howmany locations you have in Staging.\n\nSee? Your assumption that any given Treachery effect is just as bad as anyone else for a given situation in the game is simply NOT TRUE.\n\nI use Eleanor A LOT! I love her and wouldn't trade her for anything. I also use her as a \"Blocker\" if I didn't already Exhaust her during Questing to use her Ability.\n\n/wolf\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=528358","commentId":528358,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1316069704,"content":"KlÃ¸ve said:\n\nGlaurung said:\n\n \n\nianhancock1985 said:\n\n \n\nlleimmoen said:\n\ncrease a chance to reveal Athelas at the same time.\n\n \n\nIt really depends on the quest.\n\n \n\n \n\nIs anyone else building a rounded deck and playing a random adventure?

Hopefully, the next Faq will clarify this.\n\n\n\nBut I would like it this way. I am not trying to make the game easier on players but I often though her ability was pretty weak, and that it could just cancel without replacing. If it does replace and the possible new \"when revealed\" effect is not applied, it not only makes sense to me thematically but also makes Eleanor just about good enough, I think."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530373","commentId":530373,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1316462175,"content":"Initially, I shared your opinion that Elanor was an underwhelming hero.

I think in solo games you are better off putting in three copies of A Test of Will when running the spirit sphere. This has the added benefit of just ignoring the 'when revealed' text and not having to draw another card off the encounter deck. Solo you really need heroes that can pull double duty and without any buffing Elanor just isn't a good choice for attacking or defending. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530389","commentId":530389,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1316464935,"content":"There was actually a situation a friend and I happened into where a treachery card was revealed that was going to kill several allies and potentially 1-2 heroes as well.

The ability to dictate, at least to a degree, what treacheries will hit you is invaluable, especially in quests like J2Rhogobel. She might not fit your playstyle, but worst hero?

Surely Eleanor still would not be overpowered, just compare her then to Éowyn or Legolas if you think so, but it would make the ability quite interesting, possibly getting rid of two nasty treacheries for one exhaustion. I will certainly play it so since the new FAQ suggests it strongly. I hope to get an official confirmation though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=530938","commentId":530938,"userName":"Keggy","timestamp":1316563399,"content":"I've been using Elanor in my hero since the start.  As people have already mentioned, her ability is quite situational, so it doesn't seem as good up front; however, cancelling exceptionally bad treachery cards has kept my heroes and allies time and again.  She as a low threat cost, and a solid 2 armor.  I usually put some Dunedain warnings on her so she can tank in her spare time , and sometimes my spare unexpected courage finds its way on her.\n\nWhile I can see why people aren't too fond of her, I son't see myself faring near as well as I have without her."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53167-what-good-is-elanor/?do=findComment&comment=532462","commentId":532462,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1316851578,"content":"We've recently played a couple of games with three and two players. I was playing Lore and initially used Frodo until we failed the Anduin scenario the first time. I then replaced Frodo with Eleanor as a way to 'dodge' all of the nasty 'Necromancer's Reach' cards which had basically been the reason for losing the game.
