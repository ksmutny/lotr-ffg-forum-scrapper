An unusual situation, but worth bearing in mind!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78091-elfhelm-local-trouble/?do=findComment&comment=753296","commentId":753296,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1359100113,"content":"It looks like he can completely counter the card's effect as long as he is ready.  There's no limit how many times his Response can trigger.  Seems he can neutralize this card pretty well, even multiple copies -- at the price of not being able to use him for anything else (without some character-readying ability, that is).\n\nAnd yeah, an encounter card attached to a character is still considered an encounter card (you just don't have \"control\" over it)."}]}
