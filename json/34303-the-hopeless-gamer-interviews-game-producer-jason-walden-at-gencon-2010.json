If FFG can work to welcome singles (i.e. players without a partner) to their tournaments and randomly match players, I actually think this could grow the local community. You're always working as a team to defeat the game, and this would be something very unique to the traditional competitive tournament format.\n\nFFG's really breaking ground here on a new type of game, and my fingers are crossed so hard that they can make it work. I want this game to have a very long shelf life with tons of support. As an IP, Lord of the Rings has got legs for forever. With a new RPG coming out, The One Ring (hopefully this fall) from Cubicle 7 and the LCG, we may see a resurgence of Lord of the Rings gaming like we haven't seen for several years."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34303-the-hopeless-gamer-interviews-game-producer-jason-walden-at-gencon-2010/?do=findComment&comment=348607","commentId":348607,"userName":"9thimmortal","timestamp":1282730738,"content":"Organized play would be very difficult in co-op (how to stop cheating), although maybe random partners would help.  That seems very weird though, what if you just get placed with crappy partners?  I guess that could happen to anyone (the best seeds are paired with the worst?...but maybe the worst were the worst because they were originally placed with the very worst...might take a TON of rounds to work that out). \n\nMakes my head hurt trying to work out a viable competative, cooportive tourney...but that is what FFG employees get paid the big bucks for!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/34303-the-hopeless-gamer-interviews-game-producer-jason-walden-at-gencon-2010/?do=findComment&comment=348876","commentId":348876,"userName":"Saintsman","timestamp":1282768689,"content":"Dunno, without using random partners then you would be showing up at tourneys to play with your teammates people you play with all the time as it is.
