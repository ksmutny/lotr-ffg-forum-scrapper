I expect the tactics Master attachment to increase attack. As for it's other ability I'm not sure. Perhaps decrease defense of enemies engaged with you?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299925-the-city-of-ulfast/?do=findComment&comment=3856857","commentId":3856857,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1577459724,"content":"Updated to Shipping Now.

Guarded cards (depending on if there's a Hobbit/Sting or Dwarf/Thror's Ring), after which people seem to splash Citadel Plate, Ancestral Armor, Burning Brand, and a few of the other expensive/power items to taste).  So the loot deck is already roughly 80% pre-built, in what I've seen so far.  In my opinion, though, the interesting part of deck-building for the Burglar's Turn isn't the Loot Deck itself (which is boring already), but rather what you do with a 50+ card player deck and trio of heroes that cannot have any innate attachments, and in multi-player how the other deck(s) adapt to pick up the attachment slack of the Burglar.  In this regard, I think it's the most interesting deck-building contract. since it not only radically changes the Burglar's deck but also the deck of the other player(s) involved.\n\nSo to that end, I don't think a few more guarded cards would undermine the interesting aspects of the contract.  In fact, I think a few more quality guarded cards would go a long way to helping the contract be a bit more appealing.\n\nHaving played quite a bit with the Burglar's Turn contract, I'm pretty comfortable saying that it's the most underwhelming of the contracts so far (all of which my group have proxied and tried to some degree).  Even in 3-Player, with the other two players devoting a portion of their deck to play attachments on the \"Burglar\" player's characters, I'd say the loot is \"meh\" at best.  When actively slow-rolling quests as much as possible (e.g. lots of Threat Control and Side Quests), we've typically only claimed 4-6 loot cards per Quest (meaning for any given piece of loot, you have less than a 50% of seeing it appear during a game), and the most loot we have ever claimed in a game was 8 cards--just over half of the deck.  When not building to explicitly slow-roll or when having fewer players with less chance of staging a location each turn, the loot becomes even less frequently claimed. \n\nThe costs of Burglar's Turn are very high: having to give up attachments in one deck is a huge cost, since many of the best cards in the game are attachments (e.g. Steward of Gondor, Unexpected Courage, etc.).   The contract also forces you to travel to locations, which is something most decks never seem to bother with usually, instead preferring to just clear out locations with progress tokens prior to traveling.  So when burglaring you actually have to endure all those travel costs.  If you're not flipping locations, the contract fails to do anything at all (a problem that is more pronounced with fewer players).  The contract also fails to do anything if you travel and flip a unique attachment that is already in play, so if you want to use the Loot Deck as an opportunity to have an additional copy of an item that you also want to include in another player's deck, you risk shutting down the contract on some turns should  another copy come into play first. so you can't use the loot deck to improve the reliability/efficiency of key unique items seeing play.  Finally, the contract increases the quest point of locations for not just loot, but any attachments on the location.  So if you want to use the contract to build synergy with other cards that attach to locations and all the player cards that trigger off of them, you start getting diminishing returns. \n\n\nDon't get me wrong, the Burglar's Turn is still a very fun contract as-is, and I'll enjoy using it even if no more guarded cards or quality items drop this cycle.  But I'd like to see a few more, like a Spirit Weapon analog and maybe something for Elves or Dunedain only akin to Sting / Thror's Ring."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299925-the-city-of-ulfast/?do=findComment&comment=3857162","commentId":3857162,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1577482744,"content":">

I do think that while the contract will use most of the same attachments over and over(especially the guarded ones), the randomization of the order is actually a lot of fun! You never know what your gonna get but its guaranteed to be useful. Every time I travel to a location im excited to see what new attachment Im getting... The designers have made travelling pretty exciting with this card (since travelling tends to be not the most exciting part for most people)\n\nThis contract is less consistent than the others but its really fun and yes, you will be able to still win games with it. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299925-the-city-of-ulfast/?do=findComment&comment=3857291","commentId":3857291,"userName":"pmdoug","timestamp":1577494274,"content":"The Burglar's Turn is probably best when used with decks that would normally run less than 15 attachments, and instead focus on allies and events. Although losing certain key attachments can be a real bummer, the draw and resource advantage of the Loot Deck will often make up for that. Personally, I'm in favor of anything that makes Steward of Gondor and Unexpected Courage impossible to play. It is a bummer that of the 14 Loot cards, ~10 will be essentially auto-includes. I haven't tested these yet, but I think the contract would work very well with heroes that favor allies: S Theoden, T Imrahil, Hirgon, etc.\n\nI think I'll build a Burglar Rohan deck with S Theoden since many of the pricey artifact/item attachments can go on him. Then the main deck can have at least 30 allies. I doubt it will a very consistent deck, but it should be viable with some luck. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299925-the-city-of-ulfast/?do=findComment&comment=3857710","commentId":3857710,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1577562419,"content":"There is a playthrough on youtube by Mister Underhill of Foundations of Stone with The Burglar's Turn.
