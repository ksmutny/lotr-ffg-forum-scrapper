My first idea was to beat it using Damrod and traps, but 1) I think I beat it the first time I played it by using traps and 2) Teamjimby already used that strategy, and I wanted to try something different.\n\n \n\nMy first several tries were to use Treebeard + Elrond, but I couldn't seem to get built up enough to be able to defend all three bosses by the time my threat hit 30. Then I tried Grima + Rossiel, but I couldn't build up enough attack power (even though amassing an army of allies wasn't difficult at all).

If I didn't find it by turn 3, the ship was already sinking at that point so I scooped the game and started over.\n \nWhen it did show up, however, this deck did pretty well. The idea is to keep Delay the Enemy around, purposely under-questing so that I can Battle-quest my way through the entire game. Gimli starts out questing, but then that duty transitions over to the allies once I had enough of them down, and I could start to kill off the enemies one or two at a time.\n \nThe Nazgul turned out to be a piece of cake--my favourite win was when I took down the Nazgul pretty easily in one turn by defending with a Gondorian Spearman who had a Spear of the Citadel attached, then attacked with Gimli who had two Dwarrodelf Axes. Piece of cake!\n \nFun challenge, but I have to say, now I remember why I didn't like the Heirs + ATS quests. I feel like it's pretty easy to build \"the deck\" that works consistently against any given quest, but it doesn't leave much room for alternative strategies. I struggled to find a consistent solo solution for this challenge that wasn't \"traps + direct damage\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/188678-challenge-4/?do=findComment&comment=1809203","commentId":1809203,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1442820619,"content":">  \n> \n> >  Boromir thematically sacrificed himself in a last effort to (successfully) save his brother.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Awesome!
