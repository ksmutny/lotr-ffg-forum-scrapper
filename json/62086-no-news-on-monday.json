They've had articles on 5 out of the last 7 Mondays. That's pretty consistant in my book. The only time they don't have a Monday article is when they have another article in the week, usually announcing the release of a new adventure pack.\n\nLook, I'm as addicted to Monday news as anybody but let's just relax guys. The reason they didn't have an article yesterday is because someday this week (probably tomorrow or Thursday) they're going to announce the release of Rivendell and have the preview of Elladan in that article.
