I have been playing on an off for a few years. I have sold it and re-purchased this game TWICE!! The first time, I found the game impossible to play solo, which was my primary mode of play and reason I bought the game. I sold it a second time because I didn't feel like it was feeling roleplay'y enough for me (if that makes any sense), and I found The One Ring RPG. Now, I'm moving away and will be back to playing solo and thanks to EASY MODE, I'm back for a THIRD try. haha. I see the new SAGA Expansion has a new Campaign Mode.\n\nÂ \n\nDo you guys think there would ever be a campaign mode of the base game and the Story Cycles (outside of the SAGA Boxes), I mean Against the Shadow, Dwarrowdelf and Journey Though Mirkwood. Against the Shadow is telling a great story so far, I was hoping it would feel even more in depth, but I like the direction of the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86199-campaign-system-for-base-game/?do=findComment&comment=812541","commentId":812541,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373585666,"content":"i suppose that they could release some sort of addition to the old quests, much like they are with difficulty. or they could eventually just adopt the saga campaign to make it so we can play it with any quest, previous or new.\n\ni think some general boons and burdens that could be added would be good...but so far i am just looking forward to the current experience of playing through the events of the ring!\n\nrich\n\nEdited July 11, 2013 by richsabre"}]}
