I'm also UK based, so I used the following:\n\nhttps://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004P317A0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 [https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B004P317A0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o09_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1]\n\nThese fit the LOTR cards with either FFG sleeves or UltraPro sleeves. I ordered a 10 pack several years ago. I recently built the final box in order to fit the more recent cycles. I put each sphere in a separate box, and then neutral and other odd ones (Valour, Doomed, Secrecy) in another. Then each cycle and some sagas go in each other box.\n\nIt works quite well and is very cost effective, *but* I had to custom make dividers to separate, eg, heroes from allies from attachments etc in each sphere box, and I have to remember my rough organisation within each category. My custom dividers are super crude, but they do the trick. My standard procedure is to lump allies by trait (so all silvans), and order them by cost, then attachments by effect/trait (so ranger attachments, resources, location control), then events by effect/trait.\n\nIt can be a little slow finding a specific card, but it is fairly neat, fits on a shelf, and because I can write on them I know exactly what's in each box. My main gripe is that boxes with relatively few cards in them don't keep the cards upright: what I really need are tiny bookends to hold the cards in place, but that's maybe a step too far. Anyway, that's one option. They're solid boxes btw. I've moved house 4 times with them, including a full on inter-city move, and they held up, and all my cards are safe. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\nEdited March 22, 2017 by monkeyrama"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245446-long-term-storage-solution/?do=findComment&comment=2698176","commentId":2698176,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1490194243,"content":"I was not aware of a size difference between different printings of the core set.
