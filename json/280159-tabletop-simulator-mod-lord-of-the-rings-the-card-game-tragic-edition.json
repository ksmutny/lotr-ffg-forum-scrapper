This is Lord of The Rings LCG... Some of you may remember I released the very 1st virtual deckstop version of LoTR on LackeyCCG (well before OCTGN!) \n\nNow there are a billion cards for this.. so I am just releasing it in stages. This is ONLY the Mirkwood Cycle at the moment. Though I'll add more cycles as I go. The modis designed for 2 Handed Solo and 2 PLayer... it will eventually have support for Solo play (as in one handed) and 3 and 4 player. \n\nThe mod also contains a deck builder that can import data from RingsDB.com [http://ringsDB.com] and ZorBec's LoTR Deck Builder [http://eric.minet.free.fr/lotrbuilder/dbdesc_en.htm].\n\nIt is heavily scripted so make sure you read the mod description or watch the youtube instructions. \n\n * INSTRUCTIONS : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emg0FiLvYyg [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emg0FiLvYyg]\n\nMy Steam nick is Tragic [https://steamcommunity.com/id/TragicTheBlathering] (icon is a little purple one eyed monster)... why not friend me and we can play sometime!\n\n * Lord of the Ring : The Card Game (LCG) - Tragic Editio [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1392551585]n Mod @SteamWorkshop\n\nI'm doing a Progression Play Through on uTube [https://boardgamegeek.com/video/174381/lord-rings-card-game/tragedy-rings-progression-series] using the mod if you want to see it in action.\n\nEdited August 2, 2018 by TragicTheBlathering"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280159-tabletop-simulator-mod-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-tragic-edition/?do=findComment&comment=3423967","commentId":3423967,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1533191304,"content":"UPDATED\n\nMy LoTR-LCG mod has been updated to include all of DWARROWDELF Quests and Card Pool. This includes the two HOBBIT SAGA boxes. The Deck editor has been fixed for both RingsDB and Zorbecs Deck Builder.\n\nThere is a heap of other updates and fixes as well, form the time of that original video. If anyone needs a new instruction video, just let me know!\n\n * •Instructions : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emg0FiLvYyg [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Emg0FiLvYyg]\n\nThis mod is heavily scripted and uses HOTKEYS to automate much of the process of playing the card game. Please watch the video and read the instructions on the MOD page.\n\n * Youtube Playlist of 2 handed Solo using this Mod : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Zfezz9frI&list=PL5jEpKM7fpc_Se6OEUEYDvjpWfnmg8gPW [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-Zfezz9frI&list=PL5jEpKM7fpc_Se6OEUEYDvjpWfnmg8gPW]\n\nThe Mod also contains a bunch of pre-made decks I have used to beat the included quests for you to try without the need to deck building. At the moment I have only put in 2 handed Decks.. but will add Solo decks in the future.\n\nNext Update will be for the SHADOW CYCLE and should also include 3 Handed Mode.\n\nEdited August 2, 2018 by TragicTheBlathering"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280159-tabletop-simulator-mod-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game-tragic-edition/?do=findComment&comment=3424321","commentId":3424321,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1533210985,"content":"Amazing work, as always.
