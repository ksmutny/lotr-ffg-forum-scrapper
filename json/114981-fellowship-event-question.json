So I was just curious as to exactly what happens. Does every person that participates get the PoD? Is it a competition? Is it casual? Do I have to play in a group or can I play solo? How much does it cost? etc.\n\nAny clarifying information would be helpful so I know what I am getting into and what I should show up with when I do go."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114981-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=1236697","commentId":1236697,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1409306333,"content":"From what I know :\n\n- each pack is around 20 euros... (yeah, sorry, don't know for USA)\n\n- each pack is 4 times : 1 pod, 1 alternative art aragon, 1 playmat\n\n- pack can only be purchased by shop\n\n \n\nThat's all.\n\nWe don't like the official competitive format in France (should I dare say europe ?), and we have people preparing meetup in a shop, all players are assigned to table of 4 and can deckbuild beforehand."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114981-fellowship-event-question/?do=findComment&comment=1236725","commentId":1236725,"userName":"Caerdowyn","timestamp":1409309106,"content":"I think that in Europe, if you want a competitive LotR game you can still find enough people to play Decipher's CCG."}]}
