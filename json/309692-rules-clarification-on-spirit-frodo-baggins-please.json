Do I apply one archery damage at a time?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309692-rules-clarification-on-spirit-frodo-baggins-please/?do=findComment&comment=3960633","commentId":3960633,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1594449649,"content":"You can use it to prevent damage larger than his health. Frodo's ability should be understood as something like \"Response: If Frodo Baggins would take X damage, raise your threat by X instead\". Cancellation/replacement effects in this game all work in that sort of way.\n\nFor archery damage specifically you have to assign the archery damage all together before applying it, so you can't assign more archery to Frodo than his remaining health."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309692-rules-clarification-on-spirit-frodo-baggins-please/?do=findComment&comment=3960634","commentId":3960634,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1594449940,"content":"At least he can swallow two archery without dying then. üòÅ\n\nThanks."}]}
