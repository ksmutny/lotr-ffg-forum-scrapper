Everyone must to bring a encounter sets from the core box. So there is will be some additional encounter cards for every encounter set from core box. Its mean you can play entire SOM cycle with new challenge. Sounds very good. Hope we can buy those cards after?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73412-world-championship-weekend-in-november/?do=findComment&comment=718214","commentId":718214,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1351865122,"content":"ahhh….just got the title- guess one of the cards switches off the lights….crafty ffg lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73412-world-championship-weekend-in-november/?do=findComment&comment=718532","commentId":718532,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1351950295,"content":"i hope they don't just add a few new enemies and treacheries to each quest, because that wont be very long-lasting. we'll just play the quests a few times with the new cards, and then they will go straight back into the cupboard again.\n\nwhat they need to do is make a small group of cards which are quest-independant, and can be dropped into the old ones, and all the future one too, to make them play different. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73412-world-championship-weekend-in-november/?do=findComment&comment=718756","commentId":718756,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1352017974,"content":" I hope they keep up the amazing work with these new cards and then put them on PoD for everyone that can't attend as usual :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
