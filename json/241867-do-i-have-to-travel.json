You are not obliged to. You can't travel if you already have active location."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241867-do-i-have-to-travel/?do=findComment&comment=2626303","commentId":2626303,"userName":"zuck515","timestamp":1486296447,"content":"oh! I didn't know the excess progress went to the quest! Thank for that!\n\nSo if I understand correctly, let's say I choose to not travel to a location and I don't have any active location, I produce 6 progress tokens, the location has got 2 \"threat\", so I'm allowed to do 6-2 and put the 4 progress tokens onto the quest? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241867-do-i-have-to-travel/?do=findComment&comment=2626313","commentId":2626313,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1486297637,"content":"If you have no active location, all progress made during the quest phase goes on the current quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241867-do-i-have-to-travel/?do=findComment&comment=2626337","commentId":2626337,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1486301145,"content":"yes, your scenario is correct.

What happens is during the quest phase, you place progress on any active location -- if there is one -- then on the current quest. THEN, you move to the travel phase and decide whether or not to travel, but only if there is not already an active location."}]}
