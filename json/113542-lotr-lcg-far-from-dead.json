Those are all people that need to see the game that sentinels wishes it could be.\n\nI agree that LOTR is a much deeper game than Sentinels but i like it to very much. Last year i was between (to get) Sentinels and Pathfinder. After a game or two of Pathfinder i find it to be just a worst and simplified version of LOTR, Sentinels on the other hand it's a very different game, it is a simple thematic co op card game that focuses 100% in combat and requires 0 deck building.\n\nSo i think LOTR is the game Pathfinder wishes to be."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113542-lotr-lcg-far-from-dead/?do=findComment&comment=1206952","commentId":1206952,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1408263004,"content":"Lol what? Pathfinder is not simplified version of LotR, it's entirely different game in it's root and does not remotely wishes to be LotR.

Both are good games with major differences. In LotR you build your complete deck and no dice. But with Pathfinder you have to aquire the cards as you go by playing the senarios. So there might be a card you really want but can't play it until you find it. Both frustrating and satisfying. And of course dice. I like the new Bain and treasure cards LotR has for the sagas. Kinda gives you the same feel of getting more experience."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113542-lotr-lcg-far-from-dead/?do=findComment&comment=1207330","commentId":1207330,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1408285960,"content":">  I like the new Bain\n\n \n\nFather?..\n\n \n\ntOpghP-icvo.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c620831/v620831009/12e2d/tOpghP-icvo.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113542-lotr-lcg-far-from-dead/?do=findComment&comment=1207425","commentId":1207425,"userName":"Mogloth","timestamp":1408290233,"content":"What is this in flight report you speak of?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113542-lotr-lcg-far-from-dead/?do=findComment&comment=1207502","commentId":1207502,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1408294044,"content":"Every year at GenCon, the CEO of FFG gives a review of the last year and a preview of the year to come.
