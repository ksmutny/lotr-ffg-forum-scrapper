I typically play 2 player with another experienced player, but we'll be adding two novice players (only played 1-2 times before) to the mix. \n\nI'm considering 4 player Pelennor Fields. Battles are a good fit for larger player counts and it's a big moment in the story that every knows about. Is this scenario too complicated for newer players?\n\nWhat is your favorite quest for 4 players? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/250154-best-scenario-for-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=2794536","commentId":2794536,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1495160636,"content":"Foundations of Stone or Breaking of the Fellowship are some of my favorites for 4 player.

It has no special rules not featured in the base rules (like City damage in Pelennor or separate staging areas), so it is much easier to Follow for a novice player. It isn't my favourite scenario and doesn't have anything to do with the books, but from experience it doesn't help when people know the place/characters, but can't follow the game. \n\nAdding to this: Most new players struggle with deck-building and/or playing their deck at least decent. Stuff like Pelenor or Botf is much more Challenging than Anduin (especially when Guided by an experienced player) and people tend to have more fun when they win or at least do fine/contribute to the win. \n\nI could Go on how I would introduce new players, but the point is: I recommend Anduin. If everyone knows it already/doesn't like it etc. I would Go for Amon Dhin or Redhorn Gate. \n\nEdit: Favourite quest would be Helm's Deep. But that's not beginner friendly, so I can't recommend it. \n\nEdited May 19, 2017 by Calvadur"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/250154-best-scenario-for-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=2795342","commentId":2795342,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1495210116,"content":"If you are building the decks yourself, you could try Escape from Mount Gram.
