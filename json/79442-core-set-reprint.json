You can not trivialize your own opinion. Of course there are sufficient players who only want to try a certain number of expensions. Thousands is a ridiculous hyberbole, there are only a few keywords? Then I am surprised that you are still not able to keep them in your mind.\n\nI remember the comments when Khazad-Dum was first published. Many players complained that one encounter set could not be played (cause it would have been part of the comming expensions). They were disappointed to have payed money for an expension and still can not play everything. Now they were \"forced\" to buy another expension, too.\n\nI wouldnt buy a whole new core set only because of a new rulebook. lol Why you dont follow the copy & paste method? Open Word, copy and paste the keyword explanations, that you can not keep in your mind, and then print it out! sonreir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sonreir.gif]"}]}
