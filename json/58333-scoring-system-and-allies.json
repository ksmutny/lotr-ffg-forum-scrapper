There they are regarded with high esteem and honor and they are not thrown away lightly. In the game they are sacrificed with ease and there is no penalty for it (except that they are gone). Not even in the scoring system.\n\n\nI propose a simple change for the scoring system (http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LOTR_LCG_Score_Sheet.pdf [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/lotr-lcg/support/LOTR_LCG_Score_Sheet.pdf]\n).\n\n+ Number of allies killed by damage from enemies and treachery (tally)\n\n/Peter\n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58333-scoring-system-and-allies/?do=findComment&comment=573933","commentId":573933,"userName":"t_rothlisberger","timestamp":1325538178,"content":" A lot of nameless men died in the War of the Ring.  \n\nex.

But it's really simply a feature of the game; sacrificing allies is also a method of paying for effects - they're just a type of card. Punishing players for playing the game as it's meant to be played strikes me as silly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58333-scoring-system-and-allies/?do=findComment&comment=574066","commentId":574066,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1325563435,"content":" THe way the OP has worded it, discarding allies to pay for effects wouldn't be included in the extra score.\n\nEither way, since the re-vamp of the scoring system, with the +10 points per round, I really can't see it making any difference. Even if you care about the scores, chump-blocking is still going to make sense on a basic numbers game- even if you have to kill 9 allies to finish one round quicker!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58333-scoring-system-and-allies/?do=findComment&comment=574208","commentId":574208,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1325587855,"content":" Part of the mark of a good scoring system is that it's easy to administer.  The current system already requires you to keep track of one extra piece of information.  Keeping track of how many allies got killed in addition would just be cumbersome."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58333-scoring-system-and-allies/?do=findComment&comment=576635","commentId":576635,"userName":"VTSvsAlucard","timestamp":1326053876,"content":" I like to think of it as the allies becoming incapacitated or too weary to continue.

And we the game is finished we count the dead, by checking the discard pile for each player and tally.  If a player manages to renew his player card pile or get an ally back from the discard pile, they are not counted."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58333-scoring-system-and-allies/?do=findComment&comment=576709","commentId":576709,"userName":"Bonus Card","timestamp":1326069825,"content":"However how about \"will of the west\", \"stand and fight\" and other cards that manipulate allies from the discard pile back into your hand or deck? I agree that a card or cards can try to penalize you for killing allies, but instead of changing the game why not add in some treachery or other encounter cards that do this?"}]}
