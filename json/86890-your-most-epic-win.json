In quest phase he plays Beorn with Sneak Attack, then play 2 more sneak playing beorn and Gandalf in combat phase. Between, he played 2 Grave Cairn over Aragorn or Glorfinder (with the 8 attack of Beorn). In total 8 -first Cairn- + 3 glorfinder + 8 -second Cairn- + 3 Aragorn + 4 Gandalf + 3 other Beorn in hand: total 29, just to kill Smaug (that had \"immediatley attack\").\n\n \n\nAll the game suffering!

It was a tight and tense game tonight... I cant bear such games every day, I tell you, this was the last time! ;-)\n\nEdit: As this wasnt enaugh suffer, we had more than 7 rounds the Old Thrush in staging area, noone claimed it, cause it wasnt clear at no point who could do the final attacks since noone of us had any mentionable attack strenght.
