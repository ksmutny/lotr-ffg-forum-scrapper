They all look great and I'd love to get my hands on them. \n\nThey seem to have almost zero presence on eBay (I've been checking the last 4-ish months). They were either *really* limited, or the people who got them are very attached - which I would understand :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\n \n\nWhat do you guys think? Are they lost to time?  \n\nEdited December 14, 2017 by Tom1132"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265375-past-fellowship-alt-arts/?do=findComment&comment=3125636","commentId":3125636,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1513275651,"content":"Yeah, they pop up less and less on eBay the further out from their release you get. Typically ones released at Gencon are going to be more expensive than the ones included with Fellowship events, as there are far less of them. You could try Boardgame Geek? I've bought/sold some alternate art cards on there. Also, depending on which ones you're looking for I have a few I'd be willing to sell. Faramir, Legolas, and Celeborn. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265375-past-fellowship-alt-arts/?do=findComment&comment=3133441","commentId":3133441,"userName":"Tom1132","timestamp":1513645155,"content":"> On 14/12/2017 at 6:20 PM, Chris51261 said:\n> \n> Yeah, they pop up less and less on eBay the further out from their release you get.
