Black Riders was like this as well, with the Riders themselves for example."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99815-legacy-of-numenor-doomed-4-instead-of-3/?do=findComment&comment=992485","commentId":992485,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1393083009,"content":"Just imagine this. If you get one of those cards in your opening hand - you can play anything on turn 1. More of it, if you get several of those cards... you technically will be able to play your entire hand on your first turn and you will still have some resources left. But you'll need to manage your threat somehow. Of, who am I kidding, just take this Loragorn and get on with it.\n\n \n\nAnd, by the way, just a multiplayer scenario: everyone takes and abuses those doomed cards, and one of players just takes Loragorn and some Spirit hero such as Spirfindel and takes 3 copies of desperate allience. Doomed spam, then everyone refreshes their threat and ready to go."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99815-legacy-of-numenor-doomed-4-instead-of-3/?do=findComment&comment=993133","commentId":993133,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1393149323,"content":"Yes this combo very obvious in this case... we already discussed it a while ago..... sounds crazy powerful!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99815-legacy-of-numenor-doomed-4-instead-of-3/?do=findComment&comment=995468","commentId":995468,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1393338580,"content":"On a bad note, if they changed final text after preveiw, the same thing may happen with \"Attached hero\" wording on Glamdring. \n\nBUT, there still a high Gandalf possibility, as the only Gandalf it makes sense to attach Glamdring to is Hobbit one, and they won't do that kind of move, in my opinion."}]}
