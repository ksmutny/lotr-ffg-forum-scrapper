We still have a willpower that is less than the threat level. How do we gat past this. The intro game asks for \"Passage through Mirkwood\" and the setup needs a 1 copy of Forest Spiders and 1Â Copy of Old Forest Road. If the Willpower of our chosen Sphere is never above the Threat at the start of the game how do you proceed.\n\nCheers\n\nRS"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53667-new-player-quest-resolution/?do=findComment&comment=532639","commentId":532639,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1316899931,"content":"Well, when you play allies that's more willpower available. Also, when you engage an enemy or travel to a location you no longer count it's threat level while questing. The idea is to travel to locations as quickly as possible and to kill (or at least engage) enemies so their threat no longer counts while questing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53667-new-player-quest-resolution/?do=findComment&comment=532647","commentId":532647,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1316902687,"content":"Remember to draw one event card per player after committing to the quest. It's quite easy for threat to exceed willpower for the first turn of a two player game.\n\nAlso, remember that the active location and engaged enemies do not count towards your total threat."}]}
