This is one of FFG's most popular sellers, so they're routinely running out of stock and reprinting. Generally takes a few months, though. If you want, there's no problem skipping ahead to the Khazad-Dum/Dwarrowdelf cycle. If those are on reprint as well, try the Saga boxes. I wouldn't recommend skipping straight to the Against the Shadow/Heirs of Numenor cycle. It's notoriously difficult for inexperienced players with a weaker card pool.\n\n \n\nEdit: You can check status of reprints here:\n\n \n\nhttps://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/upcoming/]\n\nEdited November 30, 2016 by Network57"}]}
