So I ended up limiting myself even more, in that I didn't even incorporate the current pack's cards in trying to defeat that quest. The end result was probably a tougher first win than otherwise, but once I got that first win it was a nice personal reward to get to deck build with the new cards. I did play with KD cards the first time through those quests, however.\n\nNow, I got the packs one by one as they were released, so it's a different environment than what you have. I just had fun doing it my way, so I thought I'd share.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62948-new-player-recommended-use-of-adventure-packs/?do=findComment&comment=616082","commentId":616082,"userName":"Cotillion37","timestamp":1334103679,"content":"I'm playing through for the first time myself. When I'm not playing co-op games with my girlfriend, I'm soloing through the quests as they were released which gives me the satisfaction of beating it the way the AP's were released.
