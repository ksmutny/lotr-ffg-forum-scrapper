If a play is not eliminated but has no heroes (shuffled in to his deck) how would an un defended attack resolve. We resolved it by making another player take the undefended damage. But is that correct way to resolve the situation ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204228-undefended-attack-on-a-player-with-no-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=2079754","commentId":2079754,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1456885078,"content":"In the very rare case that you describe I'd say you don't assign the damage to anyone.  \n\n \n\nConsider it a small blessing to offset the considerable challenges: no heroes to collect resources, no way to get additional cards in play, and yet still need to reveal an additional card for staging so threat is likely to escalate out of bounds."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204228-undefended-attack-on-a-player-with-no-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=2079918","commentId":2079918,"userName":"wtfboar","timestamp":1456895514,"content":"I don't know maybe.

You could have Halbarad as a hero to help you take on more enemies in the early game then kill him off."}]}
