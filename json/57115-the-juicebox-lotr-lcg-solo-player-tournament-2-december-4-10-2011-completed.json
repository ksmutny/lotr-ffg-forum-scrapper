The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.)\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. Specifically, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!\n\nSolo Player Tournament #2:\n\nQuest: Passage Through Mirkwood\nDeck Parameters: Open Build, Monosphere Deck Only*\nNumber of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck\n\n*In deck building for this week’s tournament, you may use cards from any number of available sets and adventure packs to construct your minimum 50-card deck.

Furthermore I had Protector of Lorien and a Rivendell Minstrell. The adventure didn't began promising, but thanks to Denethor's foresight my group avoided an orc camp led by Chieftain Ufthal. The group decided to travel the Old Forest Road, not listening to Beorn's warnings. There they crossed the way of a nasty King Spider which immediatly hurt Glorfindel while Denethor kept a Forest Spider away.\n\nNext the heroes heard some distant cries, apparently coming from a Great Forest Web, but they decided not to travel there. On their way they met Gandalf who helped them escape both spiders. He killed the Forest Spider with a mighty spell, and used his staff to kill the King Spider which had attacked Denethor before.\n\nIn round 3 the group was followed by a Beastmaster, but managed to keep him at distance. Joined by a Rivendell Minstrell the heroes eventually travelled to the Great Forest Web while using Protector of Lorien to get through stage 1B.\n\nIn round 4 a Forest Gate appeared. The fellowship chose to travel through it. Cunning Radagast send some help so the Beastmaster posed no threat, which enabled the group to finish stage 2B. The fooled Beastmaster became very angry and attacked Denethor, but the latter stood his ground.\n\nIn the final turn Gandalf returnd and delivered some new resources (3 cards). The fellowship lost some of them (3 cards) when the were haunted by The Eyes Of The Forest, but then Gandalf led them quickly to the end of Beorn's Path and left the haunted woods.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=564204","commentId":564204,"userName":"p_toler","timestamp":1323103166,"content":"After several attempts with different hero constellations I managed to win with the spirit deck (Dunhere, Eowyn and Frodo).

As someone said earlier though there are very few cards that I could have drawn that wouldn't have stopped me completing stage 1 of the quest in turn 1.\n\nLikewise Beastmaster is a horrible card, but only if you have to interact with it, 2 threat is nothing against the questing power of Gandalf!\n\nTurn two was a quest with Aragorn, Imrahil and Gandalf  - Aragorn readies himself, Gandalf was readied through travel to the forest road, and Imrahil was readied when the spawn ate my snowbourne scout.\n\nTaking out The big nasty required all og my characters Aragorn, Imrahil, Gandalf and Gloin.

I know that deckbuilding is not possible here (I only have the first 3 AP's, so all I can do is to choose three cards to discard), but this way you're forced (or, from my perspective, allowed) to use cards that you never played before. Did you ever play Thicket Of Spears? I never used this card before, and probably never will (unless there will be a Song of Make Me Tactics someday), but it's such a great feeling when Uungoliant's spawn and its friends try to kill you and you just - bang - neutralize them all with one single card.\n\nYou're right about the scoring though. But then this problem is caused by the game's character itself which makes it impossible to create a satisfying scoring system."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57115-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-2-december-4-10-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=564912","commentId":564912,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1323237887,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n \n\nGave it another try and achieved 38, too.

Since the top three for both Leadership and Spirit are currently in the Top Ten overall, my plan at this point will be to create an Honorable Mention category for this week in the main post to show off the top three results for both Tactics and Lore. As it stands currently, the entire Top Ten is either Leadership or Spirit with the exception of leptokurt's Lore result. Interestingly, muemakan's Lore result is also Top Ten worthy and would be included, were it not for his ridiculously excellent tie with Bungo_Underhill for top of the pile.\n\nNice job everyone.
