Caleb has already clarified this, and it is confirmed in the latest FAQ. Harbor Master says \"After a card effect adds any number of resources\", this only works with effects that increase the total number of resources under player control. Moving resources does *not* count as *adding* resources, but *moving* and *adding* both count as *gaining* resources. The other relevant verb is *collecting* which is not a card effect as it is part of the framework of the game and happens automatically during the resource phase (and does also count as *gaining* resources).\n\nEdited January 21, 2015 by danpoage"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132580-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=1415437","commentId":1415437,"userName":"Veve7","timestamp":1421844873,"content":"Changing Will of The West is THE WORST idea that i had seen in the game!Why they changed a card that was here since the core set?!\n\nEdited January 21, 2015 by Veve7"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132580-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=1415449","commentId":1415449,"userName":"Serazu","timestamp":1421845335,"content":"Solid changes.

But it's definitely better for the health of the game to address the cards in the core set, in light of new cards coming out and new designs.\n\n \n\nIt's even worth going back to the core set designs to see which ones ended up being too strong or weak even when not compared to future cards and changing those too.\n\nPersonally I'd have liked to see the core set re-done at the time that they released the \"easy\" mode to quests (then we could have got a fancy core update that everyone would want to get with all errata applied).

Have the main person responsible for \"reshuffling\" run 3 copies, and then another player or two can run a copy, just for safety in the rare case that the main person has not drawn into one when it is needed. Then, make sure someone is running Eowyn, so you can just pitch the extras for willpower. \n\nEdited January 23, 2015 by divinityofnumber"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132580-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=1419124","commentId":1419124,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1422040440,"content":"Nothing about Master of Lore, it could be writes: limit twice per round. -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132580-new-faq/?do=findComment&comment=1421766","commentId":1421766,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1422269178,"content":"I thought that the combo GandalfHero-HiddenCache-ExperTreasureHunter-Pipe would be faqqed.
