Generally speaking Forced effects do not interrupt each other until they are fully resolved (I remember some stuff about that regarding some Burdens and The Lonely Mountain quest)\n\nBut you can definitely not use any Responses until the Forced attack is resolved (quoting an answer from Caleb about SpPippin), even though you have the usual Action windows opened for an attack.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> The Forced effect on the Rider is triggered by failing a hide test, which happens before it engages you, so that has to be resolved before anything else. The Rider will engage you (passive) and attack (Forced) and there is no opportunity to trigger Pippin's Response between those two things. After the attack resolves would be your first opportunity to trigger Pippin's ability to return the Rider to the staging area, which you could do at that time. That can still be helpful since it will prevent the Rider from attacking during the combat phase, but there really is no way to stop a Rider from attacking when you fail a hide test.\n\n \n\nEdited March 24 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307136-timing-question-a-shadow-of-the-past/?do=findComment&comment=3918592","commentId":3918592,"userName":"rees263","timestamp":1585062155,"content":"Well that totally breaks my understanding of actions, responses and forced effects.

That's the interpretation that I will continue to use.\n\nTriggering multiple immediate attacks as in the example adds more complication, but I suppose there are a couple of ways you could rationalise it: either the second forced effect triggers during the action window of the first attack and \"lines up\" the second attack for afterwards; or once you trigger the first attack the second effect isn't eligible to trigger until after its done, at which point the \"trigger at the first available opportunity\" time occurs and you get the second attack.

The Hide Test is a failure (Hero A is still ready), the constant effect of the quest has the Rider engage us then both the Condition and the Black Rider Forced are triggered. From previous rulings we can choose the order to resolve them, but when does the second one come into play? Can we choose the Black Rider attack first, defend with Hero A, getting it killed to avoid the Condition Forced? Or as soon as we have an action window in the immediate attack the Condition Forced takes place (and in that case can we trigger Responses after that or those are still after the whole attack?) Or some other situation?\n> \n> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n> \n> You can choose which Forced effect to trigger first, but they must both be resolved as soon as possible.
