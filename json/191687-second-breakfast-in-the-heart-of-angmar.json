However, I still like the idea of witches and hags in the traditional mythological sense. No, I'm not speaking of \"cool\" modern witches or mages popularized by World of Warcraft, but rather the old mythological figure of an evil crone constantly plotting ruin, creating bad weather, confusing travellers, etc. I'm talking about Baba Yaga, about the Cailleach, etc, which is actually a very old mythological creature present in pretty much every European culture, and thus I think that it fits nicely in Middle Earth, especially a place like Angmar.

He is not the king of witches nor is he a witch by the standard definition of the word either. So therefore witch seems to simply be a term that can be used when describing those who use magic, especially dark or \"evil\" magic. If I remember correctly at some point Gimli refers to Galadriel as an \"Elf Witch\" (potentially the only other use of the word) and she is CLEARLY not a witch (other than the fact that she uses \"magic\") so this just further backs up this theory. \n\nYes it is not concrete and yes many things about Middle Earth remain mysterious but I think that in this case it is pretty obvious what Tolkien's intent was. \n\nEdited October 21, 2015 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191687-second-breakfast-in-the-heart-of-angmar/?do=findComment&comment=1858031","commentId":1858031,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1445405849,"content":"I think the 'elf witch' comment is only in the movies.   Yeah I think you're right though, the word 'witch' in 'the Witch-king'  would mean 'the sorcerer-king' and not 'the king of witches.'  Still I think it's entirely likely that there are witches (in the modern sense, women who practice magic) in Middle-earth.  \n\n \n\nReally if werewolves were not established cannon, I'm sure we'd call it very silly to put them in a Lord of the Rings-themed game.

It does sound like something that would only be in the movies....\n\n \n\nThere definitely would be women who practise magic in middle earth, they just might be known by other  names more so than the term witch but I do see what you are saying and agree. There are \"witches\" in middle earth it just might not be the most common or fitting term for those beings within the world of Middle Earth. \n\n \n\nFor sure if werewolves were not canon it would be painful to see them but they are so I am incredibly excited to see them!!! You are right though with the whole humanoid thing, they should just be giant savage Wolves if we are to stick to the source material. I guess the main problem with that however is a simple one; wargs. We already have so many goddamn wargs (not to mention a scenario with ONLY wargs and another with ONLY wargs and the watcher) in the game and probably plenty more to come that if they did werewolves as close to the source material as possible their art would be very similar to the many many pieces of art we have seen so far for wargs.\n\nWargs and Werewolves would be indistinguishable other than from their names or if they perhaps showed size in some way in the art for Werewolves showing them as much bigger and nastier. Even then however they would simply be massive versions of the Wargs which would be fitting but potentially a bit stale/unexciting in the context of the game. I think that for the sake of the game this is probably the better direction for them to take even if it is slightly unthematic as it distinguishes between the two quite well.\n\n \n\nAlso you are actually incorrect in that we should be seeing a man transform into a wolf as the werewolves in tolkiens work are VERY VERY different to usual and are really just giant wolves inhabited by evil spirits (perhaps even corrupted Maiar!) that are able to speak and have an intellect similar to that of a man or elf. You will find that the only transforming werewolf was actually Sauron who took the form of a giant wolf (werewolf) at times."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191687-second-breakfast-in-the-heart-of-angmar/?do=findComment&comment=1858057","commentId":1858057,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1445408816,"content":"> I see no problem with witches.
