When I complete it... will it stay on the table, allowing me to infinitely delay advancement to stage 2 of the quest?  Or will it be discarded and go into my discard pile?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278165-completing-multiple-copies-of-limit-1-in-victory-display-side-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3382066","commentId":3382066,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1529685001,"content":"I always presume it will go to the discard pile instead.
