This exploit can prevent all but one of the players from earning it.\n\nIt actually uses a card that was dubbed the \"worst card of the Ring-maker Cycle\" on TftC -- no, not Mirkwood Pioneer -- but Message\n\nFrom Elrond! Each player who wants to pull it off needs a copy of Poisoned Counsels in his hand (Gather Information anyone?) and a copy of Message From Elrond.\n\nOn the last round of the game, in the action window right before the last enemy is killed, each player sends Poisoned Counsels via Message From Elrond to one unlucky player. The Campaign card says that each player with a copy of Poisoned Counsels earns it, not each copy of Poisoned Counsels is earned, so the players who used this trick don't earn it and the player who received all of the cards only earns 1.\n\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts on this.\n\nEdited May 31, 2015 by Ecthelion III"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178860-avoiding-poisoned-counsels-for-all-but-one-of-the-players-at-least/?do=findComment&comment=1643007","commentId":1643007,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1433081786,"content":"That's a fun approach to the problem.  Now the next question is how you decide the unlucky person.\n\n \n\nYou could accomplish the same thing without screwing over one person with several other cards.  For example: Will of the West, Gildor, Wizard Pipe, Ered Nimrais prospector, or White Council.  But none of those are as amusing as your idea :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nEDIT: Disregard my post.  I read the card wrong.\n\nEdited May 31, 2015 by Teamjimby"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178860-avoiding-poisoned-counsels-for-all-but-one-of-the-players-at-least/?do=findComment&comment=1643058","commentId":1643058,"userName":"entMoot","timestamp":1433086376,"content":"> That's a fun approach to the problem.  Now the next question is how you decide the unlucky person.\n> \n>  \n> \n> You could accomplish the same thing without screwing over one person with several other cards.  For example: Will of the West, Gildor, Wizard Pipe, Ered Nimrais prospector, or White Council.  But none of those are as amusing as your idea :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nThe campaign card says that as long as Poisoned Counsels is in a player's hand, deck, or discard pile that they have earned it.
