I also realized that he is our 4th Dwarf hero with 2 more on the way. I then reread the KD box and saw that thematically it is about Dwarves going to investigate what happened to Balin. With this in mind, I am issuing the:\n\nKhazad-Dum Challenge\n\nObjective: In a 2 player game, to go through the 3 Khazad-Dum quests and succeed. (Either normally or Nightmare mode)\n\nRules:\n\n1. All heroes must be a Dwarf.\n\n2. Between the 2 decks, there must be at least 1 copy of each Dwarf and Dwarf-related card.\n\n3. Have fun.\n\nI have issued this challenge to the Cardboard of the Rings podcast and they readily accepted. (Awesome podcast which you can check out here: cardboardoftherings.wordpress.com/ [http://cardboardoftherings.wordpress.com/]). I hope you all enjoy and discuss your triumphs (or tragedies) during this challenge."}]}
