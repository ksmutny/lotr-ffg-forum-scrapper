While you're on course, the encounter deck is pretty neutered.  Ships are easy to leave in the staging area, which makes them good targets for Aragorn to avoid attacks (Boarding still triggers), and it's also great to pull them out of the deck with Dunedain Hunter (Boarding does not trigger).  Pippin's card draw shines in this quest.\n\n \n\nI had Cirdan with Light of Valinor and Narya by turn 2, which was a big deal for combat, as you can have a bunch of enemies engaged at once (some of them with attack as low as 2).  I actually got to use Horn's Cry effectively one turn, although my threat wasn't high enough for the Valour action.  It just let Beorn tank several attacks safely.  \n\n \n\nThe difficulty was low-to-moderate for the decks I brought against this scenario.  Decks with a high ally count should do well, as any characters can sail, you don't need willpower.  Scry could be fairly useful in this quest for determining how many allies to commit to sailing tests.  Or for discarding some cards you don't want to see.  Say you scry 3 cards with Risk Some Light, then find a treachery that you'd like to miss on card 3.  You also find that you only need 1 ally in order to do the sailing test and remain on course.  In a 2-player game, that treachery will now hit you (commit 1 ally for sailing, discard that top card, then reveal the next 2 for regular questing).  You can go ahead and over-commit characters to the sailing test to pick out that dreaded treachery, discarding it harmlessly during your sailing test.\n\nEdited February 15, 2016 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202465-voyage-across-belegaer-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2063033","commentId":2063033,"userName":"Denison","timestamp":1455984135,"content":"Second try with Cirdan/Arwen/Galdor was a breeze in solo.

I actually had a fair bit of trouble with it and it took three attempts to beat. I lost one game and conceded another when things started to deteriorate badly. The game I did manage to win I did so with both Ships on one damage off destruction, enemy ships still engaged and both Heavy Warships in the victory display... it was such a hard slog and such a long game and I only beat it by the absolute slimmest margin.\n\n**** sailing can be hard... at times I get so many symbols, an abundance in fact, and am totally sweet and then at other times just get no symbols at all on like 5 or so cards and am just screwed if particular encounter cards or shadow effects appear.\n\nIts pretty **** fun though!\nI also find the enemy ships pretty brutal considering you can only defend with ship-objectives and they can't be healed or have their defensive stats buffed... its really a battle of attrition as no matter what your ships will take some nasty damage so you have to plan your skirmishes with enemy ships extremely carefully or your ships just take heavy damage so quickly.\n\nIts also hard because the Dream Chaser is so **** handy for sailing tests or questing but its so much safer and better to save it for defense if enemy ships are in play or even just on the horizon. At times it is almost integral for sailing tests though, especially at the start when you don't have many characters in play....\n\n \n\nall in all a great new mechanic albeit one I need to get better at handling for sure..   I do run pretty attachment heavy and ally light decks though which doesn't help with sailing one bit..\n\n \n\noh some of the pirates are **** nasty too.... so much attachment destruction!!!\n\n \n\nWill play the second quest tomorrow!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202465-voyage-across-belegaer-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2074583","commentId":2074583,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1456597720,"content":"I´m playing the quest right now with Elladan/Elrohir/Arwen and Cirdan/Galdor/Glorfindel.

I run lots of weapons and readying attachments so always discard those over a shield or elven mail, managed to discard steward on one occasion only to play a new copy the following turn.\nI'm running Elrohir, Elladan, Tactigorn and Arwen, Elrond, Glorfindel (changed my decks up yet again!) so fairly similar line up. I actually do run x2 Horn's Cry in the tactics/leadership deck and although I only used a copy against enemy ships the once it is pretty useful, the only issue is you need to be above 40 threat or you can only reduce their attack by one rather than 3. It is a nice late game card for sure and could help with the final attack from one of the Warship's for example.\n\n \n\nGod those warships are nasty, at least with a Warden of Healing out buffed by Elrond you can heal the archery damage consistently each turn if you leave it in staging. Its 8 attack is super nasty against your ships (that have 5 defense max!) and then boarding 3 can be really nasty too if you get multiple copies of the pirates that discard attachments and buff themselves or discard a card from your hand and do direct damage based on the cost of the discard card each time they attack.\n\nTactigorn's -1 to enemy defense was pretty helpful against both the pirates and enemy ships and he, Elrohir and powerful allies like Marksman of Lorien and Legolas were easily able to sink enemy ships quickly and effectively towards the end of the quest.\n\nWhat ships are you using?\n\nI use Dream Chaser and Narelenya. I was going to use the ship that lowers starting threat and gives +1 to all heroes and has ranged but that ship has abysmal defense and you can only destroy enemy ships once they are safely defended against by ship-objectives. Feint is amazing on the enemy ships and if you can sink them fast enough this can completely avoid the attacks of a single ship avoiding any damage on your ships.\n\nEdited February 28, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202465-voyage-across-belegaer-spoilers-inside/?do=findComment&comment=2082927","commentId":2082927,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1457032690,"content":"Got my expansion just yesterday, and I just steamrolled this quest first try with my Ents deck (basically the new Seastan ent deck minus Steward and Good Harvest).
