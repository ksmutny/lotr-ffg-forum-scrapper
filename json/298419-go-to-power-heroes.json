As well as in a Legolas and Radagast Eagle deck as a super defender while Legolas is the super attacker. And being able to exhaust for all sorts of effects is still helpful if you play the errata version. We play the original Boromir and he's much more fun and helpful on the more banging your head against a wall hard difficulty quests that exist out there. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298419-go-to-power-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3760591","commentId":3760591,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1565467247,"content":"Usually it Will be Galadriel, Cirdan, Spirfindel (I might change Cirdan to Gandalf)\n\n \n\nAlso Dunedain with Aragorn (either Lore or Tactics), Halbarad, Amarthuil "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/298419-go-to-power-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3765080","commentId":3765080,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1565987680,"content":"My most powerful deck uses Elrond, Arwen, and tactics Eowyn, which I consider to be the strongest heroes in their respective spheres.

It's similar to my solo list \"The Shirebroke\" (https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/11796/theshirebroke-1.0) [https://ringsdb.com/decklist/view/11796/theshirebroke-1.0] but expanded into two decks for consistency.\n\nArwen is the strongest because she's got everything in one package. Spirit access, resource generation, card draw (through Elven-light), high willpower, reasonable threat cost, Noldor trait (for Elrond's Counsel).  I'd put Cirdan at a distant second, followed by Galadriel, then Glorfindel (Eowyn if multiplayer), though Caldara has a argument for being in my second place slot, because like Dain she's crazy good if you devote your whole deck to her."}]}
