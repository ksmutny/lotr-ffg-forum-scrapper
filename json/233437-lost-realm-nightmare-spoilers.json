I swear everytime I see nightmare spoilers I am like: Ok not really nice, but it could be worse and when I get to play one the new card are pure horror :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nI don't remeber Chetwood as a very hard quest once you understood what you are up against, so increased difficulty seems reasonable, but I am unsure if I like to forced Recycling of the sidequest just Imaging everytime you finished saving Iaron he gets captured again! Seems unthematic (he's aveteran ranger after all) and annoying. I guess only playing will tell.\n\n \n\nI have no real memories about the weather hills as it didn't have an outstanding mechanic or seem (except weather...) and I don't really see NM Change that. Yes Cards Focus around damage and healing, but will this make the quest memorable?\n\n \n\nReally have to say I love the Location artworks <3\n\n \n\n \n\nAre you planning on reviewing NM Treason of Saruman, too? Couldn't find any Spoilers for this one, so I would appreciate that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/233437-lost-realm-nightmare-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2478831","commentId":2478831,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1477663344,"content":"My pleasure! yeah the location artwork is just ridiculously good, can't get enough of it!\nHmmmmmm I might one day do reviews for Nightmare Saga quests but for the time being it won't be in the near future.
