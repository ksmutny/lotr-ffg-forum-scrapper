Can I react with Gildor Inglorion to this and search my librabry for a potential \"A Test of Will\" to cancel the effect?\n\n \n\nThank you for your help!\n\n \n\nBy the way: Where is the search function for these forums?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88215-quick-question-react-to-when-revealed-effects/?do=findComment&comment=836261","commentId":836261,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1376163698,"content":"actions can only take place after the effect has taken place. if you want to interrupt a \"when revealed\" effect then you have to use a response\n\n \n\nthe search bar is right at the the top, by the FFG logo\n\nEdited August 10, 2013 by Cunir"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88215-quick-question-react-to-when-revealed-effects/?do=findComment&comment=836314","commentId":836314,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1376168883,"content":"Ah, thanks, that is what I thought / was afraid of...\n\n \n\nThank you, I've found the search bar now.
