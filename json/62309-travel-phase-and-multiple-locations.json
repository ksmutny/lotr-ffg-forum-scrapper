Since that happens, it automatically goes to the discard pile as EXPLORED before the end of the travel phase.\n\nAlso, Strength of Will allows a player to put to progress tokens on a location just traveled to during the actions portion of the travel phase. If you use this and finish exploring a location, it also would go to the discard pile before the end of the travel phase.\n\nNow, the rules never say that you cannot travel to another location in the same phase if this happens, only that you cannot travel to a new location if another is ACTIVE. In either case, can you then travel to a new location before the end of the travel phase?\n\nThanks.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62309-travel-phase-and-multiple-locations/?do=findComment&comment=609972","commentId":609972,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332683678,"content":"im pretty sure you cant do that (though i may be wrong!)....only one location can be travelled to per turn - brown lands=travelled to, so thats it\n\nEDIT- rules state 'may travel to any one location'"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62309-travel-phase-and-multiple-locations/?do=findComment&comment=609973","commentId":609973,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1332684111,"content":"No, this won't work.\n\nThe key phrase is at the start of the first paragraph on p. 15:\n\n\"During the travel phase, the players may travel as a group to any one location in the staging area...\" [emphasis mine]\n\nSo, you are only allowed to \"travel\" to one location per travel phase.

I've been playing card games since MTG hit the shelves, so I'm pretty good at most rules and mechanics (and RPGs since 1986). It was just the way it was written in this one section and then playing with those 2 cards made me think.\n\nThe rest of the rule book is pretty clear, I just would have preferred them to add \"once per round\" or a similar phrase instead of having to interpret the sentence.\n\nThanks again.

Nate has clarified this in at least two separate instances:\n\n(http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications-updated-27012012/page__p__4150#entry4150 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications-updated-27012012/page__p__4150#entry4150])\n\nSo, regardless of the spillover issue, the location's own effect will resolve first and explore The Brown Lands before you can play ANY effects."}]}
