If there isn't any active location in play, the first player chooses one that he wants to travel automatically making that location the active one and triggering it's effect, right?\n\nThen the players send the characters they want there by exhausting them, add their will and compare it against the threat level of all the cards in the staging area (the location they are traveling too isn't there anymore). So what happens next?\n\nIf the players have more will than threat in staging area we add exploration tokens to the location, if we place more tokens than the cost of the location we resolve it and discard it? This will leave us with the option of traveling to a new location the next turn, right?\n\nIf we have more will but don't pass the amount needed in the location then we place tokens and we can't travel to another location until we resolve this one, right?\n\nAnd last but not least, if we have less will than threat in the staging then we don't add any tokens and what happens?\n\nThanks!\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47745-a-little-confused-about-traveling/?do=findComment&comment=478890","commentId":478890,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1306999981,"content":"Firstly, the Travelling phase comes after the Quest phase - other than that you are right in what you are saying.\n\nWhen questing, if the total threat is greater than your committed Willpower, then you raise your Threat dial by the difference.  If you choose not to commit any characters to the quest then you will have a Willpower of 0 when calculating this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47745-a-little-confused-about-traveling/?do=findComment&comment=478917","commentId":478917,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1307002535,"content":"Yes, I know that the quest phase comes first. But now that I think off I have this question:\n\nFirst turn, you quest and add points to the actual quest in case you have more will than threat. Then in your travel phase you select to travel to location #1, making the same check that you did, although with the characters you can and now the check is more easy since the travel location is not adding the threat, right?\n\nThen on the second turn, you quest and if you have more will than the threat level in the staging area you add the tokens to the active location, right? And if that's not enough to overpass the location's level then on your travel phase you can't travel anywhere, right?\n\nThanks!\n\nJavier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47745-a-little-confused-about-traveling/?do=findComment&comment=478923","commentId":478923,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1307003706,"content":"No, travel is just moving a location from the SA to the quest card, and carrying out any forced effects or responses arising from making that card the active location.
