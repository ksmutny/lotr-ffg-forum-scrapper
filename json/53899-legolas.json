From the rules I've read, it seems that participate usually means in conjunction with another character (not necessarily another players' characters) i.e. the ranged description. Normally, I think particpate means \"involved in an attack\" in which would be either scenario descibed above but I'm starting to think the word participate means something more specific in this game.\n\nI think Brand's ability makes more sense where he has to attack an enemy engaged with another player. The ability seems to trigger regardless of whether he attacks alone or with other characters as long as the enemy is engaged with another player.\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53899-legolas/?do=findComment&comment=534628","commentId":534628,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1317297942,"content":"Legolas' ability is any time he kills an enemy.

It doesn't matter how much damage you do or how much overkill, if Legolas participates he can play tokens on the active quest/location. There is no difference in the rules as to who does damage when multiple characters attack together, it's just one big lump sum.\n\nAlso, you must exhaust Legolas to do this, which means he then can't be doing anything else."}]}
