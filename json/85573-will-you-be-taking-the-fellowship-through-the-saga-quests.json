thing i'm most looking forward to in the new \"black riders\" expansion, i think, is being able to take the whole fellowship through it, from start to finish. from bag end all the way to mount doom.\n\ni hope they release some of the heroes as allies too, like they did with all the dwarfs, so we can take all 9 members in just two hands.\n\nplaying the game solo with two hands, and being able to have all nine members together will be great.\n\ni might even order the hands so i can seperate them up when the time comes. so instead of playing the \"black riders\" box two-fisted, i might start it with just one hand -- frodo, sam, merry and pippin (thats why we need them as allies too), and then only start playing two-fisted when they get to rivendell. then we can switch back to one hand when the story demands it, after frodo and sam go their seperate ways.\n\nbeing forced to include the frodo card in quests that dont involve him will be a bit of a bummer,

I'm pretty sure they will use those locations and events for the scenarios of an Adventure Pack cycle like those that emulate numerous events and chapters from the fellowship of the ring (like redhorn gate, watcher in the water, the dead marshes, shadow and flame, etc etc.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85573-will-you-be-taking-the-fellowship-through-the-saga-quests/?do=findComment&comment=806634","commentId":806634,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1372351337,"content":"hopefully

I think he'll only show up where he's meant too and not in any what if's.

Sure, having Elladan and Elrohir fight the watcher in the water and enter Moria is amazing, but I would also like to do it with the fellowship including Frodo bearing the One Ring, and I already know I won't be able to do that."}]}
