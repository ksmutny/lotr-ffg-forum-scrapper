Northern Tracker.  If you Quest him each round, he gets to apply his 1 progress token to every location in the staging area every round, right?  So if he quests three rounds in a row, then he could theoretically do 3 progress tokens to a single location if it was in the Staging Area all three rounds.  is this right?\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63468-dunhere-northern-tracker/?do=findComment&comment=620858","commentId":620858,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1335129195,"content":"gvaughn1 said:\n\n1.  For Dunhere, he can attack an enemy in the Staging Area during the combat phase of the game - and he gets +1 to attack.  I assume this is done with impunity, right?  So the enemy in the Staging Area can't attack him back in any way, shape, or form.  Right?  If so, he is awesome at picking off high level enemies that can't escape the Staging Area.\n\n\n\nCorrect, but please note that Dunhere must do it alone, so if the target enemy has a defense of 3 or more, Dunhere would be useless unless you can boost his attack value.\n\ngvaughn1 said:\n\n2.
