So I was playing Nightmare Foundations of Stone tonight and was wondering if an action I took was legal or not. If you aren't engaged with any enemies, does the combat phase still progress through the normal steps and actions windows that it would if you were engaged with enemies? My thought was: I would activate Cave Torch during the combat phase in the action window after all enemies have attacked. If an enemy popped up, Haldir would be able to kill it. Was this legal? Does the combat phase progress normally even without enemies attacking? Thank you, hope to hear your thoughts!\n\n \n\nHi Chris,\n\nClever solution. If there are no enemies in play, there is still a combat phase. As such, you could declare the “Resolving Enemy Attacks” portion complete after no enemies attack, and then use the Cave Torch during the “Attacking Enemies” portion of the phase.\nWell done!\nCheers,\nCaleb\n\n \n\nIncase anyone was left wondering what the official ruling on the combat phase action window thing was. =)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178758-no-enemies-combat-phase-steps/?do=findComment&comment=1644884","commentId":1644884,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1433196028,"content":"So I guess we're just overthinking all this combat phase action window stuff.  Since we have this ruling here, there seems to be no reason why we should be able to use the Westfold Outrider to take an engaged enemy away from player 2 and avoid that attack, even if it is the only enemy he is engaged with.\n\n \n\nIt's a green bar on the chart at the end of the book, so.. anything goes?\n\nEdited June 1, 2015 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/178758-no-enemies-combat-phase-steps/?do=findComment&comment=1645163","commentId":1645163,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1433217674,"content":"The chart in the back of the book always is a source of confusion for me.

After the first player resolves each of his engaged enemy’s attacks and play passes to the next player, the first player can then discard a Westfold Outrider to engage an enemy engaged with another player.
