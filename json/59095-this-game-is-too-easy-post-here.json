The multiplayer mode is amazing, but for a single player it's simply annoying. Couldn't they made some slight changes, like rising your threat by only 2 instead of 3, rising the players total threat to 60 or editing 3B's text so that I'm able to play cards in the crucial part of the game? Cards like, say GG or Gandalf? Heck, I wouldn't even mind if they had brainwashed one of the Attercops to fight on your side!* So many opportunities to fit this scenario in a single player mode, but they did... nothing?\n\n \n\nRtM has such a challenging encounter deck, but I don't get too experience it because either I get some lucky draws and hurry through the addventure (boring) or I run out of threat and loose just when things get interesting.\n\n \n\n \n\n* still hoping for a card that makes this possible"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59095-this-game-is-too-easy-post-here/?do=findComment&comment=580841","commentId":580841,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326811771,"content":"well, i really think solo gameplay is not the focus of this game.,.. but either way... there is a pretty good custom rule set up that iGaveHimLife made that makes return MUCH mroe fun... there is  discussion of it here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=600394] if you wana try it out and put your 2 cents in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59095-this-game-is-too-easy-post-here/?do=findComment&comment=580846","commentId":580846,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1326812319,"content":"booored said:\n\nwell, i really think solo gameplay is not the focus of this game.,.. but either way... there is a pretty good custom rule set up that iGaveHimLife made that makes return MUCH mroe fun... there is  discussion of it here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=600394] if you wana try it out and put your 2 cents in.\n\n\n\ni dont see anything that takes this game away from the 1-2 player on the box.......its 50/50 in my opinion....only time will tell i guess"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59095-this-game-is-too-easy-post-here/?do=findComment&comment=580910","commentId":580910,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1326819645,"content":"booored said:\n\nwell, i really think solo gameplay is not the focus of this game.,.. but either way... there is a pretty good custom rule set up that iGaveHimLife made that makes return MUCH mroe fun... there is  discussion of it here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=600394] if you wana try it out and put your 2 cents in.\n\n\n\nThanks for posting that link. I think that the suggested rules make sense, I only ask myself why the designers didn't come up with something similar so that I don't feel like I'm cheating by using custom rules. In this case btw it doesn't matter if the focus of the game lies on solo or multiplayer, when they only had to add some minor rule changes to make RtM playable (and more important: enjoyable) for solo players."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59095-this-game-is-too-easy-post-here/?do=findComment&comment=580921","commentId":580921,"userName":"sputang","timestamp":1326821335,"content":"I want to see the fabled deck lists that can supposedly easily defeat Massing at Osgiliath"}]}
