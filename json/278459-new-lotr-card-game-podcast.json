I thought it worked the same way at first but that seemed overly brutal, if Nalir is exhausted he can't even defend and would die immediately! I posted about it on the forums and someone explained how it really works, the treachery simply results in the chosen enemy declaring an attack against the player who controls Nalir not Nalir himself so you can block with any ready character to protect Nalir and keep him alive. If you take the attack undefended however you must place the damage on Nalir. This should hopefully make the quest a lot easier for you in the future!!\n\n \n\nhere is the thread for reference: \n\n \n\nEdited July 27, 2018 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/278459-new-lotr-card-game-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=3416790","commentId":3416790,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1532681545,"content":"Thanks so much for the feedback (It is nice to get some, you are the second to listen and offer it!) and I'm so glad you enjoyed listening to the episodes!\n\n \n\nYou know I hadn't thought about him being exhausted, that's a great point. I feel pretty confident that I interpreted the card in a reasonable way, but it's great to know that it has some additional rulings to make it more balanced. Thanks for taking the time to let me know!  And that quest is definitely on the easier side, but that card has ended the game for me in the past for sure. Nice to know I might have pulled out a victory, most of the time you have an asterix on a victory, now I guess I have an asterix on a defeat!
