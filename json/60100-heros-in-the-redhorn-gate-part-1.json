If they wait four weeks, you may still not buy it; so what's the point? I can't see how that's a problem for people who WANT the new cycle. I'm not bored (no pun intended) with 'old' quests, heck, I only played Return TWICE! But I'm never tired of seeing new stuff; hence the reason I already have 6 custom quests.\n\n \n\nOf course, there is the fact that I bought the entire Mirkwood cycle at once, so I'm not used to wait that long to discover and play a new quest, maybe I'll need more patience from now on.\n\n \n\nTL;DR: I WANT MORE HEROES! sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60100-heros-in-the-redhorn-gate-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=591036","commentId":591036,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1328606249,"content":"cordeirooo said:\n\nTL;DR: I WANT MORE HEROES! sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]\n\n\n\nand i want more noldor elves.........i admit i havnt yet cracked all khazad quests, but its the player cards and nice new artwork im after"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60100-heros-in-the-redhorn-gate-part-1/?do=findComment&comment=591048","commentId":591048,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1328607388,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ncordeirooo said:\n\n \n\nTL;DR: I WANT MORE HEROES! sad.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/sad.gif]\n\n \n\n \n\nand i want more noldor elves.........i admit i havnt yet cracked all khazad quests, but its the player cards and nice new artwork im after\n\n\n\n \n\nMaybe we see a Galadriel Hero card!
