I don't think they are actually made of stone, but rather the word Stone-giants means that they live high up in the mountain, like Cave Troll, which are also not made of caves. But I guess they are just some mindfling of Tolkien that he thought was nice to put in at the moment he wrote it, but propably forgot about it later on. (as with many things) I see them more as Ents, \"We are on nobody their sides\", creatures who have no alliances with anybody, save for maybe the Eagles. Instead of the Ents, these Giants don't get roused, so probably only killed some annoying Goblins in the mountains. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1318913","commentId":1318913,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1414872756,"content":"great thoughts :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] i tend to agree (which echoes my thoughts on your post about skin changers ..which actually gave me the idea for this thread)\n\n \n\nit does make me wonder on that note, why sauron ignored such a valuable assest he could have used (it appears to me at least they werent sophisticated and could have been brought under his control easy enough in time)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319072","commentId":1319072,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1414882966,"content":"I think it's always important to remember that The Hobbit when it was written originally wasn't intended to be part of Tolkien's broader legendarium. So he probably included giants in The Hobbit because they fit the \"fairy tale\" quality of that particular story, but didn't necessarily have a part for them in the broader history of Middle-earth. Of course, Tolkien did like to reconcile certain discrepancies in his work, so it's surprising that he never touched on giants more at some later point. Of course, I haven't read every last piece of Tolkien (the histories of Middle-earth are still waiting for me), so it's possible that the answer lies in there somewhere, but I haven't heard of it. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319076","commentId":1319076,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1414883297,"content":"Since this is the place to ask a question, I guess I'll ask, How much foresight do you think Gandalf had? There are plenty of examples of him making decisions and believing in people when no one else would, and he always seemed to turn out right. Taking a bet on one little Hobbit named Bilbo dramatically changed the course of events, as without Bilbo, the Dwarves would likely have been eaten by Spiders, ended up locked up forever in Thranduil's halls, etc., and the dragon would still have been alive during the War of the Ring. Another example is him insisting on Merry and Pippin's presence in the Fellowship, which seemed absurd at the time, but they went on to play key roles in victory.\n\n \n\nSo did Gandalf just really believe in people, especially the smallest and humble of peoples like Hobbits, and he was able to inspire them to the greatest heights?

He is not of Mankind, and although magic has no role as 'magic' in ME, he has powers, great powers.\n\nBut, if I would try to answer, I think not really. IMO he just does what hr thinks is right and as he says about Bilbo 'he gives me courage'. Gandalf took strenght out of the small, simple deeds, so perhaps he was inspired by Merry and Pippins love and friendship with Frodo and saw a strong bond between them, so he insisted on them joining.\n\nOn the other hand, he seems to know a lot of things already before they are reported to him. Frodo not being dead, Denethor mad. And with things of the Hobbit all the same..\n\nOr maybe it was the Pipeweed. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319200","commentId":1319200,"userName":"Estel Edain","timestamp":1414892083,"content":"When the three hunters meet Gandalf in Fangorn, we get his perspective on a few things. When he learns that Sam accompanied Frodo, he says, \"It is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. Good! Very good! You lighten my heart.\" When he hears of Boromir's death, he answered, \"Poor Boromir! I could not see what happened to him. ...But he escaped in the end. I am glad. It was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for Boromir's sake.\"\n\n \n\nHe then speaks of their peril: \" 'War is upon us and all our friends, a war in which only the use of the Ring could give us surety of victory.' ... He rose and gazed out eastward, shading his eyes, as if he saw things far away that none of them could see. Then he shook his head. 'No,' he said in a soft voice, 'it has gone beyond our reach. Of that at least let us be glad. We can no longer be tempted to use the Ring.\"\n\n \n\nFinally he speaks to Aragorn's seemingly useless choice to attempt rescuing Merry and Pippin: \"You chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice was just, and it has been rewarded. For so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met too late.\"\n\n \n\nIt seems clear that Gandalf sees more than others, yet much remains hidden to him. He has a sense of what is right in different circumstances, and for the rest he trusts to fate, like he tells Bilbo at the end of the Hobbit: \"Surely you don't disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself? You don't really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole benefit? You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!\"\n\n \n\nThis fits with Tolkien's idea of eucatastrophe. Gandalf seems helpless in the Battle of the Five Armies, ready for a last blast of magic, and then the Eagles come. I don't think he has clear foresight, but he's open to allowing fate to work, rather than trying to account for everything in the designs of the wise."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319253","commentId":1319253,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1414896393,"content":"Great answer, Estel Edain! That pretty much aligns with  my own thinking: he has some measure of foresight, but not total knowledge (and I agree with you too, Mndela, that if total knowledge were the case, it would be boring!). I like how this contrasts with Saruman. Saruman did not have faith in others, and so he sought total knowledge and total foreknowledge, even at the cost of dabbling in the arts of the Enemy. Gandalf, by contrast, seems to hold onto hope and be willing to leave some matters up to destiny and higher powers, making decisions based on his own wisdom and intuition rather than using something like the Palantir. At times, this makes it seem like he succeeded mostly on luck, but as referenced in that passage you quoted from the end of the Hobbit, it's more about faith in others and the ultimate triumph of good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319342","commentId":1319342,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1414910886,"content":"In the Book of Lost tales there are mentions on Giants, even names for them.

We do not.”\n \n\n“For even the very wise cannot see all ends.” \n\nThese two quotes suggested at least that Gandalf had some kind of foresight, but that he ´could not see all ends´, so it wasn´t any great power I think.\n \n\nAnd again a hint of foresight:\n\n “You take after Bilbo,' said Gandalf. 'There is more about you than meets the eye, as I said of him long ago.' Frodo wondered if the remark meant more than it said.”\n\n \n\nEspecially about the Bilbo question:\n\n\"I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure, and it's very difficult to find anyone.' \n'I should think so, in these parts. We're plain, quiet folk and have no use for adventures. Nasty, disturbing, uncomfortable things, they make you late for dinner.” \n\n \n\nIt has not so much to do with foresight, but 1. this could be a diversive tactic to lure Bilbo into the quest or 2. the 'very difficult' was true and Gandalf choose Bilbo rather by change than foresight.\n\n \n\nAbout Gandalf's Folly:\n\n “Still that must be expected,' said Gandalf to himself. 'He is not half through yet, and to what he will come in the end not even Elrond can foretell. Not to evil, I think. He may become like a glass filled with a clear light for eyes to see that can.”\n\n \n\nAs I read it here, Elrond had more foreseeiing powers than Gandalf, but 'not even' would suggest that Gandalf had some himself.\n\nEdited November 2, 2014 by gandalfDK"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1319811","commentId":1319811,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1414961872,"content":"GandalfDK, when you finally get your hands on Unfinished Tales, you're going to love it, if only for the chapter called The Quest of Erebor, in which Gandalf explains to the members of the Fellowship of the Ring after the War of the Ring how and why he came to push Thorin to take Bilbo on his expedition to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Unfinished Tales contains excerpts from different drafts of the story. \n\n \n\nGandalf admits to having some sort of \"foresight,\" that he \"feels it deep in his heart,\" that the quest will only succeed if Thorin takes Bilbo along… and this is based on Gandalf remembering having met Bilbo when he was a child, and on rumours he had heard about him while travelling through the Shire (at a time when Bilbo was away, \"off again\"), which made him sound promising to Gandalf. So he had not seen \"adult Bilbo\" yet when he insisted that Thorin take Bilbo with him (the Dwarves should take a Hobbit along, he argued, for Smaug would not recognize the scent of a Hobbit, whereas he would that of a Dwarf or other known enemies… and Gandalf supported the Dwarves' quest to reclaim Erebor and slay Smaug, for he feared that Sauron could make an ally of the dragon).\n\n \n\n \n\n\"I know your fame,\" Thorin answered. \"I hope it is merited. But this foolish business of your hobbit makes me wonder whether it is foresight that is on you, and you are not crazed rather than foreseeing. So many cares may have disordered your wits.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nIn another draft, Gandalf answers questions about why he chose Bilbo for the quest to Erebor:\n\n \n\n\"And anyway you must begin at some point, with some one person. I dare say he was \"chosen\" and I was only chosen to choose him; but I picked out  Bilbo.\"\n\n \n\n'How would you select any one Hobbit for such a purpose?' said Gandalf. 'I had not time to sort them all out; but I knew the Shire very well and by that time, although when I met Thorin I had been away for more than twenty years on less pleasant business. So naturally thinking over the Hobbits that I knew, I said to myself: \"I want a dash of the Took\" (but not too much, Master Peregrin) \"and I want a good foundation of the stolider sort, a Baggins perhaps.\" That pointed at once to Bilbo. And I had known him once very well, almost up to his coming of age, better than he knew me. I liked him then. And now I found that he was \"unattached\" -- to jump on again, for of course I did not know all this until I went back to the Shire. I learned that he had never married. I thought that odd, though I guessed why it was; and the reason I guessed was not the one that most Hobbits gave me: that he had early been left very well by his own master. No, I guessed that he wanted to remain \"unattached\" for some reason deep down which he did not understand himself -- or would not acknowledge, for it alarmed him. He wanted, all the same, to be free to go when the chance came, or he had made up his courage. I remembered how he used to pester me with questions when he was a youngster about the Hobbits that had occasionally \"gone off\", as they said in the Shire. There were at least two of his uncles on the Took side that had done so.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nSo in the above excerpt, we see that Gandalf is a psychologist relying heavily on intuition, rather than definite foresight :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] … as confirmed by the following excerpt:\n\n \n\n \n\n\"'So I rode off back to Thorin in haste, to tackle the difficult task of persuading him to put aside his lofty designs [to take Erebor by force with a small army of Dwarves] and go secretly -- and take Bilbo with him. Without seeing Bilbo first. It was a mistake, and nearly proved disastrous. For Bilbo had changed, of course. At least, he was getting rather greedy and fat, and his old desires had dwindled down to a sort of private dream. Nothing could have been more dismaying than to find it actually in danger of coming true! He was altogether bewildered, and made a complete fool of himself. Thorin would have left in a rage, but for another strange chance, which I will mention in a moment.\"\n\n \n\nWith regards to the \"mistake\" that \"nearly proved disastrous,\" Gandalf says:\n\n \n\n\"'It was on the morning of Tuesday, April 25th 2941, that I called to see Bilbo; and though I knew more or less what to expect, I must say that my confidence was shaken. I saw that things would be far more difficult than I had thought. But I persevered. Next day, Wednesday, April the 26th, I brought Thorin and his companions to Bag End; with great difficulty so far as Thorin was concerned -- he hung back to the last. And of course Bilbo was completely bewildered and behaved ridiculously. Everything in fact when extremely badly for me from the beginning; and that unfortunate business about the \"professional third\", which the Dwarves had got firmly in their heads, only made matters worse…\"\n\n \n\nAnother relevant excerpt/explanation from Gandalf with regards to foresight/fate:\n\n \n\n \n\n\"In that distant time I said to a small and frightened hobbit [Frodo]: Bilbo was meant to find the ring, and not by its maker, and you therefore were meant to bear it. And I might have added: and I was meant to guide you both to those points.\n\n\"To do that I used in my waking mind only such means as were allowed to me, doing what lay to my hand according to such reasons as I had. But what I knew in my heart, or knew before I stepped on those grey shores: that is another matter. Olórin I was in the West that is forgotten, and only to those who are there shall I speak more openly.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nIn the essay on The Istari in Unfinished Tales, J.R.R. Tolkien writes:\n\n \n\n \n\nEmissaries they [the 5 Istari] were from the Lords of the West, the Valar, who still took counsel for the governance of Middle-earth, and when the shadow of Sauron first began to stir again took this means of resisting him. For with the consent of Eru they they sent members of their own high order, but clad in bodies of Men, real and not feigned, but subject to the fears and pains and weariness of earth, able to hunger and thirst and be slain; though because of their noble spirits they did not die, and aged only by the cares and labours of many years. And this the Valar did, desiring to amend the the errors of old, especially that they had attempted to guard and seclude the Eldar by their own might and glory fully revealed; whereas now their emissaries were forbidden to reveal themselves in forms of majesty, or to seek to rule the wills of Men or Elves by open display of power, but coming in shapes weak and humble were bidden to advise and persuade Men and Elves to good, and to seek to unite in love and understanding all those whom Sauron, should he come again, would endeavour to dominate and corrupt […]\"\n\n \n\n\"For it is said that being embodies the Istari had need to learn much anew by slow experience, and though they knew whence they came the memory of the Blessed Realm was to them a vision from afar off, for which (so long as they remained true to their mission) they yearned exceedingly. Thus by enduring of free will the pangs of exile and the deceits of Sauron they might address the evils of that time.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nChristopher Tolkien remarks in the essay on The Istari:\n\n \n\n\"Most of the remaining writings about the Istari (as a group) are unhappily no more than very rapid jottings, often illegible. Of major interest, however, is a very brief and hasty sketch of a narrative, telling of a council of the Valar, summoned it seems by Manwë ('and maybe he was called upon by Eru for counsel?'), at which it was resolved to send out three emissaries to Middle-earth. 'Who would go? For they must be mighty, peers of Sauron, but must forgo might, and clothe themselves in flesh so as to treat on equality and win the trust of Elves and Men. But this would imperil them, dimming their wisdom and knowledge, and confusing them with fears, cares, and wearinesses coming from the flesh.' But only two came forward: Curumo [a.k.a. Saruman], who was chosen by Aulë, and Alatar [one of the Blue Wizards], who was sent by Oromë. Then Manwë asked, where was Olórin? And Olórin, who was clad in grey, and having just entered from a journey seated himself at the edge of the council, asked what Manwë would have of him. Manwë replied that he wished Olórin to go as the third messenger to Middle-earth (and it is remarked that 'Olórin was a lover of the Eldar that remained,' apparently to explain Manwë's choice). But Olórin replied that he was too weak for such a task, and that he feared Sauron.Then Manwë said that that was all the more reason why he should go […]\"\n\n \n\n\"[…] The meaning of these relations between Istari and Valar is clearly, in light of the brief narrative just cited, that each Istar was chosen by each  Vala for his innate characteristics -- perhaps even that they were members of the 'people' of that Vala, in the same sense as is said of Sauron in  the Valaquenta (The Silmarillion) that in the beginning he was of the Maiar of Aulë, and he remained might in the lore of that people.'\"\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nAll of the above suggests to me that as a result of his ancient roots and connection with one of the Valar, Gandalf might have some insights into possible/likely futures. His limited ability to foretell future events also would have been a combination of intuition and deduction derived over a millennia of observing mortal/Elvish behaviour in Middle Earth (though as indicated in the second last spoiler, as an Istar, he had to \"learn much anew by slow experience\"). Aside from that, Gandalf does seem to believe in Fate (the inevitable outcome of the music of the Valar that created the world in the Silmarillion?) or discrete divine intervention leading things in a certain direction, though that fate can be altered through the (unanticipated) actions of mortals and immortals alike ('for even the very wise cannot see all ends').  \n\n \n\nAll this of course being a long-winded answer that essentially supports what Estel Edain and Gandalf DK have already suggested in prior posts…  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited November 2, 2014 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1321289","commentId":1321289,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1415053509,"content":"As I waited for the Gandalf debate late replies, which I judge have now had the ttime to come, I would like to ask some other questions.\n\nI was just reading the Apendices A- About the Dwarves and I always wonder about a couple of things:\n\n1.

They may not necessarily have a fëa (soul) or at least not one that goes anywhere and simply dies with their hröa. Therefore they aren't all that important in the grand scheme of things and are just another creature, albiet a very humanoid one and probably one far cleverer than simple animals and most probably with sentience of some sort. Perhaps they are some sort of original experiment or project by Eru before he created his children, maybe he was just experimenting with appearance, size and nature and made the Giants but without fëa. He may have then left them in this primal state and decided that elves and men should be far smaller in stature but of a similar form. As far as Sauron using them perhaps they were too high in the mountains and too volatile for it to be worthwhile. I'm sure he could have brought them under his control if he tried hard enough/used enough forces to do so but the Giants may have taken out many orcs in the process so it might have just not been worth it especially when he already had armored Olog-Hai. Just my two cents :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nAs far as the origin of the Orcs I'm not sure why their longevity was one of Tolkiens main concerns if they were indeed created from Tortured/Corrupted Elves as the loss of immortality could easily be explained as a side effect of being so cruelly and fully misshapen and tortured. Morgoth was able to infuse middle earth ITSELF and its various elements (gold, silver, water etc etc etc) with his own essence meaning that every being and place had the potential for corruption or greed. He is almost like corruption incarnate really so I can see him infusing the tortured and twisted elves with parts of his own being and essence which would surely effect and remove their gift of immortality and seems to have also been so full on that they were considered from that point on a different species. \n\nMerely disfiguring and torturing the elves into looking like the orcs do and breaking them mentally would not result in their offspring being the same either so obviously Morgoths essense or will being infused into them must have been what twisted them into a new race. So he hasn't created life but has rather corrupted an existing group of beings into a new type of being.\n\nEdited November 5, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1322957","commentId":1322957,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1415157943,"content":"Holy cuss, I had a long and brilliant response typed up when a link got accidentally clicked. \n\n \n\nIn short: could Giants have been ('internally', that is in the context of the story within the fictional narrative) an invention of Bilbo wanting to spice up his memoirs?\n\n \n\nAnd, Elrond could easily have claimed kingship over the remaining High Elves had he wanted to, even if his heritage was not as closely linked to the original Nolodorin lords of the First Age, simply because (1) he was so wise and revered and (2) his father was Eärendil.\n\n \n\nIf I get bold enough I'll post again with a fuller explanation :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1323023","commentId":1323023,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1415164323,"content":"> Holy cuss, I had a In short: could Giants have been ('internally', that is in the context of the story within the fictional narrative) an invention of Bilbo wanting to spice up his memoirs?\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nThis is my own headcanon as to why The Hobbit is written so differently from The Lord of the Rings and for some of the discrepancies (why the Elves act so differently, the appearance of giants, etc.), all these differences reflect Bilbo's style as a storyteller and some of his poetic license."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1323033","commentId":1323033,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1415165344,"content":"That's a pretty cool way of looking at it and interesting theory.

They are not easy to work into the theory and system.\n\n \n\n(1) As the case of Aule and the Dwarves shows, only Eru could make creatures with independent wills, and with reasoning powers. But Orcs seem to have both: they can try to cheat Morgoth/Sauron, rebel against him, or criticize him.\n\n \n\n(2) ? Therefore they must be corruptions of something pre-existing.\n\n \n\n(3) But Men had not yet appeared, when the Orcs had already existed. Aule constructed the Dwarves out of his memory of the Music; but Eru would not sanction the work of Melkor so as to allow the independence of the Orcs. (Not unless Orcs were ultimately remediable, or could be amended and 'saved'?)\n\n \n\nIt also seems clear (see 'Finrod and Andreth') that though Melkor could utterly corrupt and ruin individuals, it is not possible to comtemplate his absolute perversion of a whole people, or group of peoples, and his making that state heritable.\n\n \n\nIn that case Elves, as a source, are very unlikely. And are Orcs 'immortal', in the Elvish sense? Or trolls? It seems clearly implied in The Lord of the Rings that trolls existed in their own right, but were 'tinkered' with by Melkor.\n\n \n\nEmphasis mine. \n\n \n\nThis is a question of what you consider canon and not. Surely the Silmarillion should be considered canon, but so should the History of Middle-Earth, and that was published much later and had new ideas that Tolkien had not fully worked out when he wrote the early legends. When these two contradict each other, what are we to believe? I guess we could each decide for ourselves. It seems that Tolkien eventually did not intend for orcs to be related to elves, but died before he could make a final ruling on it.\n\nEdited November 5, 2014 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1323552","commentId":1323552,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1415208976,"content":"And thus we have the earliest known \"retcon.\"  Well, those writings are very theoretical, so as you say it is a question or what you consider canon.  The passage you cite is hardly \"history,\" but rather a \"notes scrawled in the margin\" type of finding, in the process of arriving at a place that Tolkien unfortunately never arrived.\n\n \n\nI would say it's too bold to say that Tolkien \"scrapped\" that idea of Orcs being bred from Elves.  He was clearly not satisfied with that, but in the end left us with only one account of their origin in prose that was intended for other people's eyes.\n\nEdited November 5, 2014 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1323575","commentId":1323575,"userName":"Djenni","timestamp":1415210505,"content":"> And thus we have the earliest known \"retcon.\"  Well, those writings are very theoretical, so as you say it is a question or what you consider canon.  The passage you cite is hardly \"history,\" but rather a \"notes scrawled in the margin\" type of finding, in the process of arriving at a place that Tolkien unfortunately never arrived.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I would say it's too bold to say that Tolkien \"scrapped\" that idea of Orcs being bred from Elves.  He was clearly not satisfied with that, but in the end left us with only one account of their origin in prose that was intended for other people's eyes.\n\nAgreed. Given what text we have between our hands - this is the only logical conclusion. Perhaps if Tolkien had lived longer and had more time to work on this we would have seen something different.

I was wondering, because after the Hobbit, he doesn't really get any attention. (It may be in the UT, but I have yet to read that (very quickly!)) Also I was wondering because I hoped he didn't so that there would be some Elves left in ME and his kingdom wouldn't be left to rot in Angband too, because Thranduil did not posses a Ring of Power, which would mean his realm wasn't dependend on its powe, so therefore non in it would then suddenly 'fall'.\n\n \n\nAs for Elrond becoming High King, I don't think he would have wanted such a title for himself. I see Elrond more in the way of a  puppiteer (hope it is translated well), the one in the back pulling some ropes. Ropes in the form of guided advice. And what I meant with my earlier post, the High King of the Noldor wouldn't rule over Lorien or Mirkwood, so why should he even take such a title? All other Elves west of the Misty Mountains are already under his control.\n\n \n\nRich, I was about to post a similair question. \n\n \n\nBut I know some things about Rhûn. It has never been visited by Gandalf indeed and Aragorn once, but also Saruman and the two Blue Wizards travelled there. As we know, the Blue Wizards (Alatar and Pallando) stayed. My guess is that Gandalf just didn't have any business there and rather trusted Alatar and Pallando to solve matters there. Aragorn has probably travelled there to learn his 'enemy'. What are their principals and manners of living? He had to become a wise ruler and strength in war is found in knowing your enemy (scrying ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]), and also learning to respect other people for the choices they (have to/forced to) make. \n\n \n\nRhûn is supposedly somewhat like Mongolia, but we actually don't know. There is a Sea in the middle of Rhûn, the Sea of Rhûn, so probably the climate around that area wasn't so bad. They have fought against Gondor mostly on horses (Wainraider) what also shows a connection to Atilla the Hun from Mongolia and rather not as the film depictes as mostly spearman. \n\n \n\nRhûn is inhabitated by Dwarfs, Men and Elves. All live originates from Rhûn; In the far east of Rhûn is where the first Elves and Men woke up. Two groups of 'lost' Elves remained there, the ones we call Dark Elves and they resisted or rather ignored the Call (see above in other post for explanation). Also in the mountains that lie in the far east, 4 of the 7 Dwarf clans live there. That almost everything we know about those Dwarves. But the main group of inhabitants are Men, also know as Easterlings.  \n\n \n\nIt is suggested to be ruled by several kings, who were head of a tribe, so no unification, only if one king could rise up and claim command. Somewhat like in old Mongolia. The Easterlings have fought many wars with the West, under the service of Sauron and under themselfs. During the Wainraider invasion, they were united under 1 banner by a strong leader and so could assemble a force to almost conquer Gondor. (Eorl saved them luckily) In the Thirth Age, many of the several tribeleaders swore oaths to Sauron and their main army attacked Erebor and Dale In the Fourth Age Aragorn and his son subdued them in their wars against them, and probably made peace after several victories, when they had shown the new strenght of Gondor and Rohan.\n\n \n\nWe know not much about them.

In a way, I'm glad Tolkien left unfinished. He passed before he could suck. Think about how many artists, musicians, writers, film-makers, etc, who just drag things on for way too long.

The Dwarves once had a large colony in the Grey Mountains (Durin's Folk, I think in the Second age? perhaps the First age as well?) but due to constant attack from dragons in general they migrated to (if I can remember correctly) The Iron Hills and Erebor and abandoned all their mines and strongholds etc. Then Smaug (who I'm pretty sure is from the Withered Heath and only a few thousand years old and not at all created by Morgoth) came down to Erebor and took it for himself.\n\n \n\nSo there are almost definitely still some dragons left as the Grey Mountains were utterly abandoned by the third age by the Dwarves and I doubt anyone ventured up there specifically to slay dragons. They are probably only Colddrakes which are much smaller than Firedrakes (Smaug is one of these).\n\nConsidering that The Lost Realm and Angmar Awakened are taking place in the area that was once Arnor and Angmar (which is at the Western most point of the Grey Mountains and very far from the Withered Heath) I doubt there will be any dragons or drakes in that cycle. I guess that there could be some in Western parts of the Grey Mountains though... especially in the third age where there are no dwarves left to eat on the Eastern end!\n\nEdited November 8, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1326497","commentId":1326497,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1415417896,"content":"watchtower_on_the_heath_by_jonhodgson-d4 [http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2012/096/0/3/watchtower_on_the_heath_by_jonhodgson-d4v61xr.jpg]I found this awesome picture from The One Ring RPG that depicts a Dwarven Watch Tower in the Withered Heath that has been abandoned for a long time.

My personal thought is that they diminished in power after Morgoth was defeated, and/or the most powerful ones were destroyed in the War of Wrath. The word 'worm' is used in later ages (as in Scatha the Worm) so I expect those dragons were more like Glaurung in that they could not fly, and so were somewhat more manageable.

So, as you say, I don't see why there would not be different strands of wargs. One of the distinctions between wargs and plain old wolves is that wargs are more intelligent and able to speak their own language. With that in mind, I don't see why there wouldn't be different 'cultures' almost, in the same way that we see distinctions between the orcs of, say, Mordor and the orcs of Mountains -- both in appearance and ways.\n\n \n\n> What are Fell Beasts? (if they even really carry that name?)\n> \n> What creatures towed Grond to the gates of Minas Tirith?\n> \n> How many different kind of Olog-Hai are there?\n> \n> What happened to all the creatures commanded by Sauron after his defeat?\n> \n> Especially to the werewolves, as Gandalf suggested (somewhere?) they survived into the Third Age.\n\n \n\nI've always taken the Fell Beasts to be Sauron's lesser version of the dragons. If the dragons were bred by Morgoth, surely Sauron would want to mimic his master. So he tried to make winged creatures of terror but fell short of the mark, being a lesser person than the real Enemy.\n\n \n\nI think the same applies to the rest of Sauron's servants. They are evil creatures, probably mutilated and reformed by Sauron from wild animals of distant lands that we don't see in the texts. Maybe oliphaunts? As such they were all, either in spirit or by fear, bound to Sauron. When the Ring is destroyed the orcs and trolls and the rest all flee in terror; we can assume any other critters did the same. I would expect that most found some quiet corner of Mordor or elsewhere to hide and brood in much the same way that the Balrogs (and, I suppose, the werewolves) did after the War of Wrath, there to lie in wait for adventurers of later tabletop games to engage.\n\n \n\nThe Orcs and Trolls are slightly different in that they seem to have their own ways when they are not under the direct subjugation of the Shadow. So, like the bits we get from three trolls of The Hobbit and the Grishnak in Rings, I think the orcs and trolls 'setup shop' on their own terms. Robbing, killing, and so on, to their own liking and independently.\n\n \n\nAs far the types of trolls, I have no idea. The One Ring RPG has a few different classifications like Stone-trolls, Hill-trolls, Cave-trolls, Bog-trolls, and so on. I would refer back to we said about the orcs and wargs -- the differences are largely in appearance with mild variances in their ways. They are still the same 'people'.\n\n \n\nSo there's a wide shot, but hopefully it's helpful :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n> Does someone know what 'earth' or 'ground' would be in Sindarin?\n\nTalaf, maybe?\n\n \n\nhttp://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-en-sd.html [http://www.jrrvf.com/hisweloke/sindar/online/sindar/dict-en-sd.html]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126151-tolkien-lore-q-a/?do=findComment&comment=1335670","commentId":1335670,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1416076731,"content":"Thanks shipwreck!\n\nI was hoping you would answer my Sindarin question!\n\n \n\nHmm, thank you for your answer on the Wargs.

For more on this, look at Master of Lore's great article: https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-eagles-are-coming/ [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2013/03/18/the-eagles-are-coming/]\n \nAt several key moments in the Lord of the Rings, Varda or Elbereth's name is invoked, and it clearly has power. At Weathertop, the Witch-king gives a shrill cry after Frodo calls out \"O Elbereth! Gilthoniel!\" The Witch-king magically silences Frodo when he invokes her name at the Ford of Bruinen. Legolas invokes Elbereth before his mighty shot that kills the Nazgûl's fell beast while travelling down the Anduin. Sam and Frodo use her name and the Phial of Galadriel to get past the Watchers and escape Cirith Ungol. Most significantly, when Shelob is about to kill Sam,\n\n> a thought came to him, as if some remote voice had spoken, and he fumbled in his breast with his left hand, and found...the Phial of Galadriel.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> And then his tongue was loosed and his voice cried in a language which he did not know:\n> A Elbereth Gilthoniel\n> o menel palan-diriel,\n> le nallon sí di'nguruthos!\n> A tiro nin, Fanuilos!\n\n \n\nNotice the passive voice, which leaves the source ambiguous: \"a thought came\" and \"his tongue was loosed.\" In letter 278, Tolkien translated Sam's invocation as:\n\n>  O Elbereth Starkindler from heaven gazing-afar, to thee I cry now in the shadow of (the fear of) death. O look towards me, Everwhite.\n\n \n\nSam then confronted Shelob with the Phial, which burns her deeply and drives her away (earlier, the Phial had only temporarily rebuffed her):\n\n>  It flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light.\n\n \n\nThat definitely seems like an intervention by Varda Starkindler. It's similar to Sam asking Galadriel for rope after climbing down a cliff in Emyn Muil (and the knot comes undone), and for light and water in Mordor (which they get).\n\n \n\nThe Valar's interventions in the Third Age are generally indirect, as Arda becomes less explicitly magical, but they fit into the broader picture of \"luck\" helping those who persevere in virtue.\n\nEdited December 7, 2015 by Estel Edain"}]}
