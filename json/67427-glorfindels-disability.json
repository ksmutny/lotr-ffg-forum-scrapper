I would now like to share one aspect of it that may not have been discussed. And that is the \"usefulness\" of the forced effect. In our coop games, we've been starting with the initial threat levels of 24 (player controlling Glorfindel) and 25. It has proven useful on quite a few occasions to raise the threat of the Glorfindel player to equal up to the other player on round 1. It allows for more strategy options, the most obvious being the Snaga Scouts in MaO or Caught in a Web. Thus we often opt not to play Light of Valinor on round 1 even when we already have the card.\n\nps: For similar (and more potent) strategic reasons (and the beautiful art) I am a big fan of the Song of Earendil but I currently cannot find place for it in the two decks we run…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67427-glorfindels-disability/?do=findComment&comment=657916","commentId":657916,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1342149687,"content":"In solo play it can be helpful if you're threat is already 30+ and you have one or more Goblin Scouts in the staging area. It's easier to raise your threat by two each round to get quickly to 37 than to get it down to 24.\n\nIn general I think the forced effect isn't that terrible once your threat is 30+ points. Most of the enemies would engage you anyway, and it's way too difficult to trigger the secrecy keyword (unless you have Loragorn)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67427-glorfindels-disability/?do=findComment&comment=658011","commentId":658011,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1342168228,"content":"In mu opinion most cheeting card in the game.

Tracker is pure baby against Asfaloth. This card is crazy powerful! Even MIO i can win now quite easy.\n\nOk sure i will not use him for my deck building in currently metagame. He is just broke everything. I can see already 2 decks\n\nGlorifindel/ Aragorn/ Denethor.\n\nBeravur/ Legolas/Eowyn.  \n\nThose 2 deck can win any quest MIO included.

I play lot of card games  before: Magic, Decipher Lotr, Desipher Star wars, Desipher Wars, Middle earth ccg but i never see such a briliant game idea as a lotr lcg and for me is pain to see how game go more and more casual style.\n\nAmong all this casual players at least i happy we have here players like Leptokurt, Bohemond, Radiskull, Narsil, Juicebox.

Important is you have 2 heroes in my deck Glor and Arogorn they are quest for 5 and ready for attack 6. From the begin!!! Try my deck please and you will see! I try play like Glor still cost 12 threat.

Since it's not a competitive game, you can build your decks to play casual or try something out that might be more of a challenge or thematic. I know my wife probably wouldn't be begging me to play every night if we weren't winning the majority of the time because that's what she enjoys. When I play by myself I can experiment some with other types of decks and I really don't care if I lose. I just enjoy playing the game and the challenge of figuring out how many different combinations I come up with the combat these quests. There are enough competitive \"professional\" card player games out there to keep you at bay if that's your thing. Here's to hoping this game just continues to introduce fun quests and card mechanics we can all enjoy (although I would love some better tactics cards)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67427-glorfindels-disability/?do=findComment&comment=658049","commentId":658049,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1342175054,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\nHe's very strong, but not overpowered.

Glorfindel is stupidly powerful when combined with Asfaloth and Light of Valinor. Sure, you have to start out with LoV in your hand. If you mulligan for the card (and if you are playing Glorfindel, you almost always should), that means you start out with the card about 58% of all games. If you include Runes you increase your odds considerably. In the 40 or so test games I ran with my Glorfindel deck, there were only a couple occasions that I didn’t get the card in play by turn 3.\n\nAnd a 5 cost hero who quests for 3 without tapping, attacks for three and has 5 health is far superior to Bifur plus any other attachment of your choice. And that’s in comparison to Bifur, one of the most powerful heroes on in the whole game.\n\nOf course Frodo is powerful with 4 or five 5 attachments, but so what? That takes a ton of card draw and resources and he still isn’t as good as Beravor with half as many attachments.\n\nI urge you to run some tests with the new Glorfindel. Use my deck, use one of Glarung’s decks. GLorfindel and his attachments are game breaking. Now, as Valyrian Steel said, that may not be a bad thing, but we shouldn’t be disputing the power level of this combination of cards. It’s off the charts.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67427-glorfindels-disability/?do=findComment&comment=658066","commentId":658066,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1342176958,"content":"Hey, I've seen pleanty of losses while playing with Glorfindel.

them in that regard…and I throw in the songs (most of them) as they can generate me some revenue if I have the right cards + rivendell minstrel.\n\n \n\nBut I digress.\n\n \n\nThe heroes we use:  Loragon, Glorfindel, Frodo.   I've often considered swapping out Frodo and I'm going to try Denethor as someone has suggested.  Glorfindel with his new gigs is indeed powerful, but I honestly don't see how one hero wins anything.  Most enemies which cause problems have 3-5 armor and Glorfindel attacks with a 3.  In the beginning, he can really help with questing, but some missions are oriented towards swarming you with enemies so his role does vary from mission to mission.  Asfaloth, in my mind is probably the one card I do enjoy having…but so is fast hitch for Frodo.  Have I ever considered reducing my deck?  Nah.\n\n \n\nThis deck is a four sphere deck.  Song of battle is in there so I can get Glorfindel the sword and bow.  And other songs are added in order to get unique items for Loragon.  There are also things to support Frodo, etc.\n\nAll in all, even with my statistically inferior deck (when compared to the 50 card decks), I wholly enjoy playing this game and I'm winning more than I'm losing, (however I swear a lot when playing Escape from Dol Goldur and I don't usually win that one…in fact, I think I've only won it once)\n\nI spam Glorfindel and use Frodo to absorb damage and my threat shoots from 24 to 48 in no time flat…but I don't care…it is all part of the early game strategy to reduce damage and I just use Loragon to reset and then after the reset, you play a little more tight to the chest.\n\nMy son's deck is also a ton of fun, and THIS is what I like about this game is the synergies between cards.  Due to the latest series, there has been a lot of focus on dwarves, of course, so he has an all dwarven party.  His favorite missions are when he can bring in all dwarven allies (his deck literally has nothing but dwarves in it) and then use the battlemaster to kill a troll in one fell swoop, or use his cards to commit everyone to defense or to the quest and then refresh them and pummel them into oblivion.\n\nHis heroes are Gimli, Dain, and Gloin.\n\n \n\nThe synergies with his deck and mine are fantastic…as I often purchase items for him and he will do likewise.  Gloin committed to quests (with Dain's ability) is very helpful and Gimli tends to play the same as Glorfindel…quest early and then attack later.\n\nAnywho, we are probably noobs in the grand scheme, but we enjoy the game tremendously.  We get lazy, though, we never change our decks…his is 70+ and that is how we like it. \n\n \n\nThe synergies and the figuring out how to work together to overcome something difficult is what I enjoy.  Some of the quests are awful, especially the gollum ones because I really dislike it when I \"lose instantly\" or \"can't attack this turn\".  Those are hokey game elements to me.  I personally wish there were ways to create 3 or 4 decks and have even more synergies. \n\nA game I enjoy playing is Shadows over Camelot…yes, I know that Battlestar Galactica is supposed to be better, but it frankly isn't if you play with 6 or more people and we like to actually finish within an hour, although the traitor mechanics are nicer.  The point I'm making is that cooperative games are fantastic.  And I've seen some great designs which make games difficult.  I just wish they could get more epic in their scope.  I want to command 12 heroes, not just three.  I want to have broad expanses and linked quests…not some hokey nightmare mode.   That is what I want…but I really am quite happy with what I have.\n\nThanks for listening, and happy playing!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67427-glorfindels-disability/?do=findComment&comment=658673","commentId":658673,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1342322362,"content":"leptokurt said:\n\nI will play some more games, perhaps against other scenarios too, to properly  evaluate this deck. So far I like it, although it seems to be a bit vulnerable against enemies in the first couple of rounds. And I would always choose Westroad Traveler over Riddermark's Finest. Or more copies of Arwen.\n\n\n\nAs much as I like the new Strider (and I had initially thought the new Glorfindel is tailor-made for him) I experience Beravor as a better option. The card draw still rocks for my games.

I have a little bit of trouble in the games where i don't draw an early LOV, but for the most part, Glorfindel (spirit) rocks. I would say the the cost analysis for him is a bit off. I often read that he should cost 7 more threat (as befitting his stats) but this is obviously a mistake. Unlike most of the other top tier heroes, Glorfindel (spirit) is all stats, he doesn't have any cool special actions or abilities.  That's gotta count for something, right?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67427-glorfindels-disability/?do=findComment&comment=658820","commentId":658820,"userName":"Quit2","timestamp":1342359117,"content":"I've read alot of people's writing about how the new glorfindel is overpowered. However, when I see the card on it's own, the stats, the threat cost, the lack of a useful ability, the presence of a penalty, he does not look overpowered on first sight. Also, all the time when people write about how he is overpowered, they write about light of valinor and Asfaloth.\n\nThat made me think. I have now tested the new glorfindel without light of valinor, and without asfaloth. I have been testing with the old glorfindel and both attachments, and I have been testing with the twins and the light of valinor. (in a deck with the twins and Eowin)\n\nThe conclusion I came to is this: the new glorfindel is good. Very good. But not overpowered. Asfaloth is also a very good card, when played on a glorfindel it's in the range of northern tracker. The card that is more than very good is the light of valinor. It is not so much overpowered on a twin, but it is on any of both glorfindels: quest for 3 and attack for 3 is very good. It does the same as unexpected courage at half the price. And the real aspect of overpowered comes when you combine the new glorfindel with light of valinor. In that case, not only do you have an unexpected courage at half the price, you also get to ignore the penalty on glorfindel.\n\nSo my conclusion: \nSpirit Glorfindel is a very good hero, like there are other very good heroes. \nLight of Valinor borders to being overpowered when combined with the right hero (Lore Glorfindel)\nThe combination of Spirit Glorfindel and Light of Valinor is overpowered in my eyes. With overpowered I mean: is much more powerful than any other combination of 2 cards in this game.\n\nAs a bonus: Since you are likely combining Spirit Glorfindel with a Lore hero for Asfaloth anyway, Daeron's Runes is a very good card to go fetch a Light of Valinor if you don't hold it in your opening hand. It also gives you something to do with a second copy of any of the unique attachments. And it costs 0!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67427-glorfindels-disability/?do=findComment&comment=659256","commentId":659256,"userName":"Serazu","timestamp":1342434512,"content":"So true about the Light.
