Those treacheries were generally pretty benign, so replacing them usually wasn't worth it.

Still, I don't know that it's entirely useless. Locations with high threat values that aren't worth traveling to--Rocky Craig, East Wall of Rohan, etc.--might make good targets, as might those with particularly back-breaking effects based on a particular board position (Pelennor Fields, perhaps). It's situational, to be sure, but there will be a few corner cases in which it has value.\n\nIn other words, it's not great, but it's no Meneldor's Flight."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63687-full-pic-spoilers-up/?do=findComment&comment=624488","commentId":624488,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1335864156,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nTitan said:\n\n \n\n \n\nSpecially because you have to shuffle the deck, then reveal the new card.

Along with the player cards, there are several encounter cards that are simply stunning. Disturbed Waters is probably my personal favorite, although Doors of Durin and Stair Falls are also really well done.\n\nIf I recall correctly, LotR was recently nominated for The Dice Tower's \"Best Art\" award, among other accolades. This pack is just another reminder why. The game may have some inconsistencies and rules kinks that need to be polished, but the art direction has been top-notch from day one. \n\nIn other words, those tentacles may obliterate your party, but darn it if they don't look mighty pretty while doing so happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"}]}
