Just is in process. I still need one or two months where i work on it in my free times\n\n2. RingsDB is going to release a very amazing weblog in a few\n\n3. I am not professional, and seems PHP (the language code behind) is weak about security. I don't know all the aspects about how to blind and protect my php web from attacks. And it is important if people trusts me and use name of users and passwords inside.\n\n4. I can work in a free host and a free database. However, it is free, and we can't  know how database work when thousand of files where inside, if it runs slower or even it chrases. Or simply, it stops being free and demands some kinda of payment.\n\n.... the images i post in this forum are real built by real php, it is not photoshop, but the program web is not online, just in my localhost\n\nEdited October 10, 2016 by Mndela"}]}
