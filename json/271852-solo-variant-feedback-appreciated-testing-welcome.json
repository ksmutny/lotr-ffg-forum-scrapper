You might change the resource rule to instead read, \"At the start of the Resource Phase, choose a hero.

This comes at the negative of a 60-card deck, but I kind of feel that the added setup time allowed by the first benefit is going to far outweigh this drawback, even without redesigning a build to take advantage of the accelerated cost curves.\n\nMono-sphere is probably disproportionately buffed, from all the Record attachments to Pelargir Shipwright to Caldara to Mithrandir's Advice (although this last one is mitigated by the increased deck size).\n\nStill, it's an interesting idea, much in keeping with previous attempts to field more than 3 heroes in true solo but in a cleaner fashion than the other tries I've seen."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271852-solo-variant-feedback-appreciated-testing-welcome/?do=findComment&comment=3255939","commentId":3255939,"userName":"BigKahuna","timestamp":1521620506,"content":"> Quote\n> \n> I took it to mean that of your 4 heroes, only 3 collect resources during the first Resource phase.\n\nThis is correct.\n\n> Quote\n> \n> I'm assuming you meant \"+10 engagement cost\", not \"+10 threat\"…?\n\nAlso correct\n\nOne general thing I'm considering for the variant is make it scale to the difficulty of the quest.  The trouble with that is that the official difficulty rating and actual difficulty are.. well lets just say, not always on the money.   In any case, I like to do a lot of testing before I apply additional changes, though I do agree with that Mono Sphere decks might be getting too much of an advantage here (I will run some quests this week with some mono decks to see how that holds up).  It may be necessary to require a minimum of 2 spheres with this variant.\n\nThanks for all the great responses, I will post an update in a while after I do more testing.  I plan to also write a instruction book for the rule set and post high resolution printable cards for proxy use in the future."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271852-solo-variant-feedback-appreciated-testing-welcome/?do=findComment&comment=3256316","commentId":3256316,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1521646551,"content":"Playing with 4 heroes really change the whole games.

The point is not to \"make insane decks\" by optimizing the **** out of the build, but to offer new possibilities for creative deck-building combinations that otherwise wouldn't be feasible. For example, wouldn't it be fun to take the original four Hobbits -- Merry, Pippin, Sam, and Frodo -- on a non-saga quest? If having four heroes enables an OP combo that trivializes the game, then simply don't use those cards when playing this variant. It's a homemade way to adjust the difficulty curve in any case, and the deck-builder has all the flexibility in the world to experiment with which difficulty balance seems most fun and interesting to him or her. I think this is a creative, intuitive, and fun option. Not for everyone, of course, but then again, that's why mods exist!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271852-solo-variant-feedback-appreciated-testing-welcome/?do=findComment&comment=3257889","commentId":3257889,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1521747120,"content":"I don't have any relevant things to say until bigkahuna discuss about abuse potential of playing mono sphere.
