I prefer Mr. Underhill to Gildor boon. I put Noble hero on Sam because my goal was to turn Sam into a total beast. With that boon he quests for 4 and can equip both Sting and Anduil. All the quests, including the POD quests were pretty easy and I had minimal burdens (ring draws them and eaten alive). Then I had to face the Balrog and my team was not so good. I lost a ton and experimented with all kinds of different decks. I wanted to kill the Balrog and then bring a hero back with fate and fortune, but I could never pull it off. Then (after finding out about beyond all hope) I finally killed the Balrog by having Sam die. I replaced Sam with Eowyn and then replaced the fellowship Aragorn with the new spirit Theoden. Pippen was taken captive and easily recovered by Rohan. Then Sam came back with some serious power :-) and sent Eowyn home. I was able to defeat Helm's Deep but I have not yet been able to destroy Isengard. Spirit Theoden is amazing (especially with his sword!), but I don't like tri-color so I may have to cut Pippen or Theoden. I haven't decided yet.

Elladan had a dagger of his own as well as wingfoot so was questing and attacking. Haldir had Glamdring, Rivendell Blade, Intimidation and Valiant Warrior attached so was taking out any enemy I please in one shot each turn (usually before it could attack that round giving me many extra feints) and drawing an extra card for the questing deck with each kill. Elrohir had steward and shield as well as arwens boost and forewarning so could defend against anything and between forewarned and Haldir sniping foes before they attack I was able to minimize shadow cards and effects massively.\n\nA single Warden of Healing working overtime (even using resources to ready him on a few rounds for double healing) was able to constantly heal me to safe levels of damage.\n\nCrushed it without using up Phial of Galadriel this time so even though I am playing on without earning Noble Hero back I at least still have the Phial this time!\n\nSam really proved his worth in that single game alone taking out more foes than Elladan! Pretty stoked with my results.\n\nI then went on to re do Road to Isengard and beat that second attempt and was able to avoid Voice of Saruman this time and earn only the Palantir. Back up to date and although I have wasted Noble Hero I still have my Phial this time and also avoided Voice of Saruman as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175090-your-campaign-so-far-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1614745","commentId":1614745,"userName":"entMoot","timestamp":1431313697,"content":"> entMoot - those are some long games!\n\nThe 110 rounds should be read as points coming from rounds.

This was just what we needed, because we planned to sacrifice Glorfindel on the Great Bridge (it's not the most cost-efficient hero to sacrifice, but he's the only one of the six heroes that felt expandable to both our decks strategies). Fortunately, that Balrog was only missing 5 damages to die, and it's a near thematic win, as Glorfindel is the Balrog slayer (well maybe not, depends on the source I know).\n \nIdraen came back in the second deck. Breaking of the Fellowship was pretty tough, on our first attempt we made the mistake of waiting too long to clear the first quest stage and we had something like 13 Archery to deal with, so basically everybody died. We won on our second attempt but it was a close call, Merry and Pippin killing an Uruk-hai Captain that would otherwise have killed Aragorn. We explored the Sight of Seeing on our last turn so we dropped the Overcome by Grief burden, which is really cool. We had to use the two Galadriel gifts we chose (Three Golden Hairs and Leaf-wrapped Lembas).\n \nWe chose Pippin and Sam to be taken captives, but honestly, we may go back and choose other heroes, depending on what we're going to do next.\nHow do everyone cope with the fact that you actually can't change heroes for free at the beginning of The Uruk-hai? That seems unthematic, because during Breaking of the Fellowship scenario, Frodo choose to go with the Halbarad/Idraen/Sam deck. And now we must take Halabarad and Idraen to rescue Sam and Pippin alongside Aragorn and Merry?\n \nBut who the hell is with Frodo right now??\n \nWe're thinking of doing it a bit differently from what it's intended to be, with RegisF and his Halbarad/Idraen/Sam following Frodo in the marshes (playing the quest solo) to be joined then by me with a brand new deck when Ithilien is reached.\nAnd of course myself solo-playing The Uruk-hai to rescue Pippin and be joined by RegisF with a brand new deck for the Helm's Deep scenario.\n \nWhat do you think?\n \n \nBreaking of the Fellowship\n \n\n2 players\nTotal score of the campaign: 1134\n\n * A Shadow of the Past: 170\n * The Old Forest: 103\n * Fog on the Barrow-Downs: 113\n * A Knife in the Dark: 130\n * Flight to the Ford: 120\n * The Ring Goes South: 203\n * Journey in the Dark: 125\n * Breaking of the Fellowship: 170\n\nPlayers\n\n+1 starting threat for both players\nThe Ring-bearer\n\n * Frodo Baggins (Fellowship) - Mr Underhill\n\nRegisF\n\n * Idraen (Spirit)\n\n * Halbarad (Leadership) - Skilled Healer\n * Sam Gamgee (Leadership) - Captive\n\nbanania\n\n * Merry (Tactics)\n\n * Pippin (Lore) - Noble Hero - Captive\n * Aragorn (Tactics)\n\nCampaign Pool\nBoons\n\n * Mithril Shirt\n * Glamdring\n * Andúril\n\n * Sting\n\n * Old Bogey Stories\n\nBurdens\n\n * Overcome by Terror\n * The Ring Draws Them\n * Pursued by the Enemy\n * Ill Fate\n\nFallen heroes\n\n * Glorfindel (Spirit)\n\nGenerated by the Online Campaign Log [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com/campaignlog/] by banania."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/175090-your-campaign-so-far-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1886532","commentId":1886532,"userName":"RegisF","timestamp":1447091466,"content":"I may confess that Blood of Numenor was pretty stunning.

For most of the scenarios, the first attempt was a win - Journey in the dark, breaking of the fellowship were the two exceptions.\n\n\n \n\n\nErkenbrand played the main defender, and he was boosted by Tireless ranger giving him a starting +1 defence. This also gave him the ranger trait, allowing forewarned later in the campaign. Eowyn was the main quester, with Noble hero and leader of men making her even better at doing that. Gandalf and his toys were useful, and allowed me access to warden of healing to keep my heroes alive.\n\n\n \n\n\nIn some games, I got Heregruim and snowmane on Eowyn (In addition to her permanent boons), so that she quested for 5, earned a resource, readied and attacked for 6 (with optional boosting). Who needs a tactics Eowyn?\n\n\n \n\n\nI initially chose Erkenbrand as a thematic defender, though he's never been a favourite - now I think he's a great card. He saved several games that would have otherwise been lost. I also used The Day's Rising on him, so he could earn resources when his ability wasn't needed - which became more frequent after the addition of Forewarned.  Heir of Mardil went on theodred so he could quest, and still be available for combat.\n\n\n \n\n\nGandalf is Gandalf - what more needs be said? He had his full set of toys.\n\n\n \n\n\nTheoden and Eomer were also solid. Eomer generally had Firefoot, and with a lot of rohan ally recursion going on with Gamling, had his combat boost most rounds.\n\n\n \n\n\nI've always liked Rohan decks, and with the latest Rohan cards, they seem to be working very well now.\n\n\nEdited February 7, 2016 by CaffeineAddict"}]}
