I know there is the one on steam, but it would be amazing if they made a direct copy of this game into digital format, because it has so much depth to it, and it's easy to forget so many little details of each card when playing. ðŸ˜›"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308848-will-a-direct-clone-digital-version-of-this-game-ever-come-to-be/?do=findComment&comment=3947362","commentId":3947362,"userName":"TrueLolzor","timestamp":1591005608,"content":"It would be amazing.
