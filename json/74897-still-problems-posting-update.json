I have not received anything back but if I do I will let you know.\n \nYou can try updating your software (operating system, browser) although I am sure that this not helped in my case (I think FFG updated their code and it solved my issue). \n \nAs for other things send messages to FFG (contact form should work for you) and describe your problem. Maybe they are just not aware of your particular issue? Or maybe if they get flooded by reports they will start working on it. \n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74897-still-problems-posting-update/?do=findComment&comment=731340","commentId":731340,"userName":"Poe4","timestamp":1354889463,"content":"I have not been able to post for the past week or so, but just discovered that it works now.

I'm now posting this via safari from my iPad. So I think the problem is solved. I got an answer back from the webmaster about a week after all is began. I tried what he suggested and posted back as it didn't help. This I about a week ago. I never got a second answer but ow it seems to work. Though I think FFG should have answered the mails I'm also quiet happy that they maybe used their resources to fix the problem instead of continue using time to answer all the mails. So in a way, kudos to FFG :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nand to you rich as well, thanks for being our spokesman while we where unabled :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
