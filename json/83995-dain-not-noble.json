Gloin had the noble trait but Dain did not. Did they make an errata about this? Or is Dain not suppose to have the noble trait? If not, its fine, but it really doesn't make much sense thematically. I thought Dain was a king.\n\nThanks in advance,\n\nHollow "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83995-dain-not-noble/?do=findComment&comment=796498","commentId":796498,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1368838265,"content":"yeah that was noticed at the time when he was released. i think it was just a mistake…as far as i know there is no errata on him\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83995-dain-not-noble/?do=findComment&comment=796665","commentId":796665,"userName":"Hollowbandit","timestamp":1368891474,"content":"Cool thanks rich I just wanted to make sure that I was playing the right way.\n\n \n\nHollow"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83995-dain-not-noble/?do=findComment&comment=796666","commentId":796666,"userName":"Hollowbandit","timestamp":1368891524,"content":"Cool thanks rich, I just wanted to make sure that I was playing the right way.\n\n \n\nHollow"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83995-dain-not-noble/?do=findComment&comment=796684","commentId":796684,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1368896254,"content":"I'd like to suggest that even at the time they realised Dain was broken, and letting him access to other traits for free was just too much.\n\nAlthough the noble trait isn't developed very much we've started to see hints of it getting support.

Denethor didn't interact with other free peoples.. Imrahill also. \n\n \n\nThey are noble because of their birth…\n\n \n\nAlso because he was not the rightfull heir of the King of Dwarves title.. He was Thorin's cousin and the line went on Thorin's side of the family… Although i do not dispute that he was a direct descendant from Durin I"}]}
