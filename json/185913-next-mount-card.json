My guess is that we will get Leadership Hasufel, which is fairly possible when you consider unique mounts so far have the sphere of one incarnation of the hero it belongs to in the story. I guess he could also be Lore or Tactics, but 1: Leadership is the only sphere to lack a unique mount and 2: Core Aragorn is still a prominent hero and the most representative of him as a whole, IMO. \n\n \n\nOn the other hand, we could get a mount related event kinda like Ent-moot or The Eagles are Coming, but I think it's just less likely than an actual new mount."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185913-next-mount-card/?do=findComment&comment=1749988","commentId":1749988,"userName":"Nosilloc","timestamp":1440297538,"content":"We already have an ally that searches for mounts.
