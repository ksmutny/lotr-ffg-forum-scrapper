I still think it is worth a rule clarificartion, as it is the kind of rule that they allow for it gives them freedom in designing new cards. Still I think the argument that it ISN'T like this is strong... I havv't got Kaz yet but aparently there is a 2 card  surge card in that and the 2nd surge is a when reveal effect.... so we HAVE seen a 2 card surge card that dose not use \"surge x\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58654-hoem-double-surge/?do=findComment&comment=577300","commentId":577300,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1326178201,"content":"jhaelen said:\n\nguciomir said:\n\n \n\nSomeone could post a question to FFG so we will know for sure.

Frankly, if I hadn't ever heard the question, I never would have thought of it myself, I came down so strong on the side of \"Surge is Surge, not Surge X\" (As opposed to other rules clarifications, like whether Thalin has his effect before Surge can occur, where I could see arguments either way) Because I was so strong on one side, it just feels \"wrong\" to me, even knowing the source of the interpretation.\n\nIt's much the same as Stand and Fight.

There seems to be a tendency of interpreting rules in the most counter-intuitive way possible. The latest set in CoC has also suffered from a couple of odd card texts.\n\n \n\nI guess, it's a good thing FFG decided they wanted to hire an additional LCG card designer.
