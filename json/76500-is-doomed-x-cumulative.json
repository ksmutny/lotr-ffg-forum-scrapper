Do players have to raise their threat by 1 or 2 (total amount of Doomed value)?\n\nIn short, is Doomed a cumulative keyword or multiple instances of it are redundant, such as giving Sentinel to a character with Sentinel?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76500-is-doomed-x-cumulative/?do=findComment&comment=740950","commentId":740950,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1356944901,"content":"Sadly, yes.             "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76500-is-doomed-x-cumulative/?do=findComment&comment=740994","commentId":740994,"userName":"mr_pelle","timestamp":1356950560,"content":"muemakan said:\n\nSadly, yes.             \n\n\n\nJust as I thought.. =P\n\nThank you very much for the clarification!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76500-is-doomed-x-cumulative/?do=findComment&comment=741016","commentId":741016,"userName":"NotAZombie","timestamp":1356953451,"content":"Here is how I've interpereted it, and this would have some consequences: Say a card already has doomed 1, then a different card makes it gain doomed 1, rather than having doomed 2, it has doomed 1 twice, as separate keywords, so you raise your threat by 1 twice rather than raising it by 2 once. This would functionally make no differece as it being cumulative, except when you have a card like Elfhelm in play, in the cumulative case, you would still raise your threat by one, in the case I describe there would be no threat increase because the doomed keywords trigger separately. This is how it works on some other card games, not sure if it works like that here though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76500-is-doomed-x-cumulative/?do=findComment&comment=742216","commentId":742216,"userName":"TheDisturbed1","timestamp":1357211781,"content":"Each and every time a Doomed [X] card comes up, you need to raise your threat by the appropriate amount.
