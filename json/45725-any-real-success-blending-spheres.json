The healing helped, but I wasn't really any more successful than before. Keep in mind I only have 1 core set currently.. 2 more will arrive tomorrow. Anyone come across any great combinations from different spheres?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45725-any-real-success-blending-spheres/?do=findComment&comment=458589","commentId":458589,"userName":"Tarnis Phoenix","timestamp":1303693879,"content":" I successfully run a tri-sphere (Leader/Spirit/Lore) and Solo quite well\n\n\n\nTri-Sphere: 0 Threat\n\n \n\nHero (3)\n\nBeravor (Core) x1\n\nAragorn (Core) x1\n\nEowyn (Core) x1\n\n \n\n \n\nAlly (13)\n\nDaughter of the Nimrodel (Core) x1\n\nGandalf (Core) x3\n\nGuard of the Citadel (Core) x2\n\nHenamarth Riversong (Core) x2\n\nLorien Guide (Core) x3\n\nNorthern Tracker (Core) x2\n\n \n\n \n\nAttachment (17)\n\nCelebrian's Stone (Core) x3\n\nSteward of Gondor (Core) x3\n\nForest Snare (Core) x3\n\nSelf Preservation (Core) x3\n\nThe Favor of the Lady (Core) x2\n\nUnexpected Courage (Core) x3\n\n \n\n \n\nEvent (23)\n\nA Test of Will (Core) x3\n\nDwarven Tomb (Core) x3\n\nHasty Stroke (Core) x3\n\nRadagast's Cunning (Core) x2\n\nSecret Paths (Core) x2\n\nSneak Attack (Core) x3\n\nStand and Fight (Core) x3\n\nThe Galadhrim's Greeting (Core) x3\n\nValiant Sacrifice (Core) x1\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45725-any-real-success-blending-spheres/?do=findComment&comment=458600","commentId":458600,"userName":"Ahzrab","timestamp":1303695999,"content":"I don't know about this deck, kinda luck based against the hill troll?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45725-any-real-success-blending-spheres/?do=findComment&comment=458634","commentId":458634,"userName":"DerBarchen","timestamp":1303705146,"content":"I had a tough Leadership/Spirit deck with Aaragorn, Eowyn and Theodred. Basically Theodred quests with Eowyn to increase her resource production, Aragorn can always take that attatchment that gives him a Spirit resource sphere and then you just play Wandering Tooks and Guards of the Citadel/Snowborn etc. to sponge enemy attacks while you hold out for Unexpected Courage (on Aragorn) and Sneak Attack/Stand and Fight with Gandalf. I won the 2nd quest with it with 37 points so it was good, but not perfect!"}]}
