It depends what decision they made this summer for Khazad-Dum: print it as often as the core set or print it in similar numbers as the APs... if its the latter case, it will be annoying as the usual AP-hunt I'm afraid"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56954-will-khazad-be-better-available-or-will-it-sell-out/?do=findComment&comment=562124","commentId":562124,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1322656202,"content":"thats a real shame if it is, there will be alot of dissapointed people"}]}
