I myself have been working hard on completing the archetype list with some of the non-trait mechanics that you can build your deck around.\n\nYou can find my new Guarded article here: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2019/09/16/guarded-cards/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2019/09/16/guarded-cards/]\nand the Doomed mechanic article here: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2019/09/19/doomed/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2019/09/19/doomed/]\n\nSince the blog will reach the 100k views this year very soon, as well as the 150k overall views, I will be making another Q&A article where you can ask any questions you may have for the blog or for me. Feel free to ask any questions you have and I will be posting the answers somewhere in 2 weeks time. There have already been a couple of great questions, but I could use some more for a full article: https://forms.gle/pMmAhNP4nuxWQWRm8 [https://forms.gle/pMmAhNP4nuxWQWRm8]\n\nOther than that, I hope to speak to you all soon when we have completed the Dream-chaser cycle in full. Looking forward to seeing some people for Con of the Rings in 2 weeks. Come look me up, I'll have some swag for you!\n\nDurins_Father"}]}
