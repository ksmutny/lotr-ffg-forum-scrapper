But I don't take it that literal, for two reasons: First, the wording of Grimbeorn is other than Wilyador (join vs. gain control). If they wanted the same behaviour, FFG would have chosen the same text. Second, in the sheet for Carrock, no change of control of Grimbeorn is mentioned, in contrast to the sheet for AJtR, where they explain that Wilyador always is controlled by the first player and thus changes control.\n\n(Perhaps it would've been better to make the text \"When Grimbeorn the Old has 8 ... he joins...\" to indicate that it is a one-time joining and he stays with that player).\n\nGreetings,\n\nPete"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54069-wilyador-and-grimbeorn/?do=findComment&comment=535973","commentId":535973,"userName":"Metropolis Games","timestamp":1317570793,"content":"I'd say Wilyador is carried along by whoever happens to be first player at the time like the baton in a relay race and Grimbeorn remains with the player he \"joined.\" So far, I've only played solo so it hasn't been an issue for me - I don't even know what I did with my \"First Player\" token!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54069-wilyador-and-grimbeorn/?do=findComment&comment=536022","commentId":536022,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1317579007,"content":"I assume they move to whoever is the current first player each turn. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54069-wilyador-and-grimbeorn/?do=findComment&comment=536031","commentId":536031,"userName":"Frayed","timestamp":1317580279,"content":" I agree that they follow the first player token."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54069-wilyador-and-grimbeorn/?do=findComment&comment=536058","commentId":536058,"userName":"xBeakeRx","timestamp":1317587286,"content":"The way I interpretted it is that Wilyador changes control each turn to whoever controls the first player token and that Grimbeorn stays with whoever is first player once the 8th resource token is placed on him.  Nowhere in the text does it indicate he changes control from turn-to-turn, whereas Wilyador does."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54069-wilyador-and-grimbeorn/?do=findComment&comment=536062","commentId":536062,"userName":"Veybo","timestamp":1317588128,"content":"My playing group also came accross this issue the first time we played \"A Journey to Rhosgobel\".\n\nI ruled at the time that Wilyador would stay in control of whomever is the first player on the first turn, for the entire game.\n\nI compared Wilyador to some current cards in the game such as \"Unexpected Courage\".  That cards first line of text is \"Attach to a hero\".  There is no Forced, Response or any other text qualifier prior to this text and its text resolution is only performed at the time it is played.\n\nNot sure what the intent of Wilyador was when he was created, but until we hear otherwise this is how my group will be playing this card.\n\nHappy to hear other peoples thoughts on this.\n\nCheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54069-wilyador-and-grimbeorn/?do=findComment&comment=536070","commentId":536070,"userName":"xBeakeRx","timestamp":1317591284,"content":"After looking over the cards again, I believe that both cards follow the first player around"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54069-wilyador-and-grimbeorn/?do=findComment&comment=536121","commentId":536121,"userName":"marlow4","timestamp":1317601789,"content":" The papers that come with the Adventure packs explain:\n\nRe: Wilyador - \"This card has a constant effect that reads, 'The first player gains control of Wilyador, as an ally.'

Next to just referring to the AP sheet, I tried to find something in the game mechanics to prove this reasoning wrong. But I really couldn't gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif] A search in LotR rules and FAQ also dind't yield anything. But I found this in the CoC FAQ, p. 3:\n\"Attachments\nCards with the Attachment subtype are followed by the term in the card text box “Attach to X.” (For example, attach to a character you control). This term is not a card effect, but rather an additional requirement to play the card. The requirement must be met, regardless of if the Attachment enters play from hand or through a card effect.\"\nSo \"Attach to X\" is not the same type of effect as Wilyador's effect (it's no effect at all), and so it's no problem that Wilyador changes its controller every turn. Because both games were designed by Nate French, and the mechanics seem to be similar, I think this errata will be applicable for LotR. Perhaps this CoC errata will be interesting for you, too."}]}
