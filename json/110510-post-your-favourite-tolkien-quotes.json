I am he that buries his friends alive and drowns them and draws them alive again from the water. I came from the end of a bag, but no bag went over me. I am the friend of bears and the guest of eagles. I am Ringwinner and Luckwearer; and I am Barrel-rider.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110510-post-your-favourite-tolkien-quotes/?do=findComment&comment=1150083","commentId":1150083,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1405011617,"content":"Can't believe I haven't seen this one:\n\n \n\n''If more of us valued food and cheer and song above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world.\"\n\n \n\nIt's a pretty good one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110510-post-your-favourite-tolkien-quotes/?do=findComment&comment=1150123","commentId":1150123,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1405013071,"content":"indeed! a wise man Tolkien was :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110510-post-your-favourite-tolkien-quotes/?do=findComment&comment=1150130","commentId":1150130,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1405013411,"content":"\"Even the smallest person can change the course of the future.\"\n\n\"All that is gold does not glitter.
