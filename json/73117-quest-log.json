We have logged all of them. I also use the log to keep track of which heroes are underused and which we tend to use all the time.\n\nFor multiplayer games we just note in the comments field who we played with. When all the players do that, we can retrieve a total record of the played multiplayer games if we wish to by logging into all the accounts and find the game.\n\nI think it is a great tool that could be made even better but probably won't."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73117-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=714430","commentId":714430,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1351085024,"content":"GrandSpleen said:\n\n \n\nYou can select up to 3 heroes.  You can only select heroes for one player, though.\n\n\n\nWhen I tried it, the first weeks it came out, you could only select one.
