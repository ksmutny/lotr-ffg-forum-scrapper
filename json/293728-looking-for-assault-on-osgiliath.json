It’s the last one I need to finish that particular cycle.

There are some very nice cards on there for a ranger deck. I love the scenario too! It's one of my favorites! Unfortunately, I have no leads on getting one, however, if my memory serves, it's been I while since that cycle was reprinted; so hopefully soon! I certainly hope so because I need the first two packs to finish the cycle and they've both got some cards that I'd love to have."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293728-looking-for-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=3674610","commentId":3674610,"userName":"player4036658","timestamp":1554981911,"content":"It is odd that just Morgul Vale is in the \"awaiting reprint\" section of FGG,.

I'm 100% sure the outer case is supposed to be paper (thick paper but paper none the less)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293728-looking-for-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=3707155","commentId":3707155,"userName":"Felswrath","timestamp":1558553314,"content":"> 19 hours ago, chumbathewumba said:\n> \n> It isn't a cardboard box, its paper with cardboard inside to protect the cards.
