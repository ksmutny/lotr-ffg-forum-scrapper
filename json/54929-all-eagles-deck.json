And should I use every eagle card?\n\n\n\n \n\nI've been trying to make one work.\n\nCurrently I'm using Legolas, Thalin, and Dunhere.\n\nBetween Thalin,  Dunher,e and Descendant of Thorondor (and also a couple of Beorning Beekeepers), my goal is to kill most monsters while they're still in the staging area. The Spirit cards I included are all about lowering threat and helping to explore locations, but even so I haven't been able to really make it work (not in solo play at least), it just doesn't have enough Questing strength. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54929-all-eagles-deck/?do=findComment&comment=543687","commentId":543687,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1318931671,"content":"I posted this deck earlier:\n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=563642 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=563642]\n\nIt has all Eagles + Radagast, its Tactics plus a bit Leadership."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54929-all-eagles-deck/?do=findComment&comment=543696","commentId":543696,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1318932758,"content":" I've only got one Core set."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54929-all-eagles-deck/?do=findComment&comment=543703","commentId":543703,"userName":"Shelfwear","timestamp":1318933796,"content":"No problem, just use other cards of the same sphere and same cost instead for all cards you dont own.

Most people consider 50 cards as the standard minimum deck size. If you dont have enough cards or dont feel comfortable with it, just change the deck size."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54929-all-eagles-deck/?do=findComment&comment=543750","commentId":543750,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1318941862,"content":"50 is the MINIMUM size.
