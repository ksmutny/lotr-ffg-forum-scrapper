If you are not going to get a lot of cards, then getting the base set, and Khazad-dum with one or two adventure packs that just have difficultu level that suits your plaing style is just fine. The combos that you could get are not so important if you are not playing competative! Just grab those big deluxe sets and look for the difficultu level of interesting adventure packs.\n\n "}]}
