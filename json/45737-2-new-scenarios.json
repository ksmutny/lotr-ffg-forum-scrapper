The concepts are solid and they seem doable but challanging (especially the multiplayer one)\nThe only falws Id like to point out is that some of the rules for the solo quest are a little ambigous or, erm, unofficial? For example \"also take out Legolas\" kind of gives away that its home made, no offence =P\n\nMore importantly \"carry out the staging element every other turn\" is poorly worded. I assume you mean every 2nd turn? Also do you mean the whole staging step is skipped or that its still in the Quest-phase framework but you simply dont stage enemy cards? This might not be that important now but what if in later expansions we get Staging Actions? Get what I mean?\n\nThe 2nd scenario is worded a little strange too. The first time I read it I thought that Legolas only came in for that scenario, then I realised it means that he comes in and only provides resources of your chosen sphere. Maybe just get rid of \"for this adventure only\"?\n\nThe only other inconsistancy I noticed is that in the last scenario the ork that the player searches for isnt random. This means that players will have no incentive (apart from their desired level of difficulty) to pick a stronger enemy than they have to. I assume this is modeled on the Spiders of Mirkwood thing where you can look for any spider? That works because players have a choice between taking out Ungoliant's Spawn Now and confront it (to beat the quest) or leave it till later because at the time its too strong and take out a weak spider instead, hoping theyll be recovered by the time the Spawn comes out. Your scenario doesnt have that choice. Maybe if you introduced a mandatory boss encounter? (Like a Beastmaster or Chieftan Uthnak) or just made the ork selection random? Ie. \"Take out all the ork enemies from the encounter deck and pick one at random, replace the rest into the deck and shuffle it\"\n\nWow, sorry, I didnt meant to poke this many holes! I honestly didnt think it would take this much writing to point out the things I thought were off. If its any consolation the multiplayer scenario is Tight =P\n\nThanks a lot for the work you put in! Ill probably print these off some time soon xD"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=458675","commentId":458675,"userName":"NinjaDorg","timestamp":1303716124,"content":"Thanks for your feedback mate!  To address your concerns:\n\nIt's clearly a fanmade adventure so I have no problem with people \"spotting\" that, as it were, with the wording for removing Legolas.  It's kind of a cool mechanic too when he comes in to save the day.\n\nEvery other turn means every second turn, so your assumption is correct.  Not sure how else you could interpret it?  The staging wording is taken from the Anduin scenario and is intended the same way.\n\nAnd you're correct, in the last stage, the orc is not random (like the Spiders adventure), so you can pick a nice easy one to kill.  You'll still have whatever else is in the staging area though, so it's just an extra little challenge, hence the difficulty level = 3.  Your resources should be pretty sparse by this point though with just one hero (or two heroes with Legolas).  If you feel up to taking on Chieftain Ufthak at this point by all means tweak the adventure how you like!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=458679","commentId":458679,"userName":"DerBarchen","timestamp":1303716695,"content":"Cools! To be honest I just nit-pick a lot.

The fact that the game is dictated by the scenario rather than your opponent's deck as in other games means that community made quests etc. could very well play a Huge part. You could be a pioneer of sorts =p\n\nI hope FFG is paying atention, I think this might be the first card game with community made \"mods\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45737-2-new-scenarios/?do=findComment&comment=458680","commentId":458680,"userName":"DerBarchen","timestamp":1303716839,"content":"Oh also, forgot to say, I love the exposition.
