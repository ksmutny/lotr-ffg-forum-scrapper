I've been thinking about this for a long time, but the thought \"bubbled back up\" the other day while listening to the COTR podcast guys speculate about the potential need to errata \"Blood of Gondor\" and \"Gondorian Fire\". It amazed me that nobody seemed to recognize that the root of the problem underneath these two, and many other resource generated effect cards... is SOG. I've also noted that a lot of the more well known community deck builders, like Seastan and Ataruslash, seem to be hooked on it like it's cocaine, and  barely have the ability to make a deck without it. This isn't a slam on them, but rather a slam on a card design that makes 1 card so central to virtually every power deck ever built.\n\nFrom the very beginning I've struggled with this card. It's offensive to one's sense of theme to constantly have to justify how Amarthiul, or Celeborn is suddenly the Steward of Gondor. It only took me a few plays before I became bored with including it in every deck, as it's so up-front overpowered and has no subtlety to it at all. It almost takes an entire consideration element, resource generation/management, out of the game once it hits the table. \n\n I feel that I have been forced to play it as the lynchpin behind so many decks all of these years, that I almost can't stand to play it anymore... and yet I still feel pressured to because all of the newest scenarios released seem to assume a SOG driven resource power curve. It's part of the reason why they have struggled to bring the \"Gondor\" themed trait to maturity... because the biggest distinct perk that the Gondor archetype has (resource generation and hero defense) is applicable to everybody thanks to one OP card (along with a free Gondor trait to boot!). It is so blatantly powerful, that it changes the game, sort of similar to how a black hole warps gravity within it's vicinity... to where it in and of itself is an integral mechanic of the game an not just a card.\n\nThe sad thing is, it would be the world's easiest card to errata and fix ALL of these problems. One simply has to replace \"gains Gondor trait\" with \"play on a hero with the Gondor trait\". Boom. It fixes the thematic problem, it somewhat mitigates the power problem (now you atleast have to play \"In service of the Steward\" before abusing it in every power deck you make), AND it actually gives the Gondor archetype something to build around as a distinct contribution to deck building. Suddenly not just every deck can make use of nearly infinite resources and \"Gondorian Shields\". These actually become special things that require the Gondor archetype as atleast a sub-theme.\n\nIt's incredible how they won't touch the obvious offender, and yet they'll completely nerf an otherwise interesting card like \"Master of Lore\" in an attempt to stop one obscure combo that only people interested in exploiting and breaking the game are going to play anyway... and not even the most offensive card in this combo!\n\nCurious to the thoughts of other long time players? I really think deck building would be far more interesting and balanced if SOG were errata'd.\n\nEdited September 5, 2016 by Gunslinger83"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2400798","commentId":2400798,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1473116365,"content":"This topic seems to come up a lot.

So is A Test of Will for its effect.\n\nI find it pretty strong to claim that modern quests demand Steward's use -- the only quests from the last couple of cycles I have felt compelled to use it for were Helm's Deep, Carn Dum, and Ruins of Belegost. I don't find it amiss that the hardest of the hard push you towards power cards; for the same reason, those were also the quests where I used A Burning Brand, which I frankly find more problematic than Steward (but still wouldn't care to errata).\n\n(Steward IS in a couple of my more recent published decklists, but when you're talking about recurring Infighting or two-hero Secrecy, you deserve a couple of power cards...)\n\nI bet Nate French could've saved himself a lot of emails if he'd just named it \"Support of Gondor\", though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2400800","commentId":2400800,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1473116397,"content":"Can I give multiple likes to a post?

Any significant errata on it at this point in the game would have some pretty serious ramifications. As a mostly solo player (and not a particularly good one), I certainly do lean on that crutch and would be somewhat disappointed to see it go away.

But I strongly disagree it needs errata. Let's look at the pros and cons:\n\n \n\nPro:\n\n-increases a player's ressources per turn by 67% (5 instead of 3)\n\n-grants the Gondor trait (what enables specific attachments and other buffs)\n\n-low cost\n\n-instantly repays itself (you don't loose \"tempo\" for playing SoG as you get your invested back instantly)\n\n-universally useful (the ressources can be used for anything, unlike something like \"O Lorien\")\n\n-Attachment (unaffacted by charcater targetting effects)\n\n \n\nCons:\n\n-Leadership only (so you have to \"find\" a way to pay for it without a Fitting hero)\n\n-Attachment (affected by attachment targetting effects)\n\n-unique (only one can be in Play at a given time)\n\n \n\nWhat instatly comes to mind is, that there are more pros, than cons, so it looks like SoG is at least decent. As being an attachment usually is more \"safe\" than being an ally this is more of a pro than a con. Needing access to Leadership is also fairly easy these days (a good harvest is probably the best example), so that's only a small downside. Getting two extra ressources per turn is great and don't having to wait for them even better.\n\nSo why don't errata it? Because it is unique.\n\nThe more Players there are the weaker SoG gets. Assuming the Players have Access to ressource trading adding two extra to a pool of 9 is much worse than to 3.\n\nIn my oppinion the idea of SoG being to good comes mainly from Solo Play. You might argue that in multiplayer games everyone tries to get down Steward first, but I would say that it's still preferable to have SoG out than not to, but that goes for any Card that is deemed \"good\". If you face much (direct) damage, you want your wardens of ealing out asap.\n\nThe nice Thing about solo Play is the ability to Play every Card you want without looking at other Players. Wanna go Gandalf? Sure. Light of Valinor? Noone else will take that. Unique Cards always look better solo than multiplayer, because they are only balanced, because they are unique, what has the least Impact in solo Play.\n\n \n\nI am not sure, if looking at the amounts of decks in ringsdb that use SoG says much more about the Card, than that is good and useful. I always have the Impression (could be wrong though) most of the posted decks are self-sustained (aka playable solo) as it is much easier to uplot These decks than Fellowships of 2 or more decks that are supposed to work together. \n\nThe fact that there are a good amount of decks that have no Leadership heroes and run a good harvest to get it in Play doesn't allow for errata either. When printing a Card like AgH you WANT People to Play one or two off colour Cards. Songs etc. are much better for smoothing than a good harvest. that it results mostly in Steward being picked is it's universally functionality. And that is one of the few Cards that work super good with any sphere, you wouldn't Play many other Cards off sphere. Feint is an awesome Card, but why run it in my mono Spirit deck, that either can't fight at all (and therefore can't benefit from that one round) or already handles combat nicely with Spirit Options. Trying to say: Only effects that are always good will ever be splashed and we have very few of them (and you can't use AgH before a Response like a test of will, otherwise this would be done, too).\n\n \n\nTo summarize: SoG just Looks to good especially in solo Play, but that goes for all strong unique Cards. SoG in General is from the root of it's design a Card that it's better to have than not and we have so few of These that an easily splashable attachment (FFG pretty much invited People with the release of AgH) gets more Attention than it Needs.\n\nIf you don't like \"always good\" Cards the only solution is to cut SoG from your Collection, but you better don't run a test of will either."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2401962","commentId":2401962,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1473179105,"content":"I find suggesting errata for a card simply because you don't like how often it is used is a terrible terrible reason to do so.

Hats off to you sir, not only did you think of this before me.... you went as far to print off cards!!! I'd almost pay you to personally mail one of these to each of the game's designers, and maybe 3 for myself.\n\nWow, really impressed by the quality of discussion....exceeded my expectations for this thread. Love this community.\n\nAnyway, so I do concede a few things that I hadn't thought of when writing this. SOG is indeed a problem that scales down with number of players. I've been playing this game 5 years and have only played real live multiplayer maybe 5 or 6 times, the rest has been solo (occasionally) or double fisting (mostly)... so that does tend to color my perspective. It makes sense that more players in the game tends to tone down things like unique power cards and surge, and drive up the problem of location lock, etc.... so the game does definitely change with number of players.\n\nAs far as the argument that making an errata now would nerf 75% of the power decks, I have two things to say about that:\n\n1. Good. It will force creativity. Now when the deck building gurus sit down and open their binders, they'll actually have to consider resource acceleration as something they have to creatively implement in their design, instead of a run of the mill 3x \"A Good Harvest\", 3x \"SOG\", done... on to next element. One of my biggest problems with SOG is not only it's power, but that it's so damned boring. It's like playing Tactics Boromir every time. In fact, what finally solidified my opinion on this card was when I realized that the only way I was able to beat \"Deadman's Dike\" was turning Elrohir into Tactics Boromir...literally. If the card were atleast the slightest bit interesting, I could forgive it's power. I mean don't people get bored out of their minds playing this card deck after deck after deck?\n\n2. Actually, the errata I propose doesn't even really nerf it's power... it just confines it to an archetype. If you want the tremendous resource acceleration of SOG, gotta find some way to incorporate Gondor into your deck. This is almost too easy with the new Leadership Denethor.... as he's set up to do exactly that. And that brings me to my next point.....\n\nThe thing that offends me the most about this card is what it does to the \"Gondor\" trait archetype. I really believe it's the reason that the designers have not been able to give us a compelling reason to build Gondor decks in 4 deluxe boxes, 4 chapter back cycles, and 4 saga releases of player cards.\n\nIt's clear to me that Gondor was supposed to be the resource generating/ultra defense archetype.... sort of how the Dunedain are the enemy engagement bonus archetype, the Silvans are the \"in and out\" archetype, etc. However, the most powerful resource generating tool that Gondor has, is available to everybody! Not only that, but the damned thing actually GIVES the Gondor trait... meaning whoever SOG gets played on can take advantage of all the Gondor defense/resource synergy.\n\nWhy would you ever build a Gondor deck when the best that the Gondor archetype has can easily be incorporated into any archetype with 3 cards (6 if no leadership heroes)? That in my mind is the biggest problem.... and the reason I suggest the errata that I do.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2402020","commentId":2402020,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1473180379,"content":"Not sure if adding \"Attach to Gondor Hero\" really reduces the power very much.

Steward of Gondor can enhance all these decks if included, but it's definitely not a make or break kind of thing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2402101","commentId":2402101,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1473182482,"content":">  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  Seastan...  barely have the ability to make a deck without it. \n\n \n\nWell, that hurts.

Theme-loving players, such as myself, have had a problem with this card since the core set. Eventually my own mind errata-ed the cardname to 'Support of the Gondor' and that's the end of that. It's the only suggestion I got I'm afraid.\n\n \n\n \n\nAs for the power of the card...\n\n \n\nFirst off, errata on this card would be fairly useless. After all, errata is usually given to prevent certain game-states from occuring. And while SoG is the easiest resource acceleration card in the game, it is not the only one.\n\n \n\nIn the Galdor/Cirdan deck I've been using lately, getting the Zigil Miner/ Stargazer combo up is so easy due to how fast I'm going through my deck, that it's essentially just another SoG (3 Zigies, 2 stargazers and Narya works unsuprisingly well :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]). Gloin has reached his real potential and getting 60+ resources on him without SoG is business as usual. And resource-happy heroes such as Arwen and Denethor have arrived. In other words: without SoG in the game, we can still create tons of resources. Alternatively, Caldara and other 'put into play' effects have also been trending lately (. \n\n \n\nSo at this point, all SoG does, is allow less dedicated Uber decks to catch up with the power decks that are already available. So I would argue the opposite: in today's metagame, SoG actually balances the game more!\n\n \n\n \n\nAs for holding back the Gondor trait...\n\n \n\nI wouldn't draw any links between it's succes and Gondor's waning. Sure, Gondor would be more popular if the card only went on them, but honestly, Gondor right now is just an 'adjusted for balance' version of the dwarves. It's underdeveloped as a trait and it's 'powers up through resources' mechanic is barely developed.\n\n \n\n \n\nBack to the power thing...\n\n \n\nSo you've noticed that most power decks include SoG and concluded that it is used in all decks and that the current quests require resource generation which removes the aspect of resource gathering. First of all, if it truely removed the resource gathering part, people would simply play more expensive cards. Gandalfs for everyone. That doesn't happen, so it's not that powerful. Second, and this is the most important thing, using SoG requires you to DRAW it and PLAY it before you can reap it's power. And if your deck can only win if you have it in your opening hand, you'll not be winning much games. Every powerdeck needs to be able to survive without a SoG in case you don't draw it. This is why I prefer to deckbuild without SoG initially, then include it once I'm certain my deck holds up well enough if I don't draw it. And while Seastan may snort SoG like crack cocaine from a Good Harvest, all his decks that run SoG are capable of standing their own before he draws into it. And lately the quests have gotten better in punishing turtle-style decks by requiring players to go 100% from turn 1. SoG takes time to really influence the game.\n\n \n\nWhich leads to the final fair point you make: quests expect you to run SoG. This seems to be true for solo. Quests have grown with the power curve of the game. Combat power (T), Willpower (S), card draw (L) and resource acceleration (L) have all become nessecities to win against the harder quests solo. That means each sphere have lost to spherebleeding some aspect that it used to dominate. I used to hate that, but having played through the last cycle multiple times, I have to admit that it is required in order to keep up. And that's not nessecarily a bad thing. Turtleing ( slowly building up an army, then stomping through the quest) was the norm in the early days, now the encounter deck also builds up. Playing SoG doesn't mean you'll auto-win the late game anymore. And that too, is a good thing. But it's only possible if the encounter deck is STRONGER than a random SoG deck.\n\n \n\n \n\nSo yeah, I get what you're saying. But I think SoG is too easily replacable by other cards to change the meta-game by removing it, helps 'weaker' decks compete with others, is not as powerful as you think it is due to the low chance of drawing it and decks need to be build to surivive without it. I also approve of encounter decks being powerful late game so it deals with the turtle strategy without finicky time-counters (how I hate those things!)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2402284","commentId":2402284,"userName":"Zura","timestamp":1473187124,"content":"Once upon a time, there was a really broken card in this game.

I'd almost pay you to personally mail one of these to each of the game's designers, and maybe 3 for myself.\n\nWell thank you! I wouldn't want to sell them to anyone, though--I printed them for myself!\n\n \n\nFor what it's worth, the reason I was motivated to house rule this card was to give Gondor more of an identity. I feel like we've recently hit a critical mass of alternative resource acceleration cards such that Steward of Gondor is no longer required in most decks, even for high-level solo play. Limiting the card to Gondor heroes tightens up the Gondor synergy and carves out a niche for all of the different resource acceleration cards in different decks.\n\n \n\nI don't know that I would go so far as to call for an official errata, though. Steward of Gondor has been a core mechanic for the game for so long that I'm not sure I can fully fathom how it would change the early game without the full modern cardpool. I'd prefer if the card were designed this way at the start, but at this point I think it might be too late to fix in an official capacity."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2402486","commentId":2402486,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1473193850,"content":">  \n> \n> 2. Actually, the errata I propose doesn't even really nerf it's power... it just confines it to an archetype. If you want the tremendous resource acceleration of SOG, gotta find some way to incorporate Gondor into your deck. This is almost too easy with the new Leadership Denethor.... as he's set up to do exactly that. And that brings me to my next point.....\n> \n> The thing that offends me the most about this card is what it does to the \"Gondor\" trait archetype. I really believe it's the reason that the designers have not been able to give us a compelling reason to build Gondor decks in 4 deluxe boxes, 4 chapter back cycles, and 4 saga releases of player cards.\n> \n> It's clear to me that Gondor was supposed to be the resource generating/ultra defense archetype.... sort of how the Dunedain are the enemy engagement bonus archetype, the Silvans are the \"in and out\" archetype, etc. However, the most powerful resource generating tool that Gondor has, is available to everybody! Not only that, but the damned thing actually GIVES the Gondor trait... meaning whoever SOG gets played on can take advantage of all the Gondor defense/resource synergy.\n> \n> Why would you ever build a Gondor deck when the best that the Gondor archetype has can easily be incorporated into any archetype with 3 cards (6 if no leadership heroes)? That in my mind is the biggest problem.... and the reason I suggest the errata that I do.\n\nI think you're right about connecting resources to the Gondor archetype -- LeBoromir and Visionary Leadership, the key cards for a Gondor deck, require an unspent resource.  You also see the unspent resource connection with Blood of Numenor and Gondorian Fire.  Add to that the heavy leadership tilt to Gondor allies, and it's clear that Gondor wants lots of resources -- Steward of Gondor is arguably more important to Gondor decks than any other type, and has the fringe benefit of making its recipient eligible for generic Gondorian buffs.\n\n \n\nBut slapping Steward/Blood/Fire on a single overpowered hero doesn't make it a \"Gondor deck\", even if the hero you are slapping it on is the very Gondorian TaBoromir.  If you're not playing Visionary Leadership, it's not a Gondor deck.  Why would you build a Gondor deck when Steward/Blood/Fire/Shield find themselves in all sorts of power decks?  How about because you want to play a *Gondor deck*, and a power deck without Visionary Leadership and a host of Gondorian allies isn't a Gondor deck?  Because you don't compete with other players, there's no requirement to play the most powerful deck possible, and even if a super TaBoromir deck is provably more efficient than a LeBoromir Gondor deck, the Gondor deck will present a different experience and is therefore worth playing.  All the designers need to do is make sure that Gondor as a trait is *viable*, which I think they've done.  We're actually getting cards and heroes that work well in a Gondor deck in this cycle, IMO.\n\n \n\nWould having SoG require Gondor trait make Gondor decks more popular?  I doubt it.  To be sure, it'd increase the popularity of Gondor *heroes*, but putting Gondor heroes in other archtypes to get Steward of Gondor access doesn't strike me as a vast improvement.  (It would discourage non-Gondor heroes in actual Gondor decks, since you can't get Visionary Leadership buff and/or LeDenthor transfer to them as easily.)  Power decks wanting Steward of Gondor would find heroes like TaBoromir and LeDenethor even more attractive -- will this really encourage greater diversity of decks?\n\n \n\nIt would also make the core leadership cards for new players substantial less powerful, and I think that's a bad thing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2402515","commentId":2402515,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1473194500,"content":"Clearly the only solution is to errata Tactics Boromir to remove his Gondor trait.\n\n;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2402561","commentId":2402561,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1473195986,"content":"The Gondor allies are a conflicted bunch in my head anyways.

For instance, they could print a Lore Steward of Gondor that attaches to a Gondor hero and exhausts itself and/or the hero to either use Henamarth's or Lore Denethor's ability. A spirit version might exhaust to ready another attachment, replicating the ability of Unexpected Courage for attachments.\n\nI shudder to think of the power of a card by the title Steward of Gondor that would displace the Core Set version."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2404308","commentId":2404308,"userName":"Aorakis","timestamp":1473281941,"content":"I.M.O steward is not even the problem.

It's a bit like nerfing Black Lotus in Magic after all those years... Pointless really.\n\nThey already nerfed a ressource generator, (and badly (i.m.o), wich was the horn of gondor :  yeah i said baldy nerfed coz' they could have wrote \"limit 2x per turn\" or \"1x per phase\" or something the like.\n\nAnd they did that for... 1 single deck abusing it... !

I would also say that this kind of \"O.P\" card is needed in a card game. Every card game got those cards.\n\nAnd to be honest, without it, a lot of decks would not work at all. And reducing that ratio. would defenatly hurt the game and community in a real bad way.\n\nSo yeah, a lot of people plays it, and a lot of people don't ! (in a 4p game, just one steward is on table.. And well.. Other players are not complaining...)\n\nTo me steward is more a solo (needed) card ! That help against those big hard quests.\n\nCoz some quest are that hard, that you need the best to succed them. And not only steward.. We could also speak about Test of Will and the almost obligation to play Spirit in solo ! (to me, this is a much biggest problem than that steward...)\n\nAbout Thematic... You said \"the worst thematic\" ? really ? I can gave you some other \"unthematic\" or stuff that makes me laughed a lot in this game instead of this one :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nHow about Tree beard that put some burning brand to his own \"bones\" ? ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\nOr do you know that joke starting like :  Once upon a time, there's was an Ent on a boat...\n\nHow about having two mounts... ? i mean... you put the 1st mount on the horse, then you climb them both ? To me it's a bit like a guy driving 2 car at the same time... Some sort...\n\nIf Steward of gondor hurt your Thematic love, i suggest you to never watch those Bilbo the Hobbits movie ! ^^ (they're bad actually so i'm really suggesting you to never watch those ^^) (ok landscapes are nice, of course they are ! New Zealand is wonderful !)\n\nWell, i will stop here for those exemple but i got many more.\n\nTo me steward has to stay as it is.\n\nNot like we had'nt some other ressources generators or mechanic that just does'nt need that steward to work propely !\n\nInstead of all that, i would strongly recommand to ffg to rework some lower cards nor heroes !

When Aragorn arrives in Minas Tirith he gets the resources of gondor and becomes \"one of them\".\n\nThis is precisely why we have \"In Service of the Steward\". In fact, this card is a living illustration of what this game is missing as far as a defined \"Gondor\" trait. This would normally be a heavy sought after card if it was actually required to give heroes a Gondor synergy as well as play SOG. No other trait splasher (Elf-Friend, Nor am I a Stranger, etc.) is 0 cost while having an ability that represents the best of it's trait synergy. \n\nHonestly, this thread has influenced my view on SOG. I get the arguments of how it might be necessary in solo play against the hardest scenarios, how it's less effective with more players, that there are more good resource generating options every cycle to atleast decrease the absolute dependence on it, and how a card like this might be necessary in a Core box deck for new players. I still think that they could have toned down it's OP'ness a \"little\" bit.... a good suggestion being coming into play exhausted....but I get the \"pro\" arguments.\n\nI've come to realize that I could probably live with it's power as long as nobody who uses it ever complains about the game being too easy. (seriously, every time somebody complains about the game being too easy, I go and look at their decks and see SOG with all the same power cards! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png])\n\nI think now the part that really offends me the most is the \"attached character gains Gondor trait\" part. Even just deleting this line from the card altogether would be a vast improvement....as it would still give away Gondor's best resource generator to all archetypes but it wouldn't give away the Gondor synergy for free (i.e. Gondorian Shield, Wealth of Gondor, etc). Dain in a dwarf deck or Elrohir in a ninja deck would cease being the epitome of the Gondor archetype.\n\nI mean, what was the thought process behind it? \n\n\"Man, this card is not game breaking OP'ed enough, lets allow it to give away the Gondor synergy for free to give it a boost\"? Honestly, as experimental as this game design was, they probably had no clue what it was going to look like in reaching maturity, and should probably be forgiven this. That's sort of how \"first of their type\" designs work.... lot's of inevitable design mistakes and learning points.\n\nActually, I have a theory that the designers secretly agree with most of what I've been saying. I think that somewhere around the HoN deluxe, when Caleb and Matt were taking over and trying to develop a Gondor synergy, somebody took a second look at the core cards and thought \"oh.......crap\". I think they realized how the design of SOG cramped their Gondor (and resource generation) design space, but decided to roll with it anyway since it was already so integral to the game at that point... and they have been fighting it ever since. \n\nIn COTR's 100th episode, the designers were asked if there were any cards they regretted, and it was pretty obvious from the answer that there was. Of course, they didn't talk about it as is only professional, but what they \"didn't\" say really said it all.\n\nI have no doubt what card is at the top of their list, and I have full confidence that when the LOTR LCG 2.0 reboot hits, any SOG equivalent will be a lot more toned down and balanced from the outset. However, if my theory is correct, that also means that it is highly unlikely that they will ever errata it at this point in the game.... even if they secretly agree with me. They will continue to try to boost the Gondor trait, continue to find other creative means of resource generation to help \"soften the blow\" of SOG on the meta.\n\n \n\nTo me, it's very obvious that Leadership Denethor was designed \"specifically\" to be the target of SOG... and thus tie it back in to Gondor decks in the meta. By releasing an extremely powerful Gondor hero that is the perfect target for SOG, they practically ensure that people show up to groups with Denethor decks that tie up SOG. It's actually probably the most brilliant move that they could have made to correct the meta without outright errata."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2415119","commentId":2415119,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1473926196,"content":"I have never had an issue eith this card.

I suspect SoG is next on the chopping block.\n\nMany, many decks are reliant on a particular card -- usually heroes, but not always.  Nor does a deck becoming unviable after errata show that \"the card was too powerful to begin with\" -- that was certainly not the case with Master of Lore.  Errata has costs, and affecting the power level of every deck that currently uses a card is certainly a cost to be considered.\n\n \n\nLet's consider the relevant definition of a crutch -- \"a thing used for support or reassurance\".  In which of these decks do you suppose the current \"Steward of Gondor\" is a crutch?\n\n \n\n1) In a super-Boromir deck where it's used to drive Gondorian Fire and Blood of Numenor?\n\n2) In a Sam-Pippin-Merry leadership deck where it is nice to have, but Resourceful is the card mulliganed for?\n\n3) In a beginner's core set deck where it is used to play those hideously overpriced and weak core allies?\n\n \n\nIs it a crutch for super-Boromir?  It's critical to generate insane offense/defense, but the deck is perfectly viable without it.  Threat is Boromir's currency, and Elrohir probably needs SoG more than Boromir does.\n\n \n\nIs it a crutch for the standard Hobbit deck?  Not at all -- it comes in handy because it's a powerful card, but it isn't essential to the design.\n\n \n\nIs it a crutch for the beginner's deck?  Absolutely, and it's worth mulliganing for.  Even *with* Steward of Gondor, the deck's power is marginal, without it Leadership has only Sneak Gandalf to bolster it compared to other spheres.\n\n \n\nTo my mind, this doesn't prove that SoG is \"too powerful\" and needs errata -- it shows that the core set *needs* powerful, general-purpose cards so that beginners can construct a *viable* deck.  It's no accident, I think, that nearly all the staple cards (useful to every deck of a sphere) are found in the core -- new players *need* crutches, and need them badly.  Advocating breaking those crutches because you are bored with them and no longer need them strikes me as exactly the wrong approach, especially in the cause of a non-existent need for \"game balance\".\n\n \n\nWith that said, I confess that a modified SoG that rewards Gondor instead of granting it is a more *interesting* card than the current model.  If the core set were redesigned from scratch, the revised Steward of Gondor would be fine as long as they also improved all the cruddy leadership cards that are coasters in the full card pool at the same time.  \n\n \n\nAt least the revised Steward of Gondor is still a useful card, unlike the errata-ed Horn of Gondor.  The new version may be \"more thematic\", but there's no shortage of thematic coasters.  The fate of Horn of Gondor and Master of Lore -- both \"fixed\" to resolve a \"problem\" generated chiefly by *other* cards -- is a graphic reminder that errata is not be lightly wished on any card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229390-the-one-card-that-needs-errata-to-balance-this-gamethoughts/?do=findComment&comment=2456760","commentId":2456760,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1476452778,"content":"> Agreed, the fact that SOG becomes necessary for a variety of decks to be viable means that a variety of decks aren't using more interesting and niche forms of resource acceleration.

The Tactics player is usually expected to engage enemies and defend their attacks in order to defeat them, but this often means that their allies are destroyed by those enemy attacks. Therefore, it is important to the Tactics player to have a way of gaining resources in order to play more allies to replace those losses. Horn of Gondor provides those resources by giving the attached hero a resource whenever a character leaves play. However, because its Response triggers “After a character leaves play…” instead of “After a character is destroyed…” it left its ability open to all types of abuses. The design team has corrected this by changing Horn of Gondor to read:“Response: After a character is destroyed, add 1 resource to attached hero’s pool.” We believe this errata balances the Horn of Gondor in the game while preserving its original intended use.\n\n \n\nBut back in 2013, a second breakfast by Caleb Grace appears here:\n\n \n\nhttps://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/ [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2013/3/19/second-breakfast/]\n\n \n\nIt's a spirit/tactics deck with 2x Horn of Gondor, and he recommends Horn of Gondor as one of five cards he uses for his mulligan decision, since it's his only source of resources.  Is that because of it's \"original intended use?\"\n\n \n\nPotential chump blockers:\n\n2x Gondorian Spearman\n\n3x Envoy of Pelargir\n\n \n\nAnti-chump defense:\n\n2x Arwen Undomiel\n\n3x Defender of Rammas\n\n3x Great Yew Bow\n\n3x Hands Upon the Bow\n\n3x Feint\n\n3x Light in the Dark\n\n \n\nLeaves play:\n\n3x Gandalf\n\n3x Escort from Edoras\n\n \n\nSeems to me the \"intended use\" relies on the original wording in this case, and likely many others."}]}
