And more you progress more dangerous struggle you meet.

If you purchased a Generic ticket for a play session, you did not get the Osgiliath Encounter Pile.  It cost $2.00 to participate in any play session.  But, you needed a pre-paid session ticket for  a specific session to get the Osgiliath Encounter Pile freebie.  I don't know about Thursday, but Friday and Saturday when I tried to sign-up, I could only get Generic tickets.\n\n \n\n."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52723-so-are-there-osgiliath-cards-i-dont-know-about/?do=findComment&comment=526230","commentId":526230,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1315591913,"content":"Svenn said:\n\nMan, I want this!
