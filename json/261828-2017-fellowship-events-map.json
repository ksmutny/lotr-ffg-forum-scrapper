It's a great opportunity to meet other players and play an epic game of LotR.\n\nI've compiled a map of known 2017 Fellowship Events as well as a list of places that have held Fellowship Event in previous years that might be worth checking out. If you know of a location that is hosting an event and is not on the map, feel free to add it yourself! It is helpful if you can add the appropriate date, time, and a link to a page with more information, if possible.\n\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=1qyvWDJU7hQlwgAFr_S8nBqE6HDU&usp=sharing [https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qyvWDJU7hQlwgAFr_S8nBqE6HDU&usp=sharing]\n\nEdited October 26, 2017 by Seastan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261828-2017-fellowship-events-map/?do=findComment&comment=3049425","commentId":3049425,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1509051212,"content":"I add 4 events, all in France.

Luckily, we have a quite proactive community of players who organizes a meeting once a year to play our lovely game with the help of a local store that ask for the kits in english so we can play them. This year we had 30 people playing LOTR LCG.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/261828-2017-fellowship-events-map/?do=findComment&comment=3055154","commentId":3055154,"userName":"GravyK","timestamp":1509387947,"content":"I would love to participate in one if anyone knows of one going on in Michigan.
