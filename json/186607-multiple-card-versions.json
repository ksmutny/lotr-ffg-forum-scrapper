That is, can I build a deck with 3 Gandalf (Ally) AND a Gandalf Hero? (I am aware of the fact that I only will be able to play the ally version if the hero die)\n\nThanks in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/186607-multiple-card-versions/?do=findComment&comment=1765370","commentId":1765370,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1441031374,"content":"You can, but unless your Gandalf hero dies you won't be able to put your Gandalf allies into play since they're unique."}]}
