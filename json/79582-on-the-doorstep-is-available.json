This is pretty tough in two player.\n\nWhile the quest is challenging, I'm sure that I could tailor decks that could handle it pretty well. Using ways to kill the spiders in the staging area for instance would make it a lot easier.\n\n\n\nThanks for info."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79582-on-the-doorstep-is-available/?do=findComment&comment=769447","commentId":769447,"userName":"Ted Sandyman","timestamp":1362283199,"content":"Attention all uk players, Gamesquest now have it in stock.

In my opinion is not right when some combinaion of cards is too powerful in the game. Is meat bad job of designers.\n\nIs unfair for tournaments system\n\nAnd is unfair to Tolkien world. I like to fear the encounter cards not laugh about them. I can win in 5 rounds again Balrog. I dont scare him and feel boring.\n\nIn Middle-earh ccg or Lotr Tcg all Mordor cards was scary. You really have a problem and scre them. Is good fit Tolkien them. here is just a matter who make it more quicly. Is only 1 powerful enemy in the gmae now is Smaug. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79582-on-the-doorstep-is-available/?do=findComment&comment=771077","commentId":771077,"userName":"Ted Sandyman","timestamp":1362649825,"content":"I hope that FFG do care about our opinions regarding the over powerful dwarf deck.
