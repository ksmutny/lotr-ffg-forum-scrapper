Trying to keep this as short as possible.\n\nThe Quest Log is a really good thing. It's exactly what a game like LotR LCG needs. It can potentially extend the gaming experience from pure intrinsic fun to a challenging competition, adding a factor of consistency and longlivity which makes other games of same and different kind alike successfull. However, in its current form it can't really live up to its potential.\n\nWhen I log into my Quest Log (no pun intended) I can see the results of all my games and a ton of statistics, which is awesome. However, I cannot see how others are performing, what a top score on a specific quest is, what kind of weird hero combinations people are using etc. In order to do that I would have to make \"friends\" with people on the forum which is a huge limitation. Usually the vast majority of forum users are lurkers. They read the forums as often and play as often, they simply refuse to make an account and / or contribute to threads, since its (usually) a big waste of time. This is my pledge to a more open and accessible kind of quest log. I would greatly appreciate a comment from FFQ on the regard.\n\nNow onto the actual subject:\n\nTo make the Quest Log in its current form worthwhile and work in the way that it's supposed to you'd need a friends list full of Quest Log users. This thread is supposed to accomplish this in the best way as it's currently possible.\n\nI'm making a start here:\n\nEveryone who wants to participate in the Quest Log, feel free to add me as friend. (In the request, leave a comment that says \"quest log\")\n\nEveryone who wants to enrichen the Quest Log experience just like that is welcome to leave a similar message on this thread. \n\n \n\nNote of FFG: If a sufficent number of players actually use this kind of \"service\" it would be a good idea to sticky it so that every new player who comes across this board can access the player list right away. Feel free to edit as pleased and / or even merge it with the current quest log thread, adjusting the title or so.\n\n \n\nRegards,\n\n \n\nChris"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=556874","commentId":556874,"userName":"OnkelZorni","timestamp":1321506016,"content":"I agree to your statements and sent you a friendship request\n\n \n\nAnyone may feel free to add me as friend"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=556886","commentId":556886,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1321509545,"content":"OnkelZorni said:\n\nI agree to your statements and sent you a friendship request\n\n \n\nAnyone may feel free to add me as friend\n\n\n\nThe exact same =)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=556888","commentId":556888,"userName":"plueschi2","timestamp":1321509953,"content":" Same here, just add me"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=556929","commentId":556929,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1321521912,"content":"I'm game.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=557105","commentId":557105,"userName":"Eric W","timestamp":1321546723,"content":"add me too\n\n..............."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=557232","commentId":557232,"userName":"ShadowGhost2","timestamp":1321574982,"content":"I would like to join too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=557235","commentId":557235,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1321576535,"content":"Please add me, with a message of Lord of the Ring, or something similar"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=557315","commentId":557315,"userName":"Eric W","timestamp":1321600579,"content":"Can I compare quests verse all friends at once, or only 1 friend at a time?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=557323","commentId":557323,"userName":"Bungo_Underhill","timestamp":1321602246,"content":"I think opening it up more for everyone would be a great idea!\n\nHappy to add and be added to :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=557324","commentId":557324,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1321602536,"content":"Everyone can add me!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=557326","commentId":557326,"userName":"UnthoughtKnown","timestamp":1321603279,"content":"Eric W said:\n\nCan I compare quests verse all friends at once, or only 1 friend at a time?\n\n\n\n \n\nI think its just 1 at a time"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56381-the-quest-log-participation-thread-sticky/?do=findComment&comment=557327","commentId":557327,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1321603305,"content":" I have a lot more plays with the old scoring system than with the current one (darn retail hours in November!).
