Does this mean that you get to look through the top 5 cards of your deck and if there are any attachments, you can add 1 to your hand? Or does it mean that you can search for 1 specific attachment (Forest Snare, Burning Brand, etc.) if it is in the top 5 cards you can add it to your hand?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297060-master-of-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=3733396","commentId":3733396,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1562124818,"content":"I see what you're saying, but here's RR Search [http://www.lotr-lcg-quest-companion.gamersdungeon.net/#Rule590]:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> When a player is instructed to search for a card, the player is permitted to look at each of the cards in the searched area.\n> \n> If the player finds a card that meets the eligibility requirements being searched for, the player may add that card to the game area indicated by the instructions on the search effect.\n\nSo, you look at each of your top 5 cards. The \"eligibility requirement\" is \"any 1 attachment\". So you add any 1 attachment you find to your hand—you do not have to name it in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297060-master-of-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=3746311","commentId":3746311,"userName":"PigsAreOurEquals","timestamp":1563958153,"content":"It is a bonkers good card!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/297060-master-of-the-forge/?do=findComment&comment=3746421","commentId":3746421,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1563973861,"content":"Especially in decks that are heavy on the attachments, like Trap decks.
