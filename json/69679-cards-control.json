It means also for an attachment card that is in the hand of the player or it is valid only for an attchment card that is on the play field? I ask this because the page nr. 25 of the english rules book says: \"A player controls all cards that he owns\". Please, can someone help me? Thanks in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69679-cards-control/?do=findComment&comment=680064","commentId":680064,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1345685292,"content":"No, effects don't interact with cards out of play (deck, discard or hand) unless they specifically state so (Fortune or Fate), so the attachement has to be in play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69679-cards-control/?do=findComment&comment=680142","commentId":680142,"userName":"Fabio70","timestamp":1345698656,"content":"Grazie!
