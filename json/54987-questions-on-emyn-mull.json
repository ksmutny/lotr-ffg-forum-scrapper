Imho, Surge would have to be defined differently to allow for it to 'stack'. It would have to be defined like the 'Doomed' keyword, i.e. 'Surge X', X being the number of additional cards to be revealed."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54987-questions-on-emyn-mull/?do=findComment&comment=544635","commentId":544635,"userName":"GhostWolf69","timestamp":1319081756,"content":"jhaelen said:\n\nI don't think it's a weak argument.

BUt honestly... I think FFG wants us to execute Surge twice... even if it doesn't have support anywhere in the rules (neither is it denied anywhere).\n\n/wolf"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54987-questions-on-emyn-mull/?do=findComment&comment=544729","commentId":544729,"userName":"Eryx_UK","timestamp":1319095207,"content":"Think of it this way, would benefit would you get from giving Range twice to a hero?
