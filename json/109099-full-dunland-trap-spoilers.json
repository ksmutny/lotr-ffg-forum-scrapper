Except for Firefoot (recently spoiled at http://couplevscardboard.com [http://couplevscardboard.com]), the already spoiled cards can be found at http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4592. [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4592.]\n\n \n\nCeleborn (spoiled)\n\n \n\nLeadership\n\nNaith Guide (spoiled)\n\n \n\nSwift and Silent - Event, cost 1; Action: Ready a hero you control. Then, if your threat is 20 or less and this is the first time you played a copy of Swift and Silent this round, return this card to your hand instead of discarding it.\n\n \n\nTactics\n\nFirefoot (spoiled)\n\n \n\nClose Call (spoiled)\n\n \n\nSpirit\n\nBlue Mountain Trader - Ally, cost 2, 1w 0a 1d 2hp; Dwarf. Action: Choose another player. That player gains control of Blue Mountain Trader. Then, that player moves 1 resource from the resource pool of a hero he controls to the resource pool of a hero you control, or Blue Mountain Trader is discarded.\n\n \n\nThe Fall of Gil-galad - Attachment, cost 1; Song. Limit 1 per deck. Attach to a hero. Response: When attached hero is destroyed, add The Fall of Gil-galad to the victory display to reduce you threat by X, where X is the attached hero's threat cost. Victory 1.\n\n \n\nLore\n\nIthilien Lookout - Ally, cost 3, 1w 2a 0d 2hp; Gondor. Ranger. Secrecy 2. Response: After Ithilien Lookout enters play, look at the top card of the encounter deck. If it is an enemy, you may discard it.\n\nThe Tree People (spoiled)\n\n \n\nNeutral\n\nThe White Council - Event, cost X; X is the number of players in the game. Action: Starting with the first player, each player chooses 1 different option: ready a hero he controls, add 1 resource to the resource pool of a hero he controls, draw 1 card, or shuffle 1 card from his discard pile into his deck.\n\n \n\nSecrecy makes a comeback, and we have our second player card (not counting Treasures) with Victory points. The Fall of Gil-galad combines nicely with Rivendell Minstrel and with either Landroval or Fortune and Fate. \n\n \n\nIthilien Lookout is very good with the secrecy discount, and acceptable without it. Like Miruvor, Swift and Silent can consistently ready different heroes (while your threat is 20 or less). It doesn't have the flexibility of Miruvor, but it also doesn't block your card draw like reusing Miruvor does. It will combo nicely with Leaf Brooch when The Three Trials comes out.\n\n \n\nIt might be surprising to see more support for dwarves, but Blue Mountain Trader is a nice addition that isn't overpowered. It's reminiscent of Wandering Took and Rider of the Mark. Outside of a dwarf deck it might be useful for moving resources, and it's only the second non-unique Spirit dwarf.\n\n \n\nI'm not sure how good The White Council will be. None of its effects are especially powerful, but it provides versatility and, since it's neutral, it might compensate for a sphere's weaknesses.\n\nEdited June 21, 2014 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128269","commentId":1128269,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1403322914,"content":"Thanks, i agree with your points, i especially like the fall of gil galad and ithilien lookout"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128326","commentId":1128326,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1403330203,"content":"Fail of Gil-Galad looks really strange for me now……..who want to do that???

Near the end if they block an attack that ends up killing them at least you get a threat reduction of 13/12! (Make sure you use loragorns threat reset first!) I usually use them as defenders anyway and in the games I play where they do die I might stand more of a chance to still win with a threat reduction of 12/13 allowing the other deck to deal with most enemies etc.\n\nWhite council whilst still pretty good, is nowhere near as good as I thought it would be. Was really hoping it would do some minor healing or remove a condition attachment. Drawing a card is good but the shuffle a card from your discard pile into deck is useless for my play style.\n\nIthilien lookout seems pretty cool and possibly better than ithilien archer but lacks ranged which is awesome in two player/two handed. Might try him out and see how good his extra effect really is. Secrecy seems wasted on him though.\n\nThanks so much for the spoilers!

By name alone I hope it features some truly epic art. I'm sure some people will try to build around it and make it work but for the most part I can't see it being anything more than a token addition. The fact that it's an attachment and not an event really makes it more difficult to use because now you either need to have a pretty good idea of which of your heroes is most likely to die first or play it on someone with the intention of sacrificing them off. Plus with only one copy in the deck it might not always be in your hand at the ideal time. Very interesting card still, also interesting how they're developing spirit to include this theme of death and resurrection now.\n\nThe dwarf trader is a nice unique addition the ability may be useful but I think he'll mostly get seen in dwarf decks featuring spirit since it was already pointed out they lacked non-unique dwarf allies.\n\nIthilien lookout is certainly the card I'm looking forward to the most (among the cards that weren't already spoiled that is). I'm really pleased that this is arguably the first \"secrecy\" card that can still be used reliably and efficiently in non-secrecy decks. That ability is really great and obviously combines with a lot of other lore cards to make sure you take out an enemy. If you are using secrecy a phenomenal combo will be with risk some light (which I think is an underrated card to begin with) for what I think would be a secrecy cost of 1 you could look at top 3, put worst card at the bottom then kill off the worst enemy among the cards before it appears. The lookout obviously draws comparisons to ithilien archer but as a primarily solo player the lookout is a more ideal choice for me that can always be changed if I play with more people. It's nice to have choices even among the archetypes"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1128450","commentId":1128450,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1403358185,"content":"Shuffling a card back into a deck is a feature I am valuing more and more.

Unless you are going to sing Spirit, you are not going to keep it secret for long, but the opening round or two can give you some advantage.

The key card is Resourceful, for overcoming lore's resource lack. This plus the strong draw form the basis for playing a bunch of allies. Elf stone can put in some of the more expensive ones. Secrecy is not maintained for long, but if you can get in one resourceful, that's usually enough. A timely elf-stoned Gandalf helps. Ithilien lookout will fit this deck perfectly (once I get it)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1129652","commentId":1129652,"userName":"kyrie","timestamp":1403488230,"content":"Yes, Blue Mountain Trader does create an infinite defense loop combo with Harbor Master.

He should cost 1 more resource than Ithilien Lookout when comparing stats. And if you're playing multiplayer, then his Sentinel and Ranged can be very handy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/109099-full-dunland-trap-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=1131374","commentId":1131374,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1403603092,"content":"I just generally happy to see allies that support secrecy. And of all the deck archetypes, the ranger decks make the most sense as secrecy decks. The stats on both are pretty epic for their cost once secrecy is factored in.
