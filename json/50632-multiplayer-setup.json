You don't need any additional cards from the second core set (that's only for player cards and threat trackers). You just reveal one card for each player  from the encounter deck each quest phase. (Yes, it gets easier with more players)\n\nYou should have 2 3A/3B cards for passage through mirkwood \"Don't leave the path\" & \"Beorn's Path\", and only one 1A card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50632-multiplayer-setup/?do=findComment&comment=505860","commentId":505860,"userName":"shadowleaper","timestamp":1311917269,"content":" Thanks for the help mate!\n\nYes, I meant 2 -3A/3B cards.  However, do i use both or choose one to play with?  >.>"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50632-multiplayer-setup/?do=findComment&comment=505880","commentId":505880,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1311922042,"content":"Include both and just play through the quest from 1A...all will be revealed"}]}
