I like the creativity behind the quest design that already shows through. So we get our first \"One-Card quest\"! I imagine this to be quite funny, since the locations will probably provide some fairly brutal conditions and we still have to face enemies that prevent us from putting those progress counters on the locations!\n\nI can imagine that Spirit's allies (Northern Tracker and Lorien Guide) might prove very useful. And Legolas will probably take a break on this one!\n\nNow that I have the core set, I thought waiting on the Adventure Packs would be easy...turns it out it just made want those pack really desperately."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46591-discussion-the-hills-of-emyn-muil/?do=findComment&comment=466482","commentId":466482,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1305061351,"content":"I gotta be honest here:\n\n \n\nAs cool as this Adventure Pack looks, and as glad as I am to be getting new information about this game, I would really have liked to hear a release date for Hunt for Gollum instead..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46591-discussion-the-hills-of-emyn-muil/?do=findComment&comment=466485","commentId":466485,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1305062161,"content":"Yes i feel the same but not so much for the extra cards or the new scenarios but more for the new characters.There are so many characters i want to see in this game which makes any  adventure pack a must have for me.\n\nps: I WANT GALADRIEL AND I WANT HER NOW babeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46591-discussion-the-hills-of-emyn-muil/?do=findComment&comment=466489","commentId":466489,"userName":"BudSinigaglio","timestamp":1305062932,"content":"servant of the secret fire said:\n\nYes i feel the same but not so much for the extra cards or the new scenarios but more for the new characters.There are so many characters i want to see in this game which makes any  adventure pack a must have for me.\n\nps: I WANT GALADRIEL AND I WANT HER NOW babeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]\n\n\n\nYour avatar gave you away..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46591-discussion-the-hills-of-emyn-muil/?do=findComment&comment=466493","commentId":466493,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1305064600,"content":"I just hope ffg will assign the art of Galadriel to the same guy who made The favor of Galadriel card.Perfect is the only ward i can say for this avatar and i can't think a better Galadreil than this one.\n\nI salute you Magali Villeneuve."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46591-discussion-the-hills-of-emyn-muil/?do=findComment&comment=466497","commentId":466497,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1305065417,"content":"Well, yes, it actually is disappointing that we didn't get any news on the Hunt for Gollum adventure pack.
