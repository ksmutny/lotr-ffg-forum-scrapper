It is the One Ring that says if it is removed from play, players lose.  What I am confused about is that per the campaign rules if any hero dies, they become a fallen hero. So Frodo dies, he becomes a Fallen hero and can't be used. There are no other Ring Bearers so it is impossible to win. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/251505-frodos-hit-points-and-campaign-mode/?do=findComment&comment=2823473","commentId":2823473,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1496717295,"content":"> Just now, syrilian said:\n> \n> That makes sense but technically it is not in the rules nor on his card.
