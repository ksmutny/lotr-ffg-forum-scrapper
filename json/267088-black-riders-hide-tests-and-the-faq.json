When an encounter card with the Hide X keyword is revealed, the player who revealed the card must make a Hide test. If the encounter card with the Hide X keyword also has a “When Revealed” or “Forced” effect, the Hide test must be resolved before resolving the rest of the card.\n\nHow I think a failed Hide test in the case of a Black Rider (BR) is supposed to work:\n\n1. Reveal BR\n\n2. Add BR to staging area\n\n3. Perform Hide test\n\n4. Fail Hide test\n\n5. BR engages player\n\n6. BR makes attack\n\n \n\nBut where to we find a reference for the placement of step 2? This is important of course, because if step 2 comes after the Hide test, the forced engagement and attack won't trigger.\n\nThen there's this from the FAQ:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Q: When an enemy makes an attack as part of its “when revealed” effect, is that enemy in the staging area?\n> \n> A: No. Enemies are added to the staging after resolving their “when revealed” effects. An enemy that makes an attack as part of its “when revealed” effect, is not in the staging area or engaged with the defending player unless a card effect says it is.\n\nNow, the phrasing of the Hide X rules specifically say \"When an encounter card with the Hide X keyword is revealed\". Wouldn't this mean that in fact Hide X should trigger before the BR is in the staging area (albeit after other \"When Revealed\" effects that may be printed on the card)? This would mean nearly everyone (myself included) has been playing this wrong. How do we resolve it?\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/267088-black-riders-hide-tests-and-the-faq/?do=findComment&comment=3159772","commentId":3159772,"userName":"Ywingscum","timestamp":1515428422,"content":"Sounds to me when you reveal a black rider, hide test is performed immediately and if failed engages you immediately never entering the staging area.\n\nthe text in the quest card is a cover all in case hide tests can be made in other situations "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/267088-black-riders-hide-tests-and-the-faq/?do=findComment&comment=3159858","commentId":3159858,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1515430370,"content":"> 39 minutes ago, Seastan said:\n> \n> Now, the phrasing of the Hide X rules specifically say \"When an encounter card with the Hide X keyword is revealed\".

Unfortunately, that’s not how the scenario is intended to work. When a Black Rider is revealed and you fail its Hide 2 test, it is meant to engage you and attack. I think everyone involved in developing this scenario understood this intent so intuitively that no one bothered to scrutinize the timing as closely as you have.\n> \n>  \n> \n> As a result, it will probably be necessary to errata each quest stage to change the phrase “each Nazgul enemy in the staging area” to “each unengaged Nazgul enemy in play.” In the meantime, you can choose to play it as written or as intended.
