Have not had a chance to read it all yet but gave it a once over. Another well crafted rulebook as I would expect from FFG will look great beside my other LCG rulebooks. I especially like the turn sequence chart at the end, good idea.\n\nI also noted the time frame was clarified. Its between the 111th birthday party and days before the day that Frodo and Sam take off on their journey."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43778-the-rules-are-coming-run-you-fools/?do=findComment&comment=438126","commentId":438126,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1300138912,"content":" This is a good update, I guess.

Also completely unknown scenarios seems like it would be very random in that you would have no way to really practice or evaluate your deck prior to the tournament.\n\nOf course the idea of truly competitive play for a co-op game seems very difficult from a judges stand point.  After all participants are competing for the best score, but not directly against their opponents, so I am curious how judges could keep track of if people are playing by the rules correctly, or cheating when there is no opponent to call those things to a judges attention?\n\n \n\nThe game still seems very interesting and I plan on picking up two copies of the core set for my group to try out.  I just think that the apparent lack of official scenario deck building rules seems like a big missed opportunity for creating more variety in the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43778-the-rules-are-coming-run-you-fools/?do=findComment&comment=439309","commentId":439309,"userName":"Frank36","timestamp":1300335686,"content":"Karazax said:\n\n I was kind of disappointed that there don't seem to be any official scenario creation rules.  \n\nI'm sure there will be a nice expansion for this when the game is established.\n\n \n\nKarazax said:\n\nIt will be interesting to see how tournament play develops.  \n\nThere are many people (including me) that have no interest in tournament play."}]}
