I haven't used OCTGN before but I'm just wondering if you are able to play LOTR solo or if you have to play with another player. It's not that I don't enjoy playing with other players, but sometimes when building out a deck I enjoy building a deck online so I can test it out quickly, or see what cards I need to purchase etc."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79283-updated-octgn-release/?do=findComment&comment=765524","commentId":765524,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1361404577,"content":"You can definitely play solo.  I do that all the time. \n\nThe one problem with OCTGN is the lack of a \"save game\" feature.  You can save and load decks, but once you start a game, you have to either finish it or quit without saving.\n\nIf you want to be able to save your game, I recommend LackeyCCG.  Its interface isn't as polished as OCTGN, but it's perfectly fine as a virtual card table."}]}
