Especially, I found the backstory of Rossiel to be really compelling, making her a character I want to play although I was a bit skeptical about the whole theme/mechanics of victory display manipulation in the first place. Now I'd like to play elven magic.\n\n \n\nI would be really really cool if you could give us the backstories of the other FFG-created heroes, namely Thalin, Eleanor, Beravor, Mirlonde and Caldara. I know some of them where already part of Middle-Earth quest RPG (the first three of them), so maybe part of my request can already be found somewhere. Anyway, I think it'd be a great addition to the \"support\" section online. I realise there's some work involved here, but I'm asking nonetheless.\n\n \n\nPS: Oh and even the few unique allies you created along the way: Emery, Brok Ironfist, Henemarth Riversong and the next Eldahir, could we know just in a few lines who those fine free-people are?\n\n \n\nThanks for the amazing game  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited November 24, 2015 by banania"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194272-ffg-created-heroes-please-ffg-give-us-backstories/?do=findComment&comment=1905777","commentId":1905777,"userName":"Qaanaaq","timestamp":1448365432,"content":"Backstory for Ingold > Count me In for Gold. \n\nI think there is too many named allies.

Would be really cool to get some fluff from FFG to flesh out these characters. \n\n \n\nAlso, let's be honest, it would be good practice for FFG as we ramp up for Legend of the Five Rings. That's an IP that is going to require them to seriously up their game as far as community storytelling goes and the established history and fanbase of LotR is a good place for them to take some baby-steps there. \n\n \n\nDO NOT want to see them do too much more storytelling through the quests though--at least not for named, unique characters. I thought it was really cool with Amarthiul but it really kind of bugs me as someone who does not build for specific quests that the quest limits my hero choice..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194272-ffg-created-heroes-please-ffg-give-us-backstories/?do=findComment&comment=1906651","commentId":1906651,"userName":"Tomdidiot","timestamp":1448404711,"content":"I actually quite like named/unique allies.  FFG tends to put more interesting effects on them, or make them more powerful, in ways that make them far more fun to play with compared to their non-unique counterparts (See Orophin vs Silverlode Archer or Arwen vs 2 cost spirit allies).  It also gives a better sense of immersion.\n\n \n\nI think Thalin, Eleanor and Beravor were originally from Middle-Earth Quest, and there may be some background material in that game, though I'm not 100% sure.\n\nEdited November 24, 2015 by Tomdidiot"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194272-ffg-created-heroes-please-ffg-give-us-backstories/?do=findComment&comment=1906698","commentId":1906698,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1448406818,"content":"I support this.
