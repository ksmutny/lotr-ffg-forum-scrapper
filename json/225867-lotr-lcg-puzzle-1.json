I have returned to the game after a longish break and am enjoying having a crack at the puzzles you devised while I was away. I suspect they are well above my paygrade, so to speak, but I'll give them a crack!\n\nI did the Balin's Revenge puzzle first, in which the player starts with all cards in hand and unlimited resources. Earlier in this thread you said about the first puzzle:\n\n> On 27/07/2016 at 1:20 AM, Seastan said:\n> \n> Just imagine it as a regular game. You start with a random deck and random hand. At some point in the game, play Shadows Give Way. There are no time constraints, so you can simply wait to draw into anything you need.\n\nIf there are no time (and presumably threat?) constraints, then presumably at some point the player will have drawn their entire deck and will have a infinitely large pool of resources.\n\nShould I approach this puzzle with that assumption (i.e. I can play any card, at any time, without needing to consider its cost), or does my solution need to be along the lines of: \"in my starting hand I draw card X, Y, Z... I spend 1 of Denethor 's resource to play X. Denethor now has 0 resources.\"?\n\nEDIT: Nevermind, I have just gone ahead and posted my solution on ringsdb. Any assumptions that I made about which cards are in hand, and my heroes' ability to pay for them, are explained in the solution.\n\nEdited August 10, 2017 by jnicol"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/225867-lotr-lcg-puzzle-1/?do=findComment&comment=2921547","commentId":2921547,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1502373882,"content":"> 16 hours ago, jnicol said:\n> \n>  \n\nThanks for your attempts at the puzzles! Sorry that I do not have time to address them all individually.

Rather than scrying the encounter deck first to ensure that the test failed, I did a blind test and named the \"hero\" card type, on the assumption that there would not be 3 heroes on top of the encounter deck :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"}]}
