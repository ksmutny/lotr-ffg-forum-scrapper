Especially leading up to unto their annual livestream and future products announcement. And with all of the above it seems to me at least like LOTR isn’t as dead as many think it is after this cycle. They obviously recognize that it’s a popular property and are still pushing even the older LOTR games. \n \n\nAlso there was the interview with the head of Asmodee who stated (More or less) that the market was flooded with games and that a focus will be on expanding existing games with established lines. This definitely describes the LCG. \n \n\nSo regardless of what things look like post-break, I’m optimistic that we are going to get more content, and here is hoping for some more campaign material and contracts! \n \n\nAnyone else pick up on this and have any hopes or thoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309531-optimistic-about-lotr-lcg%E2%80%99s-future/?do=findComment&comment=3958158","commentId":3958158,"userName":"Zura","timestamp":1593720356,"content":"I really want to believe that, but a lot has been indicating otherwise, and the LOTR-related announcements at the same time is probably just a coincidence.

They're less player dependant and as such, there's more variance. \nMajority of the game happens in the player deck, no matter how you look at it. It's how you play the game. While there's some tailoring against the scenario, players make decks to achieve some results using different playstyles. It defines the experience much more than the scenario. \n\nI would also risk saying the whole \"infinite\" deckbuilding thing is a bit of overstatement, imo. When you stop looking at the combinations of cards and start looking at actual deck foundations avaiable, the amount shrinks to around 40-50 (just spitballing numbers, but i bet it's around here) viable strategies, like \"a cotw deck with repeating events, a secrecy with ally swarming with very good tale/timely aid, a boromir fire/blood, fellowship rush, trait deck swarms, etc, etc\". While you can make a gondor swarm in variety of ways, it does not create a distuinguishable enough experience for the player to feel like there's a lot of variety going on. \n\nI ran through your thought experiment and i believe it would be much more enjoyable to run 116 different player decks against a single solid quest than vice versa. Your own strategy you're executing can burn you out, the uncontrollable encounter less so, as you're still getting your puzzle.\n\nIf you think about it, the player cardpool is actually still not that big and same staples are the foundation of most solid decks. This is not a criticism as the game couldn't take ToW's or steward's ban because it was designed around their existence, but after almost 10 years the core set staples have no real competition.\n\nIt's almost impossible to bore yourself with 116 quests, while the cardpool does feel claustrophobic to me at times. As you feel like you \"mastered\" the \"big\" archetypes you're really just push to crappy gimmick decks. And i love them of course, but tbh i feel we still need more player cards, even at the expense of the 116th and 117th quest, as 1 single staple player card can reinvigorate the pool (contracts) the way a quest cannot provide."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309531-optimistic-about-lotr-lcg%E2%80%99s-future/?do=findComment&comment=3970814","commentId":3970814,"userName":"General_Grievous","timestamp":1596675882,"content":"Why not both?

You wouldn't play 1 quest with 116 decks though. You would get soooo bored.\n\n\nI guess I'm the exact opposite, in this regard.  I would get exceptionally bored playing the same deck for 116 quests.  I was trying to do a \"The One Deck\" Gray Wanderer deck, and I almost disliked my deck after running through just the first 22 Quests (through Heirs of Numenor) and had to put it down.  That's not even 20% of the quests in the game.  I'll certainly return to it at some point, but I really needed a change of pace with some radically different decks.  On the other hand, I'm sure I've played some quests more than two dozen times, as I've got a lot of different decks and play not only solo but with two other groups of players.  I'm sure I've played Journey Along the Anduin (my go-to first test quest for a new deck) at least 100 times, and I am positive that I'd have much more fun playing Journey Along the Anduin for the 100th time with a new deck than I'd have playing the 100th new quest with the same single deck.\n\nAll of the groups I play with tend to grab our decks and then try to run them through a cycle, or at least a series of linear quests.  I honestly don't know how other players/groups would decide what to play... like do so some people build a deck and think \"man I really like Encounter at Amon Din and The Redhorn Gate, so I'm gonna take this deck against those two quests...\"  I suppose the difference may be in how people approach deckbuilding.  I tend to be more in the \"The One Deck\" kind of camp, and build decks that are intended to take on host of quests, while other people view deckbuilding as something you do with a particular quest in mind.  For people who build decks AGAINST each individual quest, since with that approach you're basically looking at each quest as a challenge to unravel and beat, once that's done... maybe it doesn't have much replayability because you've already built and proven what you think is the best tech against that quest..?  For me, I view deck-building as an exercise in trying to build decks (especially thematic ones) that are robust and flexible enough to tackle an entire cycle worth of quests... so for me I find myself happily replaying the same cycle of quests over and over because the novelty is seeing how a new deck responds (or fails to handle) to the challenges of those quests, and a series of quests are the metric by which a deck is evaluated.    \n\nThere are still lots of archetypes I have never even tried, and lots and lots of unexplored variations of archetypes I have tried, so I don't think lack of variety in Player Cards is pressing issue.  But if we were to be graced with new content, and I had to pick either new player cards OR new quests, hands-down I know I'd get the most excitement and mileage from new player cards, because I'm sure I could play the existing 116 Quests for an eternity and not get bored with the game.  And having a 117 or 118 or 222 available quests wouldn't really change that much.  Having another twenty heroes or six new contracts or thirty new attachments... that however would certainly be felt and appreciated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/309531-optimistic-about-lotr-lcg%E2%80%99s-future/?do=findComment&comment=3971085","commentId":3971085,"userName":"Kjeld","timestamp":1596733857,"content":"> 1 hour ago, EBerling said:\n> \n> Having another twenty heroes or six new contracts or thirty new attachments\n\nHonestly, more contracts are probably the single most efficient means to mix up the game. This could be a vehicle for accomplishing my second point above, especially if the contracts started messing with not just deck-building and player rules, but also the encounter deck rules. Imagine a contract that gave a big player boost, but also let the encounter deck reveal an additional card per round. Or a contract that allowed players to have two active locations at a time, or one which introduced a variable \"traitor\" element into the game which could strike you at any point unawares.
