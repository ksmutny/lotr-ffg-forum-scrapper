Besides playing the official content i also love to play Fan Made Quests made by the community .\n\nI used to have a ton of fan made content on my previous computer before it broke down. Now i'm searching for some old content to play.\n\nI played many english quests already but would like to try some spannish ones in this site: http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com/p/creaciones-propias_3818.html [http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com/p/creaciones-propias_3818.html]\n\nAfter playing the official Hobbit Saga (Over Hill and Under Hill + On the Doorstep) i would really love to try a fan-made version of Bilbo's story, sadly this 7-part saga seems to be broken on the 1st adventure. ( http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com/2014/11/destellos-de-endor-hiv-i-una-tertulia.html [http://susurrosdelbosqueviejo.blogspot.com/2014/11/destellos-de-endor-hiv-i-una-tertulia.html] ). I managed to get all other adventures (2nd through 7th on the dropbox)\n\nSo i came here with a cry for help, has anyone previously played/downloaded this Saga? I'm looking for the 1st quest and the rules ( Reglas Historia de una Ida y una Vuelta ).\n\nThe creator of these (and other) quests is known as \"Filgonfin\" (David), but i don't know how to contact him, i sent a mail to this Sussuros Del Bosque site owner, but got a reply from \"Mndela\" but he doesn't know how to contact Filgonfin/David. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Finally, i'm much more confortable with english than spannish, so if anyone ever translated these adventures that would be a great boon too. \n\nIs there any hero out there who will lend their hand in assisting me in finding this quest? ?\n\nThank you very much in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284848-historia-de-una-ida-y-una-vuelta-i-una-tertulia-inesperada-searching-for-fan-made-quest/?do=findComment&comment=3511147","commentId":3511147,"userName":"Strilar","timestamp":1540224588,"content":"Still no help? ?\n\n \n\nMe and a friend took a week of vacations and our main plan was to play as much of LotR LCG as we can. We already did many official adventures but want to do a bunch of fan-mades first. If possible quests that would use the Hobbit Saga encounters or would be in the same theme as Bilbo's journeys.\n\nWho here plays fan-made LotR quests?\n\nHeres the list of all Custom content (and respective makers) i found so far, if anyone knows more quests i can get please let me know:\n\n "}]}
