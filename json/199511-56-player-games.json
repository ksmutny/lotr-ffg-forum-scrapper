Though, it looks like it's mostly a 1-4 player game. That said, is there any way to play with up to 6 players?\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199511-56-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=1998653","commentId":1998653,"userName":"DunedainLoreKeeper","timestamp":1453153465,"content":"I don't think so. 4 player already stretches the limit of the game due to how Locations work. You would have to use a lot of house rules to make it happen somehow. I would definately recommend another game in this case."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199511-56-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=1998663","commentId":1998663,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1453153679,"content":"I've done it with 5 a couple of times but wouldn't recommend it.  Some quests outright break if you have more than 4 players (usually not enough of a key encounter card for each player, or some special deck gets depleted way too fast)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199511-56-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=1998670","commentId":1998670,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1453153830,"content":"I've played a handful of games 5 player.  It's not ideal, but you can technically do it.  At the very least, I would houserule it so you can have 2 active locations.  Also, many quests will be completely unbeatable while some may be trivial at 5-6 players.\n\n \n\nBut just because you can doesn't mean you should.  If I had 6 people that wanted to play LotR, I would recommend splitting into 2 tables."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199511-56-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=1998902","commentId":1998902,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1453161228,"content":"> I've played a handful of games 5 player.  It's not ideal, but you can technically do it.  At the very least, I would houserule it so you can have 2 active locations.  Also, many quests will be completely unbeatable while some may be trivial at 5-6 players.\n> \n>  \n> \n> But just because you can doesn't mean you should.  If I had 6 people that wanted to play LotR, I would recommend splitting into 2 tables.\n\n \n\nI agree with the splitting up idea.  Even if you have 5, you can do a two-player and three-player game which would probably be better than 5 in most cases.  If multiple people are going to be owning the game then each group can play the same scenario and it would give you something to talk about afterward."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199511-56-player-games/?do=findComment&comment=1999287","commentId":1999287,"userName":"azureeternal","timestamp":1453176883,"content":"Thanks for the feedback, everyone.

You're a braver man than I. Would never play that with more than 4. You want some Cthulhu w/ 5-8, break out Elder Sign. Maybe Eldritch, though I still prefer that in the 2-4 range. "}]}
