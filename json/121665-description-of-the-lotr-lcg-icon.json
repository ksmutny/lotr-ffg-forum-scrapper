I have some doubt.\n\n \n\nAs I see it :\n\n 1.  Progress token - some footprints on dirt\n 2.  Damage token - some open wound\n 3.  Ressource token - ?????\n 4.  Threat icon - sauron's helm ?\n 5.  Willpower icon - a sun ?\n 6.  Attack icon - obviously two axes crossed.\n 7.  Defense icon - obviously a shield.\n 8.  Lore icon - a book, any book ?\n 9.  Leadership icon - obviously Gandalf's rune, why is gandalf not leadership then ?\n 10. Tactic icon - a sword, maybe sword that is broken ?\n 11. Spirit icon - ?????\n 12. Fellowship icon - obviously the one ring\n 13. Baggins icon - obviously a pipe\n 14. Scenario icons - nothing here that comes to mind\n 15. \"Pack\" icons - I found ringmaker's cycle icon a bit obscure...\n\n \n\nalso : why is there no icon for hit point and hero threat ? \n\n \n\nI lake lotr lore, so that's why I'm missing ressource token and spirit icon.\n\nWhat do you think ? do you wonder what some icons are ?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121665-description-of-the-lotr-lcg-icon/?do=findComment&comment=1256619","commentId":1256619,"userName":"MightyRauros","timestamp":1410359342,"content":"3.

Since it's a generic coin, it doesn't have a picture of a president or anything, but it has a fancy ridge. It might be some kind of silvery or clear gem in the middle, which would give it that reflection from the curvature.\n\nEdited September 11, 2014 by joezim007"}]}
