It explains that, essentially, the players are not questing. Instead, the encounter deck is attempting to quest against the players. Progress is made by the encounter deck when the threat level is higher than the will power of characters committed to the quest (instead of raising threat level like normal).\n\nYou advance to stage five by getting 8 resources on the defense of Helm's Deep card.
