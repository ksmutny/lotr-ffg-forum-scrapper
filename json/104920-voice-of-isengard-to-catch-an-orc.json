Mugash comes when you have explored some locations. When Mugash is in play and you win the quest placing progress tokens on the quest card, then, you pass to 3a-3b. In this round you must be ready for catching mugash, and you have 2 more rounds to place all the progress tokens you need in 3b to win the game. 2 rounds are ok for do it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104920-voice-of-isengard-to-catch-an-orc/?do=findComment&comment=1065766","commentId":1065766,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1398751270,"content":"This quest have a one big flaw.

My memory did not serve me well there; though with the amount of different quests and card text with special rules it is bound to happen from time to time.\n\nWith a small change you can still use this general approach though: get Mugash to 1 or 2 hp, as I suggested and wait till he is returned to the staging area and take him out there with Gandalf, Descendant of Thorondor, Hail of Stones etc to max the amount of time you have to place progress tokens."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104920-voice-of-isengard-to-catch-an-orc/?do=findComment&comment=1066297","commentId":1066297,"userName":"player723290","timestamp":1398792631,"content":"Glaurung how do I find you on youtube?

When Mugash appears, sacrifice one of your allies when he attacks. Next turn you play Gandalf, place 4 damage tokens on Mugash, try to make at least one progress (or not, if I still have all time counters left) and hit him with Gandalf plus some other good hitters. After that everyone but one characters quests. Here it helps to have the one or the other card that boosts your WP."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104920-voice-of-isengard-to-catch-an-orc/?do=findComment&comment=1067294","commentId":1067294,"userName":"player723290","timestamp":1398868673,"content":"i saw the video... great!\n\nwhat a deck...!\n\nI'll try your strategy...!\n\nthanks "}]}
