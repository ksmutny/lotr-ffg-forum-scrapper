Can the -2 DEF be applied to the character attacking because you decide the order in which things resolve, or does the -2 only apply to any attacks after that? For example: I attack with Glorfindel, who has 3 ATK and a Rivendell Blade attatched. If the enemy has 3 defense, does Glorfindel damage the enemy or does he simply lower its defense to 1 for any other readied characters? Just hoping someone can shed some light. Thanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75848-rivendell-blade/?do=findComment&comment=736084","commentId":736084,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1355860977,"content":"First of all, a player can declare only one attack to each enemy engaged with him per turn, unless other effects allow him to declare another attack to the same enemy again.  So if you want to attack a particular enemy egaged with you with several characters you controlled, you must declare them at the same time, combining their attack strength together.\n\nWith that said, Rivendell Blade would reduce the defense strength of the target enemy being attacked in this attack.  So in your example, Glorfindel with an attack strength of 3 equipped with a Rivendell Blade, would deal two damages to a 3 defense strength enemy, even if he attacks alone."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/75848-rivendell-blade/?do=findComment&comment=736085","commentId":736085,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1355861204,"content":"Ahhh right right, understood.
