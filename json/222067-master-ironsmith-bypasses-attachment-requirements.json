Does this mean that I could play something like Elven Spear or even Sword of Morthond on Tactics Boromir if he paid for the Ironsmith?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222067-master-ironsmith-bypasses-attachment-requirements/?do=findComment&comment=2256488","commentId":2256488,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1465337941,"content":"I believe you cannot bypass the \"Attach to\" rules, because the response on Master Ironsmith specifically says \"attach\".\n\n \n\nDespite you not paying the resource cost for the Weapon or Armor attachment, you still have to verify if the \"attach\" conditions match.\n\n \n\nSo you cannot attach those two weapons you said to Tactics Boromir"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222067-master-ironsmith-bypasses-attachment-requirements/?do=findComment&comment=2257414","commentId":2257414,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1465396145,"content":"This was brought up in another thread, and the consensus seems to be that you cannot get around any \"attach to X\" restrictions, but you could get around limitations that say something like \"play only if you have a Noldor\" like Lembas does.  However, there currently isn't any weapon/armor with that type of restriction.\n\n \n\nThe part of the FAQ you quoted is for attaching something like Blood of Nemenor to a character with the Steward of Gondor attached, which grants them the necessary Gondor trait.  If later, Steward is discarded, Blood of Numenor will stay there since the \"attach to X\" restriction is only required to be met at the moment it was attached.\n\nEdited June 8, 2016 by Slothgodfather"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222067-master-ironsmith-bypasses-attachment-requirements/?do=findComment&comment=2257423","commentId":2257423,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1465396305,"content":"Other thread: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?p=2246236 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/220679-the-thing-in-the-depths-is-shipping-now-by-the-way/?p=2246236]\n\nOriginal source: https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204958-vilya-and-ent-draught/?p=2094740 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/204958-vilya-and-ent-draught/?p=2094740]\n\n \n\n \n\nand nothing else since I got burned by slothgodfather\n\nEdited June 8, 2016 by alogos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222067-master-ironsmith-bypasses-attachment-requirements/?do=findComment&comment=2257570","commentId":2257570,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1465400868,"content":"> and nothing else since I got burned by slothgodfather\n\n \n\neh?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/222067-master-ironsmith-bypasses-attachment-requirements/?do=findComment&comment=2257618","commentId":2257618,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1465402308,"content":"I figured it probably wasn't the intent of the card to bypass the restrictions, but it just seems weird that it is worded differently from similar cards we have had in the past.
