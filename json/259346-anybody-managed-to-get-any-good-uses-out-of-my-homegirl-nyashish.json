It's because of the obvious parallels between cultures in fantasy series and cultures of the real world. Na'asiyah may not be fully Haradrim like Kahliel, but she's a corsair of Umbar, who are of a different culture and race from the European-like Rohirrim, Gondorians, etc, (that is, Southern-Eastern) . Considering the term \"POC\" is intentionally broader than others, yes, I actually do think for all intents and purposes, Na'asiyah could be considered to be a \"POC\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259346-anybody-managed-to-get-any-good-uses-out-of-my-homegirl-nyashish/?do=findComment&comment=2997578","commentId":2997578,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1506376309,"content":"Umbar's a bit of a special case as points south goes in the lore.  It was long a Numenorean outpost before the island fell, and was a central location in the Gondorian civil war.  While the Royal line may be extinct in Umbar, Numenorean blood is certainly there.  In short, I don't think we can assume that someone from Umbar *is* a visibly differently race than the free men of the West, and Na'asiyah herself does not appear to be a different race to me.\n\nDifferent culture I'll happily grant, and with Kahliel and Na'asiyah we certainly see heroes not drawn from the lore's men of the west; with this and the sympathetic portrayal of the Dunlendings we see that the game is finding enemies of Sauron among all of Iluvatur's children and I applaud that; I look forward to seeing Easterlings in the same role as well.  But distinctions between races of men really isn't much of a driver in Tolkien's world.  Tolkien's races (e.g. elves, dwarves, men, hobbits, ents) are actually biologically distinct, unlike the slight differences between \"races\" of men, and the tensions and interaction between them have a prominent role in the lore."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/259346-anybody-managed-to-get-any-good-uses-out-of-my-homegirl-nyashish/?do=findComment&comment=2997622","commentId":2997622,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1506377949,"content":"I personally think Na'asiyah has a definite eastern look which was intended by the art direction, and which I think is great, I mean, her coolness alone is the main reason to try this hero (haven't had much success myself).\n\nAs for Númenorean blood in Umbar, it's definitely there, but consider that it was mostly among the nobility, as well as that by the third millenium of the Third Age, Umbar was moslty populated by Haradrim. You can see that by looking at lots of the art depicting corsairs (Haradrim Pirate from FOTW and Serpent's Blade come to mind.)

If you're hurt just because I couldn't remember her name properly during the time she was spoiled, and then my substitute nickname for her stuck because it sounded kinda cool (to me, obviously) - then jokes on you. You are deliberately choosing to be hurt by something that has no intention to hurt you.\n\nAlso, sexist? What? I googled just in case I had the term \"homegirl\" wrong, but it turned out I had it right: \"homegirl - a girl who is a friend to the end, no matter what goes down you know SHE GOT YOUR BACK\". I can't even begin to imagine what exactly sexist about that. Please, save your SJW impulses for those cases where they are applicible at the very least. Also, oh the irony, being a SJW is really not a behavior to be proud of.\n\n \n\n> 9 hours ago, Gizlivadi said:\n> \n> Use your imagination.
