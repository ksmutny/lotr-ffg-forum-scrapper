Beravor(4-5 UC), Gloin(plate, peak with DK for optimal damage/heal, Common Cause Beravor), Eowyn(Steward, Protector of Lorien)\n\n2. Gimli(Plate(s), some UC, Tooks brings him high threat meat to head off, DK), Theodred(Protector of Lorien), Dunhere(Dark Knowledge, Horn, Common Cause Gimli)\n\nAlso, both decks should have 3 Stewards - this card is just so good and 2nd stage make players discard anyway.\n\nAnyway, for 2 players I'd do 2 crucial changes: ban/restrict/limit Unexpected Courage, ban Gimli or cap his damage.\n\n1. Beravor + mass UC, Protector mass discard = 1-2 turn and it's the end of the stage. Later mass discard is not even really needed because of Faramir + Ever Vigilant combo. Way too easy.\n\n2. Gimli + 1-2 UC (+Common Cause) + plate + mass Tooks bringing all enemies to him = he heads off everything with 1 hit. Even trolls are a joke so something is not right.\n\nOther than that scenario is really good."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49224-new-scenario-high-difficulty-helping-friends/?do=findComment&comment=500554","commentId":500554,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1310829622,"content":"Doh.
