You do not have to trigger it to travel to West Gate and it is fairly useless. The only real benefit or use I can see is being able to travel (or at least make West Gate the active location) outside of the travel phase like during the planning phase for example which on the first turn of the game is actually not bad because it means you can clear West Gate during your first quest phase even if you do have to add another location to staging to do so."}]}
