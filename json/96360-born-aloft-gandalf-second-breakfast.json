Very tricky^^ I use a Tactic/Leadership Deck.\n\n \n\nBut I noticed a synergie which I don´t know befor and of what I think that it´s a little bit to powerfull. I didn´t found anything about it here nor in the FAQ so I want to ask you:\n\n \n\nIs it possible to to play a Gandalf (Core Set), use his ability, attach \"Born aloft\" (http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=176 [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=176]) to him and than take Gandalf back right befor the end of round? If yes I could use Gandalf 6 times :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] .\n\nFurther I could than use \"Second Breakfast\" (http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=174 [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/card.html&id=174]) to take back \"Born aloft\" to my hand. If thats works in a row too, I could use Gandalf 9 times :o [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ohmy.png]\n\n \n\nDon't get me wrong - it´s cool but maybe a little bit overpowered (Cause of 9x 3 card draw,  9x 3 damage tokens or 9x 5 point low threat)\n\n \n\nI wonder that I found it only now.\n\n \n\nWhat do you think about this?\n\nOr is this still illigeal in any way (maybe I have overseen a FAQ information) :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png] ?\n\n \n\nHave a nice week!\n\nEdited January 5, 2014 by Legoland"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=946421","commentId":946421,"userName":"HeavyKaragh","timestamp":1388960749,"content":"I can see no problem there.

The sneak attack gandalf was considered to be the most powerful effect of the core set days and trying to beat Dol Goldur using the core set pretty much required drawing both Sneak Attack and Gandalf in your starting hand.\n\n \n\nDue to the power of sneak attack and the ease at which you can recycle event cards, the designers have to be very careful in the future designing any cards that have an \"enters play\" style effect. These type of effects are very common in MTG but much less so in LotR:LCG. I think this shows that FFG really limited their design space with the sneak attack card. In hindsight it should have been 1 per deck or maybe give it a \"victory 1\" label, but such a change now would provoke a huge outcry due to the popularity of the sneak attack Gandalf combo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=947327","commentId":947327,"userName":"Legoland","timestamp":1389047626,"content":"Hm now I´m confused. At the last weekend, my friend who brougt me to that wonderful game allways tells me that Gandalfs effect is not triggerd if I play it with Sneak attack.

But now I searche many Forums and found that it´s possible.\n\nSo - I know this discussion toke place a thousend times, but please:\n\n \n\nCan I play Sneak attack really with Gandalfs effects?\n\nMy friend said also there is a note at the official FAQ about it. But the only limitation is about Stand and fight no neutral cards).\n\nIf yes I need to fight all Quest again for much better score and I feel like playing harder as I need until today^^\n\n \n\nThanks and good night :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=947347","commentId":947347,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1389048554,"content":"yeah, any cards that enable recycling need to be handled very carefully, and although I tend to favor a light hand with errata, I wouldn't mind a change to Hama and Will of the West.\n\n \n\nSneak Attack definitely can be used with Gandalf as his ability triggers whenever he \"enters play\" not just when he is \"played\" or \"played from hand\" as others have mentioned."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=947367","commentId":947367,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1389049493,"content":"Gandalf's text uses the phrase \"enters play\".\n\nThis is probably not documented anywhere, but for me \"entering play\" means any card being placed face-up on the table.\n\n \n\nenemy, ally, location, and attachment cards all \"enter play\"\n\nTreachery and events cards do not \"enter play\" they are simply \"revealed\" or \"played\".  We often set them on the table for reference, but they really have no place being on the board (ex/ I'll place Feint on top of an enemy to remember that is not attacking, but the card really doesn't belong there)\n\n \n\nOther text that may sound similar to this on other cards includes \"put into play\" and \"play from your hand\"\n\n \n\n\"Put into play\" applies only to player cards. Any card that we place on the table has been \"put into play\".\n\n(on the side \"reveal\" only applies to encounter cards)\n\n\"Play from your hand\" applies only to cards that start in our hands, are paid for with resources, and then \"played\" (\"put into play\" if the card is an ally or attachment).\n\n \n\nHere is a quick example:\n\nAs an event, \"Stand and Fight\" is '\"played\" from my hand by paying 1 resource. Erebor Record Keeper is then \"put into play\" from my discard pile.  Nori and Ori do not trigger since Erebor Record Keeper was not \"played from my hand.\"  Using Sneak Attack to play Erebor Battle Master also does not trigger Nori or Ori. Sneak Attack uses \"put into play\".\n\n \n\nGandalf's card text uses the most high-level wording possible in this game: \"enters play\".  No matter how you do it, if Gandalf is at any time placed face-up in the play-area, you can trigger his response. [note: is he is under a FoS Nameless thing his card text is blank]\n\n \n\nI can't help it, here is another example:\n\nIf at some point in this game there in ally that states \"[ally] get +1ATK when a gondor card is put into play\", Gondorian Discipline will not trigger this effect. While this card does have the Gondor trait, it is an event so it therefore never \"put into play\"\n\n \n\n...community, please tell me if I am way off on this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=947690","commentId":947690,"userName":"Legoland","timestamp":1389076238,"content":"I than you for that detailed answer!

But I started out with English cards anyway and so I will stick to them.

Born aloft is certainly interesting, since Gandalf sticks around the whole turn, but as has been mentioned it is so resource intensive that I would not call it overpowered in the least."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96360-born-aloft-gandalf-second-breakfast/?do=findComment&comment=948002","commentId":948002,"userName":"Legoland","timestamp":1389114111,"content":"> German translations are often beschissen or nicht vorhanden.
