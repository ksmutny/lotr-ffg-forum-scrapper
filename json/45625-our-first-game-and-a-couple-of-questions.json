Yes, in my book. Although there have been posts that are suggesting you still have to travel to the location to remove it from the board, one for the FAQ I guess, but I've been playing the same as you for now.\n\n3. Gandalf is a good card, so deck building tactics that allow multiple uses of him are entirely viable i would have thought. Don't think it is a game breaker though...just yet. Gandalf and sneak attack is a very powerful combo (see seperate thread discussion on that), as was your tactic, but as you found out, the game has ways of foiling your plans.. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45625-our-first-game-and-a-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=457697","commentId":457697,"userName":"Paul Grogan","timestamp":1303480477,"content":"Thanks for the quick replies, just found the encounter section on p.16 and it is clear.\n\nWe were also not 100% sure about Dunhere.  We played it that he can attack a creature in the staging area.  So this means that creature is not engaged, meaning it doesnt attack first.\n\nSo, we had a creature in the staging area with 2 shield icons.  Each turn, Dunhere would wander off, deal 1 damage to it and come back safely."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45625-our-first-game-and-a-couple-of-questions/?do=findComment&comment=457706","commentId":457706,"userName":"Apophenia","timestamp":1303482273,"content":"Paul Grogan said:\n\n \n\nThanks for the quick replies, just found the encounter section on p.16 and it is clear.\n\nWe were also not 100% sure about Dunhere.  We played it that he can attack a creature in the staging area.  So this means that creature is not engaged, meaning it doesnt attack first.\n\nSo, we had a creature in the staging area with 2 shield icons.  Each turn, Dunhere would wander off, deal 1 damage to it and come back safely.\n\n \n\n \n\nYes, that sounds right for Dunhere. He is particularly good at dealing with Goblin Snipers in Journey Down the Anduin.\n\nI think he would really shine in a Spirit/Tactics deck. Eowyn, Dunhere, and Thalin would be good. Slap a Blade of Gondolin and a Dwarven Axe on Dunhere and suddenly you have a 4 attack (5 vs orc) character that gives you a success token when he kills something in the staging area. Keep your threat down with Spirit and quest with Eowyn and Thalin and you might never have to defend. Thalin will weaken all the enemies you plan on having Dunhere kill. (You also only start with 26 threat)"}]}
