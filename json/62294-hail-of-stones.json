From p. 25 of the rule book:\n\n\"Paying Costs\nMany cards are written in a “pay or exhaust X to do Y” manner. When confronted with such a construct, everything before the word “to” is considered the cost, and everything after the word “to” is considered an effect.\n\nCosts can only be payed [sic] with cards or resources that a player controls. If an effect is canceled, the cost is still considered to have been paid.\" [emphasis mine]\n\n "}]}
