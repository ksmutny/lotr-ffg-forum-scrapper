Please feel free to point out rules we've screwed up. I hunkered down and spent the last 2 weeks really making sure I fully understand absolutely every rule, and have read through every single card a few times to make sure I'm not glossing over anything- so hopefully future videos will be less mistake prone, but I find it's easier to make mistakes in OCTGN than it is when playing the physical game.\n\nEdited September 8, 2014 by WWPDSteven"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121476-octgn-conflict-at-the-carrock-playthrough/?do=findComment&comment=1261900","commentId":1261900,"userName":"Ihavebadluck","timestamp":1410702580,"content":"what is octgn?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121476-octgn-conflict-at-the-carrock-playthrough/?do=findComment&comment=1262111","commentId":1262111,"userName":"rekath16","timestamp":1410717929,"content":"I WANT MORE OF THIS STUFFF!!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/121476-octgn-conflict-at-the-carrock-playthrough/?do=findComment&comment=1263512","commentId":1263512,"userName":"WWPDSteven","timestamp":1410799784,"content":"Thanks!

Not seeing the cards in front of you definitely adds to that- playing in OCTGN makes it ore difficult. \n\n \n\nSorry for the mic issue, that was also my boneheaded mistake.  I grabbed a nice new microphone, used it... realized the audio quality was bad, and found that it was because I accidentally set it to record from my computer's built in mic.\n\n \n\nStill workin' it out, but we'll smooth it out :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Thanks for following!"}]}
