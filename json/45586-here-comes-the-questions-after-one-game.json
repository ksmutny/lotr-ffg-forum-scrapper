I won with 51 points, but I'm not all the way sure that I played correctly.\n\nWhat happens when Treachery cards are revealed as shadow cards? There's no \"Shadow:\" text on them, but there is \"When Revealed\" but I don't think that counts. Or does it?\n\nAt some point in the rulebook or tutorial, it said when you draw a Treachery card, you had to resolve it and then draw another card. Is that really a rule or did I imagine it? If so, when does that rule take effect?\n\n46 Threat + 8 threat on dead Theodred (he got that spider web treachery on him and never even had enough resources to untap; Resources are at a premium in this game) + 6 wounds on Aragorn and Gloin - 9 for two defeated monsters = 51.

On P.24 of the rule book it explains what to do with a treachery card if that is drawn to cover an objective card. You resolve the treachery card immediately, and this counts as resolving it, meaning the objective is then free to obtain.\n\nWhere does it say you redraw another card to cover the objective in addition to the treachery card?\n\nEDIT: Ah, mis read your post. You were just stating that the only time you redraw is if you draw an objective card. This sentence has nothing to do with the previous one about treachery cards... my bad.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45586-here-comes-the-questions-after-one-game/?do=findComment&comment=457850","commentId":457850,"userName":"DrNate","timestamp":1303503930,"content":"Acererak said:\n\nTreachery cards don´t apply and then redraw.

But it appears that you just resolve the card and don't draw another to replace it. "}]}
