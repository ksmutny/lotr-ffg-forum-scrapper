However, by looking at some of the art (look at the box illustration, Smaug, Old Tommoddy and that treachery, and also some of the Magali pieces), it looks like the game's getting a more \"traditional\" feel, even if those pieces are indeed digital, or at least lighter and less \"dark and gritty\" than it was in earlier expansions.\n\n \n\nEdit: on a second look, the artist for the boxes and some of the cards for these expansions seems to be Chris Rahn (I don't have OHAUH, so I haven't really looked at it), which is awesome because I love his art in Magic."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70950-its-here/?do=findComment&comment=693089","commentId":693089,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347555029,"content":"true but looking at the cards every one of the player cards spoiled are hers, same with numenor…..now i really like her art as i keep saying, just it seems that all major characters get assigned to her, so a growing proportion of cards that will end up in decks will have the same art\n\nthis probably isnt an issue to most, however seeing the reaction to many people's thoughts on the new hobbit card game (not this one) it seems most favour digital….and not trad. digital but ultra realistic digital, which is one hell of a skill, but just doesnt appeal to me (ok arwen certainly did appeal haha)\n\nperhaps i should do a poll on it\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70950-its-here/?do=findComment&comment=693132","commentId":693132,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1347559351,"content":" hooray, news!\n\nthe box art looks superb and the cards are an intriguing mix so far.  that black arrow card is pretty cool and i like that it further expands the usefulness of \"ranged\" for single player.  i think that card pretty much makes it money in the bank we are going to get a tactics bard hero.\n\nkinda surprised theres a new bilbo; seems like hes going to b even more crucial to the quests this time around too (i suppose he was very important for the 3rd OHUH quest)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70950-its-here/?do=findComment&comment=693140","commentId":693140,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1347559967,"content":"Everything looks amazing!
