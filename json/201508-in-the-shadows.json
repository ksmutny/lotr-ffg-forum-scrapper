The reason this deck doesn't include some \"auto-includes\" like Daeron's Runes, is because I made this deck specifically to avoid conflicts with other decks I already have and do not wish to dismantle.  There is absolutely no reason this deck should not have 3x Daeron's Runes if you're only objective is to have it be as consistent as possible.  Probably one or two Master of the Forge would be worth it as well.\n\n \n\nDagger of Westernesse, Unseen Strike, Trollshaw Scout, and sometimes Blade of Gondolin give you the damage you need to kill just about any non-unique enemy.  Feel free to fiddle with the deck a bit, because I know it's not as efficient as it can be.\n\n \n\nAs I said in an earlier post, this deck is meant for multi-player, and is really weak on questing.  Due to this, cards like Quick Beam, Henamarth, and Mablung have been included to support questing, while Blade of Gondolin/Arod/Thror's Map assists with direct progress placement/location control.  This deck quite enjoys my teammate using Arwen hero as it allows the deck to play more cards that it's going to be drawing anyway (and otherwise would be unable to pay for) and can benefit from Tale of Tinuviel (although Glorfindel is better if you're just going to be using ToT since he will likely have Light of Valinor).  It also enjoys a strong sentinel defender so that I can safely engage one enemy, kill it, and start the engagement chain with Aragorn/Merry/Hour of Wrath (with Hour of Wrath targeting Merry).\n\n \n\nEdit: Also, you can replace Pippin in this deck with Sam, and it still functions in a similar way.  I chose Pippin for two reasons.  Easier access to Fast Hitch and because Steward of Gondor being used in other decks.  It is pretty funny to see Sam get up to like 7 attack, though.\n\n \n\n \n\nAragorn [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Aragorn-tlr]\n\nMerry [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Merry-tbr]\n\nPippin [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Pippin-tbr]\n\n \n\nAllies (14)  \n\n 3x Defender of Rammas [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Defender-of-Rammas-hon]\n\n 3x Honour Guard [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Honour-Guard-twoe]\n\n 2x Trollshaw Scout [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Trollshaw-Scout-fos]\n\n 3x Vassal of the Windlord [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Vassal-of-the-Windlord-tdm]\n\n 1x Henamarth Riversong [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Henamarth-Riversong-core]\n\n 1x Mablung [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Mablung-tlos]\n\n 1x Quickbeam [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Quickbeam-tos]\n\nAttachments (19)  \n\n 1x Arod [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Arod-tos]\n\n 3x Blade of Gondolin [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Blade-of-Gondolin-core]\n\n 3x Dagger of Westernesse [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Dagger-of-Westernesse-tbr]\n\n 3x Rohan Warhorse [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Rohan-Warhorse-voi]\n\n 3x Fast Hitch [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Fast-Hitch-tdm]\n\n 1x Thror's Map [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Thror%27s-Map-thohauh]\n\n 2x Wingfoot [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Wingfoot-nie]\n\n 3x Good Meal [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Good-Meal-trg]\n\nEvents (17)  \n\n 3x Feint [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Feint-core]\n\n 3x Foe-hammer [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Foe-hammer-thohauh]\n\n 3x Hour of Wrath [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Hour-of-Wrath-tdr]\n\n 1x Unseen Strike [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Unseen-Strike-trg]\n\n 2x In the Shadows [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/In-the-Shadows-tlos]\n\n 3x Peace, and Thought [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Peace,-and-Thought-saf] \n\n 2x Take No Notice [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Take-No-Notice-tbr]\n\nEdited February 5, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201508-in-the-shadows/?do=findComment&comment=2068707","commentId":2068707,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1456299094,"content":"Did someone ask Caleb about this?\n\n \n\nThere FAQ-entry about Lasting Effects is nice but there are many encounter cards with lasting effects which use the word \"currently\" and those effects cannot be recalculated.\n\nWhile player cards never uses currently ...\n\nEdited February 24, 2016 by JanB"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201508-in-the-shadows/?do=findComment&comment=2069024","commentId":2069024,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1456323248,"content":"deleted because I read more closely and changed my mind...\n\nEdited February 24, 2016 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201508-in-the-shadows/?do=findComment&comment=2069049","commentId":2069049,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1456323884,"content":"> Disagree. I think, with the new FAQ ruling, the word \"currently\" is now completely redundant on old encounter cards.... ignore it.\n\nHmm??? \n\n \n\nI think I misunderstand you.  The word \"currently\" on encounter cards means they do not recalculate.  The omission of the word currently on an encounter card means it will check for updates.\n\n \n\nThe ruling distinguished player cards from encounter cards so what is true for player cards is no longer (necessarily) true for encounter cards.  Basically, if player cards used the word currently, it would be redundant.  But \"currently\" on an encounter card still has meaning.\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> (1.55) Lasting Effects\n> \n>  \n> \n> There are two classes of lasting effects in the game: those created by player cards and those created by encounter cards. Each class is handled differently as follows: A lasting effect created by a player card ability must be calculated at the time that the ability is triggered, and that effect is not recalculated if the game state changes.\n> \n>  \n> \n> A lasting effect created by an encounter card ability, is recalculated if the game state changes. [emphasis mine]\n\n \n\nI guess your interpretation of the bold part means you ignore the word currently altogether because the effect after the word currently is still a lasting effect?  My interpretation is that the word \"currently\" overrides this FAQ ruling as it is explicit in what it is targeting and thus it would not recalculate if say an enemy was later added to the staging area and a treachery was previously revealed that increased the threat of each enemy \"currently\" in the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201508-in-the-shadows/?do=findComment&comment=2069053","commentId":2069053,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1456323989,"content":"Yeah, I just deleted my original response because they left that bit about \"currently\" vs cards without \"currently\" in the FAQ (Treacherous Fog vs Driven by Shadow)"}]}
