I also encourage to explore more obscure cultures and races different from the more normal ones (awesome to see Harad allies, even though I was hoping for Dunland allies in the Ring-Maker cycle). In fact this game is quite conservative compared to its other two predecessors, so I find hard to complain about stuff like the Prancing Pony villains and seafaring as some did. In most other big LOTR games they name the ringwraiths and give them different characters, which doesn't happen here, and IMO works better since they are not actually playable. But since they've shown interest in making non-free peoples characters, some may come later, as there's so many places in Middle Earth yet to explore. Lastly, I'll reiterate that I would be really disappointed if the game ended without exploring the themes of artifacts and corruption, as well as Bombadil and Goldberry player cards of some sort. Blue Wizards is just a wishful dream, so I don't really consider it. \n\nEdited August 12, 2016 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227413-how-far-from-the-source-material-are-you-willing-to-let-the-game-take-you/?do=findComment&comment=2360991","commentId":2360991,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1470980918,"content":"Hey!

For me, the vibe tolkien-vibe is essentially rooted in the art... some arts I like some I don't. For exemple, the Hail of Stone artwork is too \"comic-bookish\" to bring me the tolkien-vibe that I enjoy. As far as it comes to explore the world of Middle-Earth, they can carry me anywhere with this game, as long as they don't actually create locations that would be absolute world-changing... say, a Capital of Haradrims in the middle of the desert while tolkien never ever hinted such things... Still, this is pretty much a game, and Middle-Earth is pretty much a imaginary places... there is no such thing as \"cultural appropriations\"... and as far as I am concerned, the designers did a pretty nice job of staying in themes! Of course, I am almost finishing the Against the Shadow cycle, so I am not that fare into the game. I have the feeling that the Angmar Awaken cycle is a little less \"Professor Tolkien, the linguist and myth-weaver\" and a little more \"Peter Jsckson, the director of Braindead and The Feeble\", but then again, might be wrong..."}]}
