In one part of that scenario it instructs you to remove from the game any card that heals damage on Wilyador, the eagle. Normally Glorfindel's ability is limited to once per round.\n\nI hope that helps, and welcome to the game!\n\n[blast, Radiskull beat me to it, but I'm publishing this anyway since I took the time to write it!]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63002-new-player-dumb-questions/?do=findComment&comment=617060","commentId":617060,"userName":"Schmiegel","timestamp":1334272962,"content":" Thank you, that helps very much!  A couple more questions... Dunhere's special ability allows him to target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone. So as an example, say the threat level for his controlling player is 29 and there is an Ungoliant Spawn (32) in the staging area. During the hero attack component of the Combat phase, Dunhere could gallop out to the staging area and attack the Ungoliant Spawn before it had a chance to attack.. Is there any downside to this? Does Dunhere have to stay engaged with the Ungoliant Spawn now that he has attacked it..? Or does that move the Ungoliant Spawn into an engaged posture against the player that controls Dunhere..? Or, is Dunhere simply able to return to his fellow heroes and begin a regular turn again the following round? (And maybe gallop out alone again if the Ungoliant Spawn has to remain in the staging area?)\n\nAnother question pertains to \"Don't Leave the Path\" (3B) of the Passage Through Mirkwood quest. The text states..When Revealed: Each player must search the encounter deck and discard pile for one Spider card of his choice, and add it to the staging area. The players must find and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn to win this game. \n\nSo can the Ungoliant's Spawn be one of the spiders that the players \"find\" in the encounter deck? And would it be a legal play to then drop a Forest Snare onto the Ungoliant's Spawn and prevent it from ever attacking?\n\nOne last question...If a card's Shadow effect is \"Defending player must choose and discard 1 attachment he controls\", what would happen if the defending player controlled no attachments? Is there any other penalty, or is it just no harm, no foul..?\n\nAgain, thanks in advance for any insights!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63002-new-player-dumb-questions/?do=findComment&comment=617064","commentId":617064,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1334275380,"content":" Dunhere is free to attack with no strings attached. He's awesome! Of course, the problem with attacking alone is that there are some enemies he won't be able to damage without getting other attack boosts. Still, I love Dunhere's ability.\n\nYes, Ungoliant's Spawn is fair game for drawing from the encounter deck or discard pile. It's pretty much the best strategy so you don't have to deal with all the other cards in the deck, especially if you haven't come across Caught in a Web yet.\n\nMy understanding is that if a shadow card tells you to do something and you can't do it, you just move on. No harm, no foul, like you said. Now, this is different when the action is optional. For example, a location may have a travel effect that reads, \"Each player must exhaust one hero he controls to travel here.\" If all your heroes are exhausted you simply cannot travel there. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63002-new-player-dumb-questions/?do=findComment&comment=617092","commentId":617092,"userName":"Schmiegel","timestamp":1334283528,"content":" Thank you Budgernaut! And one more..\n\nThe \"Thicket of Spears\" event card states \"you must use resources from 3 different heroes' pools to pay for this card.\" That would mean that a player would need to have all 3 heroes that he controls be from the Tactics sphere, correct? That is, you couldn't have one player have one of his Tactics heroes pay a resource and have another player have two of his Tactics sphere heroes pay resources, could you? I'm under the impression that Event cards are paid for by one player, and that multiple players can't share the cost.. I'm pretty sure that's correct, but I question it now because it seems like \"Thicket of Spears\" wouldn't get played all that often, in that case.\n\nBut maybe some decks and hero parties are purposely built with that sort of thing (Tactics specialty) specifically in mind."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63002-new-player-dumb-questions/?do=findComment&comment=617212","commentId":617212,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1334311978,"content":" You're correct - you need 3 tactics heroes to use Thicket of Spears.  And you're further correct in thinking it doesn't get played that often. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63002-new-player-dumb-questions/?do=findComment&comment=617244","commentId":617244,"userName":"Budgernaut","timestamp":1334316118,"content":" Yeah, I think it mostly gets played in 3-4 player games when each player is using a different sphere.

Interestingly, I have tried most of what you suggested, presuming I'm lucky enough to get those cards (Forest Snare, Feint, Northern Tracker). As far as the monosphere tactics and monosphere spirit, I haven't tried that. \n\nAs I understand it, after the \"First Game\" (according to the rules as I interpret them..) players are supposed to be building decks via the tournament/customization mode, with a minimum of 50 cards per deck. I'm not seeing any rules other than those two options for the number of cards that are supposed to comprise a deck. I don't think I missed anything, but who knows. I only own the core set, so I only have 29 cards of the tactics and spirit type. That would seem to preclude me from trying any monosphere strategy, at least until I purchase another adventure pack or expansion and get more cards.\n\nIs this correct? This could be the essence of my problem. Maybe I am not interpreting the minimum number of cards in the deck rule correctly...\n\nI got to the point of defeating the first quest with regularity, but seem to be regressing lately in the Anduin quest, to the point of absurdity.

You can usually mitigate the amount of threat by engaging enemies and traveling to locations, but sometimes you just get overwhelmed. Cards that can generate more willpower (e.g. Faramir) or place additional progress tokens (Northern Tracker, Lorien Guide) may help you deal with a glut of locations.
