Since I started my website, Tabletop Geeks [http://tabletopgeeks.com], I have been putting everything I find onto a page so that I not only have it saved but so that other people can benefit from my collection as well (example: Malifaux Downloads [http://tabletopgeeks.com/malifaux-downloads/] page). Now that I'm really getting into these Living Card Games I'd like to put up a page like this for LCGs as well.\n\n\nSo, I ask that you guys post any resources that you know of for LotR LCG here so that I can compile them all into one location. I am looking for any documents/pdfs/web resources/whatever that you find useful. Once I get a good list of stuff I'll put up a page with all the links in one location."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52157-compilation-of-resources-available-now/?do=findComment&comment=520156","commentId":520156,"userName":"HilariousPete","timestamp":1314330726,"content":"There is a rule summary on www.headlesshollow.com/downloads/games/LordoftheRingsLCG_v1.pdf [http://www.headlesshollow.com/downloads/games/LordoftheRingsLCG_v1.pdf] with a printable turn sequence overview.\n\nI made a Strange Eons plugin with which you can create your own encounter cards, on www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html [http://www.4shared.com/file/_VH6sOk6/LotR.html] The Strange Eons program is required for it.
