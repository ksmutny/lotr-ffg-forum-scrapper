It had an add for Foundations of Stone featuring a really cool piece of artwork with an Aragorn like figure who was holding a glowing sword and peering around a corner. It also had some cards on there. One was the Nameless Fear.\n\nAnother was a treachery card titled Lost and Alone which had a great picture of a hobbit crouching in the dark and had an effect that had something to do with shuffling a HERO into your deck and then I assume you could put them back into play when you drew the card. Pretty crazy!\n\nThe last card was a partially obscured Tactics event. I saw half of the picture which seemed to be a dwarf putting the beat-down on an orc's face. I couldn't see all the text but it seemed to have something to do with if you deal X damage to an enemy, play the card and double that amount of damage. It might be for dwarves. All the art was really great!\n\nThat eased the pain of my LFGS NOT having Road to Rivendell... a bit.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62506-foundations-of-stone-known-cards/?do=findComment&comment=612029","commentId":612029,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1333167257,"content":"I've never been one for spoilers in the past, but with the Dwarrowdelf cycle I just can't seem to help myself!
