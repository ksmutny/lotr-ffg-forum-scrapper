In the grander scheme of things it is usually worthwhile but having him limited to 1 phase only (albeit any phase you´re in real trouble) and say that you get the excact same for 4 cheaper isn´t true. (remember there are effects to unexhaust allies and word of command can be a great boon as your last action)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131506-question-about-sneak-attackand-other-cards-like-it/?do=findComment&comment=1403570","commentId":1403570,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1421103531,"content":"yes, this is true, but you also get him back into your hand (if he doesn't die) which can be great if your struggling with threat.\n\nanyway, it is beside the point.  sneak attack is a great card mostly because of its power together with gandalf."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131506-question-about-sneak-attackand-other-cards-like-it/?do=findComment&comment=1403589","commentId":1403589,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1421104644,"content":"I almost never see Sneak Attack used with anyone besides Gandalf.  I've maybe used Descendant of Thorondor once (4 direct damage), and I used the Boromir ally once (defended 2 attacks and attacked for 3)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131506-question-about-sneak-attackand-other-cards-like-it/?do=findComment&comment=1403596","commentId":1403596,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1421105088,"content":"Though one shouldn´t underestimate the power (of the dark side) of having the opportunity to play even a weak ally for cannon fodder, when the solution you thought you had figured out is suddenly thwarted."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131506-question-about-sneak-attackand-other-cards-like-it/?do=findComment&comment=1405062","commentId":1405062,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1421183065,"content":"Using beorn (the ally) is also not a bad idea.  I also used fili (in lake town) partly to get 5 dwarves in my dwarf deck and also for chumping against smaug.  but your right.  "}]}
