And I don't think it was a spontainous decision, yet they give one of two existing Silvan heroes ability that has nothing to do with Silvan trait at all. More of it, other Silvan elf is tactics hero, and an upcoming one is of the leadership, meaning that her usefulness in the Silvan hero deck is -1 starting threat. \n\n \n\nMy question is... WHY? Why on earth her text is not: \"Each hero you control with a Silvan trait or a printed Lore resource icon gets -1 threat cost.\"?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99871-major-design-flaw-from-my-point-of-view/?do=findComment&comment=992739","commentId":992739,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1393107840,"content":"because forcing tribes suck and there is enough of that in the game already."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99871-major-design-flaw-from-my-point-of-view/?do=findComment&comment=992741","commentId":992741,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1393107920,"content":"Running her in a silvan deck would work fine, with two attack, and maybe there will be more Lore Silvan heroes.
