Which happens first, is the player (and all his cards) eliminated from the game, or do the cards get placed into the discard pile first? I think that with the rules saying that the eliminated players cards go into his discard pile, would imply that in fact the player is already  eliminated from the game before the cards are discarded. This is why I leave it question marked, because this all depends on the opinion of whether eliminated players cards are in fact leaving play, which is why I made the Glorfindel comparison in the first place. I might be inclined to think that in the Glorfindel case you would actually place a token. But on the safe side until the FAQ comes out with an update, I always play as though the answer is no."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59833-horn-of-gondor-and-eliminated-players/?do=findComment&comment=589107","commentId":589107,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1328210307,"content":"Bonus Card said:\n\nI always play as though the answer is no.\n\n \n\nThe answer is yes.. the card reads\n\nmed_horn-of-gondor-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_horn-of-gondor-core.jpg]\n\n\"Response: After a character leaves play, add 1 resource to attached hero's pool.\"\n\nThere are allies and heroes.. but they are both CHARACTERS.
