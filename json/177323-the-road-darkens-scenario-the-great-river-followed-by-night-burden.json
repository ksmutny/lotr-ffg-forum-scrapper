Why not process the \"when revealed\"? In general, no nothing says not to do so. Also, the quest reads: \"cannot engage\", but Followed by Nights reads: \"put in play (allready) engaged with player\". So even if the engaging is preventet by the mission, the when revealed says nothing about engaging, but engaged! I there is a difference, as far as I interprete the wordings."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177323-the-road-darkens-scenario-the-great-river-followed-by-night-burden/?do=findComment&comment=1630636","commentId":1630636,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1432207553,"content":"Enemies put into play engaged with a player counts as engaging them.\n\nAs per the Samwise Gamgee ruling a while back, which states that his ability will trigger off that method of engagement."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177323-the-road-darkens-scenario-the-great-river-followed-by-night-burden/?do=findComment&comment=1630746","commentId":1630746,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1432214515,"content":"> Enemies put into play engaged with a player counts as engaging them.\n> \n> As per the Samwise Gamgee ruling a while back, which states that his ability will trigger off that method of engagement.\n\n \n\nWhere is this ruling?

A: Yes. An enemy that enters play directly engaged with a player has engaged that player.\"\n\n \n\nSo for this topic, because putting an enemy into play engaged with you counts as \"engaging\" that enemy, and in this instance enemies cannot be \"engaged,\" you will not have any enemies engaged with you after resolving Followed by Night... the attempt to put the enemy into play will fail, and it will stay in its place in the discard pile."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177323-the-road-darkens-scenario-the-great-river-followed-by-night-burden/?do=findComment&comment=1631919","commentId":1631919,"userName":"Flrbb","timestamp":1432271725,"content":"I guess, I played this part wrong then.\n\nAnd it brings some missions to a new level (for me) then - at least with Mabulung :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]: there are some quests where the big boss enemy stays in the staging area but counts as engaged with the (new) first player each round. technically that is then also engaging."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177323-the-road-darkens-scenario-the-great-river-followed-by-night-burden/?do=findComment&comment=1631982","commentId":1631982,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1432278403,"content":"Sorry Flrbb, but in the same FAQ they also ruled that there is a distinction between \"considered engaged\" and actually engaged.
