Welcome!\n\nI played several four-player games with a single core set. It was very, very fun to play it that way. There are plenty of tokens in the core set and all we had to do was keep track of threat for the other two players with a pen and paper. I highly recommend the multiplayer version. Since the holidays are over and the extended family members aren't around, I've been forced to play solo. It can be a frustrating experience, but very rewarding when you do it right.\n\nBy the way, nice avatar!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60155-new-player-here/?do=findComment&comment=591408","commentId":591408,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1328647348,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n1.i would recommend getting a few mirkwood cycle packs before khazad- its quite difficult to begin with and you may want some plays and some key cards to begin with......apart from that it all depends.....are you a theme guy? do you like to go through a storyline? or are you interested in the packs for their player cards? do you like very hard quests? also do you like combat? or travelling and questing?\n\nI don't mind hard quests, but  I like to win once in awhile.  My success rate is abysmally low with the solo game so far!  When I build a deck I think it would be cool to go with a race or nation theme, but I kind of want to stick to one sphere since I am having trouble with resource management as it is.  I am a fairly casual player but I also like function, so I will probably look around and see which nation has cards that I like before deciding how to build.\n\nRight now I am primarily interested in the adventure packs for more player cards.  The core set is new for me so I am still having fun with those quests, I'd just like to add some cards to the repertoire to flesh out a single sphere some.  I've really enjoyed the Lore sphere (but I haven't won with it yet!

Obviously, you only get 1 Gandalf each, and have no deck-building options to speak of- there isn't even a choice of heroes - but that's probably not going to make a big difference, particularly if you're just introducing the game to people, trying to figure out how big a group you've got that like it. As you said, you'll need to keep track of threat with pen & paper.\n\nWith a single Core set, you can also deck-build upto a point for less than 4 players, by combining spheres. Biggest drawback, is the lack of ways to give heroes different resource icons- Celebrian's Stone on Aragorn is your only option.\n\nLooking at the Mirkwood cycle each pack will give you 3x copies of 2 new cards per sphere for the player decks, 1 hero, and 3x of a neutral card - in four of the 6 packs, these are \"songs\" which you can use to give a hero another resources icon, and allow them to pay for cards from a  different sphere. The rest of the cards are a new quest.\n\nIf you like the game and are going to play it regularly, then go for some adventure packs- there are some really good cards, including some nice themes - eagles for Tactics, Rohan for Spirit, and the new quests make a change from just trudging back and forth through Mirkwood.\n\nIf you think you'll play a lot with 3 or 4 players, I'd recommend a 2nd core set as well. It'll give you second copies of some of the really good cards, and allow you to deckbuild much sooner (if you want 4 single-sphere 50 card decks with only 1 core set, you'd basically need all the Mirkwood cycle, and still not have any real choices to make)\n\nDon't even bother thinking about a 3rd Core set until you own every other expansion there is AND have a lot of spare cash- you only get about 12 usable cards (i.e. 3rd copies of the 1x cards)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60155-new-player-here/?do=findComment&comment=591526","commentId":591526,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1328678329,"content":"GrandSpleen said:\n\nrichsabre said:\n\n1.i would recommend getting a few mirkwood cycle packs before khazad- its quite difficult to begin with and you may want some plays and some key cards to begin with......apart from that it all depends.....are you a theme guy? do you like to go through a storyline? or are you interested in the packs for their player cards? do you like very hard quests? also do you like combat? or travelling and questing?\n\n \n\nI don't mind hard quests, but  I like to win once in awhile.  My success rate is abysmally low with the solo game so far!  When I build a deck I think it would be cool to go with a race or nation theme, but I kind of want to stick to one sphere since I am having trouble with resource management as it is.  I am a fairly casual player but I also like function, so I will probably look around and see which nation has cards that I like before deciding how to build.\n\nRight now I am primarily interested in the adventure packs for more player cards.  The core set is new for me so I am still having fun with those quests, I'd just like to add some cards to the repertoire to flesh out a single sphere some.  I've really enjoyed the Lore sphere (but I haven't won with it yet!
