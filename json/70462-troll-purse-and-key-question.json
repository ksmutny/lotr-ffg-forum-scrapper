Per the FAQ (p.7), Banks of the Anduin does not return to the top of the encounter deck when discarded as a shadow card. This is due to the fact that, \"[w]hen a card is drawn as a Shadow card, only its Shadow text is active.\" \n\nIf we apply the same principle to the Troll objectives, only their (nonexistent) Shadow text will be active when they are revealed as Shadow cards. As a result, they won't return to play.\n\nThat being said, FFG has already issued one clarification pertaining to these objectives, so more may be forthcoming."}]}
