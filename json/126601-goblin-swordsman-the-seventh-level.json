Therefore he won't be able to attack until next round, but I can attack him as a target in the staging area (Dunhere)?\n\n \n\nMany thanks on helping me resolve this one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126601-goblin-swordsman-the-seventh-level/?do=findComment&comment=1325813","commentId":1325813,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1415373378,"content":"You are correct."}]}
