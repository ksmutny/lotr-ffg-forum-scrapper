An inside joke? Or is Thorongil shorthand for some card?\n\n \n\nAnyway, I find it odd that Helm of Secrecy says to discard all tokens from it, which I would take to include damage tokens. But then the last line says to move damage token over, so apparently those are not to be removed. Odd phrasing, unless I'm missing something.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308855-helm-of-secrecy/?do=findComment&comment=3951967","commentId":3951967,"userName":"Halberto","timestamp":1592245388,"content":"> 2 hours ago, JYoder said:\n> \n> I'm not understanding this.

Essentially you get the same benefit of changing hero version plus the additional benefit of saving 1 resource AND maintaining the hero sphere and abilities. \n\n \n\nOf course with the helm you can change the hero to a different one,not only to a different version,  so the effect of the helm is much broader in terms of deckbuilding options and strategy."}]}
