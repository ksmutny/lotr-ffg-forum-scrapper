I've searched for it, but can't find anything. My question is: When do all of Collateral Damage's effects happen? More specifically, the card says this: \"When Revealed: Discard 2 cards from the top of the encounter deck. Discard an additional 2 cards for each copy of Collateral Damage in the discard pile. ...\"  So if I discarded another copy of Collateral Damage from the encounter deck with the initial 2 discarded cards, does that mean I have to discard 2 more for the copy just discarded? Or does the \"Discard an additional 2 cards from the encounter deck for each copy of CD in the discard pile\" effect happen immediately, at the same time as the initial 2 discarded cards, negating any other CDs discarded from having any effect? \n\n \n\nHaha. Sorry if that sounds really unclear. If it doesn't make sense, just tell me and I'll try to make it more comprehensible. Thanks for all your help!\n\nEdited July 17, 2013 by legolas18"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86498-collateral-damage-peril-in-pelargir/?do=findComment&comment=815923","commentId":815923,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374058464,"content":"i see your question. here's my view-\n\nthe 'when revealed' effect happens immediatly and says 'discard 2 extra etc...in the discard pile'\n\n \n\nso im guessing here you are meant to check through the discard pile, count them, then work out how many.\n\nno extra gets added by what you discard through the effect\n\nthats how i play it\n\ninteresting question\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86498-collateral-damage-peril-in-pelargir/?do=findComment&comment=816558","commentId":816558,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1374125141,"content":"Okay.

Discard an additional 2 cards for each copy of Collateral Damage in the discard pile. Then, raise each player's threat by 2 for each location discarded by this effect.\n\n \n\nI couldn't really read your post.. it didn't make a lot of sense.. but I can tell you how the card works.\n\n \n\nWhen you read card text ordering matters. The reveled effect isn't all happening at a single moment, it just starts and then fully resolves before any new effect. The card text in fact happens in the order you read the card. There is a specific reason why there is a full stop. Think of them as phases...\n\n \n\nWords like \"and\" \"when\" \"then\" etc etc have great meaning in card games.\n\n \n\nSo..\n\n 1. The card is revealed\n 2. Discard 2 Cards (Full stop end of a card resolution phase)\n 3. Look in discard pile, then discard 2 more cards for each copies of Collateral Damage in the discard (Full stop end of a card resolution phase)\n 4. Then raise threat by 2 for each location discarded.\n\nShort: YES. You discard more cards if you discard Collateral Damage cards in phase 1\n\n \n\nLong Version: If you discard any Collateral Damage cards in phase 1.. then you include them then working out if you need to discard any extra cards. As the \"discard extra cards stuff\" occurs AFTER you have discarded in the next phase of the card. So the Collateral Damage cards are in the discard pile when you go to resolve phase 2.  BUT... as that \"action\" is in phase 2 .. any MORE Collateral Damage cards that are discarded in phase 2 DO NOT require you to discard more cards as the \"discard extra cards stuff\" has already triggered and resolved.\n\n \n\nIt is also worth noting that the trigger card itself (the one you originally reveled form the deck) dose not go in the yard until it is fully resolved. So it dose nto count itself in phase 2. When the entire card has resolved, that is when it goes into the yard.\n\nEdited July 19, 2013 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86498-collateral-damage-peril-in-pelargir/?do=findComment&comment=817681","commentId":817681,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1374256964,"content":"Hmm.

So for one part ot resolve the 1st must.. it is like a forced response inside the card text. So \"blah blah blah then blam blam blam\" means that blah blah blah HAS to occur before blam blam blam. if Blah blah blah fizzles then as it has not occurred the \"then\" text can not activate. Think of it as linking a forced response between the two parts fo the sentence.\n\n \n\nExample: Drop and smash a plate THEN sweep up the shards.\n\n \n\nIf you never drop the plate, then you can not sweep up the shared. So... if the first effect of the sentence fizzles and dose not occur, any THEN text afterwards would also fissile. If it was AND then it wouldn't be like this, each would resolve.. but to save card text room they just put a full stop.\n\n \n\nSo there is no THEN in the card text as it is using fullstops to separate the effects as unrelated sections of the card resolution.\n\nEdited July 20, 2013 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86498-collateral-damage-peril-in-pelargir/?do=findComment&comment=818633","commentId":818633,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1374441686,"content":"> You´re right, there isn´t a \"then\" in the card text.
