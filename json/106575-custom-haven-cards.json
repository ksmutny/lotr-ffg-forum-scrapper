I think one of the main reasons we play an ally is to either attack or chump block, and forbidding them to do that seems a good enough restriction. Not to say they are also forbidden to quest. I'd still like these allies to only be able to use their special abilities.\n\nEdited May 19, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1089584","commentId":1089584,"userName":"Kerstoid","timestamp":1400462015,"content":"Beautiful cards and an idea that could work with a little playtesting for balance!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1089606","commentId":1089606,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1400464032,"content":"New ideas for future Havens: Lothlórien, Rivendell, Hobbiton, Bree, Pelargir, Dol Amroth, Esgaroth, Dale, Helm's Deep.

There are very few allies I think that are obvious \"Haven\" allies (stargazer comes to mind but even she can chump block in a pinch), since most of them will have at least one stat that can be used, so there are many strategic choices to be made. Do I send Erestor with the heroes and have a good quested and decent defender or do I keep him safely in the Haven so he can draw cards? Now of course there are many decks that simply do not have allies with actions that you can take advantage of if played in the Haven, and that's why I decided to put special abilities on the Havens themselves so there's more of an advantage to playing allies there.\n\n \n\nI like your idea of a negative effect for every time you trigger an ally's ability in a Haven. Maybe a threat increase? \n\n \n\nNow that I think of it, I'm not sure I can make five more dual-sphere Havens PLUS four mono-sphere havens. There are just not enough good locations in Middle Earth!

Erebor was the only one that worked perfectly, a perferct balance between cost and benefit. The other Havens, though, were actually not really good at all. Their effects were not totally worth it, especially in the beggining, playing an ally in the Haven can actually be very crippling, even my Mono-leadership gondor deck struggled if I played an ally in Minas Tirith early on, and when its text became active, it was not useful at all since Gondor allies are all so wimpy anyway... it was just that their ffect was so minimal that it was just not worth it to play a cheap chumpblocker in the Haven to get it.. So I came with new abilities for some of them (Dunharrow, Minas Tirith, Edoras, Dol Amroth) and made the effects more interesting.\n\n \n\nNew versions:\n\n \n\nMinas Tirith\n\nlimit of 4, A player must control at least 2 gondor heroes to control this haven. Restricted to Gondor allies. While each of your heroes has at least 1 resource in its resource pool, Minas Tirith gains \"Action: exhaust 2 allies played here to choose a player. Each Gondor character controlled by that player gets +1 attack until the end of the phase (limit twice per round)\"\n\n \n\nEdoras\n\nLimit 4, A player must control at least 2 Rohan heroes to control this Haven. Restricted to Rohan allies. Response: after a character leaves play, you may exhaust 3 allies played here to look at the rop 4 chards of your deck. Add 2 of theose ards to your hand and discard the others.\n\n \n\nDol Amroth\n\n \n\nLimit 3, A player must control a Leadership and a Tactics hero to control this Haven. Leadership and Tactics heroes you control get +1 defense for each ally played here with a printed cost higher than 1 (to a limit of +2).\n\n \n\nDunharrow\n\n \n\nLimit 3. A player must control a Spirit and a Tactics hero to control this Haven. Restricted to Spirit and Tactics allies. Response: After the players quest successfully, you may exhaust 2 allies played here to deal 2 damage to an enemy in the staging area.\n\n \n\n \n\nOkay, so you can see that basically there Havens got a pretty big buff. They did. The ability of Dunharrow, for example, was a joke. It required an active location that had to be cleared, and an enemy in the staging area, which, if you already were high enough in threat, could be only one that had been just revealed from the encounter deck. And all the while I had spent a few valuable resources on allie that were ust going to be waiting there to be exhausted and it just never happened. Now it actually works, and without being overpowered. Same for Edoras. The effect was just never triggered and if it did, it was pretty insignificant. Now I have made the cost higher, but the potential benefit is higher as well. What do you think of the changes?\n\n \n\nAlso playtested Bree, and that one works just perfectly.\n\nEdited May 23, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1384645","commentId":1384645,"userName":"dragoncymru","timestamp":1419868054,"content":"I think the idea of these is absolutely brilliant!\n\n \n\nAre you thinking of continuing with the idea and tweaking what you have?

You have 1 Haven at the start of the game.\n\n2. What Haven you have is independent of the quest but rather thematic of what heroes you have? Kind of 'where you come from'?\n\n3. Havens give a bonus to play in some way. So if you play one, for balance, there must be a cost? A small threat cost would be obvious (say 1-3?) balance? Havens could reduce costs of Allies played there? Butterbur at Bree for example? Beorn and beornings  could play cheaper if Beorn's House is your Haven? Radagast at Rhosgobel?\n\n4. You can play allies at Havens. If an Ally is at a Haven what does this mean? They cannot be attacked or defend? Can they Quest? Questing kind of makes sense as it can be Erestor's advice for example. But an Ally at a Haven is no affected by Treachery cards revealed I the Quest phase? Can Allies leave Havens to join you on the Quest (perhaps you have to pay 1 Resource to move them from haven to your party??) Allies at havens can still use abilities though?\n\n \n\nis this about it?."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1386359","commentId":1386359,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1419963079,"content":"1: Yes\n\n2: Yeah, kinda. It goes with your deck while not being part of it, like heroes, and represents where you come from. But it doesn't need to be thematic. If you're playing with Elladan and Elrohir but your deck works best if using Dol Amroth as a haven, then use it.\n\n3: I think that losing the bodies on the table is enough of a drawback. The thing with havens is that you have to be very careful of when to play allies with your company or in the haven. You have to measure the cost and benefit of having the bonus later on if you can afford it or trying to reach it early if you need it. They are kinda like planeswalkers, in a way.\n\n4: Allies in a haven cannot quest, attack or defend. They can, however, use their special abilities. Since the encounter cards and decks do not consider havens and characters played at them, they are considered non-existent, or out of play, by treachery cards, archery effects and the like, so that the rest of the game stays pretty much intact.  \n\n \n\nI haven't thought of the possibility of allies leaving the haven to join you on the quest. That is interesting, and I could make a rule out of it, though I'd prefer if it was a neutral event that let you do that.\n\n \n\nAnother thing I haven't decided yet is whether allies played at havens are immune to play card effects or not. They can of course affect the game with their abilities, but I don't know if it is balanced or thematic if a ranger at Henneth Annun can shoot arrows at the staging area in Rohan, or throw rocks at enemies and such.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nAlso, suggestions for Helm's Deep?
