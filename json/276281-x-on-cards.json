Most of the time it is define on the cards (usually \"X is egal to the number of players\"). When﻿ nothing define the X you can choose any X.\n\nThe rest is good, but the boldfaced part is untrue, no? Like when you Vilya a Stand and Fight off the top of the deck: it doesn't mean you can put into play a 6-cost Beorn in your discard pile.\n\nFAQ 1.40: 'Unless specified by a card effect, or granted player choice, the letter \"X\" is equal to 0.'\n\nEDIT: The RR has a new additional clause: 'For costs involving the letter X, the value of X is defined by card ability or player choice, after which the amount paid may be modified by effects without altering the functional value of X.'\n\nSo what @Rouxxor [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/308704-rouxxor/] said is a little more true than I said, specifically in the X cost situation. I don't think this changes the Vilya/Stand and Fight interaction, though, as Vilya ignores costs entirely—this doesn't give you a chance to choose X at all, thus defaulting it to 0.\n\nInterestingly enough, the new RR clause also helps to cover something like Hail of Stones, which says \"Exhaust X characters to…\" Even though X is not explicitly \"granted player choice\" in the card text, the clause is a cost involving X and therefore covered by the RR addition. Good job, Caleb!\n\n \n\nEdited May 20, 2018 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276281-x-on-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3340696","commentId":3340696,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1526824439,"content":"If a card make you play a card with a X cost without paying it cost (vilya for example), this X is not paid and so is egal to 0.
