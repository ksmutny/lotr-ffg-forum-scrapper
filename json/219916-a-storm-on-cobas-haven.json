If this quest will be fun will probably be a matter of how much you have to rely onto the objectives and how consistent they Show up. The spoiled ship enemy brings an objective into Play (guarding it) so it should be a managable Task to get at least some under Control.

Combine it with tactics Aragorn to get a -2 defense Advantage on your enemies and engage as much stuff as possible, 3-5 dead enemies don't seem too unlikely (depending on Player numbers, set-up etc.).\n\n \n\nIoreth Looks like a good healer. she fills the role of a situational healer \"really\" well, as 1 ressource for 3 HP is a great deal (warden of healing Needs 3 turns to be equally efficent without elrond). Only downside are her stats (REALLY BAD) it's not that she is a 0 in every Attribute, only 1 hitpoint is so weak against many AoE treacheries (even worse if you used her before questing :S)\n\n \n\nJustice shall be done.

At this point in the game, there are so many cards that can look at the top 5+ cards to help you get the exact cards you need, that limit-one cards are becoming much more viable. I can definitely see Justice Shall Be Done being a \"win more\" card, but I can also see it helping in many quests that tend to be most difficult near the end when the \"boss\" shows up, and of course, some treacheries/shadows can absolutely wreck a deck that is pretty much all set up just as you're nearing the end. Of course, it is probably the case that most games are lost before you get close to the end, so this card may not be of much help there."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2216765","commentId":2216765,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1463179345,"content":"Calvadur, on 13 May 2016 - 6:23 PM, said:\nKnife-work should be good and give tactics important carddraw if you can activate it.

If you have a few nice combat allies out like Mithlond Sea Watcher, Marksman of Lorien, Legolas etc you could really clean up house with that extra -1 on top of Aragorn's -1 and for a few attacks with Elladan an additional -2 to enemy def and you would draw several cards at the same time. I think even with just 2 enemies killed and 2 cards drawn it is still very worth it as it isn't just drawing you the cards but also helping you destroy those enemies at the same time which is great in of itself. The 2 lore resources are a little harder to come up with or afford than the single tactics resource though but so long as you use this perhaps mid to late game it will hopefully be more affordable as well as more useful. Could be a great card for all those quests that reveal several encounter and/or enemy cards all at once when you progress to a certain quest stage. I think that includes quite a few quests to be honest!\n\nI'm going to make proxies of Knife Work and try it out soon, I'll post about my experiences!\n\nI really do think that it will be Imrahil in this pack as it is a perfect thematic choice and also continues along the trend we saw in Flight of the Stormcaller of providing us with Heroes that are also thematic for the next saga box (Denethor). By providing us with several heroes we would like to see in that saga box in this cycle instead it allows us to get so many more heroes that are thematically fitting for the next saga box by the time it comes out. I'm actually really happy and impressed they seem to be doing this as it means pretty much everyone is happy and we get all the various heroes we desire to use and or get for that saga box. Hopefully this means we do indeed see new versions of Eomer, Merry, Pippin, Elladan, Elrohir, Halbarad and Beregond!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2217131","commentId":2217131,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1463212355,"content":"I like the final breakthrough card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2217183","commentId":2217183,"userName":"Calvadur","timestamp":1463218497,"content":"> Silvan Tracker is a good point - in the right deck he is absolutely obscene.

Even though she is free, she constantly Drains ressources from you, if you use her every turn. 2nd She is unique so there can be only one.\n\nWhile healing for 3 is a strong and useful effect, there often will be situations where the damage is splashed between your allies and not stacked on 1 target so warden of healing, silvan tracker etc. would still remain highly relevant. If you have 1 spare lore ressource per turn you aren't to far of to get multiple uses of a warden of healing, it is defenetly a slower Play as the warden costs 2 by himself, but the potential numbers arre much higher. Also a Group of 2 or even 3 wardens are insane. Lastly Ioreth might be the healing Card to Profit the least from Elrond, as healing 4 poits of damage is only usefull if you have a 5 HP character who is nearly dead, while boosting a healing of 1 up to 2 is much more useful (100% increase insted of 33%).\n\n \n\nThere are only few Scenarios in which you can't place damage in a way that other healers can't compete with Ioreth.\n\n \n\nTL;DR: Ioreth with 2 Hp wouldn't be so strong that she would be the single best healer in the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2217358","commentId":2217358,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1463235033,"content":"> If you get more hit points to Ioreth, se becomes THE best healer of the game.\n\nEh I don't know...\n\n \n\nWarden of Healing when you have a bootload of lore resources and Elrond in play can heal a ****ton of damage in a single turn.\n\nI just played a round during a game of Fate of Numenor in which I used two copies of Imladris Caregiver and loads of spirit resources to abuse a single copy of Elven light into healing 2 damage four times from any character (healing more or less all damage across the board accumulated till that point including a point of damage on one of the Caregivers) and also drawing me four cards as well. Because I did this during the planing phase I was able to play 3 of those four cards I drew that same phase (UC, Sailor of Lune and Silver Harp. I was able to do this as I had crazy stacked up resources because I was forced to discard many cards early/mid game due to nasty encounter effects).\n\nThis boost was just what I needed to get that deck started back up again and churning cards out faster and helped lead to a a victory.\n\nWarden can heal more and across more characters so long as Elrond is in play or you use lore resources to get multiple uses in one turn.\n\nCaregiver is not only a very decent healer and heals an equal amount to Ioreth with Elrond in play each turn but also helps boost the Noldor discard/draw engine overall as well.\n\nHell even Silvan Tracker is still better as it heals all Silvan characters which means if you are running a dedicated Silvan deck/s you have healing across the board for free every turn and with more than one in play or Elrond boosting them they will be absolutely more than enough for the rest of the game.\n\n \n\nIoreth, with or without more hitpoints, is in my opinion not even close to as good as some of the healing options we already have ."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2217369","commentId":2217369,"userName":"webslinger9","timestamp":1463236374,"content":"So in a four player game, could you use 3 copies of Message From Elrond to give one player, 3 more copies of Justice Shall be Done?

Not bad for a 0-cost ally.\n\nIn an Outlands deck with Sword of Morthond attached, she's sick. A questing machine for just 1 resource, since healing is situational and one might not use her each turn for her effect. Warden might be better in the long game for healing purposes, but his healing modus operandi probably necessitates usage more often than Ioreth, ergo he's a worst candidate for the Sword than her. Plus, in an Outlands deck the 2 resources he costs to enter play are important, since he has to fight with the Herdsman, the Hunter and, if picked in deck-building, Gleowine, as to who will hit the table. Hirluin may pay for the first two of course, though wouldn't it be better if one had the opportunity to play a non-Lore Outlands ally, a Lore Outlands ally/Gleowine AND a healer in the same turn?\n\nAs for her art, it's one of the masterpieces in this game.\n\nIt's official: Ioreth is a GILF.\n\nEdited May 15, 2016 by Serazu"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2218577","commentId":2218577,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1463337064,"content":"> It's official: Ioreth is a GILF.\n\n \n\nI'm out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2220590","commentId":2220590,"userName":"Estel Edain","timestamp":1463445837,"content":"The spoiled cards look fun, and I'm looking forward to a major ship battle.\n\n \n\nThe Linhir Sea-captain, together with the second quest in Flame of the West, makes me think that at some point we'll get Angbor the fearless, lord of Lamedon, When the Grey Company and the Army of the Dead approached Linhir, all the Corsairs and Gondorians fled, except for Angbor. He gathered an army that marched to Minas Tirith, arriving shortly after Aragorn left for the Black Gate, and saw to the defense of the city.\n\n \n\nI love the effect and especially the flavour text on Justice Shall Be Done, but I'm not a fan of the card name. It sounds triumphalist (and perhaps the art supports that interpretation), and its certainty (\"Shall\") doesn't fit with Tolkien's theme of eucatastrophe in the darkest moment. Listen to what Gandalf says at the last debate, shortly before the flavour text:\n\n \n\n> His Eye is now straining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. So we must keep it. Therein lies all our hope. This, then, is my counsel. We have not the Ring. In wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed, lest it destroy us. Without it we cannot by force defeat his force. But we must at all costs keep his Eye from his true peril. We cannot achieve victory by arms, but by arms we can give the Ring-bearer his only chance, frail though it be.\n>  \n> As Aragorn has begun, so we must go on. We must push Sauron to his last throw. We must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his land. We must march out to meet him at once. We must make ourselves the bait, though his jaws should close on us. \n> ... \n> We must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope for ourselves. For, my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if Barad-dûr be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age.

A guaranteed 3 damage healed every round (+ a last ditch undefended attack) seems like not a horrible deal for 2 cards and 4 resources, especially since if you didn't need the healing you just bank her lore income.\n\n \n\nI hadn't thought of this. Treebeard decks will get a huge boost. In a solo deck with Glorfindel and Elrond, you could use Stargazer to play Sword-thain with Vilya on Ioreth. At that point she lets Treebeard quest or attack to his full potential basically for free.\n\nEdited May 17, 2016 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2220858","commentId":2220858,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1463470202,"content":"Estel, I like your take on JSBD, you seem well-versed in the Lore."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/219916-a-storm-on-cobas-haven/?do=findComment&comment=2221344","commentId":2221344,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1463493421,"content":"Dat new healer...

I know we got a super-chump Squire, and a 0-cost Hunter; however, here we have a 0-cost ally with an actual powerful ability (albeit for a cost)."}]}
