Then, make West Gate the active location. Shuffle the encounter deck.\"\n\nSo the guy says \"That's an action, I don't have to do that\".  So he doesn't, and ends up getting a quick win as he quickly gets West Gate explored.\n\nIs that true?  He doesn't have to add another Osgiliath location?  Or is this a mistake?  It seems to me, given the circumstances of this scenario, if you didn't HAVE to get out another Osgiliath location, why would you ever do it?  I'm guessing the guy is mistaken, and that the action is triggered by there being no active location, and you have to search the deck for another Osgiliath location.\n\nAm I right or is he?\n\nHere's the link to the video, by the way.  Looks like he could use more views  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=676xl6qPum0 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=676xl6qPum0]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/304024-action-question-west-gate-assault-on-osgiliath/?do=findComment&comment=3861448","commentId":3861448,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1578084975,"content":"That quest is kind of broken in solo play.

However, you can use the action outside the travel phase - more specifically before quest resolution on the first turn in order to explore it faster.
