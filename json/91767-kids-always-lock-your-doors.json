I had recently bought Black Riders, and played with it ONCE, in addition to a ton of other expansions and adventure packs I had bought before (and sleeves). I am in a financial situation where I can't just go out and replace everything, so it's particularly painful. So please, learn from my mistake and lock your doors. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91767-kids-always-lock-your-doors/?do=findComment&comment=884698","commentId":884698,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1381272080,"content":"Oh man, that totally sucks. Many years ago I had a (very expensive) Magic deck stolen, including cards I had borrowed from a friend. I know how awful this feels and you have my sympathy. If you email me at HallOfBeorn@gmail.com, I can help you out with a new copy of The Black Riders (I'm assuming that you are in the US, otherwise the logistics will be a bit trickier). Just know that not everyone in this world is evil."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91767-kids-always-lock-your-doors/?do=findComment&comment=884820","commentId":884820,"userName":"Djenni","timestamp":1381282704,"content":"I'm so sorry for you man, that's awful.
