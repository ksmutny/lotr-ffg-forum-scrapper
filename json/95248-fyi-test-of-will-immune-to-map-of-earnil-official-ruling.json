Since Response effects all respond to some kind of trigger, and Actions cannot interrupt those effects, it is impossible to use the Map or Earnil (and other similar cards) to play a Response from your discard pile.\n\nCheers,\n\nCaleb\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95248-fyi-test-of-will-immune-to-map-of-earnil-official-ruling/?do=findComment&comment=931895","commentId":931895,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1387207229,"content":"hmmm you dont need prove to white is white and black is black.
