Play tested them last night and we finished JdtA with a final score of 54, and had virtually no trouble dealing with 2 Hill Trolls.\n\nSpirit/Leadership (aka, Aragorn is a beast) - 51 cards\n\nHeroes: Aragorn, Eowyn, Eleanor\n\n3x Unexpected Courage\n3x Celebrian's Stone\n3x Steward of Gondor\n3x A Test of Will\n3x The Galadhrim's Greeting\n3x Lorien Guide\n3x Ever Vigilant\n3x Dwarven Tomb\n3x Hasty Stroke\n3x Snowbourn Scout\n3x A Light in the Dark\n3x Gandalf\n3x Strength of Will\n3x Sneak Attack\n3x Common Cause\n3x Will of the West\n3x Northern Tracker\n\nTactics/Leadership (aka, Legolas's got this) - 51 cards\n\nHeroes: Legolas, Gimli, Theodred\n\n3x Guard of the Citadel\n3x Longbeard Orc  Slayer\n3x Silverlode Archer\n3x Horseback Archer\n3x Quick Strike\n3x Dwarven Axe\n3x Citadel Plate\n3x Horn of Gondor\n3x Blade of Gondolin\n3x Gondorian Spearman\n3x Swift Strike\n3x Sneak Attack\n3x Feint\n3x Valiant Sacrifice\n3x Steward of Gondor\n3x Beorn\n3x Gandalf\n\nBasically, the point of the S/L deck is pure questing with splashes of threat and enemy control. The T/L is just raw brutality. Some of these cards are sort of... filler for now (Sneak Attack in S/L, Guard of the Citadel in T/L, etc.). I welcome any feedback, but please keep in mind that these decks are meant to be played together and never separately happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46616-ill-quest-you-kill-spiritleadership-and-tacticsleadership-2-player-decks/?do=findComment&comment=466669","commentId":466669,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1305101639,"content":"I got the same Idea, but I never realised 2 decks that are meant to be played together without any lore-cards for the healing power ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nOnly one of the two players is able to play Steward of Gondor, it's a unique card.

There's a lot of wound mitigation in the Spirit/Leadership deck if you look at the card list ;-)\n\nAnd yes, we've considered replacing the Steward of Gondor in the Tactics/Leadership deck, but we're not sure what we'd replace it with actually. Maybe some Snowborn Scouts? Also, I've been thinking of replacing Sneak Attack in the Spirit/Leadership deck with whatever card readies all characters in play, I forget what it's called but it costs 5 Leadership. The SoG makes it trivial to get that many resources, actually."}]}
