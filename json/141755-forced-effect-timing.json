If I have two copies of a card that both tell me to reveal an extra card at the beginning of the encounter phase if there are less than 2 enemies in the staging area and have two enemies in the staging area after I resolve the first copy, do I still reveal another for the second copy because \"at the beginning\" of the phase I had 0 enemies? Or do the enemies that were revealed count for the second copy?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/141755-forced-effect-timing/?do=findComment&comment=1521041","commentId":1521041,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1427943501,"content":"I think the trigger is simultaneous. Â You have to resolve the effects one by one, but the trigger for each of them (\"at the beginning of the encounter phase\") was the same, so I would resolve both of those effects, regardless of how many enemies were in the staging area after resolving the first card's effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/141755-forced-effect-timing/?do=findComment&comment=1521707","commentId":1521707,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1427949424,"content":"I thought so, that's how I played it too. Just felt like if you really read the card, that's what it said to do. Needless to say that playthrough didn't go well, lol. Thanks."}]}
