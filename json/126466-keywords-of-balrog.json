Phrases like “Immune to player card effects” and “cannot have attachments” are game text - not keywords. It’s actually easy to identify keywords because they’re always called out in the rules as being keywords. I believe the confusion here is because I made it plural on the Balrog. That was me trying to leave future design space open for future nightmare mode.\"\n\n-------------------------------"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126466-keywords-of-balrog/?do=findComment&comment=1324135","commentId":1324135,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1415245290,"content":"That kind of confirms that there will be nightmare saga.....\n\nSuper unpleased by this information.

If you dont like just not purchase no prob….\n> \n>  \n\nI dont know it just seems really wrong.... its such a long campaign and so far a lot of it is quite hard already. None of the quests are easy like Emyn Muil, a lot of the first cycle in Mirkwood, Encounter at Amon Din etc and are all fairly difficult.\n\nPlus if you run super thematic decks it is obviously a lot harder as well so the difficulty can easily be ramped up that way.\n\nAnother way is pick up more burdens than you usually would or perhaps not use boons, this would make it far far harder.\n\nI think that the Campaign is only going to get harder anyway and we will eventually be almost relying on Boons we've saved up to make certain quests doable. I can't see the battle that takes place at The Black Gate, the fight against Shelob or the Siege of Minas Tirith being easy at all, pretty sure they're gonna be balls to the wall hard.\n\n \n\nThe hobbit nightmare quests were done so very badly and cop a lot of hate on the forums. Nightmare for the LOTR campaign might be just as much of a failure.\n\nAlso the saga quests are absolutely amazing and so well done thematically. What are they going to add that they haven't already? If they add enemies and locations that the fellowship didn't actually fight or explore I think that will be really dumb as its meant to be as close to the story as possible but with a different group of heroes. Unless they just do versions of existing cards with nastier effects and different art not sure how else they could handle this without changing it from Saga mode to some crappy not at all thematic or correct Saga mode.\n\nYeah I don't know I feel like its sacred and shouldn't be touched by nightmare (especially after what happened to the Hobbit boxes) :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nBesides we now have nightmare HoN, will probably have nightmare AtS and VOI before long and still have nightmare Ring Maker Cycle and Lost Realm which will also eventually be made. Definitely no lack of nightmare quests in sight, plus we will probably get more POD scenarios that are quite difficult.\n\n \n\nOh and Glaurung you know thats nonsense, if its released I'm gonna buy it whether I like it or not. We went over this in relation to Nightmare On the Doorstep. Both of us think it will suck but both want it.\n\nEdited November 7, 2014 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126466-keywords-of-balrog/?do=findComment&comment=1336663","commentId":1336663,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1416185010,"content":"Yes you have a point I agree here.

The german translation of the paragraph ranged reads a little bit different then the english original. There we got the intention that participating in an attack is the same as declaring a ranged attack, but it is simply declaring a ranged character as attacker.\n\n \n\nis there a possbile szenario in which other player could attack The Balrog without cardeffects if The Balrog has not this limitation of declaring attacks only by the first player?

On your combat phase, you may use Ranged to declare an attack against an enemy engaged with another player. This is different than participating in an attack declared by another player. The Balrog prevents this, though. If the first player is unable or unwilling to declare his own attack (e.g. has no characters ready to declare an attack with), your Ranged characters cannot take the initiative and declare it themselves.\n\nEdit: I should clarify that by \"different than\", I mean for the purposes of the Balrog's restriction. A Ranged character declaring and resolving a ranged attack is still considered to have participated in that attack for the purposes of Response and Forced triggers, like Legolas' ability. Hope this isn't getting too confusing!\n\nFor your second point: If it did not have the restriction that only the first player may declare attacks, then yes: even though it is only engaged with player 1, players 2-4 may declare and resolve their own ranged attacks against the Balrog. An enemy that is in the staging area but still \"considered to be engaged\" with a player is an eligible target following normal combat phase rules. The staging area restriction primarily serves to maintain that enemy adding threat, but otherwise treat it as engaged for other purposes.\n\nEdited February 1, 2016 by Network57"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126466-keywords-of-balrog/?do=findComment&comment=2025928","commentId":2025928,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1454346495,"content":"I'm not sure if you can use Ranged against the Balrog at all actually.
