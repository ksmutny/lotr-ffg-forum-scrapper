Dori's response targets the damage and not Beorn, so Beorn's immunity to player card effects is not a factor in this event.\nGood question!\nCaleb\n\nThis was mentioned as a possibility in an earlier thread, and maybe you all knew this, but now I do too!

You can play attachments on locations that are immune to player card effects. If a card cannot have attachments, then it will read \"Cannot have attachments.\" However, cards that are immune to player card effects will be immune to the abilities of attachments. So you can play Power in the Earth on the Troll Cave, but it will have no effect on that location. Card like Ancient Mathom and Path of Need work differently because they don't affect the location, so their abilities will still work.\nThanks for asking,\nCaleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69653-dori-the-protector-of-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=679667","commentId":679667,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1345646076,"content":" I got one right!  :dancingbanana:"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69653-dori-the-protector-of-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=679700","commentId":679700,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1345647710,"content":"path of need just got a whole lot better…………."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69653-dori-the-protector-of-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=679709","commentId":679709,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1345648280,"content":"So if Dori works, what about Song of Mocking?\n\nI also asked about Fortune or Fate and Stand Together; still waiting for the answer.
