I think the correct answer is: depends.\n\n \n\nPlayed from your hand? Wouldn't do anything if all you have is Gandalf, since he is neutral. So my answer is the same.\n\n \n\nPlayed from the top of your deck? Gandalf just gained all four resource icons when the card was played, thus activating its ability and making all four resources available for the duration of that phase.\n\n \n\nEdit: Available as one of the options to be named, that is. You still have to pick just one.\n\nEdited October 20, 2014 by MightyRauros"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125046-good-harvest-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=1305915","commentId":1305915,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1413839390,"content":"No, Gandalf is only considered to have those resources icons while he is paying for the card.  Once you have paid for Good Harvest (or any other card) and finished playing it from your deck, he is no longer considered to have any resource icons.\n\n \n\nIf those icons lasted until the end of the phase, Gandalf would be super duper broken."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125046-good-harvest-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=1305935","commentId":1305935,"userName":"MightyRauros","timestamp":1413840063,"content":"Alright, I just conceded the point on BBG and will here as well.\n\n \n\nBut I also thought of another creative use. It's convoluted and ridiculous to waste the set up on this combo, but here it is:\n\n \n\nLongbeard Map-Maker. There are many simpler (and more recommended) ways to get Lore resources, but say you have him in play already, play A Good Harvest from the top of your deck, and shout \"Lore!\" Now you can use any of Gandalf's resources to boost the Map-Maker up. While you don't have a Lore icon in play to play additional cards, A Good Harvest has said all those neutral resources you've stockpiled (right?) can be used a Lore for this phase.\n\n \n\nEdit: Looks like the good old Stand and Fight ruling is going to invalidate this as well.

Doesn´t actually say that Gandalf has to pay anything; it is the act of playing the card that is enough to trigger his ability.\n\nThough, as you say, he looses the icons immediately so the difference in this instance is minuscule."}]}
