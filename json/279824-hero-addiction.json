( blue, card draw, ally readying, and can quest/attack/defend)  After one game however, I couldn't stop thinking how much better it would be with three less starting threat and constant reduction.\n\nMy question to all of you is:  Do you have a hero that you have a hard time not playing?

My favourite thing about it is that it boots healing from any card source not just player cards so scenarios that provide healing effects via encounter cards also get boosted.\nAn encounter card that allows you to heal up to 4 damage total but from any characters suddenly has the potential to heal up to 8 damage, an encounter side quest that allows you to heal 1 damage off each character in play once cleared suddenly lets you heal 2 damage off every character etc.\n\nThen there is Vilya.... "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279824-hero-addiction/?do=findComment&comment=3455254","commentId":3455254,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1535606327,"content":"Tactics Theoden\n\nI keep wanting to build a rohan deck with his spirit version, but I end up using tactics instead"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279824-hero-addiction/?do=findComment&comment=3455443","commentId":3455443,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1535634050,"content":"> 7 hours ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> Tactics Theoden\n> \n> I keep wanting to build a rohan deck with his spirit version, but I end up using tactics instead\n\nThat's either sarcasm or an interesting strategy choice.

Santa Theoden is pivotal to spew out all of those Rohan allies.\n\nMy rohan decks have a tendency to turn into hero Voltron decks when I'm not looking, and tend to use tactics Eowyn a lot too (Elfhelm is another hero I'm addicted to, and he lends himself to the Voltron deck as well), so it's not as weird as it sounds.\n\nActually, most of my decks tend to load up on attachments and focus less on allies. In that environment, Tactics Theoden is actually a clear choice.
