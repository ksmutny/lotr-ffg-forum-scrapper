If there are no cards attached, X is 4.\n\nThalin deals 1 damage to it, but since it currently has no cards attached to it X is 4 and it’s not killed. The Elder Nameless Thing can’t engage me since my treat is 25.\nLater in the round I exhaust Denethor to peek a top encounter card, it’s Deep Deep Dark(see below) I can’t believe my luck and immediately exhaust Imladris Stargazer and place Erebor Record Keeper at the top of my deck.\n\n\nROUND  ”2”\n\nThe reviled encounter card is Deep Deep Dark\n\nDeep Deep Dark\nType: Treachery\nEncounter Set: Foundations of Stone\nDoomed 1.

Congrats man :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI haven't tried this scenario yet but maybe you could answer a question regard it? When it engages you you take the top 3 cards from your deck and attach them to it. The x = total cost of these 3 cards. If they all have 0 cost does it have 0 hit point then? Or are 0 cost cards not attached? Also can you remove attached cards from it?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67080-thalin-killed-elder-nameless-thing-with-one-blow/?do=findComment&comment=677029","commentId":677029,"userName":"PESKPESK","timestamp":1345419728,"content":"Thanks. :-)\n\nQuestions: Yes 0. They are attached. No you can't remove attached cards.\n\nA friendly tip, ask and check in the Rules questions & answers forum. \n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_temas.asp?efid=284&efcid=4 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_temas.asp?efid=284&efcid=4]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67080-thalin-killed-elder-nameless-thing-with-one-blow/?do=findComment&comment=677580","commentId":677580,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1345476011,"content":"PESKPESK said:\n\nThanks. :-)\n\nQuestions: Yes 0. They are attached. No you can't remove attached cards.\n\nA friendly tip, ask and check in the Rules questions & answers forum. \n\nhttp://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_temas.asp?efid=284&efcid=4 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_temas.asp?efid=284&efcid=4]\n\n \n\n\n\nThanks but no thanks.
