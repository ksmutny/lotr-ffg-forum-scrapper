If the general pattern holds, then there should be 1 Spirit and 1 Tactics hero left. Who do you hope the final 2 will be? What abilities do you hope they'll have? What deck-types and themes would benefit from a new hero? \n\nIf the heroes are alternate version of existing heroes, then these are the ones I expect (and/or want) to see: \n\n 1. Spirit Aragorn\n 2. Spirit or Tactics Faramir\n 3. Tactics Glorfindel\n 4. Spirit or Tactics Sam\n\nIf any character deserves to get a hero version in every sphere, then it's Aragorn. I'd also be thrilled if we got an ally Aragorn instead.\n\nEven though Faramir has 2 hero and 2 ally versions (not counting objective cards), I'm not a huge fan of either hero version. A third hero Faramir might be excessive, but he fits well into Spirit or Tactics. I really doubt he'll get another vsersion though. \n\nLore Glorfindel has been around since the beginning, but people rarely play him. Spirit Glorfindel is powerful, but he's a polarizing hero that carries a bit of a stigma. I'd love to see a Tactics Glorfindel that shows him in all his Balrog-smiting glory. Also, Noldor could really use a Tactics hero other than Elladan. \n\nI'm still amazed that Merry and Pippin got 2 hero versions well before Frodo. Meanwhile, Sam still only has 1 (albeit amazing) hero version. I'd probably prefer if the next Sam was in Spirit, but I could totally see Tactics working as well, even though his Leadership version already fulfills that combative role. \n\n \n\nIf the last 2 heroes are new additions to the lineup, then I'd love to see Spirit Gleowine, Tactics Wilyador, or an Easterling Tactics hero. The Blue Wizards don't really seem to be an option because of licensing, but I'd be happy to have them. \n\nSo, what are your hopes and guesses for these last 2 heroes? \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303540-the-last-two-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3852587","commentId":3852587,"userName":"RogueSeventeen","timestamp":1576795042,"content":"I don't necessarily want a Spirit Aragorn, but I do want a King Elessar Title that removes all copies of Steward of Gondor from play and can only attach to Aragorn or a hero of all spheres.  Or, instead, just a generic, powerful attachment that can only go on heroes of all four spheres.  The games where I do end up with a four sphere Aragorn or other hero, I always think, man, there should be some kind of card that rewards me for this haha.\n\nEdited December 19, 2019 by RogueSeventeen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303540-the-last-two-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3852590","commentId":3852590,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1576795188,"content":"Traditionally each cycle has at least 1 ffg created hero, so I would expect that, probably the tactics one.

The 3310 part is interesting though, also the title 100 years is the blink of an eye. Are they referring to age? Aragorn is 88 in the books timeline but lives until his 200s, so perhaps it could be reflecting him in his role as king (Gondor trait?). But the 3310 is that a stat line? Because they have never deviated from keeping the same stat line, unless it perhaps is a spirit ally version? Then 0 willpower, 0 attack, 3 Defense, and 3 health would fit if done backwards. Spirit always needs more defending strong allies.\n\nOr if it's referring to his hero version which is more likely I have no idea about the numbers, unless they are going to bump his willpower and/or another stat up to 3. Really curious to see what they do with him but would love to have something that works with Arwen hero and helps Gondor out too. Perhaps exhausting him to draw the top card out of your discard pile once per round as long as it costs 1 or less? That would help their swarm while not being broken."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/303540-the-last-two-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=3855614","commentId":3855614,"userName":"stimpaksam","timestamp":1577207239,"content":"I'm curious of the overuse of the word \"break\".
