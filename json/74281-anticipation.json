They remind me of a nest of hungry birds sitting there with their mouthes open and demanding that their ever empty bellies be filled.\n\nAnd then there's the endless speculation that the game is dying because there hasn't been a spoiler in a week or three. \n\nHere are some things to consider:\n\nIn the last few years, while the economy in the USA has been struggling, this small company has been growing by a factor of 10 (maybe even by a larger factor than that).\n\nFFG games are now found on the shelves of the biggest chain stores in the USA such as Target and Walmart. Next to games by the giants of Hasbro and Milton Bradley.\n\nDespite this rapid growth, the company has not lost sight of its base. Those who have dealt with the company at GenCon or know people that work there, know that they are very well-connected with their fans. They do listen; they do care. Their interaction still has to be weighed with what is going on in their world. The boards go dead the weeks before GenCon and people are surprised? Well, that's because their getting ready for their biggest trade show of the year.\n\nFFG has also launching their new product Star Wars, which has a fan-base 100x the size of Lord of the Rings. This company still is not Hasbro or Milton Bradley and launches of this size can be an all-hands on deck situation.\n\nThis game's market is growing along with the rest of FFG. I've seen this game stocked in Barnes and Noble book store now and not just game stores. Will the adventure packs some day be available in Target next to the Magic cards and YuGiOh? Maybe.\n\nThis company is looking for creative and talented people in its fan base. They just hired someone to design this game who was doing so out of love for the game. \n\nI don't care how big your game company is, you are not going to hire a person to do a full-time babysitting of one games forum. That's just bad business. A couple of their recent job postings suggest more personnel will be coming into their website management team.\n\nHere's my approach:\n\nIf you want new content on this board, then I'd suggest you make it. That is the primary reason these boards exist, so that people like us can form a community and enjoy ourselves. When FFG decides to drop in and add something to the sandbox that they built for us to play in, I appreciate it. But I'm not going to sit around waiting for it or sent my clock to it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74281-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=723795","commentId":723795,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1352966962,"content":"i didnt suggest they hire someone- i suggested they do exactly what you say- get one of us to do it, but you forget we dont have anything left to talk about\n\nthere used to be several members regularly putting content up, including me, but there is just little point when we have over done the 'speculation' threads already, there just isnt the interest in tolkien lore, and there has been so little to talk about in several weeks. so at the moment you have the all the new threads pretty much split up into either:\n\n-I am new, what packs do i get?\n\n-How do i play x rule?\n\n-what does this deck look like?\n\n-occasionally someone like me or others will put up a tolkien related thread to keep things going\n\n \n\nno one here is doomsaying- we had that thread months ago before HON was previewed, we are just asking, nicely, for something to be thrown our way a little more regularly.\n\nwell thats my opinion anyways, but others think differently and i respect that. im a big fan of this game, and i will continue to play and buy as i have always done regardless of whether ffg post news more regularly or not at all\n\nin any case- consider these threads as giving hungry birds like us something to talk about happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]….at least it shuts us up right?\n\nrich\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74281-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=723951","commentId":723951,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1352982622,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nin any case- consider these threads as giving hungry birds like us something to talk about happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]….at least it shuts us up right?\n\nrich\n\n\n\nWell, now that you mention it ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] (just kidding)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74281-anticipation/?do=findComment&comment=724438","commentId":724438,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1353068571,"content":"Golbin King,\n\nfeeding little birds is a natural process of reproduction; comparing it to something you despise says something about your character. As for creating content, yes, this thread has created some discussion - rarely seen here lately. The reason for this thread was to show a trend; it was done by someone who has the best wishes for the future of the game (whether the reason has any bearing or not) and on the ground of hearing negative feedback from around the boards not only for the lack of preview but also (and probably more importantly) toward the incosistent wording, problems with errata, etc. Finally, you mention Star Wars having a fan-size 100 times that of the Lord of the Rings; are you trolling or just ignorant?"}]}
