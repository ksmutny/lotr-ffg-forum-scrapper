The keyword included is Dire which basically means ***SPOILER**** the threat elimination level is now 99. It makes a reference to Valour cards, which trigger at 80 instead of 40. I thought I read somewhere that the secrecy threshold moved from 20 to 40 with Dire but that was neither in the instructions, nor could I find the original source of my thought. Does anyone know if this is the case? If not, there is no sense in bringing a secrecy deck since threat reduction is basically thrown out by the keyword."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292356-dire-keyword-slight-spoiler-for-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=3650240","commentId":3650240,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1552924300,"content":"Well, if the rules don't say the secrecy threshold is raised, it probably isn't!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/292356-dire-keyword-slight-spoiler-for-mountain-of-fire/?do=findComment&comment=3669060","commentId":3669060,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1554472304,"content":"The Dire keyword doesn't do anything for Secrecy."}]}
