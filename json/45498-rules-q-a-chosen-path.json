But I would say that indeed once you enter a new stage, things that have happened before become irrelevant and don't count towards fulfilling the quest, i.e., you would have to face the Spawn all over again if you'd defeated her prior to commencing this stage of the quest.\n\nTactically, this means a bit of Spawn shepherding is called for if you encounter her before you get to stage 3. Weaken her and nullify her threat, but don't kill her before you enter the final stage. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45498-rules-q-a-chosen-path/?do=findComment&comment=456381","commentId":456381,"userName":"apelite","timestamp":1303291931,"content":"Yeah, we effectively did do some shepherding, although not intentionally. But, the card says we must find her, and she was already on the board, so we didn't 'find' her during that stage of the quest.\n\nThe problem I have with interpreting this as we needing to (kill her and) find her again is that the quest card gives the opportunity to look through the deck and find her card. But of course, if she's on board, then we can't do that either. So having her on board when the quest changes is the worst possible (and largely unmittigatable) situation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45498-rules-q-a-chosen-path/?do=findComment&comment=456439","commentId":456439,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1303297101,"content":"I've always thought that it would help to be a lawyer to understand some of the interactions in card games. I can see the sense in considering her found if she's already out there, but  prior experience with other games has shown that some cards are interpreted sooooooo literally. I would not be surprised if the condition was fulfilled only by \"finding\" her then and there. Seems like, early on, this game has a few loose ends to tie. Normal, I suppose. I can only imagine that I might have a few issues of my own when I my own one arrives.

It is not (yet) as keyword driven as other games and thus I sometimes quite freely interprete the cards in the way it makes most sense and it is most fun for me as a player.\n\nSo the way I \"read\" my quest card is the following:\n\nThe players must defeat Ungoliants spawn to win the game, if they did not already do so. If US is not on the board search your encounter deck and put it in the staging area.\n\nI think it doesn't make sense to not be able to complete the game because I already defeated US. An alternative way to play this:\n\nfind = looking in the encounter deck and discard pile. Since Ungolianth could spawn more than 1 creature we might have to defeat two of those beasts...tough choice though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45498-rules-q-a-chosen-path/?do=findComment&comment=456779","commentId":456779,"userName":"pwvogt","timestamp":1303336492,"content":" I like your alternative ruling of searching both the encounter draw and discard decks.

It'll be the way I go until we see otherwise in the FAQ.\n\n\n\nThats not an alternate ruling; that's what the card says.\n\nBasically, if ungoliant's spawn isn't already in play, you search through the deck/discard pile until you find it  and place it in the staging area (although by the rules you could choose to add a different spider to the staging area instead if you wanted to delay facing U-spawn but I'm not sure how sensible a tactic that is..).\n\nThe OPs original query was whether they completed the find aspect of the rule because U-spawn was already on the board, not because it was in a discard pile and therefore couldn't be found.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45498-rules-q-a-chosen-path/?do=findComment&comment=456845","commentId":456845,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1303353203,"content":"Really?

If a previous defeat of U-spawn counts for the other random option, this would make Beorn's path the \"bad\" draw\", which thematically doesn't seem right.\n\nWill wait for the FAQ though, I guess\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45498-rules-q-a-chosen-path/?do=findComment&comment=457203","commentId":457203,"userName":"PWBrian","timestamp":1303402952,"content":" I would love to see a FAQ on this adventure.  When we reached the end in our first game, we had already defeated Ungoliant's Spawn, and since we were pulling other spiders out of the discard we weren't sure how this particular spider was supposed to appear.  With Gandalf and a well-oiled Gimli, the fight wasn't too hard, but it's still up in the air at our house whether we should have just declared victory, drawn the card straight from the discard, or continued playing until it appeared naturally."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45498-rules-q-a-chosen-path/?do=findComment&comment=457233","commentId":457233,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1303405815,"content":"Here is the official answer which I posted in another thread too.\n\n \n\nThe \"must find and defeat\" condition begins when the \"Don't Leave the Path\" card takes effect.
