Ebay/Amazon has sellers with the coreX1 sets but they are about £20 and the core itself is only £25.\n\nSo are there enough separate sections in a core for multiple buyers to get a good deal?\n\nMy thoughts:\n\n1: X1 card set (for me please)\n\n2: X2 card set (for those wanting to boost without second core)\n\n3: Remaining card sets (lower value other than multiple deck builds)\n\n4: counters/dials (usefull)\n\n5: encounter sets ( very useful for those making ready-to-run decks or separate nightmare decks)\n\nFive separate chunks (biggest chunk gets the box posted there)\n\nAre they interesting enough to be able to properly split a core set between multiple peoples? (Secondary postage needs adding too)\n\nInterested in thoughts.\n\nAlex\n\n(Ps if FFG did a coreX1 pod id buy it, but they dont)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193289-anyone-consider-buying-and-splitting-a-core-set-ever/?do=findComment&comment=1888487","commentId":1888487,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1447183784,"content":"I don't really understand it, but I'm Netherlands, so it wouldn't work anyway."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193289-anyone-consider-buying-and-splitting-a-core-set-ever/?do=findComment&comment=1888547","commentId":1888547,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1447185896,"content":"> I don't really understand it, but I'm Netherlands, so it wouldn't work anyway.\n\n \n\nIts basically the idea of splitting up the contents of the core set and splitting up the cost.

I find it difficult to spend £20 (ebay) on just that many cards but then also a full set for £25 is better but so much wastage."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193289-anyone-consider-buying-and-splitting-a-core-set-ever/?do=findComment&comment=1891628","commentId":1891628,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1447372392,"content":">  \n> \n> > I just think it'd be hard to find someone who doesn't want what you want.

You can use the other cards as proxies, or to use as regular back when shuffling nightmare in.\n\n \n\nAlex, the only thing I can think of is: take the cards you already have more than 3. Scan and print 1 copy each of the cards you need. Glue the printed cards on the regular cards you're not using.
