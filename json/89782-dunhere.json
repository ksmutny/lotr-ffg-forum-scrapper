Thus he cannot attack Forest Spider in the Quest-phase, unless empowered by another card effect.\n\nFurthermore, when you do make an attack, you normally exhaust the character(s) you use for attacking. Making the character unable to participate in further actions that require him to exhaust (attack/defend/quest/certain triggered abilities). Dunhere has no inherent ability to make him overcome these limitations."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89782-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=857962","commentId":857962,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1378338760,"content":"Thanks.\n\n \n\nIm not a new player, and I know you can only use one action for each character, but Old forest Road reads that you can ready a character so if dunhere would be able to attack before combat phase, I would be able to deal 2 damage to spider before I traveled to the Forest Road and then I could travel to Forest Road, ready Dunhere, and then attack again killing the spider.  If I remember right in the rule book it says that text's that arnt in bold or anything, but just plain text, its a lasting effect.  So I assumed that since Dunhere's ability is plain text, He could use his ability anytime.\n\n \n\nThanks again,\n\nKhamul"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89782-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=857998","commentId":857998,"userName":"Angus Lee","timestamp":1378341395,"content":"> Thanks.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Im not a new player, and I know you can only use one action for each character, but Old forest Road reads that you can ready a character so if dunhere would be able to attack before combat phase, I would be able to deal 2 damage to spider before I traveled to the Forest Road and then I could travel to Forest Road, ready Dunhere, and then attack again killing the spider.  If I remember right in the rule book it says that text's that arnt in bold or anything, but just plain text, its a lasting effect.  So I assumed that since Dunhere's ability is plain text, He could use his ability anytime.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Thanks again,\n> \n> Khamul\n\nDunhere's ability is a constant effect, which means that whenever he is eligible to attack, he can attack an enemy in the staging area if he is attacking alone.  The important part is whenever he is eligible to attack.  His ability does not grant him attack ability outside of the combat phase.  So you can only use him to attack when the normal game rules allow you to do so, unless other card effects change that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89782-dunhere/?do=findComment&comment=858123","commentId":858123,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1378360340,"content":"> Old forest Road reads that you can ready a character\n\nAh had forgotten that part about Old Forest Road.
