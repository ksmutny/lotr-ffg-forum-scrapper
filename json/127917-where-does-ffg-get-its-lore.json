It seems one reason is to make up for the lack of female characters the game might otherwise have.

At least, that's always been how I've read this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127917-where-does-ffg-get-its-lore/?do=findComment&comment=1348207","commentId":1348207,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1417052265,"content":"At first, I did not like the introduction of characters not named in Tolkien's writings.\n\n \n\nBut now, I very much support the idea. Increasing the proportion of female characters is one valid reason for the creation of new characters, but I wonder if the designers might not also have had the following in mind:\n\n \n\n1) Makes it easier to make thematically appropriate decks by utilizing \"filler\" heroes that could have been alive at any period in Tolkien's writings. For example, I recently wanted to play all the Core and Mirkwood quests using the same heroes/deck for every quest, and I wanted all heroes and cards in the deck to fit in with the story (as much as possible, anyway… Steward of Gondor stuck out like a sore thumb). Also, I had only the Core set and Mirkwood AP heroes to work with… so who would have gone on the hunt for Gollum? We know from Unfinished Tales that Aragorn captured Gollum, but to my knowledge, there is no info specifying whether anyone else assisted him… and the best heroes I could think of to accompany him on the LCG quest were Legolas (son of Thranduil, who initiates the quest in Passage Through Mirkwood, and to who's halls Aragorn is charged to bring Gollum in Return to Mirkwood) and Beravor (another Dunedain ranger, like Aragorn). Bilbo was back in the Shire when Aragorn was hunting for Gollum, likewise Frodo, Gimli did not meet Legolas (and Aragorn?) prior the council meeting in Rivendell in Fellowship of the Ring, Eowyn and Theodred (Rohan) would not have been recruited by Gandalf/Thranduil to take part in this mission, and same for King Dain Ironfoot, Bain Son of Brand, Denethor (steward of Gondor) and his son Boromir, Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth… and another newly invented Gondor hero named Eleanor. Gloin? Maybe, but he doesn't fit in so well either. And Core Glorfindel's threat cost is way too high to pair with Aragorn (he otherwise might have been a reasonable choice… if still a bit of a stretch). \n\n \n\n2) Following the above, there must certainly have been other heroic personages in Middle Earth in the period covered between The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings whose deeds were not recorded in those books (that's what The One Ring RPG is all about -- their stories!).  Including them adds flexibility to (thematic) deck design.\n\n \n\nJust my thoughts… I could be totally wrong about the underlying rationale of the designers…  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nEdited November 27, 2014 by TwiceBornh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127917-where-does-ffg-get-its-lore/?do=findComment&comment=1348213","commentId":1348213,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1417052520,"content":">  \n> \n> > Mirlonde.
