(also selling my Warhammer card game too, if you are interested in those as well)\n\nMy collection consists of - Core Set\n\n                                          Complete Shadows of Mirkwood\n\n                                          The Massing at Osgiliath POD\n \nThey are all in Very Good condition and have very rarely been used. If you would like to purchase the collection (I would prefer to sell them all as one set) please e-mail me on ghals (at) hotmail (dot) com. If you would also like the Warhammer collection then please state that too. Reasonable offers will be accepted. I live in the UK and so for ease it may be easier to send to a UK person.\n\nThanks for your time.\n\nGazery\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69974-sadly-selling-my-collection/?do=findComment&comment=684969","commentId":684969,"userName":"beartoes","timestamp":1346315216,"content":"Do you have a Paypal account?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69974-sadly-selling-my-collection/?do=findComment&comment=685122","commentId":685122,"userName":"Gazery","timestamp":1346329675,"content":"Unfortunately I don't, I don't know how easy it is to set up one, but it might be doable."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69974-sadly-selling-my-collection/?do=findComment&comment=686058","commentId":686058,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1346488056,"content":" Well, I'm not in the UK and I don't want the whole set (I'd like SOM 3-6), but if we can work something out do let me know!\n\nShipwreckd@gmail.com"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69974-sadly-selling-my-collection/?do=findComment&comment=686230","commentId":686230,"userName":"Gazery","timestamp":1346519105,"content":"I think I'd prefer to sell the full set together, otherwise I'd end up with a few packs that I can't sell or even use myself.
