The Emyn Muil thing wasn't even an errata, it's on the original card.  The FAQ simply clarified that stage 2 is indeed the final stage of Conflict at the Carrock (it was a FAQ entry, and not under 'errata'). So the victory conditions haven't changed or anything... did you play something differently?"}]}
