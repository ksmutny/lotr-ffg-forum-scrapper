I am a solo player of both games and dont dual play with either.\n\nI have bought Arkham core, Dunwich and Rougarou and have played the core set and one of the Dunwich scenarios but i am finding it much harder to get enthusiastic enough to set up the next Arkham game. I was really excited by Arkham initially upon purchase as it should have provided me the ultimate solo experience, but after a few plays of the core set i cant help but feel a little downbeat about the game. In comparative terms it is still one of better games i own but i am deciding whether to drop out now and just focus again on LOTR.\n\n * Arkham set up seems a bit more fiddly. I know it really is not that much different at all, but i liked the simplicity of grabbing a set of encounter cards and getting going. Setting up locations with the right places attached is a bit more effort. Also i know LOTR player cards so well that the deck building is not overly task heavy, i currently dont know Arkham cards well so it takes a bit of effort to work out which ones i need - this is temporary of course.\n * Mechanics. I do prefer the way LOTR uses all its mechanics within its card decks, i am already becoming a little tired keeping pulling counters from a bag to pass or fail. I do like that you can tailor the difficulty this way but it isnt as smooth running as LOTR.\n * Battles with monsters just feel slightly flat with Arkham at the moment, whereas in LOTR you feel you are building up during the game to take on the largest enemy. Mostly i find taking on the big boss in Arkham or having multiple enemies overly hard to manage and then often you can just run away or quit. I now realising how good the shadow effect mechanic is and how it always holds that unknown trigger to make you breathe a sigh of relief or cry in despair which is much more engaging to deal with.\n * The RPG aspect may not suit me, i largely prefer one off battles against a certain scenario - if i understand right, in order to play a one off against a later cycle pack scenario in Arkham i have to work through the results of a load of previous scenarios first to see what my character is first. This is an elaborate set up requirement for sure.\n * I am just getting too old - it could just come down to this, LOTR was enough for my brain to take on and enjoy and trying to layer in another similar game with its own rules system and i think more to remember in terms of triggers (i always forget the enemy response attack thing) just has become a bit too much. I have found this before occasionally - i sold Mage Knight eventually for this reason.\n\nI suppose i was just interested to see what others who have both games thought. I am certainly of the opinion that Arkham is good, but i am worried that i cant cope with two LCG games in tandem. I am undecided at the moment but thinking of just dropping Arkham and going with Sands of Harad and that cycle instead.   \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2617807","commentId":2617807,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1485864860,"content":"Setup in Arkham is indeed a bit more fiddly, but it is a price for a more deep and polished narrative, and I freaking enjoy that.\n\nArkham Horror had to make the result of it's various interactions unclear, and the way I see it, their only viable alternative were dice. Chaos bag is a more creative and customize-able solution which I whole-heartedly approve of.\n\nThey're flat in both games, but unlike LotR LCG, Arkham allows you to elude your enemies by dodging them. You can argue that LotR has similar thing in form of staging area and engagement cost, but the thing is that in Arkham both fighting and evading are core mechanics, while in LotR \"evading\" is fully manipulated by card effects, and if you're out of them and your threat is high enough - enemy will simply come down and start pounding at you, and there'll be nothing you'll be able to do about it but take the pounding and pound back. As for the shadow cards, that tension is replaced, once again, by a CHAOS bag during an attack.

Just as playing single handed solo LotR, you need a well-rounded hero to succeed in solo. Yet, I had success with different kind of characters outfiddeted to achieve their goals in different ways.

I often forget about those.\n\nWell it seems I am not totally alone in the way Arkham is coming across - I am not ready to throw in the towel just yet. I may just be finding Arkham a little over bearing to keep on top of, so will give it another go when I feel ready. However I have a hunch that my mind doesn't want to mix up two LCG games at once and try to keep on top of all the different deck building of each so I may well decide to stay with LOTR only. I think the next few games of Arkham will be critical ones to decide on my future purchases. Note I don't always find LOTR a joy to solo play, but I do find I have the stamina and desire to keep coming back to many scenarios and have another go. I just haven't felt this with Arkham yet and it isn't the theme, I think its the mechanics the game uses.\n\nJust had a thought - the one element of LOTR I really didn't take to was the time mechanic in some of the Isengard scenarios - maybe I am feeling too much of this in Arkham - being rushed to complete a quest before the next card moves on or else I quit to escape is not really how I like to play these games or that satisfying, I prefer ones where I build a position up or defend solidly until I get an opening. Maybe this is a key factor alongside the drawing of tokens - which in concept I don't mind - but the reality of repeatedly digging into the bag over and over just grates a bit.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2619170","commentId":2619170,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1485902940,"content":"One of the things I dislike about the saga campaigns is having to keep track of the burdens and boons etc. As well as the feeling that I didn't \"succeed\" if I didn't get all of the available boons.\n\nThis is built into arkham."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2622574","commentId":2622574,"userName":"xchan","timestamp":1486066487,"content":"> On 31/1/2017 at 5:03 AM, Crusaderlord said:\n> \n> I suppose i was just interested to see what others who have both games thought. I am certainly of the opinion that Arkham is good, but i am worried that i cant cope with two LCG games in tandem. I am undecided at the moment but thinking of just dropping Arkham and going with Sands of Harad and that cycle instead.\n\nI'm in a similar situation than you. I was ready to support a third LCG and since I love the theme and LotR I was really hyped about AH. However, after reading all the preview articles I got seriously worried that the game might not be for me.\n\nDespite that, I got a core set and tried the game for myself. Didn't ejoy the limited number of actions that restrict what cards can I play and when each turn, but I could get used to (and after the card grows, the release of more fast cards will help with that).\n\nBut what I absolutelly hated is how the randomness works in this game. Neither the chaos bag or the encounter deck worked for me. The first because it introudeces a push your luck mechanic without no means to mitigate the outcome (as of right now). You can overcommitt all your deck cards into a test and still fail due to the autofail token. It wouldn't be so much if it was not THE only game mechanic. You want to investigate? TEST. You want to fight? TEST. You want to evade? TEST. Look a NPE character appeared! TEST. Draw an encounter card? 50% = TEST. It got tiresome pretty fast. I ended up using an app as a substitute for the chaos bag and my enjoyment of the game improved a little, but still, it just bothers me too much.\n\nAnd as for the ecnounter deck, I never got the impresion it gelled well with how the game worked. While in LotR is an excellent way of introducing a worthy and challanging oponent, and the shadow system is a elegant way to capture the feeling of surprise only a real oponent can give you when he plays an event in the worst time possible; the encounter deck in AH never gave me that. It just a way to add extra randomisation, but most of the time is the agenda/act and locations the ones that carry all the surprises and interesting challanges.\n\nIt doesn't help that the timing is right after you get new cards in the upkeep phase but before you can actually play them in the investigator's phase. It really annoys me that I can't get to play my new cards before I have to deal with what the encounter deck spawns. \"Me: Look, I draw my weapon!\" \"Encounter deck: Too bad, you either take an attack to your face first (attack of opportunity) or deal with the monster I just decided to throw at you barehanded first\". \"Me: Look I got the only card in my deck that can help me improve my willpower to deal with those pesky encounter deck cards!\" \"Encounter deck: Sorry to hear that! Better make you do that test now then!\". \n\nIt all makes me feel disattatched to my deck and most of the time not caring for it or even not wanting to draw due to the weaknesses having a high chance to screw everything up.\n\nI'm now trying the cheating variant to see if I can make the committing system work for me (because I tend to WANT to play my cards for their text, and not for some icon in a random test), and I might make some extra rules on how the encounter deck works to see if I enjoy the game more. But for now, I won't buy anything else for the game.\n\n \n\n> On 31/1/2017 at 7:04 AM, awp832 said:\n> \n> +Deckbuilding.   I think I give AH the win in the deckbuilding area.   I really enjoy LotR deckbuilding, but AH deckbuilding is a lot more thematic.  As someone who always tries to  make thematic lotR decks, I like the fact that AH decks have a bit more guidance.  I like each card belonging to a certain class which associates with certain characters.  I like the system of cards costing experience points, and leveling up.    It gives the AH campaign the Saga feel, only it's the whole game, not just the Saga boxes.  Currently there aren't a whole lot of options for AH, but thats because the game is so new.  I really look forward to AH deckbuilding once we have a few more cards.  \n\nI completelly agree with the first 3 points but not with the deckbuilding aspect. I know that with only one core set there's no deckbuilding options at all, but so far, I haven't been excited by any of the new cards (or the old ones) to want to try and build a deck around them.

I was just looking at the mechanics and ignoring everything else. \n\n \n\n> Quote\n> \n> I believe there are proper rules for setting up a stand-alone scenario regardless of how deep in campaign it is situated.

That was the first thing I checked after I got the game, because I'm not a fan of the campaign system and everyone (devs included) said that the game would be able to be played as standalone with no problem when I raised my concerns during the preview articles.\n\nAfter reading the rules, I knew that was just not the case. If you want to play standalone a new chapter you just got you need to go through all the previous chapters on the campaign reading the resolutions of everyone of them and choosing the one you like the most/prefer. So basically, you need to either buy everything prior to the chapter you got or go online searching for the campaign book (which so far haven't been done for the Dunwich Legacy). I don't know how are they planning on doing that, but if they don't release the previous campaign book when the new chapter is released, then playing the new chapter as a standalone would be impossible. \n\n \n\n> On 31/1/2017 at 0:03 PM, Teamjimby said:\n> \n> One thing I have noticed is that, like Bullroarer said, one-handed solo just isn't very good.  All it takes is one nasty enemy and either a weakness or no weapon/shriveling and you are bogged down completely.  Many investigators just don't work in solo.  I'm not a huge fan of solo LotR either, but I will still play that way every once in a while.  After two solo runs through the core campaign, I have lost all desire to play solo.  I haven't figured out why I dislike it so much.  Even though there is limited direct player interaction in multiplayer, I feel like there are still a lot of group decisions to be made and discussions to have.\n\nI had a similar experience. I thought this game would work true solo, but after a couple of runs with different investigators I knew that I would end up playing dual handed. Basically, what made me decide that is the exploration part of the game (moving to new locations to flip them and get more clues), which is what I enjoy the most. I feel that with only one player my exploration was seriously handicapped by the limited number of action. Playing with 2 investigators allows me to cover more ground, visiting more locations and further developing the story.\n\n \n\n> On 31/1/2017 at 4:49 PM, Bullroarer Took said:\n> \n> One of the things I dislike about the saga campaigns is having to keep track of the burdens and boons etc. As well as the feeling that I didn't \"succeed\" if I didn't get all of the available boons.\n> \n> This is built into arkham.\n\nLike you I don't like the campaign system either. However, I found out that redoing the scenario until I achieve the outcome I want has been working for me. It's easier to keep track of all the burdens/boons/story assets I get and allows me to try new levelled up options if the first ones didn't convinced me without having to restart the campaign.\n\nEdited February 2, 2017 by xchan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2622666","commentId":2622666,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1486068374,"content":"Can't see what stopping ya from just making decisions on the fly when they come up regardless of anything that should've happened in the past."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2622698","commentId":2622698,"userName":"xchan","timestamp":1486069215,"content":"Bcause those desicions usually come with some penalties attached.

We know LotR needed that.\n\nFor instance, the encounter decks are not quite there yet. They are just too small and full of bland triggers & tests.

As far as encounter decks go, yes strictly speaking, AH has smaller decks -25-30, on average, compared to (a rough glance at Hall of Beorn) 35-50 for LOTR. However, the difference is variety. LOTR might have more cards, but 5 of those will be Goblin Swordsmen, or Underworld Dissident, or Savage Trollspawn. I don't think AH has an encounter card that's more than a 3x in a single deck. But this makes the game harder. As any card gamer knows, a tighter deck means easier combos. Think of the encounter deck not as random Orcs thrown in your way, but a simulated AI. He gets to bring a well-constructed deck, and a small deck means those annoying combos go off easier. It might seem repetitive, but it does heighten the tension of each card draw.

However, instead of just losing one test, these are cards that can quite literally cost you the entire game. Or shadow effects like \"If the defending character is an ally, discard it from play\", or \"Until the end of the round, this enemy cannot take damage\". I think the randomness is just as annoying in both games, and also not fair to see the tentacle token as \"no fun\" but insta-death LOTR encounter cards as OK.\n\nHere's the important difference: In Arkham, if I autofail a critical test, I just sigh but look for other options. You can resign, you can fight well enough to earn some XP regardless, you can find alternative paths to resolution. You don't need to \"win\". You still get to move on. However, in LOTR where each scenario is played as a standalone, if on turn 2 I get a card like one of the ones above and it's impossible to win..... I have no options. There's no \"well you didn't win but you did well enough!\" resolution to work towards.

Only just got into the original Lovecraft stories at that point and hadn't played any previous AH boardgames, but I knew FFG would deliver. I've played through the core set with my fiancée and we really enjoyed it. She prefers gameplay in AH over LOTR because of the strong story aspect and how there's barely any mental arithmetic. Once you've built up your \"army of allies\" in LOTR, 90% of the rest of the game consists of just keeping track of numbers, particularly in 3-4-player games. Having one investigator and up to one ally is refreshing. I also like what they've done with locations compared to LOTR, even though setup is a bit fiddly. (So can LOTR's setup be, particularly in newer scenarios where you may have a separate enemy deck and certain cards set aside etc.)\n\nThe only real downside for me when it comes to AH LCG is the deckbuilding and how it relates to story progression. On the one han I like the sense of accomplishment when you can upgrade e.g. equipment or a spell in AH, but it's all tightly connected to the narrative of a specific campaign. Deckbuilding is a lot more flexible in LOTR and I enjoy just putting a deck together and using it in any scenario without having to worry about progression.

I consider that a feature, but it depends on your approach to the game.\n\nCampaign play also mitigates the effect of the chaos bag.  Drawing an auto-fail doesn't necessarily auto-fail the investigation, and failing the investigation doesn't end the campaign -- there are resolutions that allow continuing on for a variety of results.  That's in contrast too LotR -- die or threat out, and you're starting over. Of course, if you don't like the auto-fail token, just take it out, replace it with a -7, or whatever. The plus of the chaos bag is it is tailorable. (I'm not a huge fan of the chaos bag mechanic, if I'm honest -- I'd prefer dice if we have to have a random element on top of the cards -- but it does work and tailorability is a huge feature.)\n\nUltimately, they are different games, and AH has built on the mechanics from LotR.  Though I prefer the world of Middle Earth, I do prefer the game play of the AH LCG. It's less fiddly, requires less upkeep to stay on top of game state, has a superior location mechanic, and overall does a better job of intertwining story and gameplay than LotR.

you're not complaining about AH, because you're not complaining about AH.  You're complaining about your house-ruled version of AH.  I honestly don't know how many people try to play it like this, but I can say pretty confidently that it is the wrong way to play the game.  You're trying to fix the game by breaking a big part of the design in a way that doesn't actually make it any better.\n\nYou don't get that vibe with LOTR because they're different games :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  The full campaign is one story that builds to a climax.  LOTR doesn't really do that, even in the Saga, but I think that's honestly poor design.  Chasing down a small band of orcs should not be harder than the siege of Helms Deep, but it was (at least for us).\n\nOn the Chaos Bag, I don't think the bag is bad, even with the autofail.  You make risk vs. reward choices with every test.  Sometimes it works - we pulled a true win out of Night of the Zealot by carefully applying resources to win 8 of 9 tests and win the game.  When we restarted we came down to the wire on the first scenario and failed 3 tests in a row - two due to the autofail and one because of the Elder Sign, when we needed to fail it.  But even then, we were on our last turn because we drew 3 Ancient Evils in a single turn, and let a Ghoul come to us rather than sending Zoey after it, and because we were greedy about clearing out locations for XP rather than working the scenario.  If we had another turn, we would have been able to pull it out.  Instead, we were all eaten and get to restart the campaign.  But even as we started at those red and blue tokens, it's a mistake to say they made us fail.  If we'd pushed harder, or had a Mystic who could cancel one of the Ancient Evils, etc, we would have been fine.\n\nThe important thing to recognize is that it is never required or expected to succeed at every test.  You expect some to fail, and plan accordingly.  And yes, that means that you can rarely just throw massive amounts of resources at a problem and be guaranteed to win.  That's part of balancing the risk and reward.  You know what's in the bag that can make you fail, and you decide what's worth risking, but you're never truly guaranteed safe.  But I don't truly think that feels any different from LOTR to me.  Sure, we may be long past designs like Sudden Pitfall, but I've still had any number of times that a single shadow card has ended what was otherwise a well-positioned game.  Especially in Saga, where a lost hero is basically a lost game, bad luck on a single shadow card can end it fast.\n\nThere may not be many ways to mitigate the bag yet (mostly Survivors) but while a lot of people seem to be comparing it to the mitigation options with LOTR, how many shadow cancels were there in the Core+Mirkwood?  I'd have to go back to check to be sure, but I'm pretty sure if you weren't running Spirit for Hasty Stroke or Lore for Burning Brand, you just ate whatever it threw at you.\n\nEdit: Also worth noting that there are still plenty of Sudden Pitfall effects even outside of your attempts to mitigate them.  We just finished Wastes of Eriador...  Trying hitting a Predatory Wolves (or two) on setup in a 4-player game, or Lost in the Wilderness.  Pretty much game over on those single flips.  Whatever your view on the potential to fail a test is, I've never set up Arkham and said \"Well, that was a good game.  Reshuffle and try again?\" before I took even a single action.\n\nEdited February 28, 2017 by Buhallin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2659936","commentId":2659936,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1488245065,"content":"> 30 minutes ago, Buhallin said:\n> \n>  \n> \n> There may not be many ways to mitigate the bag yet (mostly Survivors) but while a lot of people seem to be comparing it to the mitigation options with LOTR, how many shadow cancels were there in the Core+Mirkwood?  I'd have to go back to check to be sure, but I'm pretty sure if you weren't running Spirit for Hasty Stroke or Lore for Burning Brand, you just ate whatever it threw at you.\n\nPretty sure Dawn Take You All (Leadership) was in the Mirkwood cycle... and maybe Rider of the Mark (spirit ally) and Dunedain Watcher (Leadership ally)?

I think the same can be said for LOTR. With some exceptions, it is a well themed game, and that contributes to the enjoyment. It's not just about getting thrashed by generic types and numbers, it's about how well it brings those to life.\n\nIf you're not someone who enjoys dark endings then that's cool, but it doesn't make Arkham a worse game. Just the opposite, honestly. The fact that you don't like it tells me that they captured the theme very well. If someone was disappointed that LOTR wasn't just a fighting game of battles and killing, and what was all this questing silliness, what would you tell them? Same goes for Arkham.\n\nArkham is not LOTR.  It does a lot better than LOTR, and a few things worse, but a lot of it is just different.

The worst was the first mythos pack though - again, you go through all of the complicated setup, try to set the mood and get in the narrative zone, and then get killed about 1/3 of the way through the scenario.\n\nWith LotR, the focus is on the mechanics, so if you die you don't lose nearly as much momentum, and you can far more easily reshuffle and try again. It's akin to getting killed in a videogame, where you reload and try immediately. With Arkham, it feels more like you sit down for a 3 hour session of Call of Cthulhu RPG, and 20 minutes in the GM says \"and you die. See you next week, and we'll pick up the story at a later point. I guess you'll never know what happened to the Rougarou etc.\" You feel that you've missed out on story content and it's very unsatisfying.\nNow, I know people say you can just try again anyway - but with the different \"resolutions\" and all, it seems to me that that isn't the *intended experience*. So... what is the intended experience? It would be great if on your first playthrough, you just about make it \"through\" each scenario whilst suffering along the way. But more often than not, you die at a far less satisfying moment. It doesn't seem possible to have a compelling narrative when the random elements of the game might kill you.\n\nThere are other issues making this worse. A lot of the location effects (barriers etc) seem almost impossible to overcome depending on your investigator, and compared to LotR it frequently seems that there is just nothing you can do on your turn to avoid being killed. And I like the idea of exploring the locations, but when playing solo you can get really screwed because of the limited movements, and only realising in hindsight that you've wasted your precious actions by going to the wrong locations or pursuing the objective that is actually not best for your investigator.\n\nI really, really wanted to like this.

It's to see what happens, and if you hit a situation where some location is impossible for your Investigator to enter, or an enemy impossible to kill, to look for alternative ways of finishing. Find another exit, VP farm and resign, look for another Objective. Each Investigator should not be able to accomplish the same ends. Rex isn't going to kill boss enemies, but can easily find clues and get other resolutions. Similarly, Zoey might find it tough to investigate the whereabouts of missing professors, but science experiments run amok, she can kill with exigent impunity. In reality would a librarian kill winged snakes? Or would an Irish gangster care to hunt down hidden artefacts? I guess the point is this game is an RPG.

Maybe that´s because encounter deck has more card types - it spawns enemies, treacheries AND locations so you can get more combinations in different games but still leaded the right way by quests and unique cards at the right time, so you play the game and you are inside the story at the same time.

I play a few times and then I say to myself (before the game): \"this one is THE ONE game and after this point I will continue with every outcome I´´ ll get and with the chosen resolution.

There, you just have these generic locations taking up staging area space, providing threat, that can lock you out of progress. In Arkham, you physically move your card to different locations, and since you're playing as an individual, you can really feel the story that you are in that location, and your buddy's across town, and enemies are in the building next door. As opposed to this amorphous feeling of location in LOTR.\n\nI really do think it is just a matter of perceptions. Did you only play the first scenario? The enemies in that are a bit lackluster except for the boss, but overall, Arkham enemies have a ton of gametext...\n\nhttps://arkhamdb.com/find?q=t%3Aenemy&sort=set&view=scan&decks=all [https://arkhamdb.com/find?q=t%3Aenemy&sort=set&view=scan&decks=all]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2673858","commentId":2673858,"userName":"tyrion003","timestamp":1489011501,"content":"> 4 minutes ago, Network57 said:\n> \n> I really do think it is just a matter of perceptions.

The unigue enemies from Midnight Mask are great (that´s best scenario out of the core set for me), but all the ghouls and small cultists... Really don´t know.\n\nOne important thing for me - this is just a core set and I compare LotR which has great history and really deep cardpool with many quests and ideas with just now starting game. Comparing both core sets will be much more fair for AH. Of course I´ ll try whole first cycle and I supposse I will see the direction and possible improvements (from my point of view, of course) in game design. I strongly believe that I will \"catch\" later cause I like the theme (much more than LotR)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241416-effects-of-lotr-lcg-on-arkham-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=2673867","commentId":2673867,"userName":"tyrion003","timestamp":1489011776,"content":"Network57 Ad Locations - you still have usually 2-4 unique locations which comes in the right order and in the right time to drive the story. \n\nBut you´re right about the move through Arkham - once I evaded hunter enemy I wasn´t able to deal with ad I moved through the city from one location to another while the enemy pursued me and I tried to take a clue here or there during the run - that was great moment.
