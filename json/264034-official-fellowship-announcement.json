(So that would certainly bar the \"big announcement\" to be the next cycle, though as someone said on the forums, that 9 months hiatus would certainly make it look like a big announcement).\n\nThe most probable speculation I've seen around are:\n\n * Something to do with the First and/or Second Ages of Lords of the Rings, since licensing is already more flexible following the departure (resignation?) of Christopher Tolkien\n * Something to do with the new amazon series (as a direct tie to what I just said)\n * A second core set, as a new entry point for new players, maybe collated with the above ides (First Age core set or \"amazon-kinda-series\" core set). Note that at this point, I'm putting a \"kinda\" in there because the amazon series is still in its early developing stages I believe, it'd be just impossible that FFG would announce anything related to something no one knows, not even amazon.\n * A change of packaging, like they did for Call of Cthulhu at some point: now developing and selling Deluxe-size products only (no more AP). The \"big announcement\" would serve a way to make it look like it's great, when it'd just announce the game's fading (and it will at some point, after all, we don't know the selling figures and how they relate to FFG's/Asmodee's current commercial policies and business plan)\n * Brandon playing with errata'd Boromir\n\nThose are probable.\n\nNow what I would like:\n\n * Dat new coreset being based on The War of the Ring appendixes, and lost tales. So much to tell there: Battle of Dale (Thorin Stonehelm, Bard son of Brand), 1st, 2nd battles of the Fords of Isen, the Ents vs Orcs in the Westfold, the Assault on Lorien / Dol Guldur (though I don't own Attack on Dol Guldur yet and it certainly seems like it)\n * Dat new coreset to integrate a real generic campaign mode, that you could use with the new products as well the old ones\n\nEdited November 27, 2017 by banania"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264034-official-fellowship-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=3098449","commentId":3098449,"userName":"tomas.daniel","timestamp":1511818806,"content":"Just please do not make Second Edition..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/264034-official-fellowship-announcement/?do=findComment&comment=3098517","commentId":3098517,"userName":"Stalkingwolf","timestamp":1511820439,"content":"> 24 minutes ago, tomas.daniel said:\n> \n> Just please do not make Second Edition...\n\nAgreed!!!

A campaign that shifts and changes depending on what choices you make during each quest. More than Saga campaign, which had limited carryover. This would be on a much grander scale, where quests could be harder or easier based off previous quests. Maybe you’d even skip entire quest phases, or open envelopes of secret quest cards. I think something like this that wasn’t connected to the LOTR Saga would allow flexibility in quest building. \n\nThey’ve already started to link the non-Saga campaigns together, where we ended the Stormcaller by crashing into Harad.

I'm currently playing through the Dreamchaser cycle and I really like what they did with some of the new location rules. Made locations much less abstract. I can also see levels of player cards come in like AHTCG, more general player cards in the new core set etc. Not essential to an existing player, but really good for new ones. "}]}
