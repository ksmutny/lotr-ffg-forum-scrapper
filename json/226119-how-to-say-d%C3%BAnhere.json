In China there are two translation editions of LOTR, one comes from Taiwan about 10 years ago and in that book Dúnhere pronounces like dun-here， and in the Shanghai edition which published 2 years ago Dúnhere pronounces like DOON-heh-reh."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226119-how-to-say-d%C3%BAnhere/?do=findComment&comment=2333445","commentId":2333445,"userName":"PiebeatsCake","timestamp":1469812069,"content":"I like to call him \"done here\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226119-how-to-say-d%C3%BAnhere/?do=findComment&comment=2333474","commentId":2333474,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1469812993,"content":"Are you sure Old English didn't have the silent 'e' concept?

Just checked the pronunciation of Aelfwine, a common anglo-saxon name Tolkien used a lot, and while I couldn't find any certain information on how it's pronounced, there's a possibility it is pronounced as \"Aelf-win\", which would make Dúnhere as \"DOON-her\".

If you assume Rohirric is based off that and not Old English, then it would be /h I 9/ (WorldBet transcription) - NB the vowel is closer to a modern \"long e\", as the English silent <e> marks a vowel raising/lengthening with the Great Vowel Shift. Otherwise it would be roughly a schwa sound, like /h E 9 &/, in Old English. Additionally the <r> would probably be less of a rhotic sonorant and either more uvular or a coronal tap. I.e. pronounce Dunhere like it's a Spanish word, but with a short <e> on the end.\n\nI don't think Tolkien left much describing which variety he based the Rohirrim on, but my guess is Old English based off the morphophonemics of other proper names like Meduseld and Eorlingas.\n\nEdited July 30, 2016 by Network57"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226119-how-to-say-d%C3%BAnhere/?do=findComment&comment=2333919","commentId":2333919,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1469828611,"content":"Network57, Tolkien was an Oxford proffessor of Old English and made studies on Beowulf and translated other Old English literature. Most of the names and words in Rohirric are either just straight up OE words (thinking of Ceorl), or slightly modified variations like Eowyn (which in standard OE would be Eowine). I'm pretty sure he was very explicit on that. So, with that said I agree with your proposed pronunciation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/226119-how-to-say-d%C3%BAnhere/?do=findComment&comment=2334235","commentId":2334235,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1469844867,"content":"This is an awesome thread!
