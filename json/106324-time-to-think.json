If you follow the link you can read how 20 players playing the same decks and encounter decks where cards were ordered in the same way. It's called a duplicate game.\n\nhttp://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/101785-lotr-lcg-duplicate-tournament-solo/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/101785-lotr-lcg-duplicate-tournament-solo/]\n\nAmazingly, each player had a different outcome based on how they \"thought\" about the state of the game and the chocies they were confronted with. Of course this is not the same exact question as yours, since I was interested to see if we all think the same way when confronted with the same challenge. This turned out not to be the case, and reading some of the game plays really hilights how different players with various playstyls think when playing. Although, players chocies early on influence how the encounter deck plays out later, so decks would get out of sync after a round or 2, but it was usually based on a choice the player made.\n\nBetter yet, if your up for it, read through my intro and play the game, and compare your game to the other players. It may shed some light on how you think while playing."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106324-time-to-think/?do=findComment&comment=1085645","commentId":1085645,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1400153343,"content":"Most of the time there isn't that much to think about. I stop to think whenever it seems necessary I suppose.\n\nMost of the situations in the game are more about making a probability judgement than being able to actually find a solution. (The best use of resources in the planning phase for instance).\n\nI've found that bigger games tend to have more moments where you need to stop and think (who should take this enemy, who can handle that enemy). In solo I'm not sure I would stop to think much at all - just make the play that seemed best and move on straight away."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106324-time-to-think/?do=findComment&comment=1085648","commentId":1085648,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1400153615,"content":"I play mostly solo and usually I just fly through the games.
