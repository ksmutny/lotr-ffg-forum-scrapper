I don't know if it is always that slow but since then I only order from Potomac or minaturemarket if I want things within a few days."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39297-whats-the-fastest-way-to-get-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=394390","commentId":394390,"userName":"jogo","timestamp":1291877920,"content":"Go the a con were it is presented and take it. xD"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39297-whats-the-fastest-way-to-get-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=394464","commentId":394464,"userName":"9thimmortal","timestamp":1291891893,"content":"MOST of the time I have had really good turn times from FFG.\n\nHowever, last time was pretty so-so (about a week).  It was funny actually, I bought a bunch to have it ready for the Days of Ice and Fire at FFG's HQ in Minny...I was expecting it a day or two before I left.  I get an e-mail the day I leave saying it has shipped, from the place I was driving to!  Drat!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39297-whats-the-fastest-way-to-get-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=400534","commentId":400534,"userName":"ItsTheDukester","timestamp":1293557159,"content":"Narsil0420 said:\n\nIs ordering directly from FFG the fastest way to get the game (I live in California) or would amazon or another retailer be quicker? Thanks for chiming in!\n\nDirect from FFG is acceptably quick ... but not lightning-quick, as you seem to be interested in.\n\nForget Amazon; they are next to useless from new game releases. They just aren't set up to handle them. You'll end up extremely frustrated.\n\nWhen I experience an It Must Be Mine! moment, I always go straight to a retailer that specializes in games. My personal choice is Noble Knight Games [http://www.nobleknight.com] — quick, reliable, trustworthy. There are other good ones out there, too (Funagain, B&B, etc.). Establish an account at one of them, make sure your address and CC info. is correct, then start mashing the button when the game is announced.\n\nI'll be doing Noble Knight for this game — it's a Day One purchase for me.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39297-whats-the-fastest-way-to-get-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=400712","commentId":400712,"userName":"Vondur","timestamp":1293614339,"content":"To my knowledge most \"release date\" sort of products ie: movies/music/games are usually shipped to stores and distributors before the actual release date so that they can put the product out on that date. You might want to check with a local gaming store and ask if they'd be receiving the game that way.\n\n \n\nIn cases like this I feel fortunate to live near Fantasy Flight HQ.  I've already seen some upcoming games on display at the Event Center, like Mansions of Madness. cool.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/cool.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/39297-whats-the-fastest-way-to-get-this-game/?do=findComment&comment=410454","commentId":410454,"userName":"Julia","timestamp":1295377989,"content":"TheDukester said:\n\nWhen I experience an It Must Be Mine! moment, I always go straight to a retailer that specializes in games.

I was skimming the threads, searching for some news about the release date of this LCG, and I read your post. Never ever heard of them, but thanks to you I found a game I've been searching for years.
