This month we'll be playing three quests from the KD/Dwarrowdelf saga. The quests are:\n\n1) Flight from Moria (Khazad Dum deluxe)\n2) The Watcher in the Water\n3) Shadow and Flame\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n1) Each player will construct a 50+ card deck, then use that exact deck against all three quests. You may use that deck freely against any quests (include the three quests in the league) prior to the run for testing purposes, but you may not use any trial runs for your official results.\n\n2) At least one of the heroes must be from a box with those quests. This means that you must have at least one of Bifur, Dwalin, Lore Aragorn, and Elrond.\n\n3) Your score against each quest will be how much help you need to defeat it, based on the Grace of the Valar variant invented by Seastan. It works like this:\n\nFor each token you have, after you draw/mulligan your initial hand you can choose to draw a card or give a hero a resource. This happens one at a time, so if I use my first token to draw a card, I see the card before I decide whether to use my second token for a card or a resource.\n\nThe original variant starts at zero tokens and gains two tokens if you lose quickly (first five turns) and one if you do not -- however, for the purposes of this league I will allow you to start a quest at any number of tokens, and adjust by as many as you want. The only rules for adding/reducing tokens are these:\n\nRule 1) If you lose a quest with X tokens, you cannot play that quest again with X or less tokens.\nRule 2) If you defeat a quest with Y tokens, you cannot play that quest again with Y or more tokens.\n\nSo for example, if I start with six tokens against Shadow and Flame and defeat it, I can play it again with 0-5 tokens. If I then try with three tokens and lose, I can play it again with 4 or 5 tokens. If I try with four and lose, I can play it again with 5 tokens. If I win, my final score for that quest is 5, and if I lose my final score for the quest is 6. (Alternatively, I could've decided that 6 was a good enough score the first time I played it, and just have my final score be 6 without playing again.)\n\nRemember that tokens do not carry over between quests. When playing Wacher in the Water it does not matter how many tokens I needed to defeat Flight from Moria.\n\n4) You are not required to publish your deck, but providing a ringsdb link is encouraged (otherwise I may need to ask you for your decklist at the end of the month if required for a tiebreaker. You are required to reveal which Heroes you used, and how many cards in your deck came from outside KD/Dwarrowdelf, Hobbit saga and a single core. Do not include outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck itself.\n\n5) Tiebreakers have frequently mattered and decided last month's league. Here are the tiebreakers, in order:\n---\n1st) The number of outside cards (i.e. not from KD/Dwarrowdelf, Hobbit saga or a single core) used in the deck. Do not count outside heroes in this count, only cards in the deck. Less cards is better.\n\n2nd) The number of heroes specifically from Hobbit saga and KD/Dwarrowdelf. More is better.\n\n3rd) The number of heroes used from this list: Bifur, Dwalin, LoAragorn, Elrond. More is better.\n\n4th) The number of cards in the deck outside Hobbit saga and KD/Dwarrowdelf. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n5th) The number of cards outside Khazad Dum, Watcher in the Water, and Shadow and Flame. Less is better, and core cards are considered \"outside\" for this tiebreaker.\n\n6th) Performance in April's Solo League (if you didn't play or finish April's League, a median performance will be assumed). Whoever did worst wins this tiebreaker.\n---\n\n6) 1st place gets to choose the cycle for July's league, 2nd place gets to choose a quest from that cycle, and 3rd place gets to choose a quest *not* to be used from that cycle. In an effort to expand the diversity of decks used, the last place player will choose an additional cycle that may be used for deckbuilding in July's league. June's cycle will be chosen by the winner of April's league.\n\n7) Weekly deadlines will be on Monday at 11pm Eastern. Only the final deadline really matters for scoring -- the first two deadlines are only to be included in intermediate standings.\n\nFlight From Moria: May 13th\nWatcher in the Water: May 20th\nShadow and Flame: May 27th\n\nðŸ˜Ž I've created a google spreadsheet for results here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jANFIG04ZYHNaKqFMfhVC85L0k5FVaXYgm7u7aHrgcM/edit?usp=sharing [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jANFIG04ZYHNaKqFMfhVC85L0k5FVaXYgm7u7aHrgcM/edit?usp=sharing]\n\nTo join the league, merely add your name and information about your deck to the spreadsheet, then enter your results as you have them. Please give a link to your deck if you built or published it on ringsdb, but it is not required.\n\nIf you wish you may run additional decks against the quests and record your results (I hope to do this), but only the first entry will be considered for the competition itself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/294790-solo-league-9-dwarrowdelf-with-hobbit-saga-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3694686","commentId":3694686,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1556826703,"content":"Let's kick things off!

There are only four outside cards used, and all of them are from a second Core Set.\n\nI beat Flight from Moria on the first attempt, but I decked myself, lost Gimli to A Foe Beyond, and almost threated out before I sealed the win!

New Devilry prevented me from grabbing the Abandoned Tools with Narrow Paths, which would prove pivotal. By the time I arrived at Escape from Darkness, my deck was empty and my board was full. At this point I had to decide whether I wanted to cycle back through the quest cards for Narrow Paths to grab Abandoned Tools, or camp out and sit until it came off the top of the encounter deck.\n\nWell, I chose the latter, and Abandoned Tools was LITERALLY THE LAST CARD IN THE ENCOUNTER DECK! :lol: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_laugh.png] My heart skipped a beat when it went by as a shadow card, but thankfully the when the reshuffle regressed to the mean; the Tools where only four cards deep.

Â Still took a bit of dancing with the encounter deck as over time it built up a couple Goblin Archers. Â Had to use more Gandalf power to get them out of the staging area. Â Meanwhile A Very Good Tale is doing its thing and i'm building up quite the pack of dwarves.Â  The encounter deck wasn't out of tricks though as it threw two Great Cave Trolls at me, fortunately at different times.

Â There was one point where I thought I lost due to A Foe Beyond but fortunately Dori was around to take the hit. Â I finally reached Escape from the Darkness and between a couple Crams and an Erebor record keeper Bombur was able to dig the party out.

There was a brief moment of panic on turn two, when Hasty Council was revealed followed immediately by A Foe Beyond and I was forced to deal 4 damage to Dain. However, this did allow me to bypass the Wrong Turn quest card. Abandoned Tools was discarded early as a Shadow card, but I got it back with Narrow Paths. Mostly I got a fairly easy ride from the encounter deck. The only thing of note was that seemingly every time I killed a Goblin Spearman it replaced itself via its Shadow Effect. Escape from Darkness was the very last quest card that I saw (having bypassed all the others except Narrow Paths), which I cleared in threeÂ turns even with a Cave In thanks to Erebor Record Keeper. Dain would have perished to a Shadow Effect on the last turn had Dori not been in play. The Nameless Fear was at five threat.\n\nWhen I first played this quest progression style I had so much trouble with it 2-handed, it was strange to revisit it and have such an easier time.
