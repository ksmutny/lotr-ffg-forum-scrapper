My goal is to play single player initially and have the optimum deck building options.\n\n\n\nIf you want 'optimum' building options you have to get three core sets, only then do you have three copies of every card. You only need one copy of every adventure pack.\n\nIf you want to supply up to two players with cards you won't need anything else since you probably won't have sphere overlap in two decks that are supposed to complement each other. The only reason to get more than one copy of an AP would be if it contained a super-powerful neutral card that is a must-include in every deck (like Gandalf in the core set)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45911-how-much-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=460282","commentId":460282,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1303959793,"content":"assuming 1-sphere decks, then a 2nd core set would give you about 13 extra usable cards per deck (2nd or 3rd copies of cards not included x3)\n\na third core set would only give you 3rd copies of the 1x cards from the core set, so about 12 useful cards, instead of 50ish for the second set. (I've not included Gandalfs in these figures, so it depends how many decks you're running at once.\n\nObviously, quest and encounter cards from extra sets serve little purpose.\n\nRoughly though, on UK prices, a 2nd core set will see you paying about 50p per useful card, a 3rd set, more than £2 per card. However, as jhaelen said, if you want 3 of everything, 3 sets is the only option."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45911-how-much-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=460437","commentId":460437,"userName":"Madduxx","timestamp":1303984747,"content":"Interesting. Thanks for the info! I would have thought they had considered the players that would want full deck building options, and don't want to buy 3 core sets or multiple adventure packs for a small % of cards they'd need/want. Especially considering they have had this same issue with other games. It also sounds like an easy fix if they'd offer additional options for purchasing duplicates of just the cards you'd need out out of the core set. One can hope!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45911-how-much-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=460533","commentId":460533,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1303995742,"content":"It has been said before about the other LCG's but it is not likely to change any time soon.

I would like full deck building options. I'm hesitant to invest knowing how little I'll get post 1 core. And specifically knowing FFG knows that too. I'm sure they have done the % on how many skip on the game because of that vs. those that are willing to do it and it comes out in their favor, but it just seems wrong (sucker?). I don't want to have to do this sort of purchase on future products too.\n\nThe longer I wait and consider it, the more likely I believe I'm going to pass on the game. That said I hope players enjoy it and it does look fun. Just not > $100 initial investment fun. gran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif] I'll likely wait and try to pick up a lot once someone quits the game to pick things up at a more reasonable price."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45911-how-much-to-buy/?do=findComment&comment=461558","commentId":461558,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1304185240,"content":"You only need one core set and can be more than happy with just that. Especially once the adventure packs are rolling out. 60 new cards per month. I myself plan on getting two but that is because I am a bit of a completist and like to have a set for my binders. I do the same thing with AGoT and I own at least one of every card for that game. Was more than happy with one core set for a very long time. Only reason I ever got a second was because I wanted to build more decks than I really need.
