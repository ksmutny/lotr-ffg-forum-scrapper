(I dont have real cards so i use proxy).\n\nHis ability draw 1 more card per turn amazing.He also can defend in some case he is defense 2 not so bad. My idea Bilbo, Beravur and Denetor. I have song of the kings and Ministrels + sneak attack and strider path +steward of gondor and celebrian stone. + Lot of leadership allies. Working quite well. I draw all my deck in my hand in the first  10 turns. Threat ca go up to 40-45. After you have lot of allies in play,  Most powerfull enemies engage and snared already and 3 gandalf with 3 sneak attack in hand.\n\nThan you start to movie and quest like crazy by discarding card through protector of Lorien and play Gandalf every turn for reduce threat and help to kill enemies.

Next game again solo , same deck , very long and hard game and i win(also very interesting game).\n\nVerdict: The quest is interesting and game expirience is really different from 3 core sets.Scaling also better more players you have more dangerous encounter cards effects which is good but still game is to easy if you have expert 50 cards decks.\n\nReally there is same problems as with core set quests. To easy wtih 3 and more players and for expert decks. So i still wonder wnen we will get the quest which one will be manage to play against expert decks and more than 1 player????\n\nFor good game expirience play solo.

For now really not necessary to build up 50 cards (3copies cards) expert decks. If you build up this decks the game is to easy.\n\nThe best is play mono sphere decks for coop. In solo yes with good expert deck you win from 80% to 90% of game sessions.\n\nThe HFG difiicult level is 4. So according to this logic 5 and 6 difficult level will be ok for expert 50 cards decks and 8,9,10 (maybe up?)\n\nis ok for coop game expert decks.

There is so many ways how to make quest more interesting but looks like FFG want to make this game casual style.\n\nI also try to create Lotr community in my town and last week i manage to make a HFG event in our club.

My complains never was against the small card pool. And not against the game mechanic is briliant. Small card pool is not a problem my friend. Card pool will grow up with adv pack so is only matter of time. This third lotr card game for me for last 12 years.I use to play Middle earth ccg(really coo game) decipher lotr and now this FFG one.I passed with 2 previous game all circle, start , grow up and End(middle earth i play not much as decipher).So i have expirience about the cards game and i know what im talking about.\n\nMy problem with this game is : balance is very bad, scaling is awfull( HFG little bit change it), very stupid on my view victory points system(they take this idea from middle earth ccg but there is much more interesting) and  low difficult level.\n\nBalance can be fixx with erratas, rules adding, add adv pack , Scaling same way. But quests  as i sad before manage to be weak for now. I can accept it in core set cose is beginning. But HFG this is first Adv pack. Is show us the way which the game will grow.\n\nSo what is the main thing for this game????\n\nQuests and encounter cards. The quest is heart of the game. Very important. They should be done very interesting and hard. But now all of them done 50% power. Hope it will change. HFG is  good but not good enough.

Anduin is difficult 4. Hunt for Gollum also is difficult 4. But i suppose the Anduin quest is more hard.\n\nThe last stage on the Gollum quest is very easy if you compare with ambush on the last stage of Anduin. HFG much easy!!!\n\nIn HFG quest you must follow the golden rule: If you can travel than travel. Never keep more than 1 location on the staging area if possible.\n\nKeep this rule and you will win mostly.\n\nAnduin much more harder with troll on the first stage and long boat trip on the second.
