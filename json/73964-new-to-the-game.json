I don't think I have the money to go out and buy all the packs. Also I am not in to building super competitive decks only one that has a good theme and a fair chance of defeating the scenario. I would be more interested in the fun and theme of the expansions than in the goodness of the cards they contain. So which do you think I should buy if I'm just looking for some fun?

So which do you think I should buy if I'm just looking for some fun? also does this chang what you think about me getting the Hobbit\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nwell it doesnt change me recommending you not get the hobbit…..if you get it just after core the chances are you will not be able to win it for a very long time (not a reflection on your ability, its just desgined with the current card pool in mind) so i would not recommend buying that as unless you like loosing, it will be very frustrating\n\nthe reason it is so hard is that if you take a look at early enemies and locations and compare the to the hobbit enemies and locations, there is quite a difference in power….the cycle before hand had some great player cards in, so it needed to be rather harder than earlier packs\n\nwithout some of the key 'power cards' from earlier packs, you will quickly become overran by enemies and threat\n\nHFG is both fun and themeatic….i play this game mainly for theme and so on, and this is one of my favourites\n\nthere isnt really any packs that are best in  the sense that they will give you a good amount of powerful card….i think you will need at least 3 packs to get a decent card pool up and running\n\ncheck out cardgamedb.com to see which cards are in which packs\n\ni think the most fun ones in the mirkwood cycle are hunt for gollum, conflict at the carrock and the dead marshes\n\nif you want anymore advice just ask\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73964-new-to-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=725308","commentId":725308,"userName":"walkinstube","timestamp":1353266599,"content":"I think what I will do is just take it slowly and buy maybe one pack a month.
