So either it completely ruins a quest or instead completely ruins your day. Both are pretty terrible....\n\nI think that they more or less had to take it out of Nightmare Versions as it is a completely broken and extremely poorly designed card. It breaks two quests and makes a third way harder than it should be and already is.\n\n \n\nYeah I was exaggerating about Orc Vanguard, that card has just ruined my day and lost me a game on far too many occasions.... there is certainly worse but it is definitely pretty **** nasty. If you look at these hall of beorn search results 8 is literally the highest base attack any enemy has... \n\nhttp://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?cardType=Encounter&Attack=8&AttackOp=gteq [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Search?cardType=Encounter&Attack=8&AttackOp=gteq]\n\nNot only that but you are more or less forced to engage it as soon as it appears unless you are running mono tactics. I have had many games in which it appears during setup or the first round of staging and then has to be engaged so that it doesn't just completely shut both of my decks down. Then you not only have to contend with its 8 attack but also its fairly decent 3 armour and 5 hitpoints. Can't sneak attack it either. Feint and then quick dispatch of this foe is usually your best bet. \n\nI feel like maybe a competition similar to the Hero Championship but for most hated/most nasty encounter cards would perhaps be quite a fun exercise for the community.... hmmmm... "}]}
