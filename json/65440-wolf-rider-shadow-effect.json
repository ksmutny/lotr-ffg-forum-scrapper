When you have to resolve an additional attack, it still follows the 4 steps presented on p. 18 of the rules. This means that there is an action window between step 1 (choose the attacker, wolf rider in this case) and step 2 (declare defender). The Rider will be moved to the staging area then, which ends the attack. Its additional shadow card will not be resolved and discarded at the end of combat phase.\n\nReager said:\n\n \n\nIf this is legit, would he still go on top on the encounter deck after the compat phase?\n\n \n\nYes. After the shadow effect on Wolf Rider has been started to resolve (i.e. not having been cancelled via Hasty Stroke), there is no way of stopping the effect. So the Rider will be put back to the encounter deck.\n\n(There is one special exception - when you kill the Rider. This is because card effects (the Rider's shadow effect) don't deal with cards in an out-of-play-state (e.g. the killed Rider in the discard pile), unless they explicitly state so.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65440-wolf-rider-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=639671","commentId":639671,"userName":"Reager2","timestamp":1338705201,"content":" thanks, that's what I thought, just wanted to be sure because on BGG I got different answers saying quite the opposite but I wasn't really convinced\n\nlink to the bgg thread: http://boardgamegeek.com/article/9303743#9303743 [http://boardgamegeek.com/article/9303743#9303743]"}]}
