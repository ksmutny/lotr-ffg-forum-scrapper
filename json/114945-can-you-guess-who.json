I wouldn't consider Bilbo exactly  cheerful at that point though.\n\n- 1 for the gloomy who embrace death could only be Fall of Gil-Galad, though I would say the word \"embrace\" is a bit strong in this case. It certainly lessens the blow though.\n\n- Skipping ahead to the last one: 4 for the ones that are since the beginning... This would obviously be the 4 main songs from the first cycle, but honestly they are for more than just the heroes that came in the beginning.\n\n- 2 for the strong-willed... Sounds to me like this is talking about songs that boost willpower, though there is only one. In that case it could just be referring to the Spirit sphere, in which case it makes sense. One specifically helps other players, which goes for \"may they help others to find their way safe\", but I don't see how Lay of the Nimrodel really matches that description.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I could see this going either way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=1231268","commentId":1231268,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1409209512,"content":"Ah yes, I'm French and we didn't get O Lorien yet.... -_- [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sleep.png]  so sad.\n\n \n\nSkeez is right.\n\n \n\nLay of Nimrodel was a little short of helping other, but boosting quest in multiplayer help others in a way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114945-can-you-guess-who/?do=findComment&comment=1231754","commentId":1231754,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1409216191,"content":"Everybody likes me and all people want me to stay in game.
