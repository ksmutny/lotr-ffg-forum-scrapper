I would buy cards from FFG if they did that. They just print what people buy. As it is, I bought some singles from an online retailer to finish my set of uncommons and get three more Gandalfs. That way each deck can have some Gandalf love."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48551-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=487569","commentId":487569,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1308468279,"content":"Good fun read.

But maybe they will and then I'll be missing the point.\n\n\n\nI don't think that this timeframe will change. As in \"Middle Earth Quest\" this period was chosen for specific reasons:\n\na) It allows designers to develop and players to explore middle-earth during a time, where there is a certan freedom from the LotR-books, while you can still meet most of the important characters and give the illusion, that you are working towards the events in LotR.\nIf you set games is at the same time as the LotR, you either follow the main character, which means that you can only re-tell the original story, or you follow new, independent characters, which means, the actions of the players are diminished by those of the BIG ONES (Frodo and company). Both of these twp options have been done to death.\n\nb) I also assume, that it is a question of licensing. I guess, that the licensing agreement with the Tolkien estate specifically states, that FFG can only make games set in this period. But that is just a guess.\n\nOf course: Never say never, but I am quite sure that LotR:TCG will stay in this timeframe."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48551-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=487886","commentId":487886,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1308521746,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nMestrahd said:\n\n \n\nI think you answered your own question.

For most of them, if one was in play you couldn't play another one, but for some it meant you could play the new one and the old one had to be discarded. So you could replace Strider with Aragorn, and if your opponent had The Mouth in play as a character you could play the Mouth of Sauron hazard card to force him to take The Mouth back to his hand.\n\nIt's not that difficult to include different versions of the same character in a game.\n\n "}]}
