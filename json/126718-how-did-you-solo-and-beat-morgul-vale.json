Obviously, some are a lot tougher than others. I had a bugger of a time soloing this quest! I could not figure it out and so I broke. I actually went online searching for single deck builds that could beat it. I've never had to do that before. I just prefer to beat a mission first before I troll around and figure out how other folks have done it.\n\nI found Glaurung's (sp?) Dunhere, Frodo, and Merry build and I still couldn't beat it. First off, hats off to Glau for designing a fun deck! I could never get as lucky as he did with card draw in the video. Has anyone been able to solo one deck it with a different set of heroes? I came close a couple times but would get that stupid treachery that shuffles the captain back into the deck and then the captain would always come out as a shadow card.\n\nI then modified the build. Replaced Northern Tracker with Elfhelm to get more chance of card draw with hobbit pipe. Worked in Rohan Warhorse and Free to Choose came in clutch a couple times.\n\nSo, I'm just wondering what solo one deck build you used?\n\nEdited November 9, 2014 by X_BryGuy_X"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126718-how-did-you-solo-and-beat-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=1328023","commentId":1328023,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1415555686,"content":"...but hobbit pipe only triggers on events..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126718-how-did-you-solo-and-beat-morgul-vale/?do=findComment&comment=1328029","commentId":1328029,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1415556193,"content":"My elves deck laughs at Morgul Vale.

Another key is that none of the stages rewards you for over-questing, so you want to pay close attention to who you have assigned to the quest and hold back your best combat heroes for the fighting. Combat control cards like Feint and Quick Strike are also very useful, as the first two bosses have forced effects that can get out of hand very quickly. In short, you want to be able to kill the first two bosses the round that you engage them, and have alternate sources of damage so that it doesn't take forever to kill the Nazgûl. Staging area attack can do quite well in this quest, assuming you also bring enough willpower to avoid staging area lock, and some threat-control to avoid engagements."}]}
