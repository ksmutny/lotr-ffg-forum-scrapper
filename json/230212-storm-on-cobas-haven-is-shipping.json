The Dwarven Rings might not appear because we know they were lost at the time of the books, but it'd be a reasonable strech for a card game to go there, as they have done already several theme breaks and inconsistencies which we're totally fine with because this is a card game, not the novels. And even if we don't get the Last of the Seven, there were several Lesser Rings in existence in Middle Earth during the time of the novels. Even in the podcasts the developers have mentioned them and they have quoted them in the game for years (back of the box of Celebrimbor's Secret, Elven Jeweler). \n\n \n\nI stand fast by my opinion that the game has so far neglected without any good reason the themes of powerful/dangerous Artifacts in Tolkien's writings, which happens to be one of his chiefest themes when we consider artifice and the corruption it entails as our world's technology and scientific advancement. There's a reason both Sauron and Saruman were Maiar of Aule before they turned evil, and yes, the Elves and Men dabbled with these Arts with stuff like the Rings and the Palatiri (not to mention the Silmarils), hence I think there should be a portion of the player card pool that did as well.\n\n \n\nAnyway, I think they should revisit these themes, as they already began exploring them in the Voice of Isengard box with stuff like Keys of Orthanc, The Seeing-stone and ally Saruman. So saying that the developers have some sort of problem with or want to avoid these themes isn't really true. To me it's more like they don't particularly care about it, when they should.\n\nEdited September 16, 2016 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230212-storm-on-cobas-haven-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2418314","commentId":2418314,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1474080537,"content":"we have the three elven rings now with The Grey Havens, and the Ring of Barahir (not one of the rings crafted by Celebrimbor, but a ring nontheless), and The One Ring is in the saga (which is where it should be, imo)\n\n \n\nwe also have Celebrian's Stone\n\n \n\ni would like to see more lore-related artefacts in general.  i don't think it's necessarily a critique of how much the game has or has not included of them, but the player card pool is actually quite small compared to other games, especially for how long this game has been out."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230212-storm-on-cobas-haven-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2418326","commentId":2418326,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1474081099,"content":"We also have two Palantir (saga and non-saga), the Arkenstone and in The Ruins of Belegost there are a handful of fantastic lore-related artifacts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230212-storm-on-cobas-haven-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2418650","commentId":2418650,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1474121837,"content":"also Durin's axe and, well, two pieces of his armour (or is it three cos the boots count as two?)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230212-storm-on-cobas-haven-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2418734","commentId":2418734,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1474128300,"content":"I am aware of the Treasure and Boon cards, but to me, they just plain don't count.

I still just think it would be cool to get some of the lesser rings. And Thrain's Ring (or was it Thror's?) can have the same restriction of attaching to a particularly-named character only. And since the Seven didn't corrupt the dwarves to evil, just augmented their natural greed -- \"it needs gold to breed gold\" -- it could have an ability like Gaining Strength, exhaust the Ring and discard 2 resources from attached hero's resource pool to add 3 resources.\n\nThere's also design space for minor rings of power. They don't need a crazy ability like the Three, but still something more powerful than the Dunedain Signal stat boosts. A weak Asfaloth-like ability. Exhaust to place 1 progress on a location in the staging area. Or a Feint-like ability that requires you to fetch another enemy and engage it, so you can dodge a powerful attack at the expense of still having to defend a weaker one. Maybe a discard fetching, shuffle the top card into your deck. Or how about a tutoring ability, Doomed 1 to swap a card in hand with a card from the top 3 of your deck (shuffling first to prevent Stargazing). I think smaller abilities, and ones with worse costs, could still be practical.\n\nAnd we do have a Palantir that represents decently the theme of using one, but realistically the card kind of sucks for gameplay."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230212-storm-on-cobas-haven-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2420709","commentId":2420709,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1474295707,"content":"I'm sorry Derek, but I respectfully disagree. Having Lesser Rings would \"point us towards the events of the text\"? And what's wrong with that? How about all the Eagles and Ents we've had in the cycles and not in the sagas, the only time when those factions did anything? Those guys did nothing and stood back during the 17 year gap and yet we can still bring Treebeard to fight at the Fords of Isen or Gwaihir to the Morgul Vale. I'm sorry, but that doesn't convince me. \n\n \n\nThe whole point of the game is to ask \"what if\"? \"What if Beorn went on the quest?\" as Caleb himself says in the Team Covenant Black Riders video. You say Lesser Rings would be too much to handle for the game? I think you're involuntarily insulting the developers with that claim. Of course they could handle it, just like they've handled everything else. You say Artifact related themes should be restricted to Encounter cards? Then Caleb&Matt clearly made a mistake when making The Seeing-Stone and Keys of Orthanc, and the whole Doomed mechanic, because the whole point of that was to slap an Encounter keyword on player cards to represent the shady stuff. We're getting Haradrim allies/heroes next cycle, allies and heroes we could bring to Arnor if we want to. Is it too much of a stretch to think Glorfindel might have had a minor elven ring on his finger during his travels?\n\n \n\nThis game is THE chance for the players and creators to go all out and really explore Middle Earth. Thematic concessions must happen. Sure, we'll hopefully never see something as an Orc hero or ally, but never seeing more Lesser Rings or Palantiri because they're too risky? Come on.

They should be rare, only represented in a smattering of player cards. They shouldn't ever be as well developed as other themes in player cards because that would make them far more present than they ever were in the time-frame of Lord of the Rings.\n\nI'm really pleased that we got the Three Rings, that we got the Doomed cards, Saruman, hero Gandalf, Gandalf's Staff, and a couple of spells.

On the other hand, I don't think I'd be so pleased if we ever got enough artifacts and magic that you could build a deck entirely around them, because then they wouldn't feel as special and rare as they should. As such, while I'll be excited any time they do spoil a card following those themes, it's certainly not something I'm really looking for every time spoilers appear, because it's not something I really expect to be touched on more than maybe once or twice per cycle.\n\n \n\nBeyond the things I specifically mentioned, I would certainly like a better version of Radagast, maybe the Blue Wizards (though I know there are potential rights issues there). I wouldn't mind a Lesser Ring, but I'd be hesitant about the idea of more than one - unless perhaps they were all unique so you'd have to pick one rather than using them all at once. I don't ever expect another Palantir (and the existing one is nowhere near as bad as people think it is) - it's not an aspect of the lore I'm particularly familiar with, is there a reason why the different Palantiri should behave differently to each other?\n\n \n\nI suppose what I'm getting at in short is that while I'd like to see a little bit more magic in the game, I would stop well short of asking for the rods of the Five Wizards, the Keys of Barad-Dur itself, and a pair of boots much larger than the ones I currently wear. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] (No disrespect meant to your pov, the line just fit too well not to use it)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230212-storm-on-cobas-haven-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2420857","commentId":2420857,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1474301867,"content":"> We need more rings in general.

I myself have a fascination with this aspect of Tolkien's writings, I admit, and one that is not shared by most people. If they decided to go all out and make a whole theme of cards enough to make an Artifact deck I wouldn't obviously mind, but I too think it'll never happen. In fact I'd be totally content with just 1 card called Lesser Ring and, as you said: \"Saruman, Saruman's Ring and Staff, and maybe one or two other bits\". Just that alone would be enough for me.\n\n \n\nRegarding the Palantiri, I don't think it's so much about the objects themselves being very different as much as there being design space for 3 different cards being unjustly reduced to 1. Just knowing that one Palantir was held by Saruman, the other by Denethor and the other by the Elves of the White Towers suggests so many possibilities as to what each could do. For instance, the Palantir of Elostirion could not communicate with the others, being only able to look West across the Sea and get a glimpse of Aman. How amazing would it be if we got a card for that Palantir and giving it a discard Noldor ability or a Light of Valinor type ability? Instead we only have 1 Palantir card. It's about the design space being wasted more than anything else.\n\n \n\nIt's the same thing that happens with, say, spears in this game. Sure, maybe a Spear of the Mark and an Elven Spear aren't too different in terms of function, but it would have been rather boring if we got a single, generic \"Spear\" card as opposed to different spears that worked off of the mechanics of those traits (namely, staging area attack and discard). Same thing with the Palantir.\n\nEdited September 19, 2016 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230212-storm-on-cobas-haven-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2420895","commentId":2420895,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1474302416,"content":">  \n> \n> > We need more rings in general.

Having Lesser Rings would \"point us towards the events of the text\"? And what's wrong with that? How about all the Eagles and Ents we've had in the cycles and not in the sagas, the only time when those factions did anything? Those guys did nothing and stood back during the 17 year gap and yet we can still bring Treebeard to fight at the Fords of Isen or Gwaihir to the Morgul Vale.

You say Lesser Rings would be too much to handle for the game? I think you're involuntarily insulting the developers with that claim. Of course they could handle it, just like they've handled everything else. You say Artifact related themes should be restricted to Encounter cards? Then Caleb&Matt clearly made a mistake when making The Seeing-Stone and Keys of Orthanc, and the whole Doomed mechanic, because the whole point of that was to slap an Encounter keyword on player cards to represent the shady stuff. We're getting Haradrim allies/heroes next cycle, allies and heroes we could bring to Arnor if we want to. Is it too much of a stretch to think Glorfindel might have had a minor elven ring on his finger during his travels?\n> \n>  \n> \n> This game is THE chance for the players and creators to go all out and really explore Middle Earth. Thematic concessions must happen. Sure, we'll hopefully never see something as an Orc hero or ally, but never seeing more Lesser Rings or Palantiri because they're too risky? Come on. The whole point of the game is to encyclopedically explore Middle Earth, and what you're arguing is just restrictive to that goal.\n\n \n\nWow. I appreciate your passion for the game. \n\n \n\nAllow me to try and further explain myself: a big \"what if\" would be \"what if they found ring X\". That is a topic more worthy of storytelling than a new avenue of mechanical usage. That's my point when I say I think it would better be handled by encounter cards. Rings become less special the more of them they are. \n\n \n\nAnd my short-sightedness or lack of imagination for new game mechanics is not an insult to the devs. Thanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230212-storm-on-cobas-haven-is-shipping/?do=findComment&comment=2421361","commentId":2421361,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1474312590,"content":"Well, I would certainly love a quest centered around the heroes searching for a Lesser Ring or Palantiri, so no argument there.

I mean, there's a fair number of people who defend the Palantir card as being enjoyable, and it IS an interesting card, but to me it's not that powerful or enjoyable, that's why I think it's currently being played mostly in experimental/jank decks. It is a starting point, I'll give it that. I think so much could be done with them as a theme, as I said, there are 3 different Palantiri that could be made. \n\nEdited September 19, 2016 by Gizlivadi"}]}
