I know that print on demand cards may have slightly different back colours, so......\n\nWhat type of sleeves are okay for tournement play?\n\nObviously the backs need to be opaque, so....\n\nSingle colour backs okay for the different decks, clear for quests.\n\nThe reason I ask is that my local store doesn't have enough art backs for me to do the base box set.\n\nHopefully an answer will come before I pop out to the store.\n\nAll the best.\n\nRichard"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/173992-tournament-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=1591113","commentId":1591113,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1429873573,"content":"Single colour are fine.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/173992-tournament-sleeves/?do=findComment&comment=1591118","commentId":1591118,"userName":"paganeagle2001","timestamp":1429874000,"content":"Thank you, that makes it a lot easier.\n\nAll the best.\n\nRichard"}]}
