The next cycle will work off of the Hobbit deluxe box, like we're used to.\n\n2. The next cycle will work off of a new, not yet revealed deluxe box.\n\n3. The next cycle will work independently, with just it's own cards, or using encounter sets from the core set.\n\n \n\nDo we know yet for sure if both Hobbit deluxe boxes are coming this year?

I have no clue, lol.\n\nWe should be finding out soon enough though. It seems like we're just about due for a news article revealing the next cycle.
