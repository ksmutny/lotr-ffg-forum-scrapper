Can they use this to attack an enemy engaged with another player?  And I'm also guessing that using this on Dunhere still allows you to use him to attack enemies in the staging area, right? \n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73387-sorry-another-dumb-question%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=715649","commentId":715649,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1351353306,"content":"i believe (and id wait for conformation on this) that quick strike can\n\n-let you attack with an enemy engaged with you, or in dunheres case in the staging area\n\n-but not with ranged (ignore this…see below)\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73387-sorry-another-dumb-question%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=715651","commentId":715651,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1351354017,"content":" I can understand and totally agree with the first half part, Rich, but…what do you mean by \" not with ranged\" ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73387-sorry-another-dumb-question%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=715653","commentId":715653,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1351354743,"content":"Cutievalkyrie said:\n\n \n\n I can understand and totally agree with the first half part, Rich, but…what do you mean by \" not with ranged\" ?\n\n \n\n \n\ni see that was probably ambigous- what i meant was that i think quick strike cant work on a character attacking an enemy engaged with another player with ranged…i think it was clarified a while back, but ill check\n\nrich\n\nEDIT- aparently im wrong…(still getting the hang of multi player rules haha) heres thanks to daniel b of BBG\n\nIn 1.11 of the latest FAQ there is an example implying that other players' ranged characters may participate in an attack initiated by Quick Strike.

One character is exhausted to pay for the cost of Quick Strike, and the effect is that the exhausted character is immediately declared as an attacker against the target enemy. The card's resolution does not allow for a standard declaration step in which other characters can declare.\n\nSo in effect, option 1 of the above quoted is the correct interpretation now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73387-sorry-another-dumb-question%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=715708","commentId":715708,"userName":"Cutievalkyrie","timestamp":1351375897,"content":"Now it is clear, but can i use 2 or more quick attacks on different characters and make them attack 1 enemy together?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/73387-sorry-another-dumb-question%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=715726","commentId":715726,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1351385294,"content":"Ohhh.
