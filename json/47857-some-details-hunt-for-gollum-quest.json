This word is worst part of the pictures to understand.\n\nIf you sure ok. But is weird than!!!  You succesfully questing + you can discard a nasty card.Good bonus!!! But anyway you have additional card almost every turn and get it before engagement. But sounds promising anyway.\n\nWhen we will get this pack in our hand???In the end of June i hope?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47857-some-details-hunt-for-gollum-quest/?do=findComment&comment=480356","commentId":480356,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1307233188,"content":"Well the point is that we can search for the Clues that Gollum is leaving around. I'm liking that mechanic, and the picture on the card is great! (Aragorn I think, hunting for Gollum).
