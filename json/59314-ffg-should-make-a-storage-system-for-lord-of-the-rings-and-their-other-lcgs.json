It \"seams\" cool.. but all it dose is restrict the way you do your table. Like will this playmate have enough space for all the encounter cards that may come out? How about victory piles.. do you use the same \"shape\" for solo and 2 player and 3 player? Will the hero area have enough space for 500 billion attachments on a single card?\n\nAll playmates do is make it harder to play the game"}]}
