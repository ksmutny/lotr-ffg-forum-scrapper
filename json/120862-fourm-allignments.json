Fair enough. But what would be \"good\" according to you? Being nice? Answering newbie questions? What makes richsabre good and what makes Dan neutral?  They're both equally good to me, maybe Dan is even \"better\" since he contributes so much to the community with Blog/podcast/card search, but at the same time I find Rich more of an optimist and someone who has more fun... Also how is Tracker1 chaotic?\n\n \n\nAnyway, I'm clearly looking too deep into it, but nevertheless it's a fun game!\n\n \n\nAlso, I'd like to see one of these using the spheres of influence.\n\nEdited September 1, 2014 by Gizlivadi"}]}
