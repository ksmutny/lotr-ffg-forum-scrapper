Is the card removed from the game? If so, that is a pretty sad result. Allies and attachments cannot remain in play with this card effect then and thus you cannot make a \"before I'm eliminated\" pass."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/306850-message-from-elrond-player-elimination/?do=findComment&comment=3913807","commentId":3913807,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1584143837,"content":"I got a ruling from Caleb once about the Forced effect on a Curious Brandybuck that triggered after its owner had been eliminated, but was under another player's control. The answer was, the Brandybuck is removed from the game.
