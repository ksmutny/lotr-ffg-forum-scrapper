Dwarves are also helped by Untroubled by Darkness.\n \n\nWith that said, Visionary Leadership in a Gondor deck with Faramir is a reliable way to beat the quest. Get some readying effects on Faramir to trigger him multiple times per phase to make sure all allies are boosted several times in order to shield them from the snow, and allow you to make some good progress.\n\nFor more tips, see this older strategy article I made a while back: https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/02/18/the-redhorn-gate/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/02/18/the-redhorn-gate/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/299440-redhorn-gate-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=3774329","commentId":3774329,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1567167100,"content":"If you’re in progression mode, I’d go with a Dwarf deck.
