I really like the idea of the Fallen heroes, it goes really well with Tolkien lore. The Fell Rider seems really nasty and that's only 1 of the 9.

Mostly i play only one game. Like ME ccg before Lotr tcg and now Lotr lcg. So i have all product which is release for today and will buy all new product as well. I really serious about this game is my favorite.\n\nAnd good critics to designers only make it better.\n\nBut i must to say they make a good job for now.  I love idea of Compaigh and easy normal Nighmare mode but......what i dont like : we get easy and normal straight away and need to wait for nightmare for years after!"}]}
