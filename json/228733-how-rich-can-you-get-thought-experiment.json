What is the maximum number of resources you can accrue on one hero by the end of your first planning phase?\n\nConditions:\n\n- You are playing in true solo mode.\n- You are playing with a tournament-legal deck of >=50 cards.\n- The composition and initial order of your deck can be anything you wish. This is also true for post-shuffling orders.\n- If relevant, the order of the encounter deck can also be anything you wish, even after shuffling.\n- You can only use cards already released as of 8/27/16 (no Justice Shall Be Done!)\n \n\nI can get 28 resources onto one hero by the end of the RESOURCE phase, but it seems improvable, especially if you let the planning phase come into play.

Drop two Sellswords, AVGT into two record-keepers and three Hidden Caches, AVGT into the last Sellsword and Record-keeper and three Ered Luin Prospectors, AVGT into two Zigil Miners, Mine for four resources, drop Lure of Moria, We Are Not Idle for fourteen, repeat. Then, drop Song of Travel, shuffle your deck back with Will of the West, and repeat, this time for 20 per Idle. Then Will of the West and repeat again, this time for 26 per Idle. Then Will of the West and repeat a fourth time for 32 per Idle. All assuming you haven't hard-cast any other dwarves in the meantime, (they'll quickly pay for themselves if you do. In the current card pool, Idle tops out at 59 resources per play, by my quick count.)\n\nFor draw, Taking Initiative works your first time through, Deep Knowledge is useful each time through (until it threats you out), and Steward + Rod eventually lets you draw through your deck at will, (since average resources gained per card drawn far exceeds 2). It might even be worth it to include bunches of recursion to get more then three Idles per trip through the deck.\n\nWith optimization, this should break 200 without really trying, and I suspect 500 would be within reach. I would not even be completely surprised if someone figured out a way to get all the way to 1000. At 50 resources per Idle, that would be 20 plays, or an average of five per trip through the deck. Tome of Atanatar + Second Breakfast could get you 15 plays in one trip alone, though in terms of global readies you'd top out at 9."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228733-how-rich-can-you-get-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=2388597","commentId":2388597,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1472392658,"content":"Note that a good chunk of the above can also be done purely in the Resource phase with Sneak Attacks and A Good Harvest, so, bravo, sir. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228733-how-rich-can-you-get-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=2388704","commentId":2388704,"userName":"Some Sort","timestamp":1472400897,"content":"Alright, so I figured I'd sit down and see what I could do if I optimized.

Grim Resolve (-5) + Tome of Atanatar (-3) into We Are Not Idle. DO NOT EXHAUST ALLY BOFUR ON THIS IDLE. (+61). 305 resources.\n\nRod Steward (-6) to draw 3x Second Breakfast. Pull back all three Tomes of Atanatar (-3). 296 resources.\n\nExhaust Bofur to search for a weapon. Shuffle your library to get your Idles back to the top.\n\nRod of the Steward (-2) to draw 1x Idle. Tome (-3) into Lure of Moria (-3). We Are Not Idle (+62). Draw another Idle. 352 resources.\n\nRod Steward (-2) into Galadhrim Weaver (-1) to shuffle that last Idle to the top of your library. 349 resources.\n\nTome (-3) into Lure of Moria (-3). Bofur to shuffle those two Lures back towards the top of your library. We Are Not Idle (+61). Draw another Idle. 404 resources.\n\nRod Steward (-2) into Lure of Moria (-3) into We Are Not Idle (+62). Draw the last Idle in your deck. 461 resources.\n\nRod Steward (-2) into your last Lure of Moria (-3) into your last We Are Not Idle (+62). Draw a Born Aloft. 518 resources.\n\nBorn Aloft a Hammersmith. Play your last Tome of Atanatar (-3) and use it to play another Lure of Moria (-3). Play your Hammersmith to recur the Tome of Atanatar (-2) and draw a card (another Born Aloft). Use the We Are Not Idle in your hand (+62). 572 resources.\n\n \n\nI'm kind of running out of steam here, but you can see how it goes. Lure of Moria or Grim Resolve + We Are Not Idle for 50+ resources a pop. Tome of Atanatar to recur your Idles and Lures, with Bofur to shuffle them back to the top for a third play. (Your Very Good Tales can also handle shuffling duties, as well as flipping some more Hidden Caches). Erebor Hammersmith to recur your Tomes, with Born Aloft to recur your Hammersmiths. Galadhrim Weaver to recur your Tomes again, with Tree People, Island Amid Perils, and Pursuing the Enemy to recur your Weavers, and Dwarven Tomb / Map of Earnil to recur your Island Amid Perils another nine times. Rod of the Steward to handle any draw you might need in between. Then, when you run out of recursion, drop a Will of the West and repeat. Then drop your last Will of the West and repeat again.\n\n \n\nBy my quick count, you can recur the Tome 3x (Hammersmith), +3x (Born Aloft > Hammersmith), +3x (Weaver), +3x (Island Amid Perils > Weaver), +6x (Map of Earnil > Island Amid Perils > Weaver), +12x (Dwarven Tomb > Map of Earnil > Island Amid Perils > Weaver), or 30 times, plus the three times you can play it originally, so 33 total. Each play of Tome of Atanatar gets you two more plays of Idle or Lure of Moria, plus the three original plays you get of each, for 36. Each Lure/Idle gets you 50+ resources, (depending on how much you had to spend to enable it), so a perfectly optimized run through the deck should be netting you more than 1500 resources. With a minimum of three runs through the deck (assuming you spend the entire first run just getting set up), I think you really should be able to push 5,000 total resources on a single hero by the end of the first planning phase. Which ain't too shabby.\n\n \n\nNote: I realize I forgot to account for the resource cost of the Song of Battle, but that's easily fixed by working a Legacy of Numenor somewhere before in the sequence. Basic principle remains the same."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228733-how-rich-can-you-get-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=2388708","commentId":2388708,"userName":"Some Sort","timestamp":1472401143,"content":"Crap, after posting I realized I forgot about Second Breakfast.

Lure of Moria or Grim Resolve + We Are Not Idle for 50+ resources a pop. Tome of Atanatar to recur your Idles and Lures, with Bofur to shuffle them back to the top for a third play. (Your Very Good Tales can also handle shuffling duties, as well as flipping some more Hidden Caches). Erebor Hammersmith to recur your Tomes, with Born Aloft to recur your Hammersmiths. Galadhrim Weaver to recur your Tomes again, with Tree People, Island Amid Perils, and Pursuing the Enemy to recur your Weavers, and Dwarven Tomb / Map of Earnil to recur your Island Amid Perils another nine times. Rod of the Steward to handle any draw you might need in between. Then, when you run out of recursion, drop a Will of the West and repeat. Then drop your last Will of the West and repeat again.\n> \n>  \n> \n> By my quick count, you can recur the Tome 3x (Hammersmith), +3x (Born Aloft > Hammersmith), +3x (Weaver), +3x (Island Amid Perils > Weaver), +6x (Map of Earnil > Island Amid Perils > Weaver), +12x (Dwarven Tomb > Map of Earnil > Island Amid Perils > Weaver), or 30 times, plus the three times you can play it originally, so 33 total. Each play of Tome of Atanatar gets you two more plays of Idle or Lure of Moria, plus the three original plays you get of each, for 36. Each Lure/Idle gets you 50+ resources, (depending on how much you had to spend to enable it), so a perfectly optimized run through the deck should be netting you more than 1500 resources. With a minimum of three runs through the deck (assuming you spend the entire first run just getting set up), I think you really should be able to push 5,000 total resources on a single hero by the end of the first planning phase. Which ain't too shabby.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Note: I realize I forgot to account for the resource cost of the Song of Battle, but that's easily fixed by working a Legacy of Numenor somewhere before in the sequence. Basic principle remains the same.\n\nLOL"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/228733-how-rich-can-you-get-thought-experiment/?do=findComment&comment=2390697","commentId":2390697,"userName":"Benoit Poulin","timestamp":1472506163,"content":"...
