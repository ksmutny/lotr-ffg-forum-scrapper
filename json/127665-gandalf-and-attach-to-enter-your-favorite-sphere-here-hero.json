I think the title of the topic is clear enough... When playing attachments which can be attached only on heroes belonging to a specific sphere, (such as \"a burning brand\", or \"Support of the eagles\") I guess they can be played on Gandalf as they are played from the top of library. I am right ? Because while, playing them, Gandalf has de matching sphere.\n\nÂ \n\nThe second issue is. When Gandalf loses the sphere... the attachment stays, or it is discarded ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127665-gandalf-and-attach-to-enter-your-favorite-sphere-here-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1344027","commentId":1344027,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1416764391,"content":"i think Gandalf can attach Burning Brand when he uses his ability.
