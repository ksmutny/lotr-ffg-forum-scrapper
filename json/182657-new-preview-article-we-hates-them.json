I know some (few but still) players are more excited about the quest than the player cards in the previews but I always find the spoilt encounters to be only take out of the context. Then there is the mechanics, though.\n\n \n\nSo yeah, I missed the part that the new heroes be all rangers. And by all, I think it is safe to assume there will be just two. Still, two is okay. One is Faramir, and I am sure hoping he will be Leadership. The other I am guessing Damrod and Lore (the Spirit ally being rather underwhelming, except the great art).\n\n \n\nps: Now I see you guys above are saying similar things. Do not think I am just copying you, haha."}]}
