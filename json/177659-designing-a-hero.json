Well, you can, but it won't serve the purpose. To declare an attack against an enemy engaged with another player, a character must already have Ranged. Without Ranged, you simply won't be able to declare them as attackers to reap the benefit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177659-designing-a-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1634156","commentId":1634156,"userName":"OlorinCZ","timestamp":1432454297,"content":"I know I would not work with this wording, but you get my idea.

I agree the Ranger/Trap archetype could use something more like it, though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/177659-designing-a-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1634586","commentId":1634586,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1432499471,"content":"Faramir\n\n \n\n2/3/2/5\n\n \n\nGondor.
