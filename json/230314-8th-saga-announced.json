It allows me to focus on digesting the already huge amount of \"new\" content that I have. To be honest, I think that FFG is a little bit trigger happy on the spoilers and news. It's kind of crazy that we know what the 2nd pack of the Haradrim cycle is and we are just over halfway through Dreamcatcher cycle! \n\n\nAlmost a full deluxe and and chapter cycle ahead on news as it stands."}]}
