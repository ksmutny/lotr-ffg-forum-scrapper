It does not get placed in the staging area.\n\nIf a card has surge, you immediately reveal another card and add it to the staging necessary as appropriate. Example: If you are playing a 2 player game and you reveal 1 card while questing, that card has surge. You immediately reveal a second card. Then you reveal the second card as normal (so there are now 3 cards instead of the usual 2)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59528-starting-questions/?do=findComment&comment=584721","commentId":584721,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1327500676,"content":" page 6 + page 24"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59528-starting-questions/?do=findComment&comment=584772","commentId":584772,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1327509202,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n page 6 + page 24\n\n\n\n \n\n\"Teach a man to fish...\" :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59528-starting-questions/?do=findComment&comment=585038","commentId":585038,"userName":"crwiths","timestamp":1327571550,"content":"So what do you do with Old Wives Tales from the Hunt for Gollum?  Would each hero lose a resource at the start of turn 1?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59528-starting-questions/?do=findComment&comment=585042","commentId":585042,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327572543,"content":"crwiths said:\n\n \n\nSo what do you do with Old Wives Tales from the Hunt for Gollum?  Would each hero lose a resource at the start of turn 1?\n\n \n\n \n\nif you are talking about drawing it as a set up card, well seeing as they do not have resources yet they all would have to eshaust\n\ni assume thats what you meant. so you draw your 6 cards, then flip the quest to when revealed- reveal old wives tales, then seeing as th resource phase hasnt happened you wouldnt have any resources"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59528-starting-questions/?do=findComment&comment=585053","commentId":585053,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1327573228,"content":" page 10 + page 11"}]}
