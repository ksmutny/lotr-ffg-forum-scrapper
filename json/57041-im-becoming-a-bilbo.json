I think of myself as a 50% Pippin, 40% Bilbo, and 10% Boromir type of gamer. When I first get a game this doesn't show up right away, as I like to get a solid footing underneath me, win a few, get comfortable with the game mechanics... but then, not too long in to building familiarity, the curiosity factor from the Pippin in me and the love for a good theme from the Bilbo in me start to kick in. And this is exactly what keeps this particular game feeling so replayable. The fun isn't done once I've beaten a particular quest. Not by a long shot. The question then quickly starts to become more about the \"how I got there\" than the actual end result. There are so many different paths to take.

You can actually get up to a 45-card deck, but it's still missing a third hero (only Legolas and Eleanor at the moment). Yes, that means three copies of Nor Am I A Stranger and Second Breakfast. Yes, that means playing Legolas without any other Tactics cards, but you also get fatties like Elfhelm, Gildor Inglorion, and Haldir. Plus, she illustrated Song of Wisdom, so you'll even be able to use all of the Lore cards!\n\nThe only downside is that turns start to take a really long time as you admire the art happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57041-im-becoming-a-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=563479","commentId":563479,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1322942849,"content":"I <3 this thread..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57041-im-becoming-a-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=563586","commentId":563586,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1322979753,"content":"Well, I've built my 'Bilbo & The Elves' deck now and successfully taken them through Mirkwood a couple of times.  The deck certainly needs a lot of things to go right for it to win, but it's been a lot of fun because of the theme.\n\nIt's Lore/Tactics with Spirit splashed in.  Mainly a Silvan deck - Legolas calling in the Elves to aid the party, with Bilbo singing merry songs to assist the party. \n\nGetting the Spirit cards out is obviously reliant on getting Song of Travel, but they can usually be burned with Protector of Lorien if I find myself not able to play them.\n\nA nice little combo that came out was Bilbo having Song of Mocking to shunt damage across to Legolas who would get healed at the end of the round by a Silvan Tracker.\n\nHeroes:  Bilbo Baggins, Berevor, Legolas\n\nCards:\n\nForest Snare x 3\n\nProtector of Lorien x 3\n\nSecret Paths x 3\n\nFast Hitch x 3\n\nHenmarth Riversong x 3\n\nSilvan Tracker x 3\n\nDaughter of the Nimrodel x 3\n\nHaldir of Lorien x 3\n\nA Burning Brand x 3\n\nBlade of Gondolin x 3\n\nSong of Mocking x 3\n\nSong of Travel x 3\n\nSong of Wisdom x 3\n\nUnexpected Courage x 2\n\nThe Galadhrim's Greeting x 2\n\nHasty Stroke x 2\n\nA Test of Will x 3\n\nLorien Guide x 2\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57041-im-becoming-a-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=563655","commentId":563655,"userName":"Vase","timestamp":1322996867,"content":" Does someone have the link to this article that explains the player types?\n\n \n\nIf not, can someone summarize it here?  I'm interested to see what player type I am..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57041-im-becoming-a-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=563660","commentId":563660,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1322997442,"content":"Here's the article: javascript:void(0);/*1323018934348*/ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2296] \n\nIn short: Bilbo=thematic player, Pippin=lover of quirky combos and strange card interactions, and Boromir=power gamer (i.e., win at all costs).\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57041-im-becoming-a-bilbo/?do=findComment&comment=563661","commentId":563661,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1322997530,"content":"here ya go http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2296 [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2296]\n\n \n\n(got beat to it :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png])"}]}
