Apart from a couple of interchangables depending on location or enemy faced, there's just \"the deck\". Maybe I missed some cards I initially dismissed as \"totally crappy\".

FFG introduced \"easy mode\" so people could play thematic decks (as in bad decks) to try and inject some theme. They also made the tribes very strong so when you build a deck it is cohesive.. this means all the cards are grouped and the deck feels more thematic.\n\nThe problem with tribal decks, not in this game but in all games, is that you are basically getting restricted to the decks provided for us form FFG, the tribes with such a small pool are practically pre-constructed decks. LoTR has a tiny card pool as it is, and each pack adds nearly 1/2 the cards that other LCGs get so it grows very slow. Meaning we have few deck choices as it is. Every deck posted has been made by other players, there is no originality in this game. Part of that, imo, is the heavy reliance on tribes as a artificial way to generate theme.\n\nEdited February 3, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97494-a-cry-for-more-universal-cards/?do=findComment&comment=972325","commentId":972325,"userName":"Nizi","timestamp":1391416189,"content":"> Have I misinterpreted you?\n\n \n\nMaybe a little. Even when solo-playing, I generally play two decks because a single feels limited. I actually meant exactly what booored says: cards are often trait-based and thus are useless in a trait-less deck. I get that you can't just have a deck using \"the best cards\", but now you're just using the deck they want you to use if you want to retain maximum value of a certain card. If you choose not to, they turn into vanilla cards that are not fun to play with.\n\n \n\nI don't care whether the game loses its 'thematic' effect.

In the end, the game is way different than other LCG's in the sense that the focal point of it is the adventures/quests. Your deck should always be optimised for the quest you're actually doing, and not for internal consistency like other cardgames. We know what we're up against. Gameplanning is functional to the quests. This demands some traits-based cards. I tried the approach of just making a balanced consistent deck and running it through all the adventures like a story, but the game forces you to make certain changes.

A famous one for this game is Eagels flying down tunnels in the mines of moria with spears attached to them and stuff.

The Heroes are the main focus of a deck and in most cases the most powerful and to that end attachments are a huge part of this game. Many top decks have few and some no allies at all. Admittedly Dwalves and Outlands encouraged mass allies but these were recent additions and unusual when they turned up.\n\nSo while I agree about cards that require other cards to be inefficient, it is also how this game is designed.. so in THIS game it is not inefficient, as a attachment on a hero allowing you to do something is much more powerful than most other cards you can cast.\n\nOn a side note if you are looking for a great game to replace MTG.. take a look at Call of Cthulhu LCG.. best deck construction game ever made!\n\n\n\n> it presupposes possession of certain cards.\n\nabsolutely true and one of the reasons this game has crazy card draw abilities and no maximum hand size, so the \"tools\" so to speak of the deck can all get into play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97494-a-cry-for-more-universal-cards/?do=findComment&comment=972446","commentId":972446,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1391432218,"content":">  \n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> I don't care whether the game loses its 'thematic' effect.

The thing is that, besides all that, this is a LOTR based card game. Everyone has said that already, and so I will again. Lunatics or not, this game is focused to people who are interested in Tolkien's world, and they're it's main source of income. I'd say that about 70% of players are indeed theme players, and when you have such a large portion of your crowd in that category, you have to focus your efforts on pleasing that category. If you read Caleb's articles, you can see how they've been doing exactly that, and most of the preview articles have been about theme and story and whatnot, so the focus on isn't going away anytime soon. LOTR is one of the biggest fantasy franchises ever and one with some of the most ardent fanbases, so really, what did you expect when you join a community based around this game? To go in the forums and tell people that they're nuts because they don't have the same taste as you? Really? Anyway, it's obvious that this game was designed for Tolkien fans, and ust because you're an enlightened minority doesn't mean everyone has to accomodate to your opinions in a community forum, let alone the developers of this game.\n\n \n\nTribal decks make sense in a game such as this. Much like they would in a Dark Ages based lcg with the britons, vikings, saxons etc. Do they make sense machanically? Maybe not to you. Do they make sense thematically? Hell yes. And guess what, this game is focused on theme.\n\n \n\nThat said, I still wouldn't like to see them only focus on traits, since that would, as you say, make for an \"artificial\" deckbuilding guideline. I agree on that. However, I still see that this game has a very high level of thematic customization since you can, and in fact it's also endorsed, make a deck with Dunhere, Elrond and Thalin as your heroes. Wasn't the fellowship of the ring exactly that? A collection of unlikely races joining up to go on an adventure? I think there's really no more need for a tribal focus than the one they're already doing.\n\nEdited February 10, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97494-a-cry-for-more-universal-cards/?do=findComment&comment=983925","commentId":983925,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1392306982,"content":">  \n> \n> > not sure exactly how having a deep understanding of the methodologies of teaching academia has anything to do with a card game having multicultural themes but w/e.

Why? Well, I've built a Dwarf deck (a definitively tribal one) and also used Venya and Elrond in it. Venya being, the most restrictive card in the game. So I played a card that required one very specific card to be played with it, and played it in a deck that had a completely different set of demands.\n\n \n\nYet on the other hand, under your analysis for Morgul Vale, a Dwarf (really on the virtue of being an ally, but they all generally have solid stats) would be a universally playable card. Outlands characters would be universally playable, yet they are the most tribal of tribes.\n\n \n\nYour reasoning breaks down because you do not consider the traits that are generated by Heroes to be resources. Instead, you treat your Heroes like they are just cards in your deck, which they are actually not. I mean, literally. In the rule book, your deck does not include your heroes.\n\n \n\nEvery card requires something (unless you want to play a deck of 0 cost neutral cards). Requiring a trait doesn't make your deck tribal when you know that you can start off with a Hero with that trait, because you start off with a hero with that trait and Heroes are not in your deck. So why would it require your deck to be tribal, when the card requirement can be satisfied without involving your deck at all?\n\n \n\nA tribal deck is a deck of cards where the cards in the deck synergy/require each other to work optimally. Not simply because it shares a trait.\n\n \n\nSpear of the Mark is tribal? Why? Because playing something like Theoden (or some Rohan hero and some Tactic hero) is necessary? Does playing Theoden force you into a tribe? Does playing Spear of the Mark and Theoden force you into a tribe? It doesn't. \n\n \n\nI mean, Spear of the Mark is generally terrible, but if you are honestly looking at what deck this leads to, it's not a Rohan deck it's a quick strike type deck, running cards like Quick Strike, Theoden/Dunhere, Eorlingas. Or maybe they combine that with more direct damage cards. But the point is, you don't actually have to run any of those cards. You can run any other set of cards that you want (Spheres not with standing), because neither of the cards force you into a tribe.\n\n \n\nI mean, I could go on and on...\n\nEdited February 14, 2014 by Downer"}]}
