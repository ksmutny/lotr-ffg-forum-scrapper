This is because the monosphere decks are too specialised in strategies and can only handle one type of game. For instance, Spirit will be great if you have a lot of locations, because questing effects and willpower are powerful, and you can control threat levels, etc. On the other hand, if you have a deluge of enemies, it will become difficult to win. Conversely, Tactics will be able to handle powerful enemies, but since questing is very weak, you won't be able to win if locations pile up in the staging area. Lore is more specialised in healing and advance card discovery. Leadership is more balanced, but is still specialised towards resource production.\n\nThe bottom line is that in solo monosphere decks are very dependent on the nature of Encounter cards to be able to win. Therefore in solo you will rapidly want to use multi-sphere decks, so that you can balance the various effect types (resource management, healing, knowledge, Q, A, D). And this will also mean that you will need the cards in the expansions.\n\nOn BGG, there is also a very good document explaining the card synergies, by type: http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/75357/complete-player-card-list-combos [http://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/75357/complete-player-card-list-combos]. This is very helpful, but you may want to consider this document as a spoiler and want to discover this yourself first."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70226-first-game%E2%80%A6location-hosed/?do=findComment&comment=685516","commentId":685516,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1346388178,"content":"zelq said:\n\n Play the game for the first time today.

(though that was down to poor playing haha)"}]}
