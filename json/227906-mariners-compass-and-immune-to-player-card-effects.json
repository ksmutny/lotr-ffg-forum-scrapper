When using the compass to search the top 5 cards for a new location, if one of the cards has immune to player card effects, can you select that one? Is the immunity in effect when it isn't in play?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227906-mariners-compass-and-immune-to-player-card-effects/?do=findComment&comment=2370111","commentId":2370111,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1471430339,"content":"We already know that Beorn can be targeted by Landroval's effect once he gets discarded, because \"Immune to player card effects\" doesn't count on an out-of-play card. So an immune location should work the same way: while it's in the encounter deck, it's in an out-of-play state, so it isn't immune.\n\nÂ \n\nSo I'd say that yes, Mariner's Compass can go fetch a location that's normally immune to player card effects. However, this probably won't be as useful as it sounds, because most quests that have locations with \"Immune to player card effects\" place those locations into the staging area during setup, or else they put those locations \"aside, out of play\" in order to bring them in during later stages of the quest -- and Mariner's Compass won't be able to go fetch them while they're set aside out of play."}]}
