Plus, I made the card unique, so it won't grow out of proportion if there is a lot of ungeround mountains around. It's something like Light of Valinor for dwarves now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232074-im-back-and-ive-got-some-new-tricks/?do=findComment&comment=2450936","commentId":2450936,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1476133471,"content":"Yeah, the card is extremely good,basically, as you say, a Dwarf version of LoV or Wingfoot.

Secrecy needs value here and now, removing potential offender for future does nothing for secrecy's current board state, and the threat clock is ticking, so literally any other cards would be better. That's why I decided to ditch secrecy altogether.\n\n \n\nWhy it now targets only treacheries. The new victory display theme that was introduced not long ago, it has None Return which allows you to add enemies to the victory display, and Leave No Trace which allows you to add locations to the victory display. There is no direct way to add treacheries to the victory display, except for overpriced original Out of the Wild (plus Scout Ahead, which is a 1 per deck sidequest). So I decided to dedicate Out of the Wild fully to the treacheries, increasing the search range and reducing the cost to match other events.\n\n \n\nI might have overstepped by allowing to pull treachery from the active encounter deck instead of adding a treachery that just got resolved, I'll try to build a victory display deck and play around to see how it goes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232074-im-back-and-ive-got-some-new-tricks/?do=findComment&comment=2470163","commentId":2470163,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1477171625,"content":"I think, I've almost reached the end of my project.
