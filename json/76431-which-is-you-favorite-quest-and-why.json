I'm an old board / card / rpg gamer and i found this game to be one of the best co-op / card games EVER ! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n    So i'll make the start , and say that my favorite Quest so far is ''Over the Misty Mountains Grim'' from the first HOBBIT Saga expansion.\n\n    I like the way this Quest is split in 2 parts . At the first one you try to run over the Misty Mountains through some terrifying Stone Giants , spying crows and deadly hazzards only to end up in (second part) a dungeon full of goblins/orcs led by a great goblin ( with the inspired name ''The Great Goblin'' sonreir [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_scripts/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/sonreir.gif] )"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76431-which-is-you-favorite-quest-and-why/?do=findComment&comment=740574","commentId":740574,"userName":"Alex6222","timestamp":1356874437,"content":"Over the Misty Mountains Grim is in my top 5.

All of the original quests suffer a bit from scaling poorly. With that - \n\nEscape from Dol Guldur - too hard solo. I rated it 9 on BGG so I must have liked it  two player (2 handed) & my best LOTR experience was losing to this when I had to reshuffle right at the end of the game & got the Nazgul I had finally killed again.\n\nHunt for Golllum - the Hunters are very spiky & there are too many locations to be dynamic (it's a bit skew with random 8 threat 8 attack baddies)\n\nJourney to Rhosgobel - too skewed to the healing gimmick.\n\n Hills of Emin Mul - pretty  boring with only locations to worry about. Possibly the worst quest but I enjoyed it the last time I tried it.\n\nThe Dead Marshes - losing Gollum in the swamp can give a very long & tedious game. Trying to guard him is a bit of a lottery\n\nReturn to Mirkwood - another good scenario but it's very hard solo, skewed to threat reduction?\n\nInto the Pit  (or something) - I like this one but you can get creature locked on the first location which is frustrating\n\nEscape from Moria - a gimmick scenario where bypassing the objectives is the thing to do\n\nRedhorn Gate - good but can have a tedious end game if you failed to draw the VP locations\n\nRivendell - Grr sleeping Sentry. I hate it but beating it gave me huge pleasure so it's not all bad….\n\nWatcher in the Water - fun but depends on the tentacle lottery. This is almost a favourite\n\nThe Long dark, Foundations of Stone - not played these enough to opine. Foundations is no doubt better 2+ player & I have only soloed it\n\nShadow & Flame - easy if you \"cheat\" it very hard if you do not. \n\nWe Shall Away Ere Break of Day - fun enough but getting the treasure seems too random\n\nI have not played the other hobbit ones enough to know.\n\nPeril in Pelagir - Easiest of the HoN scenarios but the thematic bits work backwards. \n\nInto Ithillien - Very skewed to Battle & has a few very nasty cards. Thematic stuff backwards here too\n\nSiege of Cair Andros - good big fight.. I find it easier than Into Ithilien & saving the starting locations makes sense though I think they could be better tuned. Also needs a  special deck.\n\nThere as threatened what I do not like about the other scenarios that stop them being favourites.  I obviously like fighting more than questing. I use skew to mean hard to beat with a deck that is not made for it , though that's probably coloured a bit by my like of fighting.  Ie if you love questing you may find Conlfict at the Carrock skewed against you.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76431-which-is-you-favorite-quest-and-why/?do=findComment&comment=741021","commentId":741021,"userName":"Alex6222","timestamp":1356953779,"content":"Pickles said:\n\nWe Shall Away Ere Break of Day - fun enough but getting the treasure seems too random\n\n\n\nI have to disagree.
