Tharbad being an ancient city in ruins full of secrets I would have made the heroes investigate the ruins in search of information by themselves with possibly a big reveal at the end of the quest, not just another escort mission with a little twist. But I guess the former idea is a bit hard to do in a card game so I understand. At least the art on Nalir looks great. Also, more Gondor support? Awesome! Hopefully it will be something which will help the gondor deck be more viable (not like the dwarf support in ATS, though dwarves didn't need it).

He has a one off effect and that's it, and it is also an effect that is going to take a little set up. Is it worth a sneak attack, which calls for an out of sphere card anyway? I don't think so, I would just stick with Gandalf. Once he is in play his primary role for a solo player in mono tactics situation is probably going to be questing. 5 cost for a mere 2 wp, this is what tactics has to pay! 3 wp would be awesome, tactics really needs some help and for 5 cost they deserve it.

Those eagles better bring some shiny silver tokens for me, grasped in their talons!\n\n\n\nOops, missed this before my last reply. I still think that Radagast is a boon. He eventually pays for himself if you can keep him out long enough, and with Horn of Gondor in an Eagle deck, you can generally pay for these cards relatively well (especially in multiplayer with lots of other characters bouncing out of play). Gwaihir's ability to not only bring back the inevitably discarded weaker eagles, but also guarantee that they'll leave play again, only helps bolster this strategy (which also helps boost the power of Eagles of the Misty Mountains... potentially beyond that of any hero (or even Gandalf with just 3 Eagles attached).\n\nGwaihir helps fix one of the biggest problems with the Eagles, losing too many Eagles before getting Eagles of the Misty Mountains out. To The Eyrie was supposed to help (even though thematically it was supposed to save other allies, not other Eagle allies), but its cost was too prohibitive (Gwaihir obviously has a high cost too, but he also sticks around to help out as an ally) and requires another eagle to be in play (to exhaust for the cost) AND must be in your hand the moment the ally is discarded (along with saving 2 resources after planning phase). Gwaihir is just plain better.\n\n \n\n \n\n> I don't see Gwaihir being much of a game changer for an eagle deck or a mono tactic deck. It's a five cost card, how many are you willing to put in your deck to build a strategy around? I doubt more than 2 or else he is going to just clog the deck. Put him with a bunch of other 4 and 5 cost eagles in a sphere that has difficulty generating resources, and your stuck with the same situation were in. He has a one off effect and that's it, and it is also an effect that is going to take a little set up. Is it worth a sneak attack, which calls for an out of sphere card anyway? I don't think so, I would just stick with Gandalf. Once he is in play his primary role for a solo player in mono tactics situation is probably going to be questing. 5 cost for a mere 2 wp, this is what tactics has to pay! 3 wp would be awesome, tactics really needs some help and for 5 cost they deserve it. Give the sphere a little love already. Basically, i see Gwahir as another card for a vilya deck. I can only hope that there is something for eagles that is going to get them in to play a little easier, and sorry Radigast is not the answer.\n> \n> Anyway, i look forward to giving him a try, but I am not expecting it to change the current situation. Looks the same to me.\n\n \n\nYou may be a bit more of a realist than me... or just more pessimistic. I don't expect Gwaihir to totally change the Eagles deck, but I certainly expect him to make them more consistent. I agree that the high cost is prohibitive, but not insurmountable. I definitely hope to see more 1, 2, and 3 cost eagles to fill in the gaps.\n\n \n\nI also don't think Gwaihir was meant to bolster mono-Tactics solo play. You're right that 5 resources is way too much for 2 willpower, even for Tactics. Gwaihir seems to be designed for multiplayer where he can be very flexible and do what needs to be done (quest, defend, or attack) while also making the Eagles strategy more consistent.\n\nEdited March 13, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101115-gwaihir/?do=findComment&comment=1011938","commentId":1011938,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1394732760,"content":">  \n> \n> Spare Hood and Cloak is always a hit or miss type of attachment, but if you're going to use it, why not put it on the Lord of the Eagles?\n\n \n\nCannot get the mental image of Gwaihir trying to fit into a tiny cloak out of my head. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101115-gwaihir/?do=findComment&comment=1012235","commentId":1012235,"userName":"Catastrophic09","timestamp":1394746812,"content":"Too bad he doesn't have Ranged but I still think he is good for the cost and helps the eagles deck a bit and revives it so people will try it out again.  For me I usually lost a Winged Guardian or Vassal of the Windlord early in the game so that makes Gwaihir a good help there.  Yeah he cost a lot but I think it's worth it and eagles are an expensive deck and that is its weakness which all decks should have.\n\n \n\nAnd he should NOT have 3 willpower and I think FFG needs to be careful with giving tactics allies even 2 willpower otherwise Tactics will become superior to other spheres if they can just as easily quest as Spirit.
