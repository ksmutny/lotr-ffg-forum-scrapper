Since Eowyn is not in play when it is time to compare will to threat, you do not get to count it. That's just my opinion though. I'm sure there's an official ruling somewhere, but I have not seen it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61779-what-if-i-discard-a-ally-after-comiit-him-to-a-quest/?do=findComment&comment=605265","commentId":605265,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1331649702,"content":"there is an action window between the staging step (after everyone is commited) and tallying up threat/willpower, so if you commit, then they get removed i dont believe it will count- for instance i was playing with about 3 1 hit point dwarves commited- then the staging step brought death to them all- so i had to not count there willpwoer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61779-what-if-i-discard-a-ally-after-comiit-him-to-a-quest/?do=findComment&comment=605304","commentId":605304,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1331655241,"content":"Marael said:\n\nunless removed by a card effect\n\n\n\nRide to Ruin is a card.......and it´s effect is a card effect.\n\nIf a Hero gets killed while questing, its willpower won´t count. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61779-what-if-i-discard-a-ally-after-comiit-him-to-a-quest/?do=findComment&comment=605315","commentId":605315,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1331656368,"content":"i can always appreciate your answers muemakan- you always manage to say your point in a sentence when it takes me a paragraph"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61779-what-if-i-discard-a-ally-after-comiit-him-to-a-quest/?do=findComment&comment=605347","commentId":605347,"userName":"Sprenger","timestamp":1331662264,"content":"Marael said:\n\n \n\nI commit an ally to a quest during step 1 of Quest Phase.
