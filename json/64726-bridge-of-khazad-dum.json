You CAN, however, spend a Spirit resource to \"put Bofur into play\" during the quest phase. Doing so does not count as \"playing\" a card, and thus is not prevented by the Bridge's effect. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/64726-bridge-of-khazad-dum/?do=findComment&comment=632591","commentId":632591,"userName":"Phodrum","timestamp":1337306177,"content":" Thank you for your help folks."}]}
