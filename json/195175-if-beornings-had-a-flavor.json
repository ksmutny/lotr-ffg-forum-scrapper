'At the end of the round, turn card'. The only problem I have with such a mechanic, albeit interesting, is that Gandalf mentions 'He is under no spell but his own.' Beorn was capable of controlling himself. So, some forced effect that turns a Beorning into a Bear is not in line with the lore, you would think.\n\nWe also don't really know if the other Beornings (the people that live in Rhovanion with their leader Grimbeorn the Old), others being not Beorn, were even capable of skinchanging.\n\nI would also think shuffling back would be the best, to let them rest from their outburst, but not practical indeed. Direct damage is what I gave them, if I remember correctly.\n\nI would not only want to see beefy, strong and expensive Tactics allies, but some Scouts and Trackers should be there too.
