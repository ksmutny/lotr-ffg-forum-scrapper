This effect may be triggered by each player once each round. \"\n\nNote the underlined bit. That means you can only use it once per round, but in a multi-player game, other players can also use it, though also only once per round each. (This makes her noticeably stronger in larger games than in solo.)\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252573-eowyn-action-question/?do=findComment&comment=2845579","commentId":2845579,"userName":"caribecards","timestamp":1498011896,"content":"Thanks for the clarification."}]}
