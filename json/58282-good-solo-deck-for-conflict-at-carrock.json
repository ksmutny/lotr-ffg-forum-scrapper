cards which can destroy your chances of winning\n\n \n\ni think you want alot of buff cards- i.e. dwarven axe/ gondolin blade/ dunadain attatchments that give +1 attack and defense (dunedain mark and signal) give them to gimli and get unexpected courage on him and youve got yourself a tank, the downside to this is that would mean you having a leadership/tactics deck which will put your threat sky high to begin with.......\n\n \n\ncarrock can be either incredibly easy or incredibly hard, depending on your card draw, so its a bit of a 50/50 with me\n\nso to sum up i would say - low cost heros, cards to increase stats, plenty of allies, threat reduction, and treachery cancelling, so......maybe Tactic/Spirit with elanor to cancel when revealed, gimli as tank, and im not sure about the other, you dont particularly need alot of questing here, so im thinking another tactics hero"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58282-good-solo-deck-for-conflict-at-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=573715","commentId":573715,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1325504489,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nalso with spirit you can cancel SACKED!

Or Theodred - Eowyn - Gimli.\n\nGenerally speaking, this is very easy scenario for solo player if you use turtle strategy. Some cards can be very nasty like early sacked or early snake when you have noone to defend.  But even if they come into play, you can still win. I won game when sacked was encountered in first turn and another game when it came in second turn. Still, sacked is the most feared card and can make you lose a game easily (especially if there is a single sacked in early game or double sacked in middle game).\n\nAnyway, a few tips:\n\n- slowly build an army, enemy encounter deck is sending just 1 card against you each turn and you should be able to control the game during stage 1B. There are only few sacked cards in deck so you should not be drawing them frequently.\n\n- do NOT flip to stage 2B before you are ready. In other words, do not overcommit characters to quest. Usually Eowyn + Theodred is enough. And remember that Legolas ability is optional.\n\n- wait for Grimbeorn and buy him. Statistically you have much higher chances of finding Grimbeorn before you get sacked.\n\n- remember that there are virtually no nasty shadow effects that can hurt you, this makes blocking / leaving attacks undefended much easier\n\n- remember that some enemy cards are helping you . Despair is a real winner here. Same for misty mountains goblins. You can even leave them in play so they can attack you each turn while you block them efficiently. As an effect, they help you control progress during stage 1B,.\n\n- the worst thing about sacked card is that it limits your resources. Use cards that help you with that like Theodred/Steward/Radagast. If tactic hero gets sacked while Radagast is in play, you can still play a lot of eagles and many tactic cards are not blocked. Remember that if hero gets sacked, you can use resources which ALREADY are available on him. So if you have 15 resources accumulated on theodred thanks to steward of gondor, you can choose to sack him when sacked is encountered. Theodred will not get any new resources, but existing amount of resources should be more than enough for the entire game. If you play Lore, you may consider using Iron Hill Miner (dwarf, cost 2, can remove attachment from hero when it comes into play). Another way to \"unsack\" a hero is to play Landroval and get the hero killed, so hero will return to play and be free! (and you can even sneak attack landroval). I used this once or twice when I was playtesting Landroval usefulness.\n\n- when you have your army ready (a lot of allies and grimbeorn in play), you have several possibilities:\n\na) lower your threat to 33 or less and flip to stage 2B. All trolls go into play but they do not engage you automatically. Instead, you choose to encounter Louise and kill him in first turn. Your threat goes to 36 and 37 in next turn when all remaining 3 trolls engage you. Then you kill the trolls in 2 maybe 3 turns , but they are easy to defeat , you can block with grimbeorn or lose some cannon fodder.\n\nb) lower your threat to less than 30 . 20-25 sounds really ok, but even 30 may be enough. Engage trolls 1 each turn and make sure that you commit enough characters to quest so threat does not go up. This way you can be killing trolls while they are isolated. Save Louise to be the last troll. This is a little bit risky strategy if you have no ability to counter frightened beast (eagles are your friend in this quest) and you need quite a lot of allies in play (so you can both quest and attack efficiently).\n\nc) optionally, if you use elfhelm and have a lot of firepower, you may risk fighting with 4 trolls in the same turn. For example you have 36 threat and all trolls attack you. You get + 8 threat (elfhelm gives you -4), you kill Louise at first possible moment. At the end of turn you have 2 or 3 trolls still standing and 45 threat, so you still have a couple of turns to finish the job before threat goes up to 50. You can use feints instead of elfhelm."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58282-good-solo-deck-for-conflict-at-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=573812","commentId":573812,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1325518376,"content":"excellent points above, and to help that strategy use longbeard map maker, then you can control how much willpower you commit to a quest not going over 1b before you're ready"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58282-good-solo-deck-for-conflict-at-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=573815","commentId":573815,"userName":"guciomir","timestamp":1325519126,"content":"Yeah, long beard map maker is really nice to control the progress if you have steward of gondor engine running.

Then use a leadership splash for steward and marks. Mark came into the game at this time so you can get your marks on dunhere and attack for 6 into the staging area.. you have card draw off Bilbo instead of beravor, so use UC on dunhere.. keep your threat low with sneak attack gandalfs and greetings and tomb+greeting... then you can use UC to get dunhere to attack multiple times into the staging area.. killing off the trolls and other mobs with out feeling any pressure.

I got a 24 score, and felt like i could have dragged the game out longer to drop my score lower, with fairly little risk to victory. I see a lot of suggestings on tactics deck... but i think it would be too hard to keep your threat down... and even the best tactics deck is going to buckle if all 4 trolls engage.\n\nWith this deck, the trick is to keep your threat as low as possible. The sneak attack gandalfs and Greetings help to do this. I am sure there is some sort of alteration of this deck that could get card draw... that would probably be ideal.\n\nSo you keep your threat super low. This deck is also a good quester due to to eowyn and various allies. In 2B, questing is vital... the threat is already 8, + what ever you are unlucky enough to draw. One of the lands can easy add an extra 6... so, you will be needing 12+ will power in this part of the quest...\n\nThen theres the trolls. I did this by damage boosting dunhere. Since my threat stays as far bellow 34 as I can get it, i use him to slowly widdle down the trolls. In my second victory, i used the gandalfs for direct damage with dunhere to kill one of the trolls... my threat was lower than starting, and i felt confident enough to go with the damage. If you have grimbeorn and enough allies out  When a troll is low enough of if you can get a combind 12 attack, engange, and then gang up on him. Sacraficing eomund comes in handy here if you want to risk it without grimbeorn. Basically, it takes a little longer, but if you can fly under the radar with that low threat, and widdle down the trolls, you can eventually win.

He is expensive. But then i start to use him more and more and i find him quite good. With UC he is for quest and for the kill. Actually this deck strategy based a lot on Glorifindel. He have SOG +all songs and 2 UC. Bilbo and Frodo equip with Boots, Protector, FH and BB on Bilbo. Then your heroes can quest, defend and attack. +Gildor and Haldir helps a lot. I didn put Zigil miner or Tracker cose is to powerful and broken all idea of the game(as i say before never use Beravur, Trackers or Will of the west..... now i think i add Zigil Miner too).\n\nIn My logic i always build up decks for play whole game. Not against a certain quests! Is boring for me cose if you build up deck special against certain quest you will have so big advantage so you will win for sure. Glorifindel in this case really important hero for his a good status  he can quest good , attack strong and also his healing ability very useful( special with Bilbo cose he is really fragile).In different quest you use him different. But he is really solid hero and can be use for many purpose. I didn like dwarfs to much anyway! Actually i didn like them at all.......\n\nAnd my solo scores with this deck is the best for now!!!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58282-good-solo-deck-for-conflict-at-carrock/?do=findComment&comment=583134","commentId":583134,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327237885,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIn My logic i always build up decks for play whole game.

When i start to play this game(since May 2011) i read some article where designers explain about tournament system for this game. There will be tournament system for 2 player game. Players come to play and declare them self as a team. Maybe there will be some special tournaments pack or some..... They was not sure about this....... But there is rules: deck should be 50 cards minimum and no more then 3 copies of the same cards and 2 players as a team.
