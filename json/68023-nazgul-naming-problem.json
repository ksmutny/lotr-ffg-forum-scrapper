MECCG had the well-worked-out MERP background to draw on for its named Nazgul. The other TLOTR game game them numbers, not names (eg Ulairi Nertea = Ninth Nazgul), but in Quenya so they looked like names.\n\nWe already have \"Nazgul of Dol Guldur\" so maybe that is the way they will go - epithets/descriptions, not invented names.\n\nPS it is at least possible that there is a third named Nazgul in the book, namely \"Gothmog Lieutenant of Morgul\".
