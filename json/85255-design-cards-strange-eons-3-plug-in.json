Keep using Strange Eons 2 untill you finish your card set. I checked that the old plugin's compatibility with Strange Eons 3 has been lost..\n 2. Update your cards manually to the new plugin. Strange Eons 2 has the Picture Thief plugin that let's you get the portraits from your cards' files.

I advise you: Before using your cards created with beta 1, make a backup of your cards to avoid painfull loses!\n\nThis version has known problems. Use it only for testing purposes.\n\n \n\nImportant changes for users\n\n * Beta1 cards should load properly, but I haven't tested it as much as I wanted. If you open a beta 1 card that uses something not found in the instalation, like an official Encounter Set icon, a message will appear telling what's missing. If you save the card at this moment, you'll lose your original work. Also, I remind you that this version is incompatible with the old Strange Eons 2 version of the plugin.\n * Now, tag buttons can be found in the context bar. You can add the buttons through the Preferences>Context Bar menu.\n * LotR category in New menu has dissapeared, and cards are distributed though the regular categories. You can filter LotR cards with the selector in the upper-right corner.\n * Card stats' rendering and some templates have been changed to make it more consistent between versions and pretier (and it will change just a bit more in beta3). If you are working on a card set, you should keep using beta1 untill you finish your card set to make sure you've got them all looking similar. Then, you can make a backup of your cards and try loading them with this beta2.\n\nInstalation\n\nThis version won't be available in the Strange Eons catalogue untill is tested. It must be installed manually. Here you can find it: http://www.4shared.com/folder/j5xWZRBW/WIP.html [http://www.4shared.com/folder/j5xWZRBW/WIP.html]\n\n \n\nI've changed how the plugin is distributed, to make it easier to maintain. Now there are 7 packages instead of 2:\n\n * The plugin, containing Core Set components and spheres: TheLordOfTheRingsLCG.seext\n * Additional components appeared later (Objective Ally, Treasure and 3 accesory): TheLordOfTheRingsLCG-P.seext\n\n * Addtional sphere and difficulty variants (Baggins, Easy and customs): TheLordOfTheRingsLCG-V.seext. Note that the Easy circle is just something similar and may not look the same as the official cards.\n\n * Addtional official Encounter Set and Collection icons: TheLordOfTheRingsLCG-I.seext\n\n * 3 high definition add-ons.\n\n \n\nOnly the main plug-in is required to create cards, but you may need to install the P, V and I packages to keep compability with cards created with beta 1. The HD packages are recomended only for printing. The easiest way to install these packages is to unpack the ZIP file and open the seext files through StrangeEons' File menu.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n> I suppose I have a compability problem when I use your tool and install some other plugins.\n> \n> My cards show no name, no values for Attack, defense, quest, cost, hit Points etc.\n> \n>  \n> \n> If I use any of the tags like <will> or <lea> the text dissapears at a certain point, starting with the position where the icon should have appeared.

I hope it's fixed in this version for everyone, because the problem seems a bit random (seems a mixture of a bad font file and SE version changes and who knows what more). If you have the plugin opened as a project (that is, like you were be developing it) and also have it installed normally, you may see this problem.\n\n \n\nFor the compatibility problem, if it persists, tell me wich plugins you have installed, SE version and operative sistem you are using.\n\n \n\nI'll be on vacation for 2 weeks. And I couldn't test this version as much as needed to release it. Please, when you test it a few days (mostly saving and loading cards), tell me the result so I can tell Chris (Strange Eons' creator) to upload it to the catalogue.\n\nEdited August 7, 2013 by karagh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85255-design-cards-strange-eons-3-plug-in/?do=findComment&comment=826901","commentId":826901,"userName":"Ranwyr","timestamp":1375213065,"content":"Thanks for the realy fast reply.

Most problems are related to the font file. The problem is that I included the Shadow effect icon in the font file.

No need to include tags in the name field.\n * Keyword field added.\n * Collection info field added.\n * Icons updated up to The Black Riders.\n * Change default copyright and collection info text in preferences.\n * Option to show or not advanced controls (tints and some texts)\n * Custom bleed margin was removed.

Great job! It is amazing how easy and beautiful to create cards this way. I really love it.\n\nI have a little suggestion: when we create a new card we select the type of the card. (let say an ally). The one who is presented have only a few text. But I think it would be more interesting to add various effects to it (like a force effect, an action and a response, a reference to his name, to a trait and a keyword) so we have example of typography for the most common effects existing. The ones who want to erase his text to write from scratch a new one can do it very easily but it could help to use existing effects. I actually look at similar cards to the one I create on the web to write it the good way and this would help me a lot.\n\nBut may be I'm the only one concerned about making the good work in italic and write the sentence the same way the developer did ^^.\n\nI don't know if I'm clear enough.

It's not an obvious way and it's not easy. So anyone willing to do this kind of stuff just ask how to.\n\nThere is the workaround that will please you:\n\n * Open Window>Setting explorer\n * Most of the card is defined by \"settings\". Some settings select which picture to use for the template or the which font to use. Others keep the user values, like the name, collection icon or stats.\n * changing these values will change how the card looks\n\n \n\n * This will remove the decoration.\n * In that window, in the Key column, look for VictoryDeco\n * Double click on its Value and change it to: TheLordOfTheRingsLCG/image/empty1x1.png\n * It paints a picture, but is a transparent one\n * Press return to accept the change (the key and value will be shown in white now)\n\n \n\n * This will recover the usual font and change the size\n * Look for OptionRight-style in Key column\n * Change value to: FAMILY: {Eons.namedObjects.LRL.BodyFont}; WEIGHT: BOLD; SIZE: 7.0; FOREGROUND: #000000\n * This won't change anything now, but it will show the desired changes when you reload the card. So save your card, close it in the editor and then open it again. \n\n \n\n * Extra: changing placement of the text\n * Look for Location-OptionRight-region in Key column\n * Change value to: 291,464,57,10\n * You can increase or decrease the second value to get the desired vertical placement\n * These numbers describe a box and it's placement: horizontal,vertical, width,height\n * This setting will work right away when changing it\n\nIt's not pretty, but it works.\n\n \n\nOh, and some alignment tags are boound to the text box: justify, top and bottom can't be activated for different parts of the same text box. Only center, left and right are switchable.\n\nEdited October 16, 2018 by HeavyKaragh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85255-design-cards-strange-eons-3-plug-in/?do=findComment&comment=3505923","commentId":3505923,"userName":"Mr_Kew","timestamp":1539730242,"content":"@HeavyKaragh [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/176909-heavykaragh/] Wow, thats amazing!\n\nYou just forgot to mention that I need Developer Tools plugin for this (just in case someone else will find this).\n\nAnyways, thanks for your help."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85255-design-cards-strange-eons-3-plug-in/?do=findComment&comment=3506463","commentId":3506463,"userName":"Mr_Kew","timestamp":1539784924,"content":"@HeavyKaragh [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/176909-heavykaragh/] Oh and can I change it for all the cards at once, on I have to apply this every time?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85255-design-cards-strange-eons-3-plug-in/?do=findComment&comment=3512132","commentId":3512132,"userName":"Amicus Draconis","timestamp":1540303258,"content":"Thankyou, HeavyKaragh, for this awesome plugin.

You can read an explanation about it in the Lord of the Rings plugin section of the preferences. It's on the translation section, on the blue exclamation mark. Whenever you save the component, you save all texts in strings marked with the selected \"game language\" in the plugin preferences. If you change the \"game language\" you will save all strings in other strings, marked with the new \"game language\", keeping the previous language strings. You can check this through settings explorer where you will find, for example, \"name_en_us\" and \"name_es_es\", if you change \"game language\". That way you can load into the card the strings for the language that you want to translate from. It's a bit obscure, but if you don't understand how to use it, I'll try to write a tutorial.\n\nAbout the missing font characters, do you refer to the rules box font too? The character you use as example should work on the rules box. I have updated the card title font with a lot of non-english characters, like the one you show, but I have to upload it to the online repository. I'll try to upload it this week.

I was thinking about adding new font to my Strange Eons and using it by <family font> instead of <se>. But as I have no idea how to do it, so I'm happy to see that you are gonna fix it within a few weeks.\n\nAnyway, thanks for this amazing plugin, it seems you have implemented every feature I can think of, and thanks for your precise and helpful answers to my questions.\n\nOh and my friend agreed to translate the plugin into Czech (cs_CZ) language (we are Czech), but as not everything is currently officially translated, we're thinking about leaving the rest of Encounter Sets in English for now and translate only those, that are already available in Czech, to prevent confusion.
