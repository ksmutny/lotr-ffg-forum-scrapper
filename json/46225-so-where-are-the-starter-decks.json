There are four copies total in the box, and it seems like such a waste to leave so many sitting in there, and not to play with as many as possible. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46225-so-where-are-the-starter-decks/?do=findComment&comment=464838","commentId":464838,"userName":"Mackey79","timestamp":1304740124,"content":"iGaveHimLife said:\n\nahh ok.. yea..

But it's better to begin with mono so that you know what each color stands for.\n\nGrtz"}]}
