One can actually win Dol Guldur. And the stories that develop 2-handed always seemed more Fellowship than solo. Aragorn Core suddenly becomes a savior just like in the books. Having six heroes opens up more combos. And a slow deck may actually have a chance.\n\nI actually went the other way; because of portability issues. The spread gets huge two-player.

They need to cover more ground by splitting up, because any one location is a frickin' huge area in Middle Earth.
