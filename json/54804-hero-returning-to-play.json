Or can I play him again?\n\nIf yes, how does it work? Do I have to pay his Threat cost again, can I play him for free, do I have to pay his Threat cost in resources?\n\nI wasn't able to find anything about this, but maybe I simply looked in the wrong places...\n\nThanks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54804-hero-returning-to-play/?do=findComment&comment=542597","commentId":542597,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1318737007,"content":"Dead heroes are never shuffled into the player deck.
