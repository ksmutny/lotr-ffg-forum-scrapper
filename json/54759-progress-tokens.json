Example, Quest=Down the Anduin 1B, progress tokens needed=8, condition=No Hill Trolls may be in play in order to fulfill the quest. SO, when you have 8 tokens on it and still need to defeat the Troll what do you do with excess tokens? You still need to quest each quest phase but do you just stop putting tokens on or will you end up with say 21 tokens before you defeat the Troll?\n\n \n\nThe reason I think this is important is if you get some encounter/shadow effects that tells you to remove x tokens from the current quest. I always play with when the max tokens are reached, in this case 8, I stop putting tokens on, and if I loose some tokens then I just have to get some more progress when the Troll is defeated. But since this can make or brake your game I just wanted to know what you do. Don't wanna make the game unnecessary difficult :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nI've been thinking about this for a while but didn't think it important until yesterday where I discovered it might have made things easier."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54759-progress-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=542308","commentId":542308,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1318655687,"content":"I certainly don't see anything which says you can't put extra tokens on the quest card, so yes, in the examples given, go over the total, and if tokens are removed you'll still be ok.\n\nThat said, I usually give up putting tokens on Emyn Muil after a round or two."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54759-progress-tokens/?do=findComment&comment=542364","commentId":542364,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1318672490,"content":"This came up on the forums previously so I asked Nate.
