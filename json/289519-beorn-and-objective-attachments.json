Once I cleared the encounter I attached him to Beorn for both quests....is this allowed? The objective card is not labeled as an attachment even though you are attaching so I figured it was ok."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289519-beorn-and-objective-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=3598174","commentId":3598174,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1548011676,"content":"I'm pretty sure any card that becomes attached to another is then treated as an attachment, just like poison/venom from Flies and Spiders.\n\nThere may be something on this in the FAQ or ORR, but not that I can find quickly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/289519-beorn-and-objective-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=3598177","commentId":3598177,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1548011985,"content":"This is what I found in the FAQ, section 1.23 (attachments):\n\nAny objective card that attaches to another card is\ntreated as an attachment in addition to its other card\ntypes.\nAny non-objective card that attaches to another card\nloses its original card type and gains the attachment\ncard type.\nThe “Attach to...” rules text on an attachment is only a\nplay restriction, and is not taken into account after the\ncard is already attached.\n \nSo no, you cannot attach Mugash to Beorn.

Thanks for the response. I didn't attach any of the keys to him in the three trials....maybe i'll go back through the other quests.\n\nSeriously though, what better way to keep an orc in line that put him with a bear!\n\nEdited January 21, 2019 by mewmartigan"}]}
