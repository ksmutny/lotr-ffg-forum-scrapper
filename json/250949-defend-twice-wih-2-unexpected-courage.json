This is is true regardless of how you came to be ready.\n\nUnexpected Courage is a very popular way to achieve being ready for this purpose and thus get multiple uses out of one of your better defenders (eg Beregond or Erkenbrand). Armored Destrier is also a fine choice for achieving this.\n\nOf course, you only need one unexpected courage to be ready for a second attack, but with two of them, you could defend three times.\n\n \n\n "}]}
