It's about time.  And I like the rulings that were made - I think the scoring system change is simple (although it is one more thing to keep track of), and should solve the problem adequately.\n\nIn the article announcing the FAQ, Nate does state that the Quick Strike ruling is a reversal of the old ruling, but it is certainly something I can live with.\n\nFinally this should put to rest the Eleanor issues, the Gandalf/Stand and Fight confusion, and the persistent Carrock question.\n\n \n\nStill waiting for a detailed timing chart, but this'll make things flow a lot more smoothly, imo."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55574-behold-a-faq-is-upon-us/?do=findComment&comment=549695","commentId":549695,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1320063139,"content":"Some interesting stuff in here.

Adding 10pts per turn is just silly. \n\n \n\n\n\nWell, do you want a crowded GenCon LOTR Tourney where everyone is stalling and trying to get the lowest score that way? Would take forever. This scoring change is as much for the game itself as it is for the FFG peeps that would have to stand there waiting for the games to be over. It's easier to just add the 10 points per round than to have people standing around with stop watches and a time limit at tournaments.\n\nMy only issue with it is that now the scores I have in the Quest Log are probably delete worthy now. LEGACY SCORES!!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55574-behold-a-faq-is-upon-us/?do=findComment&comment=549781","commentId":549781,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1320072273,"content":"Marlow said:\n\nMy only issue with it is that now the scores I have in the Quest Log are probably delete worthy now.
