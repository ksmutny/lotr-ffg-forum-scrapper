I'd love to see it have 5 -6 quest cards and maybe 2 separate encounter decks to give the flavor of a long, arduous return encountering danger through locations, creatures and treachery cards. The ceiling for threat would likely have to be raised - that would be interesting!\n\n \n\nFor the hero my initial guess is Leadership.  I think there will be a balance of the spheres as of KD release and I think the unknown Dwarf is likely Lore.  I'm guessing Elf as we've not seen Dwarves or Elves in the expansion and there are two Dwarves on the way in KD.  I'll go with Thranduril as the Elf as he fits the theme and would be a good Ldr hero.   However, I'm second guessing myself some.  I think Thranduril would be a cool objective ally in the RtM encounter deck like the Rangers in MaO.  Also, I want to see Dain as a leadership hero in KD, leaving this next one to be lore if the balance theory is correct.\n\nI'd love to see some of the themes show up in new spheres - not as strong but giving some secondary ties.  Examples would be some minor healing in Leadership, Threat reduction in lore, Buffs in spirit, etc.  Again, not as strong as the primary cards..  And I would love a stud, unique ally for leadership!\n\nAnyway, looking forward to it and KD!    4 new quests in a month or so!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56164-return-to-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=555042","commentId":555042,"userName":"Shiv@n","timestamp":1321036397,"content":"The french editor board revealed the hero will be Dain II and that he will \"help other dwarf\".\n\nNo pictures or else for the moment !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56164-return-to-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=555064","commentId":555064,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1321042556,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\n \n\nI rather like the fact that elven allies are strong but quiet expensive.  It seemed to fit well with the lore.  I think that, top to bottom, Lore has the best allies in the game.  Between Henamarth, the Rivendell Minstrel, and the Smith you have three very strong lore allies in the 1-2 cost range. \n\n \n\n \n\nRivendell Minstrel is 3.
