The only relevant card for that would be Blue Mountain Trader.\n\nAnd what about events? Is there a different ruling for limit once per phase/round?

So I believe any events with a once per phase restriction (I don't think there are any once per round events are there?) should be treated as if they have the more accurate later phrasing \" [You/The players, as a group,] can only play 1 copy of [event] each phase.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279905-events-and-limit-once-per-round/?do=findComment&comment=3419134","commentId":3419134,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1532866830,"content":"Thanks."}]}
