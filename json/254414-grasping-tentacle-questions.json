If Grasping Tentacle attaches as the result of the forced effect then the attack is cancelled (no damage assigned), since the Tentacle is no longer an enemy\n\n> 52 minutes ago, Rouxxor said:\n> \n> 2/ You are right!\n\nThanks for the confirmation!\n\nI am playing this scenario for the first time and want to make sure that I get all of the Tentacle timings correct.\n\nEdited July 18, 2017 by jnicol"}]}
