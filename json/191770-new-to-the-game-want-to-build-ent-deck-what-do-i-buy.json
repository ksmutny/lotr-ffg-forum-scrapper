Brand new to the game. Been playing X-wing and a little Star Wars LCG, but I was very intrigued by the solo play option of LOTR. I will likely only be playing it solo. So my questions are 1) Is an Ent deck viable for solo play? Or does it need to be questing with a second player/hand? and 2) What do I buy next to have a solid Ent deck? I have the Core Set and Treason of Saruman saga expansion. Loved getting Treebeard hero! I loved the Ents in the books and movies, so thematically it sounds like fun. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191770-new-to-the-game-want-to-build-ent-deck-what-do-i-buy/?do=findComment&comment=1857760","commentId":1857760,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1445386798,"content":"I haven't played a full Ent deck yet, but the products that include Ent cards are: Celebrimbor's Secret, The Antlered Crown, The Treason of Saruman, Escape from Mount Gram, Across the Ettenmoors and The Land of Shadow. Currently the Ents are featured in only 2 spheres, Lore and Tactics, so you'll want to play those. As I said, I have never played the deck but I imagine it's really good for solo, as Ents became a really powerful trait very fast.\n\n \n\nNow, regarding Treebeard hero, I personally wouldn't recommend him as the optimal choice for an Ent deck, as he doesn't have any synergy with the other Ents. I much prefer ally Treebeard, since he collects resources to play Ents and can ready Ent allies, which is a very poweful effect. Still, I have used Treebeard hero to great effect in a deck I posted a while back in the deck section. It's not an Ent deck with all the bells and whistles (although it features a few Ent allies), but it's a Treebeard focused deck nonetheless."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191770-new-to-the-game-want-to-build-ent-deck-what-do-i-buy/?do=findComment&comment=1857766","commentId":1857766,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1445387335,"content":"This is my ally Ent deck, which I have found to be pretty solid in solo. \n\n \n\nYou could also go for a hero Treebeard deck, although they typically have a lot more healing cards rather than Ent allies.\n\n \n\nFaramir Mablung Bifur Ents [http://ddddirk.github.io/lotrdb/#/%23NoIgYghgThC2CWUAEBZCAjANgVwHYHMkAheAM22QFFcAXAZxABpRSmAmRgRgF1mB2RgA4ALF17AOHHvy7DOjAMziAnIvlLmIVowBsjNuJABTJnoMzOnVRuADOwvTYAMjPgsWGTjAKz6Vu9XEXNkd-BQ4bYyZLD2Z3TidBWOA9TilxeIVfGwFBUOZg92dFURtfBLFuIA]\nTotal Cards: 50  \n \nHeroes (starting threat: 28)  \n    Bifur [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Bifur-kd] (Khazad-Dûm)  \n    Faramir [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Faramir-tlos] (The Land of Shadow)  \n    Mablung [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Mablung-nie] (The Nin-in-Eilph)  \nAllies (24)  \n 3x Booming Ent [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Booming-Ent-tac] (The Antlered Crown)  \n 3x Derndingle Warrior [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Derndingle-Warrior-efmg] (Escape from Mount Gram)  \n 2x Legolas [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Legolas-tos] (The Treason of Saruman)  \n 2x Skinbark [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Skinbark-tlos] (The Land of Shadow)  \n 2x Quickbeam [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Quickbeam-tos] (The Treason of Saruman)  \n 3x Wandering Ent [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Wandering-Ent-cs] (Celebrimbor's Secret)  \n 3x Wellinghall Preserver [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Wellinghall-Preserver-ate] (Across the Ettenmoors)  \n 3x Gandalf [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Gandalf-core] (Core Set)  \n 3x Treebeard [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Treebeard-tac] (The Antlered Crown)  \nAttachments (3)  \n 3x Steward of Gondor [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Steward-of-Gondor-core] (Core Set)  \nEvents (23)  \n 3x Sneak Attack [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Sneak-Attack-core] (Core Set)  \n 3x Tighten Our Belts [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Tighten-Our-Belts-nie] (The Nin-in-Eilph)  \n 3x Boomed and Trumpeted [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Boomed-and-Trumpeted-efmg] (Escape from Mount Gram)  \n 3x Feint [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Feint-core] (Core Set)  \n 3x Daeron's Runes [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Daeron%27s-Runes-fos] (Foundations of Stone)  \n 1x Deep Knowledge [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Deep-Knowledge-voi] (The Voice of Isengard)  \n 3x Entmoot [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Entmoot-tos] (The Treason of Saruman)  \n 3x Peace, and Thought [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Peace,-and-Thought-saf] (Shadow and Flame)  \n 1x A Good Harvest [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/A-Good-Harvest-tsf] (The Steward's Fear)  \n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191770-new-to-the-game-want-to-build-ent-deck-what-do-i-buy/?do=findComment&comment=1858274","commentId":1858274,"userName":"player2030530","timestamp":1445425837,"content":"You could also check out the New Player Buying Guide from Tales from the Cards [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/]\n\n \n\nIt has extensive information on all the adventure packs/expansions and shows you which are good to buy when looking for certain traits etc.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/191770-new-to-the-game-want-to-build-ent-deck-what-do-i-buy/?do=findComment&comment=1858521","commentId":1858521,"userName":"Thanatopsis","timestamp":1445438028,"content":"I've had a lot of fun using Merry and Pippin heroes from The Black Riders and the Treebeard hero in my lineup.
