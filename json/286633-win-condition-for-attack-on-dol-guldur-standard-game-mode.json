Then, I would do the Forced text on the standard game mode card.  This will put me at a new stage 3, with a lieutenant in play, so I can't win yet.  I will have to get to the end of the round and keep city strength at 0.  At that point, I can choose to return to the quest stage with the lieutenant that I previously destroyed, and immediately win..\n\nWhich seems correct?\nThanks for replies.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/286633-win-condition-for-attack-on-dol-guldur-standard-game-mode/?do=findComment&comment=3544508","commentId":3544508,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1542932645,"content":"You can choose the order of the trigger.
