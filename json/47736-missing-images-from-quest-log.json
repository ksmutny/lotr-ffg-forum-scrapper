Anyway, I'm having some issues with the images: I cannot see the images of any heroes except for the spirit heroes, I cannot see the image of the Mirkwood scenario(although I can see the other two) and I can't see the images of any of the encounter decks that are next to the scenarios. All I see is a square with an X inside. Wondering if anyone is having similar issues and what can be done about it. Aside from that, the log seems to work fine.\n\nÂ "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47736-missing-images-from-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=478715","commentId":478715,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1306964558,"content":"I haven't logged nearly as many as that, but I got alot of no image too. It must be on their end."}]}
