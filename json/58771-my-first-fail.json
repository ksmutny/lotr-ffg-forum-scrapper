These are my thoughts, I hope they help some.  By the way, good job on your 4/4 win ratio! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] Happy Gaming.\n\nJoseph\n\n\"Far over the Misty Mountains cold, to dungeons deep and caverns old, we must away ere break of day,to seek the pale enchanted gold.\" "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58771-my-first-fail/?do=findComment&comment=577870","commentId":577870,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1326259346,"content":"DurinIII said:\n\n \n\nInteresting Rich; when you make 2 sphere decks do you add songs a splash Steward and the Stone?  Or add songs and splash Spirit cards for extra support, or do you just straight up make a 2 color deck?

I chose this approach as this is my first attempt at a card game of any kind. The idea is that it would:\n\n1. help me get used to a card game and how it is played. Even though the game is different, all card games play the same. You have a hand, you have an objective (whether a quest or enemy) and you need to learn to build your hand to best complete the objective.\n\n2. gives me a good idea at what type of cards are in each sphere. I assumed that with each adventure pack, FFG would stay true to the general types of cards in each sphere (tactics = cards for fighters, lore = healing, spirit = questing, etc). Once I had an idea of what each Sphere was all about, I could get into the real strategy of this game which is probably the deck building.\n\nUsing the Passage Thru Mirkwood Quest (unless there is a better one for \"deck testing\"), I have played leadership 4 times.
