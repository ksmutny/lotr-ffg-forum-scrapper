Only an effect that specifically removes a character from a quest can do this. You also must pay to ready him right away, as his ability is a response, meaning that it has a specific trigger and must be activated immediately after the trigger occurs. \n\n2) Correct. Any character killed or otherwise removed from a quest does will no longer count his/her willpower towards the quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55980-quest-resolution-willpower-strength/?do=findComment&comment=553280","commentId":553280,"userName":"gamestar10","timestamp":1320709955,"content":"ravenwolf64 said:\n\nGurus,\n\nI have a few questions regarding Quest resolution and the \"Characters committed to a quest are considered committed to that quest through the end of the quest phase, unless removed from the quest by a card effect.\"\n\n1.

Yes. Readying Aragorn does not remove him from being committed to the quest. As for when to spend the resource, his ability is a response to committing to the quest so must be done at that time.\n\n2. Right. Because the ally wont be in play during quest resolution."}]}
