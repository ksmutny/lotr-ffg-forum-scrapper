I'm assuming nobody would ever consider making a dwarf deck without Dain, so that means all the others get +1 Willpower.\n\nIt's more than enough to sustain you in terms of questing power. Especialy if you factor in that most of your allies (if you take the Lore road with Longbeard Map-Maker, Eerebor Hammersmith and Erebor Records Keeper) are gonna be 2 Willpower for very low cost."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59821-dwarf-deck/?do=findComment&comment=587904","commentId":587904,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1328030390,"content":"SiCK_Boy said:\n\n \n\nBifur and Gloin quest for 3.
