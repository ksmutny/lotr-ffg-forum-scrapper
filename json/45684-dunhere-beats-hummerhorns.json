There's a hummehorns in play, and I've got dunhere. Gonna one shot it with Dunhere and take no damage, or does dunhere's 'attack' count as Hummerhorns 'engaging' me, which would result in 5 damage to a hero?\n\n \n\nThanks! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45684-dunhere-beats-hummerhorns/?do=findComment&comment=458244","commentId":458244,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1303602462,"content":"Well, basically yes.\n\nJust keep in mind that before Dunhere can shoot, there is the encounter phase where you have to check whether or not the hummerhorns engage.

Dunhere rides up and proper murders them.  My teammate did that tonight. \n\nDunhere can attack enemies in the staging area without them becoming engaged.
