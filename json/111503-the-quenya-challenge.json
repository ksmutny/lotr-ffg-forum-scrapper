A course is fine to learn the basics but something like this should be trialed or it will wither.\n\nIf someone feels up to try and translate it and, more importantly, I have succeeded in making myself understood, that would be really cool. I should say that I purposefully have made the choice to try out some different grammatical compositions, the better to test myself.\n\nI will post my english version of the letter in a few days for comparison.\n\n \n\nAnd a final note: The last word \"camda\" is not an official word. But lacking one from the sources I used, I instead opted to make this word out of the words \"(ca)nta\", \"ra(m)ba\" and \"pan(da)\".\n\n \n\nquenya-letter.jpg [http://pdfcast.org/images/s/6293/quenya-letter.jpg]\n\nHave fun (hopefully)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111503-the-quenya-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=1166592","commentId":1166592,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1406104794,"content":"i cant understand it (unfortunatly :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png]   ) but i liked this post for your awesome dedication!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111503-the-quenya-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=1167456","commentId":1167456,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1406151008,"content":"And I thank you for your attention, Rich :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nHantanyel = I give thanks to you (or just thank you)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111503-the-quenya-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=1167527","commentId":1167527,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1406154313,"content":"Are the first two words something relating to \"Faithful Friend?\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111503-the-quenya-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=1167921","commentId":1167921,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1406181527,"content":"> Are the first two words something relating to \"Faithful Friend?\"\n\nIndeed they are :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nMore precisely \"My Steadfast Friend\" (steadfast according to the source I used; guess faithful works equally fine)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111503-the-quenya-challenge/?do=findComment&comment=1167925","commentId":1167925,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1406182153,"content":"i can not help you.. and while learning Klingon or elvish is about the same level of crazy, I also think it is pretty cool.
