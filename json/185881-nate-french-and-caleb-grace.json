I would say Nate laid the foundation for all the traits that Caleb is currently building. Remember the core set: it related traits to spheres and spheres to strategies. With HoN/AtS (for instance) Caleb is building the Gondor, Rohan, ranger, trap and Hobbit traits. All of which had a \"sneak peek\" in the core set. Remember Nate developed Dwarves, Noldor, spirit Rohan and other great trait stuff in mirkwood, KD, and Dwarrodelf.\n\nIf you want a difference I suppose you could say Nate is passionate about making a thematic fun game with lots of synergy that requires players to be cleaver in how they build decks, while Caleb is passionate about integrating deeper LOTR lore into the game while keeping adventures interesting and keeping players on their toes.\n\nUltimately their passions allign and we are fortunate to have such excellent, player centered developers working on a game we love (mostly because we see them return that love)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185881-nate-french-and-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1749442","commentId":1749442,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1440267615,"content":"Very well put, flightmaster. I'm fond of the diversity of the cards and quests released so far. And either Nate always had a plan for each trait, or Caleb and Matt are very good at making older, seemingly stray cards parts of new archetypes. Dúnedain engage and Noldor discard, for instance. There is a great blend of mechanics and theme. I hope Caleb and Matt will stay on as developers for as long as they can."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185881-nate-french-and-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1749462","commentId":1749462,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1440268954,"content":"And don't forget that Nate still has lots of input in the current quests and gives advice to Caleb and Matt."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185881-nate-french-and-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1749494","commentId":1749494,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1440270732,"content":"Another difference: the history line since third cycle (Alcaron Traitor, Mugash captured, Iarion's search...)\n\n \n\nWhat else?\n\nEdited August 22, 2015 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185881-nate-french-and-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1749616","commentId":1749616,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1440276951,"content":"I think there was a 2nd designer before Caleb and after Nate who developed HoN & the AtS cycle?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185881-nate-french-and-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1749781","commentId":1749781,"userName":"jnicol","timestamp":1440286188,"content":"> I think there was a 2nd designer before Caleb and after Nate who developed HoN & the AtS cycle?\n\n \n\nLukas Litzsinger is credited on BGG as co-designer of Khazad-dûm and Dwarrowdelf (with Nate French) and co-designer of Heirs of Númenor and Against the Shadow (with Nate French and Caleb Grace).
