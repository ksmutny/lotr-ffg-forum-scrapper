Is this true? If it is true, I guess that means we won't see any quests that directly relate to the plot in the books. It certainly explains why this flagship game has so far failed to include the main questline from the books.\n\nAssuming that this is true and not just rumor, what material could FFG draw from to create interesting quests in future expansions?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58341-lotrlcg-will-not-cover-the-story-in-the-books/?do=findComment&comment=573929","commentId":573929,"userName":"t_rothlisberger","timestamp":1325537665,"content":"Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't we already making connections with the 'core story' helping Gandalf hunt Gollum?
