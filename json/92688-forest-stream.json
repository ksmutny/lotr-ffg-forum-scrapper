Can you active the response or not? Because there is a treachery in CORE that reads: Remove 4 progress tokens from the current quest card. (If there are fewer then 4 progress tokens on the quest, remove all progress tokens from that quest.)\n\n \n\nM1086.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1086.png]\n\n \n\nIt must be written?\n\n \n\nPD: and other question: if you have 4 poison but you are interested in discard only 3 (for example, to avoid the surge of Poisoned by Spiders -see above-), can you do so or you must discard 4 as it reads?\n\n \n\nM1657.png [http://www.lotrlcg.com/Images/Cards/Medium/M1657.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92688-forest-stream/?do=findComment&comment=897913","commentId":897913,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1382953704,"content":"Text in parenthesis are a rule reminder.
