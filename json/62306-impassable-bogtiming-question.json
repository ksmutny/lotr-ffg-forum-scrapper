From the thread over at cardgamedb (http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications-updated-27012012/page__p__4136#entry4136 [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/index.php?/topic/1702-official-nate-rule-clarifications-updated-27012012/page__p__4136#entry4136]):\n\nQuestion Submitted by \"guciomir @ FFG\"\n\nQ:- The impassable bog reads: when revelead, add 1 token to gollum for every location in the staging area. When this text is triggered, is the just-revealed Bog considered in the staging area? In other words, does the Bog count itself as a location in the staging area?\n\nA: - Encounter cards are revealed from the encounter deck, their \"When Revealed\" effects are resolved, and the card is then placed in the staging area. So the Bog has not yet entered the staging area when its effects resolve.\n\n---\n\nSo, according to Nate, the Bog does NOT count itself. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62306-impassable-bogtiming-question/?do=findComment&comment=609967","commentId":609967,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332682672,"content":"holy fish sticks- i got one right..........lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif] so thats won 2 lost 50........haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62306-impassable-bogtiming-question/?do=findComment&comment=610005","commentId":610005,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1332691513,"content":"I had to dig up the ruling for a thread over on BGG this weekend, so I remembered this much at least."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62306-impassable-bogtiming-question/?do=findComment&comment=610040","commentId":610040,"userName":"lexlloyd","timestamp":1332701294,"content":"Thanks to everyone who replied!  Rich I laughed out loud at your second post :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62306-impassable-bogtiming-question/?do=findComment&comment=610049","commentId":610049,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1332704536,"content":"its soo true though haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62306-impassable-bogtiming-question/?do=findComment&comment=610101","commentId":610101,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1332724294,"content":" Well, that makes sense then. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] I don't mind being wrong if it is for something that is sensible."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62306-impassable-bogtiming-question/?do=findComment&comment=610492","commentId":610492,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1332808635,"content":"this was answered by nate, when revealed effects occur before it is placed on the table.. so the way it works for this card and ALL staging area cards is that teh effects triggers on the cards that are already in play.. not the current card.\n\nSo imaging a arrow pointing backward form the card your draw... not including the drawn card... it will effect everything under that arrow. This DOSE include cards revealed in turn.. so in a 3 player game if bog is drawn as the 2nd card drawn (you draw 3 each quest phase in a 3 player game) then the effect will only effect those behind it.. so c1, c2, c3 and new card 1, but not itself or new card 3\n\n<-----------------------xxxxxxxxxx\n\nC1, C2, C3,  NC1, NC2, NC3\n\n \n\n7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]"}]}
