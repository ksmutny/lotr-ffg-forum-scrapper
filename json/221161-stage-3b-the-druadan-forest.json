If an enemy would be damaged this way, place progress tokens on it instead of damage tokens. When an enemy has progress equal to its hit points, add it to the victory display and place those progress tokens on the quest.\n \n\n> Hi! \n> \n>  \n> \n> If an enemy has 4 printed hit points can it be added to the victory display in the following situations?\n> \n>  \n> \n> 1) 4 progress, 0 damage\n> \n> 2) 3 progress, 1 damage\n> \n> 3) 2 progress, 2 damage\n> \n> 4) 1 progress, 3 damage\n> \n> 5) 0 progress, 4 damage\n> \n>  \n> \n> I ask because the Core Set rules say that damage tokens give a character/enemy -1 hit point and the Stage 3B quest card does not specify whether it refers to remaining hit points or printed hit points.\n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> Hi Chris,\n> In order to add an enemy to the victory display at stage 3B, you need to place progress on that enemy equal to its printed hit points. So damage on an enemy will not reduce the amount of progress you need to put on that enemy at stage 3B.\n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221161-stage-3b-the-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=2241125","commentId":2241125,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1464610895,"content":"So... there is a magical \"printed\" word that pop out of nowehere? :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221161-stage-3b-the-druadan-forest/?do=findComment&comment=2242048","commentId":2242048,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1464665606,"content":"\"Hit points\" is different than \"remaining hit points\" is different than \"printed hit points\".\n\n \n\nPrinted Hit Points: The number it says on the card.\n\nRemaining Hit Points: How much more damage an enemy must take before being killed.\n\nJust Hit Points: The total number of damage it takes to kill an enemy.

The Core Set Rulebook actually states that the damage tokens give the character -1 Hit Point.  So under your interpretation that would mean the above situations would actually discard the enemy contrary to Caleb's ruling. \n\n \n\nI think this is simply an example of the Stage 3B card being worded poorly and it should read \"printed hit points\"."}]}
