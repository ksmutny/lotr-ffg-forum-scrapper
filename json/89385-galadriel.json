Galadriel had seen very ages, lived amongst the Valar and learnt from them. Elrond had a kind of lore alike but he was much younger and he had not seen Valinor.\n\n \n\nGlorfindel was different. Presumably he was the most powerful elf during the Third Age but specially in combat and facing the evil forces. After his death in Gondolin, he was returned to life by the Valar in Valinor. They made him more powerful, almost as a Maiar, and sent him back to Middle Earth to fight against Sauron and to give strength to Gil Galad and Elrond. He would be like an angel or saint amongst the elves: purged from his sins and renewed. He was the only thing that the Witch King feared. Indeed he was supposed to be the captain of the elves in the last fight against the shadow in case of a failure of the fellowship of the ring. That's the reason why he didn't join the fellowship.\n\nEdited September 14, 2013 by asfaloth"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=866389","commentId":866389,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1379196991,"content":"I'm not sure about stats and i agree that she would have a high threat cost... ability wise:\n\n \n\nhow about something like the following:\n\n \n\n(Maybe time x) Exhaust Galadriel to look at x encounter cards, put back on top of the deck in any order you choose.

I have increased her cost and reduced her base willpower to 2 because I think it might otherwise  become too powerful, but this would still allow some shenanigans through Faramir, Elrond's Counsel or Children of the Sea if you wanted to develop this into a major deck theme.\n\n \n\nEver since the appearance of Denethor and his ability in the core set I have regarded questing as a fairly fluid concept where not necessarily every character providing willpower to the quest is actually running through a forest. So I would not mind having Galadriel as an active quester, but I can see where other people may have a different opinion.\n\nEdited September 16, 2013 by ClydeCloggie"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89385-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=868640","commentId":868640,"userName":"Legolas of Darkwood","timestamp":1379444071,"content":"> I think besides willpower (representing her magic and wisdom) her physical stats should be low.
