I think people just like to complain. Like they are all made at the same factories using the same printers. Sure Death Angle print on demand is slightly different.. I mean it was years latter it isn't uprising there is a different.. but slightly different doesn't equate to lower quality. All these cards come form the exact same place... IF there is a difference.. and I am curious to see your photos, then my guess is that you got a bad run.. it happens in pressing.\n\n7775589.png [http://www1.picturepush.com/photo/a/7775589/img/7775589.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61880-lotr-cards-seem-poorly-made-compared-to-agot/?do=findComment&comment=607639","commentId":607639,"userName":"dcdennis","timestamp":1332193282,"content":" I was told NA and EU use different printers."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61880-lotr-cards-seem-poorly-made-compared-to-agot/?do=findComment&comment=607651","commentId":607651,"userName":"dcdennis","timestamp":1332194910,"content":" Ok, so I was actually bored enough tonight to do a complete investigation of this issue tonight and have come to a few conclusions. \n\n \n\n1. The cards are identical, or near enough as make no difference, in composition. I closed my eyes and had my wife hand me one of each, and I could not tell the difference, and neither could she.\n\n2. I believe now that the difference in quality is perceived because of two reasons:\n\n          A) The LotR cards have no border, making for a less neat appearance than the aGoT cards. There is nothing wrong with this, but it plays tricks on the eyes, making the cards appear thinner.\n\n          B) aGoT cards all have the same symmetrical curvature to them (whether this is how they are pressed or packaged I do not know). By this I mean if you place them flat on a surface, all four corners of the card will actually be off the table, and the only part of the card actually making contact with the surface is a line down the center of the card. The LotR cards do not have this. The curvature to these cards is more diagonal, where if you place them on a flat surface, two opposite corners of the card actually make contact with the table. This is demonstrated in the oversized image below. You can see the two different cards, both unplayed and taken right out of the plastic for this image.
