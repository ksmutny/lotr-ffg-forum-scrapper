Each of the spheres has its own strengths and weaknesses. With a little practice, you'll be able to tailor your strategy to the advantages and disadvantages of your decks. Take the scenario you presented: Tactics and Leadership. Between the two of you, you can generate lots of resources, boost your characters' stats, and destroy enemies very effectively. You will have trouble healing wounds, drawing cards, canceling effects, and managing threat (as those are the strengths of Lore and Spirit, respectively).
