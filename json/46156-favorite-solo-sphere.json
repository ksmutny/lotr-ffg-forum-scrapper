And, when it comes down to it, Threat is the most important 'currency' in the game. Though Sneak/Gandalf is a powerful combo, I really think that Galadrim's Greeting/Dwarven Tomb/Will of the West is far stronger, and I'm fairly sure that at some point Dwarven Tomb is going to be altered so that it removes itself from the game once used.\n\nSo yeah, Spirit ftw."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464963","commentId":464963,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1304774652,"content":"Yes i enjoy spirit cards more than any other sphere.Leadership is more powerfull now and as a Gandalf fan i enjoy sneak+Gandalf but generaly spirit is more interesting than any other sphere and i love the art on spirit cards.\n\nI can't wait Radagast to comes live and make a deck with spirit sphere and Radagast with his beasts.Also i can't wait for Galadriel.She and Gandalf  will allways have 6 spots in my decksgran_risa.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gran_risa.gif]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464981","commentId":464981,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1304778112,"content":"So far my favourite to play has been Lore.  The healing along with event and shadow card peeks are really useful.  Plus you get a good spread of stas on the Heroes.  3 Defence on Denethor, 3 Attack on Glorfindal and 2 Attack on Berevor makes it pretty decent in combat.\n\nLooking forward to giving old Bilbo a go with it soon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=464989","commentId":464989,"userName":"ArachneJericho","timestamp":1304779022,"content":"HyenaSpotz said:\n\nLeadership is hands down the best sphere in the game so far, without contest.

I made some mistakes along the way so that didn't help, but I did have one game where I got close to getting past the first scenario. Then I tried the Tactics Sphere a couple times and while they could kick the snot out of enemies, they didn't do so well questing and gaining resources. Finally I tried the Spirit Sphere and got smoked in one game, I got close the next and then finally just beat the first scenario. I know that's not much to brag about considering how well others have done, but it was a great sense of accomplishment and fun. I was able to get to the 3rd phase where I had to find a Spider and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn and got it out there and had a couple rounds to use Dunhere to put wounds on it while it was in the staging. Then I brought out Gandalf to lay 4 wounds on Ungo and then put 2 more on it in combat.

Lol.\n\nGlad to hear you did manage a success early. I think the first one with each color is the most satisfying, because each sphere plays so differently. It just feels gratifying when you are able to switch gears and win with a completely different strategy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=468452","commentId":468452,"userName":"Hahma","timestamp":1305385044,"content":"Thanks for the response Mestrahd happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif] Yeah, in the games I've played, I've certainly found the differences in the spheres (except Lore which I have yet to play). I agree that it's to use different strategies so that it can be a different experience.\n\nI have 8 year-old twin daughters that I've had playing Heroscape for awhile now and have just gotten them into Dominion (as I have just gotten into that too). They love the LOTR movies and when I showed them the demo video they were really interested. I told them that I have to play it several times so I can learn it well enough to teach them. What I'll do, as I did with Dominion, is that I'll have them play and I'll just teach and coach them until they get a better grasp. Dominion was easy enough but since you discard your hand every turn, you don't need as much forethought on when to use certain cards. But I think they'll do alright. I also play Summoner Wars with my 15 year-old nephew (as well as Heroscape and Dominion) and just got Thunderstone Dragonspire to learn and play with him. I hope to teach my girls both of those games in the future as well. I'd love to get Game of Thrones the card game as I've read the book series and loved it, but no one else I know is into it, so I likely won't get that game.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46156-favorite-solo-sphere/?do=findComment&comment=468685","commentId":468685,"userName":"Hahma","timestamp":1305443341,"content":"I played my first 2 player game last night with my nephew. He had Leadership and I had Spirit. We got smoked. I played the card to lower his Threat by 6 but that cost me as I got engaged and attacked a lot and after losing a hero I couldn't get much resource. I should have used the resource instead to get an ally for me as Leadership can deal with enemy better. I also read the rules again more carefully and found that we messed up and I was counting threat of engaged enemy while questing, no wonder we couldn't make any progress.\n\nWhile that wasn't solo play related, I did try Spirit sphere in a solo game this morning and played correctly when questing and I got through the first sphere. I had to find and defeat Ungoliant's Spawn at the end, but fortunately I had drawn Gandalf and then used Stand and Fight to get him back in play. That is huge for the Spirit sphere as they don't have good attacks to take down the heavy hitters."}]}
