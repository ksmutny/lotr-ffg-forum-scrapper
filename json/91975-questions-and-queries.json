Aragorn's power is a response which has to be triggered immediatly after he committed to a quest. However, you can use Theodred's reaction to give Aragorn the additional resource, because you can choose in which order you want to resolve Aragorn's and Theodred's reaction. Theodred's response also triggers right after you commit him to the quest.\n\n \n\n2) Basically yes. You can play event cards that have an action everytime an action window is open. Check the rulebook to see when that is possible (almost all of the time). And yes, you only pay the resource for Sneak Attack to bring that ally into the game.\n\n \n\n3) Yes, except when the card text says that the location is immune to player card effects.\n\n \n\n4) To reduce the amount of threat in the staging area. Some enemies have a high threat value but can be easily defeated. When you play with the tactics sphere you basically have to do that, if you want to have a chance to win (don't play with  tactics btw, the sphere doesn't have enough WP to make enough progress in most quests). Also, Legolas gives you additional progress by killing enemies.\n\n \n\n5) No, you only exhaust Steward of Gondor.\n\n \n\n6) Like I said before, it depends on the keyword. Actions can be played almost everytime, reactions are triggered by events that are explained on the event card, and they have to be resolved immediatly after the event takes place. Some cards have actions that are limited to certain phases of the game (travel action, combat action etc).\n\n \n\n7) Lol, no. Steward of Gondor has the unique symbol, so you can only have one of them in play (but you can have multiple copies in your hand).\n\n \n\n8) Yes.\n\n \n\n9) You cheated by using two Stewards of Gondor. That's like having two popes. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] However, Steward of Gondor and Grim Resolve are a great combo. The further helps you to spare enough resources to play the latter. And yes, the first quest is meant to be easier than the rest. Be warned that th third quest Escape from dol Guldur is (almost) impossible to win solo. Better play that one two handed.\n\n \n\n10) i just wanted to add a tenth point to make me feel like Moses. :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91975-questions-and-queries/?do=findComment&comment=887732","commentId":887732,"userName":"iznax","timestamp":1381659857,"content":"You can't have 2 Stewards of Gondor in play, or in Middle Earth in general :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91975-questions-and-queries/?do=findComment&comment=888215","commentId":888215,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1381738205,"content":">  \n> \n> 9) You cheated by using two Stewards of Gondor.
