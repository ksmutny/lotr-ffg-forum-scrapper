Also, do I resolve the combat during the normal combat round or when Son of Arnor engages the Forest Spider?\n\n \n\nThanks!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65765-question-about-son-of-arnor/?do=findComment&comment=642537","commentId":642537,"userName":"Ulairi","timestamp":1339318934,"content":" sorry for the tripple post. "}]}
