He has maggoty sallow skin, greasy hair, and a goatee. It is truly one of the strangest art choices I've seen in the entire life of the game. The art of the treachery \"Ulchor's Rage\" really shows his ensemble in all of its glory. \n\nIs this a reference to something I'm completely missing? Is he a strange Mad Max ripoff? What is going on with Ulchor? \n\n \n\nEDIT: Oh... it's him. I retract my questions, but still think that is without a doubt the worst get-up in the game. \n\nEdited February 15 by pmdoug"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305833-what-is-up-with-thane-ulchors-art/?do=findComment&comment=3894739","commentId":3894739,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1581777524,"content":"What I want to know more about is that crackling sword!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/305833-what-is-up-with-thane-ulchors-art/?do=findComment&comment=3894758","commentId":3894758,"userName":"MikeGracey","timestamp":1581781770,"content":"I dont mind his art at all.
