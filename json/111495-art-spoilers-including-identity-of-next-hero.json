You may be right and certainly a Legolas taking advantage of the Silvan trait would be beneficial. But it would be about time for art spoilers coming out for those in the Road Darkens Saga...which I personally don't think Legolas will be in, I have my money on an ally boromir so you can two-fist the fellowship!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/111495-art-spoilers-including-identity-of-next-hero/?do=findComment&comment=1167619","commentId":1167619,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1406158293,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > Were the other two pictures taken down already?

I really hope they never create 3 different versions of any unique character. It's bad enough with 2, especially in multiplayer. There are tons of characters and they've shown they aren't afraid to invent more, so I'd rather not see them create more restrictions like not letting me use my Faramir ally because someone wants to try the hero."}]}
