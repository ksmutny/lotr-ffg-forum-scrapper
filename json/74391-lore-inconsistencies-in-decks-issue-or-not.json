Now they are great, powerful cards - but during the time period the LOTR game is set (as opposed to The Hobbit) those characters are very much dead, including Fili and Kili. However Nori, Bofur and other Dwarves from the twelve are alive. \n\n Am I just being pedantic if I feel characters that died during the Hobbit are not usable in the LOTR quests? Or, with the introduction of the hobbit, is it assumed that from The Hobbit to the beginning of LOTR is entirely open to alternative events?\n\n I find that hard to believe personally, due to Kazadum being an entire expansion to find what happened to Balin, and Ori was (according to the Books) there. Now if I was playing with a stranger I don't think I would take issue - but doesn't it seem appropriate to take the deaths of certain characters in the Hobbit to be pretty definitive, and playing them during LOTR quests to be inappropriate, continuity-wise? Or should we take the fact that the end of the Hobbit (in card release terms) hasn't happened - and that Balin (who pertinently doesn't have a card) is the only character who has to have *definitively* died in the \"LOTR: The Card Game\" - to mean that Thorin & Ori might have survived in *our* personal version of \"The Hobbit\" and \"LOTR\"?\n\nWhat do you think? Does the introduction of Hobbit cards mean that events in the Hobbit are open to different outcomes? Are Thorin, Ori, Fili and Kili definitely dead when the \"LOTR: The Card Game\" begin, or could they have survived?\n\nMost importantly, am I over-thinking this? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74391-lore-inconsistencies-in-decks-issue-or-not/?do=findComment&comment=724370","commentId":724370,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1353058367,"content":"this was dicussed alot when the game came out- basically alot of people thought this game was set in a certain time period….but i think that has gone now\n\nit seems much more open HOWEVER remember that the hobbit boxes are saga sets, not linked to the main game, so it is therefore really up to you how much you follow lore\n\ni prefer this way then everyone can set their own standards of following the lore\n\npersonally i go for lore friendly decks, but dont mind throwing in an odd card here and there which needs some imagination to figure out why it would be there\n\ni do not think though that the game tries to set any alternative events, just linear ones to the books\n\ni tend to split my games up into two types\n\n-ones where i take characters likely to be together and put them through a quest (eg. the twins and aragorn with a dunedain noldor deck)\n\n-ones where lore flies right out of the window\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74391-lore-inconsistencies-in-decks-issue-or-not/?do=findComment&comment=724373","commentId":724373,"userName":"HeavyKaragh","timestamp":1353059321,"content":"demonsbanenathan said:\n\n Most importantly, am I over-thinking this? \n\nYes.
