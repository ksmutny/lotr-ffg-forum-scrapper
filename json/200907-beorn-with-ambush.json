The ability on Ambush allows you (the player) to make an attack against the attached enemy. Once the attack is initiated, it resolves like a normal attack, which Beorn can participate in. \nThe type of attack that Beorn could not participate in, would be an attack initiated by Quick Strike. That’s because Quick Strike instructs you to exhaust a character you control in order to declare that character as an attacker. Beorn’s immunity would prevent you from targeting him with that effect.\nCheers,\nCaleb\"\n\nEdited February 1, 2016 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200907-beorn-with-ambush/?do=findComment&comment=2026563","commentId":2026563,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1454361634,"content":"Now I'm going to have to make a Beorn Ambush deck :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200907-beorn-with-ambush/?do=findComment&comment=2026634","commentId":2026634,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1454363815,"content":"Yeah I put together a deck called \"Bear Trap.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200907-beorn-with-ambush/?do=findComment&comment=2028264","commentId":2028264,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1454434760,"content":"I have another Beorn related question:\n\n \n\nCan Honour Guard and Close Call prevent damage being dealt to Beorn?\n\n \n\nHonour Guard text: Response: Exhaust Honour Guard to cancel the first point of damage just dealt to a character.\n\nClose Call text: Response: Cancel X damage just dealt to a hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200907-beorn-with-ambush/?do=findComment&comment=2028342","commentId":2028342,"userName":"cmabr002","timestamp":1454436197,"content":"> I have another Beorn related question:\n> \n>  \n> \n> Can Honour Guard and Close Call prevent damage being dealt to Beorn?\n> \n>  \n> \n> Honour Guard text: Response: Exhaust Honour Guard to cancel the first point of damage just dealt to a character.\n> \n> Close Call text: Response: Cancel X damage just dealt to a hero.\n\n \n\nI believe it has been ruled that Honour Guard can.  Due to this, I think Close Call should be able to as well.   Both effects seem to target the damage (like Dori does)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200907-beorn-with-ambush/?do=findComment&comment=2028352","commentId":2028352,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1454436390,"content":"Yep.  Cards that target the damage are legal with Beorn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/200907-beorn-with-ambush/?do=findComment&comment=2028858","commentId":2028858,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1454448904,"content":"Yeah, actually this was the impetus for the Bear Trap deck I mentioned.  I wanted to have Beorn out and avoid damage, so Honour Guard of course, but so often it's hard to get Honour Guard out on the table as early as you need him.  Damrod and his traps are very good at helping you draw cards.  In addition to that, Ambush lets you avoid an attack altogether, so even better for Beorn.  I add in Tactics Aragorn for the third hero (more attack avoidance is possible, and the -defense on Aragorn is pretty much the only way to make Beorn stronger)."}]}
