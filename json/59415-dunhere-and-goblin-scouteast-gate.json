Run with Thalin and a few Marks, UCs as well if you can, and you should have very strong control of the staging area."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59415-dunhere-and-goblin-scouteast-gate/?do=findComment&comment=583712","commentId":583712,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1327337381,"content":" Heroes do not engage enemies, players do.  Dunhere is in no way \"engaging\" the Goblin Scout when he attacks it.  Neither East Gate nor the Scout's text interfere with Dunhere, no more than they would interfere with Gandalf blowing up the goblin."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59415-dunhere-and-goblin-scouteast-gate/?do=findComment&comment=583752","commentId":583752,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327340969,"content":"radiskull said:\n\nno more than they would interfere with Gandalf blowing up the goblin.\n\n\n\nhaha thanks for the image!"}]}
