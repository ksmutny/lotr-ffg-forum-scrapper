Absolutely loved this cycle overall and really enjoyed the last two quests regardless of difficulty unlike the last cycle. Storm on Cobas Haven and City of Corsairs were both difficult but didn't feel unfair or impossible like Carn Dum did or Dream Realm could at times. You can get crazy starting rounds with more enemy ships than you can handle but it still never feels anywhere near as ridiculous or difficult as Carn Dum or Dread Realm.\n\n \n\nStorm on Cobas Haven was a great quest and I feel like they did the Naval battle really well. I suffered almost countless losses before I could get this one under control and even the win I did eventually get was extremely close. My decks were definitely not well suited to this one and it showed big time, I did get there eventually though and although it was frustrating at times most of the games were really fun.\n\nManaged to beat City of Corsairs by rushing the first stage as fast as possible (building up forces and feinting enemy ships when possible) and then slowly beating stage 3 over the course of several turns trying to amass forces as much as possible then battling Sahir and his corsairs over several turns on stage 4 until I was able to utterly destroy him (with 10 or so damage to spare). Really enjoyed this quest (more than Cobas Haven although the epic naval battle was pretty great) and think the way that going from sea to land is handled is really clever and works flawlessly. I definitely found it much easier to rush the first stage by questing hard and staying on course than to try and battle it out at sea and destroy the Stormcaller. If you have a clear board state when you get to Stage 3 you only have to add a resource to a few corsair enemies for not destroying the Stormcaller so there is really not much of a setback. I found that you need to consistently attack Sahir as well as other corsairs in play so that you keep his resource level as low as possible especially considering defeated corsairs add their resource to him. Absolutely loved the way the story ended and the cool backstory we got for Na'aisayah and also the backstory for the chest and its contents! Was awesome to get a tale however brief set in Numenor before its fall!\n\nCannot wait for the new cycle and loving this game so much right now (just recently committed to using the Galadriel hero properly for the first time ever and used her to beat City of Corsairs among several other random quests).\n\nEdited November 6, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/232239-city-of-the-corsairs/?do=findComment&comment=2490655","commentId":2490655,"userName":"Rob_Oz","timestamp":1478447001,"content":"Agree with PsychoRoka about the difficulty of this cycle's final quests vis-a-vis Carn Dum and Dread Realm. I really enjoyed the Angmar Awakened Cycle, but never did play either Carn Dum or Dread Realm because they were so difficult and thus required specific deck building. I also happened to be really busy when they released, so between lack of time and the demands of those quests they still sit in my encounter deck box waiting to be played. I intend to try them at some point, but FFG pumps out LOTR:LCG content quickly enough for my schedule that I find it difficult to go back to old quests and stay current at the same time. I still need to play Pelennor Fields properly, am trying to get through City of the Corsairs, and have the Fellowship event occurring next weekend in my area. And while the Upcoming page says \"on the boat\", in the blink of an eye Sands of Harad will hit! I also work, have a family, and enjoy plenty of other table top games. So yeah, the whole time thing. What's the phrase - time is the fire in which we burn? But I digress. I thought the last two Dreamchaser quests did a solid job of balancing challenge with play-ability.\n\n \n\nOn a side note, I think my favorite experience in Storm on Cobas Haven was flipping over the Corsair Skirmisher. Loved that after you defeated it, you could pull it over to your side.\n\nEdited November 8, 2016 by RobOz"}]}
