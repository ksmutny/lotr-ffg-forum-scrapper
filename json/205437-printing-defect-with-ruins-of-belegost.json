That is, the titles are along the same edge of the card.\n\nMy RoB quest cards need to be flipped vertically for proper orientation. The card titles are on opposite edges.\n\nI suppose this is a defect, but it's not a big deal. I'm more curious to know, does anyone else has this issue?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205437-printing-defect-with-ruins-of-belegost/?do=findComment&comment=2099571","commentId":2099571,"userName":"Delaric","timestamp":1457925547,"content":"If it ends up being a bigger issue you may want to notify FFG's Lead Image Flippist.  I don't have his e-mail but found the staff photo:\n\n \n\n0455974_1272_MC_Tx304.jpg [http://cdn5.movieclips.com/mgm/s/spaceballs-1987/0455974_1272_MC_Tx304.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205437-printing-defect-with-ruins-of-belegost/?do=findComment&comment=2099617","commentId":2099617,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1457929015,"content":"> If it ends up being a bigger issue you may want to notify FFG's Lead Image Flippist.  I don't have his e-mail but found the staff photo:\n> \n>  \n> \n> 0455974_1272_MC_Tx304.jpg [http://cdn5.movieclips.com/mgm/s/spaceballs-1987/0455974_1272_MC_Tx304.jpg]\n\nLooks like an @$$hole"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205437-printing-defect-with-ruins-of-belegost/?do=findComment&comment=2175280","commentId":2175280,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1460996467,"content":"My pack had 4 copies of Cave Dweller [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Nameless-Cave-Dweller-TRoB] instead of 3."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/205437-printing-defect-with-ruins-of-belegost/?do=findComment&comment=2175314","commentId":2175314,"userName":"DurinVoronwe","timestamp":1460997637,"content":"Isn´t the encounter cards numbered?
