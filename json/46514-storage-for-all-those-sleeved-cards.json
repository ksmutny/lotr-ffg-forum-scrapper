The insert provided by FFG is pretty useless, and I'm considering getting deck boxes to store my personal deck, the encounter deck, and the other player and quest cards. 3 deck boxes per box, if they fit, seems to be what I'm aiming at. Any brand recommendations?\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46514-storage-for-all-those-sleeved-cards/?do=findComment&comment=465668","commentId":465668,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1304936772,"content":"I have been using elastics and the core set box for now but will be picking up a regular white cardboard card  storage box to hold them in once more come out.
