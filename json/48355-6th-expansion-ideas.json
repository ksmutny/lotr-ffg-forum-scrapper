And of course a new quest-chain of three quests and assorted encounter decks.\n\nIt will be great if it will include a third threat counter (and marketable as a 3 player expansion...)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48355-6th-expansion-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=485027","commentId":485027,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1308037971,"content":"Have any other LCGs released a deluxe pack after their first cycle of expansions?

I wager they might have one  delux to start off each cycle.\n\nI say this because we have the core which gives us the base for the quests. If they are to give us a delux witha  few different quests, doesnt it seem logical that they will be the first ones of the quest like the core set..?\n\n \n\nthoughts on that idea?"}]}
