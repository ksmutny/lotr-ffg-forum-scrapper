I have constructed a tier list of how experienced you are with the game and how involved you are with its community. On top of that, I also added several achievements for people to collect over their time playing this game.Â https://visionofthepalantir.com/â€¦/levels-of-lotr-lcg-playeâ€¦/ [https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fvisionofthepalantir.com%2F2019%2F06%2F02%2Flevels-of-lotr-lcg-players%2F%3Ffbclid%3DIwAR2rTX35eqVP0DorJ7WmzIXBheJF4Cq9GT0_703H1UMsW7aPoROUCjkZRcg&h=AT0Qa4wNyTEZCwYhMxQSOr7tvlHKlWwrF7JJxhdzHVg9TfobP2sBZOOkWdAaK5Eb5MvvTtr0LoWpEZ4xCYP6jTfeYdzqSYdkMbf6wcCgtMfTi6kWHQY1fXsUmyq01TOWBnhCDwowpN7jfd_Xfy0qB6ys]\n\nIf you have more tips for players at different levels or want to add more achievements to the list, let me know and I'll see what I can do. Also, be sure to fill in the two polls I included.\n\nRegular scenario analyses should continue soon, and with Patreon nearing the $75Â mark, I am gonna start working on the second physical strategy guide as well and release it once we hit that amount of support.

Was nice to read and it is good to know that someone tries to make categories of player behaviour. (That sentence of mine might not sound in a positive way, but it is ment to be positive - not native speaker here. Sorry) Well, but I do think that there is missing a step between dedicated player and master. Between the other categories the \"steps\" are smaller.Â \n\nI would call me a dedicated player, but there is much more to explore before *baam* suddenly master. :D (in your categories I would be stuck at the tier which \"requires\" to go to conventions, open game events and such)\n\nIn my experience there are somewhat minor and major dedicated players. Dunno how to name them. Probably the difference is one is a gaming addicted geek and the other one just plays very, very often.\n\n> 10 hours ago, Calvadur said:\n> \n> Â \n> \n> I think more achievements for actually playing the game or achieving (hehe) some special \"objectives\"Â Â would be cool.

But I decided to cut it, as the tips were just going to be: \"Get better and buy more content\". I might adjust the article to include my Veteran level at one point, though it will have some consequences for the polls. The steps between the others are indeed smaller, though not small enough for some players to fall in between the two levels.\n\nÂ \n\n> 32 minutes ago, Flrbb said:\n> \n> Is it on purpose that your link refers to a Facebook link which refers to your blog?\n\nIt wasn't, but that's probably because I copied the post from the post in the facebook group. It shouldn't be a huge issue, but I'll keep an eye on it in the future.\n\nÂ \n\n@Calvadur [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/258336-calvadur/]Â That's a pretty sweet list there. I will look over them at some point and may include some achievements to the list. They are a bit smaller and scenario specific though, so perhaps I could add each one to the end of the matching scenario analysis. Just to give people a challenge when playing that scenario. There are some pretty nice achievements in there that are easier to obtain than those in the article, thanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295909-levels-of-lotr-lcg-players/?do=findComment&comment=3713879","commentId":3713879,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1559585142,"content":"> 22 hours ago, Calvadur said:\n> \n> 6) I don't need no heroes...: Win Foundations of stone after/while controlling zero heroes\n\nIsn't this a loss condition?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/295909-levels-of-lotr-lcg-players/?do=findComment&comment=3713890","commentId":3713890,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1559586156,"content":"> 14 minutes ago, player3351457 said:\n> \n> Isn't this a loss condition?\n\nNo. FAQ on the Lost and Alone treachery of that quest:\n\n\n\n> If your last hero gets shuffled into your deck you are not eliminated from the game; heroes are not considered to be killed unless they are in your discard pile.
