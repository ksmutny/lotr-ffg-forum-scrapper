Just no clear ruling here.\n\nPoints for \"shadow card is also an encounter card\":\n\n * Rules p. 3: The game component list in the upper left (with the dots) refers to quest cards, hero cards, player cards and encounter cards. Like an attachment card is also a player card, a shadow card is an encounter card.\n * Shadow cards come from the encounter deck, therefor they are encounter cards, too.\n * The intention of Eaves of Mirkwood is to be a place full of unexpected evil, from which there is no escape. Its intention is that neither when revealed effects, nor shadow effects can be canceled.\n\nPoints for \"shadow cards are no encounter cards\":\n\n * Rules p. 6, upper left: encounter deck consists of enemy, location and treachery cards. No shadow cards are mentioned.\n * Shadow cards are a means for establishing randomness in combat, and are a (much better) replacement for dice rolls or something. They are not inteded to be encounter cards.\n\nPasages not saying anything or indicating both at a time:\n\n * Rules p. 20, lower left: \"Whenever a card is discarded, it goes to the discard pile belonging to the card’s originating deck.\" If this would have been written as \"each card goes to the discard pile determined by the card type\", it would be clear that shadow cards are also encounter cards, too. But FFG uses \"originating deck\" which tells us nothing.\n * FAQ 1.2 p. 6, right column, in the middle: Q: \"What happens to Banks of the Anduin (CORE 113) if it is drawn as a Shadow card?\" A: \"... When a card is drawn as a Shadow card, only its Shadow text is considered to be active.\" So keywords, traits, escape values and non-shadow effects are blanked. What's with the title, what's with the card type? Can a card type be \"inactive\" at all?\n * Rules p. 23, lower right about shadow effects: \"Some of the cards in the encounter deck have a secondary effect ...\". The \"secondary effect\" indicates that a shadow card is an encounter card secondarly. The fact that FFG has not written \"Some of the encounter cards ...\" could indicate that shadow cards are no encounter cards.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I really love this game, and I regard it as much better, innovative, thematic and player friendly than all other card games I've been playing so far (MTG, SWCCG (from Decipher), MECCG, STCCG 1+2, X-Files CCG and perhaps some more). And I like the rules splitting idea (basics into rulebook for everyone, details in FAQ), too. But some things just need to be clarified more and put into the details section...\n\nHas anyone submitted a rules question yet?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58612-the-eaves-of-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=576344","commentId":576344,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1326010181,"content":"I did actually ask for a reference to a rule or official FAQ, But I don't think there is one so I will email Nate and see what he says..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58612-the-eaves-of-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=576345","commentId":576345,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1326010199,"content":"I did actually ask for a reference to a rule or official FAQ, But I don't think there is one so I will email Nate and see what he says..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58612-the-eaves-of-mirkwood/?do=findComment&comment=576366","commentId":576366,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326014538,"content":"Personally I play it that this location is only stopping cancels of cards from during the questing phase... but you can make perfectly solid arguments either way.. in fact, each alternative posting in this thread I will argue the opposite position form last time.. .\n\nRashley said:\n\nUntil I hear otherwise, I shall take it that we draw cards from the 'Encounter Deck'.  During 'Questing' we draw them as 'Encounter Cards', but during 'Combat' we draw them as 'Shadow Cards'.  There are 2 different types of card in the 'Encounter Deck' depending on what they were drawn for.
