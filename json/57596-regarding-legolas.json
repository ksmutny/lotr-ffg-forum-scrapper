I am pretty sure the answer is no as you are technically killing them with a card effect that uses the exhaust as a cost.. not form an \"attack he is part of.. I haven't got the cards in front of me right now.. but I am going to say that \"No it don't\" be interested to see what others think"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57596-regarding-legolas/?do=findComment&comment=567673","commentId":567673,"userName":"Puzzle2","timestamp":1323894656,"content":" For your first question, keep in mind that responses are optional. This means you can choose to use Legolas' ability or not.

This is a definite yes. Any time you have a location up, anything that would deal with progress tokens on your quest will, instead, deal with the location.\n\n \n\n2. Here I'm going to agree with the other two posters. It's just my personal opinion, but with almost 2 decades of card games under my belt I would say that NO, his effect does not trigger. This is because the \"harm\" going to the enemies is not from the exhausted characters, but rather from the card \"Rain of Arrows\".  This may seem counter-intuitive (Legolas is shooting the arrows!) but you need to think of this in terms of card mechanics and rules, not trying to place too much real-world logic into the scenario.  To SUMMARIZE: No, the card Rain of Arrows is causing the damage, not Legolas"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57596-regarding-legolas/?do=findComment&comment=567995","commentId":567995,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1323962003,"content":"I agree with the other responses.
