The possible outcomes of questing are all described for players (plural), so maybe it makes sense from a rules perspective for card effects to be worded the same:\n\n \n\n\"Finally, the players compare the combined willpower strength of all committed characters against the combined threat strength of all cards in the staging area... If the (threat strength) is higher, the players have unsuccessfully quested, and they are driven back by the encounter deck...\"\n\n \n\nWe know that the core rules apply even if the number of players is just one, and that the plural is meant to apply to any number (1-4) players.
