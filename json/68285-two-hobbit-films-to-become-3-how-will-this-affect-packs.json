Remember, there being two Hobbit boxes and there being two Hobbit movies didn't really have any connection, as we are getting both Hobbit boxes rather soon, while the second movie wasn't coming out for another year. Now we'll still be getting our two Hobbit boxes and the three movies won't have all hit theaters until December 2014.\n\nWhile I'm sure FFG wants to tap into the movie anticipation I doubt they'd break up these specific Hobbit boxes and make us wait two and a half years for all of them.\n\nWhat's more likely, that I'd expect, is that next year and the year after, we'll see some other new Hobbit related boxes or adventure pack cycles, either dealing more with the Hobbit appendices, or more Hobbit adventures they skipped over, etc. unrelated to these two incoming Hobbit boxes, however."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68285-two-hobbit-films-to-become-3-how-will-this-affect-packs/?do=findComment&comment=666053","commentId":666053,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1343661124,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n \n\ntimbolton said:\n\n \n\nI think there being three films will NOT affect FFG's release strategy at all.

I've just picked up the War of the Ring 2nd edition box set, not sure if FFG are handling US versions of this still, but it's with another company in the EU and UK now. And to add to all the great stuff above, another company has rights to making film-based card games, board games and not sure what else, all looking to be ccgs (with the rare card problem, ie overpriced and hard to get - and the reason why I buy FFG and won't buy the other upcoming card game). I hope the film based ccg/board games do not make it difficult for the companies who are basing their products on book-based only."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68285-two-hobbit-films-to-become-3-how-will-this-affect-packs/?do=findComment&comment=666391","commentId":666391,"userName":"John85","timestamp":1343723893,"content":"I hope that FFG doesn't take a hint from the third film. Jackson's work is entertaining, and succeeds on several levels in bringing the books to life, but too much is changed, added, or removed in the transition to film.
