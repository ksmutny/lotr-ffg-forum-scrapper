I'm looking for more FFG 'friends' who play this great game so that I have more people to compare stats to on the Quest Log. If anyone else is looking for more friends as well, send me a friend invite and I'll friend you.\n\nThe Quest Log seems like a really great idea. It's especially nice to be able to see the community stats. I'm hoping they add to it in the future as it'd be nice to see some other stats, like our community average score on each individual Quest. That'd be great fun to see which ones we collectively struggle with or dominate. It seems like that could be helpful for the game designers as well.\n\nRight now we can only see community average scores broken down by player count, which is still useful though.\n\nThe current community averages for all combined Quests by player count are:\n\nSolo Play: 31.44\n\n2 Player: 76.19\n\n3 Player: 111.26\n\n4 Player: 126.37\n\nDoes everyone think those are good averages to aim for and improve upon while playing? I currently only have 2 FFG friends who play this, so I can only see a few entries, but judging (poorly) by that I'm thinking not many people have played or entered a lot of games yet and so the averages are based on our early 'learning' games, possibly many with just the pre-made decks. So maybe these numbers can be improved upon.\n\nOther thoughts on the Quest Log? Do people like it & more importantly plan to use it? Are the numbers bad? Etc?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50174-thoughts-on-the-quest-log-looking-for-friends/?do=findComment&comment=501768","commentId":501768,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1311087900,"content":"Mattr0polis said:\n\nDoes everyone think those are good averages to aim for and improve upon while playing?

But yeah, maybe people just don't use it or stopped using it.\n\nStill, it's a great resource imo. I hope more people start to use it.\n\nWeird that it doesn't show the failure games in with the results as well, so the stats like Hero Weight are only based on the win games.\n\nAn average win percentage would be neat eventually too.\n\nI think I have the same goal as you, try and win every scenario with every player count."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50174-thoughts-on-the-quest-log-looking-for-friends/?do=findComment&comment=501985","commentId":501985,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1311133896,"content":"I think it makes a lot of sense that fail statistics aren't included, as many players will no doubt log only a fraction of their failed attempts.
