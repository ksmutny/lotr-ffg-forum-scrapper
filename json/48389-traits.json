But Since Dunedain is a race, and Gondor is a place, I guess it separates the Gondorian Dunedain from the others. Unfortunately there really isn´t much of an Arnor to speak of at the time of this game, but maybe we´ll see historical figures? \n\nOther than that, woses really sound intriguing. Anyone care to guess how long before we see a Ghan-Buri-Ghan ally card?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48389-traits/?do=findComment&comment=485304","commentId":485304,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1308074977,"content":"Thanks for the response.\n\nThis is what the Encyclopedia of Arda has to say about Dúnedain.\n\n\"A term used in Middle-earth for the Men of Númenor and (especially) their descendants in Arnor and Gondor after the Dowfall in 3319 of the Second Age.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48389-traits/?do=findComment&comment=485452","commentId":485452,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1308103415,"content":" I think they are using Beorning to describe some of the people near Mirkwood."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48389-traits/?do=findComment&comment=485479","commentId":485479,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1308106567,"content":"Perhaps.
