If you use him, you don't end up dealing the damage so you haven't paid the cost. So, using him to prevent the damage cost of those effects also prevents those effects.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252128-honour-guard-and-seld-damaging-effects-like-erkenbrand-or-derndingle-warrior/?do=findComment&comment=2835480","commentId":2835480,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1497433563,"content":"You are both right.

So I'm almost sure that you can cancel the cost. But since there is not enough consistent rules (but ruling more or less official that we can read at some place) it is hard to be 100% sure on such question.\n\nEveryone seem agree to say that if you can cancel the cost it will cancel the benefit (the effect). Since you seem to haven't do anything I don't see any relevant situation where when need to now if it is possible ^^. But may be there is some time were it is useful (for example if you need to get our honour guard to be exhausted for a unknown reason)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252128-honour-guard-and-seld-damaging-effects-like-erkenbrand-or-derndingle-warrior/?do=findComment&comment=2841211","commentId":2841211,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1497759020,"content":"> On 6/15/2017 at 0:42 PM, Slothgodfather said:\n> \n> Are you sure?  I thought I remembered a post on here saying you can't cancel costs - I may be confusing games to, or I'm confusing it with the Quick Ears + Wingfoot combo.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252128-honour-guard-and-seld-damaging-effects-like-erkenbrand-or-derndingle-warrior/?do=findComment&comment=2844388","commentId":2844388,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1497974906,"content":"just going to write it off a fuzzy memories are fuzzy.  thanks guys!"}]}
