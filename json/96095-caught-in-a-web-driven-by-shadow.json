However, Driven by Shadow [shadow effect] does not require you to control the attachment [\"Choose and discard 1 attachment from the defending character\"] - so you can choose to discard Caught in a Web."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96095-caught-in-a-web-driven-by-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=943266","commentId":943266,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1388681818,"content":"If one attachment is out of your control you can't discard it because you can't manage it"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96095-caught-in-a-web-driven-by-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=943276","commentId":943276,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1388682110,"content":"jjeagle is right, the shadow text card on Driven by Shadow does not specify that you have to control the attachement.\n\n \n\nWe also had an official answer from Caleb to confirm this."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96095-caught-in-a-web-driven-by-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=945976","commentId":945976,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1388931280,"content":"Well thanks for answers :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
