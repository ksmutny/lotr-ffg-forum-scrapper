Since the resource icon indicates which sphere a hero belongs to, if a hero gains an additional resource icon from a card effect, then the hero will belong to that sphere as well. That will allow you to combo cards like Good Meal with the song cards.\n\nCheers,\n\nCaleb\"\n\n \n\nAnd that's in this thread here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/84466-sphere-match/?hl=%2Bgood+%2Bmeal]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102107-the-masters-malice-and-songs/?do=findComment&comment=1023562","commentId":1023562,"userName":"philkav","timestamp":1395600799,"content":"Thanks for the answer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102107-the-masters-malice-and-songs/?do=findComment&comment=1024024","commentId":1024024,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1395630149,"content":"Playing songs is a really good way to handle this treachery in a multisphere deck, although the allies will still take a beating."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102107-the-masters-malice-and-songs/?do=findComment&comment=1392274","commentId":1392274,"userName":"Laco","timestamp":1420405812,"content":"The Master´s Malice affects neutral allies too?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/102107-the-masters-malice-and-songs/?do=findComment&comment=1392468","commentId":1392468,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1420413158,"content":"neutral is a lack of sphere and not a sphere in itself... so, yes."}]}
