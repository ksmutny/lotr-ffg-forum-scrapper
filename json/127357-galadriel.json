I couldn't find much on it.\n\n \n\nI got Celebrimbor's Secret yesterday, put a whole lot of elf goodyness and some ents into my lore/spirit deck and tried it this afternoon.\n\n \n\nGaladriel is great, no doubt. I ran her with Elrond and spirit Glorfindel. I beat PtM with ease, though that's hardly an accomplishment for a seasoned player and I'll put the deck to the test with more difficult scenarios when I have the time. (Questing was so good and my threat so constant I never even had to engage the Beastmaster or Ufthak, but just quested over their heads.)\n\n \n\nGaladriel cannot quest, attack or defend, but am I right in assuming she can be assigned damage from undefended attacks?\n\n \n\nI'm thinking of pairing this deck with Celeborn/Elladan/Elrohir for maximum elven mayhem.\n\nEdited November 18, 2014 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127357-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=1338833","commentId":1338833,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1416333132,"content":"Nothing wrong with that... didn't read the card in a while, but don't remember anything that said she cannot."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127357-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=1339124","commentId":1339124,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1416346389,"content":"Well, does her card says anything about damage from undefended attacks?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127357-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=1341307","commentId":1341307,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1416518808,"content":"She's a beast.

If you trigger an effect that lasts until “the end of the phase” during Setup, it will last until the end of the first resource phase. \n\nGaladriel’s ability does apply to objective-allies that enter play during Setup (as long as they are not immune to player card effects).\nCheers,\nCaleb\"\n\n \n\nSo, while Galadriel is in play, objective allies under your control will not exhaust to quest during the first round.  And \"Setup\" is technically considered part of the first \"round\" for the purpose of resolving card effects."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127357-galadriel/?do=findComment&comment=1425247","commentId":1425247,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1422468072,"content":"****, totally not see this question.
