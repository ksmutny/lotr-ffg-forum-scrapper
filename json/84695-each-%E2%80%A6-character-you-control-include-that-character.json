So, by default, the Herdsman would have 2 hit points, not the 1 printed on the card?\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84695-each-%E2%80%A6-character-you-control-include-that-character/?do=findComment&comment=801481","commentId":801481,"userName":"nismojoe","timestamp":1370290261,"content":"correct!!!!!!!jkb3jrr32"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84695-each-%E2%80%A6-character-you-control-include-that-character/?do=findComment&comment=801724","commentId":801724,"userName":"MrMetlHed","timestamp":1370375233,"content":"Great, thanks!
