Now... I get it, just about... and am really enjoying adjusting the deck to suit the scenario. Thank you FFG for an amazing game!\n\n \n\nI've searched through this forum and BoardGameGeek for clear answers to these questions but not come across anything, so hoped you guys could help.\n\n \n\nTwo really simple questions..\n\n \n\n1. When you reveal a guarded card, you then reveal another encounter card to 'guard' it. That's simple enough. My question is, if you do not claim the card after dealing with it's guard, does the next encounter card that is revealed, perhaps the next round, 'reguard' the guard card, or does the guarded card remain unguarded until claimed?\n\n \n\n2. Can you or can you not legally use 'Surprise Attack' with 'Gandalf'... i.e. reuse Gandalf by putting him back into your hand as per 'Surprise Attack''s instructions?\n\n \n\nThanks for your help guys, really appreciate it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/125529-surprise-and-guard/?do=findComment&comment=1308879","commentId":1308879,"userName":"cawe00","timestamp":1414046745,"content":"I don't know about you first question.\n\nIf you mean sneak attack in your second question the answer is yes.
