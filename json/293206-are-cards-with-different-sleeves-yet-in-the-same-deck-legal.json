Sure, there may be corner cases with riddles and such where knowing a little about your top card helps… But planning how to spend your precious resources is a fundamental part of the game, and knowing the sphere you're going to get next changes that calculus markedly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/293206-are-cards-with-different-sleeves-yet-in-the-same-deck-legal/?do=findComment&comment=3665242","commentId":3665242,"userName":"Paladin Ignatius","timestamp":1554157315,"content":"Okay, so far I'm hearing a lot of good reasons for not sleeving my decks in their respective colors.  In particular, this comment made a lot of sense:\n\n> 2 hours ago, icabod said:\n> \n> You're not supposed to know what's coming next unless you use a card effect to look at the deck, but even with just different coloured sleeves you would know that the next card is a Tactics card, so you can plan your resources in advance.\n> \n> It would also affect shuffling.  When you shuffle the deck you're supposed to randomise the card draw, but you could easily shuffle so that \"Oh, surprise, I've managed to put most of the Tactics cards near the top, and I just happen to have a load of Tactics resources\".\n\nI hadn't thought about the fact that it does affect how you play the game if you know what's coming.  It would actually spoil the surprise.  Nice catch."}]}
