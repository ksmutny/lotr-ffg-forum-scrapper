Gléowine, Warden of healing.\n\n \n\nCan easily get +3 willpower for each Gondor ally, so it doesn't matter so much if half of them are tactics and start with zero. Tactigorn gives -1 defense to enemies, +1 attack from Boromir, For gondor for when you realy need to go to town on the attack/def ot have battle/siege quests.\n\n \n\nBest start we had the Tac/Lead deck played 11 cards on the first turn :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nPlease excuse spelling and punctuation.\n\nEdited October 8, 2016 by NZEngineer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/231844-strongest-deck-archetypes/?do=findComment&comment=2451368","commentId":2451368,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1476164408,"content":"Should be ask in what format?
