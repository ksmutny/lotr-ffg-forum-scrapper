It should not be possible for players to damage Bellach before advancing to stage 2B. It may be necessary to errata stage 2A to add “Bellach cannot take damage during this attack.”\nHope you’re enjoying Celebrimbor’s Secret!\nCheers,\nCaleb\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n \n\nSo there we have it. One of the suspected answers and I think this is the first time I sent a rules query, that seems to make it to the errata.\n\nYay me! :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nOh noes, for more erratas to remember!\n\nWould be nice with a pack (will gladly pay the $$$ for it) containing all the errataed cards for those of us who got the game from day one and have much to remember"}]}
