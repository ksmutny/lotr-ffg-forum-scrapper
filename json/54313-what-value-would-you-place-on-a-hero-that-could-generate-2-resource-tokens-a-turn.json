If we had as many resource generating cards as we do draw cards, Sauron and his minions would be running back to Mordor, never to come out again. \n\nAs for a hero that could generate two resources a turn, I think his threat should be the highest in the game yet. Think about it, you cannot evaluate him on what he can do alone, you must also consider what kind of synergies he would create and what advantages that would generate. \n\nConsidering that we already have multiple ways of adding card draws and a powerful resource generating attachment like Steward of Gondor, what do you think such a hero is worth, even with low stats? You could very quickly be playing multiple allies or attachments which would take the load off of him and then he would go right on generating resources. I think a hero like this could represent a significant level of power creep in the game because of all he could be surrounded with and may have to be treated accordingly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54313-what-value-would-you-place-on-a-hero-that-could-generate-2-resource-tokens-a-turn/?do=findComment&comment=538549","commentId":538549,"userName":"ppsantos","timestamp":1317994035,"content":"The cost will probably have to be somewhere between a hero (produces 1 resource) and a hero with Steward of Gondor attachment (produces 3 resources).  But a hero producing 2 resources might be too powerful. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54313-what-value-would-you-place-on-a-hero-that-could-generate-2-resource-tokens-a-turn/?do=findComment&comment=538869","commentId":538869,"userName":"rfh0","timestamp":1318065445,"content":"Instead of making a Hero produce 2 resource tokens by itself, why not make an attachement such as \"The Ring\" that would produce and extra resource every turn to the hero that has it, but also adds 2 threat each turn.\n\nOr you could have Allies such as \"Sam\" that when it play they add a resource to a hero or create resource themself since they are such an add to the party. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54313-what-value-would-you-place-on-a-hero-that-could-generate-2-resource-tokens-a-turn/?do=findComment&comment=538960","commentId":538960,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1318076751,"content":"rfh0 said:\n\nInstead of making a Hero produce 2 resource tokens by itself, why not make an attachement such as \"The Ring\" that would produce and extra resource every turn to the hero that has it, but also adds 2 threat each turn.\n\nOr you could have Allies such as \"Sam\" that when it play they add a resource to a hero or create resource themself since they are such an add to the party. gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\n\n\nOr maybe a hero that allows you to produce extra resources at the cost of 1 threat per resource token...
