CardGameDB is going to be slowly absorbed and intergrated directy into FFG. This is such a good decision. Card popup links, searchable card databas base, decks etc etc. All the things that a card game community should have.\n\n \n\nMost important though it will consolidate the community together.\n\n \n\nGreat news CardGameDB is the best place for LCGs and FFG are really making the right choice here."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88634-cardgamedb-bought-by-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=842297","commentId":842297,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1376689480,"content":"Call me old-fashion, but I still prefer to spend the extra time to make my decks with all the physical cards.  It's half the fun of the game for me, actually.  CardGameDB is still great for referencing cards real quick like, though.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88634-cardgamedb-bought-by-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=842305","commentId":842305,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1376689662,"content":"Yeah, it is a very good reference site.

Still the majority of decks posted online at ANY location.. including here is exported form cardgameDB and while the LoTR community is mainly here, most of the other games are not. I think the major changes this will bring to this game will be the ability to share and post decks directly through the site as well as have card images and popup links directly inside the posts."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88634-cardgamedb-bought-by-ffg/?do=findComment&comment=842330","commentId":842330,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1376691366,"content":"> Are you serious?
