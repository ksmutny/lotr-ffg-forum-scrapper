I can see no mention of a \"different\" setup for either the solo or the 4 player game so do the card mechanics scale the game to the number of players or am I missing something.\n\n \n\nLooks like a great game and these Forums are REALLY helpful.\n\n \n\nCheers Guys N Gals"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46185-solo-and-4-player-game-setup/?do=findComment&comment=462836","commentId":462836,"userName":"Apophenia","timestamp":1304424368,"content":"weebaldy said:\n\n \n\n1-\n\nI can see that to play a four player game you would need two core sets to get 4 trackers and more tokens but as there are 12 heroes and 4 player decks in one core set why, apart from these bits do we need two sets to play ?. \n\n \n\n2-\n\nRelated to the above really.

You need two copies to create 4 tournament legal decks which need to have 50 cards. The decks still need to be dual-sphere but you can do it with two core sets.\n\n2. Certain scenarios, like scenario 2, have setup instructions that are based off the number of players. Also during staging you draw one card per player. Adding more players does make the game a easier though so the first scenario might be too easy if you are playing with three or four players. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46185-solo-and-4-player-game-setup/?do=findComment&comment=462849","commentId":462849,"userName":"Fieras","timestamp":1304425593,"content":"When we first picked up the game, we did a 3 player game with the core set.  I just tracked my threat on paper.\n\nHowever, the previous poster was correct.  You cannot make four 50 card decks with one core set.  We were content playing with the starter single sphere decks when we first got the game though."}]}
