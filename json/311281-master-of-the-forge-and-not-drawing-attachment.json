Page 2 of the online rules reference...\n\n\"The initiation of any keyword which uses the word “may” in its keyword description is optional. The application of all other keywords is mandatory.\"\n\nSo for your example you'd need to incorporate some discard effects then reshuffle your discard pile into your deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311281-master-of-the-forge-and-not-drawing-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=3989198","commentId":3989198,"userName":"steve83","timestamp":1600279818,"content":"Thanks.

That's interesting, and seems plausible, unless I'm not understanding some of the legalese.\n\nThose two sections of the RR taken together seem to say that choosing a card during any kind of search is by default optional (unless it is specified otherwise on the card, as per Golden Rule)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311281-master-of-the-forge-and-not-drawing-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=3990648","commentId":3990648,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1600515042,"content":"Every time the encounter deck tells me to search for a Hill Troll I will choose not to find it then :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311281-master-of-the-forge-and-not-drawing-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=3990699","commentId":3990699,"userName":"steve83","timestamp":1600531750,"content":"I just looked again at the quest card that tells you to search for the Hill Troll, and it definitely doesn't explicitly say you \"must\" add it to the staging area (though obviously you must).\n\nSo, that suggests that the first rule quoted above applies to the text on the card, and the text on the card overrides the second rule quoted above, making the \"may\" in that redundant.\n\n(And hence, when using MotF card selection is mandatory if possible.)\n\nEdited September 19 by steve83"}]}
