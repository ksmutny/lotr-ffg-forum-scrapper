Another interesting option could be a card that lets you delay the effect of a treachery for a phase or two. This may seem useless, but it could have some interesting applications. For example, a treachery card that fetches enemies could be pushed back until after the quest phase, so that at least their threat is not factored into quest resolution."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113915-options-outside-eleanor/?do=findComment&comment=1212269","commentId":1212269,"userName":"entMoot","timestamp":1408464168,"content":"It may not be cancellation, but Lore already has cards like Risk Some Light and Out of the Wild that help you avoid the worst upcoming encounter card (albeit not specifically a Treachery) in a proactive manner.

Enemies can be damaged or kept from attacking, treacheries can have their threat negated or some progress put on, but with treacheries it's kind of all or nothing. Test of Will is actually amazing, because it can negate one player turn's worth of encounter cards for one card and one resource.\n\nEleanor is obviously slightly different in that the treachery is replaced with a new encounter card, so that's a mechanic that might happen again, e.g. as an event or attachment.\n\nI really like the discard an ally to cancel option though.

Glad you like them. Alternatively we could have a card like Dunedain Watcher: a 3 (or even 4) cost leadership ally with basic stats, something like 1 each and 2 HP that could be discarded from play to cancel or replace a treachery card, provided he was commited to the quest.\n\nFor a tactics equivelant I think a 1 cost event card that replaces the treachery card with the encounter deck's topmost enemy would be ideal. The treachery would then be reshuffled in the deck. This way, the tactics player would force the deck to give him a challenge more appropriate for his combat playstyle.\n\nOf course, with the slow rate new cards come out, I doubt we'll be seeing such new cards any time soon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113915-options-outside-eleanor/?do=findComment&comment=1215722","commentId":1215722,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1408584783,"content":"A couple new ideas popped into my head. This first one is similar to Minas Tirith Lampwright. It's Lore, where you have the greatest amount of scrying so you could potentially always \"guess\" correctly.\n\n \n\n1 cost, Lore, Ally\n\n1W, 0A, 0D, 1H\n\n \n\nResponse: After an treachery card is revealed, discard [THIS ALLY] to name enemy, location, or treachery. Look at the top card of the encounter deck. If that card is the named type, cancel the treachery card.\n\n \n\nHere's an interesting event that could work for Tactics:\n\n0 cost, Tactics, Event\n\n \n\nResponse: After a card with a 'when revealed' effect is revealed, discard a character with 2 or more defense to cancel that effect.\n\n \n\nI also think that Tactics should have a reliable means of dealing with shadow cards. Maybe we could have means of just dealing with certain annoying types of shadow cards. Like have an attachment that says that enemies can only attack one time per round. This would prevent the \"extra attack\" shadows, but it would also with other effects that give enemies additional attacks. That would kinda negate Durin's Bane, so maybe have it say that enemies cannot attack YOU more than once per round. Or maybe we could target the +attack shadows with something like \"While attached character is defending, cancel any shadow effects that give the attacking enemy + attack.\"\n\n \n\nWe could also limit the scope like this: \"After the attached character is declared as a defender, discard a shadow card dealt to an enemy engaged with another player.\" This would work wonderfully to either allow you to sentinel defend or give another player without Tactics to be able to defend more confidently. The interesting nuance is that if you're the last player to defend and you didn't defend with sentinel, then the ability is useless. It's also useless solo, but in certain multiplayer configurations, this can be a very powerful card. The ability could even be on a sentinel hero itself (of course it would have to be reworded to refer specifically to the hero instead of \"attached character\").\n\nEdited August 21, 2014 by joezim007"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113915-options-outside-eleanor/?do=findComment&comment=1215751","commentId":1215751,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1408585887,"content":"I am actually against giving tactics tools versus shadow effects because tactics can already deal with them with pure brute force.

If another player is willing to let you discard one of their allies so that we can prevent a treachery, I don't see why not. It just gives it less limitation, but it's still the same cost either way.\n\n \n\nThere are plenty of allies in Tactics with 2+ defense. Just a quick count using CardGameDB's deckbuilder:\n\nTactics: 7\n\nSpirit: 5\n\nLeadership: 4\n\nLore: 2\n\nNeutral: 4\n\n \n\nMost of the allies with sentinel have 2 defense or more. The couple exceptions are Gondorian Spearman and Landroval. Also Arwen can give anyone sentinel. So adding \"or sentinel\" into there wouldn't give a whole lot more flexibility. Arwen, however could open up a lot of possibilities because she can give +1 AND sentinel, so either way she can open up a whole lot more target options."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/113915-options-outside-eleanor/?do=findComment&comment=1218227","commentId":1218227,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1408676495,"content":"Yeah fair reasoning.
