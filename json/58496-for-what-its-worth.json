The first was a slow Passage of Mirkwood game during which i paused several times (took me 3 days) to ask questions on this forum. I completed that at 147pts. Lost one Hero. The second attempt, I armed myself with the knowledge I had gained from the help on this forum and completed the Passage of Mirkwood in 5 rounds. On the first two Quest Attempts, I drew the Forest Spider. I had all three in play at once. After getting thru them it was smooth sailing. I didn't pull anything but locations for the next 3 rounds and managed to throw all of my hero's and ally's into questing (paid to ready Aragorn each turn).\n\nI drew the Ungoliant Spawn variant of stage 3, played Gandalf to deal 4 damage and then ganged up on him to do the rest of the 5 points.\n\nTotal score...86!\n\nLike i said, for what its worth. I could still be a little off on my game playing but I pretty sure i stuck to the book.\n\nThe thing I love about this game is that, so far, 2 games, totally different. I want to try the quest with the other 3 core set sphere of influence decks to see how it all changes.\n\nFun!\n\nÂ "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58496-for-what-its-worth/?do=findComment&comment=575415","commentId":575415,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1325810729,"content":"86 wow... nice score!! Is that using the updated score system or the one in the manual?\n\nI juist posted on teh forum a solo mirkwood game using a single copy of core... was really fun. This quest can be trickey unless you build your dec kcorrectly as there is a nu,ber of when revealed effects on both treachery and enemies that can throw a mega spanner in the works.. it is a very hard quest to predict."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58496-for-what-its-worth/?do=findComment&comment=575488","commentId":575488,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1325831972,"content":"great stuff, pleased you're enjoying it....now for anduin???\n\ni actually find a couple of the adventure packs much easier than mirkwood...so take heart from this, emyn muil and dead marshes with the right deck especially"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58496-for-what-its-worth/?do=findComment&comment=575776","commentId":575776,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1325872986,"content":"Yes, that was using the new scoring system. 5 Rounds = 50pts...i had all my hero's and only 3 damage points. My threat level was a 33.\n\nAfter the first three spiders, i drew nothing but location cards. The one time I had to draw an encounter card because of a Force rule, I drew Necromancer's Reach but had not exhausted player (lucky!).\n\nI played with a couple allies and quested everyone to boost the willpower. All that together made for a fast game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58496-for-what-its-worth/?do=findComment&comment=575859","commentId":575859,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1325900825,"content":"neat... a present walk in the forest then.. for some reason my compass goes all ****** and I end up lost in the middle of no where with ork chieftains and giant spiders hunting me down..
