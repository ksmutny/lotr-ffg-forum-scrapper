As spoiled, there will be 2 Hobbit Heroes coming in the first two expansions. Plus, it has been hinted that Boromir (likely) as a Gondor Hero is coming in the fifth. I guess and hope there will be at least one more Elven (likely Silvan) Hero in the expansion 3 or 4. The remaining spot may probably be kept for another Dúnedain perhaps.\n\nWhat do you think? Moreso, not just traits but names. We've just seen Éomund as an Ally and I bet for Éomer as a Hero. But how about an Elf? Thranduil, just to have another family bond covered? Or something more Noldor like Elrond? I think I read long ago that Elrond is going to be a Hero although thematically he seems more fit as an Ally. That doesn't mean much though as we've seen Denethor a Hero already."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491724","commentId":491724,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1309183461,"content":"Beravor, Thalin, and Eleanor are also heroes from Middle-earth Quest.  I wouldn't be surprised if the other two heroes from that game are released as heroes.  Argalad is an Elf, probably Silvan like Legolas, and Eometh is one of the Rohirim."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491726","commentId":491726,"userName":"Maggical","timestamp":1309183513,"content":"Haldir will be great!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491727","commentId":491727,"userName":"Kiwina","timestamp":1309183669,"content":" Haldir is an ally being released in the A Journey to Rhosgobel adventure pack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49130-guessing-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=491732","commentId":491732,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1309185285,"content":"So Bilbo and Frodo coming in next 2 Packs.

More Dunedain at some point would seem like a good thing to have, but for now, Elves look like the way forward- and so many to choose: Thranduil, Celeborn, Galadriel (I expect not, probably an Ally, Gandalf-style) Elrond, Elladan, Elrohir are the first few that leap to mind.\n\nMiddle Earth Quest players - are there other heroes from there who we've not seen yet?

I hope the tally of other nations/races will get to that number or so. The biggest problem may be Hobbits but perhaps the designers hall take legacy to include the likes of Peregrin Took or they will make up their own. As for making up characters, I am not against it, and it has been very fortunate with the likes of Henamarth Riversong; however, where there is plenty I do not think we need more, thus I'd much rather see Thranduil, Celeborn, Elladan, Elrohir, etc. than a made-up elf. Same goes for Rohan, there quite a few names to choose from. Dunedain could gain Halbarad.
