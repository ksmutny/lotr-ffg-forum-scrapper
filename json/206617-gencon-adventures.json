The above picture is an image of the FFG POD LotR:LCG store section. You may also want to browse on-line retailers such as CoolStuffinc, Miniature Market or Amazon as they usually sell the GenCon quests at a better price. It typically takes 3-6 months after GenCon for these quests to be released to the general public.\n\n \n\nFFG has also hosted a Fellowship Event in October/November the past two years for which they produce a special quest. This Fellowship Quest (Fog on the Barrow Downs in 2014 and Murder at the Prancing Pony in 2015) is also eventually released via POD.\n\n \n\nKeep in mind that FFG usually provides some extra swag (alt-art cards, play-mats) to the attendees of the GenCon quest and the Fellowship quests. These products can only be obtained at the event itself (or via E-bay, etc) and are not available when the quests go up on POD.\n\nEdited March 25, 2016 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/206617-gencon-adventures/?do=findComment&comment=2122375","commentId":2122375,"userName":"WillisRBC","timestamp":1458830245,"content":"Ok cool.
