It costs 4 which can be a lot but having an extra hero that gathers resources can be huge in decks with low resource generation, and it is also a great way to smooth your resources (though then again, Resourceful can do pretty much the same thing without having to have a unique ally). In the Elrond Gandalf deck or any Elrond deck it can be extremely useful due to all the unique allies that deck uses and it's capability of playing expensive cards for free. In a hobbit deck as well it can be really good, since you'll probably use stuff like Elf-stone and Timely Aid to get big allies such as Beorn or Gildor into play. Having suddenly a Beorn or Gildor hero in a hobbit deck can be huge. Really really interesting and all around good card.\n\n \n\nOther than that, I'm excited for that unique leadership weapon!

The encounter art, especially on possession and dwimmerlaik (awesome name too!!!), is just amazing and the few player cards we've seen are great. Sword-thain is super interesting and opens up many new combos or strategies. I for one am looking forward to putting it on ally Legolas allowing you to put more than just a Rivendell Blade on him weapon wise and turning him into an epic slayer drawing you many cards whilst slaying! There are definitely better or more complex uses for it however such as Beorn ally listed above. Tale of Tinuviel sounds epic and for anyone using decks that feature a mix of Noldor and Dunedain heroes or allies could be a really great card! That tactics Dunedain ally looks great and in multiplayer if the most combat dedicated player is using them they could have as high as 3 or 4 attack quite regularly. Having Ranged, the Ranger trait and 3 hitpoints are all very nice as well. Heir of Valandil could see you playing this ally for free or at least just 1 if you are engaged with 3 or 3 enemies respectively. Weather Stained Cloak looks like it could be really great even at 0 cost. It is limit 1 per character and must be attached to a ranger character. Maybe it can be discarded to cancel a shadow effect just revealed? Perhaps it stops the attached character from taking damage from encounter card effects? Similar to Star Broach but stops nasty treacheries that do direct damages to all questing, exhausted or whatever characters. I'm really curious to see what this card and the Tale of Tinuviel card do!\nThe quest sounds really great and the reanimated mechanic is very clever. Sounds like it will be pretty **** hard though.

Card text always trumpts rulebook. So, unfortunately, I think Beorn ally-hero will actually go back into the player deck.\n\n \n\nI think you're right and it will end up being that Sword-Thain heroes can go into your hand/deck as per usual.  I keep thinking about it though, and then I think of Will of the West.  If it was as simple as the golden rule, Will of the West would move a discarded hero into your deck.  And you could use cards like Dwarven Tomb or Ered Nimrais Prospector to move a discarded hero into your hand or deck (dunno why you would want to do this).  Will of the West is the real problem, because you move the entire discard pile. I do not think it is supposed to move a hero.... because they ignore effects that move heroes to hands/decks.\n\n \n\nIf we observe that, then Sword-Thain also can't move heroes to hand/deck.  But neither could Lost and Alone, and we know that one can, so..... it's a circle.  Either I'm missing something, or we have no way to explain why Will of the West wouldn't move heroes to your deck, while Lost and Alone can.\n\nEdited July 12, 2015 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/182270-the-dread-realm/?do=findComment&comment=1689848","commentId":1689848,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1436710747,"content":">  \n> \n> >  \n> > \n> > And remember that golden rule?

One card that works very well in these Dúnedain decks is Tighten Our Belts. You cannot play much on round 1 anyway, so you save the resources and then every hero has three in the beginning of round 2.
