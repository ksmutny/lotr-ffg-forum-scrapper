So you're basically asking if Tolkien Estate gonna revoke FFG's rights to create in LotR universe? Well, why don't you call Tolkien estate then and ask them?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265081-is-this-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=3118680","commentId":3118680,"userName":"Yepesnopes","timestamp":1512916788,"content":"Not true.

The Card game already as an extreme amount of expansions. Enough to be played for a life time even. I wonder where people get the time to play all these adventures... i have rougly about 50% of all packs ever published and I have still years ahead of me to play them all. Not even talking about extreme replayability.\n\n2. There is absolutely no reason for a version 2 here. The LotR system was an extremely new card system and so I think the only possible way to go was digital.\n\n3. The fact it is NOT competitive makes it quite unique in the digital competition too. It avoids the draining of money like Magic or Hearthstone while retaining that unique LotR LCG solo/coop play.\n\nThat being said: it ALL depends on the final,programming quality. As such we should wait and see. All too often the transition to digital is not exactly a huge success. There are far more failures than successes in this software industry.\n\nThe good thing is that the original LotR design has a rock solid play mechanic, so we only can hope that the programming staff is up to some Blizzard style polished product."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265081-is-this-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=3122258","commentId":3122258,"userName":"urloony","timestamp":1513096317,"content":"> On 12/11/2017 at 4:54 AM, MMOfan said:\n> \n> The digital version will reinforce the paper version and vice versa.

They just released the digital game.  Contrary to what most are thinking, I see this as a possible benefit, albeit one that I will never play, but one that others may enjoy and may even bring them in to the physical card game.  This is also why we should be glad that it is NOT exactly the same game.\n\n2. We are one of the largest LCG player communities that FFG has.  Certainly, we have significantly more posts than any of their other LCGs.\n\n3.  They have never been limited to the characters or plot from the books.  So what if the saga has ended, still much more to tell.\n\n4. Amazon LOTR.  While likely completely unrelated, public interest in LOTR will stay high and in people's mind which may help to boost sales and keep it going.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265081-is-this-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=3122555","commentId":3122555,"userName":"JJ48","timestamp":1513104783,"content":"The app will also appeal to many people who may not be familiar with the physical game.  Some of those people will be content to just play the app, but others may be interested in trying out the physical card game, especially since the two are similar but not the same!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/265081-is-this-the-end-of-lotr-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=3122612","commentId":3122612,"userName":"shoreless","timestamp":1513106289,"content":"Time to pack it up, lads.
