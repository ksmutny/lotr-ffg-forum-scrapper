It reads \"The current quest card gains siege (and loses battle)\"  However the current quest card does not have \"battle\", 1B is a normal questing stage. Stage 2 does have battle. Are the parenthesis assuming someone leaves The Cross Roads in staging until you get to 2A/B?  \n\nFor Stage 1B I treat it as siege until I explore The Cross-Roads correct?\n\nOh, follow up question on same quest. Stage 1B says \"At the beginning of the quest phase, each player takes 1 hidden card\". Do I do this before activating an action such as Denethor's ability to look at the top card? Or can I activate Denethor before and then I know if my hidden card is an enemy or not?\n\nThanks!\n\nEdited April 16, 2018 by mewmartigan"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273657-blood-of-gondor-the-cross-roads/?do=findComment&comment=3286316","commentId":3286316,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1523841519,"content":"Okay, just finished the scenario and I probably answered my own question. The encounter deck is small enough it was recycled so The Cross-Roads did come back up during stage 2B. This was actually a great help as my siege questing ability was in much better shape than my battle questing. I kept it in the staging area for the remainder of the game.\n\nAnd when I played, I dealt the hidden card first, then activated Denethor.  I guess I could use the action window in the planning phase to use Denethor and look at what will become the hidden card instead..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273657-blood-of-gondor-the-cross-roads/?do=findComment&comment=3286320","commentId":3286320,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1523842423,"content":"> 13 minutes ago, mewmartigan said:\n> \n> And when I played, I dealt the hidden card first, then activated Denethor.  I guess I could use the action window in the planning phase to use Denethor and look at what will become the hidden card instead...\n\nExactly right. There is no window at the start of the quest phase, but you can use Denethor in the planning"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273657-blood-of-gondor-the-cross-roads/?do=findComment&comment=3286445","commentId":3286445,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1523862717,"content":"> 5 hours ago, Onidsen said:\n> \n> Exactly right.
