Take Nori as one of your heroes and filling your hand with dwarf allies should also prevent the Balrog from attacking. Additionally this also powers up the Erebor Battle Master. Feint is also an obvious choice if you go for the first approach.\n\nIf you're up for the second strategy and you don't want to play with dwarfs, Elrond is quite a big help. Put LoV and Vilya on him, and he can recruit a lot of extra allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80242-how-to-beat-shadow-and-flame-quest/?do=findComment&comment=771869","commentId":771869,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1362832930,"content":"Here you can see how to do it with a Dwarfs :\n\n\n\n"}]}
