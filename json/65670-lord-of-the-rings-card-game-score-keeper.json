You would also be able to add notes like what hero's you used. I was also thinking of making a tactics trainer with it. does anyone think i should continue with this project? \n\nThanks!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65670-lord-of-the-rings-card-game-score-keeper/?do=findComment&comment=641775","commentId":641775,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1339110321,"content":"You might wana contact the guys at CardGameDB as JuiceBox and the owner of that site are working on a new online version of the score keeper that also produces a ladder and other features.

It's not perfect but I've logged every LotR LCG game I've ever played in there and it's proved very useful in many ways to our group.\n\nLink:\n\njavascript:void(0);/*1339132875435*/ [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_lotr_gr_main.asp?eidgr=1]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65670-lord-of-the-rings-card-game-score-keeper/?do=findComment&comment=641805","commentId":641805,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1339119965,"content":"As I've said before, the only thing missing from the FFG Quest Log is a tally of our win/loss ratio. Right now you have the ability to enter losses but there's no real reason to as the statistics don't take them into account. I keep my own log on a google docs spread sheet to show my win/loss ratio for each scenario, broken down by number of players. It's also helpful in seeing how realistic FFG's dificulty rating is for each scenario."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65670-lord-of-the-rings-card-game-score-keeper/?do=findComment&comment=641806","commentId":641806,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1339120989,"content":"The FFG one is woefully inadequate.. you can not record decks in it, you can not record what heroes or partners used in muliplayer, there is no ladder system, no easy way to look up quest with out being friends and even if you are the process is extremely hard to use.. it failes in almost every aspect fo a database front end for this game… witch is why cardgameDB is working on something and the community desperately needs at best an online system or at least a local application like this guy is talking about."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65670-lord-of-the-rings-card-game-score-keeper/?do=findComment&comment=641960","commentId":641960,"userName":"dcyllo","timestamp":1339152831,"content":"I didn't even notice the quest log! haha well i might just go on with it for learning value since i need something to work on at the moment."}]}
