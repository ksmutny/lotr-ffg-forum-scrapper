If I use that action, but Beorn defends an attack and dies? The ability \"resets\" so it will be discarded normally, or when the round ends the ability will shuffle him back?\n\n \n\nThe way I see, the game does not have a \"memory\", so if a card is discarded, it doesn't \"remember\" anything from past abilities -thus Beorn stays on discard. But I want to check with the sages first :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited January 15, 2015 by Arkano"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132031-beorn-ally-from-core-set-action-and-death/?do=findComment&comment=1407913","commentId":1407913,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1421348666,"content":"Yeah, if he dies from the attack he doesn't get reshuffled back in."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132031-beorn-ally-from-core-set-action-and-death/?do=findComment&comment=1408062","commentId":1408062,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1421354697,"content":"yah like jimby said.  in fact, even if he were not destroyed, he could not use his ability that round since he exhausted to defend."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132031-beorn-ally-from-core-set-action-and-death/?do=findComment&comment=1408293","commentId":1408293,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1421364669,"content":"Well, if he defended and get as low as 1 hp, you can reshufle him back in your deck and play him back when you'll draw him."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132031-beorn-ally-from-core-set-action-and-death/?do=findComment&comment=1408854","commentId":1408854,"userName":"krokodiler","timestamp":1421408166,"content":"Beorn's text says: \"At the end of the phase in which you trigger this effect, shuffle Beorn back into your deck\".
