Luckily I am up to date w/ Arkham but we have been waiting almost a year for critical Armada expansions. Keyforge hooked a good number of local Magic players who refused to touch anything yet their interest is about to wane w/ lack of product. Destiny was DOA b/c the boosters were so far behind. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/290805-tifu-by-waiting-for-shadow-and-flame-to-be-in-stock/?do=findComment&comment=3623481","commentId":3623481,"userName":"Vince79","timestamp":1550087929,"content":"> 2 hours ago, codytx2 said:\n> \n> I am trying to get the Angmar Awakened cycle.
