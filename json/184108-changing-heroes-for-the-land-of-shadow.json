I like playing strong all purpose heroes that can quest, attack or defend in a pinch if need be and Elves seem to fill that role pretty **** well (plus they are my favourite race in middle earth). Sam is a bit of an exception as he has phenomenal willpower and if you keep threat low/engage lots of enemies optionally (that have higher engagement than your threat) he can be a pretty good attacker or even defender as well. Chuck a shield and dagger on him as well as a fast hitch and hes pretty **** flexible! Also in campaign/saga quests both Sting and Anduril go amazingly on him (has the noble trait due to Noble Hero being chosen and attached to Sam) and can put him up to 5 willpower, 3 attack (that can still get boosted from his ability) and 3 defense (can also still get boosted). Attach some fast hitches to mega buffed Sam and watch him cleave through foes whilst also questing for 5 or more! \n\nAlso he pairs really well with Elladan and Elrohir. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184108-changing-heroes-for-the-land-of-shadow/?do=findComment&comment=1720671","commentId":1720671,"userName":"Ecthelion III","timestamp":1438741901,"content":"I fully agree with PsychoRocka.
