This lists a great number of terms and abbreviations that can be useful for new players to understand our lingo. https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/07/14/lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/ [https://visionofthepalantir.com/2018/07/14/lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/]\n\nIf you have any additions to the list, feel free to let me know and I will update the list accordingly. Hope this helps a lot of new players and can put a smile on the face of more experienced players.\n\nAs for the rest of the blog, I am still working my way through the Ringmaker cycle, but with added support from co-authors, I am steadily pumping out more content like this. You can find ways to support us via the blog."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279227-lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/?do=findComment&comment=3404831","commentId":3404831,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1531585002,"content":"I like that you refer to Caldara's errata as a \"patch.\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279227-lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/?do=findComment&comment=3404892","commentId":3404892,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1531591043,"content":"I think \"nerf\" would be a better word than \"patch\", but I'm not a big errata fan."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279227-lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/?do=findComment&comment=3404913","commentId":3404913,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1531593474,"content":"Haha, good read"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279227-lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/?do=findComment&comment=3404914","commentId":3404914,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1531593562,"content":"Noticed you had some cotr references\n\n Spideresque: having qualities similar to spiders.  Only applies when talking about spider enemies\n\nEdited July 14, 2018 by player1683311"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279227-lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/?do=findComment&comment=3405016","commentId":3405016,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1531604086,"content":"“Only applies when talking about spider enemies.”\n\nAnd Brandon, lol! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279227-lotr-lcg-urban-dictionary/?do=findComment&comment=3405391","commentId":3405391,"userName":"Durins_Father","timestamp":1531652015,"content":"Thanks for the feedback guys, I have updated the list to include your suggestions."}]}
