At least for solo play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52774-one-sphere-decks/?do=findComment&comment=527145","commentId":527145,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1315834596,"content":"So far there is little incentive to play mono decks. Currently there's only one card that requires a mono deck (Thicket of Spears). Over time, more cards may be released that make playing mono-sphere decks more attractive.\n\nAnyway, when playing with 3-4 players, mono decks work well enough."}]}
