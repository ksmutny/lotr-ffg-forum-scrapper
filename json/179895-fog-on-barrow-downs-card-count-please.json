I personally have beaten only a few games in which I had to escape a second Great Barrow and the couple of times I've had a third appear I end up threating out or conceding (any locations revealed whilst in a great barrow increases threat and if you run decks that rely on each other and share duties between them having them split apart will quickly lead to a loss). \n\nNot including the 4 extra copies makes this quest a cake walk compared to what it is supposed to be.\n\nYou are meant to be dreading wights and barrows by the end and praying against another great barrow appearing before you make it to the finishing line. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/179895-fog-on-barrow-downs-card-count-please/?do=findComment&comment=1656131","commentId":1656131,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1434010374,"content":"Yeah - me and my brother have recently been playing a campaign on OCTGN, in which we beat every quest first try, except Fog on the Barrow Downs, which took 5 attempts. All because we kept getting stuck in barrows at inopportune moments.\n\nThough the last time we did seem to have it very well sussed out and ended up exploring four of the five Great Barrows on our way to victory."}]}
