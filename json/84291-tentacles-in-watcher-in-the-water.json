I've been playing it that the tentacle just remains engaged with you and able to attack again, rather than return it to the staging area (or even better discard it!).I'm also assuming that whilst a tentacle is attched to a character it doesn't attack anymore.Is this right?Thanks for your patience.Cheers"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84291-tentacles-in-watcher-in-the-water/?do=findComment&comment=799065","commentId":799065,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1369522508,"content":"I think you're referring to the situation where Grasping Tentacle becomes an attachment?

It just nullifies the attack and defence stats for tha character you attach it to. I just wasn't sure what happened if that character dies. "}]}
