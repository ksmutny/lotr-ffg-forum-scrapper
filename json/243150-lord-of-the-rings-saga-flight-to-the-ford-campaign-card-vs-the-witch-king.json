(Any player may trigger this ability.) \"\n\nThe Witch-King's enemy is \"Immune to player card effects. \"\n\nCan I use the campaign card's response against The Witch-King?\n\nThanks.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243150-lord-of-the-rings-saga-flight-to-the-ford-campaign-card-vs-the-witch-king/?do=findComment&comment=2650643","commentId":2650643,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1487689129,"content":"The campaign card is not a player card.
