My guess is that it will be added in the FAQ. Orc Guards are odd in several other ways, e.g. what happens if I don't have any cards left in my deck?

But I think having no cards left will probably hurt you more than those 1/1/1 critters ^^"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46254-orc-guard-q/?do=findComment&comment=464086","commentId":464086,"userName":"jhaelen","timestamp":1304602973,"content":"fabest said:\n\nAnd if you don't have any cards left, you don't create them of course.

In my sole victorious solo game against the third scenario I won before a single orc guard was placed. Since the orc guards, too, get shadow cards, they can get very nasty if don't assign defenders to them, especially once they start piling up."}]}
