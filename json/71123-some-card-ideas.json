If that card is a Treachery card, immediately reveal and resolve it. Otherwise, you may move that card to the bottom of the deck.\n\nRationale: Gandalf repeatedly admonishes Pippin for his Tookish curiosity, which gets the fellowship into trouble more than once.  His action here is meant to capture that, as well as the strange fortune which can accompanies that curiosity.\n\n\nFollow-up\nSphere: Tactics\nCard type: Attachment\nCost: 2\nSkill.\nResponse: After an enemy survives an attack in which the attached hero participates, deal one damage to that enemy.\n\nThis could also be a one-time use event, instead of an attachment.  Originally I had the text \"an enemy with which you are engaged\" in there, but I removed it to make the card more robust.\n\n\nErkenbrand (unique)\nSphere: Leadership\nCard type: Hero\nThreat: 9\nWP: 1\nAtk: 2\nDef: 2\nHP: 4\nIf Erkenbrand is ready at the end of the combat phase, search your deck for one Rohan ally and add it to your hand. Shuffle your deck.\nResponse: After a Rohan character leaves play, choose 1: return that character to your hand, or ready Erkenbrand.\n\nRationale: Erkenbrand leads the men defending the Westfold during the events of The Two Towers.  After the defenses at the Fords of Isen were broken, Erkenbrand and Gandalf had to gather Erkenbrand's scattered forces while riding to Helm's Deep.  Although it probably Gandalf who did the lion's share of gathering (thanks to the speed of Shadowfax), that is the thematic role that I've tried to capture with his ability here.  If anything, his ability is too robust.  But it does fit very well in the \"leadership\" flavor.  Only problem is that his ability will interact with way more Spirit allies than Leadership ones!  Should this be a Spirit hero?  Also, I am not really happy with his stats… just didn't want to overpower him.\n\n \n\nThat's all… just a couple of things I wanted to share! Thanks for reading.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71123-some-card-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=694635","commentId":694635,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347809167,"content":"hey\n\nheres some i had and posted a while back based around the shire\n\nOldToby\n\nattatchment- spirit\n\ncost 2\n\nattatch to a hobbit character. character gains:\n\nRefresh action.

You may move that card to the bottom of the encounter deck. Until the end of the phase, treachery cards gain surge.\n\nErkenbrand is VERY strong. Even if you removed the static part of his text, the response part is still really strong. The ability to block with a snowborn scout every turn is too good, its a feint and an Asfaloth all in one!\n\nSomething like this still fits the theme but feels more balanced.\n\nResponse: If a Rohan ally leaves play, chose 1: put that ally on top of your deck or ready Erkenbrand."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71123-some-card-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=694738","commentId":694738,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1347819576,"content":"Theodan (unique)\nSphere: Leadership\nCard type: Hero\nThreat: 10\nWP: 2\nAtk: 2\nDef: 2\nHP: 5\n\nrohan. noble.\n\nResponse:  After questing succesfully all rohan characters gain +1 atk until the end of the turn\n\nSince most of the Rohan characters are focused around willpower and passing thru quests; I thought it would be cool for Theodan to inspire and motivate his warriors after making progress\n\nDenethor (unique)\nSphere: Leadership\nCard type: Hero\nThreat: 8\nWP: 1\nAtk: 1\nDef: 3\nHP: 3\n\ngondor. noble. steward.\n\n \n\nAt the beginning of the turn, if you control at least 5 noble characters, shuffle the bottom two cards of your discard pile back into your deck.\n\nWanted to have a character that finally takes advantage of the noble trait; kind of makes sense too that Nobles would want to \"sustain\" their blood line and there arent too many card effects that suffle cards back in\n\n \n\nGaladriel (unique)\nSphere: Spirit\nCard type: Hero\nThreat: 13\nWP: 4\nAtk: 1\nDef: 1\nHP: 4\n\nSilvan.

(limit once per turn)\n\nA pretty powerful card for a pretty powerful character in the LOTR universe.  Silvan is also another trait that has been neglected so far i wanted to take advantage of; i also wanted to keep with the \"spirit\" theme of decreasing threat.  Tried to offset the powerful effect by tying it to the players hand which is normally pretty crucial.  The high starting threat is part of the attempted balance"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71123-some-card-ideas/?do=findComment&comment=694890","commentId":694890,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1347829480,"content":" also realized i want to make a new Legolas and Gimili (only fair since Aragorn got a 2nd version)\n\nGimli (unique)\nSphere: Spirit\nCard type: Hero\nThreat: 11\nWP: 2\nAtk: 2\nDef: 2\nHP: 5\n\nDwarf.
