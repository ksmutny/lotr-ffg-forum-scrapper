Or it is me? ^^ Specially about Dunedain trait, what do you think? Any different idea in some trait?\n\nEdited February 11, 2016 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202273-traits-and-its-sense/?do=findComment&comment=2047575","commentId":2047575,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1455232626,"content":"Have you confused Gondor with Outlands?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202273-traits-and-its-sense/?do=findComment&comment=2047578","commentId":2047578,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1455232819,"content":"I'd say Gondor tries to leverage wealth (Blood of Numenor, Gondorian Fire, Leadership Boromir, Visionary Leadership)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202273-traits-and-its-sense/?do=findComment&comment=2047627","commentId":2047627,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1455235406,"content":"Gondor has the highest number of high quality defensive bonuses, because they were the wall against Mordor.\n\nRohan has tons of abilities that trigger off discard, because they were so desperate in their selfless fight against Isengard."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/202273-traits-and-its-sense/?do=findComment&comment=2047654","commentId":2047654,"userName":"chrsjxn","timestamp":1455236615,"content":"Dwarves discard cards off the top of the deck to represent their skill at mining.\n\n \n\nEnts come into play exhausted because they are slow to action.\n\n \n\nNoldor discard cards to represent the elves heading into the West during the third age, though some of them (Glorfindel) come back.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIt's interesting that the discard pile is used to represent a few different things thematically.
