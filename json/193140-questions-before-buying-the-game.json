From there if they want to expand, I always point towards the first cycle—The Shadows of Mirkwood. Not because these quests and player cards are the BEST (they aren’t, though most of the quests are very solid and enjoyable) but because they are designed specifically to slowly teach players the finer points of the game quest-by-quest.

Can't wait to hear your thoughts on the game when you get to dig into it. \n\n \n\n \n\n> buying a second core set is a good idea also.\n\n \n\nMaybe...\n\n \n\nAs someone who owns two Core Sets, I certainly don't think it's a BAD idea to get a second one. Some of the single and double cards in the Core can be very clutch in some decks and you want to be able to put a full play-set into a deck to make it more efficient. \n\n \n\nBut I played the game for years before getting a second Core Set and while I DID occasionally wish for a couple more Unexpected Courages or a third Northern Tracker I never felt the game was lacking without them. All things considered, I think you would get more bang for your buck getting the first 2 or 3 Adventure Packs rather than pay for a few more copies of cards you already have. \n\n \n\nYMMV of course, a lot of people would probably agree with @vilainn6 that consistency is king but for me the extra Quests and greater variety of player cards wins out--especially in a coop game. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193140-questions-before-buying-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1890068","commentId":1890068,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1447277744,"content":"Sleeves and proxies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193140-questions-before-buying-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1890078","commentId":1890078,"userName":"gandalfDK","timestamp":1447278067,"content":"Ftw"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193140-questions-before-buying-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1891576","commentId":1891576,"userName":"Leveton","timestamp":1447369435,"content":"I played my first solo quest yesterday: Passage Through Mirkwood with the Leadership starter deck.

And some lucky draws! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nThe starter decks are honestly pretty weak but the Leadership one is probably the best of them if only because it's the most well-rounded. Lore and Spirit have some great clutch effects, but suffer from lack of offensive ability. Tactics is probably the hardest of the Core starters to play well--a lot of great combat ability but almost NOTHING else. \n\n \n\nWhen you start deck building, a good starting place can be Leadership/Spirit (probably Aragorn/Eowyn/Theodred) since that has some built in resource smoothing with Eowyn discard/Stand and Fight and Celebrian Stone.\n\n \n\nHave fun!\n\nEdited November 13, 2015 by JonofPDX"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193140-questions-before-buying-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1892305","commentId":1892305,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1447424264,"content":"Exactly what JonofPDX says above.\n\nReally glad you enjoyed it, sounds like a good game.\n\nIts worth trying passage through Mirkwood with each of the starter decks individually because that really really teaches you the initial strengths and weaknesses of the spheres (dont expect to win though with some, especially tactics).\n\nThen my own take on the other two core scenarios:\n\nAnduin: lots of fun and good thematic theme with good variety in the quest stages (raft riding is fun picking off enemies from the bank) but.... the Hill Troll is a big challenge for new players and takes some beating and clever deck thinking.

Glad you were able to find a friend to play with that enjoys the game!\n\n \n\nRight out of Core I know a lot of people playing 2-player gravitated towards setting up one Aggressive Tactics/Leadership deck designed to engage and defeat enemies while the other player ran a more Willpower oriented Spirit/Lore deck designed to  push through Questing and provide support and cancellation effects. It’s a combination that can work pretty well but it does suffer from neither deck being particularly well-rounded, which can get you in trouble if you hit a bad flop from the Encounter deck. Personally with the available cardpool in the Core Set I’m more of a fan of Leadership/Spirit (for resource acceleration/fixing and cancels) and Tactics/Lore (for card draw and healing your big hitters) but half the fun of a game like this is exploring new combos--the important part is that you guys are having fun. \n\n \n\nYou might want to stick with 40-card decks for now, though, and slowly work your way up to “Tournament Legal” 50-card decks. You’ll be able to get a little more consistency and be able to be a little more choosey about the cards you slot in until you get some APs and move up to 50 cards.\n\n \n\nCome back and update us when you hit the Anduin! It’s a big jump in difficulty but still one of my favorite quests.

Guess I should have explained myself a bit more. \n\n \n\nI don't usually use Ravens of the Mountain for its progress ability. That’s a nice bit of gravy but the real reason I usually use it (in conjunction with Henamarth) is as a cancel.\n\n \n\nI’m going to be dropping Henemarth every turn anyway to take a peek at the deck for the next round. If I see something I don’t want coming out in staging (a bad treachery, for instance) I’ll play Ravens to make it go away and hopefully get something better for me. And even if it is something just as bad I’ll probably get some free progress. Plus I’ll still have the knowledge of what’s coming so I won’t have wasted Henamarth’s ability. "}]}
