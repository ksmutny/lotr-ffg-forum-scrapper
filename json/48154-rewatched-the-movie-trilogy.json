He starts off looking into one to spy on Sauron. So his ability and his placement in Lore actually makes a lot of sense. But eventually Sauron realizes what Denethor is doing and makes sure to show him as much of his power and destruction as possible. This drives Denethor into despair because it makes him think Sauron's victory is absolutely inevitable, eventually to the point of defeatism and suicide. He doesn't come across as very heroic in either version, but then we see him after he's already going crazy.\n\nDwarves are mostly offscreen in both the LotR books and movies besides Gimli (they're not extinct in the movies; Moria was not the only Dwarf settlement and I think they reference this in the extended editions), but in The Hobbit they play a major role. There are 13 of them, plus an army at the end!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48154-rewatched-the-movie-trilogy/?do=findComment&comment=483308","commentId":483308,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1307691888,"content":"Mestrahd said:\n\nSo I just finished watching the movies again.

The character in the book is indeed becoming mad but not just out of senility, there are reasons to most of his deeds.

This is coming from a fan of the film trilogy but not a blind one who would not see mistakes.\n\nI'd recommend reading the books. You shall not regret.
