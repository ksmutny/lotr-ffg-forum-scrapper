Resources belong to your individual heroes - they don't share them with the rest of your team. Anything that belongs to those heroes would be put out of play or discarded.

Next to that, FFG spoilered an objective card for the next AP, which also gets resource tokens placed on it. If you knew the card text (I don't want to spoiler it here in case you don't), you'd agree that it assumes that the resource tokens are automatically removed when this card leaves play again, otherwise this objective card wouldn't make sense. So I assume whenever any card leaves play, any tokens or attachments of it are usually discarded."}]}
