If the ring were originally designed for Gandalf, lore-wise I would've liked a buffing effect on allies or other heroes. But it was Cirdan's, and I don't know enough about him to take a guess. One thing - it probably won't add a resource icon like the other rings, since he already has them all."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126686-narya-what-will-it-do/?do=findComment&comment=1327941","commentId":1327941,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1415551345,"content":"It will have to do with a general buff of something... It's the best way to depict that theme IMO. Or maybe something to just heroes."}]}
