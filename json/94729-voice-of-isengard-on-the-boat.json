For a couple of hours (maybe more) there was the picture of an elf. Later it was changed by the Rohirrim.\n\nEdited December 6, 2013 by Jekzer"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94729-voice-of-isengard-on-the-boat/?do=findComment&comment=924831","commentId":924831,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1386374805,"content":">  \n> \n> > ....Haldir, who appeared to be spoiled accidentally so long ago.\n> \n> Wait, what?\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nIf you call just the art of a possibly elf hero to be a Haldir spoiler, then yeah. But the art does seem to be Haldir.

I read on the website that when it moves to \"on the boat\" status that means we should expect it to arrive in stores in 4-6 weeks. So, at the earliest, beginning of January, at the latest, mid-January.\n\n \n\nAs for the second hero, although I am still pulling for Haldir, I would not be surprised if we saw Treebeard instead, since at least one of the quests in this expansion will be going into Fangorn Forest it seems from the previews. I don't think it is likely, but it would also make sense for him to show up. If so, he would probably be similar to Beorn from the Hobbit Saga, in that he will be beefy and strong, but have some sort of immunity built in. Fun to speculate at least..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/94729-voice-of-isengard-on-the-boat/?do=findComment&comment=925017","commentId":925017,"userName":"Scroll Lock","timestamp":1386412020,"content":"Rohan, Silvan, Dunland, Ents- I can't ask for better cycle.\n\nI don't think that we will see Treebeard as a hero in VoI.
