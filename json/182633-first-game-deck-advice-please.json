I don't mean the most effective here, but the simplest to use in terms of the cards and their abilities.\n\n \n\n2. My deck: Which is the best deck for me to play to complement the above?

Managed to sneak in couple of games this morning - in the first one I switched Beravor for Denethor (other heroes are Theodred and Eowyn) which basically bought me 2 extra rounds to prepare and it made a huge difference. However, late game I really suffered from lack of cards.\n\n \n\nSo for the next game I added some card draw. Took me 15 turns (which I'm guessing isn't great) and Denethor bought it right at the end due to a nasty shadow effect, but it I finally got a win and it was very satisfying :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n> About the Sagas, sounds great!  the one thing is that this game gets tougher the later the quests were put out, so black riders quests shouldn't be that bad, you can probably managed the road darkens, But when you get to Saruman and play helms deep, you will have problems beating it with just core and saga.  well good luck!\n\n \n\nThat's good to know, thanks for the heads up.

The Treason of Saruman will be hard though.\n\n \n\nDead Marshes is a very good addition in terms of player cards. If you wanted to get the most out of Gimli, the player cards in Khazad-dum would definitely be helpful. If you wanted to build a Rohan deck for defending Helm's Deep and defeating Saruman, I would recommend also getting Voice of Isengard (Eomer, Rohan Warhorse/Westfold Horse-breeder, doomed cards).

Where its practical, I'd like to theme the decks as much as possible (e.g. hobbits for Black Riders and Road Darkens), so Rohan for Helms Deep would be cool.

But it also means there are vert very few dead cards in your collection. You will have a card you never thought useful, then all of a sudden a quest appears that makes that card priceless. So you really get value from your collection and often have to redesign your deck to suit a really hard or unusual scenario.\n\nIve never found that with 1vs1 card games as they always have tons of cards you never use.
