There is nothing in the rules that let you do it, so you can not do it.\n\nThe only time you are allowed to play attachments is during the planning phase and that specifies \"a player can play ally and attachment cards from his hand.\" (Emphases mine)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47338-question-about-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=474603","commentId":474603,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1306333818,"content":"From what I understand you can re-attach a unique attachment ONLY with a second copy being paid for, which will discard the first copy.

The rules are on page 8 under Unique cards and I reproduced the relevant section below.\n\n \n\nIf any player has a unique card in play, no player can play or put into play another card with the same title. Any attempt to do so will fail to the extent that the card attempting to enter play remains in its current location (hand, deck, discard pile) and does not enter play. This rule applies to all unique hero, ally, attachment, and event cards that might enter play. Note that a unique card is eligible to enter play if another card with the same title is in a player’s discard pile but not currently in play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47338-question-about-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=474618","commentId":474618,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1306334942,"content":"Mestrahd said:\n\n \n\nFrom what I understand you can re-attach a unique attachment ONLY with a second copy being paid for, which will discard the first copy. So if you want a Steward on Theodred instead of Aragorn, just recruit the second copy onto Theo and the first will be discarded by game rule.\n \n\n \n\nThis is the rule for restricted attachments, not unique ones. A second copy of a unique attachment cannot be put into play, P.8 rulebook. If a character would have a third restricted attachment put on him/her, then one of the prior ones must be discarded. This wouldn't work for Steward either, as it is not restricted.\n\nI have however, being dreaming of a card that would allow to swap an attachment from one hero to another. So often, in a tri-sphere deck, one of your heros ends up with tons of counters and not much to use them for anymore. If would be great to take the Steward and move it to another hero for whom you have some cards he could play but cannot muster resources quickly enough to do so. However, this would make the Steward an even more powerful card than it already is, and it is just about the best attachment out there.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47338-question-about-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=474724","commentId":474724,"userName":"Lizalfos","timestamp":1306346450,"content":" Related question: Can I play an attachment on another player's character?  I think the rules said it is played to your play area, but I wasn't sure if that meant me specifically or \"you\" plural as in all players."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47338-question-about-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=474732","commentId":474732,"userName":"Apophenia","timestamp":1306347917,"content":"Adam said:\n\n Related question: Can I play an attachment on another player's character?  I think the rules said it is played to your play area, but I wasn't sure if that meant me specifically or \"you\" plural as in all players.\n\n\n\nYes, this is mentioned in the Control and Ownership section on page 25. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47338-question-about-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=474733","commentId":474733,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1306347957,"content":"Yes you can attach to your ally's characters."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47338-question-about-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=474764","commentId":474764,"userName":"Lizalfos","timestamp":1306354613,"content":"Whoa, thanks for pointing that out.  I actually had reread the rules earlier and saw that it pretty clearly stated that when a player plays an attachment, it is played to HIS play area (planning step page).  Seems like a pretty glaring mistake, but the passage you guys point out is thankfully explicit enough that it's clear it's the correct version."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47338-question-about-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=480480","commentId":480480,"userName":"Reanu","timestamp":1307264239,"content":"Can a player attach more than one attachment to ONE hero?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47338-question-about-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=480485","commentId":480485,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1307265589,"content":"Yes.
