Especially with the two side quests that help add damage.\n\nWho did you have defending? My point was the silvans are fine as long as you have a defender in addition, which would not be silvan, unless you put ancestral armor on Thranduil and heal him....."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/287785-fire-in-the-night-released/?do=findComment&comment=3578177","commentId":3578177,"userName":"player1683311","timestamp":1546149187,"content":"> 1 hour ago, alcuin18 said:\n> \n> Quick question: I still haven't bought the first two packs in this cycle but do you guys think I should buy this one first?
