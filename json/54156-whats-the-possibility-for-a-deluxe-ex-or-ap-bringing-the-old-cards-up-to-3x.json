I'd say about zero. Bit of a shame, as LoTR has more redundancy than other core sets (i.e. if you buy a 3rd AGoT core set, you'll still be able to use 100 or so cards, 3rd LoTR core gives u about 12 useable cards.) but the discussion has been hasd before, and there's never been much sign of change."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54156-whats-the-possibility-for-a-deluxe-ex-or-ap-bringing-the-old-cards-up-to-3x/?do=findComment&comment=536706","commentId":536706,"userName":"Cletus","timestamp":1317707301,"content":"Sounds like a good PoD candidate.

My point was that if players want to use POD cards, then sleeves are a must.

I just saw 6 AP's in Call of Cthulhu, that's a whole cycle. The reason for these AP's is, quote:\n\n\"A standalone set of Asylum Packs for the Call of Cthulhu. Forgotten Lore features cards that have been previously printed and are now formatted in the 60-card Asylum Pack format that adds 3 copies each of 20 distinct cards to a player's collection. These cards have been updated to reflect the most current FAQ and errata (at the time of printing). These cards expand on the decks in the Call of Cthulhu Core Set, and allow players to customize and create decks of their own.\"\n\nOne of the reasons is to update the cards, yes, BUT apparently FFG think it's a good idea to make these AP's beside update their core sets. So no matter if you are fan enough to buy 3x core set or to buy the core set reprinted updates they also thought of the players that wouldn't go to that length.\n\nNow CoC has been around way longer so there might be a bigger need for this in that game than LOTR.
