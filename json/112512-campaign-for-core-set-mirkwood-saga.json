But anyway here are the rules I thought of:\n\n> Setup:\n> \n> Each player choses 1-3 heroes and has to stick with them for the whole campaign.\n> \n> The campaign card is placed to the side of the Quest Cards and will be resolved parallel to the Quest Card.\n> \n> End of game:\n> \n> - do NOT reset threat count\n> \n> - All the damage that is assigned to a hero it will stay there.\n> \n> - If an hero is in the Discard Pile at the end of the game can't be used anymore unless they are revived.\n> \n> - All other cards will be put back into your deck (except Unique Characters).\n> \n> After the Adventure is finished the XP are calculated :\n> \n> XP = ( Difficulty Level * (15/X )) + Victory points\n> \n> X = Number of Players\n> \n> Victory/Defeat\n> \n> - If the players win the game they earn the full 100% of the XP.\n> \n> - If they lose the players lower their threat by 5 points, but only earn only 50% of the XP.\n> \n> Heal/Revive Heros\n> \n> The players can revive the heroes that are placed in the Discard Pile at the end of the adventure. To do that the players have to pay double the Threat Cost of that Hero.\n> \n> To heal heros the player has to pay 1 XP per damage.\n> \n> Unique Characters:\n> \n> Players can keep Unique Characters and use them in the next adventure. The costs to do so is 3 times the costs of that character.\n> \n> Threat Count\n> \n> The players can lower their threat count for 1 XP per threat point.\n> \n> Buy new cards\n> \n> The players can expand their card pool by buying more cards. The costs are:\n> \n> - Heros: 2 times their Threat Cost\n> \n> - other Cards: Cost + 2\n> \n> The rest of the rules stays the same.\n\nI know the calculation of the XP is not ideal but I can't think of a better alternative. I'll appreciate new ideas.\n\nI hope that I soon have the time to translate the Cards (Campaign, Boon, Burden, Allys…) and upload them here.\n\nspiderseverywhkfznpmojbc.png [http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/spiderseverywhkfznpmojbc.png] [http://www.fotos-hochladen.net]\n\nspiderseverywhs98u3gtioj.png [http://img5.fotos-hochladen.net/uploads/spiderseverywhs98u3gtioj.png] [http://www.fotos-hochladen.net]\n\nEdited August 6, 2014 by Aelindir"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112512-campaign-for-core-set-mirkwood-saga/?do=findComment&comment=1184072","commentId":1184072,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1407241862,"content":"Nice idea....\n\n \n\nOne minor repair: On the setup, after the \"X-1 copies of Forest Spider\" you should mention \"(to a minimum of 1)\" because if not, then in a single player you don't add any forest spider.\n\n \n\n \n\nWhat is this XP?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112512-campaign-for-core-set-mirkwood-saga/?do=findComment&comment=1184073","commentId":1184073,"userName":"Aelindir","timestamp":1407242017,"content":"> Nice idea....\n> \n>  \n> \n> One minor repair: On the setup, after the \"X-1 copies of Forest Spider\" you should mention \"(to a minimum of 1)\" because if not, then in a single player you don't add any forest spider.\n> \n>  \n> \n>  \n> \n> What is this XP?\n\n \n\nThanks, I will change that :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nXP = Experience Points, Points you gain for completing an adventure and you can use to heal heros..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/112512-campaign-for-core-set-mirkwood-saga/?do=findComment&comment=1186164","commentId":1186164,"userName":"Aelindir","timestamp":1407351327,"content":"Sorry I totally forgot to Mention that you do NOT reset your threat count After each adventure.

One forest spider came from the quest. So the idea behind that \"X-1 copies\" was, that there is a spider for every player. I playtested the campaign in German and the \"x-1\" was one of my feedback points. It was before \"x copies\". So, if you play with 4 players you need 5 forest spiders (one from the quest and four from the campaign). And there are only 4 copies in the deck. And the solo player had 2 spiders in the beginning - that is very hard."}]}
