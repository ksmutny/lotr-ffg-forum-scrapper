I think it's very telling that Galadriel was revealed and is from the 5th adventure pack in the cycle, when usually a hero of that magnitude would be a finale hero. I also sort of wonder if we will get a Narya card that affects the Gandalfs we already have, perhaps keeping them around or reducing their threat per turn cost. I dunno, just very optimistic we might actually see Mithrandir in hero form!\n\nEdited May 9, 2014 by Chris51261"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105910-chances-of-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=1079069","commentId":1079069,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1399666391,"content":"They could call him Mithrandir and not have the problem of the allies not being playable I suppose."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105910-chances-of-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=1079122","commentId":1079122,"userName":"klaymen_sk","timestamp":1399668403,"content":"That would be technically right, but I shudder at the thought of having Mithrandir and Gandalf in play.
