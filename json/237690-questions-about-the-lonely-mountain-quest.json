If yes, can he get multiple attacks in a row if I keep getting shadow cards with burgle effects? Can I cancel these shadows?\n\n \n\nRegarding the burgle mechanic, what happens if when attempting to make a burgle, I reveal a neutral card in the top of my deck and I have to match sphere?\n\nEdited December 22, 2016 by Rajam"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/237690-questions-about-the-lonely-mountain-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2555693","commentId":2555693,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1482446933,"content":"Yes, Smaug gets a new shadow card, so yes he can get multiple attacks in a row. You can cancel the shadows, but cancelling the shadow only cancels the shadow effect, so it doesn't help you with the Burgle chaingun problem. For that you want to discard the shadow cards before you flip them over.\n\n \n\nIf you need to match sphere of a neutral card, you need a neutral card to match with it.\n\nEdited December 23, 2016 by PocketWraith"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/237690-questions-about-the-lonely-mountain-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2555960","commentId":2555960,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1482462390,"content":"But neutral is not a sphere!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/237690-questions-about-the-lonely-mountain-quest/?do=findComment&comment=2556154","commentId":2556154,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1482476155,"content":"As I recall, if playing progression style, the only way to stop the Smaug chain gun is to play Dawn Take You All (solo or multi-player), or by sending Rider of the Mark to another player (multi-player only).
