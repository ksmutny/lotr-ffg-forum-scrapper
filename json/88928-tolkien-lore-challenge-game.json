Oh boy this is tough.\n\nPalantir was made by the Eldars of West, so certainly a skilled High Elf or servants of Aule comes to my mind.\n\nBut Celebrimbor, greatest elven smith of 3rd age, lacked the knowledge to even create the Rings of Power without aid of Sauron at first, so probably safe to assume Celebrimbor couldn't do it (his version of Elf Stone is mentioned to be less effective than original as well, so I highly doubt he can replicate Palantir).\n\nIt is mentioned by Gandalf that Palantir was above Saruman and Sauron as well, 2 Maiars that were in service of Aule. So it's probably safe to assume no other Maiar in Middle Earth at the end of Third Age could create as well (including Gandalf).\n\n \n\nSo with Maiars of Aule and Elven Smithes out of picture, only other being that I can think of that comes even remotely close is Tom Bombadil.\n\nBut there is no evidence that Tom Bombadil has power to replicate Palantir, and he certainly wouldn't want to... besides we don't even know what Tom Bombadil is (... if we disregard how Tom is obviously Witch-King in disguise XD).\n\n \n\nOther far-fetched ideas included Galadriel and Glorfindel, they are the only known 1st Age Elves residing in Middle-Earth. They are both golden haired and therefore has Vanyar blood in them as well as Noldor, and are possibly the wisest Elves around.... yet they were warrior and ruler, not smithes.\n\n \n\nI feel like this is some kind of trick question, with *create* being emphasized...\n\neither way I'm stomped and out of ideas.\n\nEdited August 22, 2013 by Ellareth"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847100","commentId":847100,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1377164497,"content":"Crazy shot, but since they were supposed to be made by Feanor - if I'm not mistaken- it could be either Galadriel (who was there when they where made I think) or Elrond as a distant grandson who knew the secret ...\n\n \n\ntoo childish :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847148","commentId":847148,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1377171018,"content":"Maybe it is just because of me not being a native speaker, but didn't Fingolfin just stabbed at Morgoth's foot, instead of chopping it off?\n\n \n\nA very nice thread, by the way."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847151","commentId":847151,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1377171202,"content":"Great post, Ellareth!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847166","commentId":847166,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1377172366,"content":"> Maybe it is just because of me not being a native speaker, but didn't Fingolfin just stabbed at Morgoth's foot, instead of chopping it off?\n> \n>  \n> \n> A very nice thread, by the way.\n\n \n\nYes he stabbed it indeed, it was not completely choped off, but ok I did not want to be that specifique ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847267","commentId":847267,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377180074,"content":"perhaps if we are stuck then danpoage could give a clue...such as which source is needed to find the answer?\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88928-tolkien-lore-challenge-game/?do=findComment&comment=847293","commentId":847293,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1377181551,"content":"Ellareth's post was great, but it was a trick question.

The word that Tolkien used was \"hewed\", but I always chose to interpret that as \"took a big chunk of demon flesh out of\" because it makes the battle that much more epic.
