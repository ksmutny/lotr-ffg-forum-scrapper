During setup if the encounter card(s) drawn have no effect are they discarded? Example: During the setup of \"an unexpected party\" i am to draw one encounter card per player. If this encounter card was \"more like a grocer\" that reads \"when revealed: discard all baggin sphere resources.\" I would just discard the card as i have no resources yet so it has no effect.\n\nif this is the case then i easily completed the first challenge by just committing all my heroes. The revealed cards in the quest phase also did nothing or were not applicable.\n\n2. Do i skip any phases on the first turn such as the resources phase?\n\n4. Finally, when i complete a quest by adding all the required progress tokens what are the steps taken to continue to the next quest? is it resolved immediately upon completion or do i wait until the start of the next round? Do any excess will apply to adding progress tokens to the newly revealed quest?\n\n \n\nThanks!\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69518-playing-my-first-game-and-i-have-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=677679","commentId":677679,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1345483881,"content":"hoduken said:\n\n \n\n1.

X must be killed….no tokens are carried\n\nrich\n\nPS first game and you have the hobbit? lucky you…still havnt got my copy haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69518-playing-my-first-game-and-i-have-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=677699","commentId":677699,"userName":"hoduken","timestamp":1345485742,"content":"i work at a game store so i just bought everything they make since i figured my friends would play even if i didn't like it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69518-playing-my-first-game-and-i-have-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=677700","commentId":677700,"userName":"hoduken","timestamp":1345485826,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ntreacheries without effect go to discard pile\n\n\n\n \n\nso just to clarify, this does count as one card i drew even though it had no effect?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69518-playing-my-first-game-and-i-have-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=677720","commentId":677720,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1345486887,"content":"hoduken said:\n\nrichsabre said:\n\n \n\ntreacheries without effect go to discard pile\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nso just to clarify, this does count as one card i drew even though it had no effect?\n\n\n\nsure- think of it as a lucky draw :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"}]}
