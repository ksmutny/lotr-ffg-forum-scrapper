I am just now sitting down to play. I had a quick question that I may have missed in all the rules and tutorials I have seen...when building the player deck, do i use each card in the sphere of influence for the heros I chose? Even the duplicates? I guess I was confused about whether or not only single versions of each card get shuffled into the player decks.\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58248-newbie-question/?do=findComment&comment=573135","commentId":573135,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1325343118,"content":"if you mean the single sphere deck then yes all the cards and 1 copy of gandalf, if you mean a multi sphere deck its completely up to you, when making a deck the rules are\n\n \n\n50 cards min.\n\nno more than three copies of each card allowed in a deck\n\nyou can have multiple copies of uniques in a deck but only one is allowed in play at a time"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58248-newbie-question/?do=findComment&comment=573145","commentId":573145,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1325343891,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nif you mean the single sphere deck then yes all the cards and 1 copy of gandalf, if you mean a multi sphere deck its completely up to you, when making a deck the rules are\n\n \n\n50 cards min.\n\nno more than three copies of each card allowed in a deck\n\nyou can have multiple copies of uniques in a deck but only one is allowed in play at a time\n\n\n\nYes Thank You. I was referring to the sphere deck. You answered my question.\n\nI have another though. The first game example in the core set rule book (p10) says \"each player chooses one of the four spheres of influence and uses the starter deck for that sphere.\" I noticed however in the example of the Play Field Setup on p11 that \"Tom\" and \"Kris\" chose Hero's from two different Sphere's. I assume the Rule book just starts the player out with a single sphere of influence for the first game?\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58248-newbie-question/?do=findComment&comment=573146","commentId":573146,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1325344289,"content":"yes i think the idea in the book was that it would be too complicated to do multi sphere for your first game, for your first couple i would recommend just taking a bash at each sphere to get thier flavour"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58248-newbie-question/?do=findComment&comment=573154","commentId":573154,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1325347062,"content":"Thank you.

Do you have to commit players to a quest? In a single player game, can u skip this quest phase if you don't have nearly enough willpower to avoid the hit to your threat points?\n\n\n\n \n\n1. Aragorn's ability has to be triggered right after he was committed to the quest. I had also a hard time to understand the whole meaning of the \"response\" effect. So listen carefully: a response is  triggered right after a certain event happens that is ususally described on the card that includes the \"reaction\". \"After\" should be read as \"right after\". Have a close look at the descriptions for the several keywords in the rulebook and in the FAQ. It's very helpful!\n\nSo in your case Aragorn already had been readied before you revealed the encounter card, if you had used his ability. You could have readied another character in that case.\n\n \n\n2. Players don't have to commit characters to a quest, but they cannot skip the quest phase. If you send no character questing, you have a total WP of 0. Which means that you have to add the total amount oft hreat in the staging area to your threat level."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58248-newbie-question/?do=findComment&comment=573459","commentId":573459,"userName":"xris","timestamp":1325438956,"content":"hendersondayton said:\n\n1.

As such, Location cards don't really have anything to do with other Responses, Heroes or otherwise.\n\nRepeat the mantra: Follow the Phases happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\nAragorn's response applies during the Quest Phase.\nLocation card response's applies during the Travel Phase.\n\nBy the time the Location response appears, the Quest Phase is over. Plus, I'm not sure why you seem confused over this. During the Quest Phase, Aragorn can ready himself at a cost of 1 resource. During the Location Phase, Old Forest Road can ready one of the first player's Characters. This can be any character, not just Aragorn, why do you think these two responses are linked?\n\nhendersondayton said:\n\n2. Do you have to commit players to a quest? In a single player game, can u skip this quest phase if you don't have nearly enough willpower to avoid the hit to your threat points?\n\nYou MUST perform the Quest Phase, even if none of your characters are committed. You are not allowed to skip the phase just because you decide none of your characters are Questing this turn.\n\nI would suggest you download the following from BoardGameGeek [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/] > Comprehensive Card Reference & Unofficial FAQ [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/66894/comprehensive-card-reference-unofficial-faq]\n\nIt will help tremendously!
