This is because there are only certain times during the round when actions can be played, and the staging step is not one of those times. However, once all the encounter cards are revealed, and before you total up the threat and resolve the quest, there is an action window. This will not help you save yourself from the Necromancer's Reach, but it means you could play Sneak Attack+Gandalf to kill an enemy in the staging area, which could make the difference between questing successfully and unsuccessfully.\n\n \n\nLearning about all the action windows is hard, but very rewarding to your success rate. It might be handy to have a reference like this one (http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf [http://www.kaybee.org/kirk/LoTR_LCG_QuickRef.pdf]) nearby as you are learning the game. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/189040-response-to-treacheries/?do=findComment&comment=1811036","commentId":1811036,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1442887256,"content":"I keep a laminated copy of the kaybee quick reference guide nearby when playing and it is a godsend.
