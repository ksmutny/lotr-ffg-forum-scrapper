Beorn states, \"cannot have attachments.\" Does this mean the card is simply discarded? Or, is there a distinct difference between \"player attachment cards\" and \"encounter deck condition attachment cards?\" I am quite confused on this one.

Here is his answer:\n\n \n\n> Hi Jörg,\n> Because Beorn cannot have attachments, he is not a legal target for Local Trouble so you will have to choose a different hero to attach it to. For example, if your heroes are Beorn, Theoden, Hama and Local Trouble is revealed, you would have to attach it to Theoden. If another Local Trouble is revealed, then you would have to attach it to Hama.\n> Cheers,\n> Caleb\n\n \n\nAnd I had so much hoped to make this scenario a bit easier...\n\nEdited April 24, 2014 by leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78723-question-about-pip-local-trouble-card/?do=findComment&comment=1059864","commentId":1059864,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1398299405,"content":"He does make it a bit easier - if you draw local trouble 3 times you get to discard the 3rd :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/78723-question-about-pip-local-trouble-card/?do=findComment&comment=1060018","commentId":1060018,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1398310465,"content":"By the strict language on the cards it should be discarded.
