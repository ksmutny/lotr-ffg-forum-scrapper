We have cards like Waters of the Nimrodel and Daughter of Nimrodel that focus on healing.\n\nIf we would ever see a hero Nimrodel what do you reckon her ability or stats would be? (She's famous for getting lost)\n\nI reckon something possibly to add to either Secrecy, Healing or the Victory Display mechanic (which would be my preference).\n\nWhat are your thoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282725-nimrodel-in-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=3472112","commentId":3472112,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1537111022,"content":"Nimrodel passed long before the game takes place. \n\nThere's a river named after her."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282725-nimrodel-in-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=3472607","commentId":3472607,"userName":"Bendrie","timestamp":1537156782,"content":"Oh, from what I've read she simply got lost and hasn't been found.\n\nOH WELL, never mind then. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282725-nimrodel-in-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=3472937","commentId":3472937,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1537188855,"content":"To be fair, it's not certain that Nimrodel passed from middle earth (either by death or ship), but she hasn't been seen in a very long time so that's the way to bet.  Though she is prone to long naps...."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/282725-nimrodel-in-lcg/?do=findComment&comment=3472985","commentId":3472985,"userName":"icabod","timestamp":1537191212,"content":"Probably held captive inside a tree by that Bombadil chap.
