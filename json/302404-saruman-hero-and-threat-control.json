Which cards allow to reduce threat of more than 1 bypassing saruman negative ability?\n\nEasy answer. There aren't any. Even if a card doesn't use the word 'reduce', if the value on your threat dial goes down then you are still reducing your threat. The best you can hope for is to reduce your threat by 1 multiple times.\n\nIf you want to reduce your threat by more than 1 at a time then you need to get rid of Saruman."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302404-saruman-hero-and-threat-control/?do=findComment&comment=3830768","commentId":3830768,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1573999800,"content":"> 11 minutes ago, PocketWraith said:\n> \n> Easy answer.

I'm not so sure."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302404-saruman-hero-and-threat-control/?do=findComment&comment=3830823","commentId":3830823,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1574005912,"content":"> 51 minutes ago, Halberto said:\n> \n> So sure new event which set your threat at 40 doesn't apply? I'm not so sure.\n\nReproducing parts of the rulings I linked above:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> In every case where card text says that your threat “cannot be reduced” it means that the actual value on your threat dial cannot go down. This is important because there are several ‘threat reduction’ effects in the game that do not use the word reduce.\n> \n> For example, Elrond’s Counsel says “lower your threat by 3” but I think players understand that if I cannot reduce my threat, then I cannot use Elrond’s Counsel to lower it either. \n> \n> Similarly, if I cannot reduce my threat then I cannot ‘set’ my threat to a value that is lower than my current one because I would have to reduce it in order to do that.\n\nand\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Any effect that causes the value of threat dial to go down is reducing your threat. Ramshackle Manor prevents your threat dial from being decreased by more than 1 each round. So if Ramshackle Manor is in play when Favor of the Valar triggers, you cannot reduce your threat by more than 1. If your threat is still 50 or higher after the effect resolves, then you will still be eliminated.\n\nEssentially, in the Pillars situation with threat >40, I believe Saruman fires a replacement effect for the \"set\" sentence, reducing your threat by 1 instead—this is despite the fact that Pillars does not use the word \"reduce\", as the rulings show that the precise word is not necessary for Saruman's limitation to apply. (And Ramshackle Manor uses very similar wording to Saruman.)\n\nEdited November 17, 2019 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/302404-saruman-hero-and-threat-control/?do=findComment&comment=3830827","commentId":3830827,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1574006456,"content":"What about the quest where you start at 0 threat?

Hopefully you play with loragorn and can pass him over as well. (Not at the same time obviously)"}]}
