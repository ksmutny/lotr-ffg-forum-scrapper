Correct me if I am wrong! I think if they have the license for LOTR they an do any type of game. I know about Games Workshop, but, sadly ,it is not available in my country, while FFG is. Also I want better mechanics, not just some stats and rolling dice... A really miniature game that is also a card game(Like Legends of Signum, on the Kickstarter).\n\nEdited May 10, 2018 by Veve7"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/275650-new-lord-of-the-rings-miniature-card-game/?do=findComment&comment=3326676","commentId":3326676,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1525991344,"content":"I'm pretty sure GW had exclusive rights to LOTR miniature games,  so FFG is actually not permitted to make them"}]}
