In Norway everything imported is custom and tax free if the value of the package is $34,66. So this time no I don't have to pay anything. In DK the upper limit is only $13,68. But in any regards if you don't really know the limit for Uk I'd write to them and ask if they could put the value printed on the package to like $10 or $5. Just to be sure. Also, here in Norway there's this crazy rule that if for say the package has a value of $33,66 and cost $10 to ship, then it's tax free. But if it cost $35 and $10 to ship you pay tax of $45!!! So investigate the rules in Uk :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74304-heirs-of-numenor-shipping-to-stores/?do=findComment&comment=723938","commentId":723938,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1352981542,"content":"cheers thomas- il look into that happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74304-heirs-of-numenor-shipping-to-stores/?do=findComment&comment=723944","commentId":723944,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1352981901,"content":" Happy hunting :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74304-heirs-of-numenor-shipping-to-stores/?do=findComment&comment=723975","commentId":723975,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1352985836,"content":"cordeirooo said:\n\nCJMatos said:\n\n \n\nspalanzani said:\n\n \n\nMy faithful 13th floor has been known to get stuff within a week of the US date (they actually had RtM three working days after its US release, which is still something I look back on fondly), so I'm hoping if the US release is 21st, they'll have it by the end of November.
