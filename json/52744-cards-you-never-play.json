In our play group, the guy who invariably plays tactics never uses thicket of spheres, and I don't think I've ever seen Dark knowledge put into action, I'm sure you each have you own examples.\n\nThe question is, what do you do with these cards? on the one hand, useless cards are useful (!?!) for discarding - Eowyn's effect is the most obvious example, but I'm sure there are others i've momentarily forgotten.\n\nOn the other hand, more cards bulk out the deck. Is it better, to thin out the dead cards, increase the chance of drawing stuff you want, but then face the situation where you want to discard cards to boost Eowyn's willpower, and everyone's saying \"i don't really want to discard, all these cards are really useful.\"\n\nso what do people think? does a good deck need bad cards to work?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52744-cards-you-never-play/?do=findComment&comment=524635","commentId":524635,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1315289671,"content":"Thicket of Spears, Rain of Arrows, Stand Together.

I would rather have good cards that I have to discard than have \"bad\" cards sitting in my hand when I've got no need to discard them. I find that sometimes even good cards just aren't useful in all situations and that can make throwing away a \"good\" card much easier."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52744-cards-you-never-play/?do=findComment&comment=524829","commentId":524829,"userName":"BeeGentle","timestamp":1315322925,"content":"I can see where some cards may be useful when more cards that carry a trait would be useful but there are some that I will most likely never use. The green ally that you can exhaust to draw a card for example. Why? Green has so many card draws and you need beefy allies to block, not 1 HP paper tigers.\n\nI disagree on Stand Together. It costs nothing and can be the difference between a hero getting killed or not.\n\nOne of the most seemingly overplayed cards that I find horrendous is Favor of the Lady. 2 Spirit for 1 WP? Why not just have a better questing hero or Protector of Lorien...or an ally with 1 WP...or....yeah. Not to mention that there's a lot of cards that remove attachments. Blue tends to be such a resource drain that I can't fathom spending 2 resources for that. Just take Eowyn and slap Protector of Lorien or +2 WP stone on here and that should carry you through most quests."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52744-cards-you-never-play/?do=findComment&comment=524953","commentId":524953,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1315339633,"content":"When I saw the title Gandalf's Search and Beorn's Hospitality, I was excited.

For a character like Eowyn who's ALWAYs going to be questing, an extra boost to her willpower is ideal. Also, unlike Celebrian's stone, it's not unique or restricted."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52744-cards-you-never-play/?do=findComment&comment=525195","commentId":525195,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1315394263,"content":"Glaurung said:\n\nlleimmoen said:\n\n \n\nWhen I saw the title Gandalf's Search and Beorn's Hospitality, I was excited.

As it is, I think you can do better with the Daughter (in general) or Selp Preservation (Gloin and such strategies) or even Lore of Imladris which I am not a big fan of. I rarely come to situation that the damage would be spread over all of my heroes."}]}
