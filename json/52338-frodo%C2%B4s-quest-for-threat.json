Fx Chieftain Ufthak with 1 token giving him an attack of 5. Would that attack count as giving him 5 damage and thus raising the players threat by 5 or does it count as him taking his remaining hit points as damage thus raising threat by 1 or 2?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52338-frodo%C2%B4s-quest-for-threat/?do=findComment&comment=521408","commentId":521408,"userName":"evilidler","timestamp":1314602542,"content":" Good question. The text says:\"After Frodo Baggins is damaged, cancel the damage and instead raise your threat by the amount of damage he would have been dealt.\"\n\nIf we take this literally, and look at the example in the box on page 18 of the manual, it would mean the total damage could well go far past the hero's health.\n\n\"[…] the result is the number of damage tokens he must deal to the defender (6). Since the Silverlode Archer only has 1 hit point, it is immediately destroyed.\"\n\nSo \"damage dealt\" seems to be the total attack of the enemy after all modifiers. At least that's how I've been playing it so far."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52338-frodo%C2%B4s-quest-for-threat/?do=findComment&comment=521472","commentId":521472,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1314611538,"content":"Then again there is the hill troll monster which states that any excess damage beyond the characters hit points is dealt as threat instead.\n\nThough this doesn´t specifically exclude that characters can take damage beyond their current hit points it does point in the direction that they do not.\n\nSeems like this would be nice to have clarified, both for the sake of the Frodo hero but also for the sake of future phrasing like: \"Response: prevent 2 points of lifeloss\" (just made that last one up to state an example)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52338-frodo%C2%B4s-quest-for-threat/?do=findComment&comment=521518","commentId":521518,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1314619988,"content":"I disagree.  The wording of the Hill Troll makes it very clear that characters always take the full amount of damage, even if that exceeds their health.  HT reads \"damage that is dealt beyond the remaining hit points of the character damaged in the attack\" (signifying that such damage is possible) is assigned as threat.\n\n \n\nIn the Chieftan Ufthak example, Frodo would take 5 damage, cancel it, and then raise his threat by 5.  If he were defending against a Hill Troll, he would take 6 damage, cancel it, raise his threat by 6, and then since NO damage was dealt beyond Frodo's hit points, the Hill Troll's text wouldn't trigger."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52338-frodo%C2%B4s-quest-for-threat/?do=findComment&comment=521950","commentId":521950,"userName":"Iver2","timestamp":1314697818,"content":"radiskull said:\n\nI disagree.  The wording of the Hill Troll makes it very clear that characters always take the full amount of damage, even if that exceeds their health.  HT reads \"damage that is dealt beyond the remaining hit points of the character damaged in the attack\" (signifying that such damage is possible) is assigned as threat.\n\n \n\nIn the Chieftan Ufthak example, Frodo would take 5 damage, cancel it, and then raise his threat by 5.  If he were defending against a Hill Troll, he would take 6 damage, cancel it, raise his threat by 6, and then since NO damage was dealt beyond Frodo's hit points, the Hill Troll's text wouldn't trigger.\n\n\n\n \n\nStrongly agree. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52338-frodo%C2%B4s-quest-for-threat/?do=findComment&comment=522044","commentId":522044,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1314711945,"content":"I agree with radiskull as well.
