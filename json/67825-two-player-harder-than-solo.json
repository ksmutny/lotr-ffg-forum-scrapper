However, the one deck has to be more flexible whereas in 2 player game, each deck can have a more specific function.\n\nOveall, I'd say as I've said before, it really depends on a scenario."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67825-two-player-harder-than-solo/?do=findComment&comment=661704","commentId":661704,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1342852557,"content":"depends on how good the quest scales- take return to mirkwood- crazy hard solo, but ive just got the long dark and won it 3 times on the go solo…really easy quest solo…so it all depends on the quest i guess"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67825-two-player-harder-than-solo/?do=findComment&comment=661707","commentId":661707,"userName":"Ranger of the Force","timestamp":1342853573,"content":"Budgernaut said:\n\n I think you're spot on in saying that solo is easier because that is what you're used too.

I added Bofur into my deck for the game too. He is pretty nice when Dain is in play!\n\nI still felt much more suspense when pulling the cards from the encounter deck. I think it is because as a solo player, you only have one possible enemy, location, or treachery to counter. In two-player, you could have two awful treacheries and they happen to both players.\n\nI don't know.

When you build a duo or etc. multiplayer deck - you can focus on something, being sure that other playr(s) got covered up the other aspects."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/67825-two-player-harder-than-solo/?do=findComment&comment=661852","commentId":661852,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1342889633,"content":" Yes, but not only do the expansions change thing up a bit - with a significantly different scaling (mostly) but also the limited card pool of the core set is the problem.

And it may be because I play more coop than solo, just maybe. There are not many of these but I would say at least Hunt and Massing I have done way better against solo. But as you said, these, especially Massing, get really crazy with four players. The difference between one and two is still not just marginal, in my opinion."}]}
