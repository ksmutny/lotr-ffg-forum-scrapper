In battle of five armies we almost do the same thing\n\nRescue: I don't remember mount gram being that hard. Not in his normal version though. I think escape from dol guldur is my best experience of being captured. Some rescue quest (encounter at amon din, dongeon of cirith ungol) don't fit well in this category to me."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271645-get-your-favorite-quest-type-x-poll-here/?do=findComment&comment=3251605","commentId":3251605,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1521214458,"content":"By \"hardest,\" I meant that this was the most difficult choice to make.  The Mount Gram quest itself is on the easy side."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271645-get-your-favorite-quest-type-x-poll-here/?do=findComment&comment=3257478","commentId":3257478,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1521728938,"content":"Here are some results:\n\nimage.png.c9c22a95f998032743396150f575e4d6.png [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_03/image.png.c9c22a95f998032743396150f575e4d6.png]\n\nimage.png.27c76f8bd3fe769b5187a7b13d56f7ef.png [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_03/image.png.27c76f8bd3fe769b5187a7b13d56f7ef.png]\n\nimage.png.91a3d587f53d77f0587089630ca36e76.png [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_03/image.png.91a3d587f53d77f0587089630ca36e76.png]\n\nimage.png.8e8c7152d7ab47a14d7f91b1fcc88670.png [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_03/image.png.8e8c7152d7ab47a14d7f91b1fcc88670.png] \n\nThat blue response there (21.9%) is actually The Ruins of Belegost, not shown in the key (didn't fit).\n\nimage.png.1a0d7e754af8ec69782f2ab52c7ca725.png [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/monthly_2018_03/image.png.1a0d7e754af8ec69782f2ab52c7ca725.png]\n\nThe 21.2% blue response is Massing.  The smaller blue response is A Storm on Cobas Haven (not shown in key).\n\n \n\nEdited March 22, 2018 by GrandSpleen"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271645-get-your-favorite-quest-type-x-poll-here/?do=findComment&comment=3257913","commentId":3257913,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1521748352,"content":"All the top answer are either the quest I select or the one I hate the most in the category ^^\n\nEdited March 22, 2018 by Rouxxor"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/271645-get-your-favorite-quest-type-x-poll-here/?do=findComment&comment=3258051","commentId":3258051,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1521755499,"content":"Helm's Deep and Pelennor Fields battle to a tie!
