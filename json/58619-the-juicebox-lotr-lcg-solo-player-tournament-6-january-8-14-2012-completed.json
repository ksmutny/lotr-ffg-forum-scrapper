This week’s tournament takes us past the half way mark in a series of tournaments exploring the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle. The idea behind this tournament is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements in a Solo Player Tournament. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week.) See also, The juicebox LOTR LCG Top Ten Hall of Fame [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=582954].\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. In the mean time, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104&efpag=0].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Solo Player Tournament!\n\nSolo Player Tournament #6:\n\nQuest: The Hills of Emyn Muil\nDeck Parameters: 1-3 Core Sets + HfG, CotC, JtR, & HoEM Adventure Packs\nNumber of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. muemakan ~ 39 (Legolas, Beravor, Denethor)\n2.

Unfortunately that took six more turns as my heroes and allies battled Dol Guldur Orcs, Ufthak, and hosts of Crows.\n\nDenethor would definitely be needed for a good score on this quest, I think. Hopefully I will find the time to improve on this one...\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=578556","commentId":578556,"userName":"Chac2","timestamp":1326375780,"content":"Hi,\n\n \n\nMy best score at the moment for this quest is 52\n\n \n\nHeroes : Eowyn, Dunhere, Theodred (3 core set + all the AP)\n\n \n\nRound markers : 5 (50)\n\nFinal threat : 19\n\nWounds : 4\n\nVictory points : 21\n\n \n\nTotal : 52\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58619-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-solo-player-tournament-6-january-8-14-2012-completed/?do=findComment&comment=578683","commentId":578683,"userName":"p_toler","timestamp":1326391114,"content":"This time a put an UC on Denethor, which helped a lot.

However I don't think that would have improved my score since I hadn't been able to deal properly with my threat by then. In turn seven I once again thought I would be able to end the game since I could play two RF, but I suddenly realized that I couldn't use their ability to explore the location that was drawn as an encounter because Rauros Falls was active. However going yet another turn actually gained me another few points since I was able to lower my threat from 10 to 0 AND score another location.\n\nI must say I really liked this scenario (I know that many others don't).
