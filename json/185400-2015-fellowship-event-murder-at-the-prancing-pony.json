I find it great to finally have a new quest take place in a settled, civilised place and Bree is pretty cool for that. Leaves plenty of room for imagination. I admit that I also thought about Game of Thrones when I saw the villains but you know what, it's hardly more of a stretch than the ones in Steward's Fear, and in fact the whole plot about Faramir being abducted to Minas Morgul is more of a canon break IMO. You are right in that they took great liberties with these unique enemies, but to me their names and appearances really match the more rural village and more light hearted setting. Maybe if this was the first or second POD quest I would have been more shocked, but after all the FFG-invented characters and villains and the whole focus on story over the years this kind of creativity is to be expected.

But it doesn't bother me too much (in fact I'm super excited for this one), because to me the POD quests in particular are a chance for the designers to go nuts and experiment with something off the wall. I have wanted to see something along the lines of a murder mystery in card form for a long time (I once suggested a Sherlock Holmes LCG), and I'm so interested to see how they are going to pull it off. Is it a seamless fit with Tolkien? No. Do I care all that much? Not really. Especially since the attention to lore is so good in general. This game to me is a chance to play in Tolkien's world and gosh darn it, I want to play whodunnit with Barliman Butterbur!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185400-2015-fellowship-event-murder-at-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=1741190","commentId":1741190,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1439870217,"content":"Hmmmm Stewards Fear takes influence directly from conflicts Gondor had in the past with Black Numenorians, Corsairs of Umber and traitorous rulers. Daughter of Beruthial could easily be a descendant of Queen Beruthial who was a traitorous ruler of Gondor (well wife of a ruler) just like the Hand of Castimir could be a descendant of Castamir (who created the Corsairs of Umbar) or could just be a general or spy from Umbar who we know are fierce enemies of Gondor. Lastly the \"Bane of Telemnar\" refers to a great king who died when the great plague struck. The plague was apparently \"brought by an evil wind from the east\" and many theorize that Sauron himself inflicted it upon Middle Earth. If this is the case Telemnars Bane is likely some sort of agent of Sauron reminiscent or related to the days of the great plague. Perhaps he is even there to start a new plague or sickness starting in Minas Tirith? This sounds like something Sauron would attempt if possible for sure. Perhaps the Hand of Castimir or Daughter of Beruthial think that by helping Sauron/Alcaron out they will be given great positions of power being distant descendants of rulers.

Last year's Fellowship Event was a fantastic experience. Players got to meet other players, worked together to overcome (or not) an engaging and difficult quest in Fog on the Barrow Downs, and received some great LOTR stuff in the quest, the alt-art hero card, and the playmat. I do hope as many 2015 Fellowship Events can be arranged as possible, as it's a truly enjoyable event for our community.\n\n \n\nInterested in this quest, as it looks unusual for an LOTR scenario. I haven't really warmed up to the names of the suspects we see in the preview article (to me they don't seem \"Tolkienish\" enough), but I'm open to trying something a little different. The investigation mechanic sounds interesting, as it suggests that the players may actually have to visit various locations in order to figure out who the criminal is. In most quests, we usually just try to blow through or avoid locations, so the notion of purposefully going to them and possibly even staying at them sounds intriguing to me. I just played \"The Uruk-Hai\" last night again and really enjoyed many of the locations in that scenario that had the drawback/benefit combination, so I'm hoping we get something like that in this scenario.\n\nEdited August 18, 2015 by RobOz"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/185400-2015-fellowship-event-murder-at-the-prancing-pony/?do=findComment&comment=1742530","commentId":1742530,"userName":"Kentares","timestamp":1439919577,"content":"> Sounds like Game of Thrones…..
