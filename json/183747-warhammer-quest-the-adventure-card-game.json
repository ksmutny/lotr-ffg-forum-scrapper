Seeing as there already is a 40k I dont see the need (other than GW cash-cow).\n\nId rather they left WFB as it was, even if they wound down production amounts and stopped expansions (should have stopped rule revising years ago anyway).\n\nDont like the idea of it, but then I have the choice not to buy. So for me WFB seems to have ended with 8th Ed, drawn a line under. I have my books and armies so can always play it :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183747-warhammer-quest-the-adventure-card-game/?do=findComment&comment=1716957","commentId":1716957,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1438574761,"content":"I wouldn't think of this game as a competitor to LOTR.
