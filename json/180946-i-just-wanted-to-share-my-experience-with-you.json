So with the Troll and the rotating Banks I knew how much to quest each round, and I could slowly build my team. In the end I only encountered one Hill Troll, one Dol Guldur Orcs and some treachery's that most of the time didn't have any big impact.\n\n \n\nSo, after such an easy win I immediately played again. A game I shall remember.. \n\nWithin only a couple of rounds I had one Hill Troll, two Dol Guldur Beastmasters and a Goblin Sniper, waiting for me in the staging area. I felt hopeless, considered to just surrender and start a new game, but I didn't. \n\nAfter luring these foul beasts out one at a time, with some help from Gandalf, I managed to kill them all.  :ph34r: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_ph34r.png]\n\nIn the second stage I even encountered another another Hill Troll, but this one was no match for my marching army and within three rounds after completing the first stage I won the game.\n\n \n\nAnd it felt awesome, so I wanted to share this experience!  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180946-i-just-wanted-to-share-my-experience-with-you/?do=findComment&comment=1668212","commentId":1668212,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1434996564,"content":"Awesome!\n\nExcellent wins well done and so glad you enjoyed :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nGreat stuff!\n\nMyself I struggled at Anduin for quite some time, though I do love its variety of thematic stages to the quest.\n\nYay!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180946-i-just-wanted-to-share-my-experience-with-you/?do=findComment&comment=1668291","commentId":1668291,"userName":"Virani","timestamp":1434999553,"content":"Yes, before today I managed to win this scenario only once, so today was a good day.\n\nThink I'll start with the quests from the expansions now. \n\n \n\nAnd I love how every card in this game feels so thematic and true to character.\n\nIt even encourages me to build thematic decks, which I love that it is even viable to try. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180946-i-just-wanted-to-share-my-experience-with-you/?do=findComment&comment=1668328","commentId":1668328,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1435000579,"content":"I still feel accomplished whenever I beat JDTA, even in these days.

As a new player myself Journey Along the Anduin is the quest I play most frequently, and I always get lulled into a false sense of my own invincibility whenever I have an easy win.
