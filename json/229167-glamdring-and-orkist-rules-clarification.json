Legolas wording was diffrent and it was about participating in an attack that destroys the enemy, here the character needs to destroy the enemy alone, am i right?\n\n \n\n2) How does Glamdring works with Sting on Bilbo Baggins? If I exhaust Bilbo to defend, use Sting ability and kill the enemy, does the Glamdring triggers too?\n\n \n\nThanks in advance,\n\nZura"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229167-glamdring-and-orkist-rules-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=2396676","commentId":2396676,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1472836070,"content":"1) No, the attached character just needs to be participating.\n\n2) Glamdring wouldn't trigger because Bilbo's not destroying an enemy- Sting's effect is."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/229167-glamdring-and-orkist-rules-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=2396801","commentId":2396801,"userName":"Zura","timestamp":1472838862,"content":"Thank you a lot.
