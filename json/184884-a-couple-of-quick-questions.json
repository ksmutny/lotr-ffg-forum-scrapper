So if I use Asfaloth to explore a location, it is considered explored and all effects that trigger after being explored, do so normally. My fellow players insisted that effects that trigger on the location being explored activate only if it is an active location (they claimed that locations in the staging area with enough progress are considered discarded, not explored)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184884-a-couple-of-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1762451","commentId":1762451,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1440860342,"content":"You're correct, a location is considered 'explored' once it has progress equal to its quest points (unless some other effect prevents it from leaving play).  It doesn't need to be the active location."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/184884-a-couple-of-quick-questions/?do=findComment&comment=1763021","commentId":1763021,"userName":"FetaCheese","timestamp":1440888412,"content":"Thank you. "}]}
