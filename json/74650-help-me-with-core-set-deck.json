I would like you to give me some deck-building advice and tips in order to help me beat the quest in solo mode. I would really appreaciate of you could submit your deck proposals using the cards ONLY from one core set.\n\n \n\nThank you so much in advance!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74650-help-me-with-core-set-deck/?do=findComment&comment=726873","commentId":726873,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1353600005,"content":"hey\n\nwelcome\n\nfirstly i would recommend searching (on the web..not the site) for a thread called 'drowning on the anduin' which deals with pretty much the same as you are asking\n\nalso, im not sure if you have, but try putting a thread in the deck building sub catagory, you may get some replies before the thread gets buried\n\nwhat heros are you trying? key to winning this quest is low threat until you can deal with the troll, so pack some galadrims greetings (spirit) and gandalf (neutral) with sneak attack (leadership) all to lower threat\n\nthen you can deal with the troll when some allies are in play. you can either forest snare it, or let an ally take a hit, or feint it. either way absorb 1 attack at most then launch an all out assault with your attackers. you want to take it down as fast as possible\n\n2 heros are really good in anduin, dunhere for striking in the staging area, and thalin to deal with the crows before they surge\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74650-help-me-with-core-set-deck/?do=findComment&comment=726905","commentId":726905,"userName":"cordeirooo","timestamp":1353608967,"content":"Check this out [http://boardgamegeek.com/thread/724807/spirittactics-deck-for-passage-through-mirkwood]. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74650-help-me-with-core-set-deck/?do=findComment&comment=727098","commentId":727098,"userName":"Riuka","timestamp":1353672788,"content":" Thanks a lot guys!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74650-help-me-with-core-set-deck/?do=findComment&comment=728751","commentId":728751,"userName":"sammann11","timestamp":1354140729,"content":"I agree with rich sabre that \"drowningon the anduin\" is a good thread to go over. He pointed me to it and it helped big time.\n\nLike you, I'mbuying (and playing) the sets/packs in order.\n\nI just beat that quest earlier tonight playing \"2-handed\" with a tactics deck and the spirit deck (each deck with 2 Gandalfs). I use the spirit guys to quest, tactics to fight. If you can get Citadel plate on Gimli, have him absorb the damage, then have him hit back big the next turn. \n\nI have found that for this quest I've had good luck doing this, not mixing spheres. While this is not a viable option for some quests, it seems to work for \"journey down..\"\n\nAs for \"Esape..\", well. The one time I beat it I played \"4-handed\" using all four decks, no mixed shepes. This gives you all the heros (minus the captive) as options. It was still tough, and demanded a decent amount of table space and brain power, but it is do-able.\n\nGood luck! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74650-help-me-with-core-set-deck/?do=findComment&comment=728834","commentId":728834,"userName":"Captain Poe","timestamp":1354180355,"content":"I was able to beat the anduin with the premade spirit deck. A modification of it should do the job.\n\n \n\nThe third quest is basically unbeatable unless you invest heavily in expansions. I thought that was BS, but after multiple losses, solo and 2 player, i gave up. I think It took me something like 40 tries to finally get through it. It makes anduin look like a cake walk."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74650-help-me-with-core-set-deck/?do=findComment&comment=731831","commentId":731831,"userName":"jrd","timestamp":1355043347,"content":"There's been a lot of discussion about beating Journey down the Anduin on Boardgamegeek - have a look through the 'Sessions' section pf http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77423/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game [http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/77423/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-card-game] and you'll find a lot of helpful threads.\n\nEscape from Dol Guldur can be beaten with two players with the core set, but it's a tough challenge and you'll want to build your own decks to have the best chance. It's extremely hard to beat Dol Guldur with only one player, even with all the cards from the expansion sets. Basically, with only a core set, you will only beat this one solo with a lot of luck."}]}
