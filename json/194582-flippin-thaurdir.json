I stop.\n\n \n\nBecause stage 1B says:\n\n \n\nForced: If there are 3 shadow cards dealt to Thaurdir, flip him.\n\n \n\nThis being a forced effect, I should resolve it immediately, yes? But then Champion Thaurdir is no longer in play... so does the attack I was about to resolve still happen?\n\n \n\nAlso, having flipped him again, Captain Thaurdir's Forced effect should trigger, dealing 1 shadow card to every enemy in play, including Thaurdir himself. If I haven't resolved Champion Thaurdir's attack yet (if I should at all), this gives him 4 shadow cards. As harkened in another active thread, does him having *4* shadow cards re-trigger stage 1B's Forced effect (despite 4!=3)?\n\n \n\nI suppose if it does re-trigger, I'd have to flip Thaurdir back to Champion and trigger his Forced effect, which would give him an immediate attack. Is this a SECOND immediate attack? Even if it's just the first, don't I have to deal him another shadow card (now 5!), which may then re-re-trigger stage 1B's flipping effect? How many flips before I flip the table? And if flipping the table flips Thaurdir, how many shadow cards should I deal him?

Going into the combat phase, he is on his Captain side and has 2 shadow cards. Then one other enemy's attack causes Thaurdir to be flipped. Thaurdir flips to his Champion side, causing an immediate attack per the Champion's Forced effect. He is dealt 1 shadow card to initiate the attack. Now Thaurdir has 3 cards, so he flips again before the attack is resolved. He is Captain side up now, so his Forced effect deals a shadow card to every enemy in play. Thaurdir just got another card, so now he has 4 and, if (A) above it he correct interpretation, he will flip again and queue up a 2nd immediate attack, which will deal him another shadow card to begin that attack (and some of these shadow cards could flip him again, and so on). SO.... we're flipping out! Thanks for your help as always!!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194582-flippin-thaurdir/?do=findComment&comment=1914852","commentId":1914852,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1449004830,"content":"Welp, he certainly answered the question!\n\nI generally agree, by the way, that Champion Thaurdir's attack should finish even if he's flipped before it has completed resolving. I still have this vague feeling that the whole flipping business is a little tricky to reconcile with various issues with text on out-of-play cards, but I guess it's clear enough in this particular case."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194582-flippin-thaurdir/?do=findComment&comment=1914924","commentId":1914924,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1449007544,"content":"It seems to be that if the card has the same title after you flip it, it is not considered to have left play.  At least, that's the feeling I get."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/194582-flippin-thaurdir/?do=findComment&comment=1950321","commentId":1950321,"userName":"Sin21","timestamp":1450795995,"content":"It is the same Card after all and it never left the staging area ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]"}]}
