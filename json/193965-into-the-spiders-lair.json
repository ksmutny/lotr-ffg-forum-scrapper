If a player card with Setup instructions is in a player’s deck at the beginning of a game, that player searches his deck for that card and follows its instructions before drawing his first hand. Similarly, if an encounter card with Setup is in the encounter deck at the beginning of a game, search the encounter deck for that card and follow its instructions before resolving the Setup instructions on the quest.\"\n\n \n\nThe underlined text might make you think a card like Searching Eye should go into your deck before you draw your starting hand.  But it's not a player card, it's an encounter card, so this text is irrelevant.  Searching Eye has no Setup instructions on itself, so the part about encounter cards in the instructions above also does not apply.  Instead, we have Setup instructions on the campaign card.  They say: \n\n \n\n\"You are playing campaign mode. Setup: Each player shuffles 1 copy of The Searching Eye into his deck.\"\n\n \n\nCampaign Setup instructions are followed either just before or just after you follow the Setup instructions on the quest card (not sure which).  In either case, that comes after you draw your starting hand, so you won't be shuffling Searching Eyes into your deck until step 7 of setup from the core rules (drawing your starting hand is step 5).\n\n \n\nIf you earn the burden at the end of the scenario, then in subsequent scenarios that \"earned\" text you quoted would apply."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193965-into-the-spiders-lair/?do=findComment&comment=1904448","commentId":1904448,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1448278427,"content":"May I?\n\n \n\nI asked Caleb about Poisonous Councils a while ago, and here is the answer he gave me:\n\n \n\n> When playing campaign mode, boons that you have earned are considered part of your deck before you even set up the game. So it is possible to draw boons in your opening hand.\n> Burden cards with both encounter and player card backs are considered part of the encounter deck and do not get shuffled in until you build the encounter deck (which comes after building your player deck and choosing your heroes).

I asked Matt Newman whether this support would be worded such that it supports decks with two regular heroes and one saga hero. He said no, since they \"tend to keep certain saga considerations separate when making cards for the cycle\" (partly to avoid confusing players who haven't played the saga expansions), but he also said that I had his blessing to play those upcoming cards as though they said \"if you control 2 or fewer non-Baggins, non-Fellowship heroes.\" (By the same logic, you could play Strength of Arms in a mono-Leadership deck if you controlled a saga hero.)\n\nEdited December 13, 2015 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/193965-into-the-spiders-lair/?do=findComment&comment=1932238","commentId":1932238,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1449967869,"content":"The saga stage that still haunts me is the seventh, Hunting the Uruk Hai.

It's easier to think of her as helping from afar. Also, Frodo and Sam need another hero, and (aside from Journey to the Cross-roads) she's the most thematic option, even in Mordor (where Sam asks her for light and water, and gets them). Aside from saga boxes 4 and 6, I'd prefer to avoid heroes that aren't physically present.\n\n \n\nThe other issue with playing The Uruk-Hai two-handed is that I'm trying to minimize hero swaps for campaign mode. I might house rule a thematic swap or two with no threat increase, but I'd like to limit that as much as possible. By playing Breaking of the Fellowship two-handed and The Uruk-Hai solo, I can leave out Sam without a threat increase. It's also thematically nice to have the three hunters stick together in solo, rather than having Fellowship Aragorn switching between the hunters deck (which will have Rohan allies anyways) and the Éomer deck. The solo hunters deck is just missing a new Legolas/Gimli hero (hopefully Spirit, although Leadership would allow for Celebrian's Stone) and ally Éomer.\n\n \n\nFor Journey to the Cross-roads, I might play it solo and house-rule a no-threat swap from Galadriel to Lore Faramir and Damrod. I have a deck (which might need a bit more support) that runs Ambush, Ithilien Pit, Poisoned Stakes, Ranger Bow (for Ithilien allies), and Forest Patrol. It uses Song of Battle and A Good Harvest to get access to Great Yew Bow and Dagger of Westernesse.

The only one I've managed to beat so far is Shelob's Lair, which is admitedly a fun scenario, maybe my favorite one from this expansion.\n\n \n\nHave you tried a Straight Shot, O Elbereth Gilthonial, or Helm Helm strategy against the Oliphaunts? It's a fun way to deal with them aside from loading up a strong hero with readying effects.
