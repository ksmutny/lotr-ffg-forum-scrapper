So, are we supposed to also remove a copy of Hill Troll? Which is it? Help!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84789-easy-mode-down-the-anduin-a-contradiction/?do=findComment&comment=801904","commentId":801904,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1370499720,"content":"The cards to remove are listed by Encounter set, rather than by deck.\n\nYou remove 1xMassing at Night and 2xGladden Fields from the Journey Down the Anduin SET.\n\nBut, as listed, you also remove 1xHill Troll (and 1xMarsh Adder + 2xDespair) from the Wilderlands encounter set, which is used for the Anduin QUEST.\n\nSo there's no problem!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/84789-easy-mode-down-the-anduin-a-contradiction/?do=findComment&comment=802289","commentId":802289,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1370641743,"content":"Oh!
