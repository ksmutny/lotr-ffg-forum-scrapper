Looks like the player deck is your  dwindling resources/supplies. The encounter deck is going to make you discard cards like crazy. The quest cards do this based on side quests in play. I haven't looked at any other encounter cards yet. \n\nI'm guessing a dwarven deck that triggers off discarding cards would work well here, but not the dwarven tropes that actually do the discarding. \n\nDiscard pile cards would shine such as Spirit ally Glorfindel. Stand and fight, reforged, Caldara Galadhrim Weaver, knight of Belfalas, Elven-light, Will of the West. Dwarven Tomb. (A lot of Spirit cards) \n\nCards that reorder the top of the deck. Might be useful to make sure you only draw what's essential. Cards that search and pull. So many cards across all spheres. \n\nAnd of course side quest loving cards like East Road Ranger, Thallion, legacy blade etc. \n\nSo, I think I might build a Spirit Dwarven Deck. \n\nBefore I dive in what are your thoughts about this quest? \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3931985","commentId":3931985,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1588099940,"content":"> 48 minutes ago, asgardianphil said:\n> \n> I'm guessing a dwarven deck that triggers off discarding cards would work well here, but not the dwarven tropes that actually do the discarding. \n\nDwarven Pipe will be super useful in this quest and also Ever My Heart Rises would probably shine.\n\nDwarves seems indeed the way, but not the mining ones.

I'm thinking I now need to prevent these locations from hurting the board state so that I can get the side quests even quicker. It's taking all game just to clear 1."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3938836","commentId":3938836,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1589348703,"content":"I just beat it twice with this deck: https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/169183 [https://ringsdb.com/deck/view/169183]\n\nOriginally, I was thinking Tactics Theoden + Tactics Eowyn to kill the Torech Gorgor Patrol on the first turn (with Inner Strength on Beregond, you can defend with impunity, and so all you need is a Feint or a chump blocker for the second attack). But I couldn't muster enough willpower to blow through the quest fast enough, so I decided to go for Spirit Eowyn for the sphere balance. I took inspiration from a Seastan deck with the same hero lineup, because it can get Tactics Theoden up to 6 attack on the first turn with Herugrim, which can be very valuable, and just added a few more questing allies and some stuff to interact with the discard mechanic of the quest.\n\nI left it at 56 cards in hopes of seeding the discard pile with good cards for Stand and Fight or Reforged (or getting Hidden Cache/Ered Luin Miner into play) before the game even started, but you could pretty easily cut it down to 50 (I'd probably cut Open the Armory - it's normally an essential card for this kind of deck, but card draw can be a liability in this quest - and Hidden Cache - the extra resources are useful for getting set up but become pointless in the late game).\n\nIt's not a guaranteed win, to be sure. I lost once on the last turn of the game. Questing for 19 against 0 threat in staging, and only needed to make progress. Then Burning Reek came out and I only had 6 cards left in the deck but 13 characters out. I lost a couple other times, less memorably - this quest is unforgiving. But this deck can do it. The first time I won, I got out 2 Ered Luin Miners and a Hidden Cache in the opening discard (8 cards), and I had 2 Ethir Swordsmen in the opening hand. That 4 willpower let me clear the opening side quest (can't remember what it was), and it was pretty smooth sailing after that. The second quest was much harder-fought. At one point, I ended up with all 3 Patrols out and I couldn't find Herugrim, Veteran Axehands, or Stand and Fight to pull the ones out of my discard pile. I didn't discard an Ered Luin Miner until the late game, and I ended up playing 2 from my hand just to play the Dwarf Pipes on them. But I consistently handled willpower, and I eventually whittled down the Patrols. (I finally did find Herugrim with an Open the Armory). The win took 14 rounds, and I only had 5 cards left, so Burning Reek or Lost in the Dark would have sunk me if it came out.\n\nThe priority of the deck is getting out willpower - I mulliganned for Ethir Swordsmen or Galadriel's Handmaidens. Both wins, I had 2 or more willpower allies in hand on turn 1. Second priority is readying on Beregond - that's the guaranteed way to engage a patrol, and you can afford to let it sit there for a while, even if you get a second enemy. Third priority is Herugrim on Theoden or - failing that - Veteran Axehands/Ered Luin Miners. On multiple occasions, I actually left the Ethir Swordsmen ready so they could contribute their attack to kill a patrol. Reforged gets you Dwarf Pipes out of the discard pile, Stand and Fight gets you whatever you need. I always quest with Theoden turn 1 (and often 2 and 3 as well) because I found clearing the side quests to be the most important thing.\n\nI think there might be a variant of this that uses a 3-attack Spirit hero (Lanwyn or Idraen) and Tactics Eowyn to kill the Patrol turn 1 and still have the willpower mustering you need. Perhaps it uses Eowyn + herugrim as a primary attacker?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3938850","commentId":3938850,"userName":"asgardianphil","timestamp":1589355194,"content":"The beacons are lit... \n\nBeregond calls for aid\n\n...

(You couldn't retrieve a Master card from the discard pile, because the Ring only says to search your deck, but Setup text that doesn't directly reference your deck should be fine.)\n\nAlso - congrats!

(Come to think of it no card was nice in that encounter deck, even the Spawn of Shelobs were nasty due to their surge.)\n\nI think I would have tried Hunting Party but by game 16 I realised that removing it with Great Hunt hadn't worked for me, trying to engage and Forrest Snare (without a fighting deck) hadn't really worked either. Attacking it with direct damage also hadn't worked. All mainly because of the set up required to get those cards in play from a fast shrinking player deck. Also they discard the target and it will be shuffled back into the encounter deck when stage 1 advances leaving 2 patrols to still be drawn.\n\nI came to the conclusion that the best way to deal with the starting Patrol is with a deck that can engage the Patrol very early and clobber it or just keep it engaged with defending or Reforged Forrest Snare (reforged is better as you can place it before it attacks) so basically Beregond with Inner Strength can defend from turn 1. It's just the immediate attack for engaging you need to handle so Cram, Unexpected Courage, Armoured Destrier and Lembas Bread or any chump. However there are some nasty chumping countermeasures in the encounter deck. \n\n \n\nThe trouble I had with Beregond was his 0 will power. He needed to double as a quester. I think this is why Dain and Aragorn did what Beregond couldn't. Dain boosted all the dwarves and defended too. Aragorn was able to ready from turn 1. I also needed dwarves out from turn 1 for the pipes incase I drew one, so that's the only reason why I used 2 dwarf heroes. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3943152","commentId":3943152,"userName":"asgardianphil","timestamp":1590166593,"content":"I don't have the next two quest packs yet so I might just build a Hunting Party deck and give it a try.

Win the game using Hunting Party. \n\nI've built a deck however it's proved quite difficult. There are only 8 scout heroes in the game and only 1 in Leadership which is in sphere for Hunting Party. Obviously the scout trait doesn't need to be in leadership but it's still slim pickings throughout the spheres. \n\nFearless scout attachment could be used or any number of allys but I really want to be able to use the hunting party turn 1 if I can and I don't want to rely on other set up cards that could end up being discarded. Fearless scout is Spirit sphere and so are the Dwarf pipes and recurring cards so Spirit is needed and Leadership for the hunting party. Dwarves are needed from turn 1 and I need two spirit heroes to be able to play unexpected Courages and Handmaidens etc without needing any resource smoothing or acceleration. \n\nSo I  came up with Gimli and Legolas duo and ended up with Dain spirit over Óin or Dwalin in spirit. Dain leadership was a good choice but I need 2 spirit heroes otherwise I need other cards to grant spirit. Gimli is needed to defend to ready Legolas and he's not going to be good enough as he has a poor defense and has to spend a resource. However he can pay for Elvenking to go on Legolas and the Galadhrim Weaver will be the target of that combo to readyblegolas and recur a card. \n\nThere's still too much to pack into this deck and so it's lacking any healing or threat reduction at the moment but that may come when I tweak it. \n\n \n\nEdited May 25 by asgardianphil\nDwalin not Gloin in spirit"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308032-beating-under-the-ash-mountains/?do=findComment&comment=3944025","commentId":3944025,"userName":"asgardianphil","timestamp":1590371817,"content":"Game #18\n\n50 cards \n\nHeroes: Dain Ironfoot, Legolas (both spirit) and Gimli (leadership)\n\nThreat 31\n\nDraws: Dwarf Pipe, Reforged, Thrór's Key, Dwarven Tomb, Bilbo and Galadhrim Weaver.\n\nOk so this is a great starting hand.
