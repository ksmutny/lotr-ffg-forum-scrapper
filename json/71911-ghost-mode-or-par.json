I looked around the LOG but that only compared my scores to friends, not the community as a whole.\n\nWhat I was hoping to find was an 'official' Fantasy flight 'bar' for more scores especially under the newer scoring rules. \n\nI understand that the difficulty can vary wildly on certain quests as well as victory points.  but if there was a place that held 'said' scores that I could try and beat. Basically I'm looking for whatever the 'par' for the course may be and see how well I could swing it. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71911-ghost-mode-or-par/?do=findComment&comment=701935","commentId":701935,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1348837511,"content":"you could try the quest log?\n\ngo on more- lotr quest log\n\nrich"}]}
