Most of the locations have victory points. The first stage is simply a \"setup\" stage and then players move to a random stage 2 (of which there are 4). Players keep going from one random stage 2 to the next at the end of each round, until they have accumulated 5 times the number of players worth of victory points (from locations) in the victory display. Once this happens, the players instead move to stage 3 at the end of the round. There are some enemies, and they can be dangerous if you don't plan carefully, or get caught over-questing. The worst enemy makes an immediate attack from the staging area at strength 4 against the first player, whenever the active location is explored.\n\n \n\nMany of the locations have terrible passive effects that apply while they are in play: e.g. players cannot heal, players can only play 1 card from their hand each round, progress must be placed on this location before the current quest. There is also a location with a forced effect that makes a player raise their threat by X when optionally engaging an enemy (X is the enemy's Attack). This made it harder for the combat-focused decks to help the quest-focused decks. Sentinel on Elrohir was very helpful (Elven Mail is amazing). I even managed almost the entire game without a copy of Steward of Gondor, so I had Errand-riders frantically transferring my other resources so that he could defend multiple attacks.\n\n \n\nEach stage 2 does something different, and one of them removes a location from the victory display, which could make this quest almost impossible solo (or without serious location-control). They all have a passive that triggers if there are less than X locations in the staging area at the beginning of the round, you have to add locations until you have X. (X = # of players). For us, in a three player game we almost always had at least 3 locations in play. This is why Greyflood, Northern Tracker, and especially Asfaloth were so important. No surprise, Idraen is beyond amazing in this scenario. Also Elf-stone and Ancient Mathom are highly recommended.\n\n \n\nThe last stage is no joke. First you add Old Man Willow and Withywindle to the staging area, then you reveal number of players - 1 cards from the encounter deck. Old Man is indestructible, immune and cannot leave the stage area. He attacks each player for 5 each round and raises the threat of the defending player by removing more locations from the victory display. When we beat it, I spent my precious Leadership resources to play Faramir and everyone quested with every single character they had to clear the Withywindle (which must be explored to win) and put the 18 progress on the 3B. My threat and Ian's were both at 47 and Matt H's threat was around 43. Ian and I would have likely died that round to threat increase, not to mention the attacks of multiple enemies. It was a thrilling, \"by the skin of our teeth\" type of victory. The Old Forest is beatable, and had we all built specifically for it, or had a drawn a Steward earlier, we probably could have done better. Still, I suspect that players who go into it blind with decks that lack a strong mix of location-control, questing and combat will be very frustrated.\n\n \n\nSome of the treacheries are basically must-cancel in multiplayer. The worst was probably \"Falling Branches\": Each player removes a character they control from the quest. If the chosen character is a hero, deal 2 damage to it, 3 damage instead if it is an ally. Absolutely brutal in the early game when the risk of location lock is looming. It also totally throws off your willpower calculations. Eowyn and Protector of Lorien are really helpful as well, since it helps to be able to control your progress down to the point. Good old Bombadil will show up from time to time, great stats and helps with the quest, though he goes away at the end of the round. Sadly, we lost him as a shadow card a couple times in the game that we won - he certainly would have made combat less dangerous, especially in the later rounds. Anyway, the fact that it is challenging, and thematic, and part of the Saga, makes it one of my new favorites.\n\nEdited August 23, 2014 by danpoage"}]}
