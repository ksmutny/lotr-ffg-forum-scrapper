Is this possible?\n\nThanks folks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95605-weather-hills/?do=findComment&comment=937089","commentId":937089,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1387795590,"content":"I think: with trhor's map, you can travel some times. First, normal travel, and after, you use thror's map to change location. So you can facedown under it several enemies. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png] .\n\nNow, i think: if you chose the nazguls to face down them..., are they also considered out of play? Yes! Can you win the quest with nazgul facedown in Weather Hills? It seems good\n\nEdited December 23, 2013 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95605-weather-hills/?do=findComment&comment=937217","commentId":937217,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1387814824,"content":"You would have to remove the wounds from the card, and it then goes out of play (so yeah, it can help you get Nazguls out of play for the victory condition). Â And as Mndela mentioned, you have the potential to travel there multiple times over successive rounds via card effects like West Road Traveler and Thror's Map."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/95605-weather-hills/?do=findComment&comment=937358","commentId":937358,"userName":"Migwald","timestamp":1387824970,"content":"Thanks for the clarification folks"}]}
