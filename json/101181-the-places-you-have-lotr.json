However, only with our old Decipher LOTRCCGBRB cards, feels like too many pieces for the LCG... but they are ultimately so similar in gameplay that I think it counts. Also, it is so humid in the olympics that you should expect unsleeved cards to warp a bit in the evening. Car camping is much better for the LCG, I wouldn't mind an official two-player mat to drop over a wood table.\n\n \n\nEdit: now wasting my coffee break looking up blank game boards for a good in-tent or on-ground surface, the typical Z-rest only got us so far, but... 1 lbs seems typical, and that is a lot of dead weight.\n\nEdited March 13, 2014 by camacazio"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/101181-the-places-you-have-lotr/?do=findComment&comment=1012585","commentId":1012585,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1394789399,"content":"Mostly at home, but I take decks with me to conferences, so a variety of hotels as well.
