If Balin cancels a shadow card and the deck is empty, do you shuffle to deal another shadow?\n\n2. Similarly, if Seal the Tomb is in play and I have to discard the top 3 encounter cards at the end of the round, but the deck is empty, do I shuffle then?\n\nhttp://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Seal-the-Tomb-TLR [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/Seal-the-Tomb-TLR]\n\n3. Regardless of the answer to 2, I should still reveal the topmost Undead enemy from the encounter discard, since it's not an if/then clause, correct?\n\nThanks for your time!\n\nEdited April 17, 2017 by Network57\nRhudaur, not Ettenmoors, but same question"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247380-ettenmoors-and-empty-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=2735763","commentId":2735763,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1492392637,"content":"Unless otherwise specified, the encounter deck only reshuffles when empty during the quest phase."}]}
