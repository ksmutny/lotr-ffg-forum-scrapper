(paired with Lanwyn and Cirdan with Fearless scout)\n\nUntil now it's pretty efficient in a two handed solo game with another Dale focused combat deck (Brand son of Bain / Bard son of Brand / Beregond Tactics)\n\nI have a rule question, and i can't find the answer.\n\nWhen playing on the same location a Elf Stone and the new attachement Woodmen 's Path which passive effect resolves first?\n\n \n\nffg_elf-stone-tbr.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_elf-stone-tbr.jpg]\n\n \n\nmec67_card_woodmens-path.png [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/4c/76/4c7654b3-044b-40db-8d4b-0dd8aa9a0c7b/mec67_card_woodmens-path.png]\n\n \n\nElf Stone says : +1 quest Point to active location\n\nWoodmen 's Path says : Quests Points are reduced to 1.\n\nSo which one activates first when the location becomes active location? Should I choose? That's not so easy, because both are passive effects on player attachement cards.\n\nI 've played as the location gets only 1. (not adding the +1 from the Elf Stone, but I might be wrong)\n\nAnd no grim rules with this game, it's already hard enough. ^^\n\nThanks for the help.\n\n \n\nEdited July 26, 2018 by Valiko33"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279771-elf-stone-woodmen-s-path-order-of-resolution/?do=findComment&comment=3415978","commentId":3415978,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1532615910,"content":"I don't know what would be actual ruling, but my gut feeling is that since Woodmen's Path reduces the total quest point value and not the printed one, it trumps Elf-stone. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279771-elf-stone-woodmen-s-path-order-of-resolution/?do=findComment&comment=3415992","commentId":3415992,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1532616695,"content":"I don't think it matter which order the passive efforts are applied, since Woodman's Path specifies a fixed value.  So if you do the path first\n\nPath -- sets quest value to 1.\n\nStone -- adds 1, quest value to 2.\n\nPath -- passive kicks in again, sets quest value to 1.\n\n \n\nIf you do Stone first:\n\nStone -- adds 1, quest value to X+1.\n\nPath -- sets quest value to 1.\n\nStone's passive effect can only kick in once, or it would infinitely recur itself."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279771-elf-stone-woodmen-s-path-order-of-resolution/?do=findComment&comment=3416150","commentId":3416150,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1532624793,"content":"Is your Dale combat focused deck running Spirit or Tactics Brand?\n\nI’d be interesting in seeing the decklist of your fellowship, pal!\n\nregarding the rules I think @dalestephenson nailed it\n\nEdited July 26, 2018 by banania"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/279771-elf-stone-woodmen-s-path-order-of-resolution/?do=findComment&comment=3416169","commentId":3416169,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1532625654,"content":"Evidence for @dalestephenson [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/256741-dalestephenson/]'s interpretation can be found in RR Modifiers:\n\n\n\n> If a value is “set” to a specific number, the set modifier overrides all non-set modifiers. If multiple set modifiers are in conflict, the most recently resolved set modifier takes precedence.\n\n\n\n(Boldface added.)
