The rulebook certainly doesn't support it, but if you're keen, you could always give it a shot and let us know how it goes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47559-i-searched-and-cant-find-it-so-ill-just-ask-how-do-you-set-up-the-decks-for-4-players/?do=findComment&comment=476859","commentId":476859,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1306729376,"content":"However, the scaling of the game is all to do with the number of players (i.e. how many cards come out of the encounter deck in the Questing phase) so if you play with only 2 Heroes each, the sole benefit you'll get is lowered starting threat, againt reduced characters, fewer resources etc. I can see it making life pretty tricky."}]}
