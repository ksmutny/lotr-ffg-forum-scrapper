I think this is to much!!!\n\n\n\nI believe it balances with the fact that it only works with one sphere.  I usually play with multiple players, and so far only one player has run Lore, and they rarely function as the combat player.  The players who are defending against enemies rarely get the BBrand, thus they get the effects of shadow cards.  We did get a Song of Wisdom and the BBrand on Aragon once, but that was just once."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55549-despair-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=549548","commentId":549548,"userName":"scottindeed","timestamp":1320041599,"content":"Thanks for the replies.  I guess it's good bye Bilbo in that circumstance!  Unfortunately I had yet to draw Burning Brand.  Burning Brand is a great card, and good that it is restricted to Lore characters - though I guess you could use Song of Wisdom to get it on others."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55549-despair-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=549550","commentId":549550,"userName":"silverhand77","timestamp":1320041959,"content":"scottindeed said:\n\nThanks for the replies.  I guess it's good bye Bilbo in that circumstance!  Unfortunately I had yet to draw Burning Brand.  Burning Brand is a great card, and good that it is restricted to Lore characters - though I guess you could use Song of Wisdom to get it on others.\n\n\n\nYes you can. Song of wisdom gives the attached hero a Lore resource icon, which means that the hero now belongs to the Lore sphere as well as the original sphere it is from (p8 rule book)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55549-despair-shadow-effect/?do=findComment&comment=549571","commentId":549571,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1320046448,"content":"BBrand is also an attachment, which makes it vulnerable to discard effects in some scenarios."}]}
