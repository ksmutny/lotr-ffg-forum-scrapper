Featuring discussion on cards & quests, our various adventures in and out of Middle Earth, as well as offering advice for new players and veterans alike.\n\n\nOne experienced player. One newcomer. Two microphones. Lots of silliness.\n\n\nThere are two episodes currently available to stream, with a third on it's way.\n\nThey can be found at all the usual pod-like places:\nno caption [https://cf.geekdo-images.com/medium/img/78E3Jer8QICqfLqUMRmqUh70YP8=/fit-in/500x500/filters:no_upscale()/pic5378964.png] [https://boardgamegeek.com/image/5378964/hellboyberry]\n(and coming soon to Pandora, iHeart Radio and Google Podcast).

I am a glutton for the wall banging, and I don't mind certain quests being really tough (e.g. Heirs of Numenor), the satisfaction of beating them is 2nd to none. But like you say, with Dol Guldur it just feels like if you don't have a good set up you already know you can't win.
