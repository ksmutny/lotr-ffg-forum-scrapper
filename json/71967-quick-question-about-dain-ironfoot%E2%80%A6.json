Any explanation on this would be very helpful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=702445","commentId":702445,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1348952564,"content":" the \"or\" part of your question is right."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=702836","commentId":702836,"userName":"JasonRed3","timestamp":1349038249,"content":" The bonus only applies while he's ready.  If he's exhausted for any reason (attack, etc.) then the bonus goes away immediately.\n\n \n\nJ"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=702868","commentId":702868,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1349046248,"content":" Oh okay thanks guys. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=2605417","commentId":2605417,"userName":"Randyman","timestamp":1485217150,"content":"Here's some confusion I am having with Dain during the Seventh Level -- if the Book of Mazarbul is attached to Dain, he does not need to exhaust to join the quest.  So during the quest phase, all dwarves will get a +1 willpower, but since he is questing and still ready, can he also give that +1 willpower to himself?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=2605440","commentId":2605440,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1485217819,"content":"Yes, because his bonus applies to all Dwarves, and he is himself a Dwarf."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=2605505","commentId":2605505,"userName":"Randyman","timestamp":1485221309,"content":"Thanks, PW - one more thing to clarify... if the Book of Mazarbul is attached to Dain, and then a Watchful Eyes is revealed, can I also attach the Watchful Eyes to Dain?  Since he will not need to exhaust to go Questing and would not be allowed to attack, only if he exhausts to defend would the Forced effect of Watchful Eyes ever get triggered (?).  Feels a little bit gamey, but if I'm interpreting the cards right, its probably the best thing to do with the Watchful Eyes condition attachment...?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=2605590","commentId":2605590,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1485226844,"content":"Yep. No reason why you can't, and that's the best way to deal with Watchful Eyes. In fact, nothing prevents you from attaching multiple copies of Watchful Eyes to the same hero! They would all trigger separately if that hero were exhausted, so you might want to have a ready effect on hand in case some shadow effect makes you exhaust a character you control and Dain is the only one not yet exhausted, or some other scenario, lest all three of the Watchful Eyes effects trigger at once. But it's perfectly legitimate to put Watchful Eyes on your hero carrying the Book of Marzipan... sorry, Mazarbul, and in fact it's a great play."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=2605608","commentId":2605608,"userName":"Randyman","timestamp":1485228128,"content":"Thanks -- finding odd combinations like this is why I love this game !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=2605709","commentId":2605709,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1485237319,"content":"> In fact, nothing prevents you from attaching multiple copies of Watchful Eyes to the same hero!\n\nThat's not quite true, since it does say \"Limit 1 per hero\", but the rest of your analysis is spot-on."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71967-quick-question-about-dain-ironfoot%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=2605741","commentId":2605741,"userName":"rmunn","timestamp":1485239586,"content":">  \n> \n> > In fact, nothing prevents you from attaching multiple copies of Watchful Eyes to the same hero!\n> \n> That's not quite true, since it does say \"Limit 1 per hero\", but the rest of your analysis is spot-on.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nI looked for that.
