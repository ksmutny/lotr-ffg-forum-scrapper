You have to have the ally you want to play with sneak in your hand. The sneaked ally comes into play under your control. You cannot give control to another player.\n\nThe so played ally doesn´t cost you any resources and lasts only for one phase......but you can play Sneak Attack in any phase, as it is an event.\n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61280-sneak-attack-and-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=601027","commentId":601027,"userName":"jman5000","timestamp":1330633686,"content":"sorry,\n\nI wasn't perfectly clear.  I had Gandalf and Sneak attack in my hand.  the other player had a threat of 49.\n\nI paid my 1 resource to play sneak attack.  I took out Gandalf from my hand, but gave it to my partner.  now, the way I interpreted things, Gandalf is effectively his for that single phase, at which point he can then activate one of Gandalf's bonuses.  The player chose threat reduction, then quested him and at the end of the quest phase, Gandalf returned to my hand.\n\nWhat I am not so clear on is if I can actually play sneak attack and give that ally to my partner, instead of being forced to use the ally myself.  My assumption is yes because nothing on the card says to keep the ally for myself.\n\nJust wondering if I played that correct?\n\nCheers,\n\nJ."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61280-sneak-attack-and-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=601030","commentId":601030,"userName":"jman5000","timestamp":1330634212,"content":"sorry for the double post:\n\nSneak Attack says \"Action:  put 1 ally card into play from your hand...\"\n\nI get the 1 card bit\n\nI get the from your hand bit\n\nbut the \"into play\" part confuses me. \n\nThe rules for the Planning phase are explicit \"After a player plays an ally or attachment card from his hand, he places it faceup and ready in his play area\"\n\nthe rule for \"Actions\" states - \"...In order to trigger an action on a hero, ally or attachment card, the card on which the action is printed must be in play, ...\"\n\nit says a hero, not your hero or the persons hero who is triggering the action.\n\nso, does sneak attack require you to follow the rules for the placement of ally's in the Planning Phase, in which case, they get played in my play area, or do they follow the \"action\" rule, which does not specify *Which* hero, only *A* hero, leading me to believe that includes my coop partner's hero?\n\n \n\ngah!  now I'm sounding like a lawyer. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nCheers,\n\nJ."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61280-sneak-attack-and-gandalf/?do=findComment&comment=601048","commentId":601048,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1330638990,"content":"there are no cards that let you play allies on your partners side.. you can do this with attachments but you can not \"give gandalf to your partner.\" or ANY other cally for that matter.

If another player takes control of that ally, it is moved to the controlling player's play area. Ally cards cannot be played under the control of another player, they can only change control through card effects. "}]}
