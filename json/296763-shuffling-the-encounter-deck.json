It just so happens that a lot of effects ask you to search both areas at the same time. In this case, you should not shuffle the discard into the deck unless explicitly instructed to by the effect.\n\nIn general you only shuffle in the discard pile when the deck is empty in the quest phase, this can be important e.g. for shadow cards.\n\nAlso be aware of any scenario specific rules such as quests with the Sailing keyword. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/296763-shuffling-the-encounter-deck/?do=findComment&comment=3731945","commentId":3731945,"userName":"cgvenuti","timestamp":1561961582,"content":"Thank you both.

No need to shuffle for this."}]}
