Even if you ready him he doesn't have great stats and he doesn't have any traits or specialties that make raising his combat stats easy. If you use Heir of Mardil on him, you essentially just get 1 free resource on him and 1 free willpower added to the quest. The only cost is associated with getting Heir of Mardil into play, and the fact that other than the resource and single point of willpower, you wasted a hero on Theodred.\n\n \n\nI'd much prefer a stronger alternate hero and using the other means of activating Heir of Mardil."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132797-envoy-of-pelargir-heir-of-mardil/?do=findComment&comment=1419424","commentId":1419424,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1422051978,"content":"I still think it's best on Theoden, especially when combined with The Day's Rising.  Add in a Steed of the Mark and he can quest, defend, and attack and use all of his high stats.  The Day's Rising pays for Steed of the Mark, so it's a net zero cost (not counting the cost to play the cards in the first place)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132797-envoy-of-pelargir-heir-of-mardil/?do=findComment&comment=1420216","commentId":1420216,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1422132176,"content":"I made a similar note on TftC for the Antlered Crown hero review. Theoden is the only hero to have all the traits/keywords required to play Captain of Gondor, Heir of Mardil, The Day's Rising, AND Steed of the Mark. Throw on Steward of Gondor and Gondorian Shield too to make him able to quest for 3, defend for 5, and attack for 4 all on the same turn. And now that he has the Gondor trait you could even bump his willpower up with Visionary Leadership too. As sad as Theoden was at first, he is shaping up to be quite the powerhouse. He doesn't have a cool/fun/powerful ability, but his numbers and actions per turn can get pretty ridiculous."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/132797-envoy-of-pelargir-heir-of-mardil/?do=findComment&comment=1420909","commentId":1420909,"userName":"jormungandr","timestamp":1422200962,"content":"Oh help,and then have this guy lead a batallion of outlanders with Fangorn.
