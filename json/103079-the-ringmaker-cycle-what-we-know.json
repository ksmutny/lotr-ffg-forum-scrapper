I’m going to keep bumping this thread and editing this post as we get more information. This thread is only for confirmed spoilers though, and in spite of how well reasoned your guesses might be, I won’t be adding those to the list. (For example, the names of Quests 4 ~ 6 were spoiled on BGG, but the thread was taken down and we don’t have confirmation.)\n\nRumil, Pursuing the Enemy and Galadhrim Minstrell were spoiled with The Dunland Trap, but the wording of the article indicates they are from the cycle and not necessarily that box. (Also, the numbers appear to all be double digits to me.) That is why they are listed as Others.\n\n*Finally, take the card numbers with a grain of salt. I can’t read them very well on my screen and even FFG doesn’t seem to know sometimes as shown by Celeborn and Naith Guide both being called card 1. If you have a better screen and are really sure what the number is, I’ll add that to the list.\n\nEdited June 11, 2014 by Bullroarer Took"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103079-the-ringmaker-cycle-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1037524","commentId":1037524,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1396556782,"content":"We, or at least part of the community, know the names of the rest of the AP's.

Further, they will most likely have them two per pack (one for each but there it is getting harder to guess).\n\n \n\nAlso, since the third pack is supposed to feature no less than six Silvan cards, and Rúmil seem to be fitting there with his number, we might, in addition to the \"regular\" ally and event, see Haldir as a hero, and his brothers Rúmil and Orophin as allies in different spheres.

I was not sure on that.\n\nMost of the ffg articles say say something like this \"Trouble in Tharbad introduces a new Silvan hero, along with three copies of each new player card.\"\n\nMakes it aound like the hero is not included in the player card count, but I'mreally not sure.

For Heirs of Numenor and Against the Shadow, there were two from each sphere (Boromir, Hirluin; Beregond, Theoden; Pippin, Caldara; Mirlonde and Faramir). This wasn't true for Khazad-dûm and Dwarrowdelf, but it was true for Shadows of Mirkwood and Khazad-dûm, which were the first eight heroes after the Core set (Prince Imrahil, Dáin Ironfoot; Brand son of Bain, Boromir; Frodo Baggins, Dwalin; Bilbo Baggins and Bifur). It seems fairly likely that we will have two heroes from each sphere in The Voice of Isengard and the Ring-maker cycle. We've now seen previews for each adventure pack, and we know some information about each hero.\n\n \n\nHere are some guesses as to the heroes we'll see, together with some reasons for those guesses. What we know is in bold.\n\n \n\nThe Voice of Isengard:\n\nEomer. Tactics. Rohan. Noble. Warrior.\n\nGrima. Lore. Rohan. Isengard.\n\n \n\nThe Dunland Trap: Celeborn. Leadership. Silvan. Noble.\n\nThe Three Trials: Idraen. Spirit. Dúnedain. Ranger.\n\nTrouble in Tharbad: Haldir of Lórien. Lore. Silvan. Scout.\n\nThe Nîn-in-Eilph: Halbarad. Leadership. Dúnedain. Ranger.\n\nCelebrimbor's Secret: Galadriel. Spirit. Noldor. Noble.\n\nThe Antlered Crown: Gamling. Tactics. Rohan.\n\n \n\nI'm fairly confident about Idraen. The artist's page [http://jakemurray.deviantart.com/art/Idraen-431989061] describes her as \"a hardened female ranger of the Dunedain.\" It's possible that she's an ally instead of a hero, though we already know that there are three other allies in this pack (Greyflood Wanderer, one Noldor ally and one Silvan ally), together with multiple cards supporting the Silvan trait and Secrecy.\n\n \n\nSince many Silvan cards are Lore, I expect that we'll get a Lore Silvan hero that (unlike Mirlonde) synergizes with Celeborn and Galadriel. We also know, from a Master of Lore interview with the artist of Silver Lamp [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/artist-spotlight-owen-william-weber/], that a new card for Haldir is coming. This new card is probably a hero, he's likely Lore, and he's thematically a perfect match for Celeborn and Galadriel. I'm guessing on the scout trait, but it matches Rumil's trait and we know that we'll be getting a unique Title attachment for scouts [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4739] (almost certainly Spirit, which would fit in a Celeborn/Galadriel/Haldir deck).\n\n \n\nThe last two heroes are more speculative. The designers have been developing Rohan in Spirit and Tactics. I think it unlikely that we'll get three Spirit heroes in the Ring-maker cycle, and especially not two in immediate succession. I'm guessing that the Rohan hero is Gamling from the quote at the beginning of the preview for The Antlered Crown. He's old, and he commanded the defense of Helm's Deep before Théoden arrived. (There are other possibilities, such as Erkenbrand or maybe even a Tactics version of Eowyn.) The Rohan hero could be Leadership, but is more likely Tactics.\n\n \n\nThe Ranger hero has a good chance of being Leadership, since the Nîn-in-Eilph preview says: \"The Nîn-in-Eilph introduces a new Ranger hero as well as twenty-seven new player cards (three copies each of nine different cards) that focus on knowledgeable guidance and wise leadership.\" If all of my sphere guesses are correct, that would mean two heroes from every sphere. Halbarad is definitely a guess, though there aren't many unused Tolkien characters that would fit the Ranger trait. Dúnedain, Gondor and perhaps Silvan seem the most likely associated traits. Given where the adventure pack is set and the focus on Gondor last cycle, a Dúnedain hero seems more likely than than a Gondor hero. If I'm right that the Ranger hero is Leadership, it seems unlikely that we would get two Leadership Silvan heroes in the same cycle. I doubt we'll see our third version of Aragorn or Faramir here, or another copy of Elladan, Elrohir, Damrod or Anborn. Mablung is a possibility, or perhaps an FFG creation. Assuming Idraen is a hero, I doubt that we would get another Dúnedain FFG creation in the same cycle. It also makes sense to have a Leadership Dúnedain hero aside from Aragorn, since most Dúnedain cards are Leadership.\n\n \n\nSpeculating is fun, and in less than a month, we'll have some new cards!\n\nEdited June 4, 2014 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103079-the-ringmaker-cycle-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1108355","commentId":1108355,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1401865757,"content":"Best educated guesses I've seen for this game before.\nReally hope you are right about Halbarad and Gamling.

What we know is in bold.\n> \n>  \n> \n> The Voice of Isengard:\n> \n> Eomer. Tactics. Rohan. Noble. Warrior.\n> \n> Grima. Lore. Rohan. Isengard.\n> \n>  \n> \n> The Dunland Trap: Celeborn. Leadership. Silvan. Noble.\n> \n> The Three Trials: Idraen. Spirit. Dúnedain. Ranger.\n> \n> Trouble in Tharbad: Haldir of Lórien. Lore. Silvan. Scout.\n> \n> The Nîn-in-Eilph: Halbarad. Leadership. Dúnedain. Ranger.\n> \n> Celebrimbor's Secret: Galadriel. Spirit. Noldor. Noble.\n> \n> The Antlered Crown: Gamling. Tactics. Rohan.\n> \n>  \n> \n> I'm fairly confident about Idraen. The artist's page [http://jakemurray.deviantart.com/art/Idraen-431989061] describes her as \"a hardened female ranger of the Dunedain.\" It's possible that she's an ally instead of a hero, though we already know that there are three other allies in this pack (Greyflood Wanderer, one Noldor ally and one Silvan ally), together with multiple cards supporting the Silvan trait and Secrecy.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Since many Silvan cards are Lore, I expect that we'll get a Lore Silvan hero that (unlike Mirlonde) synergizes with Celeborn and Galadriel. We also know, from a Master of Lore interview with the artist of Silver Lamp [https://masteroflore.wordpress.com/2014/04/25/artist-spotlight-owen-william-weber/], that a new card for Haldir is coming. This new card is probably a hero, he's likely Lore, and he's thematically a perfect match for Celeborn and Galadriel. I'm guessing on the scout trait, but it matches Rumil's trait and we know that we'll be getting a unique Title attachment for scouts [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=4739] (almost certainly Spirit, which would fit in a Celeborn/Galadriel/Haldir deck).\n> \n>  \n> \n> The last two heroes are more speculative. The designers have been developing Rohan in Spirit and Tactics. I think it unlikely that we'll get three Spirit heroes in the Ring-maker cycle, and especially not two in immediate succession. I'm guessing that the Rohan hero is Gamling from the quote at the beginning of the preview for The Antlered Crown. He's old, and he commanded the defense of Helm's Deep before Théoden arrived. (There are other possibilities, such as Erkenbrand or maybe even a Tactics version of Eowyn.) The Rohan hero could be Leadership, but is more likely Tactics.\n> \n>  \n> \n> The Ranger hero has a good chance of being Leadership, since the Nîn-in-Eilph preview says: \"The Nîn-in-Eilph introduces a new Ranger hero as well as twenty-seven new player cards (three copies each of nine different cards) that focus on knowledgeable guidance and wise leadership.\" If all of my sphere guesses are correct, that would mean two heroes from every sphere. Halbarad is definitely a guess, though there aren't many unused Tolkien characters that would fit the Ranger trait. Dúnedain, Gondor and perhaps Silvan seem the most likely associated traits. Given where the adventure pack is set and the focus on Gondor last cycle, a Dúnedain hero seems more likely than than a Gondor hero. If I'm right that the Ranger hero is Leadership, it seems unlikely that we would get two Leadership Silvan heroes in the same cycle. I doubt we'll see our third version of Aragorn or Faramir here, or another copy of Elladan, Elrohir, Damrod or Anborn. Mablung is a possibility, or perhaps an FFG creation. Assuming Idraen is a hero, I doubt that we would get another Dúnedain FFG creation in the same cycle. It also makes sense to have a Leadership Dúnedain hero aside from Aragorn, since most Dúnedain cards are Leadership.\n> \n>  \n> \n> Speculating is fun, and in less than a month, we'll have some new cards!\n\nYou were right about Idraen and looks like your going to be right about haldir too! I think it's gonna be Mablung instead of Halbarad though. Considering how similar they are however kinda still counts as correct."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103079-the-ringmaker-cycle-what-we-know/?do=findComment&comment=1329353","commentId":1329353,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1415643986,"content":"This hasn't been updated in a while.
