Do not place it in a player’s discard pile or in the encounter deck discard pile\n\nIf a player card with the encounter keyword is dealt as a shadow card to an enemy, it is treated like an encounter card: place it in the encounter discard pile after resolving that enemy’s attack."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300234-ranger-of-the-north-which-discard-pile/?do=findComment&comment=3788907","commentId":3788907,"userName":"DarkPhoenix","timestamp":1568890870,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Alonewolf87 said:\n> \n> It's explained in the Lost Realm rules:\n> \n> If a player card with the encounter keyword leaves play, it is removed from the game.
