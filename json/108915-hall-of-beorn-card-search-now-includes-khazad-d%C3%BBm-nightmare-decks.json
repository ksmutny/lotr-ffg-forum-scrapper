Cool differentiation between different types/breeds of orcs. Also works well with the goblin resource mechanic on seventh level, if Marul and the taskmasters got resource counters that quest would be impossible."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108915-hall-of-beorn-card-search-now-includes-khazad-d%C3%BBm-nightmare-decks/?do=findComment&comment=1125271","commentId":1125271,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1403103749,"content":"My pack should arrive in few days from USA.
