Wording?","comments":[{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89322-base-set-tactics-card-stand-together-wording/?do=findComment&comment=851304","commentId":851304,"userName":"ShuffleTheDeck","timestamp":1377611699,"content":"It might just be me, but I have tried to find a ruling on the Base Set Tactics card: Stand Together and see nothing online. Why is that? The wording on the card makes no sense to be playing the card whatsoever.\n\nAction: Choose a player. That player may declare any number of his eligible characters as defenders against each enemy attacking HIM this phase.\n\nIs it worded incorrectly? When would not you be able to declare defenders for yourself? Are there enemies/treacheries that disallow dedenders I am not thinking of somewhere? It would seem it is meant to temporarily give the Sentinel trait to another player's characters and allow him to declare defenders for another one, But it says for HIM???\n\nSince they only supplied 1 copy in the base set it would seem it should be a quality card, but I never see it in any deck lists. Why has there been no FAQ on this card which could be amazing... Or with many cards in this game so poorly worded it is worthless?\n\nThoughts? Rulings...\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89322-base-set-tactics-card-stand-together-wording/?do=findComment&comment=851313","commentId":851313,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377612265,"content":"you can only ever declare one character as a defender, this card allows any number to be declared....so you could pick say 3 allies with a combined 10 defense to defend an attack of 12. in this case the 2 damage has to be applied to only 1 character\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89322-base-set-tactics-card-stand-together-wording/?do=findComment&comment=851412","commentId":851412,"userName":"ShuffleTheDeck","timestamp":1377617596,"content":"Ah, that is how it works then, figured there must be something I was missing. In reality, its very limited in use and practically useless to exhaust that many characters to reduce damage. Unless that enemy had some additional effect that was creating an effect if chump blockers were destroyed. Which even Smaug doesn't do... Hence it's not in any deck lists.\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89322-base-set-tactics-card-stand-together-wording/?do=findComment&comment=851473","commentId":851473,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377621498,"content":"yeah i dont use it very often. a decent combo could be using it with 3x gondorian spearmen (3 damage upon defending) and each of them having a spear of the citadel (another 3 damage) so you could in theory take down a 6 HP enemy upon defendng\n\nEdited August 27, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89322-base-set-tactics-card-stand-together-wording/?do=findComment&comment=852615","commentId":852615,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1377714485,"content":"Now that card has little use, but when you had only the core set, it had some play, at least for my part.\n\n \n\nHill Troll  seems a good choice to defend using this card, if you have few remaining threat or have few reducing threat choices on your deck...\n\n \n\nHill Troll reads: Excess combat damage dealt by Hill Troll (damage that is dealt beyond the remaining hit points of the character damaged by its attack) must be assigned as an increase to your threat.\n\nEdited August 28, 2013 by CJMatos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89322-base-set-tactics-card-stand-together-wording/?do=findComment&comment=853140","commentId":853140,"userName":"Nerdmeister","timestamp":1377776808,"content":"I think Feint would be first choice most of the time.
