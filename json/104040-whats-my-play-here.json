In my deck and haven’t seen one of them.)  Hennemarth and Master of the Forge are in play and tapped.  My current threat is 20.\n\n \n\nIn my hand are: Haldir, Elf Stone, Vilya (finally drawn with Master even though I have 3 copies), Galadhrim’s Greeting, Unexpected Courage, Mirkwood Runner, and Gandalf (Hobbit, not core).  I’ve just entered the planning phase and I have a total of 6 resources to play with.\n\n \n\nWhat’s the best play here?  I’ll post my plan later, but I would love to see a better idea.  (I know this is imperfect information since you don’t know the contents of my deck, but it’s mostly what I’ve posted on the Strategy page under the Elven Alliance thread with a couple copies of Power of Orthanc)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104040-whats-my-play-here/?do=findComment&comment=1051648","commentId":1051648,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1397666780,"content":"Unexpected Courage and Vilya on Elrond and hope for the best."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104040-whats-my-play-here/?do=findComment&comment=1051772","commentId":1051772,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1397671747,"content":"While nearly all of my deck will result in \"hits\" for Vilya, I think that if I play Gandalf and eat the two threat per turn I'll get a little longer to dig for solutions.  Neither are slam dunks and it looks pretty bleak..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/104040-whats-my-play-here/?do=findComment&comment=1051821","commentId":1051821,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1397674546,"content":"Well, in the absence of any other ideas (I think there are really only those two plays though) I went ahead and tried the Vilya strategy...
