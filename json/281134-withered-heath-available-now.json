At no point did I feel uncertain of victory and I even gave up adding my willpower because 25+ is always greater than the 5 threat added during staging.\n\nIt's not a knock against the quest. It's fun, although I do think it's an unnecessarily long one in having to fight the Dragon twice, with his damage cap. But these two decks got set up so well that I was acutely aware that there were 4 quest stages."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281134-withered-heath-available-now/?do=findComment&comment=3444963","commentId":3444963,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1534617322,"content":"I had a similar experience. Once you're set up, you can feel reasonably confident that you'll win.

My latest game i went through my whole 50 card play deck (that never happens) and ended with 1 card left in my hand and a threat of 48, all my allies were killed, but the three heroes surviving (Gandalf, Legolas, Eowyn) finally brought down the drake. It did not help having to spend ages finding the clues and having the dragon fully healed again before i cornered him for the 2nd time, but i was not after a quick game and this was great fun.\n\nI do like quests with a story and with the weather and cave hunting this one really has got it for me > http://crusadersgames.co.uk/board-games/lord-of-the-rings-lcg/ [http://crusadersgames.co.uk/board-games/lord-of-the-rings-lcg/]"}]}
