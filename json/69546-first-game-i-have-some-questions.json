No\n\n2. No\n\n3. It depends on the effect which requires you to discard an attachment: if it says, \"discard an attachment you control\", since you don't control the Condition Attachment from the encounter deck, you cannot choose it to be discarded; if it just says, \"discard an attachment\", then you can choose the Condition Attachment to be discarded.\n\n4. It just means the action, if used, have to be used during combat phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69546-first-game-i-have-some-questions/?do=findComment&comment=678744","commentId":678744,"userName":"hoduken","timestamp":1345566319,"content":"Thanks!
