I wanted to surprise people, but after seeing whiplash I wanted to just tell yo uguys in case it IS what i am trying and I didn;t want my scenario to look derivative..\n\nAnyway it is a quest series that end in a final awesome battle with a ubr powerful foe.. but unlike most quest the quest card is in fact a monster, and the encounter deck is the monster abilities.. so instead of drawing a goblin card you draw a type of attack with a auto engage effect, locations are dodging and positioning to give bonuses to attack various part of the monster...\n\nEither way... this new card looks awesome.. I can not wait for Darowdelf,, I am just hanging to play this... Khaz was kind of liek a holding pattern for me.. like it was cool.. but the entire thing felt like i as just getting \"ready\" for the real quests.. Darowdelf is going to be great I can feel it!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61459-preview-for-last-pack-is-online/?do=findComment&comment=602467","commentId":602467,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1330963631,"content":"Couple of months before some share the info about all the packs of this s cycle but ffg very quick deleted all info from the forum. So i already knew before we will meet Balrog in the last pack. Actually i love this cycle is much better than first one and the first pack  is diffcult 6 is mean they make it more challenge and the last should be 9 same as Osgiliath. Cool!!!! love it!!!!
