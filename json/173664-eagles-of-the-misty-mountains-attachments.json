Do you control the facedown eagle attachments on Eagles of the Misty Mountains? Or are they a different kind of attachment since you didn't play them?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/173664-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=1587109","commentId":1587109,"userName":"SauronTheGreat","timestamp":1429667492,"content":"I've always played so but don't quote me on that."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/173664-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=1587138","commentId":1587138,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1429668732,"content":"No, you don't control them in the meaning that you cannot use those eagles to anything, since by the text on Eagles of the Misty Mountains [http://hallofbeorn.com/Cards/Details/Eagles-of-the-Misty-Mountains-RtM] those cards have left play....\n\n \n\nOr am i missunderstanding your question?\n\nEdited April 22, 2015 by CJMatos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/173664-eagles-of-the-misty-mountains-attachments/?do=findComment&comment=1587154","commentId":1587154,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1429669956,"content":"Yes you do control them.
