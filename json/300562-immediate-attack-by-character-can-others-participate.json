I am really hoping that others can participate, but I don't know for sure.\n\nThe Great Yew Bow specifically says \"No other attackers can be declared for this attack.\"  The other cards do not have this printed limitation, so I want to interpret it to mean you may include other attackers.\n\nExamples:  Eomer (T/hero), Grimbeorn the Old (T/hero), Haldir of Lorien (Lo/hero), Knight of Minas Tirith (T/ally), Quick Strike (T/event), Hands Upon the Bow (T/event), Battle-Fury (T/event)\n\nThanks for any input on this! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300562-immediate-attack-by-character-can-others-participate/?do=findComment&comment=3795267","commentId":3795267,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1569690525,"content":"Generally, no one else can join.
