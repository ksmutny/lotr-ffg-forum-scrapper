I played it like this:\n\n1) They attack every player in player order during monster attacks, each time with new shadow card.\n\n2) During player attacks, each player can attack this enemy seperately.\n\n \n\nAm i doing this wrong or right? Can we attack the enemy together without ranged characters if it's engaged with all of us?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281513-considered-to-be-engaged-with-each-player/?do=findComment&comment=3450519","commentId":3450519,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1535115271,"content":"1) Correct.\n\n2) Correct.\n\nNo, only one player can attack at a time, excepting Ranged. Of course, Ranged characters could attack the enemy once per player in the combat phase if they had enough readying."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281513-considered-to-be-engaged-with-each-player/?do=findComment&comment=3451267","commentId":3451267,"userName":"Zura","timestamp":1535184757,"content":"> 19 hours ago, Wandalf the Gizzard said:\n> \n> 1) Correct.\n> \n> 2) Correct.\n> \n> No, only one player can attack at a time, excepting Ranged.
