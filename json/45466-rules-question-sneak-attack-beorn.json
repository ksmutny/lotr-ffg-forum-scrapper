At the end of the phase in which you trigger this effect, shuffle Beorn back into your deck. (Limit once per round.)\n\nSneak Attack - Action: Put 1 ally card into play from your hand.

I can see FFG defining \"End Of Phase\" more officially later.\n\n \n\nAlso, when you can play Event cards during each Phase, and even Phase 6: Combat, is defined a little differently in the rules section for that Phase versus the little chart at the end of the rulebook on when player actions happen....  So... yeah.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45466-rules-question-sneak-attack-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=456083","commentId":456083,"userName":"CrowOfPyke","timestamp":1303239072,"content":"Apophenia said:\n\nAcererak said:\n\n \n\nAs written, I think Beorn text overides Sneak Attack, since you start using the ability after Sneak Attack.

I was under the impression that Acererak was claiming that Beorn would get shuffled into the deck because it would still trigger even if Beorn was in your hand. (Rereading it I believe Acererak was actually saying that you shuffle Beorn into the deck because you used his ability after you used Sneak Attack) If that part of Beorn text would still apply when Beorn was in an out of play state like your hand then it should equally apply to your discard pile. \n\nHowever I do agree with you that Beorn should go in the discard if he uses his ability and then is killed. I also agree with you that since Beorn and Sneak Attack both trigger at the same time that the First Player should decide the order.\n\nSorry if there was any confusion about what I did/am saying."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45466-rules-question-sneak-attack-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=456105","commentId":456105,"userName":"Acererak","timestamp":1303241193,"content":"Apophenia said:\n\n(Rereading it I believe Acererak was actually saying that you shuffle Beorn into the deck because you used his ability after you used Sneak Attack)\n\n\n\n \n\nYes, that was exactly what I meant to say. Sorry if it was not stated clearly enough.\n\n \n\nI do agree that Beorn goes to discard if he dies but precisely for the same reason i think he goes to deck and not to hand if his ability is used after Sneak Attack : being defeated interrupts the effect on Beorns card, and gets applied before the other effect can be completed. Same thing with Beorn ability after coming into play through Sneak Attack.\n\n \n\nOtherwise, Sneak Attack (a 1 resource cost event) is being used with much stronger effects than intended imo (same with Gandalf combo).\n\n \n\nOfficial clarification will be welcomed."}]}
