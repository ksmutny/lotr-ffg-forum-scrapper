They are indeed inventing a lot of stuff, specially the things regarding the subplots that don't relate directly to the novel itself (they are basically interpreting the Appendices and mixing them with The Hobbit) but that's because the appendices and most of the info about that is so vague and simple that they have to invent dialogue, situations, scenes, etc. But it's not like the things they're adding are things that couldn't have happened (and it's no different than many of the stuff they \"invent\" for this game). I'm still looking forward to the films and will definately go to see them in cinemas. Plus, if you want the lore, you still got the book (and the rankin bass film to some extent). I am not so critical when relating it to the books, and want to enjoy the films as films alone (also because of the \"cool\" factor; I mean, they are made to be enjoyed, so I don't really care if they exaggerate some things)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71339-new-hobbit-movie-trailer/?do=findComment&comment=697339","commentId":697339,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1348142787,"content":"these are all valid points, however the over riding factor here is i am purely not interested in a film being made of the hobbit- i never was, even after the trilogy films and all the talk on it, i just thought, nah- im not seeing it. ive seen what jackson's interpretation of middle earth is, it has alot bad points and being fair alot of very good points, however ive seen it and have moved on….\n\nperhaps if someone else had done the film i would be more engaged with it, but being honest when i want to visit middle earth i have the real thing in my study….----warning cheesy comment ahead---- and afterall the imagination is the most powerful processor of all gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71339-new-hobbit-movie-trailer/?do=findComment&comment=697635","commentId":697635,"userName":"Runner5","timestamp":1348177446,"content":"Captain Poe said:\n\nThe hobbit has always been, and will always be my favorite book.

I had mixed emotions a decade or so ago when the movies came out as i wanted to see them but i knew for sure that a lot of detail would be left out. It would need a hundred movies to even touch the real storyline but they had to do their best in the time given to them. Im a huge fan of Tom Bombadil, the single biggest enigma in the whole works (in my opinion) but we dont even get a sniff of him in the films as they havent got a clue what the hell he is !!! Im glad they did it but im frustrated like mad (if that makes sense) Cheers."}]}
