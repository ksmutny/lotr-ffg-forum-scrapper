So which is it it technically?\n\n \n\nMore generally, can actions only be taken in strict sequence when the rulebook shows a green action window slot? I have always played it this way, but some of my buds think you can play actions anytime you want regardless of timing. Which is it? I have always been a little confused on this one.\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106380-basic-game-question-from-a-long-time-player/?do=findComment&comment=1086599","commentId":1086599,"userName":"ricedwlit","timestamp":1400200167,"content":"The rule book states the following for green boxes (which is the color used for \".. player plays ally and attachment cards\"):\n\n\"Any player can take actions generally...\"\n\n \n\nSo you should be able to pay for Steward of Gondor, exhaust it to get two clues, and then use those clues to pay for more allies/attachments."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106380-basic-game-question-from-a-long-time-player/?do=findComment&comment=1086652","commentId":1086652,"userName":"tacomen253","timestamp":1400204116,"content":"I made a thread on this exact question not too long ago, here [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/104143-events-during-planning-phase/] is the link to it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/106380-basic-game-question-from-a-long-time-player/?do=findComment&comment=1086684","commentId":1086684,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1400207527,"content":"Thanks tacomen.
