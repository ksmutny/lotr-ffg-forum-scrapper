So that would be:\n\n 1. Search for the square in the Encounter deck and reveal it\n 2. Shuffle\n 3. Surge\n 4. Make West gates the active location\n 5. Shuffle again\n\nIt is a bit awkward. Shuffle in step 2 may be unnecessary, since you do not change the order of the cards. But this would prevent cheating (selecting the location after knowledge of the first card of the Encounter deck, which would be the surge card.)\n\n \n\nYou could drop an email to Caleb, he is very responsive (and kind).\n\nEdited August 27, 2013 by zeb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=851292","commentId":851292,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1377611283,"content":"I think ruined square would still surge because the west gate says to \"REVEAL, then add to the staging area\" if it was just added I don't think the surge would trigger so the word reveal was purposefully put in...not that I know why anyone would willingly choose the action for west gate (that is until FFG errata's it with the line \"players may not travel to the west gate\" like I'm sure the intent was)\n\nFor the ruined tower, I've been playing as though you need an active location to travel there as the first line in its travel action is \"if there is an active location in play\". So you would not be able to travel to the tower if there were no other osgiliath locations\n\nCould be wrong on all of it, that's just how I've been playing\n\nEdited August 27, 2013 by Pharmboys2013"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=851293","commentId":851293,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1377611331,"content":"> can you travel to the ruined tower normally, or do you have to have do its action of having 2 active locations?\n> \n> thanks\n\nI always assume what is not prohibited is allowed, so I would say yes (until the next errata maybe :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] )"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=851310","commentId":851310,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377612000,"content":"thanks for the responses, i think the shuffle makes sense, as for the tower it is a little ambiguous, i shall see what caleb says\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=851782","commentId":851782,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377640806,"content":"got a reply back from caleb. you dont have to exhuast a character if there is no active location"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=851878","commentId":851878,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1377643860,"content":"> got a reply back from caleb. you dont have to exhuast a character if there is no active location\n\n \n\nhmm, interesting. did he say anything about west gate?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=851962","commentId":851962,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377648944,"content":"no, this was his reply\n\nHi Richard,\nIf there is no active location, then you do not have to exhaust a character to travel to Ruined Tower.\nThe surge keyword is only triggered when you reveal the card with surge. For this reason, some search effects say \"search for an encounter card and reveal it...\" If the search effect does not say to reveal the card, then you do not trigger surge.\nHope you're enjoying the scenario!\nCaleb\n\n \n\nhowever i read that west gate is different to the tower in that you have to do its action to travel....becuase it doesnt say 'if there is X, do Y to travel....' it just says 'do X to travel...'\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=852251","commentId":852251,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1377678204,"content":"> however i read that west gate is different to the tower in that you have to do its action to travel....becuase it doesnt say 'if there is X, do Y to travel....' it just says 'do X to travel...'\n\nI thought that Actions were completely voluntary? Do you mean that for a location with an action, this action has to be done to travel here (in other words, that this overrides the normal travel rules by the golden rule? Why calling that an Action if it is a prerequisite then?)?\n\nFurthermore, what is the difference between \"Travel\" and \"Action\" on a Location card? I will look at the FAQ again if I missed something.\n\nEdited August 28, 2013 by zeb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=852500","commentId":852500,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1377704816,"content":"on second look probably not, as it would say cannot be travelled to or similar\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89279-ruined-square/?do=findComment&comment=853935","commentId":853935,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1377843922,"content":"I'm playing West Gate like it's a forced reaction (which it probably should be). However as it is labelled as an action, I think the player can choose to travel there. It makes little sense though. The only reason to do this that I can imagine is that players wishes to bring East or West Quarter into play so that they can use their keywords once West Gate has been explored."}]}
