Any tips?\n\nI personally have no interest in printing the quests, even though for stuff like the first age expansion you can easily get the pdfs.\n\nThese type of quests really lent themselfs to OCTGN as it is much easier to download than to print, cut and maybe even glue and sleeve the cards (not even mentioning the colours can be completely off/different from what you expect)\n\nIf the quest \"just\" throws together different encounter cards (what can make for awesome quests as the pool is even larger than for player cards) I might do that, but even in this case the hassle to pick sometimes only 1 or 2 from an expansion is far greater than just to play it on OCTGN."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/284967-lotr-fan-made-custom-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3545661","commentId":3545661,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1543068300,"content":"I do print some of the quest, but only on paper.
