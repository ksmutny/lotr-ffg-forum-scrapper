I really wanted to play and thought: what the hell, I'll give it a go. And so I did. I made a deck with the expansion, and the 3 APs I own (WitW, FoS & SaF) and started the \"into the Pit\" quest. I really thought I didn't stand a change without the core set spirit cards and my very limited cardpool.\n\nBut what do you think? I made it! barely, Bifur died and Glorfindel & Elrond had 1 hp left, but I won. Who whould have thought?\n\nI had a vey good & fun 1st time playing solo, and am itching to do so again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  and, I'm now getting the core set btw :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79107-who-says-you-need-the-core-set/?do=findComment&comment=761587","commentId":761587,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1360591171,"content":"Wow, that's awesome, way to go!

It was a hassle, so I figured that when I wanted to play alone I would need the core set anyway as I missed some improtant cards I used multiplayer. So I got it yesterday, and I'm gonna play alone tomorrow again :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI just felt so proud and needed to tell the world that gives a **** about this game (thus here) I beat a quest with such a limited cardpool being a newbie and all, and thinking I needed a core set to play or win. ^_^ [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_happy.png]\n\nI agree it's playable with 1 core set though, we did so with 3 players. 2 sets does increase options, as we can all multicolor spheres more easily now.\n\n \n\nOh and narsil: thanks! I picked to Aps based on the heroes, not the timeline ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n "}]}
