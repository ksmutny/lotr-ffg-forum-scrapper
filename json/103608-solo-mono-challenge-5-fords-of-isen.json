The players will make 4 mono-sphere decks (1 for each sphere) and play this quest 3 times with each deck. \n\nIf you want to join, build 4 mono sphere decks- 1 Spirit, 1 Leadership, 1 Lore and 1 Tactics. As a mono-sphere deck I mean deck that only contains cards of that specific sphere or neutral cards. The deck can't include more than 15 neutral cards. Additionaly, you can't control more than 2 heroes, that share the same Trait (except for Noble and Warrior)=> (e.g. you can not play trio of Thorin, Dáin and Balin, cos they are all dwarves. But you can for example play Beravor, Faramir, Denethor as not a single Trait is shared by 3 different heroes ). \n\nThen, you will record your score for each game and player with smallest total score of the 12 games is the WINNER! If you lose, it counts as score of \"250\". \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou may also receive special score reduction from this list:\nSPIRIT:\n-50 for not using spirit Glorfindel.\n-30 for using at least one spirit Dwarf hero\nTACTICS:\n-50 for not using Théoden\n-30 for using Elladan\nLEADERSHIP:\n-30 for using Elrohir\n-40 for using Hirluin the Fair\nPENALTY +50 for using Dain Ironfoot\nLORE:\n-80 for using Bilbo Baggins!!!

Second, I am very interesting in this sort of challenges that are precisely the way I (and my friends) are approaching the game.\n\nI tried yesterday night to start the challenge. Due to time constraint, I was only able to do just one time the Ford of Isen with Grima, Mirlonde, Loragorn.\n\nScore 96 (7x10+27-1).\n\n \n\nExcept the fact to have double Grima (objectif ally and Hero) that seems to be acceptable for this challenge (according to Scroll Lock post #13), I really appreciated the game as it was my first test of my Grima deck.\n\n \n\nHere is my build, feel free to comment :\n\nThe Heros seems for me auto-include for a mono sphere build as intention to diminish the doom effect generated by Grima. I build the deck based on the master of the forge engine with key attachments.\n\n1          Dori\n\n1          Gleowine\n\n2          Erebor Hammersmith\n\n3          Master of the Forge\n\n3          Warden of Healing\n\n2          Daughter of the Nimrodel\n\n2          Haldir of Lorien\n\n2          Gildor Inglorion\n\n3          Gandalf\n\n19 allies\n\n \n\n3          Daeron's Rune\n\n3          Deep Knowledge\n\n3          Mithrandir's Advice\n\n9 Events\n\n \n\n3          Asfaloth\n\n3          Keys of Orthanc\n\n3          Elf-stone\n\n3          Scroll of Isildur\n\n2          Healing Herbs\n\n3          Ranger Spikes\n\n2          A burning Brand\n\n3          Protector of Lorien\n\n22 Attachments\n\n \n\nThe design of this deck was, of course, not made for this precise quest.\n\nFor last night game, the deck and I took some time to be set (5 rounds for the 1st phase) but it went incredibly fast after (thanks to cards drawing and Protector of Loriens)  : 2 rounds for phase 2 and just 1 questing session for the last phase (discarding 3x3cards to my protectors). I did go through the whole player deck by the end of the game. Protector of Lorien was, of course, MVP as it enabled me to get my hand size at the optimum level each time.\n\n \n\nThe first intent of the deck was to be played in multiplayer to bring a good support in questing (traps and protector), blocking foes (Loragorn, Haldir and burning brands) and most of all in healing. Normally, it should go with a Glorfindel, Caldara, Eowyn mono spirit and a Beregond, Legolas, Merry mono tactics.\n\n \n\nI will try to finish the challenge, but not tonight as I will play multiplayer.\n\nEdited April 16, 2014 by Courchevel"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103608-solo-mono-challenge-5-fords-of-isen/?do=findComment&comment=1051688","commentId":1051688,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1397667871,"content":"My lore deck for it doesnt run so good, but ok:\n\n \n\nGlorfindel · Mirlonde · Pippin:\n\n \n\n1s game: 121\n\n2nd game: 167\n\n3rd game: 146\n\n \n\nTotal score-lore: 434 :mellow: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_mellow.png]\n\n \n\nBad luck with enemies, a lot of hard them were revealed.

I came eventually up with the same combo as Mndala.\n\n \n\nThe first game was the closest of the three. The Zigil Miner / Stargazer Combo fed me with enough resources to play some allies plus Hobbit Gandalf, plus twice Saruman. That way I could defeat some of the tougher enemies. In my last turn I used Caldara's ability to play Elfhelm and the Northern tracker tpo defeat the remaining enemies.\n\n \n\nThe second and third game were easier, thanks to kind draws from the encounter deck (and again the Miner/Stargazer combo). In my last game I could have finished one turn earlier, but I decided to give up Hobbit Gandalf tio play another version from my hand. I was one resource short, however, but hoped to get one more resource from Zigil Miner's ability. I had Stargazer sacrificed earlier, and of course I guessed wrongly, couldn't play Gandalf and had thus to add another turn.\n\nEdited April 19, 2014 by leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103608-solo-mono-challenge-5-fords-of-isen/?do=findComment&comment=1055204","commentId":1055204,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1397948357,"content":"Caldara is powerful: you can put into game, 1 damrod, 1 elfhelm and several trackers... all joined has 10attack (poor chieftain dunland :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png].

Most of the plot twists will destroy a solo deck, the game mechanics make it very difficult to handle both quest and combat with one single deck and then there is still the villain to defeat. IMO this scenario is a design desaster for solo play. I only play it with house rules like being able to choose the plot twist. Two handed it is fun, solo it's just frustrating."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/103608-solo-mono-challenge-5-fords-of-isen/?do=findComment&comment=1059800","commentId":1059800,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1398294975,"content":"Nobody participates on this FordsIsern challenge?
