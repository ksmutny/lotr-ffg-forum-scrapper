The community was pretty vocal about the steep difficulty of the HoN quests and the inviability of solo play, but now that they've given us what the majority (not all, I'll grant you) asked for--lower difficulty quests that scale in difficulty the more people play them--we are all complaining.\n\nSecond, while this quest IS easier than any of the quests we've had in a while, I liked it. The quest was mechanically enjoyable to me, which is all I really care about. I DO understand that some people play the game because they enjoy the kind of challenge HoN gave...but to be honest everyone I have ever played Into Ithilian with has found it unenjoyably hard. So do I most of the time, and I'm a fairly experienced player. At that difficulty, all decks start to look and act the same.\n\nI also think it needs to be brought up again that this quest (like Druadan Forest and Journey to Rhosgobel) gets harder the more players are at the table, which seems like a much more manageable way of balancing the game than weighting it to larger groups and making it almost impossible to solo unless you are running one of a handful of power decks.\n\nTake everything I'm saying with a grain of salt though as I am kind of a special case. I am in the camp that found HoN was balanced wrong and was far too difficult, yet I also hate \"easy mode\" as it tends to sap some of the most interesting cards from the encounter decks."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85895-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=819107","commentId":819107,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374508543,"content":"played this first time today and loved it! great quest that is around the right difficulty for me, its also very thematic.\n\n \n\n. ....also it threw quite a few nasty combos....listen to this...\n\n \n\nshadow cards...i got the orc arsonist, the scourge of mordor, and the other one that gives shadow cards per player...i ended up with 9 shadow cards in the end!!!

And I think we NEEDED a few easier quests at this point in the game as a new player coming in now isn't going to necessarily start in Shadows of Mirkwood. Even if they WANTED to go back and play them in order it's almost impossible to find some of the Mirkwood cycle at this point, and even when they reprint that would be a HUGE cost. After all, a new MTG player doesn't buy every card from all the previous cycles when they get into the game--it's not practical and we are approaching that point with this game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85895-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=819247","commentId":819247,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1374518765,"content":"> And what did you think of DF? btw wasn't the story awesome?\n\nno idea! still havnt got it! i have it on pre order but managed to get amon din from a friend. i was trying really hard not to play it but in the end i gave up and just played it for the game and tried not to look at the spoiler text. ..so at the moment amon din is just a random encounter with orcs, and not part of the cycle narrative...another annoying thing about the pack problems in the uk....but if its half as good as this then it will be great, amon din has gone straight to my top 5\n\n \n\n@jonofpdx - i know! and i agree with you, i was one of the players asking for this level of quests and im happy we got it\n\nEdited July 22, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85895-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=821357","commentId":821357,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1374732392,"content":"Does anyone now about when assault on Osgiliath will be releashed ? \n\n \n\nIs there any clue about its hero ? \n\nEdited July 25, 2013 by Nickpes"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85895-amon-din/?do=findComment&comment=821463","commentId":821463,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1374739463,"content":"I like this quest.
