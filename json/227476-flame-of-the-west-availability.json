New expansions are usually listed quite a bit before they're on sale and then they go up through Amazon and third party sellers after the release date. But it's like it doesn't even exist.  \n\n \n\nDoes anyone have any idea why this would be? I'm really itching to pick up a copy, but I check Amazon every day and still no luck. Did I miss a memo along the way about a delay to certain sellers? Are any other sites or stores having the same issue? Or did Amazon just lose it's mind?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227476-flame-of-the-west-availability/?do=findComment&comment=2361501","commentId":2361501,"userName":"flightmaster101","timestamp":1471009122,"content":"Usually these kind of games are sold on amazon by 3rd party sellers.  If you step back this is kind of a niche market, especially compared to their other products.  So if the 3rd parties are selling out in their brick & motor stores or their own online stores they might not feel the need to list it on amazon.  There are also a few other websites you could go to like coolstuffinc.com and miniaturemarket.com that would have it if you do want to get an online discount."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227476-flame-of-the-west-availability/?do=findComment&comment=2361522","commentId":2361522,"userName":"Phlegethontia","timestamp":1471009448,"content":"It's a lot harder to get this stuff now for sure.
