Going to try this guy out today. Back to my topic. I would very much like to see another Gondor weapon attachment. I know there is Spear of the Citadel but it's really only good for certain defending characters. Gondor has very limited options for offensive weapons such as Blade of Gondolin and Dagger of Westernesse. Both Meh IMO. Maybe a Citadel sword or Gondorian bow would be great additions to a Gondor tactics deck. \n\nEdited September 1, 2014 by GondorianFire"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120894-gondor-weapon-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=1242138","commentId":1242138,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1409591605,"content":"Technically, Ranger Bow could be the thing you're describing and it's already in the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120894-gondor-weapon-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=1242366","commentId":1242366,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1409600719,"content":"> Technically, Ranger Bow could be the thing you're describing and it's already in the game.\n\nTrue, but I assume he's looking for something more aimed at Minas Tirith warriors than the rangers.

So I switched it out for Blade of Gondolin which is really only good for questing unless you're facing mass orcs. Also some quests punish you for questing too quickly. I suppose I could try adding Gaining Strength, Wealth of Gondor, and Horn of Gondor to my Tactics/Leadership deck, but I'd be trading out some good cards. I totally see your point about a Gondorian bow being out of the question but there should definitely be another weapon option besides Blade of Gondolin for Gondor IMO.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120894-gondor-weapon-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=1243221","commentId":1243221,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1409642334,"content":"> I love Gondorian fire\n\n \n\nHahahahaahahahahahahaha no kidding dude :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120894-gondor-weapon-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=1243276","commentId":1243276,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1409645688,"content":"I had something like this in my cutom thug expansions. It was a leadershit weapon attachment that added +1 attack to the wielder, and +1 additional attack if another thug participated in attack with the wielder together. This concept could be used as a gondorian weapon with the trait swap. Also, another thought, is a gondorian weapon which gives the wielder +1 attack, and +1 additional attack if he has at least 1 resource in his resource pool, to support the overall gondor rich theme."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120894-gondor-weapon-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=1244145","commentId":1244145,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1409685215,"content":"A couple of quick \"out of the box\" essays I made regarding your desire for gondorian weaponry.\n\n \n\nQC7pTj7hR8M.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c623329/v623329009/bdd/QC7pTj7hR8M.jpg]\n\n \n\nqZlYZEu2Zm8.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c623329/v623329009/bd5/qZlYZEu2Zm8.jpg]\n\n \n\nhpc8FPDxCqI.jpg [https://pp.vk.me/c623329/v623329009/bcd/hpc8FPDxCqI.jpg]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120894-gondor-weapon-attachment/?do=findComment&comment=1244280","commentId":1244280,"userName":"GondorianFire","timestamp":1409689216,"content":"Wow MyNeighbourTrololo I like all 3 examples you gave.
