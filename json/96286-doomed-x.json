Here is the answer.\n\nIf you raise your threat for the doomed keyword, whether from a player card or encounter card, you have still raised your threat for the doomed keyword. Thus any effect that triggers \"after you raise your threat from the doomed keyword\" will trigger, regardless of the source of the doomed keyword.\n\nCheers,\n\nCaleb\n\nEdited January 6, 2014 by Tracker1"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/96286-doomed-x/?do=findComment&comment=952728","commentId":952728,"userName":"chuckles","timestamp":1389567506,"content":"Thanks for getting clarification. "}]}
