My question is: is the following move legal?\n\nI am in the Combat Phase with a Forest Spider engaged (it has 2 attacks since it is not it's first round). I decide the attack goes undefended. I flip its shadow card which adds +3 attack: instant death for any of my heroes.\n\nI have no shadow cancellation, no Feint, nor can I put the Spider back to the staging area. So I play Sneak Attack and put Gandalf into play. He instantly deals 4 damage to an enemy in play, which of course kills Forest Spider. Therefore I don't have to resolve its 5 attack. Hero saved.\n\nIs there a place to play Gandalf this way between flipping the shadow card and resolving the Spider's attack?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/273339-gandalf-saving-during-an-attack/?do=findComment&comment=3280648","commentId":3280648,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1523395583,"content":"Yes there is.
