The way in some art the background/foreground items fade. The way she brings in light/glare. Her representation/take of the characters is awsome and beter than what I could ever imagine from reading the books, even beter than the movies. Examples I adore is Gimli with armour chain mail, Legolas from core and the new Tactics Eowyn.\n\nMy all time top 3 favourite art cards:\nFrom best/most loved.\n\n1.

Running low doing the \"unseen strike\", very shortly after standing behind the target who has the blood spraying and her doing the move completion \"Ninja\" pose. \n\nBecause he never saw it coming, executed just like a ninja. \n\n \n\nBut I have to agree, the hair could have been done better. The artist obviously went for the fair elf hair look. I also feel it failed a bit.\n\nAlso don't care much for the white puffy sleeves, but the blades are nice. However I love the cards theme and atmosphere it creates for me.\n\n \n\nwhat do you think about the following piece Edheliad? \n\n \n\nffg_damrod-hon.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_damrod-hon.jpg]\n\nEdited May 14, 2016 by Mengel"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218859-favorite-art/?do=findComment&comment=2217641","commentId":2217641,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1463256514,"content":"I don't even like to use Resourceful tbh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/218859-favorite-art/?do=findComment&comment=2222556","commentId":2222556,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1463534876,"content":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Flight-of-the-Stormcaller/Raging-Squall.jpg [https://s3.amazonaws.com/hallofbeorn-resources/Images/Cards/Flight-of-the-Stormcaller/Raging-Squall.jpg]"}]}
