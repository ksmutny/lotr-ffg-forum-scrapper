But I have always been curious about his one!  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nMany thanks in advance."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123650-dunland-tribesman/?do=findComment&comment=1283698","commentId":1283698,"userName":"13nrv","timestamp":1412167745,"content":"You're right.\n\n \n\nIn your case and with 3 player, it would get +3 threat when the card is revealed.\n\n \n\nIf a second is revealed, the first get again +3 threat (for a total of +6) and the second get +3 threat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/123650-dunland-tribesman/?do=findComment&comment=1283794","commentId":1283794,"userName":"Chaos101","timestamp":1412173320,"content":"Thank you 13nrv.\n\n \n\nAlways good to know we have been playing it correctly!\n\n \n\nThanks again."}]}
