Reduce your threat by 1 every time this character participates in an attack that destroys an enemy would be amazing. I doubt it will be something like this even though the game has been needing some sort of threat reduction in tactics since the start. Regardless of ability I will be using this new ally as long as it has ranged instead of Westfold Outrider (the only real time I ever use Westfold's ability is against Bill Ferny and he can be easily dealt with in other ways) as ranged is amazing in two player/two handed and will also boost Rumil's ability.\n\nThe two cost lore silvan ally, Galadhrim Minstrel, has \"your deck for AN\" which means it can't be silvan ally or song, do you think this will be attachment, event or ally?\nNo idea what the spirit silvan ally will do...\nThoughts?\n\nI know I've started a few threads speculating on what new ring maker cycle cards will do but its all I can do while I wait for more spoilers and dunland trap to come out..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107382-other-two-silvan-two-cost-allies/?do=findComment&comment=1101386","commentId":1101386,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1401335805,"content":"It would make sense for the leadership recycling silvan event to give the player resources.  Maybe return a silvan ally then give a hero 2 resources, or they could even have u gain the number of resources that the ally costed which gives it a variable effect kind of how the tactics and spirit ones are.  Wouldnt be surprised if i'm wrong at all though.\n\n \n\nAllies are too hard to guess, i'll enjoy the surprise i suppose"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107382-other-two-silvan-two-cost-allies/?do=findComment&comment=1101395","commentId":1101395,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1401336525,"content":"Returning Rumil or Orophin to your hand to gain 4/3 resources would be pretty **** good, then you can play them again with those resources and trigger their enters play response again or use the resources for other cards obviously.

What do you think? It's technically resource generation, it's just a forced spend.\n\nAlso, the AN issue, 'search your deck for an.... ally with the silvan trait then blah blah'. It still could be silvan ally. I've seen cards with this wording layout before, I just can't remember which card. Mechanically I think it will be silvan ally. There aren't many yet and you'll need to get them early to start your 'bouncing' in and out of play trick.\n\nAs for the other allies, aside from the spheres core role, I have no idea at all.
