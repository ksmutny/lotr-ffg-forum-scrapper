Not only that: Sword that was Broken can be attached to him and its ability will be passed around between the players, which would be interesting.\n\nMy best guess for wording on Palantir:\n\nAttach to Fellowship Aragorn.\n\nQuesting Action: Exhaust Aragorn and Palantir of Orthanc to discard the top card of the encounter deck. If Aragorn's willpower is greater than the discarded card's threat, you may add Palantir of Orthanc to the victory display and remove it from the campaign pool to choose a player. That player reveals 1 less encounter card this phase (to a minimum of 0).\n\nIt's like a conditional Gildor's Counsel, but it specifies which player doesn't reveal the card (which is why I assume the minimum is 0 instead of 1). I assume that the choosing of the player is due to the fact that the encounter decks have started targeting the player that revealed the card instead of the entire group."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131359-something-interesting-about-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1399297","commentId":1399297,"userName":"Distractionbeast","timestamp":1420828039,"content":"This is not a worthless card at all.  It gives Aragorn a modified version of Denethor's ability.  When you activate it, you discard the top card of the encounter deck!  You only ditch the card if you wish to reduce the number of cards revealed.  There are a number of ways to view the top card of the encounter deck, which you can then selectively discard with Aragorn.  By itself, it's not as easy as Denethor, but it's a nice addition to Aragorn's own skills."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/131359-something-interesting-about-the-treason-of-saruman/?do=findComment&comment=1399445","commentId":1399445,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1420833348,"content":"> This is not a worthless card at all.  It gives Aragorn a modified version of Denethor's ability.  When you activate it, you discard the top card of the encounter deck!  You only ditch the card if you wish to reduce the number of cards revealed.  There are a number of ways to view the top card of the encounter deck, which you can then selectively discard with Aragorn.  By itself, it's not as easy as Denethor, but it's a nice addition to Aragorn's own skills.\n\n \n\nThat's a good point. We were looking at how the entire ability plays out, but it says we MAY add it to the victory display, so this is actually a very powerful way to simply discard encounter cards.
