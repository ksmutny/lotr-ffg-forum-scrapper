If you both want to fully enjoy the game, I'd recommend getting one core set each.\n\n \n\nOther than that, go along with the Shadows of Mirkwood cycle adventure packs to get a better card pool. Khazad-Dûm is heavy on dwarf cards, but there is something for everyone. The Dwarrowdelf cycle has some great hero and ally cards. Depending on what kinds of decks you want to try, you might want to look at different adventure packs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91298-just-starting-2-players/?do=findComment&comment=878357","commentId":878357,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1380561685,"content":"you can buy 1 core set between you and be fine. then you can of course buy 1 copy of each expansion after that.\n\n \n\ni do have 2 core sets but only bought the other after playing for 2 years. a far quicker way to expand your card pool effectively is to buy the expansions\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91298-just-starting-2-players/?do=findComment&comment=878373","commentId":878373,"userName":"Sephirex","timestamp":1380562608,"content":"Thanks for the responses! \n\n \n\nSounds like this will be cheaper than I'd planned."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91298-just-starting-2-players/?do=findComment&comment=878403","commentId":878403,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1380564782,"content":"There is www.cardgamedb.com [http://www.cardgamedb.com] in case you want to look up cards of a specific kind or sphere and plan what to buy, though that might take away some of the experience of collecting.

If you are trying to cut costs you can just build decks during your get together sessions and can rotate buying the expansion packs and be fine."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91298-just-starting-2-players/?do=findComment&comment=878440","commentId":878440,"userName":"Sephirex","timestamp":1380567163,"content":"We're both collector fanatics, and we'd already decided we'll be buying the cards separately to appease our completionist tendencies.  \n\n \n\nEither way, this is sounding quite doable, and since we'll be a quarantined play team we won't need to worry about keeping up with current releases."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91298-just-starting-2-players/?do=findComment&comment=878470","commentId":878470,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1380570563,"content":"It's a pretty affordable addiction.  I have every box and expansion pack there is for LOTR LCG and the total price is about the same as a single tier 1 deck of another popular CCG."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/91298-just-starting-2-players/?do=findComment&comment=878471","commentId":878471,"userName":"iznax","timestamp":1380570594,"content":"The way you approach the game is the best !
