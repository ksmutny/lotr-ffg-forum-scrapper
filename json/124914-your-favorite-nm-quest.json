Especially in 3/4p games because next to the regular questing and combat you need a certain amount of control to keep the Hunters from being immortally strong. I find it challenging with a lot of 'extras' the players want to perform to prevent entering a game that can't be won because the hunters are getting too strong.\n\nWe must Away Ere Break of Dawn is one I also like, but because of the mechanics I find it just a little bit harder as the normal version. There are some game mechanics that keep this quest to be relatively easy. Perhaps I should try it with another kind of deck, because now it is like Shadow and Flames. Choose the deck that kills it, and 3/4/5 rounds later you had an easy victory.\n\nNext to those I think I like them all. Escape from Dol Guldur and Over the Misty Mountains are the hardest ones in my experience."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1300296","commentId":1300296,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1413372717,"content":"I like the Dead Marsher and Foundation of Stone for the otherworldy things they offer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1300328","commentId":1300328,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1413375075,"content":"I beat nightmare over the misty mountains first go I'm pretty sure but have never beaten nightmare we must away.

Granted, if you don't like building a deck or decks for the specific quest in regular mode, then you won't like nightmare because it just doubles down on what makes it unique, but if you enjoyed it then I think you would enjoy the nightmare version. \n\n \n\nAlso, for my personal taste, it is just the right amount of difficulty. Not too easy so I don't feel challenged, but not too hard to the point of feeling cheap or frustrating based on how the cards are drawn. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1301491","commentId":1301491,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1413439242,"content":"Nightmare Seventh Level and then in a close second would be Nightmare Journey Down the Anduin and Nightmare Road to Rivendell."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1301496","commentId":1301496,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1413439461,"content":"Actually yeah Into the Pit is really really good as well."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124914-your-favorite-nm-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1301763","commentId":1301763,"userName":"Djenni","timestamp":1413465368,"content":"Very interesting!

Haven't gotten a chance to play through the Heirs of Numenor Nightmare quests yet, but I don't see them knocking off Journey as my favorite.

It's one of the encounter decks that really never gives up."}]}
