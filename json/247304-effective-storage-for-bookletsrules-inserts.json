My current setup is very inefficient, I throw all the folded pieces of paper in a large bag and call it a day. Same with the booklets. Throw them in a stack and slide them in.  Normally I would use PDF files for setup instructions, but with some PDFs marked at \"403 Forbidden\" and it not being up to date, I'm left to good 'ol paper. Not only that, the PDFs don't have the story bits. But with the way I store them, it's very hard to quickly find what I need haha.\n\nAnyone have any good ideas for an effective storage? Mine is clearly not up to the task. ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nSide note: It would be awesome to see FFG print a book that has every booklet/rules insert in one handy little tome.\n\nEdited April 15, 2017 by soullos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247304-effective-storage-for-bookletsrules-inserts/?do=findComment&comment=2734926","commentId":2734926,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1492321481,"content":"I put everything in a binder.

(I know nothing about the German versions). So far all the deluxe boxes I have are built the same way, with a lid that you lift off of the box (like 99% of board game boxes)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247304-effective-storage-for-bookletsrules-inserts/?do=findComment&comment=2738362","commentId":2738362,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1492535152,"content":"I put the sheets away, and I always use this with [http://lotr-lcg-quest-companion.com] my iPod or cell phone."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/247304-effective-storage-for-bookletsrules-inserts/?do=findComment&comment=2738696","commentId":2738696,"userName":"tyrion003","timestamp":1492546004,"content":"I use deluxe boxes without insert for encounter cards of wholy cycle, too, too and I was really surprised that Sands od Harad (English version) was the same as all the old ones.
