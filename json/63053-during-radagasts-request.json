Radagast isn't pay 1 to heal 1, he's pay X to heal X.\n\n \n\nSo yes, that can work if you manage to pull it off.

Indeed I agree Long defeat is useless to place on this particular quest stage, though it was handy when I played this adventure. I believe we did in fact clear Rhsogobel direct, with Asfaloth.\n\nHowever, putting that aside, in my group we almost always play Long Defeat onto side quests, which remains valid even during stage two here.\n\nHowever, I concede your point. Even if it worked well for me and is generally decent, it is likely not the best recommendation for this adventure."}]}
