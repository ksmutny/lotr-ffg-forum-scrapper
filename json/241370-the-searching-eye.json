I think the question boils down to whether exhausting some of my heroes counts as performing \"exhaust each hero you control\" in full."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241370-the-searching-eye/?do=findComment&comment=2617622","commentId":2617622,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1485850852,"content":"\"Exhaust\" can't happen to an already-exhausted character, so I would think that \"exhaust each hero\" can only be performed in full if all your heroes are ready."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/241370-the-searching-eye/?do=findComment&comment=2618401","commentId":2618401,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1485885228,"content":"> 9 hours ago, NathanH said:\n> \n> \"Exhaust\" can't happen to an already-exhausted character, so I would think that \"exhaust each hero\" can only be performed in full if all your heroes are ready.\n\nYeah, that's how I read it too.
