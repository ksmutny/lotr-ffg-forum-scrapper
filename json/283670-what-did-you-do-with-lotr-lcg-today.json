Basically, you state what you have done with the game. Did you play? If so, what quest and how did it go? Did you buy new expansions or adventure packs? Did you buy new sleeves? Did you re-organize your cards or working on a new storage/organizer solution? Anything that you did related to the game, you can share in this thread. I'm looking to create a thread that hopefully gets updated daily so we have something to read about every day. I'm curious to find out what you all do with Lotr LCG.\n\nTo start off, last night I built the encounter deck for the 2nd Khazad-dum quest, The Seventh Level.\n\nThis morning I ordered the On the Doorstep playmat from FFG. It should arrive next week. I might even hold off on playing the 2nd Khazad-dum quest until it arrives, since I'm using a Dwarf deck for the quests :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3487243","commentId":3487243,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1538172030,"content":"I replay the rhovanion deluxe in solo with a mono tactics deck.

I'm hoping Eowyn plus a few unique allies will be enough to successfully quest every round.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nNot today, but last Saturday I ended up playing the 2nd Khazad-dum quest, The Seventh Level. I am using a tri-sphere Dwarf deck with Dain, Bifur and Gimli. I got the deck from RingsDB and tweaked it to remove non-thematic cards like Steward of Gondor, Daughter of Nimrodel, etc... It was a really fun play through. I won on my first try, but just barely. The 2nd stage of the quest does a good job of simulating a horde of Goblins/Orcs coming at you while you try to make your escape. There was a stretch of 2-3 rounds where I had 3 engaged enemies and not enough bodies to block them. Dain can block at least twice because I had Erebor Record Keeper in play and I had Veteran of Nanduhirion to block the 3rd enemy. However I only had Gimli to kill off the enemies. Thankfully I had Feints and Sneak Attack on my hand and somehow, managed to fend off the enemy. Some attacks I took undefended and Dain would have been dead, if he didn't have Self Preservation on him. I was extremely lucky to not  have faced the Cave Trolls as they all showed up as Shadow cards.\n\nAt 47 threat, with 3 engaged enemies, I used Sneak Attack to bring in another Veteran of Nanduhirion to block an enemy, instead of Feint, so I would have one more attacker in addition to Gimli. Using Sneak Attack triggered Legacy of Durin and the card I drew was Gandalf! I was so happy since I was worried I was going to threat out, not to mention the horde of enemies kept coming. I now realize that I would have drawn him anyway in the next round but during that time, I was ecstatic LOL. With Gandalf in play, I was finally able to win the game.\n\nEdited October 1, 2018 by Finch204\ntypo"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3488984","commentId":3488984,"userName":"Gandalf_","timestamp":1538409215,"content":"Another day failing to track down a copy of the Black Riders.. oh well.. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3489076","commentId":3489076,"userName":"Stewart777","timestamp":1538413561,"content":"> 1 hour ago, Gandalf_ said:\n> \n> Another day failing to track down a copy of the Black Riders.. oh well.. \n\nThere's one for 37 pounds (including shipping) here on BGG [https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/2064221/looking-buy-black-riders-expansion]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3489706","commentId":3489706,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1538452424,"content":"Played a tense game of Nightmare Drowned Ruins last night, thought I might lose from threat but managed to pull out a victory in the end.

Dain with Self Preservation held him off for a few rounds, but I just did not have enough attacking power to take it down as there were other enemies I was engaged with. At 49 threat, I knew I was gonna lose, I focused on taking down the Cave Troll before the end. I played two Khazad! Khazad! cards on Gimli, who already had 4 damage tokens on him and he was able to take out the Cave Troll in one blow. Of course I failed the quest after the combat phase.\n\nMy problem with this quest seems to be clearing locations. I don't have enough Dwarves available for combat, because I have to let them quest. At most, I am just barely keeping up with questing. I am going to see if I can make improvements to my deck before I move on to the last Khazad-dum quest."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3504051","commentId":3504051,"userName":"Stewart777","timestamp":1539617486,"content":"We need 4 heroes per player :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]\n\nEdited October 15, 2018 by Stewart777"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3504332","commentId":3504332,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1539629350,"content":"Yesterday, I found time to play LotR LCG for the first time in a year (my previous game was on October 13, 2017, vs. Escape from Mount Gram... couldn't believe that much time had passed)!\n\nMan did it ever feel good to get back to the game.\n\nI played Across the Ettenmoors 2-handed progression style and won on first try, so I was very pleased with that.

Everyone else might be doing this already, but for some reason I never thought of doing it this way. I've always built decks by adding cards that I like or cards that fit a theme I like, regardless of what pack/expansion/cycle they come from. So now, I'm going to try building decks by first looking at cards that belong to the pack/expansion/cycle whose quest I am going to be playing. So like for the Khazad-dum quests, I rebuilt my deck by first looking at Khazad-dum cards, which also meant that they almost always fit the theme of the quest, selecting those that I like to play. Then I looked at cards from the Core se and picked those that I liked. Then only then did I look at cards belonging to other unrelated packs/expansions/cycle. I feel like this results in a deck that is more suited to playing the quest at hand, which I guess is why people like playing progression style.\n\nAnyway, looking forward to playing the last Khazad-dum quest soon."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3540409","commentId":3540409,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1542643175,"content":"Finally played A Storm on Cobas Haven and City of Corsairs.

I had Rumour from the Earth in my hand for the start of the game. Things were looking good. I knew what the top card was on the encounter deck and was ready for the staging step. On Round 1, I revealed the Narrow Paths quest card. I didn't make any questing progress on Round 1, so I didn't get to trigger the forced effect, I thought I would make it a priority on the next round. Dain defended against a Stray Goblin and Gimli managed to do inflict 1 damage on it. Before the round ended, I played Rumour from the Earth again and knew that the next card coming was a location with 1 threat. I was feeling good.\n\nSo on to Round 2, I decided to quest with Bifur and Gimli for a total of 6 willpower. Staging step revealed the location which had 1 threat. The location plus The Nameless Fear had a total of 3 threat, so I quested successfully and proceeded to place the progress token on the quest card, which triggered the forced effect. Since the Abandoned Tools had the Guarded keyword, I ended up revealing Sudden Pitfall! Ouch. Now I had the fun decision of deciding which hero to discard, Bifur or Gimli. I decided to discard Bifur. Now I finish putting all progress tokens on the quest card and realized I completely finished that part of the quest, so now it gets to go to the victory display to add to The Nameless Fear's threat. At this early in the game, round 2, losing Bifur was a huge blow and I conceded at that point. Sauron wins again this time.\n\nHowever I now have a good feeling that I can beat this quest soon. I just need to be wary of the Sudden Pitfall treachery card when questing. I had Erebor Record Keeper in play on Round 2, but decided to quest with Gimli instead, which was a big mistake. Should not be making that mistake next time.\n\nEdited December 31, 2018 by Finch204"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3579969","commentId":3579969,"userName":"TheSpitfired","timestamp":1546429151,"content":"Happy 2019!\n\nIt may not sound like much, but last night while I had some downtime at work and decided to challenge myself to the \"play 10 games 10 times in a year\" challenge. \n\nI haven't played since a Fellowship event in October, so I put this game on the list.

Beregond is another big part since it's the usual uber-defender of the table, while Elrond's ability to boost healing is unvaluable in helping clear all the damage spread around. We also often found Legolas ability to add progress outside the quest phase to be amazing since it lets us advance of stage during the combat phase avoiding some of the biggest troubles the encounter deck can throw at us so we preferred him as the main ranged attacker to other choices. The traps are also quite the big part of our play since they can provide quite the wide range of advantages. Furthermore using mono-sphere decks lets us use resources more freely and we can more easily afford \"big\" cards, not to mention some possibile only on mono-sphere (like Strenght of Arms which often can end up readying like 15-20 characters, or Advance Warning, not to mention Shadows Give Way which often ended up saving our butts even outside of Carn Dum).

I don't think I even used Vilya at all in the Elrond fellowship deck, just relied on him to be a solid second defender. In straight solo, I felt that the deck I used with Faramir/Erestor/Glorfindel was better as it was able to build Faramir into a mega battle quester/defender/wrecking ball much more effectively (using Songs, Love of Tales, Blood of Gondor, Gondorian Fire, Steward of Gondor, A Burning Brand, Miruvor, Unexpected Courage, Lembas, Wingfoot, etc., and striving to break even on questing in order to keep Accursed Battlefield as the active location as long as possible until I was ready to rush into and through Stage 2). \n\nI had never used hero Faramir before Carn Dum, and man was it a pleasure to discover just how awesome he is in battle quests (especially with Song of Kings/Steward of Gondor/Gondorian Fire attached), when enemies accumulate in staging due to ranger spikes and/or high engagement costs. \n\nBut you are right regarding Erestor... while he was awesome for quickly putting into play low-cost attachments, he frequently got me into trouble as a result of treacheries forcing me to discard multiple/all copies of Will of the West and other key cards into the discard pile and/or Power of Angmar making it impossible to reshuffle or otherwise pull cards from the player discard pile. Still, I really liked the way he comboed with both Faramir and Glorfindel.   \n\nEdited March 1, 2019 by TwiceBorn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3637324","commentId":3637324,"userName":"Vermithrax","timestamp":1551453028,"content":"First deck i built for Carn Dum was with Faramir.  You have an enemy that won't leave the staging area so you start out with a stronger Faramir.  I may have to go back and try him against that quest again.  Funny enough I just finished Conflict at the Carrock (Nightmare) and that one also has enemies parked in the staging area.  I might have to go back to that one and try Faramir again.  I just want to make him work."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3637421","commentId":3637421,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1551458673,"content":"That's the beauty of Elrond.

I just left all enemies in the staging area as the questing deck could still over-power the threat, meaning I could draw lots of cards with Beravor for the questing deck and Peace and Thought for the combat deck as I didn't need the combat deck at all early. This allowed me to draw the 3rd Galadrim's Greetings, Celebrian's Stone, and Dwarven Tomb. After using those tricks, I advanced to stage 3 during round 6 and Durin's Bane hadn't even attacked yet (the staging area had 4 or 5 low threat goblins, but I could quest for 15+ using only the questing deck so I just left them there). In stage 3, Durin's Bane obliterated a few allies including some eagles (which got tucked under The Eagles of the Misty Mountain to bump their attack to 5). The Misty Mountain Eagles (attacking for 5), Beravor (with Support of the Eagles attacking for 7), a couple Trollshaw Scouts, Gimli, Legolas, and Radagast chipping in made quick work of the Big Guy in only 2 rounds.\n\nI can't imagine ever getting so lucky as to completely avoid all attacks for the first 5 rounds again, but it was a glorious conclusion to the Darrowdelf cycle.\n\nI love dem birbs... \n\nEdited March 3, 2019 by PickleTheHutt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/283670-what-did-you-do-with-lotr-lcg-today/?do=findComment&comment=3638814","commentId":3638814,"userName":"mewmartigan","timestamp":1551662866,"content":"Opened and sleeved my haul from the latest restock including the last 3 Saga expansions I needed.\n\nAlso noticed today that I seem to be missing the first 3 Quest cards for The Lonely Mountain.

It’s very fun!\n\nLastly, I had another friend ask if I could build a deck with his favorite character, Prince Imrahil. I tried to make a Gondor deck but it just didn’t work. Maybe it paired with a high questing deck it would be fine but I took it apart to make the Hobbit deck.\n\nTrying to decide if I jump back into where I was quest-wise (khazad-dum) or if I jump into the sagas.

In my Spirit/Lore Elf Deck, Gildor and a few other cards were removed for the ally sons of Elrond and more threat reduction. In the Hobbit/Ent Support deck (Hobbit heroes, ally Treebeard) Rosie Cotton and Quickbeam moved in and found their spots kept nice and warm. Lastly in my Spirit/Tactics Rohan deck, Theoden went from Tactics to Spirit and added Herugrim. Now we're ready.\n\nIn my first unconventional test run, I took the Elves on a Journey Down the Anduin. I wanted to see if they could handle that massive Hill Troll and see how all the new elements of the deck played together. This quest - the Hill Troll intimidates me but otherwise I find it a lot of fun and a good challenge. A perfect place to try out my new ideas.\n\nMuch to my surprise and satisfaction they absolutely crushed it! A Goblin Sniper came into the staging area early very early, but the Elves were ready. With very careful resource management, threat reduction and a lucky early healer draw, our heroes defeated the Hill Troll. Then came the fun. A second Goblin Sniper entered the staging area as we began phase 2. Even worse, the next two enemies were the wargs, the ones that go back to the staging area when there isn't a shadow effect on its shadow card. With a constant threat of 5  before draw the pressure was on! However the deck kept everything under control, reducing threat to under 20 and utilizing a timely arrival by Gandalf to kill a Goblin Sniper. When I got to stage 3 there were (only) 6 enemies in the staging area. One by one the foes went down and victory was claimed. I lost count of how many turns it took but my final threat was at 17!\n\nThanks for bearing with me in my excitement, I don't beat that quest solo very often!"}]}
