I was going to make a Kin Strife quest, where you pick either side of Castamir or Eldacar (or third neutral side, which I was going to take out of my head lol), and by siding with one of them, you get an unique objective ally and attachment belonging to the side you chose, and remove all enemies and treacheries belonging to the side you chose from the encounter deck. Meaning the game experience varies greatly depending on the people you side with. Not so much of mechanic, though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114083-rulebending-the-art-of-making-pretzels/?do=findComment&comment=1214377","commentId":1214377,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1408546834,"content":"There was a lot of idea around \"location\" played by players, the ideas were very broad, so there was a lot of different mechanics involved.\n\nYou can see some there :\n\nhttp://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?hl=haven [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?hl=haven]\n\nhttp://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106461-a-mechanic-i-would-really-like-to-see/?hl=haven#entry1088069 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106461-a-mechanic-i-would-really-like-to-see/?hl=haven#entry1088069]\n\nhttp://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106418-cool-idea-for-the-next-cycle/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106418-cool-idea-for-the-next-cycle/]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/114083-rulebending-the-art-of-making-pretzels/?do=findComment&comment=1214385","commentId":1214385,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1408547001,"content":"> There was a lot of idea around \"location\" played by players, the ideas were very broad, so there was a lot of different mechanics involved.\n> \n> You can see some there :\n> \n> http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?hl=haven [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106575-custom-haven-cards/?hl=haven]\n> \n> http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106461-a-mechanic-i-would-really-like-to-see/?hl=haven#entry1088069 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106461-a-mechanic-i-would-really-like-to-see/?hl=haven#entry1088069]\n> \n> http://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106418-cool-idea-for-the-next-cycle/ [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/106418-cool-idea-for-the-next-cycle/]\n\nI had \"sort of location\" cards in my custom Esgaroth expansions.
