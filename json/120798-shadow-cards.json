Any shadow cards dealt to the attacking enemy \nare discarded after the attack resolves.\n \n(1.42) Additional attacks by an enemy\nWhen an enemy makes an additional attack, discard all \nof its previously dealt shadow cards before dealing it a \nnew shadow card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/120798-shadow-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1240453","commentId":1240453,"userName":"Eldainorn","timestamp":1409495488,"content":"Thank you kind sir. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] "}]}
