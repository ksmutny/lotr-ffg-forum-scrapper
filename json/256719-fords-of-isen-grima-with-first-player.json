However, I thought I read there's a distinction between similar wording, where at times such an objective-ally doesn't follows the first player.\n\nIf so, what is it?

If there is a one-time effect that give them (probably \"when revealed\", a \"response\" or \"forced\") then the control will not change.\n\nFor example: http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Hidden-Way-HoN [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR/Details/The-Hidden-Way-HoN]\n\nIf this is a passive effect it is always checked so when first player change objective move around too.
