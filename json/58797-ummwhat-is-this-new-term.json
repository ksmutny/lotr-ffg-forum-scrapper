It certainly is not covered in the little 3 page explanation of the deluxe expansion and it isn't in the core set rulebook. What is a \"Victory Display\" ?\n\nMaybe I am just ignorant and am missing something somewhere but I am unfamiliar with the term. I am guessing it is a place where your completed quests are shown or maybe a place where you splay out the victory points you have defeated so far?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58797-ummwhat-is-this-new-term/?do=findComment&comment=577806","commentId":577806,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1326242327,"content":"I haven't got Kaz yet, I havn't read the new rules or anything... but I is it talking about the area out of play that you place cards with victory points?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58797-ummwhat-is-this-new-term/?do=findComment&comment=577814","commentId":577814,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1326243145,"content":"It's the place where you put cards with victory points. When you defeat an enemy or explore a location that is worth victory points, it doesn't go to the encounter discard pile, it goes to the victory display. Think of it as a victory pile."}]}
