When the first adventure pack arrives you can play it without having have to wait for others.\n\n2. The limit is 3 cards of the same name in a deck.

They're not supposed to all go in the same deck if you're playing with the decks straight out of the box without customization.\n\nAs far as the quests go, you can build a deck that'll beat it out of one base set, I think. You just won't be able to do it sticking to one of the spheres - you have to customize a bit.\n\nThe third quest is a bear - it's extremely difficult to beat solo in any event because of the way it's set up, as the opening quest card is fairly crippling for a solo player. It's possible, but you have to have a tuned deck (probably from multiple sets), get a lucky deal, and make few to no mistakes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47575-cards/?do=findComment&comment=477346","commentId":477346,"userName":"signoftheserpent","timestamp":1306818453,"content":"Is there any truth in this, [http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?576706-Lord-of-the-Rings-LCG&p=13929005#post13929005]which claims Leadership to be overpowered?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47575-cards/?do=findComment&comment=477381","commentId":477381,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1306822330,"content":"signoftheserpent said:\n\nIs there any truth in this, [http://forum.rpg.net/showthread.php?576706-Lord-of-the-Rings-LCG&p=13929005#post13929005]which claims Leadership to be overpowered?\n\n\n\nI don't know if it is overpowered but it is sure the best sphere so far.Aragorn is the best hero.You can quest very well with Faramir,you can have as resources as you want with Steward of Gondor and is the only sphere which you can use cards from an other sphere even if you use only leadership heroes(Celebrian's stone)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47575-cards/?do=findComment&comment=477407","commentId":477407,"userName":"Bohemond2","timestamp":1306824467,"content":"Actually, if we use the Quest tracker, you can see that Spirit is slightly edging out Leadership as the most played sphere (31.14% to 30.84%).  And Aragorn has lost his status as most played hero.  He is seeing play in 39% of all decks.  Eowyn has the top spot, and takes the field in a whopping 46.92% of all decks.  So, the community doesn't see leadership as \"broken\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47575-cards/?do=findComment&comment=477423","commentId":477423,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1306826528,"content":"signoftheserpent said:\n\n\n\nOk this doesn't at all sound like good value for money.\n\n \n\n \n\nWhy would the other two quests (making one that's really easy may sound great for tutorial purposes, but it sounds like a waste of money to me - if it's that easy there's no replay value).

The reason Gandalf is included 4 times is because the game brings 4 different starter decks and the idea is that you put one Gandalf in each. This is really directed more at people who want to play cooperative. For solo, it doesn't really matter, as you will more likely play one deck and put 3 Gandalfs in it. \n\nThe second quest can be done solo, many players, myself included, have passed it multiple times. It is tough, but far from impossible. The third quest, is almost impossible to pass solo with the current card pool, and was probably designed primarily as a coop scenario. As for the first, you are right, the replay value of it is limited. You can pass it with the starter decks, something that is almost impossible to do with the other scenarios.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47575-cards/?do=findComment&comment=477429","commentId":477429,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1306827000,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nActually, if we use the Quest tracker, you can see that Spirit is slightly edging out Leadership as the most played sphere (31.14% to 30.84%).  And Aragorn has lost his status as most played hero.  He is seeing play in 39% of all decks.  Eowyn has the top spot, and takes the field in a whopping 46.92% of all decks.  So, the community doesn't see leadership as \"broken\"\n\n\n\nLeadership isn't broken, but it sure has a lot of good cards. I think Aragorn, good card though it may be, gets really hurt by his high threat. If you want to use leadership, Theodred and his resource acceleration is probably a better choice with a much smaller threat. Even Gloin, can be used very effectively, and also has a significantly lower threat."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47575-cards/?do=findComment&comment=477434","commentId":477434,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1306827250,"content":"Bohemond said:\n\nActually, if we use the Quest tracker, you can see that Spirit is slightly edging out Leadership as the most played sphere (31.14% to 30.84%).  And Aragorn has lost his status as most played hero.  He is seeing play in 39% of all decks.  Eowyn has the top spot, and takes the field in a whopping 46.92% of all decks.  So, the community doesn't see leadership as \"broken\"\n\n\n\nI think this is happening cause most people create their decks to have better scores and easier wins at he 2 scenario.Scenario 2 i think is the most enjoyable for solo play.It is not so easy as the first and not so hard as the third.Because of the hill troll most people try heroes with lower starting threat to avoid the troll as long as they can until the build their army of allys thats why Aragorn lost his status as the most played hero.Also Eowyn and spirit is the best combination for 2 scenario and especialy for 2b card.\n\nI can't speak for all but i think this is the major reason.Others can tell if i am right or it is just my idea.\n\n "}]}
