The sniper cannot be optionally engaged if there is another enemy in the staging area.\n\n \n\nIf there is one other enemy in the staging area can one player engage the other enemy then the second player engage the goblin sniper now that there is no other enemy in the staging area? Or can the second player not engage the goblin because there is another enemy in the area at the start of the engagement phase?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74408-goblin-sniper/?do=findComment&comment=866938","commentId":866938,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1379275010,"content":"Since engagement is done one player at a time, that would work fine.  As long as there are no enemies in the staging area when it is your turn to make an optional engagement, you can engage the sniper.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74408-goblin-sniper/?do=findComment&comment=867016","commentId":867016,"userName":"cyberlettuce","timestamp":1379281149,"content":"Ah that makes it slightly easier, thanks for the confirmation grandspleen"}]}
