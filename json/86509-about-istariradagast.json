He is too expensive 5 cost and no one really play him. I think is wrong. Radagast should be very cool characters like a Gandalf but different way! Should be cool to have some kind of Animals deck with Radagast  or something.....FFG really make big mess here......\n\n \n\nIn ME ccg Radagast, Gandalf, Saruman, Pallando very cool mages and each of them powerfull in his way!

I do wish his healing ability was better though - 1 for 1 cost is no good (as shown by Lore Glorfindel). I think I'd prefer it if he had \"Response: you can spend resources from Radagast's pool to increase a stat of a creature card you control\". That would make him +1 defense instead of 1 hit point (also allows creatures to quest better if used for willpower).\n\nI think that change would easily justify his cost even if you had only a few creatures (instead of the eagle theme).\n\nAlthough I could also see Radagast getting a rework to explore a different area of the character.

You can tutor for any card off him, that is pretty cool. His abilities are not that interesting.. but we could see more creatures come, though there isn't a huge amount of room in LoTR for them to make things up. I'm no expert on the source but what else is there really that he could trigger? More eagles, more horses? Ents shouldn't be creatures. Spiders are bad guys... I dunno.. just doesn't seam much room for this card. The real problem is that his heal is next to useless, as most creatures have 1 health anyway.\n\n \n\nStill Word of Command works very well with him and there is a chance he will improve.. but I think the most lilky thing will be that we will simply see a powercreep print of him that will basically replace him in any given situation."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86509-about-istariradagast/?do=findComment&comment=818064","commentId":818064,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1374316935,"content":"I've used him to heal Gollum in Return to Mirkwood before now - that's always been quite handy..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86509-about-istariradagast/?do=findComment&comment=818079","commentId":818079,"userName":"rekath16","timestamp":1374320387,"content":"> I've used him to heal Gollum in Return to Mirkwood before now - that's always been quite handy...\n\ninteresting.."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86509-about-istariradagast/?do=findComment&comment=818086","commentId":818086,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1374326043,"content":"Radagast + King of Morthond could be interesting.
