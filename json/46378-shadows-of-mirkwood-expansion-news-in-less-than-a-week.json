I believe there was an earlier thread doing the same before mine, couldn't find it mind. I also did a thread here [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=480369] about the storyline of the first quest set from the Tolkien novels. Note there are spoilers if you haven't read the books before (as there would be).\n\nI have played a CCG game before this one, quite a while ago (the Decipher Star Wars one) but really got disillusioned with the expense of the game, especially trying to get a complete set including rares. After about the third set I dropped out. I had other things to spend my money on. I have two big Sci-Fi/Fantasy hobbies - Star Wars and LOTR - so when I saw this set (very late tbh) I knew I'd buy into it, especially since there are no rares, just complete sets. The co-operative side to the game is a big like, but the other plus side is the solo play - that sealed the deal.\n\nI can't wait for the next expansion really, hunting down Gollum, that is really really cool, especially with the fact it's something from the books.  \n\nThis is going to be a good year for LOTR fans - not only do we have this card game - there will be a RPG by Cubicle 7 called \"The One Ring\" and there is a Heroclix collection upcoming later this year from Wizkids. Life is good, if you are from Middle Earth lol."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46378-shadows-of-mirkwood-expansion-news-in-less-than-a-week/?do=findComment&comment=465436","commentId":465436,"userName":"DrNate","timestamp":1304884567,"content":" I spent too much money on Star Wars CCG. Looking back, making some of the rare cards 1 in every 121 rares is total madness. Compared to that, forking over 30-40 dollars for a second or third copy of the core set is highly reasonable.  And I doubt that FFG is losing money by making their product non-random. In hindsight, mystery boosters just seem greedy. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46378-shadows-of-mirkwood-expansion-news-in-less-than-a-week/?do=findComment&comment=468788","commentId":468788,"userName":"gmerwin2","timestamp":1305464496,"content":"Amazon is showing preorder and relesae date of June 30, 2011.  Bummer, I thought the first AP was due out end of this month!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/46378-shadows-of-mirkwood-expansion-news-in-less-than-a-week/?do=findComment&comment=468816","commentId":468816,"userName":"Toqtamish","timestamp":1305468423,"content":"It should be as the normal structure of releases is 1 per month. With usually a one month break in between each cycle and the occasional large expansion added in. But there was a big delay with the break between the Brotherhood with Banners and Secrets of Oldtown expansions ending and starting for Game of Thrones due to some issue on the printers end so it might have effected LotR as well maybe.
