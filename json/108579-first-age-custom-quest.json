You need to make the cards short enough to be easily digestible but clear enough to make sense. This is why keywords play such a important role. A single keyword can conveys a series of instructions. Like Surge == Reveal a new card form the encounter deck\" You see this in most armature card designs like Trollo's for example and if you spend any time playing the 100s of customs sets... wordy cards is a mega problem. I know my own custom cads also can have this kind of problem.\n\n \n\nAll in all I have gone though this set and think it is a worthy addition to the custom scene. I like the quests, and especially like how they have gone for a setting that is separated from the real game. Its size is unusually I think it is the 2nd digest set released. My guess is that they will expand this set with expansions and the game will basically become a new version, unrelated to FFG's game.

Nightmare packs are like kindergarden compared to First Age quests. I got crashed on two of them (did not tried the first one since the deck I made on OCTGN had Finrod in it), but loved all  of them. Very nice encounter cards, very nice scenarios, very very difficult (more than 10 difficulty IMO). I tried a deck based on Finrod, Finglofin and Beren, while I was questing good, and Fingolfin with his shield was a great defender, I did not manage to have good attack power, mainly cause the quests where giving me a very hard time and did not have the resources to deploy the cards the way I wanted.

The quests are definitely quite difficult, but are eventually beatable once you get the hang of everything (to give you an idea, I designed the things, and I still lose pretty often!). \n\n \n\nThere will definitely be some more quests and player cards on the way. I'm designing the first \"expansion\" right now, and I hope to have it out around Octoberish. \n\n \n\nAs for the pit area, the gist is that the players can choose one hero to be placed there at the start of a game. Whoever gives up that hero may immediately replace that hero and adjust their starting threat accordingly. That area is off limit for player cards, similar to the riddle area in the Dungeons Deep quest. When the counters run out on Eyes in the Dark, the Devouring Werewolf is placed into the pit area and engages in combat with the hero in the pit and Finrod objective. If the hero placed there is destroyed, then you lose. \n\n \n\nIf you haven't checked out, give a look at the First Age rules [http://talesfromthecards.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/first-age-rules.pdf], which explains some of the stuff in more detail.

They used to seem hard, but once you know the cards they're extremely easy. Last time I fought Morgoth instead of winning I decided to kill every single enemy worth victory points and capture most treacheries under Caranthir. Encounter deck didn't even try to fight back. Scenarios are still fun, but it would be nice too feel Morgoth's might once more"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1799536","commentId":1799536,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1442430058,"content":"It's an interesting thought, thanks! Right now, I'm neck deep in designing the Doom Mastered cycle, and should have the 2nd quest out in the next couple of weeks. That alone, in addition to other LOTR LCG stuff, takes up most of the limited free time I have. That being said, I'm definitely not against the idea and would love to do it if I can ever free up some time. So I guess my short answer is \"Not anytime soon\", but \"Potentially in the future\"! Sooner if I can recruit a fellow First Age designer or two, which may be a good idea anyway to get these things out faster."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1799662","commentId":1799662,"userName":"koriakin97","timestamp":1442432629,"content":"I checked some cards in Polish translation and there is one mistake- Thingol in his rule has House of Finarfin (Ród Finarfina) instead of House of Feanor (Ród Feanora)\n\n \n\nEdit: I found another two. Idril returns ally of up to X cost (o koszcie co najwyżej X) instead of ally of X cost (o koszcie co najwyżej X). And Caranthir has in his action -1 attack instead of +1 attack. I hope it doesn't sound like I don't like it, it's the best player-made expansion I ever played\n\nEdited September 16, 2015 by koriakin97"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1799713","commentId":1799713,"userName":"Slothgodfather","timestamp":1442433815,"content":"Thank you Koriakin for bumping this thread as I would have never seen it!    I skimmed through the cards, mostly looking at the heroes, and am blown away be the effort and detail that went into this.  Very awesome job Raven!  I must say it is driving me nuts trying to remember where I know the art for Curufin for.   I keep almost picturing it but just can't quite remember it well enough to identify.  I'm nearly certain it comes from a movie... Egypt for certain...  HA!   Stargate!   fantastic.\n\n \n\nI'm curious what program you used to create your output file with the crop marks though.   Does your source art include any excess bleed?  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/108579-first-age-custom-quest/?do=findComment&comment=1799797","commentId":1799797,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1442435431,"content":"Thanks koriakin, I'm glad you enjoy the First Age expansion! I will contact the Polish translator and see about fixing those errors.\n\n \n\nSlothgodfather, thanks for your kind words as well! I use Strange Eons to make pretty much everything, including the cards themselves and the PDF printables.

After 5 attempts managed to beat the quest just in time -prisoner Finrod was already gone, my hero was 1 damage away from being destroyed. I tried to be a bit thematic. Thus i had Beren, Luthien and then my most loved one, the valiant high king of Noldor, Fingolfin who faught bravely against the werewolfs and Sauron, till Thorondor, Huan, Azaghal and others made him flee.\n\nCan't express how happy i am to have these cards, i am a fan of sillmarillion and all these heroes are my favourites.\n\nThanks again raven\n\nPS: Just a question. There is no way i can attack the devouring werewolf right? He is in the pit thus i cannot declare attackers against him isn't it? Also, does he contribute his threat in the questing phase?"}]}
