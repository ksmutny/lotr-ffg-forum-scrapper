It's just a matter of them coming out as the game grows. Might even get attachment heavy expansions of some kind, like an Armory Pack to increase the potency of Heroes.

I would often be sitting with Theoden's sword in my hand for instance, just waiting to finally draw Theoden so I could play it. The point you make is a good one...the characters that you want to play \"unique\" weapons on will already be in play, so all you have to do is pop the weapon on him or her. \n\nTo be fair, I like the option of playing any item on any character (with a bonus given to specific bearers; for instance Celebrian's Stone pumps up even more on Aragorn, or Dwarf Axe on a dwarf, however, what happens when they release Narsil and I am allowed to equip it to Legolas? That just seems weird to me really.  Unique items seem natural and they are not restricting in the broader sense if you accept the fact that in any deck certain cards are always going to be left out until another game; thus, if I am playing Aragorn in my fellowship, I will play my copy of Narsil; if Legolas, then I will play \"Legolas's Bow,\" if Frodo/Bilbo then Sting...the list goes on indefinitely really. This is just one opinion. I like character specific unique items as an option; it stays true to the actual story. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52690-where-are-all-the-weapons/?do=findComment&comment=524544","commentId":524544,"userName":"Bonus Card","timestamp":1315258410,"content":"ClydeCloggie said:\n\nDurinIII said:\n\n \n\n A good observation Marlow.

However, the attachments that do exist should be more restrictive. For example, you can have a hero with Protector of Lorien, Song of Whatever, Unexpected Courage...and have 0 restrictions. So, add a SoG and Citadel Plate and that hero is now a walking battle-tank that spits out mutli-colored resource tokens.\n\nMaybe they should change the Attachment titles to something like Equipment(where any character can only have 1), and Title(a la Steward of Gondor, and limit that to 1 as well).\n\nThis would also encourage people to put more attachments on allies.
