Or can the across-the-table-exhaustion even work? \n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85124-word-of-command%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=803765","commentId":803765,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1371241671,"content":"That kind of cross-table work isn't allowed.  Exhausting a character to pay for cards is considered a cost, and you have to pay for cost with your own resources."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85124-word-of-command%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=803786","commentId":803786,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1371251095,"content":"Okay, thanks for that clarification. "}]}
