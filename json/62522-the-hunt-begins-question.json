On 1b, the Forced effect states: \"After the players quest succesfully, the first player looks at the top 3 cards of the encounter deck. Reveal and add 1 of those cards to the staging area, and discard the other 2 cards.\"\n\nMy question is if I can add a treachery card to the staging area instead of a location/enemy card? The cards I drew were Hunters from Mordor, Evil Storm, and The East Bank. Since my threat is low, I would rather deal with the Evil Storm than either of the other 2 cards. Just wanting to clarify to make sure I'm playing that correctly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62522-the-hunt-begins-question/?do=findComment&comment=612023","commentId":612023,"userName":"Doom1502","timestamp":1333166667,"content":"Of course you can. Effectless treachery cards are your best friends in this scenario, since you want to avoid the hunters as often as possible."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62522-the-hunt-begins-question/?do=findComment&comment=612027","commentId":612027,"userName":"Cotillion37","timestamp":1333166975,"content":"Awesome, thanks! I figured that was the case but I figured I should double check."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/62522-the-hunt-begins-question/?do=findComment&comment=612275","commentId":612275,"userName":"Rashley","timestamp":1333259095,"content":"Take every bit of help you can get!  You will need this advantage to find 'Clues' and avoid those vicious Hunters.  The 2nd part also helps but you choose 1 from only 2 and at the start of the Quest Phase.  This whole scenario boils down to finding 'Clues' but avoiding 'Hunters'.  Enjoy!  Cheers!"}]}
