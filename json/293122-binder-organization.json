Assuming you separate by sphere in your binder do most of you guys organize in alphabetical order or by set release within each sphere? It's just that with so many cards if you get a new pack you have to take out a bunch of cards to get the new ones in there if you sort alphabetically but if you sort by set release then it's harder to find stuff when deck building.
