this new hero's ability can, at most, only put in two Spirit allies that had previously died.  I find that to be extremely underwhelming.   The art is cool and I guess FFG is trying to round out their hero pool with more females (albeit madeup ones) but I am thoroughly unimpressed with this one's ability.\n\n \n\nHopefully the player cards and the quest itself are nice, though!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88541-spoiler-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=840642","commentId":840642,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1376581026,"content":"Indeed,

more I think about her the more i dislike her.  You need to have 3 spirit heroes to even entertain the thought of using the ability otherwise you are just swapping one character for another except you will have wrecked your score and limited the number of resources you gain each turn.  So at best you are adding +1 character and still wrecking your score and limiting the number of resources each turn.  Also as it stands there are no outstanding spirit allies who this could even be used on.  Its not like its lore where they have Gildor or tactics with Beorn whom are practically the equivallent of having another hero.  Your best options are a few 4 cost allies like Elfhelm, Damrod, or Northern Tracker.  As if that wasnt bad enough, those allies need to be in your discard pile first so since there are so few enocunter cards that discard cards from your deck you either need to discard them willingly yourself (which if you're running spirit i think you are limited to Eowyn for this effect) or having them die in combat...something you will likely try to avoid if possible with 4 cost allies.\n\n \n\nUnless her threat level, willpower, or atk are amazing i'd like to change my opinion from \"meh\" to terrible\""},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88541-spoiler-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=840665","commentId":840665,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1376582319,"content":">

How many games are there where you would quest with a hero that also has 3 attack 8 times? Spirit Glorfindel would in my opinion still be the best hero by an absolute mile without Light of Valinar, which is just broken on him.\n\nSo broken that I feel spirit Glorfindel actually breaks the game - he definitely makes everyone look at other spirit heroes with a slight disdain. \n\nLets take a look at this hero: Threat 8: 2, 1, 2: 3 - fairly standard for a cheap hero. The ability is a bit lacking but I think it could be made to work.\n\nFor instance, you know that she's going to die to maximize her use you can use her to soak 2 wounds early, then use her ability.  Currently the allies we can get are also a bit limited (None of them particularly work with the Gondor trait). I think her best use might be to let you get back two escorts of Edoras, which would give you a lot of questing early in the game.  (It's +8 willpower). \n\nHer ability is slightly gimped by the fact she's been forced into the mono-sphere role (she'd be far better and more interesting if she could bring back 1 ally that matched the sphere of each other hero you had). It also wouldn't have seemed that broken if it brought back one ally for each hero you had (3 total).\n\nCurrently I'd probably have wanted her to get 1 or 2 less threat - I think if she'd been 2/1/1/3 for 6 threat with the same ability she'd have seen a lot more play, even 7 threat.\n\nOn the other hand, this ability is going to get better as the card pool expands and I happen to think it is very interesting. It lets you play a lot more recklessly with spirit allies, and it's easy to think of extra uses for it that might not be apparant without play.\n\nShe can defend, then sacrifice herself to give you two allies that are ready to also defend or attack for you (for example). \n\nI'm excited for her as a hero, even though currently we lack options in the spirit ally pool to really use her with.\n\nAs for the other cards; Most seem good; I'd like to comment on the three that seem worth talking about.\n\nPoision spikes; I like the trap theme, but this trap seems to be rubbish compared to the others. Forest Snare, pit trap and the best trap (-2 threat and no engagement checks) are all better. 2 damage a round is just so much worse when you can't aim it at the target you want either.\n\nA dwarf boosting card of any kind if unwelcome, a 0 cost discard two cards dwarf boosting card seems to be weak and unwelcome. It doesn't fit the dwarven theme or synergise well with dwarfs. They don't have deck manipulation to get the cards they want coming up next and they're mainly going to be full of allies rather than equipment. \n\nCombined with stargazer it would obviously be good if you set it up right, but they can't do it with just the dwarf trait. Even then, do we need to make dwarfs better in any way? (The answer is no: they're going to get some stuff from the sagas fairly soon automatically because of moria and gimli)\n\nThe spirit ally that you pay for with cards: This is amazing. Opening up a new mechanic for paying for cards with card discard instead of resources is a very welcome thing for the game. \n\nShe's somewhat ruined by two negative features: being Gondor (the trait most associated with resource wealth) and being heavily tied into the mono-deck theme (you would never use her outside of a mono-deck theme because discarding 3 cards to discard a card from your hand is so awful you'd never risk it.\n\nThis is a potentially very interesting line of new spirit cards though (cards paid for by discarding). and I think in a mono-spirit deck she would often see play (with stargazer especially). Also you can discard the cards to play her outside the planning phase (in response to a bad encounter deck draw for instance) which is very valuable imo. \n\nEdited August 15, 2013 by Rapier"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88541-spoiler-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=840975","commentId":840975,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1376591327,"content":">  \n> \n> > indeed- perhaps you are correct grandspleen...i mean take for example if ffg hadnt spoiled light of valinor the same time as glorfindel..he would seem a bit rubbish. perhaps we just need to wait :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n> \n>  \n> \n> You know better than this Rich.\n> \n> \n> \n>  \n\nyou are of course correct- i did have a mouthful of dinner whilst writing that and my mind cannot function whilst thinking of food ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nwhat i meant to point out was that glorfindel is so much better with a key card that just 'happened' to be spoilt at the same time. so perhaps it will work better by the end of the cycle...it will have to be quick though\n\nEdited August 15, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88541-spoiler-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=840989","commentId":840989,"userName":"Morithain","timestamp":1376591767,"content":"Yea.  You could play Caldera, Spirit Glorfindel and Eleanor.  Starting threat:  20 and great artwork.  Seems like that would be a pretty good combination with secrecy if you had some threat mitigation with it.  Light of valinor, fortune or fate, asfaloth, and you could make a decent deck, or so it would seem at first glance.  I'd give it a shot.\n\nEdited August 15, 2013 by Morithain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88541-spoiler-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=841035","commentId":841035,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1376593565,"content":"> Yea.  You could play Caldera, Spirit Glorfindel and Eleanor.  Starting threat:  20 and great artwork.  Seems like that would be a pretty good combination with secrecy if you had some threat mitigation with it.  Light of valinor, fortune or fate, asfaloth, and you could make a decent deck, or so it would seem at first glance.  I'd give it a shot.\n\n \n\nWorking her into a deck that you can get Resourceful out early would at least mitigate some of her downside (losing the resource she would generate each turn once she is dicarded).."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88541-spoiler-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=841147","commentId":841147,"userName":"leeroyer","timestamp":1376599883,"content":"Ok guys so is it just me or do you now also terribly want to build a multiplayer tactics Boromir deck with spoiled Hammer stroke? :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] I literally dream about wiping whole table of enemies with Boromir.. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] \nWhat do you think that such a deck would need? \nHere are my thoughts: \n-Shield of Gondor (obvious one)\n-Some attack increase (Still don't know which one... maybe just leadership marks)\n-Burning Brand would do its job (but Boromit would also need a song)\n-Some threat reduction will be definitivelly needed so I thought about lore Aragorn or some Spirit stuff (still don't know which would be better)\n\nAny other ideas? :-)\n\n\nAnd I am really looking forward to see more Rohan characters in deluxe expansions...

The only way I can personally see it working would be if one person was using an all spirit deck and the person playing caldera was using only her in the spirit sphere, or her and one other spirit character. There simply aren't enough spirit heroes for two players to be going monosphere spirit effectively. \n\n \n\nSo far I really love this hero. Just look at her ability as an advance of 4-8 resources at the cost of her actions during that time. If you finish the game within 4-8 turns (a good game) then you're looking at a good trade off.\n\n \n\nI've already made one deck and played with her... but she died in turn two thanks to a shadow effect that caused an attack to become undefended."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/88541-spoiler-blood-of-gondor-hero/?do=findComment&comment=848423","commentId":848423,"userName":"camacazio","timestamp":1377277421,"content":"Tolkien was writing at a time that gender roles were strictly defined. Women weren't fighting in WW2, certainly. Outside of Eowyn, which I am suspicious he felt super clever about killing the Witch King and gave her a fighting position for that reason alone, I don't think it crossed his mind at the time. I'm no expert, but I simply think that at the time of LOTR women didn't have place in Tolkien's war of the ring. This is archaic, and since I'm not a Tolkien expert I think I would've noticed if every hero outside of Eowyn was male a lot more than new female characters made by FFG."}]}
