Limit 1 per character.\n\nAttached character gets +2 hit points.\n\nResponse: When another character would be assigned any amount of damage, place 1 of that damage on attached character instead.\n\n\nDWARVEN SHIELD\n\nAttachment. Cost: 2.\n\nItem. Armor.\n\nAttach to a Dwarf hero. Restricted.\n\nAttached hero gets +1 DEF.\n\nResponse: After attached hero takes damage from an enemy attack, exhaust Dwarven Shield to add 1 resource to attached hero's pool.\n\nCan i use the response of the Dwarven Shield when getting 1 damage via Vigilant Guard by an enemy attack which damages another character?\nFor me the 1 damage via Vigilant Guard is caused by an enemy attack.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243605-vigilant-guard-dwarven-shield/?do=findComment&comment=2658841","commentId":2658841,"userName":"dr00","timestamp":1488198028,"content":"yes, it seems to work that way.\n\ndoesn't require that the hero is defending the attack, just that it comes from an attack.  Vigilant Guard isn't dealing damage, just moving where one of it is placed"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243605-vigilant-guard-dwarven-shield/?do=findComment&comment=2658846","commentId":2658846,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1488198725,"content":"Same as Song of Mocking btw ..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243605-vigilant-guard-dwarven-shield/?do=findComment&comment=2672850","commentId":2672850,"userName":"JanB","timestamp":1488983184,"content":"Nobody else .. :-("},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243605-vigilant-guard-dwarven-shield/?do=findComment&comment=2672863","commentId":2672863,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1488983516,"content":"So consensus is that Dwarven Shield can trigger off attack damage redirected by Vigilant Guard, Song of Mocking, or Sword-Thained Dori?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243605-vigilant-guard-dwarven-shield/?do=findComment&comment=2672907","commentId":2672907,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1488984897,"content":"Since the card moves rather than cancels and deals damage, that sounds reasonable. I have to say that the wording on the three cards seems to mean the same thing, but it is rather loose, especially on Song of Mocking. The meaning seems clear, but clearer wording across the three would make the intention clearer."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243605-vigilant-guard-dwarven-shield/?do=findComment&comment=2673165","commentId":2673165,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1488992371,"content":"I think it would work, but it's not 100% clear to me.  Might be worth checking with Caleb."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/243605-vigilant-guard-dwarven-shield/?do=findComment&comment=2674166","commentId":2674166,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1489024842,"content":"I think the key here is that Vigiiant guard is using a replacement effect \"instead\" to change where the damage goes, and not a response that prevents the original damage and creates a new point.\n\nI can't see it being worth bothering Caleb."}]}
