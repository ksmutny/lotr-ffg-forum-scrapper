Besides, we know it's not a printing defect since the previews and online images of the cards show this new coloring of the number also."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87245-hero-threat-printing/?do=findComment&comment=825376","commentId":825376,"userName":"JsBingley","timestamp":1375088308,"content":"too dark..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87245-hero-threat-printing/?do=findComment&comment=833211","commentId":833211,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1375864085,"content":"Way too dark.

Quite simple.\n\nCorrection. No colours are more expensive than others. It all comes down to how many colours you wanna use. 2 is the cheapest (black and white), then comes 4 colours (any of your choice) and then the whole pallet. In this case it won't effect the printing price since they already use the most \"expensive\" choice. My guess is that it's quiet possible a mistake. I say that based upon many years of experience working with layout, colours and printing. The mistake is quiet possible one of two.\n\n1. The color calibration could be slightly off and needs to be recalibrated. (Or it has been slightly off and finally been calibrated :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ) Also under this category is the possibility that someone have suddenly used another colour offset or template.\n\n2. It could be that by accident they have used a RGB colour code instead of CMYC. RGB is the colours you see on the monitor where as CMYC is the printing colours. So if I mess around in RGB and find a nice colour and then print it, it won't be exactly the same as I see it on screen. It will be a colour printed in CMYC.\n\nRegardless the reason for the mistake, the reason they have continued to use the colour is to maybe at least make on season match.\n\nOf cause there's a 3rd possibility that they just thought \"hey let try something new\".\n\nThe funny part is regardless if it's an error or deliberate it's interesting that no one has noticed or done anything about it in the test printing phase. Maybe they have had some students or substitutes that didn't notice ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\nOne of two things is definitely gonna happen. 1. Either they'll continue with this colour until they change their minds. Or 2. they will continue with this colour out the AtS cycle and then do something about it.\n\nWhat a rambling about something less important :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"}]}
