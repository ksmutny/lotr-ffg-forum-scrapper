Yes, strong enemies may not engage you, but they will stay in the staging area. And, is they stay in the staging area, you will quickly reach the point where you are unable to successfully quest, and start gaining up huge amounts of threat. To make matters worse, having a single hero makes combat almost impossible and slows down resource generation to a crawl, which means you want be able to clear baddies out from the staging area.\n\nThat being said, if you want a single hero, it would be hard to beat Aragorn, simply because he has the ability to unbow himself.\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43950-questions-questions-questions/?do=findComment&comment=440106","commentId":440106,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1300462991,"content":"If you want to play with a single hero use Aragorn and 3 copys of Gandalf.It will be wiser my friendgui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43950-questions-questions-questions/?do=findComment&comment=440113","commentId":440113,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1300463767,"content":"Unfortunately that means you'll have to wait 5 turns before you can play your first Gandalf by which point you're probably well on your way to losing. The only way I can see for a viable one-hero strategy is to have a deck full of 'generate extra resources' cards, and as yet not too many of those have been revealed.\n\nIn MECCG, playing with very few characters had advantages because it meant you would face less enemies, and a lot of hazard avoidance was dependent on small parties traveling through Middle Earth. In this game, the basic mechanic for drawing encounter cards is independent of the number of heroes so a big advantage of having small parties is taken away.  \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/43950-questions-questions-questions/?do=findComment&comment=440122","commentId":440122,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1300464832,"content":"ClydeCloggie said:\n\nUnfortunately that means you'll have to wait 5 turns before you can play your first Gandalf by which point you're probably well on your way to losing.
