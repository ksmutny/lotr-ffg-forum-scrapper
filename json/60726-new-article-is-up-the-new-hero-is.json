In this case I don't think they'll do that as all spheres are even again so that would put Leadership up two.\n\nMy guess is Elladan will either be a Leadership ally in this same Adventure pack or he'll be the Hero in the next one but will be a different sphere.\n\nIt might not make the most \"story sense\" but this is just a game so it doesn't really have to.

On the other hand, with Elladan in play, Elrohir is the only hero other than Bifur to have a threat value lower than the sum of his or her stats.

Elladan and Elrohir are Elves, they would not have aged significantly in the same period (not that they were depicted in the movies) and, as was already state, they were more bound together than Denethor's boys. In fact, there was probably justification for Faramir to not appear at all, or more of a \"Bilbo\" type card (support role)\n\nAs an aside, Faramir is hands down my favourite LOTR character and I want little more than a hero version of him- so much so I made one and posted it on the geek. That said, I think there is a lot more reason to have Faramir an ally with Boromir a hero than there is for one of Elrond's sons to be a hero and the other an ally (similarly, I would understand if they were both allies too...)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60726-new-article-is-up-the-new-hero-is/?do=findComment&comment=596775","commentId":596775,"userName":"starhawk77","timestamp":1329786821,"content":"aeazel said:\n\n \n\n Discussing this with a friend, it's likely because of the conditional +2.

We house rule him differently, his starting threat is 9 minus the number of players, seems to work well. Still has a place in 4 player games...\n\nOn a side note, Denethor is different since he has to exhaust for his ability to work.
