It is not only ill defined, but the wording is so loose that anyone can basically play around it.. This leads many people to ignore it completely and miss out on the true greatness of this game. This rule vastly improves this game.\n\nThe idea of this tweak is to bring the table talk rule back. Why is this good?\n\nWell Co-Op games suffer from a syndrome I call \"follow the leader\", this is when one player basically plays the entire game and directs other other players. This rule prevents this from happening. You can see this in action on most CoTR YouTube vids (though they are doing a video so they can be excused (almost) as they need a narator in a way. One player is playing and the other is basically a card drawing robot. Most co-op games have this problem where if you have a forceful personality at the table it can in a way become a solo game where other players all play as one. This is not co-op in my eyes. People working together is co-op... not one person commanding others.\n\nAlso it brings back into the game one of the greatest things about deck building games, the surprise and wow factor of seeing combos go off. Now you partner can swoop in and do power moves that impress and leave stories that you remember for years.\n\nIt also adds a trust element to the game.  You need to trust in your partner and they need to trust in you.. this fits the theme of this game perfectly. Relinquishing control is hard for people, anyone done that exercise were you fall backwards and are caught by your wife? Well, do it if you having and you will most likely feel a small rush.. as no matter how much you trust natural instinct to be on control kind of fights you... this feeling is now in the game. When things work it feels great.\n\nYou learn each others tactics. While the first few games might be a bit wonky, as time goes by you get a deeper understanding of how the other person plays. You become a true team where you can predict and anticipate your partner  and this leads to better decisions on the battle field. Our group can nearly work as one. This leads to becoming much better players.\n\nRules\n1) You may not talk about any card in your hand or deck, card counts in your deck, or deck abilities and combos.\n\n2) You may not discuss any card name, effect or use any trick to make it clear what card you are talking about.\n3) All visible cards can be discussed\n\nExamples of Legal Table Talk\n\"You take those two mobs, I'll optionally engage this one. Why don't you defend with that dude, and then I'll help attack back with my range guy here... \" etc etc\n\"Lets quest with these 3 here\"\n\"Why not tap your UC now\"\n\nExamples of Illegal Talk\nI think a wizard might turn up for a while and help us on this one.\nIf you defend with that guy you will not need to worry about the damage.\n\n \n\nWhen Revealed\n\nThe revision to the When Revealed rules was a huge mistake. This brings is back to how it was originally.\n\nWhen Revealed triggers as the card is moved to the staging area form any deck zone. Discard or Encounter deck. Drawing form encounter deck in ANY way, or form the discard pile in ANY way triggers when revealed, guarded, doomed and other keywords.\n\n \n\nCharacter Commit Timing\n\n \n\nAll characters of all players commit at the same instant in time at response speed. This allows forced and response effects to occur as normal but this slight tweak means all players commit at once.. meaning the commit step of the quest phase is a simultaneous phase for all players. After all players are commuted.. they leave as a group to quest.. at the one instant.\n\n \n\nAlso there is no action window at the end of the commit step. The commit itself is the last thing before the game over and is a game interrupt (like the quest cards). So nothing can ever be chosen to happen before it.\n\n \n\nWinning the Game\n\nYou can not win the game if there are still monsters in the staging area. You still play as normal but only ever add monsters equalling player count minus 1. Extra monsters drawn are discarded and not replaced. All other game rules continue. Once all monsters are dead the quest card can fully resolve.\n\n \n\nSo in a two player game you still reveal 2 cards a turn, but if you draw a monster and the 2nd is a monster it is discarded. Solo all mosters are discarded..\n\n \n\nIt always bugs us and leaves a feeling the quest is not done. Squeaking though a quest with a billion things ourt just feels wrong to us. This rule adds hardly any dificulty but gives the quests a feeling of reslution.\n\n \n\nDeck Building / Uniques\n\n \n\nMultiplayer hands are considered as a single deck, No hand may contain the same unique cards as the other hands. You can still have 3 of each in the hand.. but not the same named card among ALL the named hands.\n\n \n\nSo for example, in a 4 player game you can only have 3 gandalfs total among all 4 decks.\n\n \n\nOnce Per Game\n\n \n\nThis effect is limited to the deck.. (remeber multiplayer is considred a single deck). As well as limited to all copies of the card in the deck.\n\n \n\nYou can not move Agagorn around the table gaining threat reduction on each player, as the once per game effects that card for the entire game and all players. Landroval's effect can only be triggered once.\n\n \n\nCard Resolution\n\n * As much of a card must resolve as it can.\n * It always resolves in order\n * Failer of pats of the card do not effect the rest of the card unless the effects are linked in the sentence with a conjunction, and only then if the conjunction dose not refrence the start of the sentence.\n * All full stops denote a new reolution \"step\" in the card that is isolated form any failes of other parts of the card.\n * Non targeted effects can NEVER fail (all monsters gain +1 Will in staging area.. even if no monsters this still occours.. it just has no effect)\n\n \n\nBlah blah AND blah is a linking. So if either fails the other can still occour.\n\nBlah Blah THEN blah - If the 1st part fails THEN the 2nd part fails.. as in \"I dropped the plates then they broke\" If the plates are not dropped, they can not break.\n\nBlah blah THEN Blah. Blah-d-blah. If Blah Blah fails, THEN also fails, but Blah-d-blah resolves.\n\n \n\nNext, Last and First Player\n\n \n\nAll these terms apply to solo play. The solo player is simultaneously the 1st, last and next players anything that targets 1st, last or next targets the solo player at ALL times. \n\n \n\nAlso mechanically this means that \"behind the scenes\" the 1st player marker is considered to be transferring each round. \n\nEdited July 14, 2014 by booored"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105984-custom-rule-set-to-vastly-improve-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1080070","commentId":1080070,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1399757098,"content":"Good you have found a rule set that makes the game fun for you."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105984-custom-rule-set-to-vastly-improve-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1080103","commentId":1080103,"userName":"DurinIII","timestamp":1399760624,"content":"I like the examples of legal and illegal table talk!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105984-custom-rule-set-to-vastly-improve-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1080105","commentId":1080105,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1399760687,"content":"> Blah blah AND blah is a linking.

I regularly play 3-4-player games where we occasionally reveal we can summon a Gandalf next turn or play a particular event, and no one in our group has so far tried to direct the other players.\n\n \n\nThat said, the people I play with have been my best friends for almost 10 years, so we know each other pretty well - everyone listens to the others. Sometimes we suggest a course of action to try and make it through a combat phase with as few casualties as possible, but in the end it's up to the defending player. And the suggestions usually go like \"I can use my Sentinel if you like\" rather than \"Sacrifice your ally so your hero can attack\". I guess it really depends on what people you play with.\n\n \n\nNew thought: you've heard the phrase \"if you don't know anyone like that, it's probably you?\" I guess I could be more authoritative than the other players - it's usually I who reveal the encounter cards and calculate threat. I guess I see it as part of my \"job\", as I am also the main quester while the others prefer to handle heavy combat.\n\nEdited July 14, 2014 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/105984-custom-rule-set-to-vastly-improve-the-game/?do=findComment&comment=1154600","commentId":1154600,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1405328783,"content":"that is exactly the other method we use as well.

They make the game better.. mroe fun and exciting as well as giving all players a feeling of equal contributing at all time.

Unique cards have become so powerful and in circles with many dedicated players all with 3 cores having 12 Gandalf cards at the table is a real downer and as we play for points at the store we needed this restriction to stop some crazy shenanigans.\n\nWe are even considering a limit of 5 cards per deck of non-named for this same reason. Games suck when you have 12 tests of will and 12 shadow cancels etc etc. So 5 cards per deck regardless of how many hands that deck is.\n\n \n\n\n\n> The proposed, table talk rule and the proposed unique card rule are in conflict with each other. If you can't tell me that there are three Faramir's in your deck, how do I know if I can have a Faramir in my own?\n\nThey are not in conflict at all. There is nothing wrong with talking about decks and contents during the deck design before the game. In many cases one player has made all the hands. This information is sharable and is part of the general strategy that occurs before you start the game.\n\nThe thematic enhancement table talk rules are about restricting talk during the game, not during deck building or general strategic thinking like.. hand 2 can quest, and 3 has sentinels and can block for hand 1.. etc etc.\n\n \n\n\n\n> BTW, I also play a rule variant that no heroes can die and no players can be eliminated or the quest is failed. It's just generally more fun for us.\n\nI think while tossing a game and replaying if you choose to is a personal decision, there shouldn't be a rule about any death ending the game. I see nothing wrong with quitting and restarting if it falls apart to quickly, though when we play for points in contest at the store (we use these rules btw) we factor in retries as a penalty.. this stops restarts as a type of mulligan.\n\nI think deaths can be really fun, especially if you play campaigns that use the real death rules.\n\nEdited July 16, 2014 by booored"}]}
