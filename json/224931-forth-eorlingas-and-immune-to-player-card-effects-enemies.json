As the FAQ puts it for this situation (p. 13), \"...the chosen enemy's immunity does not factor.\" (Again, I consider this one of the most counterintuitive rulings in the game.)\n\n \n\nNow consider the wording of Haldir: \"Combat Action: If you have not engaged an enemy this round, exhaust Haldir of Lórien to declare him as an attacker (and resolve his attack) against an enemy not engaged with you.\" This is very, very similar to Quick Strike -- if you can come up with an argument that separates the two in this situation, I would love to hear it.\n\n \n\nOtherwise, let's take the FAQ again:\n\n \n\n\n\n> Q: What counts as a “ranged” attack?\n> \n> A: A ranged attack is an attack made by a character with the ranged keyword against an enemy engaged with another player.\n\n \n\nAnd elsewhere:\n\n \n\n\n\n> A card that is immune to player card effects can still be affected by normal framework effects such as placing progress from questing successfully, engaging an enemy during the encounter phase, or dealing damage through an attack made by a character.\n\nLet's throw in the Core's definition of ranged:\n\n\n\n> A character with the ranged keyword can be declared by its controller as an attacker against enemies that are engaged with other players.\n\nSo this is the putative reasoning:\n\n \n\n* Trigger Haldir's action, declaring him as an attacker against an Immune enemy engaged with someone else.\n\n* Per the above FAQ Q/A, this counts as a ranged attack.\n\n* (???) Per the Quick Strike stuff, it counts as a \"normal framework effect\" even though a player card Action is involved. To wit: look at Caleb's explanation in the OP of this thread: \"Basically, Quick Strike only works because it allows you to attack an enemy that you could typically attack. It just changes the time at which that attack takes place.\" Haldir's ability, when used against an engaged enemy, can be also be viewed as simply changing the time when a typical attack takes place.\n\n* Thus, per FAQ 1.47, the Immune enemy can still be damaged by it.\n\n \n\nThe question-marked step is the vulnerable point to me, but I do think it works.\n\n \n\n\n\n> So making a ranged attack against an immune enemy is legal? I think 'ranged' is only a word for an effect, which allows the character to target an enemy engaged with another player (same as Dunhere in the staging area) ... im confused?\n\nThis highlights the only other weakness in the above argument I can see: someone contending that Immune enemies are even immune to ranged attacks.

The reason that effects like Hands Upon the Bow and Forth Eorlingas! do not work against enemies that are immune to player card effects is because you can’t typically attack an enemy in the staging area.\n> > \n> >  \n> > \n> > You can't typically attack an enemy engaged with another player either.\n> \n> A character [affected by Forth Eorlingas!] with Ranged is typically able to attack an enemy [in the staging area] engaged with another player.  That other player does not need to initiate the attack.  It is still only 1 attack per enemy, but a player with ranged could initiate the attack on an enemy engaged with another player allowing their enemy to be killed before it would be their turn to initiate their attack against it.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nI'm not sure it is worthwhile to argue what a character can and cannot typically do.  That's a mess.  But I'm curious...\n\n \n\n1.  Would you say Eowyn could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player?\n\n2.  Would you say Eowyn with a Dunedain Cache could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player? \n\n3.  Would you say Eowyn with Forth Eorlingas! could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and is in the staging area?\n\n \n\nBonus (and I'll even answer this one for you :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]): Can one typically understand LOTR LCG rulings surrounding immunity to player card effects?  No!\n\n \n\nEdit: The truth is, we know how they are supposed to interact now, because we've asked, so that's good.  But it is seemingly contradictory based on the current rules we have.  They could easily come out and say why Ranged is different and why it is special, but it doesn't matter why in my opinion.  The why will most certainly be something arbitrary (like what you've stated regarding what a character can and cannot do \"typically\").  Arbitrary/one-off rulings are not helpful for players because they cannot be applied to future, similar situations.\n\nEdited October 31, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2482388","commentId":2482388,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1477936850,"content":"If we changed \"ordinarily attack\" to \"make an ordinary attack\", I think a clear distinction can be made between ranged and Forth Eorlingas!  A ranged character makes ordinary attacks against engaged enemies, they can combine with other players, there is no distinction made by kind and number.  With Forth Eorlingas! they are not ordinary attacks, they are attacks against enemies not engaged and they are restricted to Rohan Heroes only.\n\n \n\nHowever, Quick Strike is also enabling a non ordinary attack, since it's restricted to a single individual.  So it's not just a matter of being an \"ordinary attack\" which would exclude Haldir/Dunhere/Great Yew Bow.\n\n \n\nSo I think the invisible \"target\" is the most coherent explanation.  Engaged enemies can be attacked, immune or not, which means that anyone who can attack an enemy engaged with player A (which includes all ranged characters for B/C/D) can attack an immune enemy.  Enemies in the staging area (who aren't considered to be engaged) can't ordinarily be affected, so any cards that lets you attack them necessarily requires using a card effect to target that enemy -- and that's where the immune kicks in.\n\n \n\nI think it necessarily follows that if there is an immune enemy in the staging area *that is considered to be engaged* with the Dunhere player, that Dunhere can get his +1 attack if he attacks alone, since the bonus affects only Dunhere and is conditional solely on where the attacked enemy is.  Given the defense on such immune enemies, that's probably not very useful."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2482429","commentId":2482429,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1477938215,"content":"> I think it necessarily follows that if there is an immune enemy in the staging area *that is considered to be engaged* with the Dunhere player, that Dunhere can get his +1 attack if he attacks alone, since the bonus affects only Dunhere and is conditional solely on where the attacked enemy is.  Given the defense on such immune enemies, that's probably not very useful.\n\nWhile I essentially agree with cmabr002 that it is often fruitless to quibble about any effects surrounding Immune enemies, I still want to register disagreement on this point. Dúnhere is worded:\n\n\"Dúnhere can target enemies in the staging area when he attacks alone.

Therefore any player card ability that allows you to attack an enemy in the staging area, such as Haldir or Hands Upon the Bow, would not work on Host of Angmar because it would be immune to those effects.\n> \n> However, the ranged and sentinel keywords do not target the enemy, rather they affect the character they appear on and allow it to take advantage of framework actions that no enemy is immune to. So you can use sentinel to defend the Host of Angmar while it is engaged with another player, and you can use ranged to attack it.\n> \n> The Host can be tackled a couple of different ways: 1. You can dog-pile it with a lot of characters, including your friend’s ranged characters, combining their total attack. Cards like For Gondor! can help with this strategy by giving each attacking character +1 ATK. Or, 2. You can build up several super high attack strength heroes with lots of attachments that grant attack bonuses, such as Gondorian Fire and The Black Arrow. Since the Host’s engagement cost is 50, an event like Unseen Strike can help in a pinch.\n> \n> I would say that having several characters with the ranged keyword is very important in a multiplayer game so you can pile on the attack strength regardless of who the Host is engaged with.\n> \n> Cheers,\n> \n> Caleb"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2483735","commentId":2483735,"userName":"shosuko","timestamp":1478024502,"content":"Thanks JanB, and I think that enforces what I was saying.\n\n \n\ncmabr002 - It is not a grey area to talk about what a character can and cannot due.  While this game has a rocky rules element that often causes us to seek clarification, I think this one is pretty clear.  There is the game framework, and there are character abilities.  The game frame work allows a player to attack an enemy they are engaged with, or with ranged to attack an enemy engaged with another player.  Same with sentinel.  This is by the game framework, and is not a card ability.  Just as dealing damage is a game framework effect, so you can damage cards that are immune to player card effects, because the damage is not a card effect but a framework mechanic.\n\n \n\nQuick Strike has been ruled to allow a framework attack - meaning you could make an attack from a character you can make an attack with, against an enemy they could attack.  Forth Eorlingas, Hands Upon the Bow, ect all apply a player card effect which modifies the framework attack to extend it to the staging area.  I see a clear distinction between these two things now.  Ranged and Sentinel aren't card abilities, they are traits of a card which dictate their framework interaction, but Haldir's ability to shoot the staging area is a player card effect, because it is an ability on the card which adds an effect the basic rules of the game don't have.\n\n \n\nI'm as much for a comprehensive rules document, with as much errata as needed to give us a clearer, more consistent game experience, but I think in this situation it is pretty cut and dry.\n\n \n\nedit - \n\n \n\n1.  Would you say Eowyn could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player?\n\n- Eowyn cannot typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player because you can typically only attack an enemy engaged with you when you don't have the ranged trait.\n\n2.  Would you say Eowyn with a Dunedain Cache could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and engaged with another player? \n\n- As Dunedain Cache gives the ranged trait - and ranged character can typically attack an enemy that is engaged with another player - Eowyn with DC can attack an enemy engaged with another player that is immune to player card effects.  The card effect that gives her ranged effects her, the framework extends her ability to attack an enemy engaged with another player.\n\n3.  Would you say Eowyn with Forth Eorlingas! could typically attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects and is in the staging area?\n\n- Forth Eorlingas applies a player card effect to create the ability to make an attack into the staging area.  As this is a player card ability that does not follow the game framework rules for attacks, you cannot attack an enemy that is immune to player card effects.\n\n \n\nBonus - Tactics Eowyn is definitely one of the best cards in the game.  Which quest would you recommend to get the most use out of her +9 attack for 1 turn with say, Path of Need in play on the active location?\n\nEdited November 1, 2016 by shosuko"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/224931-forth-eorlingas-and-immune-to-player-card-effects-enemies/?do=findComment&comment=2487844","commentId":2487844,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1478250956,"content":"So the newly spoiled Oath of Eorl works against immune enemies as well?
