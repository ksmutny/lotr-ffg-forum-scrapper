Pretty much anyone who's played this game for a few years has noticed the fact that the game is supposed to be built horizontally rather than vertically. If you've played through Angmar Awakened and Dream-chaser you'll see how most cards are supposed to work in combination with others to great effect, but not so great on their own. The difference is that cards like, say, To the Sea! To the Sea! or Guardian of Arnor is that they're fantastic, while these are just boring. Now, ovbviously i haven't seen the rest of the cycle so I don't know if there's these amazing glue cards that will bring a Song or Pipe strategy to new heights, but I don't expect it to be so. If you look at these \"poweful capstone\" cards like Old Toby or Burst Into Song, they don't feel nearly as good as something like the ones I mentioned or stuff like Lords of the Eldar. Now, there's nothing really wrong with \"fun\" and \"quirky\" archetypes like Pipes or Songs, but you have to admit that even within this horizontal paradigm of combos and synergies, these cards feel very underpowered. Your comment strikes me as an apology for cards that direly need it because, you know, they're pretty bad. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2847230","commentId":2847230,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1498077033,"content":"I have to agree with Gizlivadi that this cycle of player cards has been quite disappointing.  I like that they are printing cards that only work in specific types of decks.  Unfotunately, the cards aren't even good enough to fit into the decks they were specifically designed for.  I have a pipe deck that I love, but I can't even justify slotting Old Toby into that because it is overcosted by at least 1.  Realistically, it is at best a \"Draw 2 cards (and maybe heal 2 damage) for 2 resources\".  I'd rather play Lorien's Wealth.  Fireside Song is another great example.  You have the huge restriction of needing both Songs and Hobbits, but most likely it will only be as good as a Celebrian's Stone.  If it cost 1 or did something else, that would be totally playable in the right deck, like it's supposed to be.\n\nThe dual-trait events are another problem.  Other than Unlikely Friendship, almost all of the dual-trait events feel like equal or worse versions of existing cards.  Those cards are more universally playable because it's not hard to get 2 traits, so it's more understandable.  But I wish they were just a little better."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2847256","commentId":2847256,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1498077726,"content":"If only Love of Tales hadn't received errata!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2847293","commentId":2847293,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1498078895,"content":"Here's the cards from the cycle I think are exceptional bargains:\n\nGreenwood Archer -- 2 attack for 2 resources in leadership, ranged and readying is just gravy.\n\nUnlikely Friendship (needs Elf/Dwarf) -- self-replacing free resource\n\nWait no Longer -- skipping the quest reveal in solo is amazing\n\nSteed of North -- ready on engage is dead useful\n\nDunedain Pathfinder -- like Dunedain Hunter, free allies for a one-time cost that the ally itself will help you pay.  Especially great with surging locations or locations with \"when revealed\" effect.\n\nSteward of Orthanc -- 2 wp for 3 neutral resources isn't bad, but optionally tacking a doom-1 card draw to any event is amazing for solo non-Lore decks.\n\nRed Arrow -- if you have a questing Gondorian, no reason to not have a copy of this in the deck.  +1 wp for 1 cost until you discard it for a free ally picked from your top five cards, at precisely the moment when a new ally would be most useful for combat.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2847294","commentId":2847294,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1498079004,"content":"> 25 minutes ago, Teamjimby said:\n> \n> I like that they are printing cards that only work in specific types of decks.  Unfotunately, the cards aren't even good enough to fit into the decks they were specifically designed for.\n\nThis pretty much summarizes it for me.

Not having allies was not a problem once Sam was questing for 6+; he finished one playthrough with 6 songs on him (I was proxying Song of Hope, and Sam had four resource icons from different songs; Resourceful meant he could pay for anything I drew). Permanent willpower boosts in a non-swarm deck (where Sword that was Broken and Faramir are less useful) are rare in the game: Celebrían's Stone is unique, Strider (which I was playing, not counting Frodo towards the 2 hero limit) has significant restrictions, and other options don't boost a character's willpower by more than 1.\n\nThere aren't many great songs that can attach to Hobbit heroes, but when the neutral song attachments provide +1 willpower on top of access to additional spheres and resource smoothing, they're quite good. With Mirror of Galadriel and Silver Harp to tutor, I included two copies of Song of Battle to provide access to a useful card like Dagger of Westernesse (my only Tactics card, with 2 copies). I certainly don't think Fireside Song is overpowered, but it is the key card that provided enough willpower to recreate Frodo and Sam's tiny fellowship and still beat a challenging quest (Sting and Phial of Galdriel also helped). I haven't tested it fully, but it should also help for beating Shadow of the Past without killing any Nazgûl (using Frodo/Sam/Spirit Pippin, with Out of Sight and Hobbit Sense)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2847994","commentId":2847994,"userName":"Edheliad","timestamp":1498119983,"content":"I did have Greenwood Archer appear during a combat phase A Very Good Tale-ing last night, which was a very nice way to add 5 attack to my Silvan deck's field when the Ringwraiths were starting to mount up. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/252479-raid-the-caravan/?do=findComment&comment=2850890","commentId":2850890,"userName":"donkler","timestamp":1498247753,"content":"If we are talking about powerful cards from the cycle, how has no one mentioned Hunting Party yet?

It's only meaningless to the subset of players that only play solo and choose to never employ any errata. That's a much weaker statement.\n\nAnd I'd suggest to anyone in that camp to take a look at the errata anyway.

I'll own my mistake there.\n\nAncillary to my overall point - which was meant to be (I may have gotten sidetracked) that I don't have a problem with the errata of MoL. Doesn't even mean that I couldn't think of ways they could have done it better - just that I don't have an issue with it as it currently stands.
