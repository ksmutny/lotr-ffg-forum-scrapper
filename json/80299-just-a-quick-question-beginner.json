It's just a way to prevent you from using that card effect more than once a round.\n\nOf course during the refresh phase your attachments will ready, just like all your other cards do."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80299-just-a-quick-question-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=770390","commentId":770390,"userName":"Ozil23","timestamp":1362508793,"content":"So if for example I'm using steward of gondor, I exhaust it, I gain 2 resources to that hero, and when the refresh phase begins I ready steward to gain 2 more resources and so on?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80299-just-a-quick-question-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=770397","commentId":770397,"userName":"Colino","timestamp":1362509266,"content":"Ozil23 said:\n\nSo if for example I'm using steward of gondor, I exhaust it, I gain 2 resources to that hero, and when the refresh phase begins I ready steward to gain 2 more resources and so on?\n\n\n\nYes, once readied you can exhaust it again.\n\nJust to be precise you don't get another 2 when readied, just when you exhaust it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/80299-just-a-quick-question-beginner/?do=findComment&comment=770492","commentId":770492,"userName":"Ozil23","timestamp":1362523055,"content":"Wow, one of the best cards in the game, isn't it?
