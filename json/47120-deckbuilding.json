Of course sneaking Gandalf is even more powerful but Beorn is cool. And with Ever Vigilant he can defend against pretty much anything as well and then get his attack.\n\nThe second option how to get him in play is (as you guessed) through Stand and Fight. Aragorn is the first obvious choice for Protector of Lorien so this way you get cards into the discard pile. But of course I prefer Sneak Attack.\n\nI put Steward on Dunhere, yes, unless Aragorn does not own the Stone (or it is in my hand yet)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47120-deckbuilding/?do=findComment&comment=472253","commentId":472253,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1305974646,"content":"Doh.

I'll try to justify my choices.\n\nI like the Gondorian Spearman Swift Strike combo and have used it to pretty powerful effect - killing up to 3 hp enemies (which is most of them) with it. But I still think these may be some of the first cards to go when better cards arrive. I have played Veteran and never used it to any effect basically. But that is due to a different playstyle I guess. I like allies with special abilities.\n\nInteresting about Gandalf's Search. You are the first person (I know) to talk positive about it. I thought it is utter useless whilst Lorien's Wealth is considered one of the more poweful ones. Your logic of drawing 1 card for the cost of 1 kinda makes sense though. And yes, options are good.\n\nAnd you may be right about Preservation, Daughter probably is better. You may lose it more easilly than the attachment (I guess) but you can often wait with the healing till after the Combat phase.\n\nI have considered Gleowine but he simply looks awful to the extent that I could not have it in the deck (call me silly).\n\nCalling my deck 2 a mess is an insult. Hehe, kidding. I actually thought it is tighter than the deck 1. It certainly is good enough for all the current scenarios but there is always space for improvement - which I indeed am seeking. In the moment, out of the blue and purple, there is really only Will of the West that I could consider including, and yet I cannot find a card in there that seems less important."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47120-deckbuilding/?do=findComment&comment=472256","commentId":472256,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1305974846,"content":"Mestrahd said:\n\n \n\nDoh.

I have been thinking of the Nightmare as well (which I still do not fully understand). And then there is one card that I usually want to get again, only I can't, Sneak Attack. Cards like A Test of Will or Hasty Stroke (which are useful to have almost any time) I can bring back with Dwarven Tomb but not this Leadership jewel."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47120-deckbuilding/?do=findComment&comment=472285","commentId":472285,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1305980820,"content":"I have never seen a real use to Will of the West except for the nightmare scenario, in which it is a must.

Makes sense. Thought as much at first and thus never inserted it in my deck. And I won't now. I guess the game may evolve in such a direction that the card will be more useful even in a non-nightmare mode. Perhaps either by making my deck much quicker (even though we tend to draw quite a bit, we still almost never reach halfway through now) or the scenarios run lot longer.\n\nI really long for a card that could let me use Sneak Attack more often - I can't see any other than WotW right now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/47120-deckbuilding/?do=findComment&comment=472412","commentId":472412,"userName":"Vyron2","timestamp":1306005700,"content":" I once had a VERY long scenario 2 game with a pure spirit deck...

And if playing coop, the other player may use it once also and then you already get him out three times which should be a Valinor of a help.\n\nBut I see the Will can help in certain cases. Looking forward to other cards of the kind in the future. Really wish to retrieve the Sneak Attack (and Ever Vigilant) once I get and play it."}]}
