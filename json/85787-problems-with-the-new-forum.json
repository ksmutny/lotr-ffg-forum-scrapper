We will continue to address bugs and refine the forum behavior over the coming weeks. Ideally, forum feedback should be sent directly to migration.support@fantasyflightgames.com.\n\nRegardless, we greatly appreciate the time you've all taken to make us aware of your experiences, both positive and negative.\n\nOnly a small selection of Avatar images were uploaded (over 1,300 to be exact), and we will continue to add more after we address the more pressing issues at hand. We appreciate your patience and hope you can find an acceptable image in the meantime!\n\nBest,\n\nFFG Webmaster\n\nPS – Also, let the Liking of posts commence."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85787-problems-with-the-new-forum/?do=findComment&comment=808002","commentId":808002,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1372893250,"content":"thanks very much for the notifications.\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/85787-problems-with-the-new-forum/?do=findComment&comment=808003","commentId":808003,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1372893590,"content":"Thank you FFG Webmaster! The Like button is fully functional now. I might just go around and like everybody's posts just because I can! Haha   In regards to your problem DevastazioneH88, it did the same thing with me with the profile avatars.
