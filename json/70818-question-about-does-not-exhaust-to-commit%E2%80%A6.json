After exhausting in one round (for whatever reason) he does not refresh at the end of that round since he cannot pay the two resources for \"Caught in a web\". During the next round, will he be able to commit to a quest even though he is exhausted (provided \"Light of Valinor\" is still attached)?\n\nReply:\n\nThat's one of those questions that made me say \"hmm\" because I can follow your train of thought. However, the answer is no; a character cannot commit to a quest when exhausted.\nCheers,\nCaleb\n\n \n\n "}]}
