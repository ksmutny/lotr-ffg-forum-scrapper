So, here it is, with some additions: \n\nI will begin this rant saying I've recently picked up this game,though I knew of its existence as soon as it was announced. At the time, however, I was busy playing Decipher's Lotr, and before that I was playing ICE's Middle Earth CCG. So, as you can see, I've enjoyed and experienced all Lotr-themed CCG's made to date and I picked this one up mainly because of the solo play factor and because it just looked like a good game (and it is). However, as a devoted Tolkien fan, I keep seeing some flaws in this LCG. I don't mind the non-canon characters, in fact I enjoy seeing them (Meccg had lots), so that's not the problem I have with this game. The thing that bothers me is how they've made the culture/race/faction spread. I think it looks rather disorganized and it seems like cards are just disconected from each other. What I'm saying here is that, for example, all Rohan cards don't really look like they belong in a particular culture/faction; another example would be Gondor. All these groups of cards, since they're spread in all spheres of influence, have this lore/aesthetical feel of being kind of disconnected, and frankly, I think that the creators of the game don't put much thought when naming and creating the concept of certain cards, or at least when placing them in a particular sphere or set. If the game right now supposedly takes place in the 17-year period before Frodo leaves the Shire, what is a card named Gildor's Counsel, with that particular art and flavor text doing in a set called The Hills of Emyn Muil? What is Gildor even doing there? (Note that I think both these cards were well made, Gildor's card feels like him and the lore behind them was very well thought, it's the fact that they're so misplaced that bugs me.) I could list lots of other examples. Everything about the card's lore and concept feels just so scattered, so out of place. Why did they decide to put Boromir in the Dead Marshes set, and Imrahil in A Journey to Rhosgobel; and Dúnhere, a character we read so little of, in the Core Set? There just seems to be so little reasoning behind the placing of each culture's cards and it looks like they just choose a random character and toss him in a random set, if you understand what I'm saying. And the main problem I this brings in my opinion is a big unbalance between races/cultures. One can't build, say, a consistent, coherent Gondor-themed deck without including at least three spheres of influence, and sometimes only one card of a particular sphere. There are other minor bugs I have with the game, like the \"Istari\" and \"Dúnedain\" keywords, and anachronic references to the \"Necromancer\", that show that the developers didn't make further research on these matters, but again, those are minor details.\n\nI think that maybe this will all be fixed when we get more sets and get to the proper Lotr novels, but then I think another problem may arise. I really enjoyed Decipher's Lotr. The fact that the cards were in fact divided by culture (Elves, Dwarves, Hobbits, etc) made it just feel better organized and \"tribal\" without it being that it was \"necessarily tribal\", or that you couln't mix and splash cultures as you wished when building a deck, but it gave a better visual flavor than just the word \"Dwarf\" written above the ability. However, what I didn't like about that game (though I think it couln't be helped) was the dozens of versions each character had. Will we get this too in Lotr LCG? It seems likely, being that we already have two versions of a bunch of characters already. When we get to the Lotr novels, will we get another Bilbo, or yet another Aragorn, for example? Or maybe (and I hope this was the case) we won't and they decided to put Bilbo early in THFG to make it unnecessary to make another in future sets. I don't know. Also, the fact that characters are divided in heroes and allies also helps the possibility of many version of the same character. I honestly hope that we'll see at most two cards for each character. More, in my opinion, wouldn't be necessary and feels like it kills the character's \"uniqueness\".\n\nSo I believe most of you now think that I hate this game or something like that. I don't. I love it, I like the gameplay, the very concept of the quest card, the illustrations, the visual design, etc. Enough to keep me playing it. It's just some lore and design things that really bother (or maybe will bother) me, and I was wondering if anyone else has felt something similar about them.\n\nAlso, I make mistakes with my Enlgish. It's not my first language and sometimes I confuse things.\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68600-a-little-worried-about-the-game-and-how-it-may-evolve/?do=findComment&comment=668883","commentId":668883,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1344172470,"content":"i shall post my old reply here, then take another read, if theres anything extra ill edit the post or post another one if the edit time run out\n\nhi\n\nfirstly let me start by saying i am a huge tolkien fan, as people who have been around on this forum for a while will know. i play this game because its lotr, not because im a gamer. so this will probably influence my answer, but with that said here is my reply……….\n\n-i have to say i respectfully disagree with you. i have found the races and cultures very well thought out. the art is of course amazing, and i can tell the designers research at least a fair amount before creating a character.\n\n-i feel that the races and cultures being spread over spheres is a good thing, and stops this game from being stale- after all there is many different people in all cultures, but they specialise in different areas. this i think is well represented in the game. for instance i wouldnt particularly like it if dwarves, being excellent fighters and craftsmen, were put just into tactics. there are of course many other skills that can be utilised. similarly elves are wise in lore, but they also have powerful warriors and leaders.\n\n-remember as well that with the excpetion of dwarves and possibly noldor, no other races have really been expanded on yet\n\nEDIT - i do agree the character release is slightly wierd- i mean mirkwood had boromir and imrahil which was very random indeed, however i actually have grown to like it. it keeps you guessing who you will get in the next pack, and again it keeps us from getting ALL the characters from one race or area all at once, which i think would get very old\n\n-the game used to go on that 'set in the years between end hobbit and start fellowship' but i really dont think that applies anymore. afterall we are getting thorin in the hobbit pack….someone dead by our game timescale. no, i think it is more of a loose area where ffg are saying 'we're not following the hobbit, and we're not following the trilogy'\n\ndue to this the game timescale cant be after the trilogy as sauron had fallen, and the game timescale cant be before the hobbit as many of the character werent alive (thus breaking even more tolkien lore) so that leaves the brief time between the two books as a loose backing for a timescale.\n\nof course this may change- the hobbit was a surprise when it was announced, and even though they are saga packs, we still can use the cards in our decks.\n\n-as for the multiple versions im not sure how many we shall get….remember we only have 2 characters so far who have 2 copies, which i dont think is that bad. granted i would be annoyed if several more came out when there are so many good tolkien characters, but i was one of those people who actually wanted a new glorfindel as i disliked the old one. i agree to an extent when you say it kills the characters uniqueness, and i see what you mean here, but i think as long as both copies offer us both different things when building decks, i dont think its a major problem. the problem comes when say a new copy comes out completely killing the old one- that would be a fail in design of course.\n\n \n\nfinally i would say dont worry too much…..ive been where you are right now- i love this game, am obsessed with it, and i got really annoyed during the first two packs of dwarrowdelf when ffg gave us about half of the player cards that were useless for solo…..so i messaged them and they replied both 1 and 2 player would get equal amounts of design intention, and true to their word the last 3 packs have had some excellent cards that really helps out a solo player.\n\nhope that all points covered\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68600-a-little-worried-about-the-game-and-how-it-may-evolve/?do=findComment&comment=668894","commentId":668894,"userName":"Dain Ironfoot","timestamp":1344175086,"content":"well, i don't think FFG intends the cards that come in a adventure pack to \"go with\" that quest, per se. as has been discussed elsewhere, an entire cycle is developed at once and then the cards are split amongst the various adventure packs.\n\nadditionally, given the way they are making the cards, just who *would* go in the dead marshes?

In fact, I tried before to convince myself this was the best option; however, the problem I have with it is the relation it will have with future sets. For example, since we got Imrahil so early in the game already, when we get to the Return of the King period and we get, say, the \"Houses of Healing\" adventure pack (sounds cool, huh?) will they release another Imrahil? Will they release all the remaining \"Imrahil-related\" cards (another Athelas, or \"Blade of Dol Amroth\", for example)? If they do, and I hope they do, then they would feel very disconnected with the already released Imrahil in the Rhosgobel expansion. Unless, of course, they release another Imrahil in the \"Houses of Healing\" expansion, but then I wouldn't like more versions of already existing characters. If they do release another Frodo in the Lotr novels storyline, or another Imrahil, it would render the previous Frodo and Imrahil pointless lore-wise. (That wouldn't be the case if they make a Frodo for the Fotr storyline and another in the Rotk storyline, since the character has changed and he is relevant in both scenarios, but since Frodo has nothing to do with the Conflict at the Carrock, or Imrahil with Rhosgobel, it wouldn't had made sense to put him there). I know what I'm writing sounds maybe a bit confusing, but that's because of my difficulties with English, and I tend to repeat myself.\n\nSo yeah, while I think the character release is interesting, I think it presents problems in the long term. Again, I would not like if they made another Imrahil later in the game, but then, when the time comes that an Imrahil card would be very appropiate because of the setting, why did they have to release him as a hero so early?\n\nrichsabre said:\n\n i think it is more of a loose area where ffg are saying 'we're not following the hobbit, and we're not following the trilogy'\n\n\n\nAlso, I don't see why this is a good thing.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68600-a-little-worried-about-the-game-and-how-it-may-evolve/?do=findComment&comment=668905","commentId":668905,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1344177143,"content":"Dain Ironfoot said:\n\nwell, i don't think FFG intends the cards that come in a adventure pack to \"go with\" that quest, per se. as has been discussed elsewhere, an entire cycle is developed at once and then the cards are split amongst the various adventure packs.\n\nadditionally, given the way they are making the cards, just who *would* go in the dead marshes? i'm not certainly up on my lore like some folks but it seems that some heroes aren't really meant to go in any location we've visited so far.\n\neither way, i think it's sorta a false assumption to think that whatever cards go \"with\" an adventure pack are designed *only* for that pack -- they are not. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n\n\n \n\nYes, I do understand that player cards don't \"go\" with the quest and that they're not intended to necessarily be played with them.

I think this game has more potential than any other card game based on Tolkien, but right now it feels incomplete. VERY incomplete. However, I have to disagree on some things you wrote about the previous Lotr TCG. I don't think it's true when you say it was SOLELY based around races. In fact I liked that, while you could make decks around one race or theme, it was also very easy to make decks based on certain parts of the story (thus mixing races) and splash cultures in the same deck. This was especially true in the first sets, when there weren't many cards for each culture, you actually had to mix them. Don't know if you remember, or maybe you started later, but actually \"rainbow decks\" were in fact the first decks to appear in the game. The fact that the resource system was generic (i.e. the same for every card) also helped this. There were no colours or different types of resources, so adding random characters with generic abilities was fairly easy, and sometimes recommended.\n\nMECCG, for its part, was, let's say, crazy about lore. CRAZY. Sure, you could give The One Ring to Legolas (an extremely foolish move, as he would have gotten corrupted in a couple of turns) but you first would have to travel to a place where you can find a gold ring, you would have to take a \"sage\" character with you such as Elrond (which you could only play if your company was at the character's home site or at Rivendell), then \"test\" the ring to see what type of magic ring it was, and if it turned out to be in fact The One Ring, you would have to travel half Middle-Earth (using a MAP that is, no less) facing the threat of hundreds of hazards (more or less depending on the size of your fellowship) including corruption from inside the fellowship, orcs, trolls, nazgul, bad weather, rivers and whatnot, to reach Mount Doom and then finally destroy The One Ring. And this was just one of the many ways to win. (Others included finding treasure, mustering different factions and peoples of Middle-Earth for your cause, crowning and proclaiming Aragorn as king and restoring the White Tree, etc) So yeah, it relied heavily on flavor for its mechanics, and it was extremely complicated (one of the reasons it was more a lot less played and part of the reasons it died quickly) but it was pretty amazing. I think though, that this game has even more potential and that if done right, it can be better than any other Lotr card game released before it. That's why I want it to avoid unnecessary versions for each character, and have each theme, culture and race properly and extensively developed to make a \"world-scope\" game; don't really care if it's through the course of many little expansions, but I would hate it if they leave themes or cultures incomplete or ambiguous. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/68600-a-little-worried-about-the-game-and-how-it-may-evolve/?do=findComment&comment=669059","commentId":669059,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1344203040,"content":" Also, note that I don't want them to make hundreds of cards for Gondor, for example, but what they've made so far with the Dwarves is to me ideal, enough to consider a culture complete and balanced within itself.
