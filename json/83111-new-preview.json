Really hard think!. So after this go back to easy level no way! But we already discuss this case many times…..\n\nSomeone want more easy, someone more challenge. still we need system when every quest can be rank up by the players (like in video games). Then will be ok. And please new ones  dont try to say just revealed one more card (most of the time is brake a game and make it impossible).\n\nI think most interesting quests in new cycle is Osgiliath( this one sounds great and challenge) Morgul vale and Blood of Gondor. Others look less interesting… I hate a feeling when you buy new pack and win from the first attempt without any problems. What a point of interesting mechanic if there is no challenge? But still is the best cycle for now and at least 3 quests is challenge there  as i mention above!\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83111-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=790224","commentId":790224,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1367272006,"content":"pretty bummed that there was no hero preview…was reallllly looking forward to a reveal that would tide me over until the pack's release.  that being said, it looks like FFG has made a really cool and original quest despite it's pedestrian appearance.   cannnnnot wait.  the time between when it is avaliable and when it arrives via mail will be tortuous"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83111-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=790231","commentId":790231,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1367273758,"content":"richsabre said:\n\n \n\nwell i suppose he could easily have lore denethor's stats and the ability. i cant see him having much else, i mean he was no warrior when it came to the war of the ring, his willpower was debatable….so i guess his defense should be high (more from a bodyguard than anything else)….perhaps he gets a personal defense buff when at least 1 gondor character is in play?\n\n \n\n \n\nOh boy would I love to argue this.\n\nDenethor had great Will Power that none of Sauron's underlings (including Black Numenoreans and Nazguls) would've been able to influence Denethor through Palantir. In fact, even when Sauron himself tried to 'mind control' Denethor, he was unable to penetrate through Denethor's mental strength and most he could do was show vague illusions from time to time (which proved enough).\n\nDenethor wore ringmail under his shirt any given time so his body won't go out of shape, so it is not unreasonable to assume he was once a great captain of Gondorian army in his youth and still maintains some of that physical prowness.\n\nI mean, even his arch-enemy (or whom he regarded as his political arch-enemy) Gandalf admitted that somehow blood of Numenor ran true and strong in Denethor's veins, so Denethor couldn't have been cowering weakling sitting in chair all day eating tomatoes while his son leads suicide charge (a single line of cavalry against batallion of Orcs. Great tactics btw).\n\n \n\nHaving said that, I was hoping for Leadership Denethor with 1/1/3/3 stats to maintain starting threat of 8 to counter rather costly starting threat of Boromir and Imrahil. And have something like 'response: When you raise your threat as result of card effect, spend 1 resource from Denethor to reduce your threat by 1' or 'response: When you raise your threat as result of card effect, place X damage tokens on Denethor to reduce your threat by X, X cannot be higher than threat you would have gained from the card effect'. That way Denethor can hold back the 'threat' of Mordor as long as he can by either using any means he have (resource) or sacrificing his mentality (damage tokens) and it would somewhat make sense to use the Palantir card along with him.\n\n \n\nEdit:\n@Glaurung\nI think you are correct to assume Steward's Fear won't be the 'challenging' scenario you are looking for.\nIt is the beginning of a Cycle and I expect somewhat similar difficulty to Hunt for Gollum or Redhorn Gate in respect to card pool we had when they were released (which wasn't mind-blowingly difficult).\nAs you suggested, the only way (or the only way I can see) FFG can satisfy both end of players (extremist such as yourself and casual players) is to make nightmare decks for each Cycle / Delux Expansions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83111-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=790239","commentId":790239,"userName":"hildargo","timestamp":1367275377,"content":"In regards to difficulty, the rulesheet rates it at a 5.

I actually do like the films very much, and I find some of the characters done just as well as they are in the books, or even better at times (Boromir, for instance). Whilst I am not very happy about Samwise, the one I think has been done awfully (and not because of the acting which is fine) is Denethor. There was nothing in the books suggesting Denethor just became mad and would everything to kill his son and let Minas Tirith destroyed. He was a great character.\n\nAs for the game, I think the stats remain the same. The only time the stats change between heroes is in case of Beorn, which is reasonable. Denethor shall keep his 1/1/3 + 3 and probably even the threat cost of 8. It will surprise me a bit if he is Leadership though, as we got Boromir last being Leadership too."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83111-new-preview/?do=findComment&comment=790343","commentId":790343,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1367308964,"content":"@khamul

while since i read the return)\n\nhowever….i was pointing out that he wasnt a warrior at the time of the war of the ring….by that i mean he wasnt like theoden for isntance, leading charges against the morder forces…he was more a tactician (though not tactics as in the sphere tactics)\n\n… and the willpower thing….again, i agree he withstood the palantir for a long time and i should have gave him credit for that in my post…he of course used it to his advantage, but you have to agree in the end the biased images sauron sent to him did drive him to his death.\n\nwhos to say that another in his place would have fared better in the long run? probably not, unless it was the likes of aragorn …i havnt read the return of the king as much as the fellowship, but i do remember the battle between aragorn and sauron through the palantir\n\nstill, i think that in the end, my main point resides on the fact that given the likes of frodo and aragorn have 2 willpower, and i personally see them far more powerful in will than denethor, that he should have 1 willpower
