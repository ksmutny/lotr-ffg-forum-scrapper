at what point in the game would you say 'no, do not buy these packs until you have these other ones'? .....can any game ever be both fully accessible whilst still posing a challenge for old gamers?\n\n \n\nmy personal thoughts on this are that no game can ever achieve this balance without resorting to some sort of logical chronological order- ie. black riders is harder than hiers of numenor which is harder than khazad dum.\n\n \n\nbecauase of the card pool's inevitable power increase over time the quests must therefore increase to pose any sort of challenge, however this in itself means that the game automatically loses some of its accessiblity - the higher you go the less able newcomers are to buy them without resorting to following the chronological line i spoke about before\n\n \n\nof course this means nothing if players are happy to buy quests they will find very difficult. however i think that the majority of the player base would agree that most new players will neither have the ability to win later quests with a core-set card pool, or want to keep losing until they have bought more packs- hence the advice i always give- go in order!\n\n \n\ni dont particularly see a problem with this. in my eyes this game should, in general, be played in order. in this i mean more 'cycle by cycle' rather than 'pack by pack'. the idea of increase in difficulty is only really visible as cycles increase, not individual packs.\n\n \n\nin addition to the above, i pose the question - what would you rather have?\n\n \n\n1. the game follow a chronological, steady difficulty increase as the cycles progress, with varying difficulty within each cycle, therefore new players usually need to buy older packs first\n\n2. the cycles vary in difficulty, allowing new players to skip much of the previous card pool and buy later cycles\n\n \n\ni see good and bad in each.\n\n \n\nthe first option allows a natural way to challenge current gamers, whilst new players naturally buy the packs mostly in order. ..however is this breaking the lcg format? which is a higher priority- attracting new gamers or keeping the ones you have?\n\n \n\nthe second option allows new players to access the game anywhere and ffg may end up attracting more new players. the older gamers may end up tiring of the easier cycles.\n\n \n\npersonally i would rather go for 1- the steady increase, but thats only becuase i have played from the release and have all the packs. then again, i also like easier quests i can take theme decks against, so option 2 has its attractions as well...is an inbetween possible :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]?\n\n \n\ni would be interested to hear new gamer's thoughts\n\n \n\nso, as at the start of the post, i think it comes to a balance between prioritising attracting new players, and keeping the current player base happy with new releases.\n\n \n\nthoughts?\n\nrich\n\nPS- completely forgot to say in the post that i actually think ffg are doing a great job of balancing the quest's difficulty increase with the card's power increase\n\nEdited October 20, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92383-what-do-you-think-of-the-games-accessibility/?do=findComment&comment=892862","commentId":892862,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1382303746,"content":"This is my first (and still, my only) card game, so I can't compare it to others.  But I'll say I'm happy with the way FFG seems to be considering new players as well as veterans like -- with just a Core, one could buy the Heirs of Numenor + Steward's Fear to make a very viable deck type (Outlands -- don't really need  Heirs, but can't play the SF quest without it).  Same goes for the Hobbit boxes and making a Dwarf deck, or the Black Riders and Hobbits.  Some of the quests are still going to be pretty hard with just the Core plus the pack you need to build a good deck, but doable.\n\n \n\nPersonally I like having the quests vary in difficulty from pack to pack rather than simply get harder all the time.  That would lead to insane power creep in terms of the player cards they would need to release.  I think they have done a good job thus far avoiding that trap-- Core and Mirkwood cards are still relevant, and even if some have become more or less obsolete, they still have a place in certain deck types (like Gleowine)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92383-what-do-you-think-of-the-games-accessibility/?do=findComment&comment=892872","commentId":892872,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1382304800,"content":"thanks for the thoughts grandspleen. i also think ffg have done an excellent job of the balance (forgot to say that in my initial post). i can still lose mirkwood quests. i think one of the most balanced quests that has kept its bite is journey down the anduin, ironically the 2nd of all quests.\n\n \n\nperhaps i am also underestimating the packs such as stewards fear, giving you an outlands deck right from the pack....these are a great way to help get the balance right (however personally i didnt like a pack centered on one faction...but more for personal reasons (i like my releases drawn out :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] ))\n\n \n\nrich\n\nEdited October 20, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92383-what-do-you-think-of-the-games-accessibility/?do=findComment&comment=892909","commentId":892909,"userName":"camacazio","timestamp":1382308333,"content":"I agree with grandspleen completely.

Cunir that is an excellent idea.....something for everyone in that idea. and i imagine it would only cost at most £10 more than a deluxe pack (which would be worth it)....of course the main problem is that a lot of older players would not be willing to spend more money (and on a pack they need in order to play the next cycle / collect all the packs) for a pack with core copies in / threat trackers....i especially see this being problematic for those who have already bought extra core sets.\n\n \n\ni have an extra core set and am pleased i bought it. however if the hypothetical 'new' core set had the cards we only got 1 copy of per core set i would buy it. i suppose i would buy it anyways for completion.\n\n \n\nagain, i see it as a balance even within that pack. when i first wrote the post last night i was thinking more #1, however looking at the difficulty of the current packs i am pretty satisfied, and at the moment i see ffg sort of doing a mixture of #1 and #2. there is an overall increase in the entire game order, however every cycle has consistent easier quests. i think if this is kept as it is, then this is the best balance\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92383-what-do-you-think-of-the-games-accessibility/?do=findComment&comment=893393","commentId":893393,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1382369258,"content":"HoN is much tougher than the previous packs - I'm pretty sure I couldn't have beaten it without cards from Shadows of Mirkwood and Dwarrowdelf.

Similarly I feel like HoN quests require someone to have Beregond, but lo; they give you everything you need to make him really effective and then more in the very first pack beyond it.

My rationale being that Dwarrowdelf quests are generally more difficult than Mirkwood ones, and Shadow ones have reverted to a more accessible level. I was going to say easy, but that would be perhaps clouding the issue.\n\nOf course, the relative ease of Mirkwood may be explained by the game's then-newness, with Dwarrowdelf having more to build on etc. FFG have said (somewhere) the Shadow quests are intended as a jumping-in point for new players, so perhaps this indicates that the Ringmaker quests will be correspondingly more difficult, as Dwarrowdelf is to Mirkwood. Time will tell on that, I suppose.\n\nI would like to see a more inclusive approach remain with future cycles, though. Rather than end up with cycle 7 being torture and playable exclusively by veterans who own everything including three core sets, I would like to see the six packs have a varying difficulty, with story/adventure quests taking equal place with the more beat-em-up quests we get. Keeping that sort of pace would be inclusive for new players, and if they can get nightmare mode out more regularly that would perhaps mitigate any glaurung-esque feelings (sorry, glaurung!)\n\nThat, though, might cause folks to feel a bit cheated by having to buy two products to play how they want. Hm. Well, how about instead they move to a distribution of the deluxe box having 2 quests but more player cards, then the packs having less player cards but more encounter cards to allow for their removal in easy mode...\n\nI'm just thinking aloud now, anyway..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92383-what-do-you-think-of-the-games-accessibility/?do=findComment&comment=897391","commentId":897391,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1382876561,"content":"thanks for the thoughts spalanzani. i agree on the point that using nightmare mode as a 'difficult' level in itself would feel like those who need a challenge need to buy them\n\n \n\ni think that a good idea is scaleable difficulty. i see many people saying assault on osgilliath is too easy, however i feel (and posted a thread about it) that this is a quest that has scaleable difficulty where you can pick you starting cards. want it easy go far the west gate (or is it east?) and the phalanx. want it hard....go for a immune location and the haradrim leader! :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92383-what-do-you-think-of-the-games-accessibility/?do=findComment&comment=897551","commentId":897551,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1382903840,"content":"i think for future cycles they might make them all reasonably hard, but also include \"easy mode\" instructions in the box so useless people (like me) can take cards out and make it a bit easier. that way they can try to please everyone at once."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92383-what-do-you-think-of-the-games-accessibility/?do=findComment&comment=897918","commentId":897918,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1382954905,"content":"Actually this is an interesting question...and hints imo at a dangerous weakness of FFGs effort to drive sales globally. What I am trying to say is that there should not even exist a thread like this. Instead it should be clear to every single player of this game how to proceed when faced with continued purchases of lotr lcg product.\n\n \n\nAlso for new players there should be an offical \"path\" made visible by ffg showing how to gradually imerse in this new gameplay experience. I am not sure if ffg even has a strategy when it comes to future development and new player acquisition, but I think introducing new features such as easy/nightmare mode and campaign mode are good examples.\n\n \n\nAlso there should be a small pamphlet introducing these features and the various ways on how to get the most \"bang for the buck\" when buying additional sets to the core set included in every core set. And it should be updated with every new print cycle. People don't buy when they're hesitating. Plus, the sales personal at the Game Stores should be informed as well and able to help. And know about exact dates for future releases so new players know what they can expect.\n\n \n\nThe sheer number of threads like \"Where to start\" / \"What to buy first\" shows that ffg can probably drive sales significantly by adressing these issues. Newsletters, official guides and such are not so expensive (i.e. don't take up that much work time) to produce and can make a huge difference. Also supply/stock is crucial. Around here it is impossible to get anything from the Mirkwood/Dwarrowdelf cycles...for close to a year now! Nowadays there are so many other games / dsitractions coming out constantly that people will quickly change to other things when they 1) don't know what to buy next or 2) cannot buy what they want next.\n\n \n\nAs is right now, the game becomes less accessible by the month for new players and a lot of acquisition potential is lost.
