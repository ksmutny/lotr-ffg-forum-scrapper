Only one copy of Desperate Alliance can be played by the group each phase.\n\n \n\n> Desperate Alliance\n> \n> Action: Choose a hero you control. Until the end of the phase, give control of that hero and all resources in that hero's resource pool to another player. (Limit 1 per phase.)\n\n \n\n> The “limit once per phase” on Desperate Alliance should be treated as “limit 1 Desperate Alliance per phase.” That limit is for all players so that only 1 copy of the event can be played by a player group in a phase.\n> \n> ...\n> \n> Caleb\n\n \n\nI think for the sake of consistency Desperate Alliance should be errata'd to use language similar to Tighten our Belts: \"Only once copy of X can be played by the players each Y\"."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/230371-limit-once-per-phase/?do=findComment&comment=2421131","commentId":2421131,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1474306216,"content":"Seastan...
