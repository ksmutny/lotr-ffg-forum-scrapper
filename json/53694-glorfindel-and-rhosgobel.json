Otherwise it works as normal I assume?\n\nQuest Stage 2 - using a card to heal Wilyador leads to that card being removed from the game. So I'm guessing you wouldn't want to use Glorfindel. However if you did - how would it work for scoring. Presumably 'removed from the game' stops Fortune or Fate, or any similar resurrection tools."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53694-glorfindel-and-rhosgobel/?do=findComment&comment=532906","commentId":532906,"userName":"Ohnomycocoa","timestamp":1316970898,"content":"1) Right - only restriction is you can't travel to Rhosgobel until stage 2 of the quest.\n\n2) Yes - Glorfindel would be removed from play if you use his ability. It would be a pretty desperate thing to do since it would only ever heal one damage from Wily. For scoring I would say he doesn't count as dead - thematically he has gone back to Radagast's hut to help heal the Eagle."}]}
