I think one cycle + 1 deluxe expansion makes it possible with only 1 core.   "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127304-just-one-core/?do=findComment&comment=1337967","commentId":1337967,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1416272906,"content":"Sleeves and proxies for the win."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127304-just-one-core/?do=findComment&comment=1338231","commentId":1338231,"userName":"chrsjxn","timestamp":1416288450,"content":"Yeah, if you're building out of just one core box, you'll want to stick to around 30 card decks, even if you're playing solo or with just one other person.

Scan away at those cards and use card sleeves to cover the dupes from the reals. I only support this if you already have purchased at least one copy of the card being duped.

(More than you would get if you only had 3 of each).\n\n \n\nI personally would have preferred two quests and more player cards in the core. Especially considering that Dol Guldor was a lottery to win anyway. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/127304-just-one-core/?do=findComment&comment=1339535","commentId":1339535,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1416381450,"content":"Yeah, while I have defeated Escape from Dol Guldur using Core set cards only (50-card decks, solo, 2-handed, and 2-player), I don't think that quest should have been included in the Core set. IMO, they probably should have put another level 4-6 difficulty quest in the Core set and released Escape from Dol Guldur as part of an adventure pack cycle.\n\n \n\nStill, while I have absolutely no regrets about my Core set purchase and have enjoyed the challenge and replay value of the harder quests contained therein, I have never played the game in anything other than solo or 2-player mode, so can't comment on how well three 30-card decks out of the Core set will perform against Journey Along the Anduin and Escape from Dol Guldur.\n\n \n\nGood luck, WillisRBC, welcome to the game… and maybe let us know how it goes?\n\n \n\nI hope you, your son, and fiancee enjoy it as much as many of us do!\n\nEdited November 19, 2014 by TwiceBornh"}]}
