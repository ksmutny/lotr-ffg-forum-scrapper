The encounter deck left 3 card 1 treachery and two Blocking Wargs.\n\nBlocking warg :Surge. When Revealed: Deal 1 damage to each character commited to the quest. (If the current quest has the battle or siege keyword, shuffle this card back into the encounter deck\n\n \n\nWew quest with only ally because we know that the blocking warg are there. The result is 0 treat in the stagging and all ally questing death. But his card shuffle back indefinitely.

The ability that shuffles blocking wargs back into the encounter deck is a \"when revealed\" effect and thus take place before the surge."}]}
