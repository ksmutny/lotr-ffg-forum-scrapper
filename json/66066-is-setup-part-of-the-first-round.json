The Set Up is like a mini round, and Round 1 starts after Set Up has all been applied.  You can use cards like 0 cost Events or Eleanor if appropriate, but Set Up is the only phase, so Eleanor wouldn't get Readied.  Cheers!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66066-is-setup-part-of-the-first-round/?do=findComment&comment=645543","commentId":645543,"userName":"bollywongaloid","timestamp":1339902093,"content":" I'm not so sure you can play cards in setup unless they are a response effect and cost 0. The rules are quite clear you can play responses (like Eleanor's effect) but cannot take actions during setup.\n\nFAQ 1.19\n\n\"When Revealed\" effects are resolved if the cards are revealed during setup. A player can trigger responses during setup, following the normal game rules.
