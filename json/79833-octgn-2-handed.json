The only thing I and think of is the port number. This usually defaults to 5000 but sometimes is 5001. Ensure the port number is the same for both games …..\n\nIf that still fails, you should be able to create a second OCTGN account and created a WAN game and join that using the normal match matchup."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79833-octgn-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=767467","commentId":767467,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1361886521,"content":"Both instances are using port 5000.\n\nDo you know if the error message (\"Could not connect: A connection attempt failed because…\") is logged somewhere?  If so, what file contains that complete error message?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79833-octgn-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=767475","commentId":767475,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1361887263,"content":"I commented out this line in my hosts file:\n\n::1 localhost\n\nOCTGN game me errors for a couple more attempts, but then started working.  I don't know if/why that fix did the trick.\n\nSo now I can play 2 instances locally, which is great news!\n\n \n\nI started a game, and noticed that when using 2 instances, when I use the Setup the Game option, the quest card is not automatically added to the quest area.  This isn't a big deal, but it does deviate from the single-instance behavior.\n\nWhat other differences are there between 1 and 2-handed OCTGN?\n\nAnd do you have any tips on how to make 2-handed OCTGN easier?\n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/79833-octgn-2-handed/?do=findComment&comment=799208","commentId":799208,"userName":"noctum_carpe","timestamp":1369574085,"content":"Hi im hijacking this thead, i have the same problem but cant solve it:( any new tips i cant connect either online or offline i have the same port and the ip adress as shown when i start a game but i get an error that i canot connect.\n\nI hope someone can help me!
