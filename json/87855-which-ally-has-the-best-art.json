ERK has a very dtailed look about it, while still retaining a very dwarven look and feel to me (stone arches, finely crafted clothes and articles).  But it was hard to choose him over Haldir.  Whereas Magali seems to paint the uber-lush portraits of characters with great detail in the faces and \"wind-swept\" hair a lot, I love that Haldir is heavily-cloaked and that his face is partially covered and obscured.  And instead of filling the card with vibrant colors, Magali limits it to a heavy use of orange and brown, and instead gets great contrast by using a beam of light breaking through the leaves.  This is probably one of my favorites by Magali.\n\n \n\nTactics are just the ugliest group of allies out there.  Period.  I do like the DoT becuase it's simple, and shows the overwhelming size of the Eagles 9in comparison to Gandalf standing next to him).  EoTMM is probably better artwork, but I like DoT just for how large it makes the eagles look (same with Vassal... ).\n\n \n\nSpirit seems to be the opposite for me... so many good-looking allies!!  Arwen, Elfhelm, Ethir Swordsman, stargazer, etc...  Putting aside how \"hot\" Arwen is, I really wanted to go with Elfhelm, for many of the same reasons I chose Haldir (muted colors, great use of light, etc), but in the end I had to stick with Damrod.  Odd, because he's definitely not as \"pretty\" as the rest of Magali's work, but there is still a great use of light and subdued colors.  I think I like it because the pic has more \"action\" than the other choices.  Magali is great at the \"epic pose\", characters standing there looking beautiful, gazing wisely off into the distance as if they are reading signs from the heavens... lol.  Damrod has a more brutish feel.  He is definitely not as pretty in the face as the others, and he's get his arms around an orc's head, and about to cut its throat with a blade.  Love the promise of violence that is about to happen!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87855-which-ally-has-the-best-art/?do=findComment&comment=832687","commentId":832687,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1375813593,"content":"I do believe the new \"Knight of Minas Tirith\" ally in the upcoming Assault on Osgiliath might be my favorite.\n\n \n\nI saw him spoiled in this article posted on another thread: http://deckbauer.telfador.net/cards.html&gameid=1&productid=95 [http://deckbauer.telfador.net/cards.html&gameid=1&productid=95]"}]}
