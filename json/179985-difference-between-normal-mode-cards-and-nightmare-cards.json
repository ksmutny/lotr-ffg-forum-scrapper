As some of you have pointed out, if your deck does not affect the top encounter card then there is no reason to study the top encounter card. Me and my brother only sleeve our player cards. It's considerably easier and cheaper to do. Plus the majority of the encounter cards won't be seeing much action as new stories come out. \n\n \n\nI have some print of demand cards for the game of thrones the board game. They have a considerable difference from the main game cards, but in board games FFG uses a different printing method for the cards that come with the box. They feel laminated whereas the normal lcg cards are more like the Magic cards. I don't believe that they are going to feel completely different. \n\n \n\n \n\n> As mentioned, sleeving them works good, but it sounds like you're like me and loathe to do that, so I tend to just deal from the bottom of the deck.

That gave me the idea to look for one of those card dealers they use for poker. Some of them conceal the top card but leave you with enough room to grab it. I do indeed hate sleeving cards... :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] The game already requires you to spend some time setting it up. Sleeving each different encounter deck would become too frustrating for my taste. And I would not even consider sleeving all of them as that would be too expensive to do... I prefer using that money for actual cards.. \n\nEdited June 12, 2015 by dimile"}]}
