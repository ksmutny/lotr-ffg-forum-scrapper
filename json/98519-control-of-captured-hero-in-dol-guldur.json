So rules lawyer says: Yes you still would count a 3rd spirit hero for Shipwright.\n\nYet you do turn the card upside down.. a state also not in the rules.. so we do not know.

With the Eagle of the Misty Mountains, the difference is that the face-down card is counted as an attachment, with no effect except to trigger the Eagle's effect - I assume the card loses all it's previous status and abilities, since this was clarified somewhere with regard to the Nameless things in Foundations of Stone. So for the Eagle the card remains in play, but changes what it counts as.\n\n \n\nThis makes the situation with the Hero in Escape from Dol Guldur a slightly different situation. Since cards can lose abilities etc. it doesn't really follow, to me, that it counts as out of play. The quest card makes no mention of losing control, or changing control, it just specifies:\n\n \n\n'Randomly select 1 hero card (among all the heroes controlled by the players) and turn it facedown. The hero is now considered a \"prisoner\", cannot be used, cannot be damaged, and does not collect resources, until it is \"rescued\" (as instructed by card effects) later in this quest.'\n\n \n\nSo technically this is still a controlled, but essentially unusable card, unless counting the hero towards the Pelargir Shipright is the equivalent of 'using' the hero. \n\n \n\nNot sure I really answered it, but it seems that the hero is not considered outside your control in game terms."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98519-control-of-captured-hero-in-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=974455","commentId":974455,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1391599839,"content":"Yeah, I tend to agree.

My captured hero in Dol Guldur is of lore sphere. Does he count as a hero under my control? Can i draw 1 card by him?\n\nA: I've gotten this question a few times. The \"prisoner\" hero is definitely still in play. That becomes more important in the nightmare mode. In normal play, the two most important things about \"the prisoner\" are: 1. that hero is turned facedown, and 2. that hero \"cannot be used.\" Together, this means the \"prisoner\" cannot contribute its card type, sphere, stats, traits, keywords, abilities, anything other than its uniqueness (i.e. I cannot play an ally version of the \"prisoner\" hero). So, no additional card draw for Mithrandir's Advice and does not count toward the number of Dwarf characters you control, etc. You could not attach anything to that hero either, because that would be using it's hero card type.\n\n \n\nhttp://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/97427-captured-hero-of-dol-guldur-in-your-control/#entry960757 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/index.php?/topic/97427-captured-hero-of-dol-guldur-in-your-control/#entry960757]\n\n \n\nIt's in page 2 now."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98519-control-of-captured-hero-in-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=974504","commentId":974504,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1391605851,"content":"What a crazy response..

In this game as it is co-op it is not that important but in card games in general you can not go to a comp and say \"blah blah in this thread posted this\" and expect a judge to accept that. If it aint written officially in the FAQ all we have is the card text and I think we all know what the literal interpretation is.. so it is up to you."}]}
