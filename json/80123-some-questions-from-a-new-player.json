Can you put progress tokens on a location while in the staging area or does it have to be traveled to first?\n\n2. Do you really have to exaust a character just to travel to a location and make it able to quest on or am i missing something? \n\n3. Can Snowbourn Scout place its 1 progress token on a (on its ablity) on a location in the staging area or does it have to be traveled to?\n\n4. I have Core set, KD and RTR.  What do you suggest i get next? The Mirkwood Cycle? The Dwarrowdelf or the Hobbit ones?
