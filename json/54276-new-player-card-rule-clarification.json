My question is about the \"Song\" cards. When the \"Song of Kings\" is attached to let's say Legolas, does that mean he gets both a Tactics Resource token AND a Leadership Resource token? Or does it mean Legolas' ONE resource token can be used to pay for both Tactics or Leadership sphere cards?\n\nThank you in advance for your replies!\n\nKevin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54276-new-player-card-rule-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=537686","commentId":537686,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1317854499,"content":" The second one.  This question has been asked several times on these forums."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/54276-new-player-card-rule-clarification/?do=findComment&comment=537690","commentId":537690,"userName":"kevmann","timestamp":1317855049,"content":"Thank you for the answer. I did a search for \"Song Cards\" and \"Song\" and \"Song of Kings\" and the only thing that came up were posts in the Star Wars LCG forums.
