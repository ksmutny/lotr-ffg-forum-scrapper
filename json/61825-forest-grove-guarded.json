However, should you also deal a guard when the objective is search for and directly added to the staging area via a card effect like Forest Grove? If yes, do you shuffle first then add the guard? Or just add whatever the next card was as the guard?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61825-forest-grove-guarded/?do=findComment&comment=605572","commentId":605572,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1331726020,"content":" The FAQ says that you resolve Guarded at any time the card enters play.  You'd need to shuffle the deck before drawing the guard, though, since otherwise you'd know what the guard card was going to be."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61825-forest-grove-guarded/?do=findComment&comment=605578","commentId":605578,"userName":"dcdennis","timestamp":1331727612,"content":" Technically the rules say anytime it enters play 'from the encounter deck'. given ffg's past rulings, i thought there might be a chance that this would skirt that verbiage.

We need a ruling from Nate to be certain but I am personally convinced the spirit of the rules is that if the card is placed in the staging area, you draw a new card to guard it regardless of were the objective card itself was drawn from.
