If you only have one ally in play and it is the one defending the attack that got dealt the shadow card, what happens? According to the wording of the card, it would be ok to move that ally back to your hand, assuming it is the only ally you control at the time. If that happens, what happens to the attack? Since the shadow effect occurs before the attack itself, does this effectively remove that ally from combat and potentially save it from the discard pile if it would have been killed? Thoughts?\n\n \n\nThanks!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59912-pursued-by-darkness-question/?do=findComment&comment=588586","commentId":588586,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1328133390,"content":" It does save the ally from being killed, but then makes the attack undefended."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59912-pursued-by-darkness-question/?do=findComment&comment=588626","commentId":588626,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1328143987,"content":"radiskull said:\n\n It does save the ally from being killed, but then makes the attack undefended.\n\n\n\ni have yet to see raidskull say anything  incorrect.... this is no exception."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59912-pursued-by-darkness-question/?do=findComment&comment=588635","commentId":588635,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1328145408,"content":"PbS as Shadow card for the Hill Troll when you're defending with your lone exhausted ally, Gandalf, is always \"fun\" demonio.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/demonio.gif] !
