The stats are similar, though more focused towards defense. The ability is arguably weaker (similar effect, no action advantage). Since uniques are usually stronger than non-uniques, this sounds perfectly in line in terms of power level. Ally-based defense tends not to be too popular, but this guy should be able to take at least two not too strong attacks. Overall, I'd say the power level is fine. The (probably intentional) lack of defensive allies in spirit makes this a fairly strong addition.\n\nOr to look at this from another perspective: At a cost of 2, this ally would be dramatically undercosted, at 4 it would not be played. 3 looks appropriate."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183163-is-3cost-2def-3health-spirit-ally-worth-it/?do=findComment&comment=1703151","commentId":1703151,"userName":"Edvando","timestamp":1437768233,"content":"I am the one that is saying that the \"cost of 3, 1 willpower, 1 attack, 2 defense and 3 health. It also has a response, that gets an engaged enemy -2 attack until the end of the round after the ally enters play.\" would have a hard time finding a spot in a deck unless you are desperate for a defender. He is called Town Watch.\n\n \n\nDwalin for 1 cost is good awesome. Having Sentinel helps him finding something to defend every turn. For 3, I never saw him played outside of Dwarf decks.\n\n \n\nHama is the best defender that spirit has. If I have the choice to put 3 Town Watch or 3 Hama, I would play 3 Hama. He can defend 2-3 strength attack and can sacrifice himself to the greater good to defend twice. Since he cost 3, your are probable playing him if you have 2-3 spirit heroes. Because of that, you deck probable is not combat focused to deal with lots of enemies, so being unique is not a big hindrace. If he dies, play the other one. If he doesnt, you dont need 2 hama on board.\n\n \n\nWarden of Helm's Deep can survive more attacks because he is 3 defense, instead of 2, has sentinel so can find more targets, is in a sphere more likely to be heavy combat every round and cost 3 in a sphere that has access to more resources. Also, can be easily played with Spirit Theoden.\n\n \n\nMy reasoning that his card deserve a little bit of buff is that if I plan to print a card at http://www.printerstudio.com/personalized/custom_playing_cards_blank_cards.html [http://www.printerstudio.com/personalized/custom_playing_cards_blank_cards.html], the card must carry his weight and find more reason to be included in my decks.\n\n \n\nAs printed, he would be hard to include. Not saying impossible, since even Taking Initiative can find a spot (Escape from Mount Gram). He can be used (in encounter quests with swarm mechanic with lots of 2-3 atk enemies), just not likely.\n\n \n\nEDIT: Link for the article https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1352629/octgn-expansion-dark-corners-middle-earth [https://boardgamegeek.com/article/19865549#19865549]\n\n \n\nEmery cost 0, can be played in any player control at action speed, so can appear at anytime, exactly when need. Outside pure spirit she doesn't find a spot.\n\nEdited July 24, 2015 by Edvando"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183163-is-3cost-2def-3health-spirit-ally-worth-it/?do=findComment&comment=1703171","commentId":1703171,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1437769269,"content":"So you agree that Hama is a good card and that this card is similar to Hama.  Decks with 2 spirit heroes can be good at combat, too.  Lately I've been running a deck with Glorfindel, Eowyn, and Beravor and I almost always have 6 attack power ready to swing.  I just need people to defend first. \n\n \n\nWhile you praise Hama's sacrifice ability, you completely ignore the custom card's enter play ability, not to mention the fact that Hama has 1 less hit point.  That 1 HP can make a big difference on quests that have a lot of treachery damage or archery. \n\n \n\nConsider a situation where you have a 4-5 attack enemy in the staging area that you need to defend.  Hama can use his ability to block it (and attack back for 2), but then he's gone.  This guy could survive that attack (possibly undamaged) and stick around for the future.\n\n \n\nYou also have to factor in the non-unique aspect.  3 copies of Hama means there's a good chance you have a dead card in your hand.  Not to mention that you can't use him if someone is using the Hama hero.\n\n \n\nSo is he better than Hama?  Maybe sometimes, but either way they are very close.  Does being slightly worse than Hama in a vacuum mean you'd never play him?  I hope not. \n\n \n\nIMO, if this guy were 2 cost I would include 3x copies in almost every spirit deck.  It would be like Defender of Rammas, but in the spirit sphere that sorely lacks defenders.  Cost of 3 makes him playable in certain decks, which is ultimately the goal of card design.  4 cost would be unplayable always."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/183163-is-3cost-2def-3health-spirit-ally-worth-it/?do=findComment&comment=1703207","commentId":1703207,"userName":"Edvando","timestamp":1437770970,"content":"> So you agree that Hama is a good card and that this card is similar to Hama.  Decks with 2 spirit heroes can be good at combat, too.  Lately I've been running a deck with Glorfindel, Eowyn, and Beravor and I almost always have 6 attack power ready to swing.  I just need people to defend first. \n> \n>  \n> \n> While you praise Hama's sacrifice ability, you completely ignore the custom card's enter play ability, not to mention the fact that Hama has 1 less hit point.  That 1 HP can make a big difference on quests that have a lot of treachery damage or archery. \n> \n>  \n> \n> Consider a situation where you have a 4-5 attack enemy in the staging area that you need to defend.  Hama can use his ability to block it (and attack back for 2), but then he's gone.  This guy could survive that attack (possibly undamaged) and stick around for the future.\n> \n>  \n> \n> You also have to factor in the non-unique aspect.  3 copies of Hama means there's a good chance you have a dead card in your hand.  Not to mention that you can't use him if someone is using the Hama hero.\n> \n>  \n> \n> So is he better than Hama?  Maybe sometimes, but either way they are very close.  Does being slightly worse than Hama in a vacuum mean you'd never play him?  I hope not. \n> \n>  \n> \n> IMO, if this guy were 2 cost I would include 3x copies in almost every spirit deck.  It would be like Defender of Rammas, but in the spirit sphere that sorely lacks defenders.  Cost of 3 makes him playable in certain decks, which is ultimately the goal of card design.  4 cost would be unplayable always.\n\n \n\n4 atk guy could kill Town Watch 40% of the time with a shadow card (percentage taken from nowhere), which you payed 3.

So to his ability to work in this situation, you will need to engage, survive one turn, then play Town Watch for -2 atk. This is one of the problems with his ability. Very situational and somewhat hard to use. A enemy must be engaged, the -2 atk need to make a difference (sometimes it doesn't against boss/huge enemies) and you must have 3 resources (which is easy in a 3 spirit heroes deck, but not as likely in a 2 spirit heroes deck).\n\n \n\nSo if you plan to use his ability, he is stuck in your hand.
