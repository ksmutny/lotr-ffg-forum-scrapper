For the first quest if you fail a hide test the nazgul engages you as per the quest card effect and attacks as per it's forced effect.\n\nA)does it get a shadow card for this?\n\nB) after the attack you don't count it's threat bc it's engaged with you and then you have to move into combat. Does it attack again? Does it get a shadow ?\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110869-black-riders-nazgul-help/?do=findComment&comment=1155506","commentId":1155506,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1405372723,"content":"A) yes, all additionnal attack receive a shadow card by default (that is discarded after the attack). This was added in last faq.\n\nB) yes, it is engaged, so not in the staging area anymore, and resolve the turn as normal.
