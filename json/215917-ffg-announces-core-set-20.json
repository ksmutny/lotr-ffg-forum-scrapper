Even though there are some mechanics/things in general I would like to see changed, I don't think it would be worth the work FFG would have to put in. Mainly this hits \"old\" Things and Cards, as the Designers really got better with time. Bilbo is a great example. Extremly over costed (threat wise). They are never gonna erata him, but in a reboot Things like this shouldn't happen, Designers should have noticed that his threat is to high for +1 Card. Or mechnics like secrecy, that never really came out great\n\n \n\nThe most interesting part surely would be what to do with the quests, as I think the way they work shouldn't be changed (AGoT didn't really Change mechanic mechanic wise, did it?) So they could Keep 1.0 Quests playable, what would be great for 1.0 Players, who at least could Keep the quests, even if they have to reboot their Player Cards.\n\n \n\nLast Point: The coreset should have better Card Distribution. AGoT 2.0 and Warhammer: Conquest had pretty good cores afaik and there weren't to many Things you couldn't use from 3 cores."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/215917-ffg-announces-core-set-20/?do=findComment&comment=2144736","commentId":2144736,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1459529409,"content":"I'd love to see them release an \"alternate core set\" to live alongside (and compliment) the existing core set.

It would include 3 new quests and could serve as an alternative starting point for new players (and probably a better starting point, honestly).\n\n \n\nBuying both cores would give you a sizeable (but basic) set of cards to start from, six quests, 3 copies of each card, and enough counters and tokens to play 4 player."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/215917-ffg-announces-core-set-20/?do=findComment&comment=2144779","commentId":2144779,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1459530667,"content":"I have been saying from the beginning that the reason Tactics gets shorted in built into the framework of the game:  You need to quest every turn, but you don't need to fight every turn.  Furthermore, the general threat rule of threat = WP + AT + DF + HP often means that tactics heroes get penalized for having good AT and DF, even though the can only use one per round (barring readying effects).\n\n \n\nI would like to see some sort of change to the framework of the game so that if you have an enemy engaged with you could arbitrarily make it a \"siege round\" or \"battle round\".
