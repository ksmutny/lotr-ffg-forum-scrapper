Play them for 1 and draw a new set of 6 cards with Galdor of the Haven's second ability.\n\n5 cost ally out (as well as To the Sea and something else 1 cost) first turn and a whole new set of cards (if you discarded cards like Elven Light, Glorfindel himself or Lords of the Eldar they are still usable from the discard pile as well).\n\nIf nobody mentioned it already Elrond with Vilya and Stargazer is an incredible combo.\n\nNot sure if it would be considered more to be a combo or just voltron-ing up a hero but I absolutely love decking out Elrohir with defensive attachments, sentinel and Steward of Gondor allowing him to defend the vast majority of enemy attacks across the board taking little to no damage in the process.\n\nAragorn + Roheryn + Anduril (Saga only) + one readying effect allows you to destroy an enemy after you optionally engage it with Roheryn (essentially providing a feint effect because it doesn't ever get to attack) and then you can defend against another enemy and then destroy it with Anduril's ability without an additional readying effect. So one attack (with a feint like effect), one defense and a second attack (three actions) for one readying effect. Pretty sweet deal. Requires a bit of setup but makes Aragorn a murder machine. Throw on Glamdring as well and you draw a card every time he kills an orc. Add more readying or get these cards set up on the new Fellowship Aragorn from The Flame of the West and he can quest (potentially with StwB and Banner of Elendil attached as well!) AND then perform these three actions as well.\n\nEdited August 14, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227586-what-are-good-combos/?do=findComment&comment=2364328","commentId":2364328,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1471152756,"content":"I'm just going to list good comboes that have not been mentioned regardless of card set.\n\nGandalf hero and pipe with Expert Treasure Hunter.

It's just that only today you could have stuff like Sword-thain + Wingfoot + Anborn. In short, what I'm trying to say is that the game has become increasingly and surprisingly janky in the recent years. Not particularly my cup of tea as I prefer straightforward ally mustering decks like Mono-Leadership Gondor or \"attachment mustering\" decks like Elladan and Elrohir, but to be fair I've come to appreciate stuff like Erestor and To the Sea! To the Sea! to drop some big ally first round or use Harvest and Steward first round. \n\nEdited August 15, 2016 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227586-what-are-good-combos/?do=findComment&comment=2365517","commentId":2365517,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1471231573,"content":"I feel like what they could have done with Gondorian Fire and Blood and Numenor is: \"Spend 1 resource from attached hero's resource pool to give attached hero +1 defense/+1 attack until the end of the phase.\".\n\nNo need to impose a limit.

And yet, Elrond Vilya and Seastan's Boromir are two of the most consistently powerful decks in the whole game. Why? Because the card draw effects in the game are ridiculously good, especially when you add Master of the Forge, Mirror of Galadriel and Heed the Dream into the mix, all cards that really enable combo-based strategies, to the point they're taking over the game IMO. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227586-what-are-good-combos/?do=findComment&comment=2366566","commentId":2366566,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1471284476,"content":"Heed the Dream (with the other lore cards) has made a new age in the whole lotr-game.

Of course you have both of them at any given time. I'mtalking about straightforward \"synergy\" army or attachment building decks (prime example, mono Leadership Gondor) vs janky combo-y decks like Anborn Sword-thain. Both of these types of decks has gotten more powerful recently (Rod of the Steward really helps Gondor or any army building deck with Leadership), BUT, my \"thesis\" if you will, is that on the designer end of things, they seems to be increasingly promoting a very janky, specific combo enviroment, at least way more than in the early cycles."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227586-what-are-good-combos/?do=findComment&comment=2368418","commentId":2368418,"userName":"13nrv","timestamp":1471363050,"content":"@Seastan\n\nYes :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\n \n\nI play 2-3 games per day !\n\n \n\nI will share it on ringsdb but later due to internet proxy at work which blocks.\n\nHeroes : Caldara/Arwen Undomiel/Galadriel.\n\n \n\nBut my previous version without Prince Imrahil Ally works very well on many NM.\n\nI have play it with mndela many times on NM and he can confirm.\n\nEdited August 16, 2016 by 13nrv"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/227586-what-are-good-combos/?do=findComment&comment=2368483","commentId":2368483,"userName":"13nrv","timestamp":1471364750,"content":"And i have used sometimes a good combo with my Caldara deck especially with very long scenario.\n\n \n\nFirst have an empty deck.\n\n1) Play a map of earnil on a dwarven tomb to retrieve a spirit card\n\n2) Dwarven tomb goes to the bottom of your empty deck\n\n3) Draw a card (Galadriel, Planning phase, Elven Light etc ...) which is Dwarven tomb\n\n4) Play Dwarven tomb on Map of Earnil\n\n5) Play Map of Earnil (For free when 4 heroes which is common in Caldara deck)\n\n6) Go back to one\n\n \n\nWhen your deck is empty you can each turn retrieve a spirit card in your discard pile, it allows to use ressources even if deck is empty.
