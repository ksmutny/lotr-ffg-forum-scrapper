I was extremely lucky with the Rangers of the North, of which I revealed 2 in the same turn, while the other went as a shadow card. The last two rounds were basically the following. Both The Shadow World and The Power fo Angmar are in play so Iarion is a 3/3/3, and I am engaged with Thaurdir, Cursed Dead, Dead Lord, and Thaurdir's Damned. I had a bunch of allies in play, including 2 Rangers of the North. I play Gandalf killing the Lord, quest for 7 with Sam and Halbarad (STWB), reveal some random location. Then Feint Thaurdir, successfully block the remaining 2 enemies and with all my might deal 5 damage to Thaurdir. Next turn I play another Gandalf, deal 4 damage to Thaurdir so he has no hitpoints left. Quest for like 22 and defeat the stage.\n\n \n\nMy conclusion of the deck is that it's basically a worse version of Elladan and Elrohir decks or Gondor decks that use Tactics Boromir + two Leadership heroes. Halbarad's ability is great for questing, and Aragorn's passive came in handy. But overall it really lacks action advantage in combat, since Heir of Mardil cannot go in any of these heroes. I hope we get some attachmet or something that readies Dúnedain, or get some Sneak Attack kinda effects. I have talked about Ranger of Cardolan before and I speculate that he's going to have some kind of Sneak Attack built in that you can use when you engage an enemy. That would be nice, but I don't think it would be enough. In any case, I am really curious about the new Dúnedain stuff we've been promised and hopefully it will make the Dúnedain archetype more versatile and just overall a bit more powerful. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180908-so-just-managed-to-beat-deadmens-dike-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1667618","commentId":1667618,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1434960717,"content":"I think I have just said that in another thread. So far, the Dúnedain decks are weak. I have a feeling they will become a bit like Gondor. Well, Gondor (pure theme I mean) decks are strong in the supporting role, not on their own. I am not sure how Dúnedain play as a support right now but on their own they are indeed quite weak. Of course, the more allies we get the better; but the expensive allies mean you would have to go for help in the likes of Horn or Steward of Gondor (the latter of which being the far safer bet here). I always feel like the factions with cheaper allies (hello Silvan, **** Outlands) tend to be more reliable and just overall more powerful.\n\nEdited June 22, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180908-so-just-managed-to-beat-deadmens-dike-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1667868","commentId":1667868,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1434983458,"content":"As a support, Dunedain can really rock in combat, and if you include Mablung (ok, not Dunedain...) they can even pump out resources to afford big expensive cards.

Which is a design crutch, and not a very subtle one. So if the Dunedain only work with a global boost, I'll be pretty bored. I'm a little tired of the final part of a trait being \"and everyone gets more stats\", rather than something, I dunno, cleverer (although, I should add, not being a designer, I don't know a) what this would be or b) if it would work, and I do appreciate the work they put in the vast majority of the time).\n\n \n\nI like the fact that right now, the Dunedain seem to work by reducing the enemies' stats, which is unusual, and something I think could be a better idea as a uniting theme. As it stands, every major trait deck works by boosting the meagre stats of the allies to epic levels, and to some extent just swarming the encounter deck. If the heroes could ready effectively, and be more about that than boosting the allies/heroes stats, I'd be more interested. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180908-so-just-managed-to-beat-deadmens-dike-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1668197","commentId":1668197,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1434996158,"content":"I'm all for a new unique mechanic that compensates for the Dúnedain's lack of global boosts. But since the trait seems to be specialized in leadership, the sphere of global boosts and ally mustering, I personally wouldn't mind seeing a global stat boost on the condition of having an engaged enemy, for example. It may be boring, but it's efficient.\n\n \n\nIn any case, I agree that what the deck really lacks is action advantage. Silvan elves have Galadriel's passive ability, mono leadership has Strength of Arms plus lots of allies, and tactics Boromir decks have, well, tactics Boromir. In-built Sneak Attack effects on allies would be nice, since it's essentially action advantage. I too would not like it if Dúnedain just swarmed the table with weenies, it would feel boring and too similar to Gondor. But if you can't have lots of allies, you have to compensate the lack of bodies with action advantage, be it with readying effects or temporal ally mustering."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180908-so-just-managed-to-beat-deadmens-dike-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1668950","commentId":1668950,"userName":"Fingolfin Fate","timestamp":1435034550,"content":"> Fingolfin Fate, solo Gondor right now is totally viable and pretty powerful, though of course it is weak against quests with lots of treacheries and ally hate.

I play it Boromir, Imrahil, Beregond, and whilst I really like the deck, it cannot compete against many quests most of the time. If you go mono-Leadership then it is no longer Gondor, well not Gondor I was talking about. Use Sam or Balin, or even Aragorn or Théodred and it gets better solo, yes, I have tried (the latter two especially) but it still doesn't compare to the real powerful decks: Rivendell, Lórien, etc.\n\nBut yes, Dúnedain need help but I am not expecting them to be viable power deck any time soon. (And I hope I am proven wrong).\n\n[edit] I have been using Veteran of Osgiliath since he had been first previewed. It is a very nice addition to the Gondor deck. I have also tried Doom Hangs Still. Without success whatsoever. But maybe it needs more games, and it most likely needs mono-Leadership.\n\nOn a side note, I do like the Leadership Boromir quite a bit. I wouldn't play a Gondor deck without him. The extra attack power is so helpful. The fact that the 0-attack allies like Errand-rider can make a difference, and Envoy of Pelargir hits for 2 for 1 resource, is quite invaluable in many situations, especially early game.\n\nEdited June 23, 2015 by Fingolfin Fate"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/180908-so-just-managed-to-beat-deadmens-dike-solo/?do=findComment&comment=1669446","commentId":1669446,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1435075762,"content":"I think that first you should try it with mono-leadership.

Readying effects are the most common and practical way to get action advantage (aside from chump blocking/weenies), although I agree, we could get some other form of action advantage, maybe like \"While condition X is met, your heroes or allies don't exhaust to do Y\". Call it readying or whatever, but it's essentially the same.
