Caleb's response...\n\n \n\nA side quest is only considered the “current quest” until the end of the phase, so the main quest would once again be considered the current quest as soon as the end of the phase triggers. Since the ability in question triggers “at the end of the quest phase” that means the main quest is the current quest for the purpose of resolving its effect. Therefore, you must place 1 progress on the main quest even if you placed progress on a side quest that round."}]}
