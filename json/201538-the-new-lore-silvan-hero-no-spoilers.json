We might get him but I’m just as inclined to think we’ll get another FFG hero or a minor character. I’ve been thinking for a while that the game would do a cycle revisiting Mirkwood and that would be a perfect time to get both Thranduil and a Lore Legolas.\n\n \n\nGuess we’ll just have to see--the way FFG spoils we really shouldn't have to wait too long. :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201538-the-new-lore-silvan-hero-no-spoilers/?do=findComment&comment=2036021","commentId":2036021,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1454718455,"content":"I played 2 Silvan decks 2-Handed, one with Legolas to get access to Tactics, and one with lower threat to make use of Haldir.
