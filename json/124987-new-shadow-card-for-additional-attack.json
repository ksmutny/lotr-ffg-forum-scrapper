If so he could attack as many as four or more times in a row... \n\n \n\nAlso in burgle attempts when you 'reveal the top card of the player deck\" does that get discarded or turned back down for drawing next turn? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124987-new-shadow-card-for-additional-attack/?do=findComment&comment=1301358","commentId":1301358,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1413426607,"content":"Yep unless stated otherwise you deal a shadow card for all attacks including \"additional\" ones.

Burning brand negates shadow effects which are different from the burgle effect. Your best hope is to use \"Dawn Take You All\" and remove the shadow card from play and bypass any chance of their being a burgle effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/124987-new-shadow-card-for-additional-attack/?do=findComment&comment=1332532","commentId":1332532,"userName":"TwiceBorn","timestamp":1415838886,"content":"Ouch… "}]}
