I'm 42 and live in the Tri-Cities, WA area (southeast WA state).\n\nLOTR has been an interesting experience in that I bought the base set and really liked it a lot, but after playing it a number of times I felt like I didn't really want to commit to the whole deal.  So I traded it off and kind of forgot about it for several months.  But then our family watched the LOTR trilogy together a few months ago and that got me back into the game again, and it coincided with the Khazad-dum announcements/release, which looked particularly appealing.  So it's a rare case where I bought a game, traded it away, then bought it again (and all of the APs), and like it even more now.  Another reason I had bailed is that while I really enjoyed playing the game, deck-building wasn't something I was that eager to get into, and I realized I'd have to do that in order to be successful with some quests.  Well, having found several sources online where people post custom decks made it easy to try out some different things.  So I've had a great time trying out some different deck ideas, and I've even surprised myself by doing a little dabbling of my own with deck-building.\n\nI made the Vassal module [http://www.vassalengine.org/mediawiki/images/9/91/LOTR_LCG_Vassal.vmod] that's been posted...  I travel a lot around the country, so with some games that I like to play solo, that's the best way to be able to play while on the road or waiting in airports and hotels and such.  I didn't intend to share it, assuming FFG wouldn't be okay with that, but since discovering the Lackey version I figured I should contact FFG about the Vassal module... They never responded, so I went ahead and shared the module with the same stipulation they requested for Lackey; that no cards will be included that haven't been released for 6 months.\n\nOne of my favorite things related to gaming is to create custom material for games I love.  I've created a lot of custom stuff for Arkham Horror in particular.  I really enjoyed making a Monty Python and the Holy Grail variant of Defenders of the Realm [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/652099/monty-python-and-the-defenders-of-the-realm], so I thought I might try the same kind of thing for LOTR:LCG.  It's kind of stalled as of late, with some other things pressing, but you can check out the progress at this link [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/749452/announcing-a-new-expansion-monty-python-and-the-ho].\n\nI'm a fan of the COTR podcast, and was a part-time contributor to the Dice Tower podcast for about a year."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60994-introduce-yourselvesi-dont-know-half-of-you-half-as-well-as-i-should-like-and-i-like-less-than-half-of-you-half-as-well-as-you-deserve-p/?do=findComment&comment=603302","commentId":603302,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1331139822,"content":"FallenTurtles said:\n\nI have seen The Host!

I really like the oddball humor that gets thrown in. And it's a little heartbreaking.  Outlander was pretty amazing. I felt like a kid again watching it.   I know this is another reading assignment with subtitles, but check out Trollhunter. It's a Norwegian creature comedy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60994-introduce-yourselvesi-dont-know-half-of-you-half-as-well-as-i-should-like-and-i-like-less-than-half-of-you-half-as-well-as-you-deserve-p/?do=findComment&comment=603425","commentId":603425,"userName":"The_Fallen_Arises","timestamp":1331163450,"content":" Hiya ! New here in the community, so I guess this is a nice way to begin my posting career ! :-)\n\n \n\nMy name's Etienne. I'm a French-Canadian living in Montreal. I'm 32 and I'm a History teacher in College (American history, ancient Greece and the first half of the 20th century are my main areas of expertise / interest).\n\nAlways been a geek, fan of tabletop gaming, board games and video games. I also thoroughly enjoy pop culture in general, mostly sci-fi, comics, fantasy and horror (mainly Star Wars....HUGE Star Wars fan).\n\nI read LOTR and The Hobbit when I was 13 after watching the Bakshi animated version. I was hooked right away. My favorite character is Boromir...redemption stories and last stands are things I'm drawn to.\n\nMy girlfriend bought me LOTR the card game last Xmas, and ever since that time I can't get enough. I'm not hat much into solo play, but I love me some 2-3 player coop ! My favorite sphere to play is Spirit and Lore, altough I started with Tactics. I must admit though, playing an Eagles deck is still a lot of fun :-)\n\n \n\nHope to contribute more to this community in the near future !\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60994-introduce-yourselvesi-dont-know-half-of-you-half-as-well-as-i-should-like-and-i-like-less-than-half-of-you-half-as-well-as-you-deserve-p/?do=findComment&comment=603475","commentId":603475,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1331172063,"content":"I love the idea of this Topic so i should to put my 2 cents here as well.\n\nIm 35 years old and i was born in Estonia.

Also i use to play a bit MECCG but those time (in 2000) the game was already dead so i concentrate on Decipher game. It was wonderful time. I was best player in My country and i use to play world Championship on 2001 or 2002. I didn remember now. In 2007 i quite cose i didn have enough time to play and forget about card games until just random i see some info about new Lotr card game from FFG just i week before game was release. Without any delay i order 2 core sets from E-Bay. I love Tolkien and miss 1more chance to travel to MIddle-Earth i cannot miss. Special i love play solo cose i dont have many players around me.

In the rare time I get when I'm not endlessly editing the cursed thing I board game and read books that are as far from Classics as I can get (so fantasy makes a delightful change). Have always loved the Tolkein universe, and so decided to dabble in this when it came out. I've now realised this is not a game that one dabbles in. Also, thanks to the gaming group I'm part of, I mostly play this solo. I'm a big fan of the euro style board games, as well as the BSG and GOT board games, and also play a little music.
