When i revealed encounter card it had a once revealed response that gave all exhausted cards 1 damage. Due the this i had to discard Faramir, does his ability still work?\n\nAlso, i reached last quest card of scenario 1 where it instructs you to put spider card into play and destroy the spawn to win. I had already eliminated this card in a previous round. Does this mean i automatically win or do i have to get this card back into staging area from discard pile to eliminate it again?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92015-timings/?do=findComment&comment=887960","commentId":887960,"userName":"Tracker1","timestamp":1381698648,"content":"Even though you lost Faramir you still get the +1 willpower to the characters. You could avoid that by waiting until all cards were revealed from the encounter deck and then use his ability before quest resolution.\n\nYou have to destroy the spawn again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92015-timings/?do=findComment&comment=887961","commentId":887961,"userName":"Olorin93","timestamp":1381698742,"content":"Welcome to the game!\n\n \n\n1) I think Faramir's ability works even if he himself is discarded midway through questing.\n\n \n\n2) You have to return Ungoliant's Spawn from the discard pile and defeat her again - sadly. Good luck!\n\nEdited October 13, 2013 by Olorin93"}]}
