Previously, Unexpected Courage might have seemed a waste for Glorfindel but Light of Valinor is a perfect fit. It works all the better with this version.\n\nI also agree with Boromir's comparison although he can still be jolly great and Gondor's synergies are all but coming pretty much.\n\nFinally, I do not think they gave up on 2 hero secrecy decks. From my experience the biggest drawback was not the money but the lack of actions early. Glorfindel with Light of Valinor fits either approach (2 or 3 hero deck). But I have a hunch some huge secrecy cards are still coming, especially the allies, there's only one so far and he's quite unimpressive. I'm expecting some cost 3 secrecy 2 allies."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65841-wonder-if-we-ever-see-a-hero-with-less-than-7-threat-who-combos-perfectly-with-elronds-council/?do=findComment&comment=643478","commentId":643478,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1339495601,"content":"Budgernaut said:\n\nGlaurung said:\n\n \n\nYou know when they start create more powerful players cards in second cycle i tell my self: Hey Glaurung now we have more powerful player cards is mean the quest will be more hard. \n\nBut with release RTR very easy one then WIW is also quite easy and TLD difficult 7 bit this quest maybe is more easy then previous ones i lose my hope.
