Then later in combat phase, I used a hero to deal another amount of damage to him (again brought down to one damage).  Both these events deal one damage to the Nazgûl but on separate occasions throughout one round.  \n\n \n\nIdeas or thoughts on this? \n\nEdited November 22, 2013 by Karlson"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93961-nazg%C3%BBl-of-minas-morgul/?do=findComment&comment=914799","commentId":914799,"userName":"Spurries","timestamp":1385154213,"content":"Since it doesn't say round, your thought was correct.  So you could do a Hail of stones, Gandalf, and then attack to get 3 on him in a round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93961-nazg%C3%BBl-of-minas-morgul/?do=findComment&comment=914802","commentId":914802,"userName":"ronaldo24","timestamp":1385154397,"content":"I would think you could attack him as many times and different ways as you want.  It's just 1 damage assigned, no matter what, when you do. \n\n \n\nRon\n\nyoushouldplaythis.com"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/93961-nazg%C3%BBl-of-minas-morgul/?do=findComment&comment=914803","commentId":914803,"userName":"Karlson","timestamp":1385154421,"content":"Oh, Hail of Stones...
