I wonder if this hints at future synergy among events which have matching traits with your heroes or heroes with special abilities (e.g. reduce the cost of event cards with the \"Gondor\" trait by 1)?\n\n \n\nI just thought it was really strange to see a race-specific trait on an event card since this has never been done before (unless I am mistaken).\n\n \n\nThoughts?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86008-gondorian-discipline-first-event-card-with-a-race-specific-trait/?do=findComment&comment=810146","commentId":810146,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1373307159,"content":"without going through all the cards i cannot think of any others. i hope new synergies come of it, things like gondorian discipline are really (obviously) meant for certain decks....such as a gondorian 'army' deck\n\n \n\nit would be nice to see these decks get the added help of the trait\n\nrich\n\nEdited July 8, 2013 by richsabre"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/86008-gondorian-discipline-first-event-card-with-a-race-specific-trait/?do=findComment&comment=810152","commentId":810152,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1373308193,"content":"Only relevent card I could think of is Eagles are Comming event card that came with Hunt for Gollum, which allowed us to search top 5 of player's deck for Eagle card and add to their hands.
