Do I need to draw this hidden card if I choose to do a side quest ?\n\nThanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280234-side-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3425783","commentId":3425783,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1533242377,"content":"Yes you have to.\n\nBut some effect that change the way you quest (battle, siege, defense) are only active when the selected quest is active.

Does the quest has both siege and battle (and you count the best between attack and defense for each character ?) or \"siege\"Â  replace \"battle\" while the location is active ?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280234-side-quests/?do=findComment&comment=3426670","commentId":3426670,"userName":"Onidsen","timestamp":1533287907,"content":"The location in question (The Crossroads) explicitly notes that the quest card gains Siege and loses Battle.
