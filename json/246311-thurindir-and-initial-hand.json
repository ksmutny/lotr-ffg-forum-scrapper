Does Thurindir's ability also happen after the mulligan has taken place?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246311-thurindir-and-initial-hand/?do=findComment&comment=2714550","commentId":2714550,"userName":"RichardPlunkett","timestamp":1491178023,"content":"My understanding is that you have choice on the order of Setup triggers, but that unless otherwise indicated that they all run after the standard setup actions.\n\nSo, you make the choice after initial draw and mulligan.\n\n \n\nEdited April 3, 2017 by RichardPlunkett"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/246311-thurindir-and-initial-hand/?do=findComment&comment=2714561","commentId":2714561,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1491178793,"content":"I asked once about this in relation to Ho!
