This is part of what the designer want in the \"immune\" package.\n\nThen again, what we know is that :\n\nyou can target his resources, you can target the damages he take, you can declare attack with quick strike against an immune enemy, location that are immune cannot receive token from northen tracker nor legolas.\n\nSo the \"immune\" package is quite different from other cards game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107755-protecting-beorn-from-taking-damage/?do=findComment&comment=1105792","commentId":1105792,"userName":"c08","timestamp":1401699842,"content":"Thanks"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/107755-protecting-beorn-from-taking-damage/?do=findComment&comment=1106384","commentId":1106384,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1401734814,"content":"> COMBO BREAKER!\n\nlove it when a plan comes together!"}]}
