I think that questions about gameplay need to be in the main forum that gets the most traffic. Otherwise, many people (especially new players with questions) will probably post them in the main forum, anyway.\n\n\n\nOne potential problem with not having a Rules and FAQ category of its own is that it becomes all the more difficult to find the information you are looking for.  For example, pumpkin started a fantastic thread way back when that has tons of great FAQ content. However, it continually falls off the first page and new players don't realize it's there and just start a new thread. Over time, multiple threads get started to ask and answer similar questions. If there is a sub-category just for Rules and FAQ's, I could see that happening a lot less. Also, searching for an answer that's already been posted would become easier.\n\nRight now, if you search for a key word (for example the name of a given card), the filter will pull up every post where that card name appears, no matter the subject. If you're searching for a Rules question about a certain card, searching in the Rules subcategory will help filter out anything that's not rules related."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60218-to-those-who-signed-petition-vote-for-your-catagory-choice-here/?do=findComment&comment=592145","commentId":592145,"userName":"muemakan","timestamp":1328792319,"content":" \n\n \n\n \n\n-General\n\n-Player created ( tournaments, decks,scenarios……)\n\n \n\n-Rules and FAQ\n\n\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60218-to-those-who-signed-petition-vote-for-your-catagory-choice-here/?do=findComment&comment=592159","commentId":592159,"userName":"Shiv@n","timestamp":1328793441,"content":"For me, at least \"news & previews\" and \"Rules & FAQ\" and whatever you want else !"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60218-to-those-who-signed-petition-vote-for-your-catagory-choice-here/?do=findComment&comment=592160","commentId":592160,"userName":"guest455987","timestamp":1328793508,"content":"muemakan said:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-General\n\n-Player created ( tournaments, decks,scenarios……)\n\n \n\n-Rules and FAQ\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nmuemakan said:\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n-General\n\n-Player created ( tournaments, decks,scenarios……)\n\n \n\n-Rules and FAQ\n\n\n\n \n\n \n\n\n\nThat right there would be ideal, I think.

Even if this feature was enabled for a window of time (like 1 week), those of us still active on the forums could switch the threads over to the new category that we care about the most.\n\nIf that second option can't happen, it would still be possible to create new posts in the new sub-forums with links to the \"old thread\" for those who wish to read the backstory. For example, with pumpkin's FAQ thread, pumpkin could cut and past all of the already compiled content in the first post of that original thread to a new post in the new Rules & FAQ category with a link at the bottom that takes readers back to the old thread for reference. I would do something similar for my key juicebox Tournament threads. Sure, it's not the most elegant solution, but there's no reason any threads should have to be lost."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/60218-to-those-who-signed-petition-vote-for-your-catagory-choice-here/?do=findComment&comment=592748","commentId":592748,"userName":"hendersondayton","timestamp":1328881227,"content":"I have been thru this several times in my own experience.
