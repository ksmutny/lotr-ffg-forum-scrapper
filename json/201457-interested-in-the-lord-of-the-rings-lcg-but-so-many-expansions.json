Furthermore, the small packs add new quests, heroes, allies, attachments, events and encounters to further customise the game. I suppose you need two core sets to be able to play it as a 4-player game.\n\n \n\nAre the cycles then the campaign, and are they listed in order on the FFG product page? What are deluxe expansions? Do they just add more cards on a larger scale than the smaller packs? I assume Saga expansions sort of converts the game into the Hobbit or other specific storylines based on the books.\n\n \n\nIs it mandatory to get all the smaller packs? And is there some kind of continuity list that tells the player what to play in order, in terms of the scenarios? What would you guys advise a new player to purchase? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201457-interested-in-the-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-but-so-many-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=2032930","commentId":2032930,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1454602332,"content":"1) Cycles are a set of thematically related adventures.\n\n2) Deluxe expansions, in addition to new player cards, introduce three scenarios and include encounter cards you'll need to play through it's associated cycle.\n\n3) Yes.\n\n4) Not at all.\n\n5) There's no enforced order in which to play through the scenarios, but a lot of people like to play through them in release order.\n\n6) https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/ [https://talesfromthecards.wordpress.com/2013/09/13/new-player-buying-guide/]is a fairly good purchasing guide for new players."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/201457-interested-in-the-lord-of-the-rings-lcg-but-so-many-expansions/?do=findComment&comment=2032940","commentId":2032940,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1454602464,"content":"Those quests are not customizable (at least not in the meaning I know).

Now that I think about it that is actually very similar to what I did. I put together the best deck I could from the core set, shadows of mirkwood packs and admittedly from a few other AP's as well (I bought a few AP's in the dwarrowdelf cycle as well as HoN just for some of the player cards :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png]) and then proceeded to play through the core and the shadows of mirkwood cycle start to finish making deck changes as I went along. It definitely teaches you how to play the game and tweak/create a deck for different quests. It also gives you a good idea of what you need to include in a deck built to take on any quest. Then you get to go back through the cycle with your end result and smash some face (or at least do a lot better)!\n\noh and welcome to the forums Grivenger, good luck with the core set!

If you prepare yourself for the difficulty of 2 of the core quests like Jon says, then you won't get disappointed.\n\nI worked through Mirkwood only adding to my card pool the cards from each pack individually. It meant I wasn't over faced with too many new cards and also, the cards with a pack often had some abilities designed to complement the adventure they came with. Worked great for me.\n\nAwesome game. Look forward to such different quests: escorting nobles through dangerous areas, hunting out secrets, healing giant eagles, city sieges, sea voyages, haunted castles, dungeons, epic monster battles, investigating spies,capturing enemies, forests, snow covered mountains, dragons, balrogs, murder mysteries and so much more, all somehow in a card game.

However, with LotR, that isn't necessary at all. Once you have the core set and learn how the game plays, then the more you move into the expansion content, the more quests you will have to play.

Don't let the availability drive your expectation to acquire a lot of the game content early on. Just know it's there as you need it.\n\nAs you do progress into the content of the game, you will realize that the game really comes alive in the deck building department. I will usually start a quest with a pretty generic deck, and then I typically end up losing the scenario. Then, I go back to my cards, and customize my Hero's and cards to best deal with the mechanics of the specific quest.
