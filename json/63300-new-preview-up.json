They can never get into your deck. So they just stay attached as you do the sort of \"nightmare\" mode of this campaign.\n\nThe thing I like about the news is that most of the player cards (all but five if I understand correctly) will be playable in all other quests as well. And that you shall be able to use all previous cards as well for the Hobbit (despite some strange thematic inconsistencies resulting from it - but they had been there before to some extent)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63300-new-preview-up/?do=findComment&comment=619416","commentId":619416,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1334773015,"content":"I don't see why you should not be allowed to use the new Bilbo, along with the Baggins sphere cards, in regular deckbuilding.

For one thing, the front of the treasure card looks more like a regular player card (just with the color theme of the Baggins sphere, and the \"sphere\" icon moved to the bottom of the card) than like an encounter card. In addition, the article states:\n\n... treasure cards gave us an answer; in order to include these powerful artifacts in their deck, players must first discover them in a specific scenario. ... These treasure cards ... have strong abilities in that make them well worth the effort to discover and play in later scenarios.\n\nAnyway, I'm eager to see the new saga expansion and find those treasures happy.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/happy.gif]\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63300-new-preview-up/?do=findComment&comment=619545","commentId":619545,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1334804262,"content":"Interesting point.

And then they can throw like three new Treasures in the next deluxe expansion, or even 1 in an Adventure pack from time to time, and the rules will already have been established.\n\nI definitely hope we see more of them if they are as cool as they seem."}]}
