If it were not the case, Silvan tracker would heal 1 damage on every silvan in play each turn regardless of their state.\n\n \n\n3) Flame of Anor is worded \"discard the top card of your deck to ready an Istari character\". The phrase after the \"to\" must be able to happen in order for you to pay the cost for it. If you allow Flame of Anor to work on ready Istari, you end up with other strange situations, where Boromir with Elf-friend pays 3 threat to ready himself (despite already being ready) in the refresh phase to fully heal himself with the help of Silvan tracker. Or you could have Treebeard ally who has stacked up a pile of resources paying to ready a Wellinghall Preserver 4 times in a row to completely heal himself. Or you could play Tale of Tinuviel despite not having any Dunedain characters, just in order to trigger Love of Tales. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1998756","commentId":1998756,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1453156230,"content":"I'm quite comfortable with \"ready a character\" being an effect that can target a ready character and do nothing.
