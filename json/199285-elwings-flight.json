If it were not the case, Silvan tracker would heal 1 damage on every silvan in play each turn regardless of their state.\n\n \n\n3) Flame of Anor is worded \"discard the top card of your deck to ready an Istari character\". The phrase after the \"to\" must be able to happen in order for you to pay the cost for it. If you allow Flame of Anor to work on ready Istari, you end up with other strange situations, where Boromir with Elf-friend pays 3 threat to ready himself (despite already being ready) in the refresh phase to fully heal himself with the help of Silvan tracker. Or you could have Treebeard ally who has stacked up a pile of resources paying to ready a Wellinghall Preserver 4 times in a row to completely heal himself. Or you could play Tale of Tinuviel despite not having any Dunedain characters, just in order to trigger Love of Tales. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=1998756","commentId":1998756,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1453156230,"content":"I'm quite comfortable with \"ready a character\" being an effect that can target a ready character and do nothing.

I'd assume Sneak Attack is done resolving and in the discard at that point.\n\n \n\nYes, Galadhrim Weaver is based on \"enters play\". \n\n \n\nI think so too, but if we accept that there is a limbo area, identifying when an event is considered to have \"its text effects are resolved\" is ambiguous.  It would be possible that Sneak Attack stays in limbo until the ally it sneak attacked is back in your hand.  I do not think that, even if there is a limbo area, it would stay in limbo that long, but I think it is certainly something that can be argued because the latter portion of its text effect could be viewed as \"not fully resolved\".\n\n \n\nI personally think that in this example Sneak Attack initiates a passive effect and it would already be in your discard pile when you are eligible to trigger the response on Galadhrim Weaver. \n\n \n\nMy main point, however, is that if we accept a limbo area, it could make other interactions more ambiguous.\n\nEdited January 19, 2016 by cmabr002"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199285-elwings-flight/?do=findComment&comment=2000530","commentId":2000530,"userName":"Seastan","timestamp":1453227076,"content":"No, I don't think that is the case.
