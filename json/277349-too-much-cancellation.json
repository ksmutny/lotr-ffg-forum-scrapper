May be you want to name another ally?\n\nSince I don't adapt my deck to scenario it will depend on deck. I always put 3 test of will in my non Erestor spirit decks. When coming to mono spirit I put some dwarven tombs but map of Earendil don't get played very much since Caladara errata.\n\nAnother interesting question is: how many test of will in multiplayer games? At 2 players 6 test of will are fine I found. At 3 players I vary between 8 and 9 test of will. I do sometime also play decks without spirit so it lower a lot my proportion of test of will ^^."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277349-too-much-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=3364024","commentId":3364024,"userName":"Devaresh","timestamp":1528330251,"content":"I actually rarely include Test of Will.

That deck I shared is the only one I have built to recur Test of Will so many times, so it is a bit of an odd one out for me. I sometimes use Eleanor or The Door is closed in multiplayer as well.\n\nFor multiplayer games, I prefer that one or more people bring treachery cancellation such as Test of Will, depending on the number of players. Treacheries can get very nasty in multiplayer where they can interact with more cards than they otherwise would in solo. That is why I sometimes play without treachery cancellation in solo, since you can get away with it in many scenarios.\n\nThough you don't always need cancellation in every situation, I would say too much is when you consistently have cancellation cards stagnating in your hand throughout the game, or you are so trigger happy to cancel treacheries that you even cancel those that wouldn't hurt you too badly. In that case, you should maybe play other cards that fill other needed functions."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277349-too-much-cancellation/?do=findComment&comment=3365020","commentId":3365020,"userName":"Devaresh","timestamp":1528390899,"content":"One of my next articles on playstyle for my blog is going to talk about variance and I’m actually going to be using the test of will versus taking treacheries to the face example.
