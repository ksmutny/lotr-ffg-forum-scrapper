Have they stated if these are/will be available separately. \n\nI  am not really interested in the bling, and I have no interest in how they did the digital version, I just want the card game content. I am hoping I can get it. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281715-limited-edition-starter-card-availability/?do=findComment&comment=3453750","commentId":3453750,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1535480923,"content":"They have not stated if they will be available separately; at the current time they are not."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281715-limited-edition-starter-card-availability/?do=findComment&comment=3453828","commentId":3453828,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1535486695,"content":"Luke Walasczek said in an interview with   Roll for Crit that they’re exclusive.

A) gives some exclusivity to those who went for the collectors edition and B) let's those of us who have it have them in the real layouts."}]}
