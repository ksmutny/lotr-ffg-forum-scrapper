That is, you might think that any action that involves picking up the top card of the encounter deck and turning it over and showing it to everyone is \"revealing\" it, because that's what the word means in ordinary usage. But for the purposes of the rules, this is not so (in game terms, the card has been \"looked at\" but not \"revealed\"), and so a card is only \"revealed\" if you're specifically told it has been. Discarding a card and looking at what's on it isn't \"revealing\" the card for the purposes of game rules."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300340-necklace-of-girion-treachery-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3791961","commentId":3791961,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1569275314,"content":"> 1 hour ago, caribecards said:\n> \n> I have another doubt, I would think that the cards are revealed before they are discarded, following this idea shouldn't the treachery cards be resolved before discarded?\n\nAs @Alonewolf87 [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/profile/329691-alonewolf87/] stated, they are not revealed.
