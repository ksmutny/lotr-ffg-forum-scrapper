Thematically I play that he cannot have more than 27 damage, since otherwise it's too easy to get him to get a guaranteed pass when you discard cards for the Dark Pik (just get him to 30+ damage)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/70405-doubts-about-phrasing-in-shadow-and-flame/?do=findComment&comment=689069","commentId":689069,"userName":"DevastazioneH88","timestamp":1346947355,"content":"I'd agree with you…but thematically you should not be allowed to put more progress tokens on a location the the printed number of progress tokens…and you cando that though…so I thought it was more or less the same thing…why would I be able to put 15 or 30 progress tokens on the first JATA questcard while the troll is in play if I cannot go anywhere ?

If I can place all the damage on 1 character, past there actual HP's,  then I wouldn't have to raise my threat (Hill Troll) or damage another character (Cave Troll). I realize you might only be talking about enemy cards but you also mentioned the Silverlode Archer taking 6 damage tokens."}]}
