Here is the link to the announcement:javascript:void(0);/*1352961754813*/ [http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/883993/a-special-announcement-from-feonix]\n\nI have not played any of the scenario created by Feonix but quick glance at The Culling at the Barrow-downs showed me that he has grate ideas (ex: objectives guarded by a specific enemy not random card, will power as defence against wight's attacking). In any case I am looking forward to the things he will bring to the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74325-new-lotrlcg-developer/?do=findComment&comment=723779","commentId":723779,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1352964812,"content":" Any chance of his custom scenarios getting a pod release now he's hired?

They just need to do the custom encounter cards and in the quest card make mention of the encounter sets needed to play the quest. \n\n \n\nIt is like a quest card from an Adventure Pack (it uses his own encounter deck and some of the expansion released before) Ex: The Hunt for Gollum AP quest uses:\n\nThe Hunt for Gollum encounter set (comes with the AP)\n\nJourney Down the Anduin encounter set (comes with Core)\n\nSauron's Reach encounter set (comes with Core)\n\n \n\nIt's just needed to say in the quest card an rules that may come with it that it uses some encounter set from Core, Khazad-dum, HoN, etc….\n\n \n\nI don't see why it cannot work in PoD format. \n\n \n\nMassing at Osgiliath and Battle of Lake Town don't use any but they could (especcially Battle of Lake Town if released after both the Hobbit saga)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74325-new-lotrlcg-developer/?do=findComment&comment=723840","commentId":723840,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1352973457,"content":" The issue is mixing POD cards in a deck with non-POD cards. \n\nThe cardstock is different enough for them to be readily distinguishable from each other (even if sleeved, I think)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74325-new-lotrlcg-developer/?do=findComment&comment=723846","commentId":723846,"userName":"CJMatos","timestamp":1352973796,"content":"jjeagle said:\n\n The issue is mixing POD cards in a deck with non-POD cards. \n\nThe cardstock is different enough for them to be readily distinguishable from each other (even if sleeved, I think).\n\n\n\n \n\nCardstock means the material use to build it?\n\n \n\nIf my assumption is correct, why is that relevant?

I.e. the design costs are most of the money that FFG has to put up. The main reason not to release them as POD is if FFG are planning to use the same concepts later on.\n\n \n\nThe barrow downs for insntance could make a deluxe expansion + cycle, using it on a POD might not be the best use of the location. However in that cycle, you might be able to get your quest worked in."}]}
