When a character leaves play, all tokens on that character are returned to the token bank and all attachments on that character are placed in the discard pile. Furthermore, the game text on dead heroes and allies in the discard pile is not active, so when you play Grave Cairn, the only attack value that you add is the target character’s printed attack strength.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/181216-grave-cairn-beorn/?do=findComment&comment=1672803","commentId":1672803,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1435326473,"content":"ok thanks <_< [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_dry.png]"}]}
