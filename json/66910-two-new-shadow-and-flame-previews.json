Now that I came back to Beravor, she seems by far the safest bet to draw them.\n\nShe actually suplanted Strider in the deck and as much as I like his ability and synergies, the deck works much better now because it can draw from the start. That is a huge difference compared even to the strongest drawing cards like Mathom.\n\nNow for the errata, Beravor is a strong hero in her stats, so I don't think she would go to waste if she could only draw once per round. With the Protector, she makes a great quester/blocker (more so with the Brand)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66910-two-new-shadow-and-flame-previews/?do=findComment&comment=653046","commentId":653046,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1341285513,"content":"…and as Rich mentioned, the art for the craftsman is just terrible.
