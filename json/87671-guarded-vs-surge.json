I drew a clue card. It's guarded so I reveal the next card to guard it. It is a doom and surge treachery and thus is discarded after resolved. Now, how was it with the surged card again. Is it:\n\nA. replacing the treachery card and guards the clue?\n\nB. just to be placed I'm the staging area?\n\nAlso, if you ever draw an enemy/location card with surge to guard an objective what happens to that second card I'm general? Can an objective be guarded by more than one card?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87671-guarded-vs-surge/?do=findComment&comment=829367","commentId":829367,"userName":"OnkelZorni","timestamp":1375439330,"content":"It's B, the first card drawn after the Objective card becomes the \"Guard\". Cards that were surged into do not interact with the objective card. So there will never be more than one card guarding an objectiv (under normal circumstances)\n\nÂ \n\nEdit: Missing word\n\nEdited August 2, 2013 by OnkelZorni"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/87671-guarded-vs-surge/?do=findComment&comment=829395","commentId":829395,"userName":"mr.thomasschmidt","timestamp":1375443021,"content":"Okay.
