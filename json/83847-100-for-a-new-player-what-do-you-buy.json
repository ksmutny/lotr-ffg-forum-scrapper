Or a little bit of both?  \n\n \n\nHope this helps,\n\nKhamul\n\n \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83847-100-for-a-new-player-what-do-you-buy/?do=findComment&comment=795354","commentId":795354,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1368524713,"content":"I'd definitely only say one core set. \n\nGet Mirkwood Cycle APs if you want to maximize the use of the encounter cards from Mirkwood.\n\n \n\nOtherwise, I'm really digging the stuff coming out now…\n\nSo I'd probably say 1 core set, Heirs of Numenor, Steward's Fear, and a couple APs from the Mirkwood cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83847-100-for-a-new-player-what-do-you-buy/?do=findComment&comment=795356","commentId":795356,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1368524793,"content":"gatharion said:\n\nI'd definitely only say one core set. \n\nGet Mirkwood Cycle APs if you want to maximize the use of the encounter cards from Mirkwood.\n\n\n\nEncounter cards from the core set, I meant to say"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83847-100-for-a-new-player-what-do-you-buy/?do=findComment&comment=795361","commentId":795361,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1368525131,"content":"Sorry gatharion, but I strongly disagree.  Almost every single place I see a review on Heirs of Numenor, they say DON\"T MAKE THIS ONE OF YOUR  FIRST PURCHESES AFTER THE CORE SET.   They tell you to buy quite a few expansions before you buy Heirs of Numenor due to its very hard difficulty.\n\nYeah i'd say its fine to buy one core set, but with two players, I would buy two.  I just think it wouldn't be a good idea to buy the Stewards Fear with little more than a core set, but I don't know much about the quest.  \n\n \n\nKhamul "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83847-100-for-a-new-player-what-do-you-buy/?do=findComment&comment=795377","commentId":795377,"userName":"Tyveil2","timestamp":1368528292,"content":"Since I'll be playing with my wife (and occasionally with more), I think we'll probably want 2 core sets.\n\nAlso we are pretty casual gamers to the high difficulty of the more recent packs may be a bit of a turn off.\n\nThanks for the info.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83847-100-for-a-new-player-what-do-you-buy/?do=findComment&comment=795385","commentId":795385,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1368529302,"content":"Sorry can you rephrase that second sentance again?  You are saying you are happy to play against a very hard expasnion or are you saying you dont want to?
