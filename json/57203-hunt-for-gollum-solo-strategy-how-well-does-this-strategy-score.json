So if you are building a deck just for HFG, and only for HFG you can only use cards from CORE+HFG.\n\nThe idea is that power creep in the card lists make the quest degrees easier each time you add new cards, so the \"restricted\" rule variant is pretty simple, you can only use cards that were in the card pool at the time of release of that AP. Also if you plan on playing Quest Chains (as in all of the mirkwood cycle) you can make your decks using all those cards and core, but not the coming packs.\n\nAnyway, this is how I play.. so I am not of much help.\n\nUsing Denathor to skry the encounter deck is very powerful, just make sure you do not scry to much. Remeber if you are sending the \"Hunters From Mordor\" to the bottom of the encounter deck each time (Denathor's ability dose NOT discard them) then when you get to the bottom of the deck, when you have all the clue tokens and stuff you will be drawing them one after the other. I played a game were I was kicking ass and forgot about that and suddenly I had 2 Hunters out both with 10 Threat/Attack. So it is a good idea to try and kill them mid game if you can.\n\nStill ur strat is sound if your not playing the restricted rules as map-maker would be illegal. Either way controlling your success tokens in 1b is a good idea either way, especially if you can control your threat.\n\nI do not normally bother recording my scores for solo play, but will do it (though I play restricted) I'll post in this thread when I am done.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57203-hunt-for-gollum-solo-strategy-how-well-does-this-strategy-score/?do=findComment&comment=564830","commentId":564830,"userName":"RGun","timestamp":1323211601,"content":"I like the \"restricted\" rule variant and I always use that approach to win a scenario the first time, but it's also fun to go back and see how much easier a scenario is with all of the new cards available to you.\n\nMap-maker isn't critical to this strategy, the key to winning HFG consistently as a solo player I think is to stack your deck with quest boosting attachments and allies and avoid completing the first phase until you have had time to play a strong set of allies and attachments because once you get into the second phase the extra encounter card that gets played at the beginning of each quest can quickly cause the staging area to fill up.  This extra encounter card is much more crippling playing solo because it effectively doubles the encounter cards added to the staging area each quest phase so you need to be able to finish the second phase quickly."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57203-hunt-for-gollum-solo-strategy-how-well-does-this-strategy-score/?do=findComment&comment=565055","commentId":565055,"userName":"TragicTheBlathering","timestamp":1323262739,"content":"I just played Lone Quest: HFG *RESTRICTED Solitaire with a score of 138.\n\nYou can find the Deck here\nhttp://tinyurl.com/7ujdtwe [http://tinyurl.com/7ujdtwe]\n\nAnd I in fact recorded the game itself if you wana see the deck in action.\n\n\n\n\n "}]}
