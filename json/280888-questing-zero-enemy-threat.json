I'm playing solo and have cleared the staging area at the end of a round. On the next round I commit characters to a quest and the encounter card I then reveal has no threat level (i.e. a treachery card). Does that phase become void or is the enemy threat then zero? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280888-questing-zero-enemy-threat/?do=findComment&comment=3439341","commentId":3439341,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1534168739,"content":"The threat in the staging area is 0, and you would resolve the quest phase normally, comparing that number to your committed willpower."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/280888-questing-zero-enemy-threat/?do=findComment&comment=3439565","commentId":3439565,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1534180025,"content":"Meaning you would make progress on the active location and quest equal to the amount of willpower you committed, since you revealed no threat to reduce it."}]}
