We Eagles would not fly so low nor so slow to be hit by the enemy that easily. I scoff my feathered wings at this video.\n\n \n\nThat being said...this is still very funny.\n\n \n\nBut the real reason we didn't fly Gandalf and company to Mt. Doom to destroy the Ring is because we were too busy playing our favorite card game at the time. I remember I had just finished the second stage of The Redhorn Gate when the Fellowship set out from Rivendell. By the time Frodo had reached Mt. Doom we finally were able to collect enough victory points to complete the quest (those locations kept being discarded as shadow cards!). We then flew to the Black Gate just in time to rescue our Heroes. To this day we haven't played that quest again..."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126746-hilarious-video-of-why-eagles-wouldnt-work/?do=findComment&comment=1329316","commentId":1329316,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1415642908,"content":"Here's better theory why they didn't fly with the eagles but not as entertaining http://www.tickld.com/x/this-guy-just-changed-the-way-we-see-lord-of-the-rings-mind-blown [http://www.tickld.com/x/this-guy-just-changed-the-way-we-see-lord-of-the-rings-mind-blown]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126746-hilarious-video-of-why-eagles-wouldnt-work/?do=findComment&comment=1329694","commentId":1329694,"userName":"Crabble","timestamp":1415657681,"content":"That explains it all!
