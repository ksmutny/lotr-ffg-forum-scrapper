(Sorry, Turin)  He's a character of great(inserted?) lineage(kinsman of Thingol), that doesn't really get fleshed out on the back end. Regardless, being the grandfather of the queen of Gondor and father-in-law to Elrond bears some weight. Heck, even the Gaffer is honored through his son.  It's through his martial leadership that Lorien is defended and Dol Guldur successfully assaulted for Galadriel to Nenya-nuke its core to bring healing to Mirkwood.   He's also the giver of gifts, right?  I highly doubt Galadriel is like a mom buying Celeborn stuff to give to his sister and dad for Christmas. I would say(off the top of my head) the one gift Galadriel presented independently from him was the blessing to Gimli. Even though we get very little information about him, we have to assume there's a reason he's a match for Galadriel.     I just finished rereading the appendices.  Celeborn is ridiculous in the movies.\n\n \n\n "}]}
