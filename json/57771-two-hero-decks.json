Supposedly it's possible, but the resource acquisition detriment seems impossible to deal with unless you're heavy in Leadership. Is it worth playing with?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57771-two-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=569032","commentId":569032,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1324231927,"content":"I have been thinking about this myself.The rules say you can use 3 at max, so in theory you can use 1 Hero. Still I can not really see any reason to do so. I think this rule is a allowance that they have put in the rules to give them the freedom to add other mechanics in future packs. Say they make a new keyword or a new something that suddenly makes you want to run less Heroes. Still for now I just can not see any reason to not run 3 heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57771-two-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=569090","commentId":569090,"userName":"CastorJo","timestamp":1324252599,"content":" One reason is to begin with a lower threat value. But I'm ok, it is often better to begin with 3 heroes."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/57771-two-hero-decks/?do=findComment&comment=569146","commentId":569146,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1324273930,"content":"That is what happens at the start of the Dol Guldur scenario, and we know it is practically impossible to win solo.
