So I revealed the next card and it was Old Wive's Tale.  Since it was part of the setup, do I get rid of my starting money? Or since they technically didn't have any because setup happens before the resource phase, do all my heroes exhaust? Or does nothing happen? Some clarification on this would be much appreciated."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71610-old-wives-tale-as-first-draw%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=699057","commentId":699057,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1348425685,"content":"as you wont have any resources all heros start the game exhausted\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71610-old-wives-tale-as-first-draw%E2%80%A6/?do=findComment&comment=699115","commentId":699115,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1348431519,"content":" Really?
