The captured hero is a non-entity until rescued, so you must proceed as though he/she isn't even there while in captivity.\n\nFor 3, yes, the threat will always count against you because threat level is determined in step 2 of the set up and quest cards are not flipped over (which is when the prisoner is determined) until step 7. Also, keep in mind that a hero's threat cost is only counted during set up, for the remainder of the game it is irrelevant and therefore could not be counted when the prisoner is freed.\n\n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63886-prisoner-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=624548","commentId":624548,"userName":"Agesilaos","timestamp":1335870919,"content":"HI Titan,\n\nthanks for the prompt reply and the answers, much appreciated!

Are you playing single player? If so i believe it is one of the hardest! You may benefit from gettng some more adventure packs to broaden your card base for making a deck to beat this single player!\n\n If your playing multi-player, good luck! It is still tough but not insurmountable!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/63886-prisoner-in-escape-from-dol-guldur/?do=findComment&comment=625100","commentId":625100,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1335965133,"content":"Yeah, this is not a quest that scales well for solo players. In co-op, losing one hero out of six or more isn't nearly as big a deal. In solo, one out of three is tough. You are essentially playing a secrecy deck without the benefits of the low threat. Still, I wish you luck!"}]}
