A player may run as many copies of his chosen restricted card as the standard rules of the game (or card text) allow.\"\n\nDoes TLotR: TCG have any cards that should go on this list?  \n\nI think there are a pair of cards that that cause the game to be, well, gamed.  The two cards are Will of the West [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/will-of-the-west-core] and Galadhrim's Greeting [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/core/the-galadhrims-greeting-core].\n\nmed_will-of-the-west-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_will-of-the-west-core.jpg]  med_the-galadhrims-greeting-core.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/med_the-galadhrims-greeting-core.jpg]\n\nThe addition of these two cards to the Restricted List would not prevent anyone from using either card or even having either card in the same game but in different decks.  Any thoughts or other potential candidates?\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48337-lcg-restricted-list-lotr-potential-candidates/?do=findComment&comment=484775","commentId":484775,"userName":"BoundForGlory","timestamp":1307986979,"content":"If they do not include a turn count in the scoring mechanism (other than the +1 threat each turn that is built into the game), then those two cards are good candidates for a restricted list.\n\nBut if they add a strong enough turn count factor to the score, then they won't have to worry about those two cards.  Their benefit would not outweigh the number of turns it takes to use them effectively.\n\nSomething like \"+10 points per round\" added to the score might work.\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48337-lcg-restricted-list-lotr-potential-candidates/?do=findComment&comment=484804","commentId":484804,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1307992113,"content":" We're starting this already?

There are too many encounter cards that add big chunks of threat to a player's pool, and they come in different variations. Pursued by Shadow is a treachery that could add a large number if you only rely on one or two strong characters for questing and the Hill Troll is an enemy that might add a couple of his own. Right now there are so many ways to add threat, and really only two ways to reduce it: The Galadhrim's Greeting and Gandalf.\n\nAs for Will of the West, it allows you to recycle your deck, but unless you also have a great amount of card drawing power, there is some risk here too. You may be hoping to get Gandalf that extra time, but he could end up at the bottom of the deck. Also, with nightmare mode being played, this is almost essential."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48337-lcg-restricted-list-lotr-potential-candidates/?do=findComment&comment=484880","commentId":484880,"userName":"BoundForGlory","timestamp":1308008239,"content":"I would greatly prefer a fix to the scoring system over a restricted list.  To (mis)quote Aragorn:\n\nA day may come when the cardpool of the game fails, when we forsake the cards that break the bonds of this game.
