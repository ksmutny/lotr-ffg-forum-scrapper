I know it is a bit of a read, and I’m not really expecting anyone to make it through the whole thing, no matter how many sittings they set aside for it. However this is my favourite part of The Fellowship of the Ring (book and film), and I wanted to do it justice. Feel free to skip it if you just want to stick to the core of the scenario’s narrative, but this really has been a labour of love for me and I’m glad I’ve put it together.\n\nhttps://theroadlotr.wordpress.com/2018/06/08/the-council-of-...
