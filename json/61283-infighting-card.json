It just represents the idea that the enemies don't always work together. Mechanically, it allows you to shift some amount of damage from one enemy to put it on another.\n\nAs an example, you have a Hill Troll and a random Orc in the staging area. Gandalf enters play and does 4 damage to the Hill Troll. Both enemies remain in the staging area, but you have Dunhere. He can't attack for enough to break the Hill Troll's defenses, but he can put 2 damage counters on the Orc, so you do 2 damage to it. Infighting lets you move those 2 damage over to the Hill Troll. Play Gandalf again on the next turn, and you can kill it before it even gets out of the staging area.\n\nInfighting is for moving those damage tokens to where they're most effective."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/61283-infighting-card/?do=findComment&comment=601507","commentId":601507,"userName":"aeazel","timestamp":1330740452,"content":"Had one scenario where my partner and I had ensnared a Marsh Adder, done quite a bit of damage to it, and then transferred it all (believe it was Carrock, so we transferred it to one of the trolls). Great card when there are high defense/hit point enemies that aren't immediately breathing down your neck.\n\nAlso can be incredibly useful if you are dealing with snipers/enemies who refuse to leave the staging area."}]}
