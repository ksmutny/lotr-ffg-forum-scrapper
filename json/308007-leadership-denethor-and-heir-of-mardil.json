Basically unless you went and took a new resource token from the bank Heir of Mardil won't trigger. I am imagining things or do I remember this correctly?\n\nI know about Rule Clarification 1.25 from the online FAQ but the fourth paragraph seems to contradict Caleb's affirmation.\n\nEdited April 27 by Alonewolf87"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/308007-leadership-denethor-and-heir-of-mardil/?do=findComment&comment=3931562","commentId":3931562,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1587997568,"content":"From the FAQ:\n\nGaining a resource is a blanket term that includes collecting, adding and moving. Any time the number of resources in a hero’s pool is increased, that hero has gained one or more resources.\n\nSo LeDenethor/Bifur/Errand-Rider and so forth will work to trigger it.\n\nEdit: sorry, I missed that you referenced it already.  But even if Caleb said this at a con, and said it after FAQ 1.9 was released, I'm not inclined to accept private verbal statements directly contradicting the written FAQ as a ruling.\n\nEdited April 27 by dalestephenson"}]}
