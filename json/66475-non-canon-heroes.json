I could cite many objections, but in brief: the first one was quite promising but I rapidly became annoyed by the way Jackson's adaptation handled a number of key characters and situations, stripping them (in my view) of subtlely and nobility. Examples: Gimli (becomes a stock comedy dwarf), Denethor (just a mad fool), Faramir, Elrond (now just hates Men, and also somehow manages to teleport to Dunharrow!)\n\nI actually think the Hobbit films will be better because the tone of the books is better suited to Jackson's knockabout approach.\n\nPS Rich - do you know the old BBC radio dramatisation? I am just relistening to that childhood favourite - I think it is really pretty good. The scriptwriters even delved into Unfinished Tales for some of their material BUT they did axe Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-downs…"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649143","commentId":649143,"userName":"Robert McMutton","timestamp":1340591105,"content":" I agree with both of you, richsabre and jjeagle.

Most of the restrains that held the LotR will no longer be there. I think Jackson loves and knows the work. Yes, he's made some strange choices but he's done some very good ones, like casting Sean Bean or Ian McKellen in major roles when we could have got stars (by standards of then) instead. And I like the casting for this one even better, Freeman, Armitage, Cumberbatch are all great and non-populistic choices.\n\nAlso the amount of work that was put into the movies is beyond any other film project it seems; from planting gardens in the Shire long before shooting, to making every piece of armour; and the outcome shows. And the music is easilly one of the most memorable in cinematic history. Some of the scenes, like the charge of the Rohirrim in either of the latter two films, are just wonderful. And so is the tense and emotional action in Moria or on Amon Hen.\n\nStill I think the movies deserved six volumes to fit the material because when you look at it, much was cut off, and much was simplified. And I think the movies could easilly stand on their own if made after each book (of which there are six).\n\nThat's why I'm happy they're making two films off the Hobbit because it lessens the chances we get simplified characters, indeed as Denethor or Elrond were in the LotR (as much as I like the actors who portrayed, especially Weaving)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649404","commentId":649404,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1340632829,"content":"lleimmoen said:\n\nAlso the amount of work that was put into the movies is beyond any other film project it seems; from planting gardens in the Shire long before shooting, to making every piece of armour; and the outcome shows.

Personally, I think the movies are excellent. As mentioned above, I find that many of Tolkien's plot twists are difficult to incorporate in movies. The Tom Bombadil part, for example, I'm not sure if it would have been boring, as Rich suggested, but it is just irrelevant in terms of the main storyline. With 3 movies clocking in at or near 3 hours long, some things have to go.\n\nAnother thing that is difficult to incorporate is characters that play a key role, but are around only briefly. Hence why Glorfindel is nowhere to be found or for that matter, Erkenbrand in Two Towers. Instead they give Arwen and Eomer more to do, so as to have more continuity. I can understand why purists don't like it, but I think overall it works fine. The one thing I've never really understood is why the elves come to Helm's Deep, since they don't make that much of a difference, they all die there and that particular change never seems to really build into anything else. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649502","commentId":649502,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1340643986,"content":"i think with the elves it was a way to show how they 'came to the aid of men' instead of buggering off to the undying lands…..which of course didnt happens anyways as the elves played a major part in holding off dol guldur during the war of the ring, held the fellowship in lothlorien (and of course with legolas) and ive also a feeling that either galadriel of elrond was responsible for sending the grey company, which of course had the twins present at the pelennor and morannon\n\nthe whole point of the lord of the rings and elves was that tolkien was making a point- the 3rd age was the age of men, and the elves were dwindling which makes the whole thing of them coming to helms deep strange as jackson addressed this point through the rather moody and ignorant version of elrond when he states to gandalf that the ages of elves is over and gandalf says 'we must look to men' there fore its then contadictory to have them fly in action movie style at the last moment only to get slaughtered…..\n\nalso while we're on the subject, does no one think the soldiers of gondor were portrayed as patheticly bad at fighting, compared to rohan. i mean i know they were up against 100,000 orcs wheres rohan had it a bit easier, but c'mon, they were the descendants of numenor, had the best armor and weapons, they could at least have taken a few orcs down with them haha"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=649539","commentId":649539,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1340646890,"content":"I certainly can agree to that.

Or when on many shows, someone does CPR for a couple of seconds and brings back someone from the brink as if nothing had happened.\n\nTo be completely off topic, I found Gladiator did have some subtle nods, though. For example, the emperor Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix) actually did fight as a gladiator, in what is suspected were \"fixed\" contests. Or in the opening battle, when the barbarians fire their arrows at the oncoming romans, and you see them using their shields in a particular way to cover in front and above themselves, a roman battle technique knows as \"testudo\" (turtle).\n\n\n\nTo further this tangent…\n\nI recall after Gladiator came out and people were asking (or sometimes assuming!) that Commodus was really killed in the arena and that Russel's character was a historical figure."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=650469","commentId":650469,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1340790571,"content":"To come back to the Elves at Helm's Deep.

He really did. However, I think Peter Jackson was right to do so. By making Faramir weaker, he made the Ring stronger. One of the really REALLY difficult things to convey about the story, especially in a visual medium like film, is the power and menace that is manifest in a tiny little inanimate object. If film Faramir had acted like book Faramir then I think it would have significantly weakened the power of the Ring that they had been trying to build up. A lot of dramatic tension could have been lost right then and there.

Certainly the films increased awareness of and interest in the book dramatically. But Tolkien was not an obscure writer beforehand.

When confronted with the ring, Faramir could have simply kept glancing back at the ring. Instead of taking the Hobbits to Osgiliath, he could have led them through the forest, the whole time sneaking glances at Frodo. The audience members that don't know Faramir's character would suspect treachery, and those who are familiar would see that the ring is drawing him in without him ever giving in to it. I think a simple thing like making sure he keeps looking back to Frodo or the ring would effectively portray the power of the ring without destroying Faramir's character."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/66475-non-canon-heroes/?do=findComment&comment=655344","commentId":655344,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1341755580,"content":"gatharion said:\n\nA Silmirilion TV show or movie(s)?
