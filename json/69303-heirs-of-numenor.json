Minas Morgul, the city of the Witch-King, was far in the past the Eastern Minas Ithil (Tower of the Moon) to Minas Anor (Tower of the Sun), later Minas Tirith (Tower of the Citadel/Guard) in the West. All of Ithilien used to be the possession of Gondor, but lands west of the Anduin gradually succumbed to Mordor's rising power. The once great city of knowledge and capital city of Gondor, Osgiliath, fell in TA 2475 to uruks, and the Great Bridge was destroyed. Boromir regained the city in TA 3018, which was lost during the War of the Ring (TA 3018-19). The city may or may not have been rebuilt in the Fourth Age under Elessar/Aragorn (richsabre would you like to edit/add here?)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69303-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=676657","commentId":676657,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1345381200,"content":"good stuff john…also id add the power of the southrons  which are given a mention in the pack! also there was the corsairs of Umbar for gondor to contend with\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/69303-heirs-of-numenor/?do=findComment&comment=676666","commentId":676666,"userName":"player1761766","timestamp":1345382322,"content":"richsabre said:\n\ngood stuff john…also id add the power of the southrons  which are given a mention in the pack! also there was the corsairs of Umbar for gondor to contend with\n\nrich\n\n\n\nAh, Southrons!

I'd bet that we get the LotR Saga over 3-4 years, here's my thoughts as to how the next year of releases looks:\n\nBattle of Lake-Town; Hobbit II; HoN (Deluxe); HoN (cycle); FotR Saga I?; Gen-Con 2013 PoD?; FotR Saga II?, etc.\n\nThis seems reasonable.

I've also thought that between this game and A Game of Thrones lcg, storywise it would be more appropiate if they had \"changed\" systems. I'll explain. While we see little stories and adventures in Lotr lcg and following a strict timeline, in AGOT lcg we have a vague take on the storyline, seeing the main story in broad terms but often returning to random minor plots in previous books and having \"earlier\" versions of characters in the new sets and returning characters that were dead, etc. A general, more free take on the story, which I think would fit Lotr better. While on the other hand, Lotr lcg's chapter-driven and episodic nature fits the ASOIAF novels better. Just a thought.\n\nAnd I envy you. I wish I could see the game the same as you.
