However, it seems like you're kind of coming in towards the middle of some larger battle. I'm wondering if there is some sort of Ranger mission in Ithilien as the second scenario where you're trying to warn or make your way to Cair Andros.\n\nJust some thoughts.

I believe it might be different from stage to stage, like Siege, Battle, normal. But I definitelly hope Siege and Battle are important - and will be carried on for quite some time. It might be the best way to make Tactics shine. (I was thinking of something like this ever since the treachery card in Dead Marshes that made you use Attack instead of Willpower for the escape test; now it is here, hurray.)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71198-battles-and-battlegrounds-tactics-delight/?do=findComment&comment=695789","commentId":695789,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347944444,"content":"yes i dont think all stages shall be siege or battle, and i hope that we have half of the quests standard 'journey/adventure' quests\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71198-battles-and-battlegrounds-tactics-delight/?do=findComment&comment=695872","commentId":695872,"userName":"Cunir","timestamp":1347956962,"content":"if they're going to start using attack for questing, maybe they will start to use will for something else as well.\n\nmaybe they could introduce a \"fear\" type of thing. certain locations and enemies might be so fearful that it damages us, or makes our characters exhaust so they cant do anything. and the only way to combat that would be to have characters with a high will. i think that would be quite a good and thematic new use for will.\n\ni can imagine a big battle in the next cycle where the nazgul swoop down. it would be good if all our lowly characters freeze up, and only the brave ones with high will carry on fighting"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71198-battles-and-battlegrounds-tactics-delight/?do=findComment&comment=695877","commentId":695877,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1347957421,"content":"Cunir said:\n\nif they're going to start using attack for questing, maybe they will start to use will for something else as well.\n\nmaybe they could introduce a \"fear\" type of thing. certain locations and enemies might be so fearful that it damages us, or makes our characters exhaust so they cant do anything. and the only way to combat that would be to have characters with a high will. i think that would be quite a good and thematic new use for will.\n\ni can imagine a big battle in the next cycle where the nazgul swoop down. it would be good if all our lowly characters freeze up, and only the brave ones with high will carry on fighting\n\n\n\nI think you are right in that we shall see new ways of using willpower (perhaps similar to what we saw in the Redhorn Gate). However, I don't think the theme of the game is to equal fear with low willpower. Certainly characters like Beorn could not be viewed as fearful. I believe, thematically, willpower could be viewed more like commitment to a certain goal (quest)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71198-battles-and-battlegrounds-tactics-delight/?do=findComment&comment=695894","commentId":695894,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1347959349,"content":"perhaps the fear could take all of the stats together and then take a total result….still heros like glorfindel would be lower this way, which is obviously thematically wrong\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/71198-battles-and-battlegrounds-tactics-delight/?do=findComment&comment=696002","commentId":696002,"userName":"klaymen_sk","timestamp":1347968693,"content":"This looks awesome!
