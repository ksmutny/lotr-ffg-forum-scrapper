In AGoT LCG there are several versions of some of the bigger characters. However that other Aragorn you saw was more likely an earlier version of the current core set one.

I've seen other games where blocks go into the past or the future. Although, this might be a bit blasphemous to hard core LOTR fans. I was surprised to see Gandalf as an ally not a hero. Perhaps they could remake him as \"Gandalf the White\". Gandalf ally cards not playable if he is in the deck. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45570-eventual-different-versions-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=457279","commentId":457279,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1303412669,"content":"I dont' realy have a promblem Gandalf be an ally but they could make him play like Beorn.You can have Gandalf all the time in your area but if you use his special abilities you must discard him at the end of the phase/round."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45570-eventual-different-versions-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=457303","commentId":457303,"userName":"faith_star83","timestamp":1303417823,"content":"I think we will see different versions of the characters and I really hope we do! Characters like Gandalf and Gimli are very powerful in the world of lotr. So the version we see now only covers one of their various talents. In a future version we might have the same character with a different ability (one of their many other talents).\n\nBut I guess it will take some time, since there will only ever be one new hero per adventure pack!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45570-eventual-different-versions-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=457344","commentId":457344,"userName":"qwertyuiop","timestamp":1303424361,"content":"Acererak said:\n\nDo you guys really think the time span of this game really allows for diferent Hero versions?\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\nIt's possible.  Although don't expect to see an eight year old version of Eowyn from the first of the seventeen year span. :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png].  The time line looks to be a bit of a mash up, and having played MECCG, I can dig it.  If you bought the game with Gimli and Legolas as part of the same starter deck,  you've signed up for a bit of leniency as far as chronology goes.\n\nI can't wait to try Bilbo in a 4 player game, and I look forward to Boromir arriving on the scene. The foreshadowing is there!\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45570-eventual-different-versions-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=457413","commentId":457413,"userName":"Mighty Jim 83","timestamp":1303443738,"content":"As disappointing as it is to have an Ally Gandalf, with the stats he's been given he'd have to have a ridiculously high threat cost as a hero not to break the game.\n\nThe way he appears for one round, saves everyone's skin, then disappears seems to fit in well with the narrative of the hobbit."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45570-eventual-different-versions-of-characters/?do=findComment&comment=457488","commentId":457488,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1303458226,"content":"Mighty Jim said:\n\nThe way he appears for one round, saves everyone's skin, then disappears seems to fit in well with the narrative of the hobbit.\n\n\n\nThat was my first comment wen i first saw Gandlaf's card two months ago but for people like me who like Gandalf and he is their favorite character only one round is a short time to enjoy Gandalf.I use 3x sneak attack and 3x Gandalf in my deck so i can have  him as much time as i can.\n\nI wish for a different version of Gandalf cause i want have him in my area all the timebabeo.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/babeo.gif]."}]}
