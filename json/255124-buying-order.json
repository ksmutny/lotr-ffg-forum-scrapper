If you are sure to keep playing the game, grap a good deal if you see one (you could even just wait to play it until you have the rest).

They ship to Australia and New Zealand for free, at least. I have found them to be reliable. They are the one of the preferred ways to purchase LoTR expansions in this part of the world (Australia) since their prices are the best (for us). The only thing to watch out for is that they sometimes show the English cover art for Spanish LoTR expansions, so check the language. A lot of people got caught out and bought Spanish Khazad Dum by mistake.\n\nI am of the impression that they are a warehouse of sorts, and probably purchase in bulk lots when stock is available. So their stock comes and goes. But I have purchased 2 expansions and  a full cycle from them (with 2 more expansions on the boat) and not yet had a problem.\n\nBut if you are in the US then you have more purchasing options than people elsewhere in the world, for whom shipping costs are often prohibitive, so you might find better prices domestically.\n\nEdited July 28, 2017 by jnicol"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/255124-buying-order/?do=findComment&comment=2903949","commentId":2903949,"userName":"Schrodinger&#039;s Hat","timestamp":1501294166,"content":"I've bought from book depository maybe ~50 times. About a dozen of those were LOTR LCG packs. \n\nOverall they are very reliable. Shipping isn't fast (2-ish weeks usually) but it's free. I've had two items not show up in the delivery window, and in both cases they've immediately offered a refund, no hassles (one showed up two days late, and for the other I took the refund). \n\nThere have been two times where I've ordered an item and then they've said a day later that it's no longer in stock, I'm guessing because multiple people have ordered at once. In both cases my refund was processed in less than 24 hours. \n\nTL:DR- they are safe and reliable to order from. "}]}
