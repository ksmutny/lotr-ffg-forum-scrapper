First of all, we're not borrowing from some 12 year-olds D&D homebrew of \"New Dwarfistan\", this is Tolkien: there's plenty of material. Second of all, I'm confident that the developers at FFG can rise to the scholastic challenge of googling a little background and creating plausible content. The whole point of seperating them into factions is that it creates a new targetable and it prevents the potentially unbalancing effect of each new Dwarf card. "}]}
