Even though I fear it was not meant for the combo to work.\n\n \n\n \n\nActually, what is strange - or it might be on purpose - is that the enemy and player's attack breakdown are different, as shown in pages 18 and 20 of the rulebook. In both cases, Actions can be played at the end (and even restricting to only the \"end\" may be an error) of attack resolution steps. However, when the enemy attacks, determining combat damage and deal damage is one step. It is uninterrupted, atomic. On the other hand, when player attacks, attack strength and determining/applying damage are separate, therefore allowing to do actions that change character conditions between these two steps, without affecting the calculated attack strength.\n\nFurthermore, when enemy attacks, if a defending character leaves play before damage is assigned, then the attack is undefended. Conversely, there is not this restriction when player is attacking. The pendent should say that if a character is removed before combat damage is assigned, attack strength is reduced in accordance. But there is no rule sa such.\n\nThis asymetry in resolving attacks might be by design though."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56551-help-me-nate-french-youre-my-only-hope-meneldors-flight-combos/?do=findComment&comment=558953","commentId":558953,"userName":"Titan","timestamp":1321973034,"content":"I have read it, and while I understand his point of view, I simply cannot agree with it. I don't think there is a window between attack resolution and the forced effect of a card that triggers off it. I could see it working if step 2 was resolved and the Vassal did not have to stick around for step 3. But I don't see how step 2 is resolution, step 3 is. Some guidance on this is that if a defender leaves play before damage is assigned, the attack is considered undefended. You could then argue that if an attacking character leaves play before damage is assigned, his attack, likewise, does not count.

The problem is that, as per the rules, you may remove an attacker through actions before assigning damage and thus resolving the attack completely, and still keep the same attack strength. Otherwise, why have they split step 2 and step 3? What is the point here to allow actions to interrupt attack strength determination and damage assignation?

While nothing specifically prevents this, it seems counterintuitive. Then again, the ruling on Stand and Fight seems completely counterintuitive to me without a change to it's text.\n\nIt may also be that these two steps are separated for further clarification. In this game, attack values are constantly being modified. They use one step to clearly delineate what the total amount of damage you can deal is, and the next to determine how that amount is modified as per the enemy's defense value and any effects it may have. Since, as opposed to enemies, you can attack one target with multiple characters, they may have felt the need for an extra step. This is all, of course, pure speculation on my part. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56551-help-me-nate-french-youre-my-only-hope-meneldors-flight-combos/?do=findComment&comment=559277","commentId":559277,"userName":"zeb","timestamp":1322031815,"content":"Titan said:\n\n \n\nPerhaps I'm reading too much into it, but step 3 talks about the combined damage of all the attacking characters.
