Same willpower and although Gildor has better attack and defense he is best used as a quester/defender so will usually only be questing for 3 like Firyal. His ability although really great requires you to exhaust him whereas Firyal's ability activates when you commit her to the quest so can be used every turn while also making use of her 3 willpower at the same time.\n\nEdited December 6, 2016 by PsychoRocka"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236241-wild-lands-and-strange-visions/?do=findComment&comment=2528535","commentId":2528535,"userName":"JonG","timestamp":1481025875,"content":"I thought it was a nice article.

Tolkien and why I continue to love this game. His themes are readily applicable and no game is values neutral. Playing a game that is cooperative and based on Tolkien's themes therefore exercises, however discreetly, our capacity for fellowship and moral imagination.\n\n \n\nOver the years, many have remarked on the quality of the community around the LOTR LCG. Given a genuinely wholesome source material and how carefully the designers have undertaken to bring it to life, I think that is no coincidence.\n\n \n\nThanks for reading my article and being such a great company of adventurers to follow!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/236241-wild-lands-and-strange-visions/?do=findComment&comment=2534852","commentId":2534852,"userName":"Lecitadin","timestamp":1481311476,"content":"Wow!
