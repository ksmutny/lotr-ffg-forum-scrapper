This time it included the back story of Amarthuil and I read that too. Then I went and looked at the player cards in more detail. When I got to Amarthuil I stopped confused. \"Wait, what?\" And I went back to Amarthuil's story again. \"Nope. Amarthuil is supposed to be a guy.\"\n\nSo I flipped the card to my wife, who doesn't play, and asked, \"Man or woman?\"\n\n\"Woman. She has b@@bs. And the hips and thighs too.\"\n\nWhen you get your cards let me know what you think. I'm starting to wonder about real backstory of Amarthuil. (In development I mean.) Was the three hit points because he was a she?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192935-dude-looks-like-a-lady/?do=findComment&comment=1880246","commentId":1880246,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1446741772,"content":"Hmm.

Stop arguing. \n\n\"Stop arguing.\" Truly your grasp of rhetoric is staggering. This whole argument is pretty dumb to begin with since I'm pretty sure the designers didn't intend Amarthiul to be trans in either direction, but between the two options in this hypothetical I personally feel the option wherein every other character and the impartial narration written by the designers aren't ignorant and bigoted is the preferable one.\n\nNot to mention it's pretty weird that you're arguing so vehemently for him being female while still referring to him as male and thus lumping yourself in with the very ignorant old people you're condemning."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192935-dude-looks-like-a-lady/?do=findComment&comment=1882983","commentId":1882983,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1446838166,"content":"> This whole argument is pretty dumb to begin with.\n\nExactly the reason you should stop arguing.
