So if you had four unexhausted characters in play, you could use two to defend against one engaged enemy and two to defend against another. That's a great card!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45420-card-rules-clarifications-needed/?do=findComment&comment=456333","commentId":456333,"userName":"ClydeCloggie","timestamp":1303286672,"content":"Especially since you can play it without cost."}]}
