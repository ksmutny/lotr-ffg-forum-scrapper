I would say that defeated refers to any damage caused by combat and destroyed would refer to discarding your own characters with the effects of your own cards. There is, however, a bit of a gray area here and that is what about opposing card effects? What happens if you lose a hero due to the effect of The Necromancer's Reach, for example? My understanding on Eastern Crows is that if they are killed by an effect like Thalin's, they do go back to the encounter deck, which would mean they are defeated, not destroyed. Following that logic, then if any of your heroes are killed by an opposing card effect, they would be considered defeated. \n\n1) I believe that this means Boromir would be considered destroyed and therefore would combo with Landroval's effect. In fact, these two cards seem made for each other.\n\n2) As mentioned above, I think it would mean the Crows are defeated and therefore go back to the encounter deck."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52557-discarded-defeated-destroyed/?do=findComment&comment=523171","commentId":523171,"userName":"radiskull","timestamp":1314927455,"content":"Titan said:\n\n1) I believe that this means Boromir would be considered destroyed and therefore would combo with Landroval's effect.

In CoC discarding a character from play is called sacrificing a character and is a separate game effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/52557-discarded-defeated-destroyed/?do=findComment&comment=523181","commentId":523181,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1314930248,"content":"df90DAIN2 said:\n\nWhat are the exact definitions of these cards in the rules, and what do these words mean when it comes to the following cards:\n\n1) The upcoming Boromir hero reads: \"Action: Discard Boromir to deal 2 damage to each enemy engaged with a single player.\"   Heroes can't be \"placed in the discard pile\" so would he be destroyed?

Only remove from the game make card go aside instead to the discard pile. Heroes card aslo go to discard pile when discarded or defeated but heroes cards dont belong to discard pile. So if you shuffle your discard pile back to your player deck heroes cards will stay in discard pile.\n\nSo different between discard and defeated : the card effect of landrovar will not work in case of Boromir ability cose is discarded not defeated.

Tight wording wasn't a concern of the designer (the difference in wording between Legolas and Blade of Gondolin was the first red flag that this was going to be messy).
