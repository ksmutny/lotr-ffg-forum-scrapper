Followed by Night is an odd example because you can always resolve either effect. That’s because it targets either ‘all allies’ or ‘all enemies’ and the word ‘all’ can include 0.\"\n\n \n\nThat's from this thread [https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/126831-quick-question-followed-by-night/].  So to recap: when choosing an effect, you have to do one that can be FULLY resolved.  But because of how Followed by Night is worded, you are always able to FULLY resolve either effect."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/192281-followed-by-night/?do=findComment&comment=1867731","commentId":1867731,"userName":"PsychoRocka","timestamp":1446007001,"content":"this question gets asked quite often on the forums, you actually can choose either option because of the way the card is worded.
