So seeing as one of the best parts of this game is that it gives a fresh non-peter jackson-view of tolkiens creation, how do you think the balrog will be portrayed?\n\n \n\npersonally i think the minotaur-ish portrayal is what we will see- which is great, it certainly not wrong, however it would be nice to see something a little different. for instance it was nice to see aragorn carrying narsil in the hero picture"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/58043-about-the-balrogs-portrayal/?do=findComment&comment=571474","commentId":571474,"userName":"booored","timestamp":1324920810,"content":"it will be like jacksons, huge and monsterish with wings.

You could use him (it?) as is, but most people used one of the three mode cards available. Sadly, most also only used the Great Shadow Balrog, as it was easily the best from a gaming standpoint. Fiery Balrog or Slimy One could both be built around, but lacked the ridiculous power of the Shadow one (who was basically improved Sauron). Further, there were two hazard versions of it, Balrog of Moria and Durin's Bane.
