Then have the smaller mats for each other player. Even in 2 player we have two smaller mats off to each side to make room for spread onto this mat and heavy staging areas. I find the 1-4 player perfectÂ for solo, ok for 2 and otherwise a staging area. The JIME mat is the one to get if you just want one mat but I think FFG intentionally released this smaller so that you want to pick up more of their mats haha.Â "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307853-fellowship-1-4-player-gamemat/?do=findComment&comment=3929538","commentId":3929538,"userName":"wernerkellens","timestamp":1587444178,"content":"> 5 hours ago, player3351457 said:\n> \n> That's the only way it makes sense to me\n\nPossible ðŸ¤”"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307853-fellowship-1-4-player-gamemat/?do=findComment&comment=3929742","commentId":3929742,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1587509491,"content":"> 18 hours ago, wernerkellens said:\n> \n> Possible ðŸ¤”\n\nI play with the mat plus the 2 player starter one and that's usually barely enough room for 3 people."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307853-fellowship-1-4-player-gamemat/?do=findComment&comment=3929761","commentId":3929761,"userName":"Valhalla Gaming","timestamp":1587516916,"content":"I always just use that as the staging area and everything related to the quest itself.
