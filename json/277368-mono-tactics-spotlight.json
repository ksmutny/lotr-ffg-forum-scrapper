What decks or heroes make you immediately interested to see more when a person starts talking about a deck?\n\nfor example whenever I see leadership Faramir I know I have to look at the deck because I haven’t built a deck I like with him in it yet."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277368-mono-tactics-spotlight/?do=findComment&comment=3368082","commentId":3368082,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1528568448,"content":"I’ll be more likely to look at a deck when it contains uncommon heroes, or heroes that don’t build decks all by themselves. If I see tactics Imrahil there’s a good chance I’ve seen some version of that deck before.  If I see, say, Fastred and no Dunhere, I’m probably gonna think “hey now, what’s this?”"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/277368-mono-tactics-spotlight/?do=findComment&comment=3368084","commentId":3368084,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1528568560,"content":"Hah, I wrote that before I clicked on your link.

I have a fastred with leadership faramir deck that might interest you both :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]\n\ni also like decks that bring fun or unusual themes. A while back someone, sorry I forget who, posted a deck that used loads of pipes, and I really liked that one!

I would reshuffle him into the deck if I pull him with imrahil but didn’t use Riddermark knights ability. So the point being since he’s not sticking around might as well use that attack if you need it. Sorry it wasn’t more clear!\n\nYou are right you can’t get him back from the discard!"}]}
