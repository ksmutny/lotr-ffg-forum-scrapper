I notice the transcribed text on lotrlcg.com is missing the discard part, but its plain as can be on the card. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nObvious strategy musings:\n\nThe discard pile is naturally the better choice allowing further Athelas cards (purposely avoiding the plural of Athelas, you try it >.<) to appear from the encounter deck. Unless perhaps if you have another Forest Grove available to explore next and theres only one Athalas in the discard, then you could select from one from the encounter deck allowing yourself two assured Athelas."}]}
