I discard them immediately for that reason but usually place a token as a reminder on the affected cards.\n\nEdited August 16, 2018 by Network57"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/281110-when-to-discard-long-lasting-event-cards/?do=findComment&comment=3442755","commentId":3442755,"userName":"tripecac","timestamp":1534429860,"content":"Thanks!"}]}
