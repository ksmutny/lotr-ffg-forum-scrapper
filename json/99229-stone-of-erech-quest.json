If you make up your decks right, it's still a challenge, but you feel like you can handle whatever comes at you. Compare that to say Into Ithilien or Siege of Cair Andros and it was a huge relief. A lot of fun!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99229-stone-of-erech-quest/?do=findComment&comment=984740","commentId":984740,"userName":"Bullroarer Took","timestamp":1392352928,"content":"> It's an extremely enjoyable quest and not nearly as brutal and unmerciful as Massing at Osgiliath and the Battle of Lake-town.
