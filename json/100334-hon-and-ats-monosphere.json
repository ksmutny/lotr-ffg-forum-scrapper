Some of them this worked out better than others. I know I really liked it when like Orc Arbelesters or The Master's Malice would show up.

Sometimes you need threat reduction in a fighting deck or healing in an Outlands deck or whatever.  And yeah, they are difficult. I played Peril in Pelargir two-player the other day nearly five times and we lost each time. Bad luck, or just bad deck building on my part? Probably the second.  :wacko: [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wacko.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100334-hon-and-ats-monosphere/?do=findComment&comment=999799","commentId":999799,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1393701555,"content":"Everything except Into Ithilien with mono Spirit and mono Tactics.\n\n \n\nEdit: Correction, I used mono Lore and mono Leadership for Druadan Forest\n\nEdited March 1, 2014 by Raven1015"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/100334-hon-and-ats-monosphere/?do=findComment&comment=999838","commentId":999838,"userName":"camacazio","timestamp":1393706101,"content":"Works well two-player for different tasks, and its a fun change from trying to do everything in one deck.
