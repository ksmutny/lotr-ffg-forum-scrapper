I got at the point to play the Riddle scenario ... and I have a question\n\n \n\n \n\n-Can I use cards like warden of healing to heal points on Bilbo ? \n\n \n\n-Can I play treasure or Baggins event cards for Bilbo whil he is in the riddles area ?\n\n \n\nthanks !! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89499-hobbits-saga-riddles-area-question/?do=findComment&comment=854199","commentId":854199,"userName":"Rainelotr","timestamp":1377882614,"content":"From what I remember no to the first question. I'm fairly certain Bilbo is considered outside of the play area of the rest of the heroes, and thus cannot be affected by the likes of Warden of Healing. \n\n \n\nBaggins event cards and stuff like Sting is fair game.\n\n \n\nBut it HAS been a while since I've played through to this part of the Hobbit quests. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89499-hobbits-saga-riddles-area-question/?do=findComment&comment=854202","commentId":854202,"userName":"Nickpes","timestamp":1377883034,"content":"thanks rainelotr ... thats what I believed also but wanted to be sure "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89499-hobbits-saga-riddles-area-question/?do=findComment&comment=854914","commentId":854914,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1377986685,"content":"I believe it follows the rules of a separate staging area.\n\nI don't think Sting works as a result."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89499-hobbits-saga-riddles-area-question/?do=findComment&comment=854977","commentId":854977,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1377996996,"content":"Yeah I think he is totally on his own, no Sting or anything. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89499-hobbits-saga-riddles-area-question/?do=findComment&comment=854991","commentId":854991,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1377998409,"content":"Yes, that's correct Rapier and GrandSpleen, because Gollum only has 2 attack. So if you got Sting on to Bilbo, he would be immune to Gollum's attacks, and you wouldn't have to worry about that anymore. Which also means that Baggins sphere cards can't be used on him either. He's completely immune to all player cards. \n\n \n\nQuote from The Hobbit: Over Hill and Under Hill Rulesheet under The Riddle Area section:\n\n \n\n\"Cards in the riddle area (including Bilbo Baggins) are\n\nimmune to player card effects and cannot leave the riddle\narea except through specific quest card effects. While\nGollum is in the riddle area, he does not contribute his\nthreat during the quest phase and cannot be engaged by\nthe players. While Bilbo Baggins is in the riddle area, the\nfirst player still controls him; however, he cannot quest,\nattack, take damage from cards other than Gollum, have\nattachments played on him by the players, or defend\n(except against Gollum).\"\nEdited September 1, 2013 by legolas18"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89499-hobbits-saga-riddles-area-question/?do=findComment&comment=855026","commentId":855026,"userName":"Rainelotr","timestamp":1378003518,"content":"thanks for the clarification"}]}
