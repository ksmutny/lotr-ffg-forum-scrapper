That would actually be fair-square, since I only need to buy each chapter pack once.\n\nAs for 1) I think the most player friendly option would be a PoD method that allowed us to directly purchase the singles we need. For FFG maybe a \"complementary core set expansion\" type of product would be good. Just providing the cards necessary to have set of 3s of all the core set cards.\n\nBuying multiple core sets seems such a waste though...multiple quest and hero cards don't seem very useful. Still I can understand the collector's to wish to own all cards in sets of 3 no matter what ;-)\n\nPersonally I will start with one core and should I really want some of the cards in sets of 3 I will try to trade or - as a last resort - buy another core set.

Ebay seems like the best way to go here. \n\nI like TroyMK1's idea about the 2 heroes from the \"main\" sphere one from a \"minor\" sphere. I'll almost certainly use that idea, after I give the basic (30 cards, one sphere) game a try. I'm thinking Legolas, Gimli,Eowyn; my favorites from the books. \n\nI also like the idea of a 4 player game, one sphere each. I'd hate to be the Lore player, though. I'm not a big fan of the Lore characters so far. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/44069-anybody-have-a-set-list/?do=findComment&comment=443572","commentId":443572,"userName":"sisyphus5","timestamp":1301005544,"content":"DrNate said:\n\n \n\n \n\nI also like the idea of a 4 player game, one sphere each.

But if you have less than four players, at least one player will want to combine two spheres in her deck. Solo play will be very tricky, I guess."}]}
