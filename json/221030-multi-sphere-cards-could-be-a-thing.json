Some cards already give extra benefits when yourself or other players pay an extra toll of other spheres to use it. Do you think this might open the door to multi-sphere cards.

Wherein the card can be used with just one sphere but has more stuff if used as a multi-sphere card. Most of the cards that have the two sphere abilities on them also are co-op friendly with multiple players sharing the costs. I'm not sure making plain multi-sphere cards would have as wide a reach. Saying that I'd love to see a neutral card that costs 2 or something and has different effects listed in its box depending on what sphere resources you spent on them."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221030-multi-sphere-cards-could-be-a-thing/?do=findComment&comment=2238869","commentId":2238869,"userName":"banania","timestamp":1464418953,"content":"I'd say that neutral cards are already the multisphere cards in this games, and we need more of them, especially allies and Istaris."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221030-multi-sphere-cards-could-be-a-thing/?do=findComment&comment=2239235","commentId":2239235,"userName":"Gizlivadi","timestamp":1464453745,"content":"> I'd say that neutral cards are already the multisphere cards in this games, and we need more of them, especially allies and Istaris.\n\nAnd artifacts!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221030-multi-sphere-cards-could-be-a-thing/?do=findComment&comment=2239264","commentId":2239264,"userName":"Kakita Shiro","timestamp":1464455130,"content":"Definitely Allies and Artifact Items."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221030-multi-sphere-cards-could-be-a-thing/?do=findComment&comment=2239505","commentId":2239505,"userName":"alexbobspoons","timestamp":1464474685,"content":"Multi sphere rainbow decks take thought, I hope they don't break that with multi sphere heroes"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221030-multi-sphere-cards-could-be-a-thing/?do=findComment&comment=2239564","commentId":2239564,"userName":"Vicaroth","timestamp":1464478833,"content":"> The one thing I see that prevents multi sphere cards is the design of the card.

Like a lore/spirit card might look like The top left half is green with part of the symbol while the other half is blue and the rest of the spirit icon. The way I think it could work is you either need to have a resource icon of both to play it or require at least one hero of each of the colours to pay for the cost. Of course more of a thought experiment than anything else."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/221030-multi-sphere-cards-could-be-a-thing/?do=findComment&comment=2239568","commentId":2239568,"userName":"Vicaroth","timestamp":1464479276,"content":"> Multi sphere rainbow decks take thought, I hope they don't break that with multi sphere heroes\n\nThere are a few \"multi-sphere\" heroes like Amarthiúl, Gandalf, for everything and Elrond, Hirluin the Fair for allies. \n\nI do feel that there might be more restrictive cards coming. Like what they have now, where they are more useful when you play the right spheres. But I wouldn't object to multi-sphere cards to be honest. If that is even a possibility. "}]}
