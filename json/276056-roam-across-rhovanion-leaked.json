There's only three cards currently with the woodman trait. I wonder if this pack will be filled with them like The Steward's Fear had with Outlands. I know nothing of the woodmen of middle earth so I have no idea who the hero could be. My guess is maybe another FFG created one."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276056-roam-across-rhovanion-leaked/?do=findComment&comment=3334745","commentId":3334745,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1526500439,"content":"The woodmen were just a group of Northmen living on the western edge of Mirkwood.
