So I did some quests, and learned the game, and finally completed the some quests, Hurray Hurray! So I wanted to log my games and learn about revised scoring and of course I haven't been counting turns! Darn!\n\nNow, that my scores won't be counted since they don't fit the new scoring, that's fine with me (but might not be with others), but I of course still want to log my games and write a bit about what I did right/wrong and what tactics/strategy I tried to use and what was exacting in the game. But what score do I put in the score-field?\nI tried leaving it empty, but that didn't work. O tried entering 9999 points but I guess that really screws up my stats. I tried entering 0 points but I guess that also screws with my stats (and is a real obtainable score also I think?).\n\nDo I have to resort to GUESSING my score since I don't know how many turns? Or do I have to abandon my long musings about my early adventures in the game totally? What if the scoring changes again? Am I supposed to check this site before every time I play the game since the scoring-system might have changed since last time and my score-calculations might be useless?\n\nWell. .

I have to say I am completely under-whelmed with the quest log.\n\nFirstly, in a two player game you have to enter each player's heros seperately. Which is fine but my partner does not have a FFG account (she uses me to source rules / queries etc.) I would much prefer to see all of the heros being logged in 2/3/4 player scenarios as it will make a huge difference depending on what sphere's they belong to and what their traits are as there is no way of linking accounts with the completed/failed quests in the log.\n\nSecondly, I wanted to make a play by play account of our adventure. We played The Watcher in the Water (first time for playing that quest as well). We got lucky but still won with a very repectable score of 136 for two players. However there is no where to log what was revealed from the encounter deck, who played what card, who killed what etc. I had to resort to typing all of this information into the log which added about an hour to the game time (I'm not the quickest of typists).\n\nThirdly, the summary shows the community average score for that quest. Again we had a very respectable score and we were only 2.46 points below the average. But I can't see what the best score for that quest is. In any of the player modes - solo, 2, 3 or 4 player. So I have no idea if the average is everyone all being roughly around that score of if the best 2 player score is something like 70 and the worst is something like 200 and everything in between is balancing it out.\n\nSo to summarise, I will probably use the quest log again, but without typing a small essay of how we progressed. The term 'quest log' implies it is a documentary of what we did, what we encountered and how we overcame (or failed) that particular quest. I think it is more of a online quest scoring system with a few statistics added in for good measure. I believe a lot more can be done with this which will make this a truely useful and pleasing addition to the game. However in it's current guise I am a disappointed with it, but do believe the scope is there for it to be really good.\n\nLee"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/55743-changes-to-the-quest-log/?do=findComment&comment=741573","commentId":741573,"userName":"just Logan","timestamp":1357083181,"content":"I'm thinking about attempting a statistic report page much like the one AH has here on the forums. \n\nhttps://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=paPMgoencsRppq3PEYWXmQQ&hl=en.  [https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?key=paPMgoencsRppq3PEYWXmQQ&hl=en.%C2%A0]\n\nYou can see it wil be a lot of work.
