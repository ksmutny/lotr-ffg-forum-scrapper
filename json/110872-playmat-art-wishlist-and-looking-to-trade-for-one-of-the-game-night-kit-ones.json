I think it came in the 1st or 2nd game night kit. It's the only one I'm missing (Khazad-dum/Hands Upon the Bow/Heirs of Numenor are the only 3 released so far). Post here or message me if you have one. Thanks!\n\n \n\n~\n\n \n\nAs a side discussion, anyone have any sort of wishlist of art that they hope ends up on future playmats? I think my top 5 wishlist so far would be:\n\n \n\n-Arwen Undomiel ally card - my favorite art in the game so far. Helps that Arwen is my favorite elf.\n\n \n\n-Beorn hero card - who WOULDN'T want a bear playmat!? Badass picture.\n\n \n\n-Doors of Durin location card - fantastic art of such an iconic place.\n\n \n\n-The White Council event card - The art style is kind of funky in this picture but just would be a fun playmat since it features so many top dogs. Would maybe make you feel like you were prestigious enough to be called to the White Council meeting yourself if it was on the playmat in front of you lol.\n\n \n\n-The Hobbit Over Hill and Under Hill box front - just embodies \"the journey\" and \"adventure\" to me.\n\nEdited July 14, 2014 by Mattr0polis"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110872-playmat-art-wishlist-and-looking-to-trade-for-one-of-the-game-night-kit-ones/?do=findComment&comment=1155734","commentId":1155734,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1405383148,"content":"My top 5:\n\n \n\nGondorian Fire - http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/assault-on-osgiliath/gondorian-fire-aoo [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/assault-on-osgiliath/gondorian-fire-aoo]\n\n \n\nThe North Stair - http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-hills-of-emyn-muil/the-north-stair-thoem [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/shadows-of-mirkwood/the-hills-of-emyn-muil/the-north-stair-thoem]\n\n \n\nDoors of Durin - http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/the-watcher-in-the-water/doors-of-durin-twitw [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/dwarrowdelf/the-watcher-in-the-water/doors-of-durin-twitw]\n\n \n\nDeep Knowledge - http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-voice-of-isengard/deep-knowledge-voi [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/the-voice-of-isengard/deep-knowledge-voi]\n\n \n\nIthilien Archer - http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/encounter-at-amon-din/ithilien-archer-eaad [http://www.cardgamedb.com/index.php/lotr/lord-of-the-rings-card-spoiler/_/against-the-shadow/encounter-at-amon-din/ithilien-archer-eaad]\n\n \n\n \n\nGondorian Fire and North Stair are amazing......Gondorian Fire is my favorite art.  "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110872-playmat-art-wishlist-and-looking-to-trade-for-one-of-the-game-night-kit-ones/?do=findComment&comment=1156214","commentId":1156214,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1405419485,"content":"oh - loaction art... i have redhorn gate out in play in front of me, and there's so many cool snowy, mountainous locations id want on there\n\n \n\neven snowstorm's pretty cool :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\nto be more specific, id love, firstly, the box art on a game mat, then perhaps some of the locations out of black riders"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/110872-playmat-art-wishlist-and-looking-to-trade-for-one-of-the-game-night-kit-ones/?do=findComment&comment=1156433","commentId":1156433,"userName":"Mattr0polis","timestamp":1405432967,"content":"Some good choices, Khamul.\n\n \n\nAnd yeah Rich, the Redhorn Gate mountain locations would be a sweet one!
