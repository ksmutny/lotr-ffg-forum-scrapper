Although we've already done Mirkwood that way by default. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n\n\nAnd Dain could use some time on the bench. Part of the point of this kind of format is that staple cards get excluded, forcing players to find new solutions.\n\n\n\nOf course, the main obstacle to this idea is that most games that have \"block\" formats have much deeper card pools. It isn't really possible, for example, to exclude the core set -- even if you build in a hero exception -- because the card pool would be so small.\n\n\n\nLikewise, because of the small card pool, it's probably less practical to play adventure packs as they release than it is to play a block after all 6 AP's are out and you have at least some options. From what I'm hearing, I wouldn't want to attempt the new quests in HoN with only core + HoN. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/74811-block-play/?do=findComment&comment=728364","commentId":728364,"userName":"Rapier1","timestamp":1354029679,"content":"I think that a LCG could be designed to work like this.
