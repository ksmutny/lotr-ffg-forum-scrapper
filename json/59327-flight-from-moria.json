Difficult level 7. But almost every time i play i win. And i win quite easy. Quest almost didn have cards with surge effect so nothing really dangerous there. Ok trolls id really powerful but most of the time i can win the game before my threat reach 38. Cose i always manage to get tools and brake the wall in 4 rounds. Maybe with more players is more difficult??? Some one play it in co-op???\n\nAnd after couple of session i realize this quest actually is quite boring and annoying for solo. Any ideas from you fellows????"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59327-flight-from-moria/?do=findComment&comment=583481","commentId":583481,"userName":"Ninjawa2","timestamp":1327304078,"content":"I also found this a strange one that could be really easy or really drawn out depending on the quest card flip.  I've only tried it twice with a bilbo/birur/dwalin deck and got killed the first time by revelaing a treachery on 'blocked by shadow' and completed it the next time by getting the tools and breaking out in two turns thanks to some unexpected courage and the sacrifice of a west road traveller.  Am I right in thinking that it is possible to complete this quest in a single turn?

If i Have tools on my hero and use it in refresh phase to put progress token on the quest card but there is a active location?\n\nI should put token on active  location or on the quest card???

When you're revealing 4 encounter cards a turn it gets much much more difficult. And the 2b quest card to draw a treachery on the 4 player games has so far removed 75% of the players over 4 attempts at the quest. On one occasion taking out all of them in one go on the very first draw. One player is much much easier. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59327-flight-from-moria/?do=findComment&comment=586617","commentId":586617,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1327836185,"content":"OK i have chance to try it today with my friend. Yes is much more harder and interesting for 2 players.

The only progress you can put on the 'tools' quest card ( I forget the name) is exhausting the character with the tools, but that's limit once per turn.

I use Bilbo with Fast hitch attached so is not a big problem.\n\nBut you know what is really nasty??? When you already put 3 tokens by Tools and then come Treachery :New Devilery. Then you shuffle quest card back to quest deck and lose all tokens as well! Really bad!I get it twice in 1 game! \n\nI play 2 session 2 player. Results: 1 win 1 lose. Not bad.

The trick is not to kill any of the Trolls and keep your threat low (they Trolls increase the threat/damage of the Balrog when killed) and to cycle fast and find the Escape from Darkness quest card and stick to it, waiting for the Abandoned Tools to show up manually. We saved our counter cards for New Dewilry. Of course you need to be lucky that the tools are not get discarded as shadow cards. I don't say FfM is easy but it's not terrible difficult either if you know the quest.\n\nMaybe they should have added to Escape from Darkness quest card: \"Forced: If you don't have put at least one progress token on this quest card this turn you have to bypass it\" in order to make it impossible to sit out on it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59327-flight-from-moria/?do=findComment&comment=587609","commentId":587609,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1327991446,"content":"This is the first quest that does get more difficult the longer you play as you can't help BUT add victory points so the nameless fear just sits therre getting more powerful but 4 player is where this quest really is MUCH more difficult. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59327-flight-from-moria/?do=findComment&comment=587888","commentId":587888,"userName":"SiCK_Boy","timestamp":1328029589,"content":"Yep.
