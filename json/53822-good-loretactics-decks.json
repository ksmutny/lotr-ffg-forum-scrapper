I've tweaked my Leadership/Spirit deck based on an idea listed there, but I am now trying out the infamous Journey Along the Anduin and have gotten bootstomped by a certain Hill Troll in back to back games (thought I had a shot in the second game, but a surging Wolf Rider revealed a second HT and I just scooped).\n\nI plan on getting more cards (likely the adventure packs and the big-box expansion, not a second core set) so I know the pool will grow, and along with that, my options. In the meantime, does anyone have a suggestion for a decent Lore/Tactics deck that I could run?\n\nAnd on a side note, a question about Steward of Gondor: Once attached, can I conceivably use it twice in a turn? If I use it at the end of the combat phase, can I use it again after I refresh during the action window at the end of the refresh phase? Dumping four resources onto an Aragorn that has Celebrian's Stone on him seems pretty naughty.\n\nThanks for the help!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53822-good-loretactics-decks/?do=findComment&comment=533910","commentId":533910,"userName":"Dam the Man","timestamp":1317170035,"content":"Creature on the Loose said:\n\nAnd on a side note, a question about Steward of Gondor: Once attached, can I conceivably use it twice in a turn?

It's really not any different than just exhausting it at the beginning of the next turn."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53822-good-loretactics-decks/?do=findComment&comment=533927","commentId":533927,"userName":"Narsil0420","timestamp":1317173373,"content":"I use Glorfindel, Beravor, Legolas as my heros in a deck designed to be a \"One Deck to Rule them All\" to be able to beat the first three expansion scenarios. So far it's doing an ok job. I worked Carrock the other day with this. I use one core set with three expansions. In the tactics cards I focus mostly on the eagles with Radagast in there. I also include Song of Kings and a handful of the important Leadership attachments.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n "}]}
