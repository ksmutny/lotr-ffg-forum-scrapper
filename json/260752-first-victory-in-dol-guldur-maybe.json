I love this game and I'm happy to be with you in this community. I'm just on the Core Set right now, with only the core-cards. After been defeated around twenty times, i win Escape from Dol Guldur quest, maybe...\n\nI would check if I played in the right way and need some rule's clarifications please.\n\nRound 12, in the quest phase i draw \"Iron Shackles \" and in the next phase I travel to \"Mountains of Mirkwood\"; Dol Guldur Orcs come as travel effect. After engage I deal the shadow card to the enemy, then before orcs attack i use \"Quick Strike\" to kill them with Legolas (with double blade of Gondolin) exploring the mountains. Iron shackles prevents to draw, but...:\n\n1. Can i look trought the top 5 cards of my deck and choose one?                                                  If so, have I to reshuffle the player's deck, put Iron shackles on top and discard it when the next 'draw a card' will come?\n\n2. Can I use quick strike after dealing shadow cards before a enemy attack?                                 If so, can i use it , for example, before sub phase  -Resolve shadow effect- , to avoid the eventual shadow and the damage , if the enemy is killed?\n\nAll for now , next questions will follow, thanks in advance and sorry if my english is bad."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/260752-first-victory-in-dol-guldur-maybe/?do=findComment&comment=3024404","commentId":3024404,"userName":"JYoder","timestamp":1507911883,"content":" \n\n1) Iron Shackles is an attachment that triggers when you draw, which you're not, so your resolution sounds correct -- put Iron Shackles back on top after you look at the top cards.\n\n2) Absolutely. You choose when to play Quick Strike -- can be during encounter phase, before enemy has a shadow card, or during combat, when it does have one. Either way, with the enemy destroyed, there is no attack to resolve. Same idea with Spear of the Citadel on an enemy with 1 life remaining -- the enemy is killed before it can attack.\n\n \n\nEdited October 13, 2017 by JYoder"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/260752-first-victory-in-dol-guldur-maybe/?do=findComment&comment=3024411","commentId":3024411,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1507912011,"content":"It seem that you play all of it very well.

Because on stage 2 were all the tokens needed I go on stage 3 , putting the  tokens, gained in the quest phase, on the new stage. I waited the round after , the last one, to buy an axe and discard the map from Legolas; the two objectives of Gimli gone with him( he die on round15  during combat phase,sigh again!) :\n\n5. Can I end stage 3 , escaping from Dol Guldur without objectives ? \n\n6. Could I buy the axe just after getting the map?

But unfortunately I have an extra round at the end due to the impossibility to attack with Legolas plus blade  killing-progress abilities ( king spider revelated and, if not enough, another king spider as shadow, just 3 Heroes , no allies, no resource to ready Aragorn after quest committing, no way to have Legolas ready, 'Unexpected Courage' still in the deck...), and no chance to get 7 tokens from questing without Faramir; so due to the fact that the spiders will come ( never seen them during the game, and that were just 2 cards left in the encounter deck before questing), I give the map to Legolas, discarding it with a dwarf axe in the round's after planning phase. \n\nMy doubt about the question I asked on point 6 , I'll try to explain with one example, is this:\n\nYou get Steward of Gondor spending   2 lidership resources in the planning phase , then, exhausting the card, you get 2 resorces for the Hero with the attachment. This is an action, like the one i did in Dol Guldur after buying 'Celebrian's Stone' with Aragorn reducing the threat with Galadhrim card . I don't know if after one of these actions the planning phase is finish, and if i can use the steward's fresh resources to buy other allies and attachments, or buy an axe for Legolas right after getting the map in my game, in the same planning phase.\n\nNew 6. Does any action interrupt the planning phase ?\n\nThank you for the previous answers\nJYoder, The Haunt for Gollum wow!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/260752-first-victory-in-dol-guldur-maybe/?do=findComment&comment=3025648","commentId":3025648,"userName":"NathanH","timestamp":1507968430,"content":"You can take actions throughout the planning phase without affecting your ability to play more allies and attachments."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/260752-first-victory-in-dol-guldur-maybe/?do=findComment&comment=3025694","commentId":3025694,"userName":"Moradir","timestamp":1507976228,"content":"> 2 hours ago, NathanH said:\n> \n> You can take actions throughout the planning phase without affecting your ability to play more allies and attachments.\n\nThank you NathanH.
