They can be whatever level of specific or vague you like. You can restrict the card pool I use (progression-style, minimum purchase, random or specific selection of packs, whatever), stipulate using specific cards or combos, target a specific quest or just ask for a working deck that fits the other conditions. Just try to make them interesting.\n\n \n\nObviously depending on how many suggestions I get I may or may not be able to do all challenges people give me, but for each challenge I do I will put a post on the blog talking through my deckbuilding process and then have either a written play-session report or a video of me attempting a quest with the deck. If I'm doing a video for a given challenge I might actually just stream it, though finding time to stream may be difficult for me over the next month.\n\nOh, and of course I'll post in this thread to let everyone know when I've done a challenge.\n\n \n\nSo if you can think of any deckbuilding challenges you'd find it interesting to see someone attempt, please post in this thread and I'll see if I can get it done!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240464-warden-of-arnor-give-me-deckbuilding-challenges/?do=findComment&comment=2602166","commentId":2602166,"userName":"Network57","timestamp":1485036407,"content":"RNG all 3 heroes and a quest.

When you build your deck, at least a third of the cards in the deck (17 in a 50 card deck) must have a RingsDB popularity of 1: http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Sort=Sphere_Type_Cost&Popularity=1&PopularityOp=eq [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Sort=Sphere_Type_Cost&Popularity=1&PopularityOp=eq]\n\n \n\nIt won't be an especially strong deck (though there are some decent dwarf cards in that list), but I imagine that this will present some tough deckbuilding choices and result in an interesting, unique deck.\n\n \n\nEdit: Alternatively, you could have half your deck consist of cards with a popularity of 2 or less: http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Sort=Sphere_Type_Cost&Popularity=2&PopularityOp=lteq [http://hallofbeorn.com/LotR?Sort=Sphere_Type_Cost&Popularity=2&PopularityOp=lteq]\n\nEdited January 22, 2017 by Estel Edain"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240464-warden-of-arnor-give-me-deckbuilding-challenges/?do=findComment&comment=2602388","commentId":2602388,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1485053255,"content":"What fun!

Worked out great, as I was confident it would, though I did talk through how things could potentially have gone wrong for me. Trying it against the Nightmare version of the quest, on the other hand, was very much a failure. Interesting for me especially since that's the first time I've played Nightmare Mount Gram, and I guess it makes sense that the Nightmare version is more likely to screw you if you try and circumvent the intended mechanics. Though I wonder if we'll reach a point somewhere down the line where it will be feasible once the card pool expands a bit further.\n\nThe stream VOD appears to have split itself in two for some reason, but it is right now being exported to youtube.\n\nEdited May 21, 2017 by PocketWraith"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240464-warden-of-arnor-give-me-deckbuilding-challenges/?do=findComment&comment=2800538","commentId":2800538,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1495487815,"content":"VOD:\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240464-warden-of-arnor-give-me-deckbuilding-challenges/?do=findComment&comment=2820985","commentId":2820985,"userName":"PocketWraith","timestamp":1496588916,"content":"Not doing a deckbuilding challenge, but will still be streaming in 4 hours.

It seems to me that Glorfindel and Arwen both contribute critical missing elements to a Gandalf + Elrond build that Treebeard just doesn't provide. While I doubt this is by any means an impossible task, I think this 40-starting-threat build has still got some interesting challenging elements to it, and I'd be interested in seeing how people creatively get around those problems."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/240464-warden-of-arnor-give-me-deckbuilding-challenges/?do=findComment&comment=2851049","commentId":2851049,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1498254471,"content":"Since Gandalf have all sphere it is pretty easy to play a lot of cards with imladris stargazer and wizard pipe.
