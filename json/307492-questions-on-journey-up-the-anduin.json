As far as I remember that quest was quite hyped as it was new.\n\n(Besides using old sets, that quest seems not to be that special, right? (do I miss something here? o.O) )\n\nAnyhow, I do have question on the mechanics of that quest. If I set up correctly, Goblin Snipers (cannot be engaged, if other enemies are in the staging area) are in the Evil Creatures deck. Also, the encounter deck contains Stray Goblin (cannot optionally be engaged). Both do have a very high threat.\n\nSo, if I have a Stray Goblin in the staging area, explore Woodmen Village and reveal a Goblin Sniper (to attach Haldan to). Then the quest somewhat get locked down. Bugged? Or did I miss something here?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/307492-questions-on-journey-up-the-anduin/?do=findComment&comment=3924431","commentId":3924431,"userName":"Alonewolf87","timestamp":1586163446,"content":"> 38 minutes ago, Flrbb said:\n> \n> So, if I have a Stray Goblin in the staging area, explore Woodmen Village and reveal a Goblin Sniper (to attach Haldan to).
