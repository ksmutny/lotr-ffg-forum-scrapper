It is great for the game, and it is exciting to see the community around the game grow and mature. This also comes with a cost. Specifically, it costs money to host the search engine. I have started a Patreon account to help cover the hosting costs of the site. If you find the search engine useful, all that I ask is for $1 a month. This helps me to keep content up to date and continue adding new features.

While it is hard to correlate an increase in traffic on the search engine with a direct increase in players of the game, this is certainly the most logical conclusion. I can say that traffic on the search engine seems to be up 10-25% since just before Gen Con and almost 30% since the beginning of the year."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/187290-hall-of-beorn-card-search-now-has-a-patreon-account/?do=findComment&comment=1777706","commentId":1777706,"userName":"Raven1015","timestamp":1441518577,"content":"> Where is that \"dead game\" crowd you keep talking about?
