I search the forums before asking a question, so here will be those I couldn't find the answer:\n\n1- Aragorn/Theodred quest commitment?? Do the commit together and can I use the response in any order, or once a card commited, I must use that card's response before commiting the other one? If I commit Aragorn first without resource token, I cannot ready him. If I then commit Theodred and give Aragorn a resource token, can I ready him???\n\n2- Son of Arbor: When he attacks according to his response, does he exhauts?\n\n3- Sneak attack: answered :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n4- Quick Strike: Can I use it in any phase?\n\n5- Stand together: When defending using this card, if the defence total is greater than attack total, no Damage? If attack is greater, how do I apply damage?\n\n6- The Brown Lands: answered\n\n7- Out of the Dungeons: If the objectives gets detached, nothing happens?\n\n \n\nThanks for the answers of this part 1 of my questions…\n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83049-goldenrods-newbie-questions/?do=findComment&comment=789774","commentId":789774,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1367158670,"content":"hello\n\n1.all characters all player controls are commited together so you cannot say, have aragorn and theodred controlled by the same player, and commit theodred to give aragorn a resource, nor can you wait for theodred to give him a resource and then ready him.\n\nwhat you could do is if the first player controls aragorn and the second theodred, is commit aragorn and then when the 2nd player is commiting, commit theodred and give a resource to aragorn, but it would be too late to ready him\n\nbascially he needs the resource  before commiting as its a response\n\n2.yes. son of arnors ability is only to engage an enemy when he enters play. attacks are a different phase\n\n3.\n\n4.yes, as long as it is in a 'green' action window as per the timesheet in the back of the rule book, (and also before and after each phase as per the FAQ) and also as long as the enemy is elegible to be attacked, ie. engaged with you, or you have a ranged character.\n\n5.as per the FAQ damage must be assigned to one character taking part in the defense….you cant spread it out. if defense is higher no damage as usual\n\n6.\n\n7.im not sure i understand this question, are you reffering to the shadow key, map and so on from the escape from dol guldur quest?\n\nhope these help\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/83049-goldenrods-newbie-questions/?do=findComment&comment=789814","commentId":789814,"userName":"Goldenrod","timestamp":1367172355,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nhello\n\n1.all characters all player controls are commited together so you cannot say, have aragorn and theodred controlled by the same player, and commit theodred to give aragorn a resource, nor can you wait for theodred to give him a resource and then ready him.\n\nwhat you could do is if the first player controls aragorn and the second theodred, is commit aragorn and then when the 2nd player is commiting, commit theodred and give a resource to aragorn, but it would be too late to ready him\n\nbascially he needs the resource  before commiting as its a response\n\n \n\nI had post a reply before yours but it didn't appeared.
