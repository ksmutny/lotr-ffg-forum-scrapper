Fortune or Fate says return to play under \"owner's control,\" and nothing about a \"controller.\"  I think that a player eliminated from the game couldn't \"control\" anything, but they can still \"own\" cards.\n\n3) Yes\n\n4) Yes, via Will of the West\n\nEdit: I can't think of the thread offhand, but there were some really interesting, similar posts about a player in scenario 3 having all of their heroes minus the prisoner killed... what happens to engaged creatures when a player is eliminated, etc."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50669-resurrecting-a-defeated-player-andor-using-his-discarded-cards/?do=findComment&comment=506214","commentId":506214,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1311985613,"content":"DISCLAIMER: All of this is based off of common sense, as obviously there is not an official ruling.\n\nI think it would depend on why the player was removed from the game. If it was because all of his heroes died, then I would say that this is all legit. If it was because he reached 50 threat, then I think as soon as you brought one of his heroes back, he would immediately be eliminated again."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50669-resurrecting-a-defeated-player-andor-using-his-discarded-cards/?do=findComment&comment=506215","commentId":506215,"userName":"conykchameleon","timestamp":1311985847,"content":"Sorry for the double post, I don't know how to edit these things. After re-reading the section on player elimination, I would say that none of this would be legal. I think the cited clause about \"cards being returned to their owner's discard piles\" is there to deal with attachments and things from other players placed on cards controlled by the eliminated player. When it says a player is eliminated, it seems pretty clear that their cards are no longer part of the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/50669-resurrecting-a-defeated-player-andor-using-his-discarded-cards/?do=findComment&comment=506248","commentId":506248,"userName":"pumpkin","timestamp":1311993567,"content":"I'm not sure I agree - all it states is that all cards are returned to owner's discard piles and engaged enemies return to staging.
