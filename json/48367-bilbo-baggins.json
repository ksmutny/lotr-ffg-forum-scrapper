I really wonder why the formula has been modified for him, if not for Frodo in the next expansion. I'd understand if there was a super-powerful Hobbit-trait-oriented card coming up but since Frodo seems ok, there probably isn't.\n\nI know he's supposed to be slightly older in these years but yet, I have always find him much more heroic than his nephew/cousin, thus especially the Willpower of 1 seems especially wrong. The ability is good but surelly not worth the +3 threat modification, is it?\n\nAs one of my all-time favourite character, I'd really like to have him in a deck but considering replacing Beravor with him seems a total folly from the Boromir-type-of-player point of view."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48367-bilbo-baggins/?do=findComment&comment=485013","commentId":485013,"userName":"Kzer-za","timestamp":1308035517,"content":"Probably because people have already discussed him and most agree he doesn't look very good.

You essentially get to go through your deck twice as fast for free. That is a massive advantage in this kind of game. How often have you sat there hoping that gandalf would come out of thec deck to save you?

Now Bilbo doesn't have to exhaust to get one card, but what exactly is he going to do? He only has 1 willpower, and questing with 2 HP is risky if The Necromancer's Reach is in the deck. He can only attack for 1 damage. 2 defense is okay, but with 2 HP one bad shadow effect could kill him. And if Evil Storm is in the deck he becomes even more fragile."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48367-bilbo-baggins/?do=findComment&comment=485056","commentId":485056,"userName":"lleimmoen","timestamp":1308042670,"content":"I know there's been discussion elsewhere, I just felt like bringing it up again since it has been official.\n\nYeah. I'm still hoping I'm just underestimating him. But all the logic seems to say otherwise. Of course, the ability is great but really, what are you gonna do with the stats? If there is an enemy with an Attack of 2 or less, you can hope to defend it. Or you can quest for 1 every turn and use Glorfindel if needed, in a majority of time that should be enough to keep him alive.\n\nThere are other two heroes that usually just quest with a Willpower of 1, Theodred and Thalin. I haven't used Thalin much because I don't play Tactics-major and Legolas always seems much better choice. Theodred on the other hand is very useful if just for questing slow and dealing extra resrource.\n\nThe worst seems the comparison with Beravor. Of course you can just replace Glorfindel or Denethor in all Lore deck but Beravor usually seems a good relations as she also gives you extra cards. You basically need to use (exhaust) Beravor once in every other turn to get the same number of cards as Bilbo gets. In the other turn she can quest for 2 (as if Bilbo quested twice) or defend one stronger enemy... It seems at best even now but there is the big difference: with Unexpected Courage, it gets all skewed and Bilbo just seems useless in comparison because there is probably no card to make Bilbo much more useful than he is, is there? Citadel Plate? Foolish. Favour of the Lady or Celebrian's Stone? Yeah, there are always better candidates. What else? Maybe other expansions will take care of this? Or maybe I (and others as I see) will have to deal with it."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48367-bilbo-baggins/?do=findComment&comment=485129","commentId":485129,"userName":"Mestrahd","timestamp":1308053494,"content":"I agree that his ability is stellar in solo play, but it greatly diminishes with even a second player.

The card is still there and with more heroes the team can probably find a minor role for him better than in solo where he can be a total weak point.\n\nOtherwise, you summed up what I think. There's been talk of house rule him for the cost of 6 and I'd kinda support that. I'd like to hear the designer(s) thought about his stats...\n\nI've printed him out and just tried him in a coop Anduin. We've won easily. The player who used him had a starting threat cost of 30 (with Glorfindel and Legolas) thus we had to deal with the troll round 1. If Bilbo was 6, the total would have been 27 and the beginning a much easier story.\n\nPS: Howbout a petition to reprint him stronger in the next expansion, I'd be all for that... or perhaps they'll do his own attachment (like Mithril Coat) that would really boost him up, that'd be very sweet. I hope the people responsible will read this thread and act accordingly. Haha.

Wrote something of the kind before. It should/could be restricted for Hobbits or even for Bilbo. For two reasons, Frodo's stats are just alright, second, it was Bilbo's at the time. Maybe it could have an action that would move it to Frodo for a cost of 1. Would that not be sweet? I have to say it would even though it is my idea.\n\nWhether it should increase hit points or defense I am not sure. Citadel Plate does hit points. Continuity? As for the numbers, the increase of 2 should be enough, the cost should definitelly be 1.\n\nAnd there should be two effects, surely. Either the boost and moveability or the boost plus something else, like Blade of Gondolin has, just different, of course."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/48367-bilbo-baggins/?do=findComment&comment=485568","commentId":485568,"userName":"Spirit Juggler","timestamp":1308120998,"content":"I used Bilbo in a tactics major deck and I have to say he worked extremely well.
