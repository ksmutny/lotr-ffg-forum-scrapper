Of course partly it's contextual - if you don't have so many good defenders available but attack is fine, then sure, a potential defence boost is going to be more useful than spreading direct damage around. But if you can defend adequately, then I come back to the \"a lot of the time it's a matter of Dori otherwise doing nothing.\" I think we can be pretty sure that if you still had Thalin, he would be consistently doing something.\n\n \n\nI would certainly agree that Dori is not as bad as some people have said he is. But would it really be game-breaking if his ability either a) could be applied as a response after a shadow was revealed, b) could be applied to allies as well as heroes, or c) applied the bonus until the end of the phase instead of just for one attack? Maybe all three of those at once would be a bit much, but one or two of them I think would still be fine, and make him much more usable.\n\nEdited January 17, 2016 by PocketWraith"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199340-so-dori-hes-not-terrible/?do=findComment&comment=1995938","commentId":1995938,"userName":"blinky","timestamp":1453030775,"content":"> ...

It's not a matter of perspective, she clearly brings something to the table which really helps, so long as you make the deck work around her.

Dori isn’t unplayable. He isn’t terrible. He isn’t even bad. I mean—really check him out. He’s a 10-threat Hero sitting at 2/3/2/5 with Sentinel (assuming someone’s running Dain—which you are if you’re trying to find reasons to run Dori). Those are good stats. And that’s before you take into account the fact that he’s a target for the various Dwarf events and attachments. And he’s a Tactics dwarf, which you can’t ignore considering your other options are pretty limited (I love Gimli but Thalin is a Hero you have to build around to make him effective). Plus, even forgetting about his ability, he has Sentinel, which is okay in 2-player, good in 3-player and fantastic in 4-player. And while this is an admittedly small thing—that art.\n\n \n\nHe’s not bad.\n\n \n\nBut…that ability. That ability is bad. For a number of reasons. Exhaust a 10-threat cost hero (with a base 1/2/2 but really 2/3/2 stat line) to add 2 (maybe 3, if you got a Ring Mail on him) to another defending characters defense. For that one attack. And only if the defending character was a hero. And before shadow effects are revealed. And—this is the kicker—on a hero that already has Sentinel and could have just blocked on the other side of the board.\n\n \n\nSo no, Dori isn’t a bad character. Not even really a bad Hero. But unless you’re in a 4-player game playing against a combat-heavy encounter deck and need a Tactics resource on a Dwarf-traited character in your hero-lineup (something that, post Erebor Battle Master’s errata, is less important) then the opportunity cost for playing him vs so many other heroes is just too much. And even if you play him…how often are you going to want to use his ability vs just using the Sentinel?\n\n \n\nThat’s why Dori’s a disappointment. Not because he’s terrible. But because, unlike other mediocre-on-the-surface heroes like Rossiel and Caldara, there’s no way to build around his ability to make it more than it appears. At least, not one anyone has figured out yet with the current cardpool.\n\n \n\nFor me, he reminds me of Mirlonde. She’s fine. Her stats are decent and she can key off some Silvan synergy. But the designers were so focuses on not making her over-powered (and pushing mono-sphere decks to the exclusion of everything else) that they made her lack-luster. But at least Mirlonde is dirt-cheap in the right deck—Dori is still 10 threat. \n\n \n\nEDIT:\n\n \n\nOne thing worth noting that I forgot to mention. In a muti-player game where you have Dain on the board, you are going to want to have as many dwarves as possible across the players. Someone running this Dori means your Lore player can't run the (really pretty good) Dori ally. \n\nEdited January 20, 2016 by JonofPDX"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199340-so-dori-hes-not-terrible/?do=findComment&comment=2003503","commentId":2003503,"userName":"soullos","timestamp":1453339434,"content":"He's disappointing, that's for sure.

attachment is in-sphere.  It's also extremely useful for other heroes with an exhaust ability (Beravor, Denethor, Elanor, Haldir, Galadriel, Merry), but most of the other heroes have once per round limitations and only Dori has the attachment in-sphere.  The attachment would also be handy for attachments that exhaust themselves and the hero, but again that's not repeatable and only in-sphere for

attack.\n\n \n\nWith that, Dori's loss of action advantage can be worth it, because by buffing the defense of a good *attacking* hero he can potentially enable substantial direct damage.  Suddenly Dori becomes useful in a Gimli deck, serving as a defender most of the time but enabling the occasional massive counter stroke.  But it's also a card that doesn't require Dori to be in play to be

If it weren't for Beregond, Dori would be the cheapest way to get sentinel in tactics (your only other choice being Théoden). He's also a way to easily get to 4-6 defense without requiring too many attachments -- a great option for quests where the players have to weather many attacks of 5-8 (so the HoN+AtS cycle, or any quest with a troll or dragon in it).\n\nThe problem is that Beregond solves these problems more efficiently: with a single (free) attachment he defends for 6 on turn 1. Anywhere you might consider using Dori, Beregond is going to do the job better. The only thing Dori has on Beregond is that Dori is a dwarf, but once \"tactics dwarf\" is your criterion then the more generally applicable Gimli starts to look more attractive...\n\nHe came too late to be useful without a support card. He probably would have seen some play back in the Khazad Dum days, but in the modern card pool he's just a little too niche.\n\nFor what it's worth, my friends and I used Dori in a 3-player romp taking dwarf decks through Ruins of Belegost, and he was pretty useful. With just a single Ring Mail attached, he could combine forces with Bombur, Dain, or Gandalf to safely tank hits from the dragon without losing a hero.

The phrasing \"takes no damage while defending that attack\" is a little unclear though. \n\n \n\nAs for the readying effect I can see what you mean, but in practice I think I would still prefer neutral for its overall utility. Either way it would be a welcome addition to the cardpool. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/199340-so-dori-hes-not-terrible/?do=findComment&comment=2006424","commentId":2006424,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1453464248,"content":"Pretty clear to me.
