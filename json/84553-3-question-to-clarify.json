So , am i  forced to fight the enemy which i wanted to avoid  it or the engagement check is pass to the next player?\n\n2) When an enemy is undefeated , after the combat phrase , do we discard the shadow card or it stay with the undefeated enemy?\n\n3) i am blocking an enemy attack , the creature reveal its shadow card, there is a shadow effect , So , can the other player use its event card such as hasty stroke to remove the shadow effect on that shadow card when i am currently trying to block the enemy attack??\n\nThanks for the answer!!!! :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"}]}
