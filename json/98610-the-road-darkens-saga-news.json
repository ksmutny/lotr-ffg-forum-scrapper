I love the allies spoiled on the About page. Elrond is another Condition attachment remover! He's like Gandalf for Lore because he has great stats, leaves after one round, and gives you three great options for what he can do. Other than each player drawing 1 card, though, his options are a bit more conditional, but they are still things that can be greatly appreciated. Healing 7 damage off of Beregond with Citadel Plate is always nice, though unlikely. Elrond is also nice, compared to Gandalf, because all of his options can potentially help teammates rather then just the player playing the card (Gandalf can deal 4 damage, which could help anyone too, but this is probably his least-used ability).\n\n \n\nThe Bilbo ally is also pretty nice because getting the Hobbit Pipes out before Smoke Rings can be a challenge."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98610-the-road-darkens-saga-news/?do=findComment&comment=975860","commentId":975860,"userName":"Dwarf king Bronze beard","timestamp":1391707281,"content":"Looks awesome i really want to get that, but i have few questions: What are these saga expansions difference from those adventure packs and deluxe expansions and another question is: can i use those powerful attachments like Glamdring in another guests or only for this one. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98610-the-road-darkens-saga-news/?do=findComment&comment=975913","commentId":975913,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1391709707,"content":"OH!

Think about it... this is the part of the series where Gandalf is the most critical: getting the fellowship through Moria and holding off the Balrog. There's nothing more heroic than that. I wouldn't be surprised if there's something built into the quest that allows you to discard Gandalf to defeat the Balrog, to add some thematic play value.\n\n \n\nWith regards to the allies, I think it'll be Gimli and Legolas. We'll get new hero versions of them in the next box when they head off to Rohan so now is the time to get them as allies.\n\n \n\nThe art on Elrond is horrible, he looks like he should be holding a guitar singing folk songs instead of being leader of the elves.\n\n \n\nBilbo is great flavor. He quests and fetches pipes, but if you plan to use him in a fight you're basically throwing him under the bus. I like that they didn't try to turn him into a combat powerhouse.\n\n \n\nThe thing I'm most interested in are the encounter cards. I'm really curious how they plan to do Moria (again) in one single scenario including the balrog fight.

Sure, the 3 so far have had 4 heroes - and I can see how that would set expectations - but I don't think FFG took the decision to only have 1 hero in this box lightly. In fact, I'm sure they anticipated this reaction. Therefore, I think we can expect something special.\n\n \n\nMaybe I have my \"formal logic hat\" on in that past performance should never (logically) indicate present or future performance - so it's bad for all of us to assume FFG will always do things with this card game as they always have.\n\n \n\nThere are so many examples of people making assumptions (we'll never have a wizard hero, we'll never have a non-humanoid hero like gwaihir or an ent, we'll never have an ally not be the same sphere as the hero version, etc) and some of these have come not to hold, and who yet knows about the others?\n\n \n\nwho knows what the other sagas will do. whether they return to 4 heroes, or 3 or 2 or 1, or none!\n\n \n\nfrom my perspective, there are tons of heroes already to make interesting decks, and only getting one hero isn't a let down. especially since i am assuming (and i shouldn't!) that FFG will surprise us with a great one - since it is only one!\n\nEdited February 13, 2014 by Dain Ironfoot"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98610-the-road-darkens-saga-news/?do=findComment&comment=984314","commentId":984314,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1392323109,"content":"True enough Dain, there are no set rules on this.\n\nJust assumed it was 4 for the saga boxes like the 1 for APs & 2 for the deluxe ones.\n\nDo hope your assumption is correct on it being a special hero though!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98610-the-road-darkens-saga-news/?do=findComment&comment=984342","commentId":984342,"userName":"HeavyKaragh","timestamp":1392324410,"content":">  \n> \n> i am assuming (and i shouldn't!) that FFG will surprise with with a great one - since it is only one!\n> \n> \n> \n>  \n\n \n\nGandalf would be a great bait!\n\n \n\nWe received the one-use ally version on the Core Set.

This version of Gandalf is based on the idea that he goes where he is needed and that he can really be utilized by any player at the table.\n\n \n\nI don't see Gandalf as a constant man of action. There are times when he just wants to read books and experience the world instead of going on Perilous quests all the time. So while he is not off saving the world, he is in a more relaxed state thus he needs stats that reflect his outlook on life.   \n\n \n\nIn a solo game, you could use this ability at most 3 times without using any kind of Sneak Attack cards, however in a multiplayer this Gandalf will really shine because you could trigger his ability several times with multiple players playing his ally form.\n\n \n\nAs for the negatives, his ability is dependent on another Gandalf being put into play and the fact that he has a harder time saving resources because he is getting bounced in and out of play due to his ability. Resources are not saved like his attachments.   \n\n \n\nThe treachery reduction is to reflect that he has gone out to do something meaningful to aid the people of Middle Earth. Giving them a better chance of a safer adventure.\n\nEdited February 16, 2014 by Sprenger"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/98610-the-road-darkens-saga-news/?do=findComment&comment=986458","commentId":986458,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1392544244,"content":"Very good idea.
