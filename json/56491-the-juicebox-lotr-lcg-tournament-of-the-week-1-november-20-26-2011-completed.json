The idea behind this is that for one week (Sunday – Saturday), everyone is invited to participate in playing a particular quest with particular deck building requirements and a particular number of players. You are then invited to record and post your final score, the heroes you used, and any additional narrative that you’d like to add.\n\nNote: this is not a place to post results from the past. The tournament has a one-week lifespan, and only games played and recorded throughout this week are valid. As the week unfolds, I will keep this first post updated with the Top Ten results. (Each participant can occupy a maximum of one Top Ten spot at a time, so you’re welcome to try and best your own result throughout the week).\n\nWill you place in the Top Ten for the week? I hope you’ll participate and find out!\n\nAfter the end of this week’s tournament, you are welcome to continue to post results to this thread if you continue to play this particular quest under these particular parameters. However, the Top Ten on this first post will not continue to be updated after the week is over, thus preserving (like a time capsule) the results from this week’s tournament. Further, please refrain from using this thread for extensive theorizing and/or conversation that is not directly related to this particular tournament. Nothing against other conversations – it’s just, that’s what other threads are for. Specifically, if you have ideas for a future tournament of the week, feel free to suggest them in the Ideas Thread [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=579104].\n\nAnd now… on to this week’s Tournament of the Week!\n\nTournament of the Week #1:\n\nQuest: Journey Down the Anduin\nDeck Parameters: 1 Core Set Only – No Adventure Packs\nNumber of Players: Solo Play – 1 Player/1 Deck\n\nThis week’s tournament is inspired by Marlow’s recent desire [http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_foros_discusion.asp?efid=201&efcid=4&efidt=577637] to absolutely conquer the Anduin. While playing Solo, using only one deck made from one core set, may not be everyone’s cup of tea, defined parameters are what will make each Tournament of the Week a unique and specific challenge. I hope you enjoy it!\n\nTop Ten:\n\n1. wraith428 ~ 84 (Glóin, Beravor, Éowyn)\n2. plueschi ~ 93 (Glorfindel, Beravor, Glóin)\n3. leptokurt ~ 95 (Eleanor, Glóin, Beravor)\n4. Chac ~ 97 (Éowyn, Beravor, Théodred)\n5. OnkelZorni ~ 98 (Beravor, Glóin, Éowyn)\n5. Bungo_Underhill ~ 98 (Éowyn, Théodred, Beravor)\n7. Avalanche ~ 109 (Aragorn, Beravor, Denethor)\n7.

I got Necromancer's Pass and Treacherous Fog. I didn't dare to travel to the pass, since I feared to loose Gandalf. In round 4 I engaged the Hill Troll. I sneaked Gandalf in, hurt the troll with four dmage, chose Gandalf as Defender, readied him via Ever Vigilant and then he killed the monster together with Thalin, the Spearman and a Citadel Guard. Yeah Gondor!\n\nI finally visited the Pass during stage 2. The encounters weren't too bad: Necromancer's Reach, Banks of Anduin 2x and Brown Lands. The latter one stalled my questing progress a lot, but OTOH I could defat the Beastmaster while no new enemy appeared (except of those Eastern crows who tried to pick my heroes from time to time, befor the were picked by Thalin's Axe).

I got this game when it first came out, and had played a handful of times. Enough to see it was fun, but a lot of two handed solo because I felt solo was a bit hard. Friends too far away and all that. So I hadn't had much experience deckbuilding, and then playing those decks, so this was well worth my time.\n\nMy eventual winning deck was Beravor, Theodred, Eowyn. Final score was:\n\nRefresh counter at 10 =100 points\n\nWound total at 3 = 3 points\n\nFinal threat at 24 = 24 points\n\nVictory points = 7\n\nTotal = 120\n\nFor those interested,I started with Aragorn, Theodred, and Eleanor, thinking the threat starting cost and the sphere synergies with Celebrian's stone made for a good deck. Not to mention Aragorn can defend against one hit from the big bad troll. After three failures (one pretty close one) all on the second stage I realized that I was letting most treacheries go through because either my threat level made them ineffective, or it seemed more appealing to not add threat to the staging area. I realized I needed Eowyn to quest better, and needed to drop Eleanor since I wasn't using her ability.\n\nAdding Eowyn meant fewer turns before the troll, unless I swapped Aragorn. So I added Gloin to the lineup as well. In this 4th game I realized that lack of card drawing was also hurting me, and that some of the exhaust a hero spirit cards, as well as Common Cause, I had in there for Eleanor to use if no treacheries came up could be traded for lore cards. I only went the 4th game before swapping in Beravor\n\nIn game 5 Beravor helped me so much. I got to see 2 Gandalfs (one Snuck in, so essentially 3), both Galadhrim's Greetings, and Faramir...all of which helped either set up before taking on the troll or burning through stage 2.\n\nDishonorable mention goes to Eastern Crows, whose Surge ability directly lead to too many enemies on three of my four losses."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/56491-the-juicebox-lotr-lcg-tournament-of-the-week-1-november-20-26-2011-completed/?do=findComment&comment=559607","commentId":559607,"userName":"juicebox","timestamp":1322071331,"content":"Scoob said:\n\nThanks for the fun idea, Juicebox!\n\nFinal score was:\n\nTotal = 120\n\n\n\nYou're welcome Scoob!

So, if anyone was under the impression that they had 2 more hours (and if you make a final post within the two hour mark) this week, I will go back and make one more update in the morning (well, it'll be morning for me... gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]).

to destroy the Hill Troll in round 4. Beravor's power is brought to light with the standard play: Eowyn and Gloin quest leaving Beravor back either to defend, attack or draw cards. On the Journey to the Anduin you draw a good number of cards with this play.  \n\n\n\nCompleted the Anduin Passage (2A) by reanimating a discarded Faramir, care of a Stand a Fight, and sending in Lorien Guide, Wandering Took, Guard of the Citadel, Henamarth Riversong and Gleowine, plus all three heroes to take down the Location in 2 rounds with only locations and irrelevant events being flipped over.\n\n\n\nTwo copies of The Galadrihim’s Greeting plus Gandalf were played at this point to bring down my threat total to 21.    \n\n\n\nCompleted the Ambush on the Shore (3A) on Round 6 as the only two cards revealed were an irrelevant event and a lone Dol Gudur Orcs, which I quickly dispatched with a basic ally block followed by Gloin and Beravor going in for the finishing blow.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nIt took me multiple teams, builds and luck to get to this point and even if this doesn’t count on the weekly tournament forum I’m pretty satisfied with my score.

I thought you needed a god-hand to make something like an 84 happen, but apparently its also a combination of skill, familiarity and a lot of luck on the part of the encounter deck. \n\nI actually wasn't taking any notes during the game, but my tracker was left at 6 when I finished, so I ended in the middle of round 7 and not 6. Sorry for the mix up.\n\nI've also finished this challenge using Eowyn, Dunhere and Gloin, but with my best score only being 117.
