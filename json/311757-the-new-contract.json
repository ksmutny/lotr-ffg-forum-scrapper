But I guess this type of thing is true for all contracts, like doing Burglar's Turn in a deck with several Immune locations that you have to travel to, using Three Hunters in scenarios which require a lot of extra exhausting (like Sailing tests), etc.  \n\nSo: 100 card deck. That's a \"restriction\" as it hits consistency. But, as I've noted before with Council of the Wise decks, you don't have to build to compensate for it, you also have the option of building around it, so if you're in the mindset of selecting cards for a role (like \"defense\" or \"readying\") rather than a specific card interaction, you can still build a good deck. In fact, I could probably take a couple of my existing Council of the Wise decks, increase all copies of the cards from 1 to 2, and end up with a Perilous Journey deck that performs pretty reliably.\n\nThen: look at 2 cards, draw 1.  This could be seen as compensation for the 100 card requirement, but it's actually better than that. Without other card draw, you're getting 2 cards per round (one from standard draw and one from the contract), and going through the top 3 cards of your deck in total without even having to discard anything (the unselected card goes to the bottom of your deck. That could be a plus or a minus depending on the deck you're building).  So actually, your hand will fill up nice and fast.\n\nThe 'free' card play when you flip to side B and the no-exhaust thing for heroes.... Nice, but not worth taking a contract for.  Just icing. Searching your whole deck to get that 'free' card into play probably won't matter, as this is gonna happen most likely mid- to late-game when you're already established (and if you aren't established at that point, you're probably going to lose anyway).\n\nThe side A card draw effect is really the only reason I can imagine you would ever want to play this contract, so you'd want to stay on side A for as long as possible. That'll probably bias me toward low threat starting heroes, and staying away from the One Ring."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311757-the-new-contract/?do=findComment&comment=3999325","commentId":3999325,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1602199216,"content":"Yeah this is only contract you want to stay on side A.

I think this could reasonably include going past 50 and/or triggering your elimination."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311757-the-new-contract/?do=findComment&comment=4000091","commentId":4000091,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1602431481,"content":"So even though I built a deck that utilizes the contract, I am not quite sure the payoff is worth the price. First of all, theoretically, you could build a workable 100 card deck any time you want. Erestor + mining makes it possible. But the lack of threat reduction gives me pause as to whether or not the cost of 1 threat allowing you to essentially take 2 cards, 1 of choice, each round. A simple 50 x2 and card draw x2 at least balances out ratios. But is the 1 threat, getting you closer to elimination, worth the ability to optionally choose your card? If threat reduction were possible I would say yes, but without threat reduction, chosing this option is trading a round of play for a single card. Not worth it. Threat raising in the grey wanderer is worth it because you are granted a pool of threat to give, while you would want to run 3 heroes in this contract to maximize the benefit of the backside.\n\nSecondly, and perhaps most importantly, you don't double the size of your starting hand, OR even grant you an additional two mulligans (the first one gives you even odds on card search and hand to deck, while second allows you to equal odds of getting your ideal starting hand of 6). This is a huge oversight, or a huge cost.\n\nThe nonexhaust payout on side B is a weak payout, IMHO. Haldan and Light of Valinor, plus a plethora of readying options tells me that a nonexhaust option for all three of my heroes is not worth nearly threating out to achieve. Plus, once you flip to B, you don't even have access to your card draw anymore. In theory, by the time you flip the contract, it is expected that you ought to have your board set up. But this lends itself to a marathon style of play... since you will have to get through more of your deck to get your board established.\n\nThe better payout is that you get a built in -10 reduction, effectively raising your threat elimination level to 60 (or 55 with the ring). One could argue that two cards (galadrim's greeting) is better, and might be worth the cost. Or if running noldor, three elronds council gets you there... spirit merry is incredibly effective and beregond in a marathon game pays his debts to threat. That doesnt even mention loragorn. There are ways to control threat and I am not sure giving them all up for a one time -10 makes it helpful. (Not to mention the controversy surrounding threat above 50 listed in the above discussion)\n\nSo to recap:\n\nCost--\n\n1. Double deck\n\n2. No threat control\n\n3. Wacked out ratios in starting hand size and draw while on side A.\n\n4. More cards cost threat\n\nPayout--\n\n1. Card control\n\n2. Threat elmination level raised \n\n3. Nonexhaust questing heroes.\n\n \n\nI think this is the least effective of all the contracts.

Many of the decks (bar the bonded friendship and messenger of the king) could be built without the need of the contract so what incentive does the contract give.... none! Because invariably the deck restrictions that are imposed by the contract goes too far in the opposite direction of an auto include..  they make the contracts an auto exclude. \n\nIf I was designing them I'd have made them Havens (player location such as Rivendell, Edoras, Blue Mountains, Lorien etc deployed to the side) that just granted benefits along as certain conditions were in effect, eg only have one hero, or have no allies on the table. You could even have the havens be a side deck where you could put traited cards and cards associated with a trait) under them (like the door way cards in deciphers Star Trek TNG card game ) and play them from there with discounts etc. \n\nThe game is already hard and each cycle increases the difficulty so I see no problem in creating some op themed cards for those who want to use them in thematic play. \n\nContracts open deck building options with one hand and restrict them with the other, they offer some game balance effects with one hand and take them away with the other. \n\nSure they're not cards that you can't play without, but they are also cards you can't play with. Most of them feel great but play flat very much like The End Comes and you're much better off sticking to the normal deck building methods with all the allies you want, all the heroes you're allowed, all the threat reduction  you can and as many attachments as you want. \n\n "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311757-the-new-contract/?do=findComment&comment=4002283","commentId":4002283,"userName":"TrueLolzor","timestamp":1602959084,"content":"I don't think contracts should have ever been \"auto include\", otherwise there wouldn't be much point.

I feel like this might be getting overlooked. Set up a bunch of Valour allies like Veteran of Osgiliath, Angbor the Fearless, Honour Guard, and Defender of Cair Andros. Then when you know you're going to flip to side B this turn, make sure you have 2 Leadership resources ready. Go all-in on questing, and when you flip to side B, pull and play Need Drives Them at a 3-cost reduction, making it free. Now your entire board is ready to attack or defend. Play Rallying Cry at the start of the Combat phase, and now every time Honour Guard exhausts and discards to cancel 5 points of damage, you get him in your hand. Plus any Defenders of Cair Andros that die despite their 4 defense are still available to bring back as well, albeit expensively. You'd be able to soak a massive amount of damage and still have plenty of attack power left to, most likely, clear the board of enemies.\n\nAlso, would Pillars of the Kings (\"set your threat to 40\") count as \"reducing\" your threat under the terms of the contract, or not? I can't seem to find any rulings on whether \"set a value to X\" counts as increasing or reducing that value for the sake of effects that trigger on increases or reductions, or effects that forbid increases or reductions.

And even if Pillars of the Kings is forbidden by this contract, a Leadership-Tactics Valour deck could produce some pretty incredible contract-flip turns.\n\nEdit: I don't see any rules about \"set\" interacting with \"cannot be reduced\" in the LotR LCG.

There might be some common ground design-wise, but they are two quite separate things.\n\nIf you look at the online rules reference for LotR and the online rules reference for other FFG LCGs such as L5R, you'll find a lot of rules in common, because FFG seems to be starting from a basic set of rule ideas and tweaking it to fit each game. E.g., compare the \"Modifiers\" entry in the LotR rules reference [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/90/19/90191e4e-a341-4379-b398-5963b7a87ebf/mec01_online_only_rules_reference_for_website.pdf] and the L5R rules reference [https://images-cdn.fantasyflightgames.com/filer_public/63/72/637221ff-45bb-458c-ac01-639844244adf/l5c01-online_rulesreference_v15-d25xp164j1gc-compressed.pdf], and you'll find that both games have almost the same Modifiers rules, and they also have practically the same rules for Cancel effects, for the word \"Cannot\", for the concepts of \"Play\" vs \"Put into play\", and much more. And the places where the rules vary, it tends to be in ways that make sense for that game (e.g., in L5R each player has two decks, the Conflict and Dynasty decks, so the play/put into play rules mention that fact, whereas that language is omitted in the LotR rules reference where there's one deck per player). That's why I wanted to verify whether LotR's omission of the \"Set to X is not prevented by \"cannot be increased/decreased\" effects\" language present in L5R was deliberate, because there's a decent chance that it wasn't, and in the absence of a ruling it would make sense to resolve an ambiguity the same way other FFG LCGs resolve the same ambiguity. Now that I know there's a ruling, my question has been answered; thanks for that.\n\nEdit: And the reason I figured LotR's omission of that language present in L5R might not be deliberate is because LotR was FFG's first LCG, and the early years (I picked it up when it was first released) had a LOT of rules changes. In particular, the Modifiers rules went through a couple of iterations before landing in their final state, with some back-and-forth about whether lasting modifiers would be recalculated or not, for example. And so when I saw that the LotR online rules reference dated from 2018, and the L5R rules reference dated from 2020, I figured there might have been another FFG decision about how to treat modifiers in the past two years, which they just forgot to retrofit into their first LCG. Now I know it was a deliberate decision, not an omission.\n\nEdited October 21 by rmunn"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/311757-the-new-contract/?do=findComment&comment=4014119","commentId":4014119,"userName":"player3351457","timestamp":1605312932,"content":"My buddy and I ran my mining deck with this contract across from an erestor-elrond-denethor deck against Attack on Dol Guldur.
