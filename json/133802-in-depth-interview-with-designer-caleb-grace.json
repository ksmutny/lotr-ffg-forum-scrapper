Really shows who's working on our beloved game and tells us his story. So next time something gets delayed, you at least know that it's aalso not his fault and that he hates delays too. It ahowed his love for this game, he even played it before designing it, and how much work goes into everything. Thanks guys and thank you Caleb!\n\nFor the spoiler:\n\ni think it went like this: \"I ca tell you that [a new Theoden] will be released.\n\nBrian:\"So can you tell us when this [new version of Theoden] is coming?\n\nCaleb:\"The [new version of Theoden] is coming in the Saga expasion the Treason of Saruman.\n\nAlso I found it quite funny when Brian says :'something that they can only know if they were listening to our episode'. Brandon: 'a nugget'. Instead of that we got nothing but dolphin sound, not even dolphin meat, lol."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1433549","commentId":1433549,"userName":"Pharmboys2013","timestamp":1423002223,"content":"Have still only listened to the first 2 hours of this mammoth episode but absolutely loving it. I forget who mentioned it in the podcast but they said how things have been \"different\"....for the better since Caleb took over and I think possibly a good adjective would be there is a lot of transparency between the player base and the designers.  Its incredibly refreshing to hear from the design team especially in such a candid matter regarding the process of design, the individual's own fandom and thought process, etc.  I feel lucky to be a part of such a unique gaming situation. I hope Caleb and Matt will continue to have access to the community in this manner."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1435575","commentId":1435575,"userName":"divinityofnumber","timestamp":1423103667,"content":"Excellent show, Boyos (as Brandon would say)! It's funny, I actually say boyos relatively often. I don't like Jar Jar. It's just sort of whimsical. When I first heard Brandon say it, I felt happy that someone else out there also uses it. \n\n \n\nPLEASE KEEP DOING LONG EPISODES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n \n\nThe fact that you guys are not concerned about going 2+ hours per episode is AWESOME. I do a fair amount of commuting, and I really enjoy all of the content that you all produce. Three cheers for the longer format. Yes, number crunching and strict strategy talk are nice sometimes, but so is hearing people who love the game simply having a discussion and sharing first impressions of cards, funny stories, etc. The show has a lot of depth because you're not afraid of some free-form discussion and that really adds a warmth and personality to the show. When I listen, I feel like I am hanging out with a room full of people who also love the game and sharing insights and laughs, not simply listening to someone go over the basic factual information that a lot of review type sites/podcasts/articles do. \n\n \n\nKeep up the good work!\n\nEdited February 5, 2015 by divinityofnumber"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1435928","commentId":1435928,"userName":"Riki39561","timestamp":1423131722,"content":"Part of what made this episode so entertaining is that Caleb (and the CotR guys) just come across as extremely likeable.\n\n \n\nIt also didn't feel like an author on a book tour trying to drum up interest in product, but rather someone talking about a genuine passion project who actually wanted to be there.  As a consumer it's always nice to see something you are passionate about be represented with the same enthusiasm from a content creators standpoint.  Although I do wish we had more players (and events) in the UK.\n\n \n\nOh and Theodon in saga box three isn't really a spoiler at this point, unlike say, the Gollum hero coming in box four. *drops mic*\n\nEdited February 5, 2015 by Riki"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1467071","commentId":1467071,"userName":"Glowwyrm","timestamp":1424995299,"content":"While I think he said Theoden, and a new Theoden was sort of teased in the Helm's Deep quest article, what if he said Snowmane?  That would draw the same kind of reaction from the COTR crew, and would be an appropriate spoil for their show, since they've been begging for a Snowmane card since Theoden hero was released.  Here's hoping we get both in Treason of Saruman (though Snowmane has to show up by the Return of the King box). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1467090","commentId":1467090,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1424996560,"content":"Snowmane: Attach to a Rohan character.  Attached character gains +1 willpower (+2 willpower if attached character is Theoden) and a Leadership icon.\n\n \n\nResponse: after attached hero quests successfully, exhaust Snowmane to ready attached hero and another Rohan character."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1467555","commentId":1467555,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1425038783,"content":"That sounds like a very expensive card."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/133802-in-depth-interview-with-designer-caleb-grace/?do=findComment&comment=1467566","commentId":1467566,"userName":"monkeyrama","timestamp":1425039369,"content":"Kinda like an unexpected courage plus Celebrian's Stone.
