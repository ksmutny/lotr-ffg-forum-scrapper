I guess you have to hope that the shadow card dealt does not have a shadow effect...  The play my friend and I were playing was no Shadow effect was dealt with the Snare in play on the Nazgul however it didnt really matter cause we still lost due to threat generation with the objectives and the Doomed locations and monsters coming up even Gandalf only delayed it a little.  It is tough scenario with 2 players havent tried with 3 or 4 might be doable then."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/45860-forest-snare-with-nazgul/?do=findComment&comment=459730","commentId":459730,"userName":"zambo226","timestamp":1303893354,"content":"daveman006 said:\n\nHere is a question, does a creature with Forest Snare still get a Shadow effect dealt to it?  If so then the Nazgul of Dol Guldur is still bad even when snared.
