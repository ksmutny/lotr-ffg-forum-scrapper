MMG's shadow can only be interpreted as an effect that resolves immediately.\n\nThis is to be distinguished from Pursued by Shadow & Wargs:\n\n> Quote\n> \n> Shadow: Attacking enemy gets 1 [attack]. (2 [attack] instead if this attack is undefended.)\n\nNow we are in muddier waters. Does Wargs' shadow set up a lasting effect? I say it does*. If so, then the order you flip the shadow cards doesn't matter, as this (encounter card) effect isn't actually calculated for real until framework step 6.4.3â€”i.e., it is not fixed at the time of shadow card flip at 6.4.2â€”which is past the time the attack would have become undefended no matter which order you flipped.\n\n(*: Looong arguments have been had about how long shadow effects like the oneÂ onÂ Wargs should last. I defer discussion of this except to say that it should certainly last through at least step 6.4.4 of the attack in question, and that wording in the early lifetime of this game often suffers from this kind of imprecision.)\n\nEdited September 26, 2019 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300477-what-happens-when-a-shadow-effect-discards-the-defender/?do=findComment&comment=3793868","commentId":3793868,"userName":"AllWingsStandyingBy","timestamp":1569521236,"content":"Thanks for these insights.\n\nThis makes Pursued By Shadows a particularly nasty shadow card, because unless you control and have already exhausted other allies (either to quest or to perform some sort of action), it means the attacking hit unavoidably will end up coming in undefended which can often then be hero-slaying. But over-exhausting allies to have an available non-defending exhausted chump for a possible PbS sacrifice means those allies end up risking damage/death to Necromancer's Reach or the like flipping during the questing phase...\n\nI love and hate how brutal this game can be... heh."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/300477-what-happens-when-a-shadow-effect-discards-the-defender/?do=findComment&comment=3793903","commentId":3793903,"userName":"sappidus","timestamp":1569523511,"content":"> 36 minutes ago, AllWingsStandyingBy said:\n> \n> I love and hate how brutal this game can be... heh.\n\nIf you're still playing Core/1st cycle, you ain't seen nothing yet in terms of table-flippingly brutal encounter cardsâ€¦Â ðŸ‘¹"}]}
