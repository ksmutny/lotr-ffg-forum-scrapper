So if you have UC on Eowyn after she commit to the quest you ca ready her for Attack or defense later in Combat phase."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59653-unexpected-courage/?do=findComment&comment=586052","commentId":586052,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1327733780,"content":"bear in mind that characters can only attack against 1 certain enemy once per round, and they can also defend against one enemy at a time\n\njust think of it as 1 action per enemy, so you can use UC to defend against orcs then ready to kill them"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59653-unexpected-courage/?do=findComment&comment=586070","commentId":586070,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1327736067,"content":"richsabre said:\n\nbear in mind that characters can only attack against 1 certain enemy once per round, and they can also defend against one enemy at a time\n\njust think of it as 1 action per enemy, so you can use UC to defend against orcs then ready to kill them\n\n\n\nA hero candefend against multiple enemies though, as the enemies attacks will be dealt one after the other. You could thus defend with a hero against enemy A, ready him with UC and then defend against enemy B. I know you're talking about defending against a single enemy, but the way you phrased it it could be misinterpreted (at least by non-native speakers like me)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59653-unexpected-courage/?do=findComment&comment=586181","commentId":586181,"userName":"Svenn","timestamp":1327753069,"content":"Pudsey said:\n\nJust a quick question - if Unexpected Courage is played on Eowyn can she commit to the same quest round twice?

Thus, if you commit a character and ready that character again the window for committing characters is already gone."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/59653-unexpected-courage/?do=findComment&comment=586437","commentId":586437,"userName":"gatharion","timestamp":1327803287,"content":"Svenn said:\n\n \n\n \n\nYou have to commit all characters to the quest at the same time.

Just like you have to declare all of your attacking character for a particular enemy at the same time.\n\n \n\nAlong this vein, Aragorn cannot commit to a quest, spend a resource to ready, and then commit himself again."}]}
