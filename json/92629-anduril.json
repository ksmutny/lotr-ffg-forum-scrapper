De donde eres tu?\n\nYeah, you're right. The game's been pretty much like in a stillborn state from the beggining, having a few players here and there but very far apart; no community at all and the game's not endorsed at all in LGS´s in favour to the other five lcg's out there (for not being competitive, I suppose), so as may have guessed I'm a complete solo player (sometimes I bring the game to our MTG group and played it a couple times). But I completely enjoy the game and support it whenever I can. While there are better games (I'm not gonna act like there aren't any better Middle earth card games and such I still believe this game has done an incredible job, mostly because of how ambitious it is."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/92629-anduril/?do=findComment&comment=897499","commentId":897499,"userName":"Noccus","timestamp":1382897225,"content":"Sorry for off-topic chatting, but:\n\nSoy de Holanda.
