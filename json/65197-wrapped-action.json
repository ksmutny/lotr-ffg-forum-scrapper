(A hero needs to be next to a wrapped hero to help the hero that is drawn under water…) And also by common sense, not every player is allowed to trigger the action of Wrapped. (Players can pay costs, like exhausting a character, only with cards they control (p. 25 of the rules). So the \"you control\" part of the combat action would be totally superfluous if any player were thought to be allowed to trigger the action.)\n\nBut I think the card is badly worded. The rules-lawyer in me wants to nit-pick on this: gui%C3%B1o.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/gui%C3%B1o.gif]\n\nBy the rules and the card as it is written, every player could trigger the action. Usually, only the controller of a card can trigger its action (p. 23 of the rules) . But the player controlling the wrapped hero doesn't get control of the attachment (FAQ 1.06), because it still is an encounter card! When an encounter card effect doesn't specify who may trigger it, we must assume that every player is allowed to trigger it. (If this were not the case, no one could claim an unclaimed Gandalf's Map by its action, or trigger the Warg Lair's response…) So every player could trigger the combat action of Wrapped!, too. If you read it literally."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65197-wrapped-action/?do=findComment&comment=637467","commentId":637467,"userName":"jjeagle","timestamp":1338308337,"content":"\"An Action on an encounter card in play can be triggered by any player, following normal restrictions on triggering abilities.\" (KD rules sheet)\n\nI think this means that any player can exhaust a hero to remove a Wrapped from any (other) player's hero."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/65197-wrapped-action/?do=findComment&comment=637471","commentId":637471,"userName":"kjpw_88","timestamp":1338308572,"content":"jjeagle said:\n\n\"An Action on an encounter card in play can be triggered by any player, following normal restrictions on triggering abilities.\" (KD rules sheet)\n\nI think this means that any player can exhaust a hero to remove a Wrapped from any (other) player's hero.\n\n\n\nI was thinking in the same way as the post before, with no one controlling the card.\n\nI never even saw this on the Khazad Dum sheet!
