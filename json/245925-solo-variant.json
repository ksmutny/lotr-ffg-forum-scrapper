What you can try is searching your deck for 1 specific Card before you draw your Hand, but therefore loosing your Mulligan Option.\n\nLeader Option more or less takes 1/4 of your starting threat, so you get a free hero. I'd just have taken 75% of the total cost as starting threat, but the difference is marginal. The Leader-death rule shouldn't come into Play too often as most quests don't end well once heroes start to fall :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png] \n\nRanged and Sentinel only being useful in multiplayer (+handful of quests with specific enemies :D) for me always was to compensation for having to manage which Player gets engaged with which enemy (what isn't necessary or even possible in solo Play) so I wouldn't have changed something in that regard, but as you say you're having a hard time with the quests go for it, game's supposed to be fun after all ;) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_wink.png]\n\n \n\nThere isn't really much to criticize or improve as changing the rules in a singleplayer game is just for your Entertainment and I don't see gamebreaking Problems :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png] .

Would Galadriel really send you on a dangerous mission with no support? Add in some Leaf-wrapped Lembas or a Phial of Galadriel to help ward off hunger and other evils.

I'm pretty sure I had trouble with Carrok when it first came out. But now I'm confident I could beat it 19/20 times with a cardpool of just a single core set.\n\nThere's a sort of trick to that quest, and once you figure it out the difficulty drops from a 7 to a 1.\n\n\n\nStall in stage 1 for a looooong time. Build up a huge army. Then use cards like Galadhrim's Greeting and Sneak Attack+Gandalf to lower your threat and advance to stage 2. Then simply pull down the trolls 1 at a time and kill them.\n\n\n\nI will say that the quests in the Core Set and Mirkwood cycle favor higher player counts more clearly than the quests that come after.

The next tricky quest is Return to Mirkwood which is the final AP in the cycle - no spoilers though!\n\nThe next cycle (Khazad Dum) is truly excellent both in terms of player cards and adventure packs - in my opinion it's a major step up from the first cycle and far better suited to solo play. If you haven't started investing in that yet I recommend that you keep an eye-out for it, particularly as it can be hard to find.\n\nAs well as the variants mentioned above, there is also the 'Fellowship mode' which simulates 2 decks in one hand (i.e. 6 heroes but threat is only for 3). The advantage of that is there is less book-keeping than having two hands. Rules for it are in the files section of the BGG files page for LoTR LCG\n\nEnjoy!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245925-solo-variant/?do=findComment&comment=3481745","commentId":3481745,"userName":"GILLIES291","timestamp":1537804038,"content":"I feel like another easy mode is just to include the fellowship hero Frodo and his one ring, which you do if you play campaign so probably isn't too imbalanced if you want a thematic boost to your solo experience without changing the rules too much. He gets an extra resource around and helps out with frodo's intuition. \n\nHave anyone else tried running the fourth fellowship hero in normal adventure pack quests? Or using the boons? Did it grossly imbalance or was it a nice help? Because so far having only just started the game, it's far far easier playing multiplayer versus single player. One extra encounter card draw for 3 whole heroes and their resources/decks. \n\n \n\nSolo I have just beaten Journey down the Anduin after many many tries."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245925-solo-variant/?do=findComment&comment=3482095","commentId":3482095,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1537817276,"content":"The core set is much easier two player than one player IMO, but that doesn't hold for all future quests or even for all of the quests in the Mirkwood Cycle."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245925-solo-variant/?do=findComment&comment=3482274","commentId":3482274,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1537823714,"content":"To me most part of the game (including all of the first cycle) is easier with two player.\n\nI use to play with or without the boons, and with and without the fellowship hero in the saga, I found that it make a big difference."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245925-solo-variant/?do=findComment&comment=3482301","commentId":3482301,"userName":"dalestephenson","timestamp":1537824950,"content":"Rouxxor, you think Emyn Muil is easier with two players?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/245925-solo-variant/?do=findComment&comment=3482318","commentId":3482318,"userName":"Rouxxor","timestamp":1537825711,"content":"I'm not sure.

Have one travel phase for each two cards seem not that low as long as you keep exploring an active location each turn, and for the same average of questing per deck and reveal threat per encounter card you will be able to advance twice as fast on the active location.\n\nI agree that 3 players, or even worse 4 players is worse for Emyn Muil.
