It's going to massively change the playstyles of certain factions.\n\nImagine a new LotR core which yanked A Test of Will, Hasty Stroke, Northern Tracker, and Unexpected Courage from Spirit.

A charitable (or is it apologetic?) perspective is that FFG is pulled in several directions for their games' core sets, and they chose to sacrifice a certain amount of recently-new player goodwill in order to Save the Game as a whole in the longer term. The whole LCG rotation thing is new to the company, and it remains to be seen whether they can pull it off.\n\nEdited September 13, 2017 by sappidus"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/258464-so-netrunner-just-got-a-revised-core-set-are-we-next/?do=findComment&comment=2983183","commentId":2983183,"userName":"CaffeineAddict","timestamp":1505398543,"content":"A new core set sounds Ok, as long as it's not a reboot.
