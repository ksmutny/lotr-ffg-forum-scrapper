Went with Eleanor cause I like her art a bit more\n\nB - Mirlonde - While i love Thalin's ability, I've been using and liking Mirlonde a lot this cycle especially with all the recent lore love in player cards\n\nC - Pippin - Just not a fan of Brand, maybe its the multiplayer only ability, maybe its the art. Plus the new Pippin is really just awesome in both the aspects i dislike in Brand\n\nD - Prince Imrahil - Strong often overshadowed character whos ability will always be useful. Not the biggest fan of Bilbo tho he does have his uses.\n\nE - Faramir - Faramir is one of my faves and spirit pippin blows. Easiest decision i've made yet.\n\nF - Elrohir - Also a big fan of the elf brothers. Gloin seems to have dipped into obsoleteness now anyway\n\nG - Hama - Cool art and an amazing ability. Hama is just good stuff\n\nH - Nori - More consistent threat reduction and he's holding a beer! whats not to like?\n\nI - Elladan - Like i already said, I'm a fan of the elf brothers. Do like Bifur's art tho\n\nJ - Denethor - Love Denethor's scrying ability and he still holds up quite well defensively too.

Really sorry for Strider who's one of the best lore heroes and has lots of decks built around him but I really dig Thalin.\n\n \n\nR - Boromir - another tough one...I think Pippin's gonna be a blast (with his hobbit friends a nuclear blast), but Boromir's Boromir...if only his art was that of the leadership version he'd make top 3 in my best hero chart...really awsome\n\n \n\nS - Aragorn - you need a few cards to make him really, really good, but with only steward of gondor he shines already...Imrahil's good and I like both his card and the character (by the way the card is very thematic) but King Elessar wins\n\n \n\nT - Faramir - haven't even tried him yet but I know I'm gonna enjoy playing him...love ranged, rangers and Faramir himself\n\n \n\nU - Legolas - Sorry that I had to choose between two of my 4 or 5 absolute favourite heroes...I choose Legolas though...he's my number 1 anyway\n\n \n\nV - Hama - we'll he's my number 2\n\n \n\nW - Dain - need I say more ?\n\n \n\nX - Sam - Arguably the best leadership hero in the game...and he's not out yet (not for me anyway), plus he's one of my favourite characters in tolkien lore\n\n \n\nY - Bifur - not that I like Bifur that much but I still haven't found a good use for this version of Boromir\n\n \n\nZ - Thorin Oakenshield - this is the toughest choice...both are good and I really like them...I choose Thorin only because I like him better in tolkien lore.\n\n \n\nAA - Elrond - Again...need I say more ?\n\n \n\nAB - Bard the Bowman - He's unplayable in solo play...and I know it...and I was really disappointed because he's one of my favourite characters in tolkien lore (favourite from the hobbit)...but well...I'm still gonna vote for him because he's Bard the Bowman, slayer of Smaug...and because in multi he's pretty good.\n\n \n\nAC - Beregond - Another really tough one...both are awsome heroes, and I use both of them a lot (theodred has been in my decks since the beginning and I don't think he's ever going to leave) but Beregond has a place in my heart from the books. Plus he's a pretty amazing hero himself...I love playing him in multiplayer with my courage and defense deck (Beregond+Gondorian Shield+Spear of the Citadel+Goblin Cleaver+Swift Strike+Behind strong Walls....+Stand together with Gondorian Spearman+Spear of the Citadel) ok I'll stop...it's so much fun though XD...\n\n \n\nAD - Merry - I never tried Balin yet, I don't like when you have to change something bad for something unknown (potentially worse) plus merry is a real beast (in a hobbit deck he rocks, in a monotactics deck with theoden he over-rocks)\n\n \n\n \n\nwell my love for tactics is pretty explicit...7 tactics heroes, 4 lore, 4 leadership and 1 spirit...(well my not-so-much-love for spirit heroes as well)...\n\nEdited September 6, 2013 by DevastazioneH88"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=859831","commentId":859831,"userName":"Ellareth","timestamp":1378512692,"content":"I cannot believe some of the turn ups.\nDid not expect any of Noldor Elves to win, but 2 of them survived!\n\n \n\nHere are my votes for round of 16:\n\n \n\nO. Glorfindel(s) - Beravor is good, but Spirifindel is broken.\nP. Ori - Ori's draw power is just so good, and his stats are competetive as well.\nQ. Aragorn(Lo) - As much as I think Thalin is must have in 3~4 player games, Loragorn's ability is too good.\nR. Pippin(Lo) - Despite the fact Boromir is one of my favourite characters and I've never even played with Lore Pippin yet, I just prefer drawing over combat prowness.\nS. Imrahil - I find Imrahil's ability to be more versatile than Aragorn's\nT. Beorn - Beorn has proven himself again and again that he is a beast. Faramir has his uses but they are limited.\nU. Legolas - Legolas is to this day one of solid go to tactics hero.\nV. Hama - If we were back in Mirkwood Cycle I might have picked Eowyn. But Eowyn's Will Power is replacable while Hama's thicket of shinanigan is not.\nW. Dain Ironfoot - Nori is a good dwarf, but Dain is broken.\nX. Sam Gamgee - To be honest I'm surprised Theoden is in round of 36 by default. Better heroes than him have lost in the prelimenary.\nY. Boromir(Le) - I feel like Bifur is the better hero in isolated situation, but chose Boromir because Bifur is shadowed by Ori whereas Leadermir remains to be only Gondor synerging hero.\nZ. Denethor - Likewise, Thorin is probably better hero in isolation, but he is outshadowed by Dain while Denethor is the only encounter deck manipulating hero.\nAA. Elrond - Time for you to rest in peace Lore Glorfindel. Cannot believe you made it thsi far.\nAB. Frodo Baggins - Bard is good hero in multiplayer, but Frodo is great hero in any sized game.\nAC. Theodred - Theodred's resource generation is not to be trifled with.\nAD. Merry - Balin is good, but Merry is the only tactics Hobbit hero.\n\nEdited September 7, 2013 by Ellareth"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=859840","commentId":859840,"userName":"Khamul The Easterling","timestamp":1378513636,"content":"O - Glorfindel\n\nP - Gimli\n\nQ - Thalin\n\nR - Pippin\n\nS - Aragorn\n\nT - Beorn\n\nU - Legolas\n\nV - Eowyn \n\nW - Dain\n\nX - Sam Gamgee\n\nY -Borimir\n\nZ - Thorin\n\nAA - Elrond\n\nAB - Bard\n\nAC Beregond\n\nAD -Balin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=859853","commentId":859853,"userName":"legolas18","timestamp":1378514870,"content":"O- Glorfindel - I SO badly would like to pick Beravor instead, but if I'm going truthfully, I have to pick Spirfindel. My condolences to Beravor.\n\nP- Gimli - I'm gonna go with the classic core hero on this one, although I really do love Ori. But I feel that Gimli is much more versatile, mainly because his ability isn't triggered by dwarves. It's just through pure damage.\n\nQ- Aragorn (Lore)- Thalin had my vote against Mirlonde, but I'm gonna have to go with Aragorn. Strider is too much for Thalin to handle, unfortunately.\n\nR- Boromir (Tactics)- I think this one may be a little unfair on my part, as I haven't been able to try Pippin out yet. But based on my initial thoughts of him, I'm going to have to choose Boromir. A very useful hero, and I love tactics!\n\nS- Prince Imrahil - A big portion of this vote goes to the fact that Imrahil has the Gondor trait and Aragorn doesn't. Yes, you could Steward of Gondor him, but it's so much easier to have an already-Gondor hero for a Gondor deck. \n\nT- Faramir - These two are polar opposites. One is very straightforward, and the other takes some time to make use of. But I'm gonna have to go with the latter, since he's the star of trap decks, which I love SO much.\n\nU- Legolas - Definitely have to go with Legolas for this one. I think his ability is very useful, especially in a mono-tactics deck, and he doesn't require a counterpart to use. Sorry twins!\n\nV- Eowyn - Out of the two Rohan heroes competing in this bracket, I'm going to have to pick Eowyn because of her astounding Willpower. Hama is useful on some occasions, but not enough to beat Eowyn.\n\nW- Dain Ironfoot - Sorry Nori, but this one is pretty easy to decide on.\n\nX- Theoden - Sorry, but my passion for mono-tactics is going to beat the dedicated hobbit. Hoping that Theoden won't let me down on his premiere!! \n\nY- Boromir (Leadership)- I love a good Gondor deck, and I rarely use Bifur even in dwarf decks, since I usually prefer his ally version. \n\nZ- Thorin Oakenshield - This was definitely a tough choice. But since I usually play two-handed, if I ever use Denethor, his ability is never used.\n\nAA- Elrond - Sorry Glorfindel, but it appears that this one might be unanimous. At least be proud you made it this far.\n\nAB- Bard the Bowman - Definitely one of my favorite tactics heroes, and I never use Frodo's ability for some reason. Go Tactics!\n\nAC- Beregond - Sorry Theodred. You may be able to defeat poor Dunhere, but I'm afraid you don't really stand a chance against this Gondor behemoth of a defender.\n\nAD- Merry - Another one I had to contemplate on... I do love Balin's ability, but I think I'm going to like this little hobbit more.\n\n \n\nWell, I think I voted for every Tactics hero on the list (except Beorn)!

The count has been updated. Special thanks to legolas18, Ellareth and DevastazioneH88 for some great commentary.\n\n \n\nMatch-up spotlight!\n\n \n\nTHE BOWMAN VS THE RING-BEARER\n\n \n\nFrodo Baggins handily dispatched the Gondorian maiden, Caldara, but he now faces steep competition in Bard the Bowman.   Of the original 7 hobbit competitors, only Sam, Merry, Pippin (Lore) and Frodo remain. During the previous round, Merry committed fratricide in offing fellow hobbit, Fatty, Bilbo was sent back to the Shire by Prince Imrahil, and Pippin (S) was absolutely spanked by Faramir. Though we are in the early stages of the game, Bard is leading Frodo 4-3. Currently, Frodo and Pippin are fairing the worst of the hobbits still in the competition.\n\n \n\nAsked concerning his match-up with the diminutive hobbit, Bard said, \"I knew Frodo's uncle even though I never met Frodo himself. The fight almost does not seem fair after slaying a dragon, but, alas, I want to reach the next round. Plus, I'd also like to say my art rules. I mean I should win based on that merit alone.\"\n\n \n\nFrodo also seemed confident. \"It's still early in the match and I'm confident I'll pull through,\" said Frodo. \"Plus what's slaying a dragon compared with saving all of Middle Earth? Great props to Bard for the whole Smaug-slaying thing, but it's not even a comparison. Also, has everyone forgotten about my sweet defense mechanism?\"\n\n \n\n \n\nffg_bard-the-bowman-otd.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_bard-the-bowman-otd.jpg]    vs    ffg_frodo-baggins-catc.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_frodo-baggins-catc.jpg]\n\nEdited September 7, 2013 by Samwise Gamgee"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=859866","commentId":859866,"userName":"Teamjimby","timestamp":1378518008,"content":"O: Glorfindel - Too strong for Beravor, although he's definitely not my favorite\n\nP: Gimli - Giving a purpose to citadel plate since 2011\n\nQ: Thalin - I love direct damage decks\n\nR: Pippin - I hate the art on Boromir(T) and I've been looking forward to hobbits since I first played the game\n\nS: Aragorn - Practically the same as Imrahil, but cooler and access to Aragorn-specific items\n\nT: Faramir - I loved playing Beorn in the Hobbit quests, but I love lore, Gondor, and rangers even more\n\nU: Legolas - Elrohir is top 15 for me, but Legolas is top 5\n\nV: Eowyn - Hama is nice but there are a lot of good tactics heroes.  Eowyn is sorely needed in the spirit sphere\n\nW: Nori - I refuse to play Dain because he's OP.  Nori is one of my favorite Dwarves, too.\n\nX: Sam - Looking forward to the hobbits and he's the best one.  I also like Theoden and think he gets picked on too much\n\nY: Boromir - Art is great, although his ability is mostly worthless right now\n\nZ: Denethor - Still a good defender (esp. with burning brand and gondorian shield) and his ability works nicely when you don't have to defend\n\nAA: Elrond - I might love his healing bonus even more than Vilya.\n\nAB: Bard - tough call, but I don't actually own Frodo because CatC was out of print when I started playing\n\nAC: Beregond - A staple in every tactics deck.  Great art, too\n\nAD: Merry - A tactics Hobbit?!?  Sign me up! "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=859887","commentId":859887,"userName":"hildargo","timestamp":1378521030,"content":"O - Glorfindel-Don't get me wrong, I like Beravor, but Glorfindel is just too good.

I didnt vote for her in round 1...so...\n\n \n\nP - Gimli - Really tough decision.  Gimli won the mental battle for still being a sturdy beast and the fond memories of crushing the stronger enemies of the core set with the proud elf equipped with a citadel plate and possibly a dwarven axe.\n\n \n\nQ - Aragorn (lore) - One of the best arts, one of the best abilities, for one of the best characters.  I expect lore Aragorn to make it deep in this tourney, sorry Thalin but your fictitious existence cant compare to the king. \n\n \n\nR - Pippin (lore) - Tactics Boromir is an absolute beast no doubt about it, but his downfall for my vote is the fact that he looks cross-eyed in the picture.  Yes, that is my reasoning... may the hobbit advance\n\n \n\nS - Aragorn (leadership) - Even though I really like the prince, it is just so much fun to deck out leadership Aragorn with all his toys and attachments.  His ability gives him so much versatility and its not hard to offset the cost.  One of the originals and still one of the best.\n\n \n\nT - Faramir - Another tough decision but I had to go with prob my favorite character.  Love the art on both cards tho\n\n \n\nU - Legolas - I just dont think Elrohir has the mental fortitude to continue this tournament with his brother left behind in the previous round.  His heart just isnt in it.  I expect Legolas to progress through this round just as easy as he progress through locations during the combat phase.\n\n \n\nV - Hama - Very challenging decision between the two Rohan heroes, but Eowyn is a bit one dimensional for my tastes.  Hama has so many cool things he can pull off and it seems like every set or two theres a new combo around him that can make for some fun decks.\n\n \n\nW - Nori - Nothing against Dain, all things considered he's probably the most powerful hero in this list...I'm just bored with him.  And Nori still has that beer... \n\n \n\nX - Sam -  Theoden's superb art cant save him from his own mediocre ability.  Sam takes the cake on this one, and odds are, he loves cake.\n\n \n\nY - Boromir (leadership) - Comes down to one thing. The art.  Boom.\n\n \n\nZ - Denethor - Probably my hardest decision of this round.  I really like Thorin not only as a player card but as a character but it wasnt enough to make me not vote for the versatile steward that is Denethor.  That scheming noble just gives me so many playing options for me not to vote for him\n\n \n\nAA - Elrond - How did lore glorfindel even make it to this round?? The cinderalla story stops here.  Elrond is a boss, absolutely everything about is character and especially the card just screams power.  Love it.\n\n \n\nAB - Bard the Bowman - While i think Frodo is a much better hero, I just really like Bard as character.  Seems like a genuine bad@ss.  Thats worth a vote i think\n\n \n\nAC - Beregond - While Theodred is universally helpful, he is almost always replaceable as well.  Beregond is just an absolute stud.  Reminds me of wolverine...He's the best there is at what he does. #defense \n\n \n\nAD - Balin - Made my case in hall of beorn's competition for why Balin is undervalued.  The dwarf is always a solid option and I think he can stave off this quirky upstart from the shire."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=859979","commentId":859979,"userName":"kyrie","timestamp":1378532950,"content":"O - Glorfindel (Spirit)\n\nP - Ori\n\nQ - Aragorn (Lore)\n\nR - Boromir (Tactics)\n\nS - Prince Imrahil\n\nT - Beorn\n\nU - Legolas\n\nV - Eowyn\n\nW - Dain Ironfoot\n\nX - Theoden\n\nY - Bifur\n\nZ - Thorin Oakenshield\n\nAA - Elrond\n\nAB - Frodo Baggins\n\nAC - Beregond\n\nAD - Balin"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=860028","commentId":860028,"userName":"iznax","timestamp":1378545327,"content":"O - Glorfindel (S)\nP - Gimli\nQ - Aragorn (Lo)\nR - Boromir (T)\nS - Aragorn (Le)\nT - Beorn\nU - Legolas\nV - Eowyn\nW - Nori\nX - Theoden\nY - Bifur\nZ - Thorin\nAA - Elrond\nAB - Bard the Bowman\nAC - Beregond\nAD - Ballin\n\nEdited September 7, 2013 by iznax"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=860029","commentId":860029,"userName":"Jekzer","timestamp":1378545468,"content":"O - Glorfindel (S)\n\nP - Gimli\n\nQ - Aragorn (Lo)\n\nR - Boromir (T)\n\nS -  Aragorn (Le)\n\nT - Faramir\n\nU - Legolas\n\nV - Éowyn\n\nW - Dáin\n\nX - Sam Gamgee\n\nY - Boromir (Le)\n\nZ - Thorin Oakenshield\n\nAA - Elrond\n\nAB - Bard the Bowman\n\nAC - Beregond\n\nAD - Merry"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=860070","commentId":860070,"userName":"ana4","timestamp":1378554934,"content":"Ok, I will step in for this round.

Besides, I'm uber stoked for all these new Hobbits!  Out with the old, in with the new!)\n\nS - Aragorn (Le) - (I wanna love Imrahil more than I do... but seriously, it's Aragorn.  Although Imrahil's artwork nearly earned an upset pick here for me)\n\nT - Faramir - (chants:  Fara-Mir!  Fara-mir!  Fara-mir!   Fara-mir!  Fara-meeeeeeeeeeeeeeer!!!!)\n\nU - Legolas - (Elf-on-Elf violence.  Not exactly the kin-slaying here, but still nothing anyone wants to see... Plus Legolas avenges Gloin's... my favorite hero art... loss to Elrohir)\n\nV - Hama - (Now that I've long ago broken my \"Eowyn-Habit\", I can't go back to her now.  Too risky, now that I've been sober for the better part of a year)\n\nW - Dain - (Nori's win over Dwalin in the first round was a nod to the better threat-reduction mechanic...  But all non-Gimli Dwarves must bow before the uber-king!)\n\nX - Sam Gamgee - (Like Caleb Grace reiterating Tolkien's thoughts:  You begin to realize that the main hero of the story gradually shifts from being Frodo... to being Sam.)\n\nY - Boromir (Le) - (Hardest vote for me in this round.  Bifur really should have earned my nostalgia vote, since I probably ran him 40% of all my games early on.  But a \"double-Boromir-upset\" in round two??  Too much to ask for!)\n\nZ - Denethor - (gave Denethor my \"superior theme\" nod for round one. Thorin gets the nod over him this round for the same reason.)\n\nAA - Glorfindel - (Glorfindel gets my \"blindly biased\" vote this round for two reasons:  1)  I don't give a **** that Elrond is the better hero... I WANT AN ALL-GLORFINDEL FINAL; and 2) Never been a big Elrond.. the character... fan in the first place.  3)  Glorfindel spanked the Witch King... and Balrogs in his earlier incarnation- cue canon purist arguments now; and 4)  I'm apparently not good at math!)\n\nAB - Bard the Bowman - (actually wanted to vote for Frodo as a 4th Hobbit to set up the possibility of an all-hobbit \"Final Four\", but since he and Merry are both in this bottom division together, it couldn't happen.  So this is where I'll give my \"artwork\" vote of the round to Bard. Seriously, Magili has me torn... Half the time I think the art is too \"pretty\", and even non-elves look like elves.  Then you have those cards that you just sit back and \"****\"... Bard is that moment for me.  He and Gloin are currently my favorite hero artworks.  Although the new hobbits may end up growing on me to pass them....)\n\nAC - Theodred  - (\"Make that money\" over \"Save that Money\"... and I used Theodred so much early on in this game.... had to give him my nostalgia vote this round)\n\nAD - Merry - (Another tough call, as Balin's ability is great.  But Merry's artwork is just fantastic!  And his readying ability for extra attacks???  Just sick!  I am SOOOO pumped to see the inevitable new Eowyn Tactics hero and how she and this Merry will produce amazing combos!)"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=860246","commentId":860246,"userName":"Samwise Gamgee","timestamp":1378572465,"content":"Count updated.

And Nori still has that beer...\"\n\nAlso, some fans are less fans of Nori than unwilling to support Dain.\n\nAna said, \"This got me into it, I really want Dáin to lose this one, even before he finally gets his errata, one of the worst designs out there.\"\n\nTeamjimby is trying to strike a balance, \"I refuse to play Dain because he's OP. Nori is one of my favorite Dwarves, too.\"\n\nNori was overwhelmed by the support. He added, \"I was just happy to get past Dwalin and I thought it was the end of the mine... I mean line... when I was matched up with Dain. I'd like to point out that Dain was not one of the company that went back to the Lonely Mountain. And threat reduction... is... AWESOME! Anyways, after this is all over, no matter how it turns out, we should all go get a beer!\"\n\nDain the King took time from his rule to say, \"I don't know why there are so many... \"haters\" I believe is the term? Yes, haters. As king, I have a great responsibility to support all Dwarrows. You all may be critical of me now that we are living in relative peace, but when a real hard quest comes along, you will all turn to your king!\"\n\nffg_nori-ohauh.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_nori-ohauh.jpg] vs ffg_dain-ironfoot-rtm.jpg [http://www.cardgamedb.com/forums/uploads/lotr/ffg_dain-ironfoot-rtm.jpg]\n\nEdited September 7, 2013 by Samwise Gamgee"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=860247","commentId":860247,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1378572573,"content":">  \n> \n> Glorfindel (Lore) responded, \"I really have to thank benhanses and all the others who voted for me.

They were both facing off against dwarves. All other dwarves fell to there non-dwarf opponents.\n\n \n\nMerry and Sam were the only hobbits to advance. Biblo, Frodo, Fatty and both Pippins will have to cheer them on from the sidelines.\n\n \n\nFinally, what proved to be the biggest upset, Faramir slew Beorn in an epic contest.

ALL HAIL THE KING!   A-LO's ability is just too good, especially when he really made it so much easier for everyone to unchain themselves from the threat-reduction of Spirit.  He's one of those rare characters that breaks the sphere-mold.  Boromir epitomizes the best of Tactics.  Aragorn just ignores sphere dependency all together.  Besides, I had to have ONE Aragorn make it through this round.\n\n \n\nBecause.....\n\n \n\nAG - FARAMIR!  FARAMIR!  FARAMIR!   FAR.  A.  MEEEEEEEEEEEEEER!!!!! \n\n \n\n(as for an actual semit-rational explanation... This is a vote of heart for me.  In case anyone hasn't read any of my other blurbs in the previous rounds, Faramir is my guy.  Plain and simple.  If Eru Iluvator himself were in this competition against Faramir... I'd kick open the Door of Night myself and jump into the void with Melkor rather than vote against Faramir.)\n\n \n\nAH - Legolas.  Legolas just keeps getting better as this game goes on with every new ranged combo they throw out there.  And as strong as Gimli and Boromir are, Legolas is the TRUE star of Tactics, as the only real option for \"bow-questing\" in that sphere.  And quite bluntly, I didn't vote for Eowyn the last round either.  While she was the Spirit poster-child when this game started, Spirit has out-grown her.  Just because she's pretty and has huge..... will-power, I'm not gonna let that distract me!   There is so much more to the sphere now, without getting away from its roots as being the questing king.  I can't vote for Eowyn, who isn't even the best Spirit hero (Glorfindel and Frodo are vastly superior), over Legolas, arguably the best Tactics hero.\n\n \n\nAI - Sam Gamgee - To a lesser degree, this is also a heart vote.  But since Tolkien pretty much said that the LOTR really becomes a story about Sam as the hero, even over Frodo, I'm gonna have to side with the Master and pick Sam.  I've definitely gotten my fair share of wins with Dain at the helm of the dwarven-horde ship, but my nostalgia with this OP hero cannot surpass my affection for the best hero in the books!  And Sam is also getting my \"super-excited-for-the-Black-Riders-and-I-wanna-play-Hobbits-RIGHT-NOW\" vote.\n\n \n\nAJ - Boromir (Le).  I really haven't used either of these too much, although Denethor has helped me out in a pinch from time to time.  But the truth is that BoLe hasn't yet reached his potential, as FFG kinda misled us into thinking they were gonna build an impressive Gondorian machine around him.  And while he's seen some nice allies dropped in around him, his true potential as a Gondorian leader is ahead of him, I believe....  When it comes down to it, I had to vote son over father because I wanted at least one Boromir to continue on.\n\n \n\nAK - Elrond.  I so wanted to vote Bard here.  I thought of using my \"artwork vote\" for this round to justify picking him.  But I can't.  I love Bard's ability (once unleashed by the ranged support cards), but Elrond is just too **** overwhelming.  Even before you add his ring and a little Stargazing to make him a juggernaut.  You want to double up all your healing?  You got it.  You wanna ignore sphere payment loyalties for any ally you want?  Done.....  He even LOOKS overwhelming on his card, standing there all smug-like with his arms crossed, with a glorious landscape backdropped behind him.  Does it look like he's intimidated AT ALL by Bard drawing an arrow out of his quiver??  No.  He does not.  I hate that he's such an arrogant SOB.  But I yield to his sheer awesomeness.\n\n \n\nAL - Merry.  That is all.\n\nEdited September 9, 2013 by benhanses"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/89803-the-hero-championship/?do=findComment&comment=861477","commentId":861477,"userName":"Mr Coffee","timestamp":1378746760,"content":"No, really though....
