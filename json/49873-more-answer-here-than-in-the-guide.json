Dunhere is special in that when it is your chance to attack you can attack enemies in staging (those that aren't engaged with any player) and he gets +1 attack when he does. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49873-more-answer-here-than-in-the-guide/?do=findComment&comment=499143","commentId":499143,"userName":"reno1051","timestamp":1310545569,"content":"are you asking if you put gandalf back in your hand or sneak attack back in your hand?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49873-more-answer-here-than-in-the-guide/?do=findComment&comment=499259","commentId":499259,"userName":"servant of the secret fire","timestamp":1310560986,"content":"kjorn said:\n\n \n\ni just finish the second quest with:  Aragorn/Galadriel/Bereavor  : was piece of cake.  I use sneak attack with gandalf so that was easy to kill the troll.  That's why i ask my first question.\n\n\n\nGaladriel???"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49873-more-answer-here-than-in-the-guide/?do=findComment&comment=499854","commentId":499854,"userName":"Kjorn2","timestamp":1310670220,"content":"For dunhere, you mean i can attack ennemies who are still in the staging area and not attacking me is this right? \n\n \n\nsorry for galadriel. i mean eowyn... i alway call her galadriel because she look like her :-)))\n\n \n\nfor the sneak attack with gandalf i say i call gandal with my sneak attack and after the round i put it back in my hand where i can bring it back later instead of putting it away in the discard pile.\n\n \n\nanother question.  About the ability of Denethor.  I was arguing with a friend about his ability.  If i follow his action : Exhaust denethor to look at the top card of the encounter deck.  you may move that card to the bottom of the deck.  this action doesn't specify to put another card in place.  So does that mean with Denetor, each beginning of the phase if i use his ability i'll never bring another card in the staging area?  If so, with him it's almost each time a winning situation.  Seem kind of easy."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/49873-more-answer-here-than-in-the-guide/?do=findComment&comment=499861","commentId":499861,"userName":"Sylvicolus","timestamp":1310670717,"content":"Yes, you can use Dunhere during the combat phase to attack one enemy in the staging area.\n\nWith Sneak Attack, Gandalf returns to your hand at the end of the PHASE, not the end of the turn.\n\nWith Denethor, you can look at the top card and keep it on the top or put it on the bottom. But regardless you must still draw an encounter card when the game requires it, such as during the Quest Phase."}]}
