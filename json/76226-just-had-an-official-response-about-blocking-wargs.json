Change the way how internal play testing works or hire more play testers or release beta version to exclusive members before actual product……\n\nI mean, I won't even mind waiting extra few weeks (or a month or two), if that will help improve overall quality of the game.\nBetter delayed to perfection than rushed goods."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76226-just-had-an-official-response-about-blocking-wargs/?do=findComment&comment=739246","commentId":739246,"userName":"richsabre","timestamp":1356540280,"content":"as much as i agree more play testing is needed i really dont think ffg can afford to go any slower with this game's releases\n\nrich"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76226-just-had-an-official-response-about-blocking-wargs/?do=findComment&comment=739274","commentId":739274,"userName":"just Logan","timestamp":1356544478,"content":"Sorry, is this a question about a card from HoN? Could you reference the text, I'm stil waiting for it to get here and could find no \"Blocking Wargs\" card. The math I see seems off 4/35 is 11.5%  or so .Do you have to clear the deck? Is the issue with the resolve the when revealed then sugre ruling? That always seemes weird, could it be solved if you went sugre, then when revaeled? Would that break other cards?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76226-just-had-an-official-response-about-blocking-wargs/?do=findComment&comment=739383","commentId":739383,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1356571901,"content":"Weird. Why does \"reset\" somehow sound like  \"loose\" to me?\n\n \n\nHowever, there are some cards that are able to influence the encounter deck so that a player does not have to \"reset\" the game."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/76226-just-had-an-official-response-about-blocking-wargs/?do=findComment&comment=739543","commentId":739543,"userName":"13edl@m","timestamp":1356613431,"content":"I can see why people might get peeved if it happened to them.  So far our play group has played II a few times and have lost to it without the blocking warg reset.  I actually like the challenge of it, and have thought of a few different ways to tackle the varied needs of the scenario.  But honestly I'm not very inclined to fear the blocking warg infinite loop. \n\nSince we play four player we splash spirit in to get anywhere between three to six test of wills.(Though not everyone has three base sets to work with) . The silver bullet for this problem is Eleanor though.  I know people don't like to play her and think she's sub par statwise, but in a four player game your probably going to run into at least one treachery a round.  If you go to LOTRLCG, and go to the compare section you can see the various percentages pertaining to different card types.  The treachery content ranges anywhere from 19%(passage through mirkwood) to 51%(flight from moria) Eleanor will be worth it if your getting hosed by treacheries.  We used her for the majority of dwarrowdelf and always felt she was as crucial as Eowyn in multiplayer games. \n\nWe generally have smooth sailing when she's around and if your worried about the lady of Gondor being idle in some situations I suggest using the cards strength of will and common cause to put her to use."}]}
