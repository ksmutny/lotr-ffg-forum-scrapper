I drew this card with my Tactics/Lore deck, and had exactly 5 characters to exhaust, so it all went well and good. But the question occurred to me: can you exhaust cards from two separate players to pay for \"exhaust X amount of characters\" requirements? Like for Peace and Thought, Hail of Stones and cards like that? Thanks!\n\nEdited January 25, 2014 by Chris51261"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97805-hail-of-stones/?do=findComment&comment=964599","commentId":964599,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1390695768,"content":"As it doesn't specifically say that you're limited to your own characters, it should be possible (might piss off your partner though)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97805-hail-of-stones/?do=findComment&comment=964662","commentId":964662,"userName":"GrandSpleen","timestamp":1390702029,"content":"It's considered a \"cost\" when the card is written as \"Do X to do Y.\"  X is the cost.  You have to use your own resources (meaning resource tokens, cards in your hand, characters under your control) to pay costs."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97805-hail-of-stones/?do=findComment&comment=964826","commentId":964826,"userName":"leptokurt","timestamp":1390724036,"content":"> It's considered a \"cost\" when the card is written as \"Do X to do Y.\"  X is the cost.  You have to use your own resources (meaning resource tokens, cards in your hand, characters under your control) to pay costs.\n\nAh, you're correct. It's even in the rulebook (p. 25)! (not that it makes any sense thematically)\n\nEdited January 26, 2014 by leptokurt"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/97805-hail-of-stones/?do=findComment&comment=965083","commentId":965083,"userName":"Chris51261","timestamp":1390762160,"content":"Thanks!
