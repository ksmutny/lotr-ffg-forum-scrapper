Also It's kinda a stretch to say that its not for professional players seeing as there are no professional players.  No one (at least I assume no one) plays this game for their livelihood or as a means to earn some serious money.  So we can't really say anything about professional players at this point in time because their are none.  Is this podcast for everyone?  No probably not but for something that these guys do for free and with no gain to themselves I would say its an amazing thing.  Anyways to each their own.  As for me I will continue listening to Brandon talk about putting 5 unexpected courages on Boromir.  :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png]"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53414-cardboard-of-the-rings-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=568835","commentId":568835,"userName":"TheLightdarker","timestamp":1324177853,"content":"Welp, the podcast may not be any good, but at least they give away free Adventure Packs! lengua.gif [/edge_scripts/fckeditor/editor/images/smiley/msn/lengua.gif]\n\nIn all seriousness though, love or hate the show, when it comes to describing the appeal, value, or personality of our podcast, this is how I perceive each host's individual contribution:\n\n- Brandon brings an extraordinary amount of enthusiasm for this game, the Lord of the Rings franchise, and gaming in general to the show, and really brings it to life through sheer energy and excitement for each and every release in this series.  He does make some assumptions and snap judgment calls (i.e., calling cards \"unplayable\"), but he is far from the first player in any gaming community to do this.  I think his goal is primarily to enjoy the game as a thematically immersing, entertaining, and at times challenging gaming experience, and if part of that is having a less than rote memorization of the rules, then so be it.  This community has all kinds of players, and I think that Brandon represents a tremendous portion of them.\n\n- Andrew has been Brandon's friend for a long, long time, and their personalities complement one another very well, providing (in my opinion), great comedic relief.  Andrew is certainly familiar with the Lord of the Rings series, but not so committed to either the franchise or the game as Brandon.  A little more \"casual,\" perhaps, but as the busiest of all of the hosts (full-time job, married with a new baby, etc), he certainly represents a significant portion of the player-base as well - people that quite simply don't have the time to dedicate to getting all of the rules absolutely perfect, but who still want to enjoy the game, both with their friends and alone, and to make the most of their experience while doing so.\n\n- Brian is a relatively casual player, but someone whom is nevertheless passionate about the Lord of the Rings franchise and views the game from a primarily solo player perspective.  He is willing at times to modify the rules for the sake of creating a more engaging, enjoyable or \"fair\" experience (e.g., house rules), and while some players may not necessarily agree with this approach, there are certainly those that do, as well.  Along with Brandon, he is very comfortable discussing the lore or flavor aspects of the game, and overall I feel is as solid a contribution to the cast as any other host.\n\n- Finally, Mitch (yours truly), approaches the card game as someone who is admittedly more interested in the mechanics of the game than the LOTR theme itself.  When I first started listening to the show, I was as surprised as anyone about the misinterpretation of a few cards by Brandon and Andrew that seemed to me to be fairly straight-forward (i.e., Steward of Gondor, Eleanor), but that did absolutely nothing to stop me from becoming a huge fan of this podcast, as hearing people so enthusiastically discuss the game I even now continue to enjoy so much made it a far more satisfying and engaging experience for me when each new Adventure Pack or preview article was released by FFG.  It's hard to say if I would be nearly as interested in this game if it weren't for the existence of the COTR podcast, but I certainly have Brandon and Andrew to thank for inspiring me to new heights of interest and enthusiasm in not only the card game itself, but really, the LOTR franchise as a whole.  I probably pay closer attention to detail in this game than the other hosts (i.e. rules, card interactions and memorization), but even when we're recording a show and someone says something that I think is a poor decision, or maybe even plain wrong, I don't always feel the need to interject, simply because I believe everyone should be entitled to their own opinion, and it would detract from the overall quality of the podcast if I, or anyone, kept consistently interrupting people to adamantly assert my or their own \"correct\" thoughts.\n\nOut of all of the hosts, I would probably be the most likely to attempt to participate should there ever become a LOTR LCG tournament scene, but until then, I hardly think that it's a matter of life or death for this podcast to get each and every ruling and card interaction absolutely accurate (even if I would honestly prefer it did).  Not everyone would agree, of course, which in turn brings me to my next point.\n\nTo respond directly to Glaurung, whom called us dilettantes, I don't think for a moment that Brandon's initial idea for COTR was to cater primarily to the ultimate tournament gamer or rules lawyer, and when I joined the show, by no means did I want to alter that structure he had established and was satisfied with.  Rather, I believe his idea and inspiration was from the beginning to foster a sense of excitement for, and to facilitate discussion of, this new game in a franchise that he has always loved - need I remind you that he actually wears a \"One Ring?\"  It has unfortunately become very clear since the inception of the podcast that Brandon and the rest of us cannot please everybody, but really, all that we can try to do is to put together a show that we all very much enjoy creating once every two weeks, and for each of us to provide our own unique contribution as I laid out above.  We present it to the community to either accept or reject it as they will, but despite having received feedback similar to yours in the past, I am still not convinced that I should try to persuade the rest of the hosts to approach this game in a way other than that which they have already been doing for so long - that which they have grown to enjoy as a way of spending a significant amount of their free time.\n\nI have often thought of myself as being very similar to you, Glaurung, and will freely admit that I have often empathized and agreed with you when you have made (and continue make), controversial or inflammatory claims such as \"this game is too easy,\" which so often tends to illicit frustration and ire from the rest of the community.  However, as much as I hate to get drawn into any pointless debate or forum flaming, I just have to say (as so many others have before me), that the majority of your posts about this game that you somehow still claim to enjoy (and all things related), are consistently, astonishingly negative.  You mentioned that there's nothing \"for you\" in the COTR podcast (which is fine, as anyone is certainly entitled to think whatever they would like about it), but quite frankly, considering your very outspoken opinions of this game, I don't really understand what there is in the LOTR LCG itself for you.  You are welcome to have your own opinion about the podcast, of course, but truthfully, if you think that the primary goal of the other three hosts of COTR is to understand each and every rule and interaction of this cooperative, non-competitive, non-tournament game perfectly, above simply having fun playing a cool game and talking about it, then you're unfortunately missing the point.  I believe that the show has indeed become more analytical than it once was since I joined the podcast, but for me to do more than I already do to \"correct\" the opinions of any of my co-hosts would, I feel, do nothing but to detract from the fun they have creating this podcast, and in turn, playing the game itself.\n\nI'm not trying to get into a flame war with you, but if you honestly believe that this game is ever going to become as \"competitive\" in the tournament scene as the likes of Magic: the Gathering, then I think, unfortunately, that you are sadly mistaken, and to call COTR dilettantes or desultory is, I believe, not entirely accurate, and indeed, unnecessarily inflammatory.  Would I approach this podcast differently, if it were mine exclusively?  I daresay I would - but it has been Brandon's creation from the beginning, and essentially nonconstructive criticism does little more than discourage the hosts and listeners alike from participating in COTR, and perhaps even our game itself.\n\nDoes it make me cringe a little bit , for example, when Brandon declares a potentially useful card \"unplayable?\"   It certainly does - but I'm okay with that.  I accept COTR for what it is - an imperfect creation (much like LOTR LCG) - but that does not stop me from enjoying it immensely, and always looking forward to producing our next episode."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/53414-cardboard-of-the-rings-podcast/?do=findComment&comment=568843","commentId":568843,"userName":"Glaurung","timestamp":1324182252,"content":"Dont be angry my friend.
