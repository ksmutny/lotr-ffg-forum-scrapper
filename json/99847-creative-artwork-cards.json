Working the templates with Photoshop\n\n     - insert the image -there are webs with lots of image arts like deviantart, tumbler, .... searching in google-;\n\n     - add the text you have thought...\n\n     - and -important i think- reduce the size of the template to 500px minimum\n\n3. Upload the image to a server (for example, imageshak)\n\n4. Include the image in your post, by the key 'Image' (insert in the url text the image link that you got in the server in point 3).\n\n \n\n      drfi.jpg [http://imageshack.com/a/img41/9710/drfi.jpg]\n\nEdited February 25, 2014 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=992530","commentId":992530,"userName":"danpoage","timestamp":1393088215,"content":"I like the pipe.

It's \"to\", meaning that he needs to be exhausted to trigger his ability. His willpower is not spectacular, and if you happen to commit him to quest and fail to deliver enough progress tokens to the active location - you'll find yourself in a bad situation. The main limiting factor here is locations and your ability to explore them. Thus, leading us to a rich combo potential. Example:\n\nPlayer quests successfully, with Smeagol being committed to the quest, and gets enough progress to explore active location, readying Smeagol and drawing a card as the result. Then, during the combat phase Smeagol exhausts to attack and Spirfindel exhausts his Asfaloth to epxlore another location currently in staging area(or a new active, doesn't matters), readying Smeagol for another attack and giving himself a card. \n\n \n\nAs for Imrahil - a character leaving game is not always a penalty.

If you're underwhelmed by his high attack value - I see it coming from unexpected and sudden assaults rather from brute force. That's the thematic reasoning.\n\n \n\nThe gameplay reasoning is Spirit sphere lacks decent fighters. We have a whole bunch of whopping 1 attackers, and a few higher than 1 ones.

I wanted to do something new. Something that would be especially good for Gandalf. Adding 4 defense to a character is a huge boost, but it comes at the cost of exhausting Gandalf. This isn't a huge deal since you are likely using the Hobbit Gandalf if you're using this card, so you can still quest (since he doesn't exhaust to quest), and if you end up not needing Gandalf to help with defending, he is then available to lend his 4 attack to help destroy enemies.\n\n \n\nThis card essentially just makes Gandalf more versatile by giving the option to allow Gandalf to help with defending, rather than by defending alone. This can make Gandalf a very powerful card in Hobbit decks where you have Frodo as the defender, but you want to keep your threat within secrecy range, so you give Frodo more defense so he receives less damage.\n\n \n\nAlso note that the defense boost lasts until the end of the phase, so if the defender has readying effects, he has the boost for multiple attacks.\n\n \n\n-----\n\n \n\nIn case the image fails to load, here's the card as text:\n\n \n\nCost: 1\nNeutral Attachment\n\nMount.

I just don't feel that having a character with 4 base willpower belongs in the Tactics sphere. Sure Tactics could use some help in the questing department, but Theoden (boosted to 3WP) + 4WP Tactics Eowyn (boosted to 5WP) + any other 2WP Tactics hero (boosted to 3WP) or any 3WP hero would be a higher starting willpower than any other combination of heroes currently available in the game.

Anborn - I know there's an ally version of Anborn already, but he seems to be ready-made to have a hero version as well. Someone else (Feonix, maybe?) had created an Anborn hero with Spirit as his sphere of influence, but I HATED WITH A PASSION the artwork they chose for him. They used some concept artwork from Diablo II or Diablo III, I can't remember . . . and it was totally wrong for the vibe of the LOTR LCG. Plus, the special power they'd given him was basically identical to Asfaloth, and I didn't think it was very cool to duplicate player card effects using a hero. \n\n \n\nSo, I wanted to revamp him into something I liked. \n\n \n\nanborn-hero-sm.png [https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-t3nu6rHc3hY/UycTNGlOQfI/AAAAAAAAANg/S9TJGY3Qvq4/w300-h422-no/anborn-hero-sm.png]\n\n \n\n \n\nThe idea behind this is similar to Erkenbrand, where it adds a little bit of flexibility for Gondorian Spearmen and Rammas Defenders in those dire cases where you just need to get an active location completed. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n2. Stuff for Elladan and Elrohir\n\n \n\nThe twins are by far my favorite characters in this game. I love the concept of the synergies they generate for each other, plus the fact that simply put, they have the ability to \"break\" the action economy right out of the gate through the use of resources. \n\n \n\nHowever, I'm tired of having a thematically inappropriate reason to keep adding Steward of Gondor to my decks (because Elrohir + Steward of Gondor = Amazing Defender).\n\n \n\nSo I came up with a couple of item concepts for them.\n\n \n\ngondolin-shield-sm.png [https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-I8Ek10uzu-E/UycTNIAFVwI/AAAAAAAAANY/wtKMN-yGBsM/w300-h422-no/gondolin-shield-sm.png]\n\n \n\n \n\nout-upon-errantry-sm.png [https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-CUK3VYepGCc/UycTN0imdVI/AAAAAAAAANs/VZFOTNsy8rM/w300-h422-no/out-upon-errantry-sm.png]\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nI thought long and hard about adding the \"increase threat to ready\" feature of Out Upon Errantry, simply because I felt it could easily be abused with Beravor. But then I realized, that the either/or nature of the card means you're never getting an extra resource, AND getting to ready a Dunedain or Ranger character. I could theoretically see the argument to increase the threat cost for readying to 2, but to me I think the card's \"power level\" is just about right as is, at least compared to its closest analogue, Steward of Gondor. \n\n \n\nThe shield was really just an excuse to stop stuffing Gondorian Shield into my decks (because once again, Elrohir + Steward of Gondor + Gondorian Shield = UBER!!!). Plus, I think the threat cancellation effect for Orcs and Mordor enemies is pretty thematically appropriate. Yeah, it sort of makes Burning Brand obsolete, but I like the fact that it requires spending a token to use as a balancing effect. \n\nEdited March 17, 2014 by FeloniusBard"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1015567","commentId":1015567,"userName":"FeloniusBard","timestamp":1395072547,"content":"One more entry: \n\n \n\nOkay, seriously . . . we HAVE to have some kind of condition-remover that ISN'T A STINKING DWARF CARD (or requires the VoI expansion). \n\n \n\nSo here's mine.

Having played an Elladan/Elrohir/Loragorn deck almost exclusively for about 4 months now, I'm finally realizing that it's just a nearly impossible combo to play properly. I really like the concept I've created for Lore Elrohir, I think I'd almost permanently change him out for Leadership Elrohir. But I just can't wrap my head around a good concept for Spirit Elladan. \n\n \n\nThis idea was to keep the basic \"flavor\" of his original mechanic, where he pays resources to activate additional actions. But the use case of readying following a treachery is not as universal as the original Elladan multiple-attack synergy. So I added the condition cancellation as a secondary effect. But I'm not sure I'm happy with either. \n\n \n\nWhat's are some good, thematic, balanced abilities that could be used with Spirit Elladan? "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1100894","commentId":1100894,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1401304543,"content":"Faramir: maybe add another kind of limitation like discard an ally in play to...

Too dificult to reach the good effect of his ability. Isn'?\n\nElladan: not bad, good abilities. Why not?\n\nEdited May 28, 2014 by Mndela"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1101196","commentId":1101196,"userName":"FeloniusBard","timestamp":1401321145,"content":"For Faramir, the idea was that I wanted it to be a major \"game changing\" ability, similar to Lore Aragorn. You get to do it once, but it's a significant, dramatic effect. I thought of changing it to read \"All characters\" instead of \"All heroes.\" Late in the game, it could become a huge game-changer. \n\n \n\nThe other option is to leave it as \"All heroes,\" but add an additional cost.\n\n \n\nFor example: \n\n 1. \"Spend 2 resources from Faramir's resource pool\"\n 2. \"Discard 2 cards from the Spirit Sphere of Influence from your hand.\n\nThen change the usage limit to \"Once per quest stage\" (i.e., once for stage 1b, once for 2b, once for 3b, etc.).\n\n \n\nThinking about it, I like the \"Discard 2 Spirit cards from your hand\" to activate the effect. It makes a nice either / or decision for the player. \n\n \n\nAll in all though, I like the basic concept for Spirit Faramir vastly better than the original. It's way more thematically appropriate, since in the books his very presence in battle inspired his followers. \n\n \n\nThe more I thought about Elladan, the more I think you're right; it seems like a decent set of abilities. His readying ability also makes a great synergy with Eleanor. \n\n \n\nFor Elrohir you think his ability is a little bit UNDER-powered? Hmmm. That's interesting.\n\n \n\nAgain, the idea from the original twins was that they get to spend resource tokens to gain additional circumstantial actions. \n\n \n\nMaybe something like, \"Refresh Action: If Elrohir defended an attack this round, pay a resource token from his resource pool to draw an additional card. Pay an additional token for each point of damage on Elrohir to activate this effect.\" \n\n \n\nThat way if he does take damage during combat, you have an action window to heal him first. This also synergizes nicely with healing cards like Nimrodel, Warden of Healing, Self-preservation, etc. Yes, actually, that's way more elegant, and easy to understand. \n\nEdited May 28, 2014 by FeloniusBard"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1101495","commentId":1101495,"userName":"ZanzibarLand","timestamp":1401344998,"content":"What is the shieldarm supposed to do?

There are a lot of cards that already exist that might not get used, or are used sparingly due to their low stats.

Even Imladris Stargazer. Sometimes you're already set and don't need to look at or rearrange your top cards since you just did it last turn. This gives her more purpose. Minas Tirith Lampwright is another great example. He sits around doing nothing until a card with surge pops up. Now he can do more than that when nothing shows up.

My version is more thematic because if questing goes wrong, you lose willpower instead of hit points. Denethor lost his will and courage, not his physical health, from using a Palantir. You can also boost your willpower with Favor of the Lady, Dunedain Quest, Celebrian's Stone, and Sword that was Broken. This can give you a huge willpower pool, essentially making it so that the hero is guaranteed not to die. In either case, if you attach this to a hero with at least 3 willpower, the likeliness of the hero dying in a fame is probably pretty close to the same.\n\n \n\nNow, let's compare this card to Light of Valinor, which is probably its closest match.\n\n \n\nBoth Unique, both cost 1 and both have the same positive effect. The Noble keyword is far more common than Noldor or Silvan on heroes (more 3x as many Noble heroes), which gives the Palantir the upper hand. The palantir is also neutral, which once again makes it better. The \"restricted\" keyword is a good way to add balance, though it's not extremely painful because questers don't tend to get many other restricted attachments anyway. Then, of course, it's forced effect gives it the potential to be far worse than Light of Valinor, but considering its passive ability, there's a decent chance this negative effect will ever rear its head, especially combined with Light of Valinor on another hero.\n\n \n\nIf you use both cards, you can easily get 6+ willpower each quest phase for \"free\", which makes it pretty easy to avoid this negative effect. This makes me think that having the -2 willpower effect is more balanced than the damaging effect, but moreso, I just don't think we should have any more attachments that allow you to quest for free.\n\n \n\nI know I got a bit nitpicky here. I hope no one takes it personally.

What's the point of having Eowyn ready outside of most of the quests?\n\n\n\nI'm talking about a permanent willpower loss, like the Denethor ally. How is that not thematic? You said that when they fail, \"Palantir starts to consume the hero.\" Look at Denethor. When he was \"consumed\", he no longer had the will to fight. His willpower then went so low that he even lost the will to live and tried to kill himself. I'm trying to represent that. I know this isn't the Palantir from Minas Tirith, but I don't know of any other stories that can tell anything about the negative effects of using the Palantir.\n\n \n\nAlso, most \"jack-of-all-trades\" Noble heroes can get 3+ willpower pretty easily with any of the attachments I already mentioned or from factional boosts, which would save them from dying from the first failed quest. Also, they now quest for less, so the Palantir's effect is weaker, which is a stronger downside than taking damage because damage can be healed and the loss of willpower cannot and the cards \"good\" effect is only useful if you have a lot of willpower.\n\n \n\nI totally agree that Eowyn isn't a good target for this card. I never mentioned her name, did I? How about these guys who either have 3 willpower from the start or have thematic ways to raise it to 3+ (not using Favor of the Lady or Dunedain Quest):\n\n \n\nStart with 3\n\nCeleborn\n\nElrond\n\nGlorfindel\n\nThorin\n\nTheoden\n\n \n\nStart with 2\n\nAragorn: Celebrian's Stone and/or Sword that was Broken\n\nFaramir: Visionary Leadership\n\nGimli: Dain Ironfoot\n\nGloin: Dain Ironfoot\n\nPrince Imrahil: Visionary Leadership\n\n \n\nWith the exceptions of Elladan, Elrohir, Eowyn, every Noble hero with 2 or more starting willpower can thematically get 3+ willpower and be useful in at least 1 aspect of combat. Even Elladan and Elrohir can be good targets with Favor of the Lady, Dunedain Quest, or if you're happy with the 2 willpower, by just not failing a quest.\n\n \n\nI don't want to get into a heated debate with the most notorious troll on this forum.

If you ever plan on using him as a defender, which is to be expected given his 3 defense, he's in too great danger, not to mention that a single of those treacheries that damage exhausted characters is going to kill him right away. I like the idea of scrying the encounter deck for a proggressive cost based on the hero's willpower, that is cool, but it's a little too dangerous to attach to any hero with less than 3 willpower. Especially jacks of all trades who will defend or take damage eventually. An easy way to fix it without changing the ability much would be to just ditch the effect of discarding the hero if he gets 0 WP, and just stick with the cost of losing willpower and the threat gain. And finally, did you not like art I gave you? Was it too small? I like the one you used, but seeing that the guy behind is clearly a wizard, maybe it's more suitable for the Palantir of Orthanc.\n\nEdited September 6, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1251530","commentId":1251530,"userName":"MyNeighbourTrololo","timestamp":1410035275,"content":"Yes, your the art you provided looks extremely wierd on the cards to me for some reason (maybe just form is not fit).\n\n \n\nThe second palantir is about giving another use to willpower outside of questing.

Does this look too weird? I'm actually planning on having these cards professionally printed, so any feedback is welcome. I must say I still don't quite like the part about discarding the hero if he gets to 0 willpower. It's a bit too harsh IMO to have the willpower become the new hitpoints, especially if the hero has less than 3 willpower. I think that cutting that line and just leaving the Palantir totally useless (since you cannot look at any cards if the WP is 0, and reducing the willpower for each point of damage) is enough drawback, besides of course the threat and damage whenever you reveal an enemy card.\n\nEdited September 6, 2014 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1251800","commentId":1251800,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1410054116,"content":">  \n> \n> > I don't want to get into a heated debate with the most notorious troll on this forum.

Now, not to praise my custom card, but I want to say I really like how the art looks on the card. It's not the medium necessarily, but the style. I really like the rather simple decorations and ornaments. The base of the Palantir is just some leaves, and the little mantle is decorated with triangles and flowers. Not to mention the great use of color and lighting. But my point is that you can make beautiful \"elven\" looking decorations without using the now typical interlaced vines and flowing lines such as the ones in the structure in the background of the Galadriel hero, or the very borders of our own player cards, a style which arguably started with the LOTR movies. The only \"canon\" source of this style is the trees seen on the Doors of Durin, but if you look at past (before the movies) artist's interpretation of elven aesthetics as well as the Ralph Bakshi movie, elves are portrayed very differently. For some reason, artists now assume that this is how the \"elven style\" is made, quite unfortunately in my opinion, since in the books there are no detailed descriptions and it's mostly just the interpretation of John Howe mainly, which thanks to the popularity of the movies established itself as the canon of elven aesthetics, ignoring any other possible interpretations (of which there are many before the films, namely in MECCG). Sorry for the little rant, but I'm a little dissapointed that this game's designers and artists take the \"easy route\" and just think that \"Elven\" means interlaced and interwoven lines and vines. And don't get me worng, I think they're beautiful and fit the style of the elves, but people forget that this was mainly popularized by the movies, and there are many other ways you could portray elven decorations and such, not to mention it's getting a little tired IMO."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1257254","commentId":1257254,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1410386426,"content":"> Horn of Gondor will have a field day with this card I just thought up:\n> \n>  \n> \n> Reckless-Vengeance.jpg [https://eoym1q.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2p78wLebcQEZjL2udyIKE3ppSwCIOo2ipMO-77_qS_O31wLXuIDJK91aeaGfpFzWQxemZ-GmMLIK77MNsQd3TZuPM9sdXVCV9IvEq8CUinCfU/Reckless-Vengeance.jpg]\n> \n>  \n> \n> If you can't see it, go to http://1drv.ms/1uvktv3 [http://1drv.ms/1uvktv3]\n\n \n\nit seems an oficial card"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1257907","commentId":1257907,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1410441806,"content":"> it seems an official card\n\nWhat makes you say that?"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1258000","commentId":1258000,"userName":"Mndela","timestamp":1410445118,"content":"I dont know, i only feel like it is a not fanmade card at first sight.\n\n \n\nWell, if icontinue looking at the card, i notice the image is too much realistic, more than normal cards."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1258219","commentId":1258219,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1410452004,"content":"> Reckless-Vengeance.jpg?psid=1 [https://dywpsg.dm2301.livefilestore.com/y2mV1pGVYTkPt6jCFCNA2ZxmLa85r03YRjZTPQi-3M6rGHm5qbQPCra1vdKzXNcXaHucHq46KarB51RwLwWDShN1iH_NMyqae-eEBiuAa5fT0gCCQjUF5q8vafR06lQ1jg3/Reckless-Vengeance.jpg?psid=1]\n> \n> http://1drv.ms/1uvktv3 [http://1drv.ms/1uvktv3]\n\nI'm wondering if 3 damage is too much. Forest Patrol is probably the closest comparison. It costs 1 and requires a Ranger to be in play and the target to be in a trap. This event costs 0, requires an ally to be destroyed by an enemy and costs an additional discarded ally. My event has more \"painful\" costs and requirements, but I believe they're easier to satisfy because they don't require a specific type of deck. Maybe if I just specify that you need to discard a Tactics ally it'll be good.

It doesn't deserve 3 or 4 because it exhausts Gandalf as well, though I wouldn't be too upset at a cost of 3. It is arguably less powerful than Vilya which also costs 2 since it doesn't bring anything into play for free, but it could also be argued that it is more powerful than Vilya, since it gives you access to cards that are no longer generally accessible. They do such different things, though, that it's very difficult to judge. \n\n \n\n> Quickbeam is mega OP.\n\n \n\nI agree. I say that you either need to set the HP to 3 and Def to 2, or get rid of the bonus defense ability, otherwise with some decent healing, you could draw 3 cards per round and have a 6 defense defender, which is pretty ridiculous. At 3 HP and 2 defense base, you can normally draw 2 (3 if you heal and then damage some more) and have a 4 defense defender, which is still pretty darn strong, but still breakable.\n\n \n\nHonestly, though, I think the ability would be best as a response to taking damage rather than as an action to place the damage yourself, especially because just doing the action automatically builds up the Booming Ent as well.\n\n \n\nAs for Gamling... I really don't know what to say.

Songs only cost 1 to give anyone a permanent icon so claiming that it should cost a lot is silly. My point was that the icon does add value to the card and if you get rid of that icon-granting, you help keep Narya more affordable.

I like that you made the \"damage = defense\" part of the action and limiting it to the end of the round instead of making it static, so that you can't just damage him and leave the damage there to be an uber defender forever, but the combo with a decent healer still stands as I mentioned it, though now it is actually stronger.

Yes, I know people like Mndela above would make such a hero with a printed sphere icon, but to me the wizards just have to feel unique and different from the rest of the heroes, and we have hero Gandalf as example to continue the trend and make the whole team. But, it is unlikely that we'll ever have Alatar and Pallando (Saruman or Radagast heroes are more likely), so I decided to make my own wizards and to make them as playable and balanced as possible. Anyway, what I had so far was:\n\n \n\nAlatar, 11, 2, 2, 2, 5   . While Pallando is in play, Alatar gains either the Lore or Spirit resource icon. Alatar's resource icon cannot change.\n\n \n\n \n\nAnd Pallando is the same but with Leadership and Tactics. The final sentence is that basically you choose only one of them and cannot change it with its own ability, though you can add an icon with a song.  Maybe I could have that, plus your suggestion of gaining a resource for Pallando, for example, or drawing a card with Alatar. I'm not convinced by cancelling treacheries. Too many actions and responses would just saturate the card. Wizards need pretty much only one or two big abilities, that are simple yet powerful. I like the passive ability of drawing cards and resources, will use that.\n\nEdited May 31, 2015 by Gizlivadi"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1643439","commentId":1643439,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1433111169,"content":"I didn't mean they were blue in the game.

You have a extra resource that you can use to play anything in his sphere, only condition is Alatar. The spread of stats is not that good, since specialized hero > all around.il\n\n \n\nNo need to talk about Bilbo and Alatar. But Bilbo is not fair game, since he sucks =/\n\n \n\nTheoden only work with specific trait, Rohan, with specific type of card, Allies. His saving grace is that he has arguably better spread of stats, sentinel and +1 threat.\n\n \n\nIf you compare with Elladan and Elrohir, the brothers cost -2 threat, arguably better stats (-1hp, +1atk/def), an ability that has a very costly condition (pay resources to ready) and have less versatility in deck building.\n\n \n\nI think the Wizards are a lot stronger and a lot more versatile, also they can build better decks, since you can choose sphere, get more resources and cards. They need some small nerf in my opinion, some kind of condition in the card draw/resource generation.\n\n \n\nAnyhow, I really like then! The idea is good and almost playable, just need a little bit of less generic awesomeness.\n\nEdited June 1, 2015 by Edvando"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1643702","commentId":1643702,"userName":"DukeWellington","timestamp":1433127601,"content":"I think the first condition on each should say \"setup: if so and so is in play...\" to make it more clear.\n\nI also think you can just add one point on to each of their starting threat levels and they would be balanced.

The thing is that drawing cards is easier than adding resources, so I think at least 10 cards in hand.\n\n \n\nAnyway, Disciple of Alatar has a much better ability then Disciple of Pallando.

I think we can all agree that the disciples are too powerful as they stand, but I disagree that Disciple of Alatar is that much better than Disciple of Pallando. At least in my experience there are shadow effects nowadays that are as bad or even worse than most treacheries. Especially the ones that kill your allies or reduce your action advantage (Attacking enemy makes an additional attack, exhaust a character you control, etc) That's why I thought these 2 abilities somewhat equivalent.\n\n \n\nI really like Ian's suggestion, but if the cost was to discard all cards, etc, it could be very inconsistent, especially if your hand is really small. So how about for Disciple of Alatar: \"Response: Discard 5 cards from your hand to cancel...\" and for Disciple of Pallando: \"Response: Spend 5 resources from Pallando's resource pool to cancel...\"? That way the cost is more consistent. What do you think?

And correct, it should definitely have Victory 1 or something, though that contradicts the Map's final effect.\n\nEdited June 24, 2015 by Olorin93"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1670599","commentId":1670599,"userName":"alogos","timestamp":1435158422,"content":"> Cost 10, Lore, Event\n> \n>  \n> \n> Action: Draw your deck.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n>  \n> \n> Cost 30, Leadership, Event\n> \n>  \n> \n> Can only be played from your hand.\n> \n> Action: Win the game.\n> \n>  \n\n \n\nCost 10, Tactics, Event\n\nDiscard all enemies in play\n\n \n\nCost 10, Spirit, Attachement\n\nAttach to a player threat count, that player can't lose due to threat.\n\n \n\nCost 10, Neutral, unique Ally Manwë\n\n100/100/100/100\n\nManwë is always considered ready\n\nResponse: when Manwë enter play, discard all encounter cards in play.\n\nForced: Discard Manwë at the end of the turn\n\n \n\nThat's easy :D [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_biggrin.png], I miss MTG\n\nEdited June 24, 2015 by alogos"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1670682","commentId":1670682,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1435163645,"content":"Cost 6, Neutral, Ally \n\n \n\nForced: After this ally enters play, discard everything else from play.

Part of the 'cost' of his ability is that you really want to include Mablung and/or hobbits in your team. That limitation to optimal potential teams means he's not inherently overpowered. \n\n \n\nHe only has 4 attack when naked. Throw a dagger or two on him and he's a machine. 4 attack out the gate is better than every single hero but Beorn (and Bard or Tactics Aragorn in a way). I actually don't dislike his attack boost on its own, but it's too much when coupled with his engage ability. \n\n \n\nAnd I simply don't agree with you on the hobbit point. Sam is a wonderful hero that can be augmented to help The Shadow take down tough enemies. And Sam would often ready when the engage ability is used. Merry, SMerry, or Pippin can also be great teammates for The Shadow. \n\n \n\nOf course 1 resource isn't insignificant, but it also isn't a high enough cost for a repeatable feint. Wouldn't you agree that the earliest rounds are the most crucial? When your threat is low and you're trying to build up your forces? That's exactly when The Shadow is at his best. He can ensure that the other two heroes in his team can dedicate themselves to questing and keeping threat low, while he pulls and kills enemies without a fight. \n\n \n\nI don't see how Westfold outrider is a bad example. He has a very similar effect, but at a higher cost: discarding a 2 cost ally. You actually have to draw him and make the choice to sacrifice him for a great effect. I think he's a fine counter example to The Shadow's easy and repeatable action. \n\n \n\nI quite like the idea of a seedier, common scout Hero. Anther scout hero would be nice, and I think the basic concept of an ambusher is promising. And I always love to see custom heroes, because they are so much fun to dissect and discuss (and because I'm a coward who won't share his own concepts). "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1705248","commentId":1705248,"userName":"John Constantine","timestamp":1437987089,"content":"Eomer has 5 attack when \"naked\".\n\n \n\nSam has more starting threat than hobbits usually do, and if you're including him, then there is not much room left for threat reduction.\n\n \n\nIt's not repeatable feint.

All merely for 3 more starting threat.\n\n \n\nI just realized that I've been over-exaggerating the power of The Shadow's engage ability. His ability is still more versatile and reliable (and costly) than that of Tactics Aragorn, who requires quick strike or similar cards to pull enemies out of staging during the quest phase. But then I compared The Shadow to Haldir (one of my favorite heroes) and I see that Haldir's pseudo-feint is in many ways more powerful than The Shadow's. Haldir doesn't need to pay a resource, and he can use his ability to save another player from an attack. Meanwhile, The Shadow is much less useful when paired with high-threat players, who will attract the enemies and eliminate the feint aspect of the Shadow's ability. But I still think his engage ability is very good for single player combat, when engagement is entirely under one person's control. Hama is also worthy of comparison, since he can cycle feint and pay 1 resource each turn, without being required to kill the enemy outright, though with the additional cost of card draw. \n\n \n\nBut even if we were to ignore the usefulness of his ability in combat, The Shadow is wonderful for questing. His ability to remove enemy threat from the staging area is useful for any team. While I completely agree that tactics needs a boost to its questing capabilities, I don't think this is the answer. And it's not as though The Shadow forces you to run mono-tactics. I would gladly pay 1 resource to remove 2-4 threat from the staging area, or to pull a particularly sticky enemy from staging. The Shadow can pull Bill Ferny on turn 1, removing 3 threat from staging and accelerating the removal of a very annoying enemy. I think there needs to be some limitation to his engagement ability. Maybe it can't be used during the quest phase? Maybe it can only be used during X phase?\n\n \n\nI don't mean to imply that he breaks the game or is too powerful to exist, and I'm sorry if I've seemed dismissive so far. It's just that his ability solves a tough problem in a very straightforward, easy way. "},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1706419","commentId":1706419,"userName":"Edvando","timestamp":1438064163,"content":"Hama need to attack, need the card in the discard, you need to also discard a card from hand and pay for the event.\n\n \n\nHaldir is one of the best heroes of the game.

Just considering the HP, only half of the 2-cost Spirit allies have 2 HP, and certainly none of the 1-cost ones (of which, admittedly, there are only three). Plus a Silvan Refugee's worth of willpower as soon as he enters play, plus 1ATK and DEF (none of the 1-cost Spirit allies have any ATK either)? Plus the -1 quest point effect? Barring the need to preserve my last Spirit resource for A Test of Will or something, I'd pretty much autoplay this every time it hit my hand (even knowing that it might be a while before he actually comes under my direct control), which I think makes it a little too powerful. It's really just the constellation of good effects he has.

Similarly this card is quite a good deal for 1 resource but you need to beat the current quest card to reap any benefits. I think perhaps it should only do 2 damage and should not give the quest -1 progress but other than that I think it is well balanced.

I'm still not sure about it, but it's less serious now, I think. And I think he makes perfect sense as a neutral hero. \n\n \n\nAnd how about losing at least the \"draw one card\" stuff? The thematic representation of card draw is usually knowledge, and I don't see how this fits Beorn. Maybe have him spread damage with his big paws, so after he deals any amount of damage to an enemy engaged with you, deal one damage to another enemy (or two? seems strong) engaged with you? I'd prefer damaging more enemies to readying and card draw. Maybe place one damage on one more enemy engaged with you, and if you're engaged with four or more enemies, place another one damage on another enemy engaged with you. I'm seeing him flailing around the battlefield, taking down several orcs with one fell swoop. The more he's surrounded, the angrier and stronger he becomes.\n\nEdited September 4, 2015 by narubianHorror293"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1777366","commentId":1777366,"userName":"narubianHorror293","timestamp":1441493639,"content":"Well, this is my first try at making a custom card, so go easy on me.   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI guess it probably has been done at least a few times already, but I felt like giving Magali's second beautiful treatment of Arwen a hero version.\n\n \n\nArwen-Undoacutemiel-Front-Face_zpswho4wy [http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac21/narubianHorror293/Custom%20LotR%20LCG%20Cards/Arwen-Undoacutemiel-Front-Face_zpswho4wyxr.jpg]\n\n \n\nFirst, I think that she's a viable hero by the virtue of her stat line alone;  She has the lowest starting threat of any hero with 3 willpower short of Sglorfindel, even lower than Sam's. This because she has almost no \"wasted\" points. As we know from heroes like Beregond, Eowyn and Galadriel, single purpose heroes with dedicated stat lines are a rare and precious thing. Also, Spirit only has three heroes with 3 or more willpower - Sglorfindel, Eowyn and Galadriel (and beardy, soon, of course). So she's a nice alternative to Eowyn if you don't want to run her, or specifically want to run a Noldor, or maybe you are playing multiplayer and Eowyn is taken and you need a cheap spirit quester (Galadriel doesn't quest from turn one, so it's not exactly the same part).\n\n \n\nSecond, I wanted to give her a cool and thought-provoking ability that is not straight out strong, and reflects her role in the books. Obviously, it couldn't be something confrontational, but rather something that represent the way she provided support and willpower to others; her general role in motivating Aragorn for sure, but also specific acts like making the Livery of Elendil herself, which her brothers then take to Aragorn before he enters the Paths of the Dead, and her noticing and taking care of Frodo's illness after the War of the Ring by giving him her \"spot\" on a ship to the undying lands and a white gem she wore on a chain. Also, since we know Celebrian gave here the Elfstone/Elessar, but also that Galadriel gave it to Aragorn when the Fellowship visits Lorien, I think it is safe to say that she asked Galadriel to give it to Aragorn as a gift and a boon.\n\n \n\nI hope this manages to stay close to her ally ability, but still giving it an interesting twist. She is a classic quester in that you know that you almost always want to quest with her, as her ability doesn't clash with it. However, rather than a static boost, it gives you the ability to return a questing character to defend from some unexpected enemy that will engage you, in case you miscalculated. Of course, you can also use this just to get +1 defense on a character meant to defend from an enemy already engaged with you, but you then run the risk of not having that character ready to defend if no enemy shows up, which means you have to think a little (which I like about abilities), and that the ability is stronger when combined with the right elements/mechanics (which I also like), in this case scrying.\n\n \n\nSecond, I knew I wanted to give her a version of the Elfstone:\n\nCelebrians-Stone-Front-Face_zpssjyauwkd. [http://i882.photobucket.com/albums/ac21/narubianHorror293/Custom%20LotR%20LCG%20Cards/Celebrians-Stone-Front-Face_zpssjyauwkd.jpg]\n\n \n\nI would have preferred calling it Stone of Eärendil, but this had to be the same name as the core set one as this is the same item. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nI'm not 100% sure about the sphere; I think giving willpower makes sense, atleast considering the hope it was meant to give to Aragorn, and the version of the story where Celebrimor makes a second Elessar, after the first was lost, to bring joy and hope to Galadriel. However, it was also specifically said that \"the hands of one who held it brought to all that they touched healing from hurt\", so I wanted it to have some healing effect, hence my uncertainty between Lore and Spirit. Giving Arwen a lore icon when she wears it emphasizes more the healing powers of the stone, and Arwen's special ownership and connection to the stone (she did receive it from her mother and carried it for who knows how many years). Finally, in the 17 years in which the game takes place, it might as well be in the possession of Arwen, as she might have given it to Galadriel just a short while before the fellowship forms.\n\n \n\nSo, what do you think?   :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\nEdited September 5, 2015 by narubianHorror293"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1777406","commentId":1777406,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1441497752,"content":"It's high time we get an Arwen hero!

Generally, if you are doing things that are the specialty of another sphere, you give it some kind of flavor that makes it fit into the new sphere. Secret Vigil is an excellent example. NarubianHorror's card is another decent example.

And your version completely kills the identity of the card itself. \n\n \n\nWell, that's your opinion.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  Obviously, I didn't meant my opinion is the god-given truth, only that that is how I feel about the card. I personally think that willpower boosts in tactics should be dependent on combat-related triggers. I think tactics Theoden should be considered the exception, because I believe that if it is taken as the rule, and we have even just one or two more static, unconditioned willpower boosts in tactics - like your card - mono-tactic decks will be able to quest quite successfully (and it might be not too hard to achieve), which I think shouldn't be the case.\n\n \n\nAs to the core set thing - I didn't realize you we're aiming to design a card that will go into the core set. I wasn't, in any case; I was rather aiming to design a card that would play nicely with the current card pool and meta, and will sit along side Horn of Gondor rather than replacing it. Furthermore, if core set is what you're aiming for, I think your card will be even more of a sphere-breaker in the core set, because the willpower boost for tactics precedent was not set then (not suprising, given there are exactly two tactics cards in the entire game that even have the willpoer symbol printed in the card text - Theoden and Halfling Determination), and it would have made the borders between the different spheres less clear and sharp, which I think is important in the core set, as it sets the tone and player expectations for the rest of the game.\n\n \n\nRegarding the identity of the card, I think my version really kind of captures it, as it uses one of the thematic ways in which the spirit and will of Rohan characters are represented in the game, where much of their power and motivation comes from characters dying (being discarded). I even think that getting willpower from characters dying is more of a Rohan thing (think Ride to Ruin, although that's progress and not willpower), where imagine them getting all pumped and excited with some speeches about their fallen comrades, while getting resource out of discarded characters feels more Gondor like, and even specifically Horn of Gondor-like, as a dying character (Boromir) blows the horn in his last moments to summon more allies (resources to pay for them), or perhaps Gondor sends more forces to where a military defeat has occurred. That's the way I imagine it, anyway.  :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]  \n\n \n\nFinally, from your tone I get the feeling you were offended by my reply, and even that you are generally offended by my version of the card. I don't think it's that bad!  :P [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_tongue.png] Anyway, my point is that I think this thread - and this forum generally - are for us to share our opinions and discuss this game that we love so much. Specifically, I think you can expect to always gets some comments and discussion on your creations that you post here - and that is a good thing. In my reply, I meant only to convey my opinion about the card, and to develop a discussion regarding this idea that intrigued me; I don't think that your card is wrong, or that you're stupid and that you don't \"get the game!\" or don't \"get the meta!\". I simply have a different idea on how to translate a concept from the books to card form, and how it combines in the current card pool. \n\n \n\nI'm generally a guy who prefers subtler cards with subtle effects, that combine in some small ways with cards released all throughout the game, and that require building around them, and matching them to the correct deck type and mechanics to get them to work - and even then they should only be pretty good, only one part of a well-oiled machine. In MtG terms [http://archive.wizards.com/Magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtgcom/daily/mr11b], I'm a Johnny.  I don't think that I would ever design a card that is outright strong and that is almost an auto-include in any deck, like your card (zero cost for +1 willpower, for me at least, means auto-include in any tactics deck). And that's OK. It's OK we have different opinions about things, and I think we should keep discussing them without using offending language (\"kills the identity\" was kind of strong, I think. It's not nice to read that about something you did :( [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_sad.png] ).\n\n \n\n \n\n> I'm not sure why you didn't just make it exhaust to give 1 willpower as a response rather than going through all that weirdness of not reading and then reading as a response.\n\n \n\nBecause usually allies leave play during the combat phase, so that would mean only getting the boost when you trigger some effect with an ally that can choose to leave play, or when a treachery kills an enemy. Which is even less-powerful and more subtle. I like it! (if you read the previous part of this reply, you know that that's my thing). I think that a one-cost attachment that says \"While committed to a quest, attached hero gains \"Response: after an ally leaves play, ready attached hero. It gets +1 willpower until the end of the phase. (Limit 3 times per phase.)\"\" will be pretty cool!\n\n \n\nI would like to try and make it work in a deck that fits this mechanically (Rohan + Silvan? Or a two handed Rohan deck + Silvan deck?). It wouldn't be very strong; which is good. :) [//content.invisioncic.com/Mfantflight/emoticons/default_smile.png]\n\n \n\n> The more I think about NarubianHorror's card though, the more I feel that it's just an even weaker version of Favor of the Lady on the Tactics sphere.

I like that it's subtle and will be outright weak when played in an unsuitable deck.\n\n \n\n> I think one resource per round is maybe too much of a nerf, but I have no problem with +1 willpower in tactics, especially for a unique attachment. I'm not even sure it would make most decks.\n\n \n\nI think some limitation should be in place. Maybe twice per round? I think you wouldn't want to see Tactics exploding with resource.\n\n \n\n> I reduced cost from 1 to 0 because of the exhaustion again.

It's only half a hero - only resources, not the hero type - so it's not a sword thain, and can only replace a dead hero. I like it a lot! I don't know if it's too strong with 1 cost (given that hero resurrection cost 5, and that sword thain is 4), but I think with either 1 or 2 it's an incredibly solid design.

Also, as written, his name is different then the old Hirluin and could be played together by the rules.\n\n \n\nAscendent Champion is really cool and unique. I like her. I would enjoy more if she had some kind of drawback Noldor related and costed 3, so being more viable and easier to play. She has Wandering Ent stats but you paid 1 resource to eliminate the enter exhausted drawback and 1 resource for her ability.

If played from full hand, Guardian of the Rim technically has 3def/1hp, which puts him behind the Defender of Rammas, but unlike Defender of Rammas, he sports a Sentinel keyword (which is relevant only with 2+ players). When compared to Watcher of Bruinen, they have the same amount of defensive stats in combination, (3def+1hp vs 2def+2hp), and both are Sentinel, however Watcher has an action advantage. But, if Guardian of the Rim is played with his condition in mind, he should outclass them, but the condition is hard and usually harmful for the player to meet, so it's a bargain (unless you're running a Noldor synergy)."},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/99847-creative-artwork-cards/?do=findComment&comment=1823094","commentId":1823094,"userName":"joezim007","timestamp":1443446725,"content":"Yup.
