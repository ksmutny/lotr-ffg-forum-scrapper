Adding a whole new conflict that late in the movie with the Scouring would take at least 20 more minutes to do properly and would have just broken the patience of the audience besides the really serious book fans. When it comes to pacing, a movie isn't as flexible as a book, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe movies aren't perfect, but I really enjoy them and I think many (though not all) of the changes were understandable. Of course, I'd rather play a game licensed on the books because the movies are just one incomplete interpretation of Tolkien's work.
