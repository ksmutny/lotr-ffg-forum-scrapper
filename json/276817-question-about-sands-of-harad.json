However, I really like the setting of Sands of Harad and its cycle. So, my question for everyone out there who has played and enjoyed this set: Do you think the difficulty is okay overall, considering my card pool? I heard it might be a better start for beginners to jump into than the previous expansions (which seemed to offer many new mechanics and a higher difficulty). Or would you strictly advise against it? \n\nAny help is much appreciated! Thanks a lot!"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276817-question-about-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=3353048","commentId":3353048,"userName":"Devaresh","timestamp":1527611702,"content":"If you check out authraw’s blog darklingdoor :\n\nhttps://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/ [https://darklingdoor.wordpress.com/path-less-traveled/]\n\nthere’s an article which explores sands of harad with a limited card pool.\n\nsome of the quests might be difficult but I think most could be done with what you have.\n\nits a great cycle and I’d say go for it since it’s got good quests and player cards, and also very importantly it’s probably in stock!\n\nalso welcome to the game!\n\nEdited May 29, 2018 by Devaresh"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276817-question-about-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=3353166","commentId":3353166,"userName":"Wandalf the Gizzard","timestamp":1527616402,"content":"It's not too hard as cycles go, but be aware that there are a couple quests that might be a bit of a curveball in terms of strategy.\n\nEdited May 29, 2018 by Wandalf the Gizzard\ncycle vs. quests"},{"commentUrl":"https://community.fantasyflightgames.com/topic/276817-question-about-sands-of-harad/?do=findComment&comment=3353543","commentId":3353543,"userName":"Authraw","timestamp":1527633784,"content":"You should be just fine jumping into Sands with that card pool.
